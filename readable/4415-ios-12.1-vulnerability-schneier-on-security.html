</p><p>[...]</p><p>A bad actor would need physical access to the phone that they are targeting and has a few options for viewing the victim's contact information. They would need to either call the phone from another iPhone or have the phone call itself. Once the call connects they would need to:</p><ul><li>Select the Facetime icon
</li><li>Select "Add Person"
</li><li>Select the plus icon
</li><li>Scroll through the contacts and use 3D touch on a name to view all contact information that's stored.</li></ul><p>Making the phone call itself without entering a passcode can be accomplished by either telling Siri the phone number or, if they don't know the number, they can say "call my phone." We tested this with both the owners' voice and a strangers voice, in both cases, Siri initiated the call.</p></div></div></div></div>
