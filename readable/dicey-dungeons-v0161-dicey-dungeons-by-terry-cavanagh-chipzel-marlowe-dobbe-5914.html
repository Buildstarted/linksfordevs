<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Hey all!<br></p>
<p>Just uploaded a minor bugfix update for this week's big update! Here's the changelog:</p>

<p><strong>Design changes:</strong><br>&nbsp;Jester:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - "Ice shatter" has been made more powerful.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - "Flame Blast" countdown reduced from 5 to 4.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Jester's Level 2 rewards are now booster packs instead of single cards.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Small changes to item distribution of floors 1 and 2 of Jester.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Finale cards show info about finale cards when you collect them (this is a bit messy, but will do for now).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Jester can now find any random finale card, instead of just Dice Cannon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Removed Jester Finale Card trading post.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Added a health pickup to "Losers, Weepers" floor 1.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Slot machine no longer creates player skillcards or episode specific cards.<br>&nbsp;Witch:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Witch can't find Spare dice cards anymore.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Added Catastrophe to witch dice pool.<br>&nbsp;Other:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Warrior episode "This'll be fine" now starts you with two Battle Axes instead of Ray Guns.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Changed Dragon's Fire Breath from 5 damage to 4.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Changed Cornelius's Nightmare card effect when weakened.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Scathach is no longer immune to shock and fire, but is now immune to lock. She is still immune to freeze.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Reduced poison recovery from upgraded healing crystal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Gym Leader's Earthquake+ now weakens 3 equipment, instead of all equipment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Changed Sneeze+ and Sharp Spike+.</p>
<p><strong>Bug fixes and updates:</strong><br>&nbsp;- Fixed at least one cause of the "Null Reference" crash errors: (not sure if I've got them all, though).<br>&nbsp;- Weakening Sneezy no longer causes a crash.<br>&nbsp;- Weakening "Second Wind" no longer causes a crash.<br>&nbsp;- Weakening Loud Bird no longer causes a softlock.<br>&nbsp;- Fixed the bug where some upgraded equipment would return to its original size when weakened.<br>&nbsp;- Fixed the display on the "Warrior Smash" Jester card.<br>&nbsp;- Viewing Fire Breath's upgrade in editor no longer causes a crash.<br>&nbsp;- Hammer now correctly does lightning damage, and shovel does earth damage.<br>&nbsp;- Fixed layout of Scathach's equipment.<br>&nbsp;- Fixed a bug where Slot Machine stays at the front of your deck after use.<br>&nbsp;- Fixed broken footsteps sound.<br>&nbsp;- Combat music now stops when you flee.<br>&nbsp;- Episode tooltips from character selection don't appear in the editor anymore.<br>&nbsp;- Fixed wrong HD texture size in cutscenes.<br>&nbsp;- Fixed broken effect on Venus Fly Trap+.<br>&nbsp;- Flamethrower no longer disappears if you upgrade it when your inventory is full.<br>&nbsp;- Irish translation has been updated.</p>
<p><strong>Modding API changes and fixes:</strong><br>&nbsp;- Increased modding api number to 0.5.0.<br>&nbsp;- Updated demo Plastic Shield and Frogurt mods to 0.5.0.<br>&nbsp;- Combined the "description" and "extended" columns on equipment.csv, with | characters as line breaks. (sorry, I know this is going to cause some headaches with existing mods, but it needed to be done to support more than two lines for non-english languages in future!)<br>&nbsp;- New "Special?" column in equipment.csv lets you specify that a piece of equipment shouldn't appear in the getequipment() list. (i.e. skillcards, etc)<br>&nbsp;- In equipment.csv, renamed "Script" column to "Script: On Execute".<br>&nbsp;- In equipment.csv, fighters.csv, and episodes.csv, there are now four columns, "Script: Before Combat", "Script: After Combat", "Script: Start Turn" and "Script: End Turn". These run at various points on the player, enemy or piece of equipment.<br>&nbsp;- All script hooks are tested, and should now work as expected.<br>&nbsp;- "Call for Backup" style cards display correctly if used as skillcards.<br>&nbsp;- Simplified the custom variable system - now that you can run scripts at the start and end of turns, and the start and end of combat, you don't need the different types of variables! (usage: variables need to be attached to a fighter, like this: self.getvar(varname) and self.setvar(varname, value));<br>&nbsp;- Cutscene view flag now saved and loaded correctly for modded cutscenes.<br>&nbsp;- Custom modded level generators and modded cutscenes now load correctly.</p></section><section><h2>Files</h2></section><section><h2>Get Dicey Dungeons</h2></section></div></div></div>
