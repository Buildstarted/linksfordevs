<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <div>
    <div id="content"><p>Django is currently the most commonly used full-stack web framework for Python. It has
been around for a good 15 years, emerging as a winner from a period in which
Python was already mature, but its web development tools were comparatively
much more immature and fragmented.</p>
<p>Django allows the definition of objects in your program as "models" using the
<tt>Model</tt> base class. They behave largely like normal Python classes, with
added support to save into, and retrieve from, the relational database backing
your application. If you don't need such database support, you didn't
need a full-stack web framework in first place.</p>
<p>Django tries to be independent from the database you choose. It sounds like
a good idea, but only on paper. After working several years
with Django systems, both written from scratch or inherited and maintained, I
feel the "blessed" way of working with databases and
Django leads you to using your database in a sub-optimal way, and unnecessarily complicates
the development and maintenance cycle of your project.</p>
<p>I think the divergence between wishful thinking and reality starts from a
fundamental misunderstanding between you and Django, which is not written in
the contract you haven't signed with them anyway:</p>
<blockquote>
"independence from the relational database" is a feature needed by Django
as a framework, <em>not by the program you are writing</em>.</blockquote>
<p>Django needs it because a web framework not tied to a single database vendor
is more valuable than one tied to a specific one - and that's fair enough. <em>But you
don't:</em> your web program, most likely than not, will not have to switch from
one database to another. So, <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html">You Ain't Gonna Need Itâ„¢</a>. Portability at all costs
leads to at least two problems:</p>
<p>1) You will not able to use all the features offered by your relational
database.</p>
<p>2) Every change to your models, or to your database schema, will be more
complicated than it should be.</p>
<div id="you-ain-t-gonna-need-it">
<h3>You Ain't Gonna Need It</h3>
<p>How many times have you worked on a project and, after 1-2 years of
development, you have changed to a different database?</p>
<p>I can tell you how many times it happened to me, I counted them: exactly
never.</p>
<p>Replacing your database vendor is a major, traumatic occurrence, almost as
much as rewriting your program in a different language. If you replace your
database, more likely than not, it is because you are interested in the
features of the new databas. You need to use them so using the common
functionalities between the old and the new one will not solve any of your
problems.</p>
<p>Did you maybe start your project with SQLite and now your project grew enough
to need a bigger database? If so then you are still at the phase in
which your project is a toy: you haven't done anything yet that requires
thinking in terms of concurrency. Even if you have to rewrite a few things,
it's not going to be a lot.</p>
<p>Do you have a large MySQL project and now you have to migrate to PostgreSQL?
That's not gonna happen: you have probably tweaked MySQL, have expertise in
MySQL. Maybe PostgreSQL might be a better database in some aspects, but not so much
that you want to migrate all your data and start from scratch without
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/frobnicate.html">frobbing, twiddling, tweaking</a> the database configuration. Did you say
you have High Availability and Disaster Recovery configured? That's to be
converted too of course.</p>
<p>In the above paragraph, replace the database vendor with all the permutations
of MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, Oracle. <em>That's not gonna happen</em>. Except maybe
if an Oracle salesman gets hold of someone in your project with a modicum of
decision making and talks them into buying some sort of expensive license, but
that's not a technical problem, it's a political one, and it's up to you to
decide if you are comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Have you got PostgreSQL in production, but you want to test with SQLite because
it's easier to set up? If so, your tests are just a tick-box exercise: you
are not testing anything remotely plausible and resembling your live system.</p>
<p>Choosing a database happens in the first days of your projects, it will not
happen when the project is mature. You may as well use all the features
available with your database, not only the ones common enough that Django
created a Python wrapper for it.</p>
</div>
<div id="use-all-the-features">
<h3>Use all the features</h3>
<p>Scanning the schema of a Django program I've written and maintained for a few
years I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schemas (as in the "directory of the tables", not all the other meanings)</li>
<li>Custom domains</li>
<li>Collations</li>
<li>Triggers</li>
<li>Permissions</li>
<li>Partial indexes</li>
<li>Constraint exclusions</li>
<li>Views</li>
<li>Stored procedures</li>
<li>Partitioned tables</li>
</ul>
<p>If these features were used, it's because they allowed to implement
certain features needed for the program in a simpler way than what possible in
the language (if even would have been possible there). Audit for
instance: Django doesn't have an audit feature except for the changes made in
the admin. Even if you added some form of manual auditing to each <tt>save()</tt>
method, it will not capture changes made outside Django. It wouldn't be very
secure either: Django uses a single user to access the database so if someone
manages to hijack that user, they would be able to change the data in the database
and alter the audit tables to hide their traces.</p>
<p>In PostgreSQL you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an "audit" user: it will have different permissions than the user of
the Django application.</li>
<li>Create an "audit" schema: revoking write permission to all the objects it
will contain from the Django user.</li>
<li>Create a function to append a record to an audit table owned by the "audit"
user, but callable by the Django user.</li>
<li>Add a trigger to the tables to audit.</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup requires Postgres-specific knowledge, which is fair for a feature
that has to watch over the database data whichever the origin of the change
is. But being PostgreSQL extensible as it is, you can <a href="https://github.com/dvarrazzo/pgaudit">use an extension</a> to automate the creation and
maintenance of the audit triggers and functions.</p>
</div>
<div id="so-where-do-i-put-the-schema">
<h3>So where do I put the schema?</h3>
<p>Into an SQL file!</p>
<p>With its tiny <tt>.sql</tt> extension!</p>
<p>And with comments! Explaining why a certain index or constraint exist!</p>
<p>With constraints named meaningfully, available for manipulation, not
<tt>auth_group_permissions_group_id_b120cbf9_fk_auth_group_id</tt>.</p>
<p>Sounds civilised to me.</p>
<p>The nice thing of doing this is that, if you do things carefully enough, Django
will not notice anything at all.</p>
<p>Take the above audit examples: Django is not meant to interact with it:
everything will just happen under its nose. You can use views instead of
tables for read-only models, you can use domains instead of more basic data
types for your fields: Django won't see your triggers triggering, your
constraints constraining, your permissions permitting - except when things go
wrong, which will result in an error 500 and a Python traceback. This is at least
better than bad data in the database. Also it won't see your procedures
proceeding, your domains dominating...you get the idea.</p>
<p>Using psql to import the schema into an empty database means you can modularise the
code and use <tt>\i</tt> to import "submodules". A typical pattern for me is to have
a <tt>database.sql</tt> to create global objects (users, extensions, schemas),
set the basic permissions and import the details into target schemas.</p>
<pre><span>\</span><span>i</span> <span>users</span><span>.</span><span>sql</span>

</pre>
<p>The <tt>database.sql</tt> doesn't create the database itself so you can create an
empty one anywhere it's needed, then you can use <tt>psql <span>-f</span> database.sql
<span>"postgres://connection/url"</span></tt> to populate it. The <tt>myapp.sql</tt> file
shouldn't contain any reference to the schema <tt>myapp</tt> where the objects are
created so the schama can be easily changed. Postgres doesn't have a statement like
<tt>CREATE USER ... IF NOT EXIST</tt>: in <tt>users.sql</tt> you can simulate it with:</p>

<div id="migrations">
<h3>Migrations</h3>
<p>Django has an amazingly complex system to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/migrations/">perform model migrations</a>. It is
complex amongst other reasons because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It actually migrates <em>Python models</em> not <em>database schemas</em>. Even if you change a field's help
text, it generates a migration.</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>Migration</span><span>(</span><span>migrations</span><span>.</span><span>Migration</span><span>):</span>

    <span>operations</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>migrations</span><span>.</span><span>AlterField</span><span>(</span>
            <span>model_name</span><span>=</span><span>'foo'</span><span>,</span>
            <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>'bar'</span><span>,</span>
            <span>field</span><span>=</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>BooleanField</span><span>(</span><span>help_text</span><span>=</span><span>'I only changed this'</span><span>),</span>
        <span>),</span>
</pre>
<p>That's not useful at all for the database, but Django will create it for you
and if you remove it, it will add it back. Similarly, changing a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#choices">choices
list</a>, a display label, results in migrations with no database operation,
only a Python operation, and practically no SQL purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It allows access to the state of the model at times intermediate between
migrations, using <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/applications/#django.apps.AppConfig.get_models">get_model</a><tt>(appname, modelname)</tt> and with some
Python code in the returned model. But if that code also happens to use
any code inside your application, importing models with a normal Python
<tt>import</tt>, things will crash because of a mismatch between model
definitions and schema in the database. But they won't crash immediately: only
later when you will apply some unrelated migration. And not when that
migration is needed: only after it has already been applied and it doesn't
have anything more to do in its lifetime: it is implemented as a model that
Django will keep on importing over and over. In a project I'm currently
working on, I had to add this function into our codebase:</p>
<pre><span>def</span> <span>can_run</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>models</span><span>):</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>with</span> <span>transaction</span><span>.</span><span>atomic</span><span>():</span>
            <span>for</span> <span>model</span> <span>in</span> <span>models</span><span>:</span>
                <span>model</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>all</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>first</span><span>()</span>
    <span>except</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
</pre>
<p>And use it as a whack-a-mole to avoid already applied migrations from exploding,
adding early bailouts like:</p>
<pre><span>def</span> <span>data_migration</span><span>(</span><span>apps</span><span>,</span> <span>schema_editor</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>can_run</span><span>(</span><span>Model1</span><span>,</span> <span>Model2</span><span>,</span> <span>Model3</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span>

    <span># ...the stuff I meant to do</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Migration</span><span>(</span><span>migrations</span><span>.</span><span>Migration</span><span>):</span>
    <span>operations</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>migrations</span><span>.</span><span>RunPython</span><span>(</span><span>data_migration</span><span>),</span>
    <span>]</span>
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>It detects changes to your models and infers how to change the schema.
This is pretty much impossible to do in an automated way, except in the
simplest cases. So the feature is incomplete, and when it thinks it
knows what it's doing, often it doesn't and it's hard to tell it to stop.</p>
<p>In a case I experienced, my model <tt>Foo</tt> needed some extra pepper to its attribute
<tt>bar</tt>. So we thought to fetch the data from the database into a hidden
<tt>_bar</tt> attribute and then have a Python property to expose it:</p>
<pre> class Foo(models.Model):

<span>-    bar = models.CharField(
</span><span>+    _bar = models.CharField(
</span>         max_length=255,
<span>+        db_column='bar',
</span>     )
<span>+
+    @property
+    def bar(self):
+        return something_more()</span>
</pre>
<p>No change needed to the database, but Django insisted on creating migration
consisting pretty much of:</p>
<pre><span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>foo</span> <span>DROP</span> <span>COLUMN</span> <span>bar</span><span>;</span>
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>foo</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>COLUMN</span> <span>bar</span><span>;</span>
</pre>
<p>So goodbye to your data! But who needs a <tt>bar</tt> anyway. Although I think I could've
used a bar, and a few drinks, if that migration had hit production.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the complexity of this system is designed to give you a specific
feature: migrations abstracted from your database. In my opinion, if there is
something less likely to happen than writing a complex app to run on
interchangeable databases, it's the need to repeat the same history of
migrations. The cost you pay for this YAGNI feature is a cumbersome and
fragile system trying to have a life of its own whilst fighting yours. It is a
direct application of <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremydmiller/status/568797862441586688">Jeremy Miller's observation</a> that <em>any extensibility
point thatâ€™s never used isnâ€™t just wasted effort, itâ€™s likely to also get in
your way as well</em>.</p>
<p>I may be a bit of a control freak, but I think that there is too much magic
here and too few hooks to intervene to correct it, all playing too close with my
data to feel comfortable. This comes with the advantage of being able to
replay your migrations in the future on a different database vendor, but I
struggle to find a valid use case for it not involving parallel universes and
time machines.</p>
</div>
<div id="so-what-do-i-use-instead-of-migrations">
<h3>So what do I use instead of migrations?</h3>
<p>You can use SQL files! Yes, same extensions as before. It takes some
discipline, but it rewards with great control of the behaviour of the database
and the safety of the data. The work involved consists in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing your database and its data definition and manipulation language: to
know how to change the schema and the data associated.</li>
<li>If you have the database schema in source control, when you change the
schema, you will usually want to associate a similar "schema patch". An
ex-colleague of mine wrote a script to "prime" a migration with the right name
and a comment containing the diff of the schema, to give an idea of what to
do.</li>
<li>You can have a database table recording the schema patches already applied
to the database and a script to look for unapplied patches: run them,
and record them into the table, to run on deployment.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a <a href="https://gist.github.com/dvarrazzo/86b06961fa3278293e193417adbf3daf">patch_db.py</a> script that I have used, with small variations, in
several projects. It is meant to be executed as a database superuser so that
the application user can be given only limited privileges: enough to read and
change the data it needs. No need to be a superuser or to own the tables to be
able to change their schema. A few features of this simple script include:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the database had never been patched, it creates a <tt>schema_patch</tt> table
and registers the patches available, as already applied.</li>
<li>If the table exists, it compares the content of the patches directory with
the table content and applies and registers the missing patches in
alphabetical order. You can use the date as prefix to make sure they are
applied in the correct order.</li>
<li>It keeps an advisory lock for the entire run to make sure that there will
not be two patching processes running concurrently by mistake.</li>
<li>The patching process is identifiable in PostgreSQL via its appname so it
can be monitored and dealt with, in case it behaves unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Patches can be applied one by one, with interactive user confirmation, or
unattended for automatic deployment.</li>
<li>You can associate executable scripts to a patch, to run before or after it,
to implement procedures difficult to implement in SQL: you can have
<tt>my_patch.pre.sh</tt> and <tt>my_patch.post.py</tt> to run respectively before and
after <tt>my_patch.sql</tt> is applied, receiving a <tt>PATCH_DSN</tt> environment
variable to know where to connect to.</li>
</ul>
<p>The script is independent from Django; if used in a Django project it might be
reimplemented as a management command, but I have never felt compelled to do
so.</p>
<p>Once this script is integrated with your deployment procedures, there are these
few examples of patches that can be produced, scanning the patches directory
of projects I have worked with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a field to a table, populate it with data obtained querying other
database tables.</li>
<li>Move a field to another table, split a table into two joined tables, change a
relation from one-to-many to many-to-many without losing the current
relations.</li>
<li>Partition previously unpartitioned data by creating partitions, moving
data into them, and emptying the base table.</li>
<li>Add a new currency to the currencies table, change the name of that Balkan
nation to "Republic of North Macedonia", remove that island from the
list of European Union nations, or any other change to some "configuration
table".</li>
<li>Fix data after a bug producing wrong data was discovered.</li>
<li>Add a new Django group and set the group permissions or add new objects'
permissions to existing groups.</li>
<li>Create a normal column for a piece of data that was previously stored in an
unstructured way into a JSON field, remove the data from the JSON and move
it to the new field.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, Django migrations create automatically only the simplest of
operations, like adding a new (empty) column or dropping a column. Renaming a
column is already an operation fraught with perils, and manipulating data
using Python models while the models themselves are being altered, is a task of
ShrÃ¶dingeranean complexity.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-it-difficult-to-write-patches">
<h3>Is it difficult to write patches?</h3>
<p>Most of the time writing an SQL patch is simpler than writing a
patch in the Django migration system. The latter is something that, in order to achieve
successfully, requires knowledge not so much of the database, but rather of the
migration system itself.</p>
<p>Looking at a few examples, taken directly from Django's own <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/writing-migrations/">writing
migrations</a> page:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/writing-migrations/#migrations-that-add-unique-fields">Adding a non-nullable field</a> in Django migrations involves creating the
normal migration, i.e. the one creating a
<tt>field=models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4, unique=True)</tt>, creating
two empty ones (it's suggested to use <tt>makemigrations myapp <span>--empty</span></tt>
because there's a certain amount of boilerplate involved), and pretty much
have a sequence of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a field with the default, but nullable</li>
<li>Fill it with values (using a <tt>RunPython</tt> step)</li>
<li>Make it non-nullable</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a bit of a race condition between object creation whilst the
migration has been applied.</p>
<p>The same steps, in SQL, take much less boilerplate: in one patch you can:</p>
<pre><span>BEGIN</span><span>;</span>
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>myapp_mymodel</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>uuid</span> <span>uuid</span><span>;</span>
<span>UPDATE</span> <span>myapp_mymodel</span> <span>SET</span> <span>uuid</span> <span>=</span> <span>uuid_generate_v4</span><span>();</span>
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>myapp_mymodel</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>uuid</span> <span>SET</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>COMMIT</span><span>;</span>
</pre>
<p>Or variations of the above (if you want the default generated by the
database, a non-locking operation on a large table, a unique constraint...)</p>

<p>The whole example is 64 lines of code that make sense only if you know the

<div id="commands-you-don-t-want-to-use">
<h3>Commands you don't want to use</h3>
<p>Once you have introduced your migration procedures, and motivated your team
into using them, these are a few operations you can use to replace the
official ways of involving Django migrations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>manage.py migrate</tt>: the first time (e.g. new dev setup, unit tests) you
can run <tt>psql <span>-f</span> database.sql</tt>. If you do it in a test suite run, you will
have tested your schema too. If an initial schema is already in place
(deployment in staging and production, distributing changes to other
developers) you can run something similar to the proposed <a href="https://gist.github.com/dvarrazzo/86b06961fa3278293e193417adbf3daf">patch_db.py</a>
and have tested the patches too.</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>manage.py makemigrations</tt>: run <tt>git diff <span>schema/*.sql</span></tt> and work out
what you have to do, like all the other times you wanted to use the Django
command that didn't do everything you needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>manage.py sqlmigrate</tt>: replaced by <tt>cat</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>manage.py showmigrations</tt>: you can use <tt>patch_db.py <span>--dry-run</span></tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>manage.py squashmigrations</tt>: ...I am in awe of the complexity of
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/migrations/#migration-squashing">squashmigraitons</a>. It reduces your many migrations to an undetermined
number of fewer migrations, conditioned by the time you have been creative
and have used SQL or Python in them. You can mark operations as "elidable",
if you want to have them dropped, but be careful of
<tt>CircularDependencyError</tt>, although you can use <tt><span>--no-optimize</span></tt>...</p>
<p>You can replace squashmigrations with <tt>rm</tt>.</p>
<p>Once the migrations have been applied to all your testing and production
systems, and all your developers' databases, just remove them. Or leave them
where they are: who cares. Even if they stay there, even thousands of them
won't do any harm to your program's start-up time: they are not automatically
imported modules. If you want to keep them and not drown in patches, you can
divide them into month or year directories, and change one line of the
<tt>patch_db</tt> script to find them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tips-to-write-a-migration">
<h3>Tips to write a migration</h3>
<p>Writing a complex migration consists of trying the operations to perform in a
testing database, which is often an iterative procedure of trial and error,
where mistakes are made, requiring to go back to the state before
migrating, and don't forget to add that semicolon!</p>
<p>A way to write a migration patch of the type described here consists roughly
of the below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a file in the <tt>schema/patches/</tt> directory called
<tt><span>YYYY-MM-DD_some_meaninfgul_description.sql</span></tt>. If you happen to write more
than one patch in the same day, and their order matters, you can add a <tt>~02</tt>
after the date to the name of the second patch and so on, as <tt>~</tt> sorts
after <tt>_</tt>.</li>
<li>Add a <tt>BEGIN;</tt> statement to the top of the file, followed by the
statements you want to test.</li>
<li>Connect to your test database with a psql shell and use <tt>\i
/path/to/your/patch.sql</tt> to try and apply your patch.</li>
<li>If applying the patch fails, run a <tt>ROLLBACK</tt> in psql, fix the error and try
<tt>\i</tt> again.</li>
<li>If applying succeeds, you can explore the database to verify that the changes
applied have produced the right results. You may want to run a <tt>SAVEPOINT
x</tt> command now. In case you mistype a command while verifying the results,
you can run <tt>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT x</tt> and revert the transaction to the
state just after the patch was applied.</li>
<li>Your patch applied ok, but you don't like the result? <tt>ROLLBACK</tt>, fix the
patch then try again.</li>
<li>If you are happy with what you see, you can <tt>ROLLBACK</tt> this psql transaction,
add a <tt>COMMIT;</tt> to the end of the patch script and run <tt>patch_db</tt>
to apply the patch just created for good. If, by mistake or intention, you
committed the psql changes, you can run <tt>patch_db</tt> interactively and "skip
forever" the patch when asked for confirmation.</li>
</ul>

<div id="another-random-bit-of-advice">
<h3>Another random bit of advice</h3>
<p>The motivation for writing this article comes from knowledge sharing with the
team I'm currently collaborating with, who are using Django the canonical way.
I am convinced they can better use the tools they have. Let's see if they can
be persuaded to drop Django migrations...</p>
<p>As I'm writing this entire brain dump, there's another trick that should be
filed under "know what your tool is doing". Sometimes Django pages become slow
because, adding something apparently harmless, such as accessing a model
attribute, results in unexpected queries running behind the scenes. If you do it in
a loop, it results in a "ripple load", meaning you'll run 50 queries, each one
fetching one record, while you could have run a single query fetching 50
records, or just adding an extra JOIN to another query.</p>
<p>How do you identify this problem? While you are developing using the development
server, you can log all the operations performed to the database adding the
following logger configuration to your <tt>settings.py</tt>:</p>
<pre><span>LOGGING</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span>'loggers'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span># ...</span>
        <span>'django.db'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>'handlers'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'console'</span><span>],</span>
            <span>'level'</span><span>:</span> <span>'DEBUG'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>},</span>
    <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
<p>You will get used to the amount of SQL blobs popping up in the dev server
log at each request. If you accidentally introduce a ripple load, it'll be
very easy to spot: a fast train of short statements will blaze into the log
console. Either it happens in Python code or in a template or as a result of
asynchronous ajax calls (not included in request-oriented tools, such as
the Django Debug Toolbar). It will be unmissable. Looking at these statements,
it's easy to understand what model caused it and the right
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#select-related">select_related()</a> to add.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-you-hate-django">
<h3>"Do you hate Django?"</h3>
<p>No, I don't. I still like it, although with Python moving towards asyncio and
<a href="https://www.varrazzo.com/blog/2020/03/31/first-experience-mypy/">static typing</a>, and with the established
web architecture of JSON APIs consumed by JavaScript front-ends, the appeal
for other frameworks such as <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> is
increasing. As opinionated about databases I am, I quite like the Django
ORM: very simple to use, well integrated with the Python objects it produces
and it allows you to write monsters of nested queries with great ease. Peeking at
the logs of the SQL statements produced for you by the <tt>django.db</tt> logger
fosters some admiration.</p>
<p>What I really don't like is when tools get in the way of someone's work.
Sometimes the tools are complex because the problem they try to solve is complex also. But
you are free to ask yourself this question: do I really have that problem? You
might get to the conclusion that you might not and you can make choices
against conventions to simplify your life.</p>
<p>In the case of Django, the right economy for me is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get to know the ORM features inside out and take full advantage of it to
query and manipulate data.</li>
<li>Avoid using the Models to produce the database schema, use the native
database language and tools instead.</li>
<li>Stay well clear of migrations.</li>
</ul>
