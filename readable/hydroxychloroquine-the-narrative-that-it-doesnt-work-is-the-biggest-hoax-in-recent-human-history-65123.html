<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="div_block-37-17"><p><span id="span-39-17"> <p>"I do not know Trump or Bolsonaro," <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://covexit.com/shock-testimony-of-professor-raoult-at-french-national-assembly/" target="_blank">said</a> Didier Raoult, a professor of infectious diseases at the IHU-Marseille, on 24 June, the French National Assembly, when provided a testimonial for a special commission.</p> <p>There I saw that the teacher has already started to understand the hole that got involved and who were responsible for creating the first wave that fucked him.</p> <p>This wave, after all, placed him, by chance, as an important piece at the center of the chessboard of the most ferocious geopolitical dispute since the end of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>In addition to the denial of knowing Trump or Bolsonaro, which is quite fun, where Raoult tried to distance himself from these two demented leaders, the infectologist reported serious things: he suffered <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://covexit.com/shock-testimony-of-professor-raoult-at-french-national-assembly/" target="_blank">death threats</a> soon after proposing the treatment of COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, two cheap and generic drugs.</p> <p>The doctor behind the threats was found. It’s from a university hospital in Nantes. Incidentally, he was the person who <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://covexit.com/shock-testimony-of-professor-raoult-at-french-national-assembly/" target="_blank">received the</a> most money from Gilead, a large pharmaceutical company, in the past 6 years.</p> <p>Here I propose to put together, piece by piece, the puzzle of what I consider the biggest farce in modern history. I don’t worry about producing a short text. It will have analyzes, including new ones, and from different points of view.</p> <p>It involves science, healing, politics, geopolitics, mass and group psychology. With the scenario set, it is not difficult to predict good and bad things that will happen in the coming months and years.</p> <p>Throughout the text, the reader will understand the most important thing: the circumstance of how this false narrative was put together. The reader will also be prompted, by itself, to conclude whether the treatment proposed by Didier Raout works or not.</p> <p>And you will also understand how the majority of the North American scientific class, from Latin America and Europe, regions of the globe under strong influence from the USA, were directed to an incredibly gross error.</p> <p>In addition to the facts and figures, which are accompanied by external links, all I write are my own opinions, based on the facts, in first person, from my point of view, of how I see the world going completely insane in front of me.</p> <p>I am not afraid to sign my name when publishing it, even though I know that the almost unanimity of Brazilian scientists are against the application of these drugs and repeat that “there is no scientific evidence” of the functioning.</p> <p>And one thing I’m sure will attract attention. The fact that I have to give examples with incredibly basic logic, as if I were talking to children, to explain the facts. It is necessary. The farce has gone so far that I need many examples and analogies to bring reason back.</p> <p>Signed, I make it available to cover me, today or in the future, if my analyzes prove to be incorrect, after all, it is not a simple or light claim.</p> <h2>In February there is carnival</h2> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA.jpeg" alt="china and europe" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA.jpeg 1000w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure> <p>From China and Europe came reports of large numbers of dead people and entire cities blocked, with people in confinement, preventing the transmission of the coronavirus.</p> <p>On the top street of my house, in Atibaia, in the interior of São Paulo, 60 km from the state capital, the carnival took place.</p> <p>For four days, loud music came through my window. I didn’t go to the party, which I do every year. The word agglomeration already bothered me.</p> <p>It was the end of February, just before the WHO — World Health Organization, declared that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brasil.elpais.com/sociedade/2020-03-11/oms-declara-que-coronavirus-e-uma-pandemia-global.html" target="_blank">we were in a global pandemic</a> of apocalyptic proportions.</p> <p>I preferred to go ahead and follow the guidance of scientists before government decisions. I was the first in the city to join voluntary confinement.</p> <p>A few days later I still went to a bar. I thought the risk was low. In airy environments, the risk is less. It was the last time I went to one. It was an open bar, something normal in our tropical climate, where half the people are on the street and the other half inside the establishment.</p> <p>It was the farewell of a musician friend. Samba and jazz were in the repertoire. He was already hired to go to Australia, where he would board a tourist ship. It would be one of the attractions. He was excited. I didn’t want to discourage him, but it was strange that the company was still confident, until that day, that new trips would come out, even with the Diamond Princess <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemia_de_COVID-19_no_navio_Diamond_Princess" target="_blank">case</a>, off the coast of Japan.</p> <p>I no longer held hands to greet anyone. I ran away from close contacts, always stayed outside, and washed my hands constantly. They laughed and found it strange. Some called me paranoid.</p> <p>I soon made a bad prediction: that all bars would be empty and closed in a short space of time. I decided not to leave anymore. I didn’t want to be bothered by crowds. I didn’t want to be a joke either. Our state and municipal governments had not yet taken action against the virus.</p> <p>At home, it remained to read, to follow the news and scientific publications that began to appear frequently. I have a habit, healthy or not, of going deeper into research, and reading studies, when I’m interested in a subject. I don’t like to just wait and see, one or the other news, superficially, in the mass media.</p> <p>The craze for going to medical research sites to read papers came from a few years earlier. In 2016 I broke a bone in an accident. Practically three months lying, with little mobility, without drinking, and with an IPAD in my hand, I read all the studies on my recovery, to the point that, in a chat, shortly afterwards, with an orthopedist professor at an important medical school, he says he has never seen a patient know so much about his problem. “This one studied more than my students”, he joked with a friend.</p> <h2>Piece 1: the hydroxychloroquine solution appears</h2> <p>March 17, 2020</p> <p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hydroxychloroquine_final_DOI_IJAA.pdf" target="_blank">The study ran the internet.</a> He had this impressive chart. People who took hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, an antibiotic, made a spectacular and rapid recovery.</p> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_tRu6o_eP9Nhtb0Qk_DxkoQ.jpg" alt="hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin results" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_tRu6o_eP9Nhtb0Qk_DxkoQ.jpg 893w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_tRu6o_eP9Nhtb0Qk_DxkoQ-300x160.jpg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_tRu6o_eP9Nhtb0Qk_DxkoQ-768x410.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px"><figcaption>Study graph.</figcaption></figure> <p>By the fifth day, the six patients who received the combination no longer had the virus. The news was so good that I went to find out where it came from.</p> <p>The differences between the other two arms, control and those who only took hydroxychloroquine, were great.</p> <p>They didn’t even wait to finish. On the sixth day they already released these preliminary data.</p> <p>Several scientists signed the study, but the main one was Didier Raoult, from Marseille, in the south of France. I went to research and soon saw that he was not just any adventurer.</p> <h2>Piece 2: Didier Raoult is the leading specialist in communicable diseases in the world</h2> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_MWN7NMuqGJt2kJlOqcRXOQ-1024x576.jpeg" alt="didier raoult - hydroxychloroquine researcher" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_MWN7NMuqGJt2kJlOqcRXOQ-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_MWN7NMuqGJt2kJlOqcRXOQ-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_MWN7NMuqGJt2kJlOqcRXOQ-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_MWN7NMuqGJt2kJlOqcRXOQ.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure> <p>Didier has almost <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22Raoult%20D%22%5BAuthor%5D" target="_blank">3,000 articles</a> in Pubmed. This is a resounding number.</p> <p>According to the Expertscape website, which makes a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://expertscape.com/ex/communicable+diseases" target="_blank">statistic</a> &nbsp;about studies published in the last 10 years by specialty, he is number one in the world in communicable diseases.</p> <p>In addition, he won several awards in his scientific community, such as that of the National Institute of Health and Medical Research, in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://histoire.inserm.fr/de-l-inh-a-l-inserm/les-prix-inserm/prix-2010" target="_blank">2010</a>, and that of the Institute of France, in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://grands-prix.institut-de-france.fr/didier-raoult" target="_blank">2015</a>.</p> <p>This second prize is not just any prize, like those in cities in the interior that hold contests on the internet for the most sympathetic doctors in public service. It is a cash prize. He took 200 thousand Euros home. This is more than one million reais.</p> <p>Professor Didier Raoult also received decorations from the French government. He is, since 2015, commander of the National Order of Merit, and since 2011, Officer of the Legion of Honor. One of them is awarded by the President of the Republic of the country. And we all know that France is not a banana republic. They don’t reward imbeciles.</p> <p>With a brilliant career like this, I decided to keep following. The results were too encouraging to pass up.</p> <h2>Piece 3: the world’s second worst ally liked the idea</h2> <figure><div>  </div></figure> <p><strong>March 21st</strong></p> <p>Donald Trump, the president of the United States, is anything but simple. Four days after publication, he went on TV and used Didier Raoult’s study as a confrontation with American scientists. They spared no <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/climate/trump-coronavirus-climate-science.html" target="_blank">criticism</a> for their stupidity in conducting the pandemic.</p> <p>He always hit them head on. Trump is a blundering rotary machine gun. Just to give two examples, on the pandemic, he had <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-trump-flu-deaths-tweet-think-about-that-162332056.html" target="_blank">said that the</a> common&nbsp; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-trump-flu-deaths-tweet-think-about-that-162332056.html" target="_blank">flu</a> was worse. And it unbelievably went so far as to say that the coronavirus was a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/trump-says-the-coronavirus-is-the-democrats-new-hoax.html%20Trump%20diz%20que%20o%20coronav%C3%ADrus%20%C3%A9%20a%20%E2%80%98nova%20farsa%E2%80%99%20dos%20democratas" target="_blank">farce</a> from the Democratic party.</p> <p>His track record has always been to nurture disdain for science and scientists. He says, for example, that he <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/11/27/internacional/1543283242_634443.html" target="_blank">doesn’t believe</a> in global warming.</p> <p>But one thing Trump has always known: his policy of confrontation pleases his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://noticias.uol.com.br/internacional/ultimas-noticias/2020/03/16/por-coronavirus-populacao-dos-eua-faz-fila-para-comprar-armas-e-municao.htm" target="_blank">stupid</a>, increasingly radicalized base, which in order to defend itself against the coronavirus, instead of avoiding agglomerations, is lining up to buy weapons.</p> <p>How can someone who acts and thinks in this way guide how the solution to a pandemic should be?</p> <p>Of course, the North American scientific community felt neglected, and with the clash, diminished. They reacted.</p> <h2>Piece 4: hydroxychloroquine’s first misfortune</h2> <p>In his ad, Trump spoke the name of the drug. And hydroxychloroquine, unfortunately, did not need a doctor’s prescription.</p> <p>What happened? A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/03/declaracao-de-trump-cria-corrida-por-hidroxicloroquina-em-farmacias-de-washington.shtml" target="_blank">rush to the pharmacies</a>. Nothing surprising.</p> <p>Experts were consulted. They said an obviousness that anyone would say seeing the people stocking up on medicines. They warned that everyone should be careful with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mayo-clinic-cardiologist-inexcusable-ignore-hydroxychloroquine-side-effects-n1178776" target="_blank">side effects</a>.</p> <p>Following, honest journalism, which I would also do. They went to see if Trump had connections with the hydroxychloroquine manufacturers. They found out he <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://noticias.uol.com.br/internacional/ultimas-noticias/2020/04/07/defensor-da-cloroquina-trump-tem-participacao-em-fabricante-do-medicamento.htm" target="_blank">had it</a>.</p> <p>Thus a narrative began to be put together.</p> <h2>Piece 5: US scientists call for calm</h2> <p>Didier Raoult’s study was preliminary. The focus was, at that time, on the six patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin who had an abrupt viral reduction. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/internacional-52239163" target="_blank">Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, physician and leader of the coronavirus task force in the USA, took the lead. He asked for prudence.</p> <p>Today, any reasonably well-informed person knows what a complete and impeccable scientific study is, the so-called “gold standard of science”: it is randomized, controlled, double-blind, peer-reviewed and published in a prestigious scientific journal. It was Fauci’s class.</p> <h2>Piece 6: Bolsonaro, the puppet and Trump fan, repeated the solution</h2> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_rPC59vnFXyHE5IwmEYHU5g.jpeg" alt="trump cartoon" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_rPC59vnFXyHE5IwmEYHU5g.jpeg 364w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_rPC59vnFXyHE5IwmEYHU5g-213x300.jpeg 213w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px"></figure> <p>Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politic, is a longing for the Brazilian dictatorship (1964–1985).</p> <p>He tends to praise torturers of that time, who in addition to being rapists, stuffed live rats into the vaginas of college students. Bolsonaro, behaving like a psychopath, praises these torturers laughing and having fun.</p> <p>This political aberration was only elected president of the republic due to a fraudulent election that took place in 2018, where the leader of the polls, Lula da Silva, ex-unionist, ex-president, patriot and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.rfi.fr/br/geral/20110926-lula-recebe-em-paris-titulo-honoris-causa-da-universidade-sciences-po" target="_blank">revered worldwide</a>, center-left, was arrested in a process <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-car-wash-prosecutors-workers-party-lula/" target="_blank">fraudulent</a>, just so it doesn’t compete.</p> <p>Lula led the polls even when arrested. The UN even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-lula/brazils-lula-should-have-political-rights-u-n-human-rights-committee-idUSKBN1L21L1" target="_blank">demanded that he be allowed</a> to run and that he have a fair trial. The Brazilian judicial system, behaving like that of a banana republic, ignored the order, even though the country was a signatory to international agreements related to human rights.</p> <p>This election, in addition to repeating in Brazil the same <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX8GxLP1FHo" target="_blank">fake news techniques</a> used in the U.S., which favored Trump’s election, came just two years after a coup in the country. This coup removed Dilma Roussef, from Lula’s party, from the presidency, and was also supported by our class-based judicial system.</p> <p>The story of this coup was spectacularly portrayed by filmmaker Petra Costa in his documentary “The Edge of Democracy”, an Oscar 2020 finalist and available on Netflix.</p> <figure><p> <iframe title="The Edge of Democracy | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLe24M_PB5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p>Soon it was proven that in this coup, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Brazilian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#US_involvement" target="_blank">as well as the previous one, of 1964</a>, there was the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/12/united-states-justice-department-brazil-car-wash-lava-jato-international-treaty/" target="_blank">participation of the USA</a>. This is traditional and normal in all coups d’état in the history of Latin America. If there was no participation from them, it would be something new. And these are scams always aimed at putting US puppets in power, friendly to North American <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4p6MvwpUeo" target="_blank">economic interests</a>.</p> <p>In addition, this coup was quite predictable that it would occur, after all, Brazil was the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://recordtv.r7.com/jornal-da-record/videos/brasil-foi-o-pais-que-mais-descobriu-reservas-de-petroleo-na-ultima-decada-06102018#:~:text=Brasil%20foi%20o%20pa%C3%ADs%20que,RecordTV%20%2D%20R7%20Jornal%20da%20Record" target="_blank">country in the globe that discovered the most oil</a> in the last decade. Natural resource that always generates US greed.</p> <p>And this deliveryist and fascist government, in addition to having members who <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/world/americas/roberto-alvim-brazil.html" target="_blank">copy speeches</a> by Josef Goebbels, Adolf Hitler’s propaganda minister, has a long history of attacking Brazilian science, aiming to weaken the nation as a whole.</p> <p>The government guru, a self-styled philosopher astrologer, Olavo de Carvalho, admired by Bolsonaro, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/olavo-de-carvalho-nao-ha-nada-que-refute-que-a-terra-e-plana" target="_blank">believes</a> that the earth is flat and that the coronavirus epidemic <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.poder360.com.br/coronavirus/essa-epidemia-simplesmente-nao-existe-diz-olavo-de-carvalho/" target="_blank">does not exist</a>.</p> <p>It does not stop there. This government appoints, for scientific positions, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2020/01/28/novo-presidente-da-capes-gera-polemica-ao-defender-criacionismo.ghtml" target="_blank">defenders of creationism</a>. Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo, whose father was part of the government of the previous dictatorship and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/02/procurador-geral-pai-do-chanceler-ernesto-araujo-dificultou-extradicao-de-nazista.shtml" target="_blank">made it difficult to extradite</a> Nazi fugitives from Germany, and Araújo believes that global warming is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.hypeness.com.br/2018/11/ministro-de-relacoes-exteriores-diz-que-aquecimento-global-e-trama-marxista/" target="_blank">Marxist plot</a>.</p> <p>This minister, on course for diplomats, proposes possibilities for alien invasions of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://revistaforum.com.br/politica/bolsonaro/em-curso-de-diplomatas-itamaraty-pergunta-como-proceder-em-invasao-de-aliens-de-beta-centauri/" target="_blank">alpha centauri</a>.</p> <p>It is an anti-science government.

When I saw Trump announcing the Didier Raoult study, I had a positive bias and concluded that the study was really good. “For the first time in his life, this idiot listens to a renowned scientist”, I thought.</p> <p>The same occurred when Bolsonaro parroted Trump. “Even a stopped clock shows the hour twice a day”, I reflected.</p> <p>But yes, Didier Raout is unlucky. <strong>He had the two worst allies in the world.</strong></p> <p>Whoever was going to bars, parties and was not quarantined, and learned of the hydroxychloroquine studies from the mouth of Trump or Bolsonaro, along with Fauci’s explanations, automatically disavowed.</p> <p>After all, from these mouths, the normal thing is to come shit.</p> <h2>Piece 8: Didier Raoult is attacked</h2> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_bLUDSLfbyfBAwT1Gy6Uq3Q.jpeg" alt="didier raoult" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_bLUDSLfbyfBAwT1Gy6Uq3Q.jpeg 683w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_bLUDSLfbyfBAwT1Gy6Uq3Q-200x300.jpeg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"></figure> <p>In addition to explanations of side effects, and strong criticism for not being the “gold standard” of drug studies, extremely negative articles began to appear for Didier Raoult’s reputation.</p> <p>The “For Better Science” website made one of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forbetterscience.com/2020/03/26/chloroquine-genius-didier-raoult-to-save-the-world-from-covid-19/" target="_blank">most viral</a>. There began a massive smear campaign. "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forbetterscience.com/2020/04/22/chloroquine-witchdoctor-didier-raoult-barking-mad-and-dangerous/" target="_blank">Wizard Doctor</a>" was one of the titles. It was quickly translated into Portuguese and was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jornalggn.com.br/a-grande-crise/genio-ou-embusteiro-o-cientista-que-difundiu-a-cloroquina/" target="_blank">published</a> on the Nassif website, with great repercussion.</p> <p>The texts addressed several things, but one caught my attention: a history of fraud in scientific studies signed by Didier.</p> <p>They found at least four studies with microscope images altered by photoshop. But the total number of studies, almost 3 thousand, did not speak.</p> <p>In addition, charges with expensive themes on the left, such as sexual harassment, bullying with students, pressure and overtime. The article contained the testimony of hurt people who broke with the infectologist.</p> <p>The harassment was not Didier’s, but that he would have covered up occurrences at the institute where he runs.</p> <p>In addition to the altered studies, already proven, the rest, probably, everything must be true. At least it’s credible. Didier accuses one of his students for the alterations in the images. I believe that under the pressure of being one of the most productive institutes in the world, a student’s attitude in this regard may be quite possible.</p> <p>About harassment, Didier gave the worst possible answer, at the time, to the press: "Thank you for describing this place as a brothel, I will install a condom machine".</p> <p>However, I believe that such a scrutiny, absolutely no one is left unscathed. But for those who received the news by Trump and Bolsonaro, the "farcical" label stuck to Didier with ease, as an effect of the negative confirmation bias.</p> <p>I still hoped that there was a result and went to find out about the institute’s website and its twitter. With such heavy articles, if Didier did not speak up, his study would be proven to be a fraud.</p> <p>In his responses, Didier Raoult made a basic communication error. On the institute’s youtube channel, instead of being at the center of a table, with several researchers, after all, the study was signed by several scientists, he appeared alone. He was unable to show support for his team.</p> <p>But I started to pay attention. In one of the interviews, in relation to the strong side effects, he stated that he would give the drugs to his own mother. About not being randomized, he made an analogy about the parachute. He said that it is not necessary to throw 20 people out of an airplane, ten with parachutes and ten without, to conclude that ten people would die.</p> <p>The explanations made sense to me, after all, in Europe, the average death rate among those infected was approximately 15% of patients.</p> <p>And a curiosity: the articles in “For Better Science” appeared on Google, before Didier’s page on Wikipedia.</p> <h2>Piece 9: "Miracle cure".

"It shocked scientists around the world", they evaluated. In addition, they called what he proposed "miracle cure". They heard other experts about his reputation and made a political connection to Trump.</p> <p>A few days later, a US doctor, James Todaro, comments on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/jamestodaromd/status/1260218244247543810" target="_blank">his twitter:</a></p> <figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1208/0*kIJgyptonJNwe6OX.png" alt="Image for post"></figure> <h2>And when would confirmation come or not?</h2> <p>The evolution of COVID-19 is well documented. It is not similar to AIDS, where the patient can die in six months or 20 years.</p> <p>The vast majority of people incubate the virus for six days. Soon afterwards, he presents symptoms, and in another week or 10 days, about 5% of symptomatic patients become severe (the number varies slightly). Of the serious ones, intubated, about half die.</p> <p>Now think with me. Let’s go to a very basic logic.</p> <p>You stay in a pandemic focal point, give the medicine to 100 people who already have symptoms, if in 15 days, out of the total, only one or two need to be intubated, the medicine works and we have proof.</p> <p>It’s simple. You don’t even have to wait to see if the intubates died, right?</p> <p>It does not need a control group, peer review, double blind, or publication in a reputable magazine.</p> <p>You just need to correctly count the number of intubated patients.</p> <p>Therefore, it was only a matter of two more weeks and the treatment would be confirmed or not. Someone would.</p> <p>Quite logical. Does anyone have any questions?</p> <h2>Piece 10: "Miracle cure".

He claimed, a few days later, that he had already treated some people with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, Didier’s protocol. And he added one more item to the cocktail: zinc.</p> <p>And he took an important step: he released his treatment protocol in a letter to doctors.</p> <figure><div>  </div></figure> <p>The New York Times story on his story stated that he was not seeing patients personally, but with a team.</p> <p>Due to a recent cancer, Zelenko has only one lung. He’s a risk group for Covid-19. Prudent, he remained in his home, isolated.</p> <p>The article in the newspaper, in addition to photographing him outside a hospital environment, without being in white, unintentionally collaborating with semiotics, developed a political narrative. Zelenko is a supporter of Trump. "The country’s simple doctor becomes a star on the right", said the newspaper.</p> <p>In addition, they found memes on their facebook attacking Hillary Clinton, a Democratic candidate in the last presidential election. "Zelenko’s treatment reached a useful moment for Trump and his media supporters, who at times seemed more interested in discussing miracle cures than talking about delays or a shortage of fans", he said.</p> <p>He spoke some numbers. At the end of March, it had already treated 200 patients, with only six hospitalized, two intubated and zero deaths. His treatment was precocious, before the disease worsened, repeating Raoult. Their numbers, compared to the death rate among infected Americans, were encouraging.</p> <p>However, numbers like this, presented, are not reliable. It is an "anecdotal case". It is a doctor speaking who treated patients. And in his case, at home.</p> <p>Scientists explained that anecdotal cases are worthless. I agreed. The argument is a good one. After all, if the patient dies, it is another doctor who signs the death certificate.</p> <p>It served a little for me, who was trying to believe, as a positive confirmation bias, that it worked.</p> <p>For those who had the golden rule of science in mind, the randomized, controlled, double blind, the confirmation bias remained "not scientifically proven", with good reason.</p> <p>But it raised a question to me: would he lie about the dead for being a Trump fanatic, to help him?</p> <p>It could be. The article addressed a strong religiosity of Zelenko, an item always related to far right-wing politicians, such as Trump.</p> <p>Could it be that Didier Raoult was completely crazy, was destroying a brilliant career with a gigantic lie and that Zelenko went into the same hallucination?</p> <p>Yes, it was a possibility.</p> <p>It is not uncommon for men to do giant shit out of a passion, for example.</p> <p>I needed, then, a confirmation with more credibility: a hospital applying this. But a situation in which the same doctors who prescribe the drugs sign death certificates if the patient dies.</p> <p>I think people can actually make up stories of healing for fame or political fanaticism, but everything has a limit.</p> <p>Falsifying death certificates gives jail in any minimally civilized country.</p> <h2>Piece 11: "chloroquine can be even more dangerous than the virus itself"</h2> <p>What started out as a self-medication alert soon became a big, menacing monster.</p> <p>One of the channels that I usually follow on Brazilian YouTube is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdGpd0gNn38UKwoncZd9rmA" target="_blank">Pirula</a>. I’ve known him for many years. Pirula is a scientist, paleontologist, and makes videos on various topics.</p> <p>He “translates” science into a language accessible to everyone. His predilection is for nerdy subjects, like dinosaurs, but he has already made great contributions to the Brazilian political debate, such as when he dismantled the creationist theory, which always tries to invade the public debate.</p> <p>Charismatic, he is one of the most influential scientific disseminators in South America. Each of his videos has over 100 thousand views.</p> <p>One of his most prominent videos was when he decided to fight the government guru, Olavo de Carvalho, intellectual mentor of Jair Bolsonaro, who in yet another common day of mental disorder, said that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QShqmm1uKU" target="_blank">Pepsi made sweeteners</a> with aborted fetuses.</p> <p>And Pirula, influenced by the media and following the thinking of the herd, produced a video “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2cIUFqNQuA" target="_blank">Chloroquine what we know</a>".</p> <p>His opinions are a reflection of the entire Brazilian scientific class. It is sensationalist and with a level of study shamefully primary for anyone who proposes to explain something scientific.</p> <p>However, listening to reports from people who take this medicine on a daily basis, I started a research.

A famous case in Brazil: phosphoethanolamine. It was "the cancer pill". Other scientific disseminators were in the same direction.</p> <p>It was a interesting case. A few years ago, a chemistry professor claimed to have discovered a cure for cancer. Of all kinds. This became a national discussion. Unicamp, a prestigious Brazilian university, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/index.php/ju/noticias/2018/04/03/fosfoetanolamina-de-pilula-do-cancer-caso-de-policia" target="_blank">released an editorial</a> saying it should be a police case.</p> <p>It is a coincidence to reinforce the negative confirmation bias.

There they treated patients.</p> <h2>Piece 17: the first study confirms hydroxychloroquine</h2> <p>April 10</p> <p>It was from China. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v3" target="_blank">62 patients were treated</a> at Renmin Hospital in Wuhan. The treatment was 5 days with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg) and without azithromycin.</p> <p>It was a randomized study. The four patients who progressed to severe pneumonia were in the control group.</p> <p>Being a controlled, randomized study, coming from communist China, I concluded that it was the end of the drug’s politicization. It would no longer be a flag of the far-right. And I thought that the criticisms for "carelessness", would now be resolved, because this is randomized.</p> <p>But it didn’t come out in the mainstream media. I was wrong.</p> <h2>Piece 18: Didier Raout decides to hit the stick on the table</h2> <p>11th of April</p> <p>The tension grew, the narrative of "quack" did not reduce, neither in the mainstream media, nor among scientists, and Professor Didier Raout took an important step to explain to the world that his treatment worked.</p> <p>He <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/covid-19/" target="_blank">started to publish, on his institute’s website</a>, the daily count of patients treated with his combination of drugs and how many died.</p> <p>There was an observation: they were patients who did not arrive serious enough and that the doctors were able to apply the medications for at least three days.</p> <p>Since the beginning, the dead have always remained in approximately 0.5% of the treaties.</p> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_JAT-qEx9Icb32inNPaU0xg.jpg" alt="infection rates" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_JAT-qEx9Icb32inNPaU0xg.jpg 311w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_JAT-qEx9Icb32inNPaU0xg-270x300.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px"></figure> <p>Publishing daily was an important attitude to guarantee the veracity of the data. With that, Didier eliminated suspicions of being a "fraudster" the label stuck on it globally.</p> <p>It has an exaggeratedly simple logic, but in the midst of this widespread madness, I find myself in need of explaining, in detail, as if I were talking to mad children, not adults, scientists and doctors.</p> <p>Follow the analysis with me.</p> <p>With these great numbers in the air, it was enough to wait 15 days and we would have a confirmation if the treatment worked or not.</p> <p>The options are as follows: either we would have a rebellion of subordinates with massive layoffs, or they would all be completely delusional, following a crazy leader, and would all be arrested soon.</p> <p>People even take the risk of being arrested when there is a lot of money involved. But hydroxychloroquine is a generic drug, which costs less than $ 10 per patient, in addition to being manufactured by hundreds of laboratories worldwide, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.france24.com/en/eye-on-africa/20200410-coronavirus-pandemic-tunisia-begins-manufacturing-hydroxychloroquine" target="_blank">including in Africa.</a> There is no such thing as a bribery center for scientists. You can’t match everyone.</p> <p>Think with me.</p> <p>Just put yourself in the position of a doctor working at IHU-Marseille:</p> <p>I am a doctor, I work with Didier, I will change death certificates, which is a crime in any minimally civilized country, at the risk of being arrested, losing my medical degree, just so that my boss appears on magazine covers? No, fuck!</p> <p>Changing a microscope image in photoshop is one thing, pretending that no people died in your hospital, altering death certificates or creating an underground cemetery to spawn corpses, making good numbers, is another thing.</p> <p>It is only possible to believe that these numbers are false if you can imagine this possible dialogue, between two doctors in Marseille, as credible:</p> <p>"What did he die of?"<br>"Run over by a bus."</p> <p>"And this one?"<br>"Bicycle accident. He was without a helmet."</p> <p>"Good idea. And this other one?"<br>"Slipped in the bathroom."</p> <p>"What about those other five?"<br>"Disappear them, otherwise the people will start to suspect."</p> <p>There’s no logic.</p> <h2>Piece 19: another success story, but the politicization of the medicine has increased</h2> <p>April 10</p> <p>Robin Armstrong, medical director of an asylum in Texas, USA, when finding that a large part of the inmates were contaminated with the coronavirus, prescribed hydroxychloroquine for his patients.</p> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_zbPVyQLXiADbtyTGzNpxAw-1024x550.jpg" alt="robin armstrong medical director" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_zbPVyQLXiADbtyTGzNpxAw-1024x550.jpg 1024w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_zbPVyQLXiADbtyTGzNpxAw-300x161.jpg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_zbPVyQLXiADbtyTGzNpxAw-768x413.jpg 768w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_zbPVyQLXiADbtyTGzNpxAw.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure> <p>In the title of the NPR story, which covered the case, the application was "disconcerting".</p> <p>Robin said the drugs were safe. "Contrary to Armstrong’s claim that hydroxychloroquine has virtually no side effects, the drug is known to have serious negative health impacts", <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/10/830348837/covid-19-patients-given-unproven-drug-in-texas-nursing-home-garnering-criticism" target="_blank">the text warned</a>.</p> <p>Now for a comparison:</p> <p>Washington (Kirkland) nursing home: no hydroxychloroquine, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-nursing-home-35-coronavirus-deaths-inside-the-kirkland-disaster-11584982494" target="_blank">35 deaths in 120 residents.</a></p> <p>Texas nursing home: hydroxychloroquine treatment, 1 death in 135 residents.</p> <p>Among patients and staff, Robin found 87 positive cases. Among the elderly, 38 were positive. One death is 2.6%.</p> <p>The average fatality rate among those infected in nursing homes in the USA is 27%.</p> <p>Politicizing the issue, they soon discovered that the doctor had <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/republican-doctor-trump-unproven-medicine-elderly-coronavirus-patients-982337/" target="_blank">ties</a> to Trump’s Republican party.</p> <p>The low mortality rate did not please. On a website that aims to discuss ethics in medical research, they asked if Robin Armstrong was committing an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bioedge.org/bioethics/is-a-texas-nursing-home-doctor-abusing-human-rights/13409" target="_blank">abuse of human rights</a>. In the main newspaper in Houston, the state capital, an editorial accused the doctor of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-How-far-is-too-far-in-coronavirus-15203644.php" target="_blank">crossing the ethical line</a>.</p> <p>Doctors in Kikland did not cross the ethical line or abuse human rights. With 35 deaths, they were impeccable in good medicine. Robin Armstrong, reducing deaths by 90%, no. He did everything wrong.</p> <p>"This is really disconcerting" said medicinal chemist Katherine Seley-Radtke, of applying the drugs.</p> <p>US officials soon brought the matter to justice. They called for a ban on "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wtae.com/article/class-action-lawsuit-beaver-county-nursing-home-experimental-drug-study-coronavirus-patients-hydroxychloroquine/32302324" target="_blank">medical experiments" with the elderly</a>, to keep the death rate at 27%.</p> <p>And a coincidence: Seley-Radke, president-elect of the International Society for Antiviral Research, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://magazine.umbc.edu/remdesivir-explained-what-makes-this-drug-work-against-viruses/" target="_blank">was</a> once a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://magazine.umbc.edu/remdesivir-explained-what-makes-this-drug-work-against-viruses/" target="_blank">consultant to Gilead.</a></p> <p>I also find it disconcerting.</p> <h2>Piece 20: a study came out that I was eager to see, the case of Prevent Senior, in São Paulo</h2> <p>April 18</p> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_nzBMKYfFr0JniIhdBWMb5w-683x1024.jpeg" alt="prevent senior health insurance provider" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_nzBMKYfFr0JniIhdBWMb5w-683x1024.jpeg 683w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_nzBMKYfFr0JniIhdBWMb5w-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_nzBMKYfFr0JniIhdBWMb5w.jpeg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"></figure> <p>A few days after the announcement of Didier Raoult’s study, Prevent Senior, a health insurance provider in São Paulo, announced that it already had the drugs and would apply the Marseille protocol to its patients.</p> <p>They also announced that they would produce a scientific article to disseminate the results.</p> <p>I was excited to know. It would be the ideal place to have confirmation. Unlike Zelenko, in New York, and Robin Armstrong in Texas, who could be lying out of political passion, without too many consequences, there would not be an anecdotal case, after all, with patients dying, they would have to sign the death certificates themselves.</p> <p>I had never heard of Prevent. I knew exactly during the pandemic, from the announcement of the treatment and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://noticias.uol.com.br/saude/ultimas-noticias/redacao/2020/03/31/mandetta-critica-estrutura-de-hospital-de-idosos-que-concentra-mortes-em-sp.htm" target="_blank">from criticism from Mandetta</a>, the Minister of Health at the time.</p> <p>At a certain point, at the beginning of COVID-19 in Brazil, Prevent Senior concentrated 60% of deaths in São Paulo, due to its health plan focusing on the elderly, over 60 years old, the main group of disease risk.</p> <p>And it is a giant company. They have a portfolio of 470 thousand customers. It is 25% of the elderly in São Paulo. They are the owners of several hospitals and had become a case in universities around the world for being able to make a health plan cheaper than conventional ones, precisely for the elderly.</p> <p>The secret, they say, is the use of technology, tele-attendance and speed for exams and medical procedures, not letting customers get serious, and costly, to start the treatments.</p> <p>One of the first reports from there said that the operator’s owners’ own mother had received the treatment, generating confidence and frightening the speech of fatal side effects.</p> <p>Before publishing, the doctors were already giving interviews, where they could not talk about the results, but the smile on their faces, and the spirits, were undeniable.</p> <p><strong>When it came out, the</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5qm58cd4fneeci2/2020.04.15%20journal%20manuscript%20final.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"><strong>study</strong></a><strong> had this graph:</strong></p> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_vJMStb-dQJNkmWlapDHNEw.jpg" alt="need for hospitalization chart hydroxychloroquine" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_vJMStb-dQJNkmWlapDHNEw.jpg 680w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_vJMStb-dQJNkmWlapDHNEw-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"></figure> <p>The end result was how many of the patients needed to be admitted and how many did not.</p> <p>For patients who gave the drugs less than 7 days after the first symptoms, only 1.17% needed to be hospitalized. For those who were medicated after a week of symptoms 3.2%, and for those who did not want to receive treatment, 5.5% needed to be hospitalized. Very good proof of the effectiveness of the treatment.</p> <p>At the time, there was already mass collective hysteria about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theintercept.com/2020/04/06/drug-treatment-trump-talks-covid-can-fatal-side-effect-cardiologists-warn/" target="_blank">fatal dangers of</a> hydroxychloroquine, and part of the clients, fearful, did not accept the medication. They became a control group.</p> <p>They had an interesting method. As there were not many tests in Brazil, neither in the public nor in the private network, and due to the low reliability in relation to false negatives, which occur in 33% of the cases, according to the scientists, the diagnosis was made by clinical analysis. A good part due to lung exams and the other part only due to symptoms.</p> <p>Prudent, to avoid contamination of more people, many clinical examinations were by video conference. Motorcycle courier services delivered medications to patients’ homes.</p> <h2>Piece 21: Criticism of the Prevent Senior study is a conspiracy theory</h2> <p>Natalia Pasternak, a scientist who has gained notoriety and fame during the pandemic, with several interviews with the largest media in Brazil, and Carlos Orsi, an experienced journalist in the science field, with passages in major newsrooms, such as that of the newspaper O Estado de S Paulo, published an opinion article on the website of the Instituto Questão de Ciência, an entity with a noble objective: the defense of the use of scientific evidence in public policies.</p> <p>The article entitled "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.revistaquestaodeciencia.com.br/questao-de-fato/2020/04/18/uma-aula-de-como-nao-se-deve-testar-um-medicamento" target="_blank">A class on how not to test a drug</a>" went viral on the internet. In addition to criticizing the lack of coronavirus testing in patients, when Brazil had very few virus detection tests, and repeating Anthony Fauci’s class on randomized, controlled, double-blind, peer-reviewed and published in major scientific journals, The authors followed, after talking about the dangers of medicines, to a surprising conclusion: “It seems to have been a disastrous marketing operation”, they wrote, before giving several other examples of marketing influencing scientific research. The article said that nothing was proven.</p> <p>Soon after, in one of the most influential newspapers in the country, the headline announced about the study: "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/estudo-da-prevent-senior-com-cloroquina-nao-tinha-autorizacao-governo-ve-indicios-de-fraude.shtml" target="_blank">Government sees evidence of fraud</a>". Interested, I ran to read. “Did the guys really go crazy and make up numbers?”, I thought to myself.</p> <p>Fraud? I was wondering if people died or not died and they were bureaucratic questions: time to start and finish the research, authorizations, papers and stamps. Soon after, the study was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.metropoles.com/saude/cloroquina-comissao-etica-suspende-estudo-da-prevent-senior" target="_blank">suspended in the</a> ethics <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.metropoles.com/saude/cloroquina-comissao-etica-suspende-estudo-da-prevent-senior" target="_blank">committee</a> for the same reasons.</p> <p>Come on. Think with me.</p> <p>And again, in an extremely basic and illustrative logic.</p> <p>Promote a "miracle cure" by marketing?</p> <p>For the medicine not to be working and this study to be just a marketing plan, it needs to produce a conspiracy theory to leave Olavo de Carvalho, the guru, feeling at a children’s buffet.</p> <p>We need to find credible a Prevent Senior director, arriving at a meeting, and saying:</p> <div><p>- I had an idea. We will pretend that no people die in our hospitals to promote a false cure for marketing.<br>- Interesting, and how will this happen?<br>- I bought a backhoe and we’re going to make a clandestine cemetery behind the hospital. With about 1000 corpses gone, we make an account that few people die here, and that we have drugs that work.<br>- What a great idea, boss. I’m in!<br>- Good, isn’t it? If everything goes well, we will increase our revenue a little. But folks, this can’t leak at all, because otherwise, in addition to us losing all of our fortune and our $ 100 million profit a year, we will all go to jail.<br>- I will go there to arrange with doctors, nurses, attendants and cleaning staff. Sure everyone is up for it.</p></div> <p>In the health operator, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=122&amp;v=Y-QVChrfCUs&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank">60% of the people</a> in the greater São Paulo died, at the beginning of the pandemic, between March and April. And no scientist has said it has peaked to this day.</p> <p>The normal, within the tragedy, in a place that only serves old people, was to have a motorcade of hearses or trucks at the door. Everyone remembers the famous photo in Italy, which went viral worldwide.</p> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_4GxafAtDUTJFep_lOMpigA-1024x576.jpeg" alt="military vehicles" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_4GxafAtDUTJFep_lOMpigA-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_4GxafAtDUTJFep_lOMpigA-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_4GxafAtDUTJFep_lOMpigA-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_4GxafAtDUTJFep_lOMpigA.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure> <p>With this image, which everyone has seen, you don’t have to make crazy marketing plans involving hiding corpses. For scenes like this, you already have a speech on the tip of your tongue: "Unfortunately, we suffered the same tragedy that occurred in Italy, our patients are in the group most at risk". Ready. The problem is solved.</p> <p>And more: for the theory, that it is just a marketing plan, to make sense, you would need to agree with the families of the dead to keep quiet, you need to buy the press so they don’t publish, you need to prohibit employees from taking photos, you need to steal the cameras of photographers on the streets near the hospitals, in addition to putting together a good plan to assassinate doctors who possibly resign for fear of being arrested, among several other repression actions. A level of control is needed that would make Kim Jong-un so red with envy.</p> <p>Does not make sense.</p> <h2>Piece 22: two simultaneous Jim Jones do not fit the puzzle</h2> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_lHKmTgqWTeSLoP-lFp7xiA-1024x681.jpeg" alt="jim jones" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_lHKmTgqWTeSLoP-lFp7xiA-1024x681.jpeg 1024w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_lHKmTgqWTeSLoP-lFp7xiA-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_lHKmTgqWTeSLoP-lFp7xiA-768x511.jpeg 768w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_lHKmTgqWTeSLoP-lFp7xiA.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure> <p>This guy in the picture is Jim Jones. He created and was the leader of a sect and had fanatical followers. Disturbed, in November 1978, he induced 900 people to collective suicide in Jonestown, a city he created in Guyana to shelter his followers, who left their lives behind, to follow him.</p> <p>I even accept the official narrative that Didier Raoult is a new Jim Jones in Marseille and is leading 800 subordinates, of religious allegiance, to collective suicide, where everyone takes the risk of being arrested, losing their medical degrees, and ending their lives in French prisons, doing everything to defend their charismatic leader.</p> <p>I also accept the narrative that both Zelenko and Robin Armstrong have been lying about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine because they are right-wing fascist fanatics, supporters of Donald Trump.</p> <p>I also accept that the second paper, coming from China, out of corporatism, Chinese doctors rushed to defend the reputation of a French doctor.</p> <p>But when they try to tell me that a second Jim Jones emerged simultaneously in São Paulo, with the same “miracle cure”, but without having been the inventor of the treatment, and therefore without being emotionally attached to it, taking hundreds more doctors and employees, in a company that makes billions, not a university that was not made to make a profit, to their respective suicides, everything went beyond any reasonable limit.</p> <h2>Piece 23: the perverted panda bears and scientific fundamentalism</h2> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_990BAEqYsRHGYgckx_Lr1w-1024x682.jpeg" alt="panda bear" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_990BAEqYsRHGYgckx_Lr1w-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_990BAEqYsRHGYgckx_Lr1w-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_990BAEqYsRHGYgckx_Lr1w-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_990BAEqYsRHGYgckx_Lr1w.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure> <p>This animal in the photo is a panda bear. They all have a sad expression. They have been on the list of endangered animals for quite some time. In addition, they are famous for a terrifying detail, scientific consensus for a long time: they rarely have sex.</p> <p>That’s right. Yes, science has to study panda bears, their customs, and protect them, even if it involves invading their respective privacies, revealing to the world, on various TV programs, their terrible reputation as lovers.</p> <p>Now let’s imagine a hypothetical situation: a scientist arrives and publishes a pre-print paper, saying that he has a horny panda bear, and that every Saturday that bear takes a girlfriend home and spends the whole night having sex. According to this scientist, they only sleep after dawn and wake up, always exhausted, after noon.</p> <p>"You need to send me more evidence about your claim. You need to verify that they have sex", says the reviewer, before publishing. That’s right. Science needs proof. All procedures must be followed. You can’t believe it like that, directly.</p> <p>So a National Geographic reporter is sent to film, in secret, the alleged animal porn.</p> <p>However, if it is later proved that the researcher lied when he said that his panda bear is a pervert, there is no problem. In the review, you eliminate his work, don’t publish, and destroy your reputation as a panda scientist.</p> <p>The point is that this scientist is not going to be arrested for this lie.</p> <p>In the case of medical treatments, where the patient dies or does not die, the review is not by peers. It is a three-level review and much more demanding: it starts with the police investigator, then with the prosecutor, and the last review is that of the judge of law, whether or not he issues a preventive detention order.</p> <p>If in three months they did not discover a clandestine cemetery with bones of 1000 old people in São Paulo, nor another one in Marseille with 400 bodies.</p> <p>If there was no rebellion of doctors in São Paulo, nor another in Marseille.</p> <p>If they did not discover a gang of tampering with death certificates at Prevent Senior or Didier’s hospital, and no one is under arrest, the conclusion is different: the medicine worked.</p> <p>There are no more options. Or do we have to conclude that, in conspiracy theory, that both the São Paulo and Marseille judicial authorities were purchased by hydroxychloroquine manufacturers? Only a troubled mind can think that.</p> <p>I, who think more simply, concluded everything differently: what happened with Zelenko, with Robin, in China and at Prevent Senior, were scientific evidences.</p> <p>It is that old science class I had when I was a child: when you reproduce an experiment and have the same result, you have scientific proof.</p> <h2>Piece 24: how today’s scientists would react to Yuri Gagarin</h2> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_slzaVbeTBRTalEZlOIVv7Q-1024x484.jpg" alt="yuri gagarin" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_slzaVbeTBRTalEZlOIVv7Q-1024x484.jpg 1024w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_slzaVbeTBRTalEZlOIVv7Q-300x142.jpg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_slzaVbeTBRTalEZlOIVv7Q-768x363.jpg 768w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_slzaVbeTBRTalEZlOIVv7Q.jpg 1279w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure> <p>“The Earth is blue,” said Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961. The Soviet cosmonaut was the first man in outer space. A formidable scientific evolution.</p> <p>The phrase became famous. At the time, it appeared in all newspapers, TV and radio programs.</p> <p>"How nice, the earth is blue", comments a layman. "We cannot affirm this. It is not scientifically proven that the earth is blue", answers some scientist or scientific promoter.</p> <p>"Why not?" Asks the average person. "It’s just that you lay people don’t understand the scientific method. Until we do a complete color blindness test in Gagarin, controlled, randomized, double blind, and then peer-reviewed and published in an impact scientific journal, we cannot conclude that it is scientifically proven. In addition, it can be a lie. Many people lie", says the scientist.</p> <p>"But man, the probability of him lying in the color of the earth, or being colorblind, is minuscule, as is the possibility that both Didier Raoult and Prevent Senior are hiding corpses", says the layman.</p> <p>"To say that it is blue is to be a denialist of science. It is to believe for the will to believe. The earth can be red, blue or pink. The only way to have scientific proof is to do a controlled, randomized, double blind test, in each of Gagarin’s eyes, and that takes about a year.

The whole world already knows this.</p> <p>Technical explanations for the general public always occur at major events. When Gol’s Boeing 737 crashed into another plane in 2006 over the Amazon rainforest, killing all occupants of the aircraft, the entire country understood what a transponder and a TCAS was.</p> <p>The explanation of the RTC (Randomized controled trial) today is usually accompanied by a complaint of having to "explain the basics again". Some even dare to ask scientists around the world to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/MBittencourtMD/status/1279452766444957700" target="_blank">stop publishing</a> observational studies on hydroxychloroquine.</p> <p>However. It is ridiculous to ask, just in a pandemic, for level A of evidence. (Several RTC studies).</p> <p>If we ask for it, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6439920/" target="_blank">89% of the drugs used in cardiology</a>, which do not have evidence A, should also be banned. And consequently, the doctors who prescribe them, must be called "denialists".</p> <h2>Piece 55: sabotaged piece?</h2> <p>The World Health Organization also sponsored a study with hydroxychloroquine. It is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20151852v1" target="_blank">Recovery Trial of the University of Oxford</a>. It is a complete “gold standard” study.</p> <p>Professor Didier Raoult’s protocol was ignored. Only hydroxychloroquine and for very sick patients. The average was about 9 days after the symptoms, with 60% already needing oxygen. And 17% already need ventilation.</p> <p>While Didier claims 0.6% of deaths in his studies. In Oxford, 25% of the treatment group died.</p> <p>The dose was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/JamesTodaroMD/status/1272661099985481733" target="_blank">2400 mg</a> on the first day, four times higher than the French protocol. Then they continue to apply 800mg daily.</p> <p>I am not a specialist, I had already read the study by Fiocruz, in the Amazon, with a dose of 1200 mg. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2765499" target="_blank">There scientists already said</a> that this dose was too high and should not be used.</p> <p>In Recovery, they doubled the dose.</p> <p>The biggest study, the most complete one, and they didn’t read the Fiocruz study?</p> <p>It does it differently, with a toxic dose, says it doesn’t work and generates news for the world. And it was an unprecedented dose. No one has ever used this amount of hydroxychloroquine for any treatment of any disease.</p> <p>It may just be another coincidence. But I bet that today we have researchers, inside Fiocruz, suspicious and beginning to understand what is happening.</p> <h2>Piece 56: the geopolitical situation</h2> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_ApQpImKOF1Enao6zWhfSzw-1024x538.jpeg" alt="structure on fire" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_ApQpImKOF1Enao6zWhfSzw-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_ApQpImKOF1Enao6zWhfSzw-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_ApQpImKOF1Enao6zWhfSzw-768x403.jpeg 768w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_ApQpImKOF1Enao6zWhfSzw.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Police station in Mineapolis, after the death of George Floyd.</figcaption></figure> <p>Trump, speaking of Didier’s study, confronted American scientists. This messed with egos and created a reaction. At the same time, Gilead thought it had a card up its sleeve, confident of the success of Remdesivir, whose results were about to come out.</p> <p>Never doubt the communication power and influence of a $ 22 billion company. It is childish to doubt that.</p> <p>Hydroxychloroquine, cheap, without patents and without a large corporation behind it, has no bargaining power. The drug was attacked and disqualified.</p> <p>Big pharma’s trained monkeys are able to maintain the narrative that other drugs don’t work. But the script failed: the big pharmaceutical companies are failing to say that their profitable drugs works, despite huge marketing.</p> <p>In fact, in addition to not reducing deaths, Remdesivir has caused kidney failure and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220305282" target="_blank">left people on</a> dialysis <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220305282" target="_blank">machines</a>. And one more coincidence: I have not seen news in the mainstream media about the serious side effects of this medication.</p> <p>In the end, it is not a "scientific war", but narratives wars. And hydroxychloroquine will win.</p> <p>You cannot hold results data from other countries for long. Nor is it possible to ban countries from using them, despite attempts, such as the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-53310502" target="_blank">lobbying over Russia</a>, with its excellent numbers, which are already bothering.</p> <p>Soon the narrative that doesn’t work will crumble like a house of cards. It can’t be all coincidence.</p> <p>The problem is when it will happen.</p> <p>In a political context in the USA of fierce spirits, black lives matter, bugaloo boys, accelerators, and 100 million people with guns at home, this retreat needs to be very well planned.</p> <p>There will be an election this year in the USA. The chair of president worth a lot.</p> <p>In addition, Trump, with his fits in search of quick results, ignored Henry Kissinger’s "triangular diplomacy" strategy, which guaranteed US supremacy. Trump has implemented economic sanctions in both Russia and China at the same time. A stupid mistake.</p> <p>The two countries are now more friendly than ever. On the BRICS, Brazil and India have already fallen. Brazil with the 2016 coup, which removed independence from US and left the country a backyard in the USA, enforcing the Monroe doctrine, and India, with its traditional lack of self-esteem and eternal feeling of colony.</p> <p>Today it’s just RC. And China is coming with its formidable "new silk route", almost completed, to finish leveraging the whole of Asia. It is an existential threat to the USA.</p> <p>In this context, the "deep state", which is the unelected US government, the military industrial complex, the largest and richest lobby in the world, has arrived to help with the narrative that hydroxychlorouine does not work. The proportion was much higher.</p> <p>The deep state has only one objective: to overthrow Trump and save the empire. For that he needs to be the worst president in the world in leading the pandemic. Hydroxychloroquine would be your hit. Chaos, in the USA, overthrows president.</p> <p>Didier Raoult, fell in the middle of that boiling pot. He had a good perception. In his testimony at the French congress, he said that the United States was in a "civil war".</p> <p>This civil war comes from afar. The Russia Gate did not work. It had no evidence, despite years and years of trying.</p> <p>While Trump is lousy for his people, and stirring spirits within the U.S., he is good for the world. He did not create external wars, despite the fact that the “deep state” threw banana peels at him, as when he made Trump authorize the assassination of General Soleimani, previously an ally in the fight against the Islamic state, with false information.</p> <p>Iran reacted by launching missiles on US bases in Iraq. Trump did not continue to beat the drums of war.</p> <p>That is, Trump is, in some ways, really anti-system. He did it right. They would lose to Iran. In all simulated war drills there, none of the US wins. Imagine a pandemic and the Strait of Hormuz, where 80% of the world’s oil passes, closed, at the same time!</p> <p>Obama, with his good boy face, Nobel Peace Prize, and beautiful speeches, deceived us all. Nothing has changed. The Democratic party is the perfect portrait of the American establishment. Under his command, and with Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, we only saw capitalist, hybrid, real wars and colorful revolutions.</p> <p>Libya today is a haven for terrorist training and the slave trade. Syria resisted with the help of Russia.</p> <p>Brazil, Ukraine, and others: hybrid wars and colorful revolutions.</p> <p>In addition, under Obama’s command, more support for neoliberalism, increasing the social gap in the USA.</p> <p>Trump did not start external wars. The most he did was launch several Tomahawks into an empty airport in Syria, and much of it was intercepted by old-fashioned, but still efficient, Russian S-200 systems. It was just the most expensive pyrotechnic show in the world.</p> <p>And with Trump in power, more good news: even hybrid wars and colorful revolutions lose their effectiveness. He doesn’t know how to disguise. Chinese intelligence, understood at the time, everything that happens in Hong Kong and has already defused the bomb.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Democratic party, the left-wing cemetery in the U.S., was more afraid of Bernie Sanders than of Trump, and sabotaged him, both in the 2016 previews and now. They launched Biden, already almost senile.</p> <p>With Biden leading the pools, there is only one certainty: the official narrative about the scientific evidence for hydroxychloroquine cannot change.</p> <blockquote><p><em>“The purpose of the media is not to inform what happens, but to shape public opinion according to the will of the dominant corporate power”, Noam Chomsky</em></p></blockquote> <h2>Piece 57: the political situation in Brazil</h2> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_Rivir_ubeJqksNxc9zaHjw.jpeg" alt="Bolsonaro offers hydroxychloroquine to an emu" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_Rivir_ubeJqksNxc9zaHjw.jpeg 900w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_Rivir_ubeJqksNxc9zaHjw-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_Rivir_ubeJqksNxc9zaHjw-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure> <p>Bolsonaro only talks about hydroxychloroquine to deflect the subject.

It remains for him to attempt a coup to have more power. It is the only option to try to save yourself.</p> <p>But Bolsonaro is not a Trump. Its supporters are 15% quasi-religious fanatics. Trump brought numbers to the economy, being, in fact, anti-neoliberal. It has about 40% popularity.</p> <p>Here, with neoliberalism surrendering and subservient to US interests, Bolsonaro and Guedes, the economy minister, never brought good numbers. “It’s the economy, stupid", explained James Carville, Bill Clinton’s campaign marketer.</p> <p>Bolsonaro’s support comes only from believers based on proto-fascist reactionary hatred.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Brazilian and world left, traditionally quick to distrust the USA when reading any news about the Middle East, Venezuela, Bolivia, Russia and Petrobras, because they involve great financial interests in oil, due to its almost unprecedented nature, has not yet learned to distrust narratives that involve another highly profitable branch: the pharmacist.</p> <p>I saw left-wing commentators with heavy criticism of the US government’s “evil” when they <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pragmatismopolitico.com.br/2020/07/coronavirus-eua-compram-todo-estoque-mundial-de-remdesivir-dos-proximos-3-meses.html" target="_blank">bought almost all</a> of Remdesivir’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pragmatismopolitico.com.br/2020/07/coronavirus-eua-compram-todo-estoque-mundial-de-remdesivir-dos-proximos-3-meses.html" target="_blank">stock</a>. "They just think about them", one said. Let them have everything. This medicine is useless.</p> <p>And the worst is leftist scientists, the perfect discourse to please the big pharmaceutical industries: that a drug can only be applied with the “gold standard” test, which is very expensive and in practice only expensive drugs from the powerful pharmaceutical industries have.</p> <p>And RTC trials are no <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07853890.2018.1453233" target="_blank">guarantee of anything</a>.</p> <h2>Forecasts for the future</h2> <p>1 — Some scientist will one day study this as the biggest case of confirmation bias in history.</p> <p>2 — The most interesting of all, is that following this story, I saw that in science you cannot lie rudely. External influences can get in the way, and create narratives, but they are unmasked. The dose of the Oxford study, exposing the fragility of the experiment, and the two studies with false data, dropped instantly. Therefore, confirmation will come. The truth, it seems, in science, wins. It will be a consensus among scientists soon. It is too big a story to forget.</p> <p>3 — Science will be rethought. It will develop methods to protect itself from major financial and political interests.</p> <p>4 — The idiocy of the concept of "impact magazines" will be rethought. It makes no sense that publications in these magazines are synonymous of status and the only truth. Many scientists have to pay for their studies to be published in them.</p> <p>5 — Any change to the "official narrative" before the US elections will only occur if China and Russia decide that, for their geopolitical interests, Trump is better reelected. Alone, Trump has no ability to change it.</p> <p>6 — After the truth prevails, the guilt of the dead without treatment, broken companies, economic depression and millions of unemployed, will fall only on the big pharmaceutical companies. How many innocents!</p> <h2>My alerts</h2> <p><strong>To progressive scientists</strong> : this disease has a greater fatality among the poorest and blackest. The wealthy are taking in their private offices and pocket doctors. Without their support, the biggest victims will be exactly those that the left aims to protect. How will the speech be? The charge will be contempt for the most vulnerable.</p> <p>In addition, science is already attacked daily by this obscure government, imagine after the treatment is "scientifically confirmed". As if all this evidence was not scientific evidence.</p> <p>After all, who do you expect that confirmation to come from? Anthony Fauci? Does not the owner of Prevent Senior, who recently said that in his hospitals, in the first half of 2020, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://exame.com/negocios/kit-covid-prevent-senior-envia-hidroxicloroquina-para-casa-dos-pacientes/" target="_blank">fewer people died than in the first half of 2019</a>, even with the pandemic?</p> <p><strong>To conservative scientists:</strong> &nbsp;haven’t you noticed that Bolsonaro is being made of muggles, that politician that you defend with such commitment?

What will you do with your conscience after the death of a patient who ordered the drugs, you denied giving a class on your scientific ethics, and then came the "confirmation", even with all the evidence in front of you for a long time, which do you deny seeing them?</p> <h2>Why did I write this article?</h2> <p>I studied the subject to exhaustion. I was wondering if I should take these drugs if I get viruses. My decision is made: if I take COVID-19, I go after doctors to prescribe the Didier Raoult protocol. I will add zinc.</p> <p>I don’t believe in coincidences. I don’t want their opinion, I already have it. If the first refuses, I will warn you that I will go from office to office, spreading the virus, until I find a doctor who will write the prescription.</p> <p>The idea of writing is to explain everything I know to my friends and relatives, so that if they get it, they are not more afraid of the medication than of the disease.</p> <p>And I post it publicly because I want these drugs available in all health centers, as a real public policy, so that friends without money also have access.</p> <p>And I wrote for the sake of ethics. I leave the fake news with the far right. That label is theirs. I’m not going to be part of a cog that sends news that people can go blind if they take these drugs.</p> <p>I will not collaborate with fake news just because it is an idea defended by those I want to eliminate from politics. Before we saved people, then we resolved this collective imbecility that took over the government.</p> <p>Democracy in Brazil dies from time to time. The STF — Superior Federal Court, is in constant threat due to Bolsonarism, which aims to shield itself from investigations.

Only a few without brains participate in these protests. Now entities <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.jota.info/stf/do-supremo/cnts-e-fenafar-pedem-ao-stf-a-suspensao-da-cloroquina-no-tratamento-da-covid-19-04062020" target="_blank">activate the STF</a>, using "science", so that they stop the hydroxychloroquine.</p> <p>In the US, they need to maintain the narrative that the drug doesn’t work for just a few months. Maybe they can. Here, our next election will be in 2022.</p> <p>This STF is bad and washed his hands during the 2016 coup d’état. So they created little monsters. But it is what we have today to protect ourselves from authoritarianism. Without them, it would be worse.</p> <p>If the STF takes the action to stop the medication, and later "confirmation" of effectiveness will come, bolsonarismo will have an easy speech against the court. "The STF chose to kill people", they will say, with ease.</p> <p>It will not be just 200 or 300 people wanting to close the court. There will be thousands of zombies wanting to set the building on fire and hungry for the brains of judges. I do not wish to see neither the STF nor the scorned Brazilian science.</p> <p>Doubt: does this action also aim to stop 90% of cardiology medications that have never undergone an RTC (Randomized controled trial)?</p> <h2>If some idiot came this far and still thinks I’m a bolsonarista</h2> <p>I prove that I am not. Right after the coup d’état of 16, I made a film for the National Nanometer Festival. (up to 45 seconds). It was a political film. I denounced neoliberalism. This film was awarded. Then it was selected to be shown at festivals in France, Portugal and the USA. YouTube does not accept changing a file or publication date. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccLhmft2As" target="_blank">Watch here</a> and see the publication date.</p> <p>The following year, I did another one. The idea was to denounce Bolsonaro to the world. This was also selected for festivals in Europe and the USA.&nbsp; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6BaKsjyMa8" target="_blank">Watch it here</a>.</p> </span><br></p></div></div></div>
