<p>The plot goes like this.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-airpods-story"><a href="#a-little-airpods-story">A little AirPods story</a></h2>
<p>You are stoked to have received your fresh AirPods in your mail.</p>
<p>You use them regularly and have a pretty good experience.</p>
<p>One day though, after months of usage, you get a rattling noise in one of your AirPods.</p>
<p>You don't understand where the issue lies, since you never dropped them and you know you handled them with cure (since it's a <em>premium product</em>, not so sure about that..)</p>
<p>You become a detective, and comb through all 1000+ issues related to "AirPods rattling".</p>
<p>"There is a fix!" - simply return the faulty AirPod to Apple and get a replacement.</p>
<p>You put out 99$ (more or less) and get them refunded when your faulty pair returns to their facility.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="not-so-fast"><a href="#not-so-fast">Not so fast</a></h2>
<p>Now you say, "well that went smooth, a bit annoying but I have my functioning AirPods again".</p>
<p>Time passes and your AirPods seem to work well. A month goes by and you almost forgot about that annoying rattling sound.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>The rattling noise comes back and hits you, in the ear. Sucker punch style.</p>
<p>It's on the other AirPod though.</p>
<p>You think about your past replacement experience and really don't want to go through this another time.</p>
<p>But what do you do? You don't have many alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Except to learn from your mistakes</strong></p>
<h2 id="alls-well-that-ends-well"><a href="#alls-well-that-ends-well">All's well that ends well</a></h2>
<p>Nah. It's not "well".</p>
<p>You put out 250$ to have a "temporarily working" product that you regularly need to replace (one airpod at a time).</p>
<p>That's not ok, sorry Apple.</p>
