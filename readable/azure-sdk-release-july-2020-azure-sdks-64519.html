If a build or test fails, our alerting system immediately notifies our SDK engineering teams and partner Azure service teams. In this post, I’ll show how the Azure SDK Engineering Systems team scaled Azure DevOps notifications to alert the right people at the right time when our automation discovers an issue.</p><h3>That’s a lot of pipelines</h3><p>We generally create one pipeline per service/language combination to build and test code relating to that pipeline. This keeps our DevOps agent machine time focused more narrowly and enables engineers to iterate more quickly on changes. For example, there’s no need to build packages and run tests for Storage when you’re making changes to Key Vault.</p><p>Keeping this many pipelines organized requires a standard approach to how we create, name, configure, and trigger pipelines. When you can apply standards to the work, you can automate that work. We built automation that uses the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1" target="_blank">Azure DevOps API</a>. A small team of engineers can scale our Engineering Systems to meet the needs of an ever growing matrix of services and languages.</p><h3>Alert System Architecture</h3><p>The Engineering Systems team looks for existing tools to handle problems. Azure Pipelines includes an alerting system does most of the work for us. Rather than build our own alerting system, we automate configuring Azure DevOps notification groups.</p><p>Our alerting system makes use of the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/" target="_blank">GitHub CODEOWNERS file</a> that teams are already using to add reviewers to pull requests. These same owners are responsible for fixing code in the service SDK when a build or test fails. To route notifications, we need to do a few things:</p><ol><li>Get a list of pipelines with schedule triggers.</li><li>Create notification groups for each pipeline.</li><li>Subscribe the notificaiton groups to receive failure notifications.</li><li>Synchronize the code owners into the notification group.</li></ol><h4>Get a list of pipelines with schedule triggers</h4><p>We use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/concepts/dotnet-client-libraries?view=azure-devops" target="_blank">.NET client libraries for Azure DevOps and TFS</a> in our tools to simplify working with the Azure DevOps API.</p><p>The client library returns an enumerable list of definition types, and we use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries" target="_blank">LINQ</a> to filter the results to what we need. This example shows how to filter pipeline definitions based on the trigger type:</p><pre><code><span>using</span><span> </span><span>Microsoft</span><span>.</span><span>TeamFoundation</span><span>.</span><span>Build</span><span>.</span><span>WebApi</span><span>;</span><span>

</span><span>}</span></code></pre><h4>Create notification groups</h4><p>For each of the filtered pipelines, we create two groups or “Teams” in Azure DevOps. The <em>parent notification team</em> serves as the central point of contact. We can add add arbitrary members to the parent team, like project or Engineering System administrators, who want to know when a pipeline fails but don’t want to be a code owner on GitHub. The parent notification team is subscribed to alerts for its pipeline.</p><p>The <em>synchronized notification team</em> contains the contacts from the <code><span>CODEOWNERS</span></code> file and is a member of the <em>parent notification team</em>. When a GitHub alias is added or removed from the <code><span>CODEOWNERS</span></code> file for a given pipeline the corresponding contact is added or removed from the Synchronized Notification Team.</p><p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2020/06/nested-notification-groups.png" data-featherlight="image"> <img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2020/06/nested-notification-groups.png" alt="The synchronized notification team is a member of the parent notification team"> </a></p><p>We keep track of groups using YAML in the <code><span>Description</span></code> field of the pipeline. This removes the need to store data in another database. For example:</p><pre><code><span>pipelineId</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>123</span><span>
purpose</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>ParentNotificationTeam</span></code></pre><p>The <code><span>pipelineId</span></code> field gives the Azure DevOps pipeline numerical ID and the <code><span>purpose</span></code> can either be <code><span>ParentNotificationTeam</span></code> or <code><span>SynchronizedNotificationTeam</span></code>.</p><h4>Synchronize CODEOWNERS</h4><p>Here is a subset of the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/.github/CODEOWNERS" target="_blank">CODEOWNERS file</a> in the Azure SDK for .NET repo.</p><pre><code><span># Catch all</span><span>
</span><span>/</span><span>sdk</span><span>/</span><span>        </span><span>@AlexGhiondea</span><span>

</span><span># Core</span><span>
</span><span>/</span><span>sdk</span><span>/</span><span>core</span><span>/</span><span>        </span><span>@pakrym</span><span> </span><span>@KrzysztofCwalina</span><span>
</span><span>…</span><span>
</span><span># Service teams</span><span>

For example, if we added a service called Foo but did not have an entry in the <code><span>CODEOWNERS</span></code> file, <code><span>@AlexGhiondea</span></code> would still receive notifications for Foo pipeline failures.</p><p>Our pipeline definition YAML files exist at the level of the service (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/appconfiguration/ci.yml" target="_blank">/sdk/appconfiguration/ci.yml</a>) and match the path leading up to the .yml file (e.g. <code><span>/sdk/</span><span>appconfiguration</span><span>/</span></code>) against the service team folder for each pipeline definition.</p><p>We translate the GitHub aliases using a Microsoft database of employees who contribute on behalf of the company and synchronize those contacts into the synchronized notification team.</p><h3>Use our tools</h3><p>The notification creation tool is open source so you can use it to build your own notification strategy. It is designed to work with repositories that follow our repository layout and pipeline structure but can be modified and extended to work with other environments. You can find the code in <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/tree/master/tools/notification-configuration" target="_blank">out tools repository</a></p><p>If you are working outside of Microsoft you will need to adapt the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/blob/master/tools/notification-configuration/github-codeowner-subscriber/GitHubNameResolver.cs" target="_blank"><code><span>GitHubNameResolver</span></code></a> class to work with your own contact resolving strategy. The process may be as simple as getting the user’s email address from the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-user" target="_blank">GitHub User API</a>.</p><h3>Other things to try</h3><p>Some ideas we had when designing this project but have not implemented yet:</p><p><strong>Alert Microsoft Teams</strong> – The Azure SDK team makes considerable use of Microsoft Teams. Putting these alerts in a Teams channel could work better than email for the ways in which some teams work.</p><p><strong>Make use of error logs</strong> – Azure DevOps has a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/scripts/logging-commands?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=bash#logissue-log-an-error-or-warning" target="_blank">Logging Command</a> feature where a specifically formatted message sent to the console will generate an alert in Azure DevOps. These alerts are the only detail a developer will see in an email and a little more effort here can help a product engineer quickly make sense of the failure and save time on investigations:</p><p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2020/06/devops-email-error-messages.png" data-featherlight="image"> <img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2020/06/devops-email-error-messages.png" alt="An example of error message logs in an Azure DevOps failure email"> </a></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Using and enforcing consistent pipeline and repo layouts means that our Engineering System will scale smoothly to meet the needs of our product engineers. Small tools like this one can tune your system in ways that help your product teams stay focused on their goals.</p><h2>Working with us and giving feedback</h2><p>So far, the community has filed hundreds of issues against these new SDKs with feedback ranging from documentation issues to API surface area change requests to pointing out failure cases.
