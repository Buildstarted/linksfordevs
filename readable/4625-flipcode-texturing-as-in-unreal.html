You're in for a real treat today! A few weeks ago, I asked Tim Sweeney (the
man behind the Unreal technology) if he would be willing to share a bit of
his time to answer specific Unreal-related questions that come my way. Being
a great sport, he agreed.<p>Knowing how busy my schedule keeps me, I have to assume his schedule is
worse, so I promised not to swamp him with questions. This is my polite way
of letting you know that if I get an outpouring of Unreal questions, I'll
just hold some back.</p><p><b>Tim writes:</b></p><hr noshade="noshade"><span>Unreal's software renderer uses an ordered "texture coordinate space"
dither, which (at high enough resolution) looks almost like bilinear
filtering.<p>The idea is simple: at each pixel, offset your texture u,v coordinates based
on an ordered dither kernel (two 2x2 lookup tables, one each for U and V,
indexed by the screen location (X&amp;1),(Y&amp;1), prior to texel lookup.  My
dither kernel looks something like this:</p></span><center><div><table width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="12" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffff"><pre><span>
          (X&amp;1)==0        (X&amp;1==1)
         +---------------------------------
(Y&amp;1)==0 | u+=.25,v+=.00  u+=.50,v+=.75
(Y&amp;1)==1 | u+=.75,v+=.50  u+=.00,v+=.25
 </span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></center><p><b>Paul writes:</b></p><hr noshade="noshade">
To clarify this, consider a texel coordinate at [72.37, 100.22] and a screen
coordinate at [50, 31].<p>You start by finding the LSB (least significant bit) of your [X,Y] screen
coordinate. In this example, our coordinate is [50, 31]. If we AND each
number with 1, the result is [0, 1] (50&amp;1 = 0, 31&amp;1 = 1). This is our index
into the lookup tables. With this index being [0, 1], we find that the table
contains: "u+=.75,v+=.50".</p><p>Adding .75 to U and .50 to V, we get: [72.37, 100.22] + [0.75, 0.50] =
[73.12, 100.72]. As you can see, this causes us to grab a different texel
then the one we're currently on. As you move from pixel to pixel through the
screen, you'll find that the dither tables will alternate which texels are
chosen based on how far you are to the bottom-right corner of a texel.
