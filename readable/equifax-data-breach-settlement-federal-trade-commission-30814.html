<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>In September of 2017, Equifax announced a data breach that exposed the personal information of 147 million people. The company has agreed to a global settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and 50 U.S. states and territories. The settlement&nbsp;includes up to $425 million to help people affected by the data breach.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>The initial deadline to file a claim in the Equifax settlement was January 22, 2020. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>After January 22, 2020, you can still </span><a href="https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/file-a-claim"><span>file a claim</span><span aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a><span> for expenses <strong>you incur between </strong></span></span><strong>January 23, 2020, and January 22, 2024</strong><span><span><strong>,</strong> as a result of identity theft or fraud related to the breach, such as: </span></span></p>

</ul><p><span><span>You also can file a claim for the time you spent recovering from identity theft or fraud between January 23, 2020, and January 22, 2024. You can be compensated up to $25 per hour up to 20 hours. There are limited funds available so your claim may be reduced. </span></span></p>

<h3><a id="FAQ7" name="FAQ7"></a>3. I don’t want Equifax to have my data. What can I do?</h3>

<p>Equifax is one of three national credit bureaus. These companies collect information about your credit history, such as how many credit cards you have, how much money you owe, and how you pay your bills. Each company creates a credit report about you, and then sells this report to businesses who are deciding whether to give you credit. You cannot opt out of this data collection. However, you can <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports">review your credit report </a>for free and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs">freeze your credit</a>.</p>
