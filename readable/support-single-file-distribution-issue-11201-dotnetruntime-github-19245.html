          <p>You're asking great questions, but since this is still early in design, I don't have great answers yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out of interest, how does this initiative compare to CoreRT? They seem like similar efforts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There would likely be somewhat similar outcomes (a single file), but the design may have different performance characteristics or features that do/don't work. For example, a possible design could be to essentially concatenate all of the files in a .NET Core self-contained application into a single file. That's 10s of MB and might start more slowly, but on the other hand, it would allow the full capabilities of CoreCLR, including loading plugins, reflection emit and advanced diagnostics. CoreRT could be considered the other end of the spectrum -- it's single-digit MB and has a very fast startup time, but by not having a JIT, it can't load plugins or use reflection emit and build time is slower than most .NET devs are used to. It currently has a few other limitations that could get better over time, but might not be better by .NET Core 3.0 (possibly requiring annotations for reflection, missing some interop scenarios, limited diagnostics on Linux). There are also ideas somewhere between the two. If folks have tradeoffs they'd like to make/avoid, we'd be curious to hear about them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it related to 'possibly native user code', i.e. it this will still allow code to be JIT-compiled, not just AOT?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By "native user code," I meant that your app might have some C++ native code (either written by you or a 3rd-party component). There might be limits on what we can do with that code -- if it's compiled into a .dll, the only way to run it is off of disk; if it's a .lib, it might be possible to link it in, but that brings in other complications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, I assume that the runtime components ('Native code (runtime, host, native portions of the framework..') will be the ones from the CoreCLR repo?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on everything above, we'll figure out which repos are involved. "Native portions of the framework"  would include CoreFX <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/src/Native">native</a> files like ClrCompression and the Unix PAL.</p>
