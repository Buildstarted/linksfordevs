          <p>A split, concave, columnar keyboard</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2018 I was curious to see if I might remedy <a href="https://viktor.eikman.se/article/dmote-rationale/">some problems I perceived in standard keyboards</a>. I designed and built the DMOTE, short for “Dactyl-ManuForm: Opposable Thumb Edition”.</p>

<p>That’s the second complete unit. You’re supposed to reach all the keys, except the two facing you, without moving your wrists.</p>

<p>My direct inspiration is in the name: Tom Short’s <a href="https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard">Dactyl-ManuForm</a>, itself a hybrid of Matthew Adereth’s <a href="https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard">Dactyl</a> and Jeff Gran’s <a href="https://github.com/jeffgran/ManuForm">ManuForm</a>. The latter resembles the first commercially produced typewriter, the Hansen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansen_Writing_Ball">Writing Ball</a>, but even the ManuForm requires its user to press the thumb keys at an angle. Fixing that was my primary impetus when I started modifying Short’s design in January. I kept the concave finger clusters, distantly inspired by Lillian Malt’s 1970s innovations in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltron">Maltron</a> keyboards.</p>
<p>Professional CAD applications tend to be needlessly arcane: path dependent at worst and verbose at best. <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> is a lot more fun, but it does have some warts and not enough power. I was therefore happy to adopt Adereth’s approach to case design: Generate OpenSCAD code programmatically from a better language. CAD, being geometry, is logical enough to bring out the strengths of the functional programming paradigm.</p>

<p>I learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure">Clojure</a> by cleaning up Short’s fork of Adereth’s original. My only prior experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> was superficial contact with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> in a computer science course. Clojure is not the old dragon. I came to think of it as Python without the classes and statements: Elegant, more internally consistent than anything I had seen, and more pragmatic than terser functional stars like Haskell. With <a href="https://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/">Parinfer</a> handling the parentheses, Clojure was a joy to work with.</p>
<p>Case printed, I cast the wrist rests in RTV silicone, then I wired up and flashed the <a href="https://viktor.eikman.se/image/dmote-1-glamour-shot/">first working example</a> of the DMOTE in early May. This article was written on that first “production” unit (blue case) and updated on the second unit (burgundy case) in October.</p>

<p>Here’s some typing, with a notebook computer flanked by the keyboard for demonstration purposes.</p>

<p>I thank my predecessors and collaborators in the Git log for sharing their excellent work, <a href="https://github.com/veikman/dactyl-keyboard">as I share mine</a>. I am most grateful to a friend, Fredrik Hedgren, who did a great job printing my prototypes and teaching me that process. I eventually bought my own filament and borrowed a printer at work; I thank my colleagues at <a href="http://www.icomera.com/">Icomera</a> for that opportunity. When it came time to wire up the first unit, I benefited from the sage advice of Matias Sjögren.</p>
