<ul> <p>
<li><a>16 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#16_September_2019_(Resignation)">Resignation</a>)
<p>
To the MIT community,
</p><p>
I am resigning effective immediately from my position in CSAIL at
MIT.
I am doing this due to pressure on MIT and me over a series of
misunderstandings and mischaracterizations.
</p><p>
Richard Stallman </p><p>
<li><a>16 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#16_September_2019_(Defending_the_climate)">Defending the climate</a>)
<p>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/sep/15/americans-climate-change-crisis-cbs-poll">2/3
of Americans</a> now say defending the climate is urgent.
</p><p>
Now if only we can overcome <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2019-jul-oct.html#3_September_2019_(Federal_Election_Commission)">Republican
electoral cheating</a> and translate that into votes. </p><p>
<li><a>16 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#16_September_2019_(Fossil_fuels_and_wars)">Fossil fuels and wars</a>)
<p>
Ironically, the US fights wars to preserve access to fossil fuels,
which it burns copiously and that
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/09/15/climate-change-us-military-war/">creates
more occasions for wars</a>. </p><p>
<li><a>16 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#16_September_2019_(Italy_permitting_entry_of_refugees_at_sea)">Italy permitting entry of refugees at sea</a>)
<p>
Italy has started <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/15/italys-new-coalition-announces-plan-to-end-migrant-haggling-ocean-viking-disembark">permitting
entry of refugees rescued at sea</a>. </p><p>
<li><a>16 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#16_September_2019_(Politics_of_unabashed_dishonesty)">Politics of unabashed dishonesty</a>)
<p>
The UK is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/14/i-left-russia-to-escape-putin-assault-on-reason">sliding
into the politics of unabashed dishonesty</a>, following Russia,
Australia, and the US. </p><p>
<li><a>16 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#16_September_2019_(Requiring_burials_for_fetuses)">Requiring burials for fetuses</a>)
<p>
An abortion doctor who recently died is being vilified by some for
violating a recently passed Indiana law <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/15/more-than-2000-foetal-remains-found-at-home-of-former-indiana-abortion-doctor">requiring
fetuses to be buried as if they were people that had died</a>.
</p><p>
I don&apos;t think he did anything wrong by violating that law. For one
thing, we must suspect it was intended to lead people to condemn
abortion for irrational reasons.
</p><p>
I do think the clinic should have followed more carefully the other
laws, which are precautions for patients&apos; safety. </p><p>
<li><a>16 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#16_September_2019_(Water_running_out_in_region_of_Australia)">Water running out in region of Australia</a>)
<p>
A region of Australia is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/15/parts-of-regional-nsw-set-to-run-out-of-water-by-november">close
to running out of water completely</a>.
</p><p>
I hope climate activists are working to inform the people there
of how Australia&apos;s planet-roasting government is responsible. </p><p>
<li><a>16 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#16_September_2019_(Republican_cheating)">Republican cheating</a>)
<p>
Republicans &quot;won&quot; the 9th Congressional District of North Carolina by
cheating &#x2014; they <a href="https://www.gregpalast.com/jim-crow-steals-n-carolina-9th-cd/">removed
over 100,000 mostly-Democratic voters from the voting list</a> based
on vague suspicions they might have voted in another state as well.
</p><p>
The margin of the supposed Republican victory was only 4,000.
It is almost certain that the &quot;victory&quot; was due to cheating.
</p><p>
It is not illegal, or even suspect, to be registered to vote in two
states. That is what normally happens when you move to another state
and register there. Voters are not asked to tell the previous city,
&quot;I have moved away&quot;, the requirement is not to vote there.
</p><p>
However, many of the voters who were removed were not really
registered in another state. The other registration had a name that
was similar but different. Republicans do not fall into voter
suppression by accident. These schemes are carefully planned,
and <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2016-jul-oct.html#7_September_2016_(Voter_suppression_in_North_Carolina)">occasionally
politicians are heard admitting this</a>. They push as far as they
think they can get away with. </p><p>
<li><a>16 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#16_September_2019_(Destruction_of_National_Security_Council)">Destruction of National Security Council</a>)
<p>
In addition to arms-limitation treaties, Bolton <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/09/11/catastrophic-tenure-john-bolton">has
destroyed the National Security Council</a> which used to consider
issues including arms-limitation treaties. </p><p>
<li><a>16 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#16_September_2019_(India_building_prisons_for_2_million)">India building prisons for 2 million</a>)
<p>
India is building prisons for the <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/09/11/red-flag-whole-world-india-detention-camps-hold-two-million-illegals">roughly
2 million people in Assam that couldn&apos;t prove they are Indian
citizens</a>. The construction workers expect to be imprisoned there
when they finish.
</p><p>
Merely being born in India is not enough &#x2014; they have to prove
things that their ancestors in 1971 qualified. In many cases there
are no records. </p><p>
<li><a>16 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#16_September_2019_(Compostable_and_biodegradable_plastics)">Compostable and biodegradable plastics</a>)
<p>
Compostable plastic and biodegradable plastic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/12/plastic-alternatives-may-worsen-marine-pollution-mps-warn">require
a specially designed composting or biodegrading system</a>. Using
them now, in the absence of such a system, could encourage people to
throw them into the wild. </p><p> <li><a>15 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#15_September_2019_(Art_of_deception)">Art of deception</a>) <p>Ralph Nader: Avalanche-Level Liar Trump Learned <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/09/13/avalanche-level-liar-trump-learned-art-deception-pros-us-corporations"> Art of Deception From the Pros: US Corporations.</a> </p><p> <li><a>15 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#15_September_2019_(Biden_false_justifications)">Biden falsely justifies attacking Iraq</a>) <p>Biden is pushing even harder his <a href=" https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/09/13/biden-takes-iraq-lies-max-democratic-debate"> falsifications to justify his voting for attacking Iraq.</a> </p><p> <li><a>15 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#15_September_2019_(Ban_loot_boxes)">Ban gaming loot boxes</a>) <p>Gamers in general feel manipulated by loot boxes. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-49674333">When Belgium banned them entirely, the users were glad.</a> </p><p>Let&apos;s ban them everywhere. </p><p>Note: I reject all these games for another reason: they are nonfree software. </p><p> <li><a>15 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#15_September_2019_(Online_shopping_costs_jobs)">Buying online creates unemployment</a>) <p>Buying on-line not only mistreats you (with nonfree client code and making a dossier of your purchases), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/sep/12/online-shopping-forcing-women-out-of-work-study">it also has brought about the loss of many jobs</a>. In the UK, 75,000 jobs have been lost this way. </p><p> <li><a>15 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#15_September_2019_(Oil_facility_hit_by_drone)">Saudi Arabia oil facility hit by drone strike</a>) <p><a href=" https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/14/major-saudi-arabia-oil-facilities-hit-by-drone-strikes">An oil refinery in Salafi Arabia has been set on fire by a drone attack.</a> </p><p>It couldn&apos;t have happened to a more deserving country. </p><p>If the inflow of petroleum can be cut off, the fire itself should not last long. I hope so. Then refinery will be out of service. That will reduce the supply of oil and gasoline. That would be an opportunity for conservation, but I think the planet-roasters will try to make it an excuse to build more fossil-fuel facilities elsewhere. </p><p> <li><a>15 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#15_September_2019_(Palestinian_discrimination)">Israeli Arab lawmakers discriminated</a>) <p>Arab members of Israel&apos;s parliament face the <a href="https://mondoweiss.net/2019/09/international-palestinian-discrimination/">constant threat of expulsion for opposing the majority (as they were elected to do).</a> </p><p> <li><a>15 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#15_September_2019_(East_Jerusalem_Arab_Harrasment)">Violent harrasment of Arabs in East Jerusalem</a>) <p>Israeli thugs in an Arab area of East Jerusalem practice <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5582348,00.html">continual violent harassment</a> on any excuse. Sometimes the violence is deadly. </p><p> <li><a>15 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#15_September_2019_(Two_state_solution)">Two state solution</a>) <p>The <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/The-two-state-solution-can-be-achieved-through-a-confederation-601058"> &quot;two-state solution can be achieved through a confederation,&quot;</a> proposes the &quot;A Land For ALL&quot; movement. </p><p>

<p> Bernie Sanders says DMVs <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7a3y/bernie-sanders-dmvs-stop-selling-profiting-drivers-data">should stop profiting from drivers&#x2019; personal data</a>. </p><p>

It will not be easy to prevail over the sabotage-minded Senate. But it is better to try than not try. </p><p>
<li><a>15 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#15_September_2019_(Germany_and_nazism)">Germany and Nazism</a>)
<p> Studying Germany&apos;s effort to learn to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/13/susan-neiman-interview-learning-from-the-germans">reject the ideas of its Nazi past</a>. </p><p>
<li><a>15 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#15_September_2019_(Bleach)">Bleach</a>)
<p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/13/science-on-safety-of-chlorinated-chicken-misunderstood">Scientists report</a> that dipping chickens in bleach does not kill
all the dangerous bacteria. Some of them convert into spores,
which are hard to detect without special tests, so the chicken
appears safer but isn&apos;t. </p><p>
<li><a>15 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#15_September_2019_(Body_cameras)">Body cameras</a>)
<p> California is adopting a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-facial-recognition/california-legislature-bars-facial-recognition-for-police-body-cameras-idUSKCN1VX2ZP">ban on face recognition in thugs&apos; body cameras</a>. </p><p>
It is a significant first step in making body cameras do good and
not harm, but much more is needed. If the system saves the video when
there is no specific justification to do so, it becomes a system to
surveil people&apos;s houses at will. I recommend an automatic system that
can determine when to save the footage. </p><p>
<li><a>14 September 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#14_September_2019_(Statements_about_Epstein)">Statements about Epstein</a>)
<p>
I want to respond to the misleading media coverage of messages I
posted about Marvin Minsky&apos;s association with Jeffrey Epstein. The
coverage totally mischaracterised my statements.
</p><p>
Headlines say that I defended Epstein. Nothing could be further from
the truth. I&apos;ve called him a &quot;serial rapist&quot;, and said he deserved to
be imprisoned. But many people now believe I defended him &#x2014; and
other inaccurate claims &#x2014; and feel a real hurt because of what
they believe I said.
</p><p>
I&apos;m sorry for that hurt. I wish I could have prevented the
misunderstanding. </p><p>

it because they carried out a bomb attack in Afghanistan</a>. (No
cease-fire had been agreed.)
</p><p>
Lots of politicians criticized him for this, al everyone assuming he
was telling the truth about what he had done. I wouldn&apos;t believe, on
his say-so, that he had cancelled a meeting, or that there ever was a
plan for a meeting.
</p><p>
Then the Taliban <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/09/taliban-trump-afghanistan-us-talks-election-violence">affirmed
that the bullshitter cancelled a meeting with them</a>. Amazing
&#x2014; he told the truth about this!
</p><p>
I don&apos;t agree with the critics that there is anything wrong in
inviting Taliban negotiators to meet with US representatives, whether
in the US, or anywhere else. I am surprised though that they trusted
him enough to say they would come.

The bullshitter&apos;s approach to diplomacy is to posture as tough by

selling them, and the lease says that all offspring belong to China.
But this is no reason for Germans to call the pandas by the names that
China says are &quot;official&quot;.

a little exaggerated, since the rest of the Earth&apos;s forest share in

I can think of two ways parents can work together to resist this swindle:
<ul>
<li>
Make unauthorized copies of the school&apos;s logo and sew it onto cheap generic uniforms.
</li>
<li>
Organize a &quot;uniform strike&quot;. If enough parents together refuse to buy the expensive uniforms, they can make the school back down.
</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, they can teach their children how to respond with defiance
if anyone in the school sneers at them for not having the fancy
expensive school-specific uniform: &quot;My parents are right to prioritize
things that we really need. If you want to blame someone, blame the
Tories for allowing schools to demand expensive uniforms which are a
burden on students&apos; families. And for making so many Britons poor.&quot; </p><p>

non-Caucasian actors in Caucasian roles too?

That issue does not apply to Jews, because Jews have not, in general,
been excluded from roles that are not defined as Jewish. Nobody

I feel for Tyson, and for Amiri; but when he demands that the British

of anarchism</a>.
</p><p>
A hundred years ago, there were anarchist societies on Earth, places
where there was no state, no government. But that did not in all
cases mean that everyone was equal. In some peoples in Melanesia, the
men who were most politically adroit gained a kind of political power
by drawing other men into client relationships with them. Those who
had many clients were called &quot;big men&quot;, and sometimes they would lead
their clients to fight the clients of other big men.
</p><p>
The fighting continued until European colonial states made them stop.
&quot;Big men&quot; continued to exist, but they were limited to peaceful means
in their competition for power.
</p><p>
I feel an attraction to anarchy, but I do not endorse anarchism
because there are <a href="/articles/why-we-need-a-state.html">many jobs we need the
state to do</a>. </p><p>
<li><a>23 August 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#23_August_2019_(Tuvalu_and_Australia)">Tuvalu and Australia</a>)

their government from wiping out Tuvalu and then Australia</a>.
</p><p>
If peaceful means do not succeed in preventing the murder of billions,
violent means will be justified. Given that Australia&apos;s present
course of action will predictably kill tens of millions of people
(that would be Australia&apos;s share of the billions), destroying
Australia&apos;s fossil fuel facilities should be legally justified under
the principle of necessity (to prevent a worse crime).
</p><p>
Since the operation of Australia&apos;s fossil fuel facilities and shipping
will contribute to making many lands uninhabitable, including Tuvalu,
they are in effect weapons of mass destruction. Perhaps Tuvalu should
declare war on Australia and send commandos to destroy those
facilities and sink the coal ships. </p><p>

</p><p>
I suppose Danes feel relieved rather than punished.
</p><p>
This is not the first time the US demanded to buy another country&apos;s
territory. In 1845 the US asked to buy a part of Mexico. When Mexico
refused, the US Army fought its way to Mexico City and occupied it
until Mexico&apos;s government agreed to the sale. Henry David Thoreau
famously went to jail rather than pay tax for that war of aggression.

</p><p>
Although these people appear feckless, I think they posed somewhat of
a real threat -- more so than the Walter Mitty-ish would-be Islamist

</p><p>
Those people dreamed of making a bomb, but would never have been in a

they were not really capable of hurting anyone. In addition,

</p><p>
Notice the words &quot;it is said&quot; which the article used to cast doubt
on the practical reasons to put the telescope there, while saying nothing
about what they are.
</p><p>
Some obvious reasons why Mauna Kea is an unusually good place to put
the world&apos;s biggest telescope: Mauna Kea is high (better seeing
conditions); the air is clean (better seeing conditions); there is
very little light pollution (fainter objects are visible); it is
fairly close to the equator (can view nearly all the sky); there is
already a good road down to facilities not far away (makes construction
cheaper).

Blocking the telescope would do no actual good for Hawaiians and would
be a loss for all humanity. </p><p>

There was a protest in favor of democracy in Hong Kong in Melbourne,
Australia. State-managed Chinese social media stirred up a lot of
young Chinese expats to rally against them.

tussle developed</a>.
</p><p>
The article does not say, but I expect that the supporters of China
started the tussle. Propaganda has taught them that the cause of
China&apos;s power is sacred and that anyone who questions it is evil.
</p><p>
Many Chinese students go to Australia, and China has a history of
using them
for <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2019-may-aug.html#6_August_2019_(China_surveils_students_abroad)">political
intimidation</a> in Australia.
It is important to develop systematic ways to expose students from
China to other values while they are in Australia.
</p><p>
One idea that occurs to me is to have a kiosk which can tell people
whether their mobile phones, which they have &quot;switched off&quot;, are
really off. It would be interesting to tell students from China
whether China is snooping on the conversations around them. It would
be interesting for everyone else that carries a Stalin&apos;s Dream device,
too. </p><p>

The comparison actually described by the surgeon was between

than the wounds made by handguns. This means I need to change the
conclusions I drew.

contained in a fixed part of the rifle rather than in a magazine that

can mention.
<ul>
<li>
Big Pharma loves NAFTA 2.0 because it guarantees them monopoly powers
to delay generic competition and lock in high drug prices.</li>
<li>
Big oil is lobbying for the deal because it lets them attack Mexican
climate and environmental policies.</li>
<li>
Corporations that have used NAFTA to outsource hundreds of thousands
of jobs to Mexico to pay workers pennies on the dollar are thrilled
the revised deal&apos;s labor and environmental terms are too weak to stop
more job outsourcing.</li>

US agribusiness has used NAFTA to ruin Mexican peasants. They can&apos;t
produce as cheaply as machines in US factory farms, but Mexico had
enough food.</li>

&quot;Subsidize a business to make jobs&quot; is a form of trickle-down: making
welfare payments to businesses so that a fraction of the money will
reach non-rich citizens. As governments do this, they help businesses
pressure them to do ever more of it.

The US pharma system was designed so that the public pays for the

Pharma is one of the areas where patents do <a href="https://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/students/publications/llj/pdfs/45_1_stallman.pdf">special harm.</a>

It is unfortunate that the article occasionally says &quot;IP&quot; when it

bogus <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html">overgeneralization &quot;intellectual property&quot; embodies.</a>
</p><p>
The article suggests using compulsory licenses to knock down these
patents when they endanger the public. I&apos;m entirely in favor of that,
but I think we need to cure the disease, not just treat the symptoms.
</p><p>
The cure I recommend is to take the testing of drugs out of the hands
of drug manufacturers, thus eliminating their argument for artificial
monopolies, and turn them into generic manufacturers. </p><p>

</p><p>
This is clearly unjust. And there is no pressing need to punish
stoned drivers, because they are much less of a danger than drunk

</p><p>
In the mean time, it should be possible to test whether a driver is
currently mentally impaired, never mind the reason (marijuana,
illness, lack of sleep). If so, it is possible to lead the driver to

Biden is being attacked for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/joe-biden-poor-kids-white-gaffe-iowa">minor verbal slip</a>.
</p><p>
He contrasted &quot;poor&quot; with &quot;white&quot;, when saying that children of both
groups have the same potential. Maybe he meant to condemn racial
discrimination, or maybe he meant to condemn economic discrimination,
but he got the two confused and ended up condemning a mixture of both.
</p><p>
Is that a bad thing? We know that the two discriminations often operate
in parallel.
</p><p>
I will not vote for Biden, but that&apos;s for reasons of substance: he
does not oppose the plutocracy which promotes racism and is makes
economic discrimination so bad. </p><p>

</p><p>
It is evidently unjust, and when the state presents it as justice,
it distorts the basic idea of justice.
</p><p>
The mention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Holle">Ryan Holle</a> in the article is somewhat misleading. He was aware that his roommate wanted the car that day for a robbery.
</p><p>
It would have been just to prosecute him as an accessory to robbery.
</p><p>
It is clear on the general principles of penology why this bonus
punishment does nothing to deter other crimes: the situation is so
unlikely to arise (when people carry out some other crime) that it is
effectively a freak accident. It won&apos;t affect the mental calculations
of anyone planning a robbery.
</p><p>
Making freak accidents worse is not a service to the public. </p><p>

Since this is not a direct threat to the West, perhaps the West has no
reason to fight it. However, any region that al-Qa&apos;ida comes to
dominate will suffer a great loss of human rights. The US should not
intervene militarily, since that would only create an Afghanistan-like
situation. But if local people want to fight back, it would be good to

A father plans

</p><p>
This is a real-life variant
of <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/trolley-problem.html">the
trolley problem</a>,
with a crucial difference: in this case there was time to study the
issue carefully and establish with near certainty what each choice
would lead to before making the decision. He cannot rationally deny
that his choice of &quot;do nothing&quot; means death for both of daughters.
</p><p>
His choice is a form of moral cowardice. The kind of cowardice that
makes someone lose a tooth rather than get a filling. The kind of
cowardice that makes someone die of late-stage cancer rather than get
early treatment and survive. So even though I empathize with his
distress at the need to choose between horrible and doubly horrible, I
can&apos;t excuse his decision. The daughters deserve life. If you can&apos;t
save both, at least save one.
</p><p>
I don&apos;t think that we should be more concerned about the couple
because they have four other children. Having so many is a bad thing
to do, but it has no effect on the issue of saving these daughters. </p><p>

themselves to other ways of thinking.

<li><a>30 July 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#30_July_2019_(Al_Franken)">Al Franken</a>)
<p>
Al Franken now
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/29/the-case-of-al-franken">regrets
resigning from the Senate</a>. Some senators that pushed him to
resign
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/22/al-franken-resignation-senators-regret">now
regret that too</a>.
</p><p>
The first (main) article does not state clearly whether Franken
touched Tweeden in the process of making the photo, but it seems he
did not. If that is correct, it was not a sexual act at all. It was
self-mocking humor. The photograph depicted a fictional sexual act
without her fictional consent, but making the photo wasn&apos;t a sexual
act.
</p><p>
If it is true that he persistently pressured her to kiss him, on stage
and off, if he stuck his tongue into her mouth despite her objections,
that could well be sexual harassment. He should have accepted no for
an answer the first time she said it. However, calling a kiss &quot;sexual
assault&quot; is an exaggeration, an attempt to equate it to much graver
acts, that are crimes.
</p><p>
The term
<a href="https://stallman.org/antiglossary.html#assult">&quot;sexual
assault&quot;</a> encourages that injustice, and I believe it has been
popularized specifically with that intention. That is why I reject
that term.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Franken says he did not do those things, and the other
actors he previously did the same USO skit with said it was not
harassment, just acting. Tweeden&apos;s store is clearly false in many
details.
</p><p>
Should we assume Tweeden was honest? With so many demonstrated
falsehoods in her accusations, and given that she planned them with
other right-wing activists, and that all of them follow a leader who
lies as a tactic every day, I have to suspect that she decided to
falsify accusations through exaggeration so as to kick a strong
Democrat out of the Senate.
</p><p>
I have no proof of that suspicion. It is possible that she made the
accusations honestly. Also, in a hypothetical world, someone might
really have done them. Supposing for the moment that those
accusations were true, should Franken have resigned over them?
</p><p>
I don&apos;t think so. They are misjudgments, not crimes. Franken
deserved the chance to learn from the criticism that surprised him.
Zero tolerance is a very bad way to judge people.
</p><p>
However, the most important point is to reject the position that if B
feels hurt by what A said or did, then automatically A is wrong.
People judged Franken that way, and he judged himself that way. But
that way degrades the concept of &quot;wrong&quot; into a mere expression of
subjective disapproval. What can legitimately be asserted
subjectively can legitimately be ignored subjectively too. To judge A
that way is to set B up as a tyrant.
</p><p>
If B&apos;s feelings were hurt, that&apos;s unfortunate -- but is that A&apos;s
fault? If so, was it culpable, or just a mistake? That is what we
have to judge, and if we want others to think our judgments worth
following, they must be based on objective facts and objective
standards, including objective standards for what words and gestures
objectively mean.
</p><p>
Traister is wrestling with a solvable problem. She says, &quot;When you
change rules, you end up penalizing people who were caught behaving
according to the old rules.&quot; Maybe people do, but that is a sign of
carelessness. It isn&apos;t really hard to change the rules and then judge
old actions by the old rules. We just have to remember to do so. </p><p>

This particular work has a peak season in September. In a government
office, the staff would focus on this during the peak season, then
most would shift to other tasks for the rest or the year. A private

stable than civil servants, and its other contracts come and go.

Let&apos;s look at the argument that Hong Kongers should surrender their

</p><p>
But let&apos;s suppose that 30 million really do have hurt feelings. It
could be so. If so, why are their feelings hurt? Why do they even
pay attention to Hong Kong? It&apos;s because they are more or less
Xi-ple; the state media tells them to feel hurt, and they do not doubt
what they are told.
</p><p>
Any number of people who demand your surrender because they herded to do so
amount to no reason for you to do that. </p><p>

Why are companies rushing to replace human workers with robots based

to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/30/robots-definitely-coming-make-world-more-unequal-place">make
the rich richer</a>, and the poor poorer as a byproduct.
</p><p>
Additional robots are greatly reducing the number of jobs in
manufacturing, and are likely
to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/30/changing-fast-benefits-dangers-robots-uk-workplace">continue doing so</a>.
</p><p>
The fact that one particular factory in the UK has more staff now than
in 2007 is neither here nor there. Evidently a bigger fraction of the
country&apos;s manufacturing has been concentrated there.
</p><p>
The increase in productivity is a benefit to whoever owns the factory,
and the small fraction of people employed there. But it is not good
for society overall unless those benefits are shared with society
overall.
</p><p>
It is a mistake to see the issue in nationalistic terms as a
competition with other countries. It does no good to country C to
have robot factories there rather than in D, E and F, if the benefits
go in each case only to the few owners. What matters to country C is
making sure the people there who don&apos;t own plenty of stock in robot
factories can nonetheless enjoy the products of these factories, and
everything else one needs for a good life. </p><p>

Bravo for the article, but one quotation falls into a widespread
confusion: that spread by the term &quot;intellectual property&quot;.
<blockquote>
and &quot;If you hire a managed service provider to do your network security
they could, instead,... steal your intellectual property.&quot;
</blockquote>
</p><p>
In general, that statement is false. It could not steal your
copyrights, or your patents, or your trademarks, or your plant variety
monopolies, or your IC mask monopolies, or your publicity rights &#x2014;
those are legal privileges, so they can&apos;t be &quot;stolen&quot;. I think the
only things it could possibly steal that way are trade secrets.
</p><p>
Please <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html">don&apos;t ever
say &quot;intellectual property&quot;</a> if what you mean is &quot;trade secrets&quot; or
if what you mean is &quot;copyrights&quot;, or if what you mean is any
other specific thing, because that is a big generalization. It is
likely to convert a narrow true statement into a broad false one.
</p><p>
If you think that what you mean is all of them, then please study the
issue more carefully &#x2014; a statement so general is usually false,
and probably most of them are not even relevant to the issue at hand.
</p><p>
If you want to quote a statement where someone else used the term
&quot;intellectual property&quot;, please check whether the statement was false
due to this confusion. Any statement that used that term probably
was confused. </p><p>

</p><p>
It does not seem to propose how to develop an AI to be trustworthy,
how to determine whether a given AI program is infact trustworthy, or
how any AI program can be trustworthy. As far as I know, these are
totally unsolved problems, but the report takes for granted some

</p><p>
This was clearly an act of war, and justifies military action Iran&apos;s part.
</p><p>
The capture <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/05/spain-to-lodge-complaint-over-british-seizure-of-oil-tanker-gibraltar">took place in disputed waters near Gibraltar</a>, and Spain
has objected to it.
</p><p>
I can&apos;t see what relevance EU sanctions have. If the are sanctions,
they prohibit certain dealings between EU entities and Syria. I don&apos;t
see how an Iranian ship would come under EU sanctions, unless it is owned
by a European company.
</p><p>
Only a blockade would purport go that far, and a blockade, if there
were one, would be an act of war in itself. (Remember when Egypt
blockaded Elat? Israel responded to that, legitimately, by capturing
the Sinai.)

I don&apos;t think the EU has announced a blockade of Syria. Indeed, it is
unable to do such a thing; the whole field of war is outside the EU&apos;s

<p>
Norway focused its prison system on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-48885846">rehabilitation</a>, and recidivism
declined from 60-70% to 20-25%.
</p><p>
Rehabilitation costs more per prisoner but results in having much
fewer prisons.
</p><p>
I suspect that lowering recidivism that much depends on having a
society that offers ex-cons a way to get by, other than through crime.
My impression is that in the US it is so hard to get a job with an
income you can live on, if you have a criminal record, that many
ex-cons that want to go straight are unable to make a go of it. If
the goal is to reduce the harm done by crime, this is self-defeating.
</p><p>
But then, the US also puts a terrible burden on poor people, and on
various disprivileged demographics, even if they don&apos;t have a criminal
record. It is a general pattern of dehumanization, rather than a
constructive attempt to address a problem. </p><p>

A Starbucks worker asked a few <a href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> (who were there as customers) to
move because someone <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/07/starbucks-apologises-police-tempe-arizona">felt threatened by them</a>. Starbucks apologized.
</p><p>
If the representative of the <a href="/glossary.html#thug">thug</a> association really can&apos;t imagine why
some customers felt threatened, he is mentally deficient, but I think
it more likely he is covering up that side of the truth. I know, from
reading the news and talking with acquaintances, why blacks may feel
endangered by the presence of <a href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a>. Other people, with less grounds,
may feel endangered by the presence of blacks.
</p><p>
A store should not ask customers to leave, or to move, because
&quot;someone feels threatened by you&quot; &#x2014; not blacks, and not <a href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> &#x2014;
because people should not be judged based on how someone else feels
about them. </p><p>

</p><p>

I must criticize, however, the basic confusion spread by use of
the term &quot;intellectual property&quot;, which misrepresents the facts
about various disparate laws by leading people to think of
them as one single thing.

Patent law is different from copyright law on nearly every point.
Neither of them has any similarity to trade secrecy, and they have
hardly any relationship with trademark law. If you have a category of
&quot;intellectual property&quot; in your thinking, it will always mislead you.

Trade secrecy is <em>always</em> bad for the public. Occasionally it
is deadly, but usually merely harmful. We should change the law so
that no significant problem can be concealed in this way.

It is a good start, but I think it can be improved in some areas. For
example, it makes general statements about &quot;intellectual property&quot;

think it&apos;s the same for &quot;sausage&quot; &amp;mdash sausages also can have many kinds
of ingredients.
</p><p>
However, it should be illegal to use the words &quot;meat&quot; or &quot;beef&quot; to
name a product which isn&apos;t made (respectively) from meat, or from
beef. </p><p>

Since this bill would only apply to government use of face

In my personal experience, the border guards that give me the most

human but was apparently a robot, demanded I say what I would do when
I returned to the US, while threatening to send me to the US (but not
the US city I was connecting for).
</p><p>
Once in the 90s a couple of US customs agents decided to harass me by
searching my luggage, slowly. As I was not in a hurry and had only
permitted goods to import, I responded by taking a friendly tone and
complying with utmost diligence and care, which required me to go even
more slowly than they did. Eventually they realized that their
harassment tactic had backfired, so they finished the search quickly. </p><p>

Jewish Human Rights Scholar: Yes, America
Has <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/06/21/1-they-came-for-the-mexicans.html">Built
Concentration Camps</a>.
And it is not surprising that some of the prisoners in them have
died as a result of the systematic mistreatment.
</p><p>
The term &quot;concentration camp&quot; was initially used as a euphemism for
prisons into which colonial powers (Spain, the US, and Germany) and
conquerors (including the UK) forced a civilian population which was
sheltering and aiding rebels. Killing them was not the specific
intention, but in many of these camps the general mistreatment and
lack of medical care killed substantial numbers of the prisoners.
This
is <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/06/21/migrant-children-imprisoned-texas-detail-border-patrols-level-inhumanity">what
the US is doing now</a> to unauthorized immigrants.
</p><p>
The Nazis built political prisons which were referred to as
&quot;concentration camps&quot;. Initially they did not murder prisoners
outright but systematically worked prisoners to death. Later the
Nazis began directly murdering large numbers of Jews (and others) in
some of these camps. Thus, the term became associated with outright
mass murder.
</p><p>
The writer of that article believes that massive imprisonment is the
penultimate step on the road to genocide. This may be right, because
the conditions that lead to setting up such camps generate hatred.

even work any more</a>.
</p><p>
Many other insurance plans are equally bad, and it affects other
medical specialties, not just psychiatrists.

intentionally to discourage patients from getting care, and thus

</p><p>

Naturally, these workers are subcontracted, so that Facebook can deny
responsibility for how they are treated. But Facebook is in fact
responsible: it demands contractors offer a low price, which they
achieve by treating the workers like shit. We need laws to hold
companies like Facebook responsible for the treatment of indirect
workers, and give them employee rights such as sick leave.

It should be a felony for employees of a company to ask a worker to

</p><p>
This reminds me of the way right-wing politicians cited Iraq Body
Count to undercount the number of Iraqi war dead from <a href="/glossary.html#dubya">Dubya</a>&apos;s
occupation of Iraq. Iraq Body Count did (does?) a valuable job by
making a list of the identified, reported deaths, but using that to
estimate the total will obviously give a low result.
</p><p>
I think Iraq Body Count ought to make a prominent statement to this
effect. Maybe the IUCN Red List should do likewise.

In the case of extinction, we cannot detect the extinction of species
whose existence we have not yet recognized. These could number in the
millions. </p><p>

being used in political manipulation</a>. The success of the
bullshitter, and Republicans who pressure each other to believe even

</p><p>
The hypothetical deepfake described at the end of the article goes
only a little beyond what the bullshitter has already hinted at. It
would not surprise me if he really said that, before the 2020
election. By lying repeatedly about his past statements, he has
prepared a situation in which we would be unable to tell if such a
video is true or fake.

<p>
The &quot;young adult&quot; book category is consuming itself with censorship
demands. Many books have
been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/15/torn-apart-the-vicious-war-over-young-adult-books">withdrawn
or cancelled</a> in response to pressure campaigns accusing the
authors of various sorts of &quot;insensitivity&quot; or &quot;cultural
appropriation&quot;.
</p><p>
The critics demand authors portray every minority in a &quot;sensitive&quot;
way. Is there anyone in the world that can do this? Any given human
being belongs only to a few groups. An author will have to play safe
by assigning every character to the groups <a href="/glossary.html#perse">perse</a> belongs to. But this
would trigger condemnation for a lack of diversity.
</p><p>
It looks like young adult books will have to be written by committees
that can provide sensitive treatment of many different intersections
of minority groups. The publisher would apply for a sensitivity
certification from the Sensitivity Authority, which might demand
changes. Then it would direct readers to send their complaints to the
SA if they think its evaluation standards ought to be changed.
</p><p>
I have decided to oppose <em>all</em> campaigns that demand publishers
withdraw a book, or a contribution to a book &#x2014; regardless of
what reasons are cited. Demanding censorship of books is in itself
destructive. Even if the name presented on the book as author were

<p>
A concert near you may be a little piece of China: a new system would
let them use face recognition systems to identify anyone who tries to
enter. The developers of the system explicitly state that the purpose
of this is to exclude
people <a href="https://www.ticketnews.com/2019/05/new-ticketing-platform-facial-recognition/">based
on what they have said</a>.
If a concert required me to identify myself, I&apos;d refuse outright.
</p><p>
If it is only concerts, it would not be a disaster. We can live
without going to large concerts. But the developers want to use it to
keep people out of train stations (and trains). That would be little
different
