No. But we have come to believe that the best way forward is for alt .net to evolve. Communities thrive on unity, and in today‚Äôs landscape I believe we will become a stronger community and do more to advance development practices in the .net community by coming together with other parts of the Melbourne .net community.</p><p id="a232" data-selectable-paragraph="">What this looks like we‚Äôre not sure yet‚Ä¶ and is something we‚Äôll work out together. If you‚Äôve enjoyed our community or would like to be a part of shaping what comes next, we‚Äôd love to hear from you! We‚Äôll be getting a group of amazing people together ‚Äî along with members of VIC .net and other parts of the Melbourne community ‚Äî early next year to begin to shape the things to come. We would really love it for you to be a part of that. Please contact me clicking ‚ÄúSend Jim Pelletier a message‚Äù in this email, via meetup message or on twitter to find out more (@pjimmy my DMs are open).</p><p id="65c2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Many thanks are due to everyone who has made this community an amazing one to be a part of for close to 15 years. There are far too many of you to single out, but we‚Äôre so very thankful to every one of you who has made this such an amazing community‚Ä¶ you all know who you are :) And of course I have to give a big shout out to Andrew Bienert for getting us started all those years ago, and Page Up for being such an accomodating host in recent years.</p><p id="d89f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Lookout for the announcement of a final <a href="http://alt.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">alt.net</a> social gathering early in the new year and stay tuned to this meetup to see what exciting new thing rises from these ashes :)</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*iacEuSgBns1lpv_H.jpg?q=20" width="651" height="383" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="651" height="383" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></figure></div></div></section></div></div></div>
