<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
        <p>One thing that bothers me about the new wizard is that Stack Overflow was originally something of an attempt to collaboratively build an FAQ; the ideal was that people who had a question about programming wouldn't have to ask it on Stack Overflow, because the question would already be there, and the answer would already be there, thus there'd be no need to post a duplicate.</p>

<p>The emphasis on "show your code" in the new question wizard means that generic questions whose answers would benefit everyone are now more or less impossible to post. Let's take <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/266704">this question</a>, which I selected semi-arbitrarily, as an example; I'd consider it a good example of an FAQ-style question which is likely to be of benefit to any reader which has a question about weak references in JavaScript. Now imagine a new user trying to post a good, ontopic, generally useful question like that one using the new question wizard. </p>

<p>Their first step is to list their type of question, and they already get stuck: it's not a question about code, it's not a homework problem, it's not asking for a recommendation, it's not a troubleshooting issue. So they have to choose "Other". Now for the question to be appropriate to SO, it needs to "include a bit of code", "concern a specific coding issue, algorithm, or language", "not be opinion-based". The second and third categories definitely fit. The first doesn't. Is this an "and" or an "or"? The page doesn't use a conjunction. Treating it as an "and" quickly reaches a dead end (even though it looks like one!), so let's assume our user decides to treat it as an "or" and continues asking on Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>The next step is tags (OK, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript" title="show questions tagged 'javascript'" rel="tag">javascript</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/weak-references" title="show questions tagged 'weak-references'" rel="tag">weak-references</a>, that's easy). Step after that is title; "Does JavaScript have weak references?" seems like a reasonable title. Then comes the duplicate check, and there are no duplicates listed. (Of course, because I'm using an existing question as an example for this thought experiment, there actually <em>is</em> a duplicate! But the duplicate check doesn't find it simply from the tags and title. That shouldn't be much of a surprise; the text of the post is the most helpful part for duplicate-searching, so the duplicate search and post-writing pretty much have to happen in parallel, like they do with the old workflow.)</p>

<p>Our hypothetical user, now that they think there are no duplicates, starts trying to write the text of the post, and everything starts falling apart:</p>

<ol>
<li>Summarize the problem</li>
<li>Provide background including what you've already tried</li>
<li>Show some code</li>
<li>Describe expected and actual results</li>
</ol>

<p>How many of these points fit? 1 sort-of, 2 and 4 very tenuously, 3 not at all. It's not possible to write this question using the template used by the new wizard, because it's a generic question describing a generic issue, and which gains as a result of that. The template is basically trying to force Stack questions posts to look like a "debug my code for me" or "help me finish my unfinished code" question. Now, it's pretty good at making those sorts of questions provide the information they need for people to solve them; but it's immediately repelling any other sort of question, including the fundamental questions that Stack Overflow derives most of its value from. Most frequently-asked-questions won't have a corresponding frequently-given-code-sample to go with them!</p>

<p>The fix to this would probably be to add an extra path through the wizard, but I'm not immediately sure what it would look like or what sort of information it would need to aim for.</p>
