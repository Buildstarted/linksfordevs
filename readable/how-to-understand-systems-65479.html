<!-- How to understand a system -->
<!-- Tales of feedback loops, leverage points and bottlenecks. -->

<p>To solve a problem, you first need to understand the problem.</p>

<p><a href="https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html">Problems exist within systems.</a></p>

<p>So, to understand the problem, you need to understand the system.</p>

<!-- One of the key aspects of working with any system is figuring out how it works.[^1]  -->

<!-- [^1]: This is probably true for everything. To work with X you need to figure out how X works. -->

<p>By systems I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complex adaptive systems</a>. They are the most interesting kind, and difficult to deal with.</p>

<p>Complex, because removing a part destroys the system. Each part is interdependent on other parts. Like removing a heart from the human body.</p>

<p>Adaptive, because each part reacts to what the other parts do. Like the heart pumping faster when artery blockages develop.</p>

<p>Treating complex systems like a black-box, where you figure out the problem by trying solutions is a terrible idea. Imagine going to a doctor and without listening to you, the doctor gives you aspirin. Do you feel better? No? Then paracetamol. Still no? An antacid. Still no?&nbsp;.. Sigh, okay, tell me what’s wrong?</p>

<p>But that’s how we solve most surface problems. And in simple systems, it usually works.</p>

<p>The key is, can you distinguish between simple and complex systems?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t know what to call it, you can’t distinguish it.<sup id="fnref:1" data-footnote-backlink-ref="fnref:1" data-footnote-ref="#fn:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Every time you hit your mobile phone hoping it would start working, you're treating it like a black box. -->

<p>An alternative is white-box thinking. Here, we dissect the system, get into its internals and figure out why things weren’t working, or how the system works.</p>

<!-- With simple systems, it's faster to take the blackbox approach. Over time, this becomes a habit. Things get dangerous when we stop distinguishing between simple and complex systems. -->

<p>I think there are at least two ways to figure out a system.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simulate the system</li>
  <li>Experiment with the system</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="simulation">Simulation</h2>

<p>Simulation is either computational or thought based.</p>

<p>One is running a computer simulation,<br>
the other is running a thought experiment.</p>

<p>In both cases, what you get are insights into how the system works. They go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Both need a basic understanding of how things will work - without an existing model, you can’t simulate. These methods are also used to refine your model. For example, you start with a barebones model built by experience. Then, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you run it</a>. Then, you improve the model based on the difference in results between your model and the world.</p>

<p>One pillar example of simulation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Limits to Growth</a> done in 1972. It tracks the demise of humans on the current trajectory of consumption and environment degradation.</p>

<p>Criticized in the beginning, LTG has come to be accepted as the model predicting reality, now that we have 50 years of living the model behind us.</p>

<!-- Put in enough loops in a system and what you get is the human world. Imperfect, lots of actors, lots of variables, no accepted unifying principle. -->

<!-- Humans are interesting. We can inspect systems we are a part of. Not that we succeed every time, with our emotions getting the better of us. -->

<h3 id="thought-experiments">Thought experiments</h3>

<p>Take a hypothesis, theory or a principle. Think through what will happen if it were true. That’s a thought experiment.</p>

<p>Consider an example - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schrödinger’s cat</a> (1935). It presents a cat that is indeterminately alive or dead, depending on a random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_indeterminacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum event</a>. Figuring out if it’s alive or not is dependent on looking in the box. Till that point, it’s both, alive and dead.</p>

<p>What makes this thought experiment so great is the way it explains quantum theory. Say, instead, you had a coin inside the box. You can toss this coin by pressing a button outside the box. If it’s heads, the cat will die. Tails, and it lives. With every button press, the probability to live decreases, but at no point is that cat both alive and dead. Is your mind blowing to pieces yet?</p>

<!-- Thought experiments are all about running experiments in the mind - to figure out the system, by simulating what you think will happen when you do X. 
unconsciously/consciously using the equations fed to your simulation model. -->

<h4 id="the-process">The process</h4>

<p>You begin with a set of hypothesis about what would happen.<br>
You run through them in your mind</p>

<p>There are two things that might happen.<br>
You arrive at an outcome different from what you expect<br>
You arrive at your version of reality</p>

<p>Both cases are a cause for concern.<br>
You confirm that’s what would happen in the real world, via experience<br>
If your model is close enough to the real world, profit.<br>
else you refine your hypothesis and restart.</p>

<h2 id="experimentation">Experimentation</h2>

<p>Here, we enter the territory of real world experiments with real world consequences that might change the state of the system.</p>

<p>You’re perturbing the system to try and figure out what will happen. Thus, you want to experiment with small changes first.<sup id="fnref:4" data-footnote-backlink-ref="fnref:4" data-footnote-ref="#fn:4"><a href="#fn:4">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Want universal basic income? Try experimenting in a few cities first. it’s A/B testing on whatever scale works.</p>

<p>The only caveat: things break when you scale up.</p>

<p>Experimentation with system is needed when your imagination can’t keep up with what you’re seeing. This usually happens in complex systems. There are too many variables - you don’t know half of them, and you can’t keep the other half in your brain.<sup id="fnref:3" data-footnote-backlink-ref="fnref:3" data-footnote-ref="#fn:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<figure>

<p>The main aim, using the above approaches is to build an accurate-enough model. One that behaves the same way the system behaves, given the same input.</p>

<p>Input → System → Output<br>
Input → Model → Output</p>

<p>Fair warning though, knowing this model isn’t the same as controlling the system. That’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(cybernetics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Law of Requisite Variety</a> - to control a system, you need a controller at least as complex as the system.</p>

<p><a href="https://thesystemsthinker.com/behavior-over-time-diagrams-seeing-dynamic-interrelationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behaviour over time diagrams</a> are an excellent tool to build this model. Sometimes sketching things out, looking at it all together helps see the relationships. That’s what BOTDs are for.</p>

<h2 id="questions-to-answer">Questions to answer</h2>

<p>In both approaches, you’re trying to fill in some blanks. Here are some important questions to answer. They exist in every system.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure what some of them mean, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html">head over to seeing systems.</a></p>

<p>Find the driving factors</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What would happen if I do X?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Figure out the loop structure</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If I do more of a driving factor, <strong>d</strong>, what will happen?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Figure out delays in systems</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>How long before the results of changing <strong>d</strong> occur?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Identify the current dominant loop</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A second from now, towards which driving factor is the system going?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="system-archetypes">System Archetypes</h2>

<p>Some very common models come into play again and again. If you know these well, the problem switches from trying to figure out what is happening, to which model fits? - This is powerful and dangerous.</p>

<p>Dangerous because you get a tendency to beat the current situation into one of these models.</p>

<p>Powerful because you don’t have to start from scratch every time.</p>

<p>This is how <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-Simplistic-explanation-to-Mental-Models.html">Mental Models work</a>. They are archetypes for life.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_archetype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> has an excellent introduction to system archetypes.</p>

<p>To dive into available archetypes, <a href="https://thesystemsthinker.com/systems-archetypes-i-diagnosing-systemic-issues-and-designing-interventions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Systems Thinker is an excellent resource.</a></p>

<p>I haven’t explored archetypes enough, yet.</p>

<p>What I do know, is that the above archetype list is incomplete.</p>

<p>As Charlie Munger found out, sometimes it’s easier to look in an adjacent field than diving deeper in yours.</p>

<p>That’s what I’ll do.</p>

<p>Into Chemistry - equilibriums. Systems can be thought of as an equilibrium.</p>

<p>That’s when we can use results from chemical equilibrium to explain system behaviour. Presenting, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Chatelier%27s_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Le Chateliers Principle</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a settled system is disturbed, it will adjust to diminish the change that has been made to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- With computer models: the language is clearer - explicit and shows the underlying assumptions. -->

<p>This is precisely what Jay Forrester says happens in social systems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“At any time, a near-equilibrium exists affecting population mobility
between different areas of a country. To the extent that there is disequilibrium, it
means that some area is slightly more attractive than others and population begins
to move in the direction of the more attractive area. Movement continues until
rising population drives the more attractive area down in attractiveness to again
be in equilibrium with its surroundings. Other things being equal, an increase in
population of a city crowds housing, overloads job opportunities, causes
congestion, increases pollution, encourages crime, and reduces every component
of the quality of life.”<br>
- <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-988-system-dynamics-self-study-fall-1998-spring-1999/readings/behavior.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jay Forrester,  Counter intuitive behaviour of social systems</a></p>
</blockquote>

<!--

Efforts to improve some condition of a city will result primarily in increasing
population until other conditions deteriorate to reestablish an equilibrium.

Programs aimed at improving a city can
succeed only if they result in eventually raising the average quality of life for the
country as a whole.

Counter intuitive behaviour of social systems
1. Human intuition develops from exposure to simple systems. In simple systems,
the cause of a trouble is close in both time and space to symptoms of the trouble.
If one touches a hot stove, the burn occurs here and now; the cause is obvious.
However, in complex dynamic systems, causes are often far removed in both time
and space from the symptoms. True causes may lie far back in time and arise
from an entirely different part of the system from when and where the symptoms
occur. However, the complex system can mislead in devious ways by presenting
an apparent cause that meets the expectations derived from simple systems. A
person will observe what appear to be causes that lie close to the symptoms in
both time and space—shortly before in time and close to the symptoms.

For example, human suffering in cities is accompanied (some
think caused) by inadequate housing. As a result, housing is increased and
population rises to defeat the effort. More people are trapped in the depressed
urban system. As another example, symptoms of excess population are beginning
to overshadow all countries. 

2. social systems seem to have a few sensitive influence points
through which behavior can be changed. These high-influence points are not
where most people expect. Furthermore, when a high-influence policy is
identified, the chances are great that a person guided by intuition and judgment
will alter the system in the wrong direction. 

3. social systems exhibit a conflict between short-term and long-term
consequences of a policy change. A policy that produces improvement in the
short run is usually one that degrades a system in the long run. Likewise, policies
that produce long-run improvement may initially depress behavior of a system.
This is especially treacherous. The short run is more visible and more
compelling.
