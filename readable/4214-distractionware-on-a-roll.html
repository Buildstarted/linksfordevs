Happy new year!</p><center><big><b><u>Out with the old</u></b></big></center><p>Around this time every year, I clean up my blog sidebar, move old completed projects into <a href="http://distractionware.com/blog/older-games/">annual folders</a>, make room for new things. But last year, for the first time since I started this system in 2008, I didn’t finish any new games. In fact, the only other things I even worked on were <a href="http://statemachinegame.com/">State Machine</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/terrycavanagh/status/990334358170071040">a joke jam game</a>, which I didn’t finish.</p><p>I’m finding myself weirdly at peace about this. I guess I’m just not in a “small” game phase of my life right now? Maybe that’ll change again in future, but for now, I’m just really enjoying working on this big dumb dice game.</p><center><big><b><u>In with the new</u></b></big></center><p>In Dicey Dungeons news: we have a new update! <a href="http://diceydungeons.com/blog/2018/12/25/version-15.html">v0.15 came out on Christmas morning</a>, and it’s *massive*. It features the quest system, which is the big idea at the heart of the game that I’ve been so excited to finally share. It also showcases the new enemy AI (previously written about <a href="http://distractionware.com/blog/2018/12/how-enemy-ai-works-in-dicey-dungeons/">in detail here</a>), as well as a bunch of art, tech and design improvements. The whole team worked really hard on this one, and I’m really happy with how it’s turned out!</p><p>Finally, I’m incredibly proud our game is up for an <a href="http://igf.com/article/2019-independent-games-festival-reveals-years-finalists">IGF</a> this year, for Excellence in Design! We are, I think it’s fair to say, kind of a long shot – but it means a lot to me to even be in the running. I can’t even.</p><p>I still don’t know exactly when Dicey Dungeons is going to be finished, but we are into the final stages of development now, and things are starting to fall into place. Gonna be a very busy couple of months for us! Thank you for playing &lt;3</p></div></div></div></div>
