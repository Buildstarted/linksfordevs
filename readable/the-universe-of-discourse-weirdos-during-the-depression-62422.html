</p>

<p>Lately I've been rereading 
<em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>.
There's an episode in which the kids meet
Mr. Dolphus Raymond, who is drunk all the time, and who lives with his
black spouse and their mixed-race kids.  The ⸢respectable⸣ white folks won't
associate with him.  Scout and Jem see him ride into town so drunk he
can barely sit on his horse.  He is noted for always carrying around a
paper bag with a coke bottle filled with moonshine.</p>

<p>At one point Mr. Dolphus Raymond offers Dill a drink out of his coke
bottle, and Dill is surprised to discover that it actually contains Coke.</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond explains he is not actually a drunk, he only pretends to be
one so that the ⸢respectable⸣ people will write him off, stay off his back
about his black spouse and kids, and leave him alone.  If they think
it's because he's an alcoholic they can fit it into their worldview and
let it go, which they wouldn't do if they suspected the truth, which
is that it's his choice.</p>





<p>There's a whole chapter in <em>Cannery Row</em> on the same theme! Doc has a
beard, and people are always asking him why he has a beard.  Doc
learned a long time ago that it makes people angry and suspicious if
he tells the truth, which is he has a beard because he likes having a
beard.  So he's in the habit of explaining that the beard covers up an
ugly scar.  Then people are okay with it and even sympathetic.  (There
is no scar.)</p>

<p>Doc has a whim to try drinking a beer milkshake, and when he orders
one the waitress is suspicious and wary until he explains to her that
he has a stomach ulcer, and his doctor has ordered him to drink beer
milkshakes daily.  Then she is sympathetic.  She says it's a shame
about the ulcer, and gets him the milkshake, instead of kicking him
out for being a weirdo.</p>

<p>Both books are set at the same time.  <em>Cannery Row</em> was published in
1945 but is set during the Depression; <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> was
published in 1960, and its main events take place in 1935.</p>

<p>I think it must be a lot easier to be a weird misfit now than it was
in 1935.</p>
