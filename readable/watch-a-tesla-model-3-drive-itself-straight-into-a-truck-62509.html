<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-reactid=".1fsjpa1hrsw.5.$=10.0.0.8.0"><p>Footage of a <strong>bizarre crash</strong> on a Taiwanese highway has captured a Tesla Model 3 driver inexplicably crash head-on into an overturned truck.</p>
<p>The clip was first seen by Twitter users who were quick to ponder what actually went down – whether the driver was paying attention, whether Tesla’s <a href="https://www.whichcar.com.au/news/tesla-shoulders-some-of-the-blame-for-fatal-autopilot-crash">Autopilot</a> system was running or if something happened to the driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://d3lp4xedbqa8a5.cloudfront.net/s3/digital-cougar-assets/whichcar/2020/06/02/Misc/https___api.thedrive.com_wp-content_uploads_2020_06_20200601-Tesla-Model-3-Crash-Hero.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://d3lp4xedbqa8a5.cloudfront.net/s3/digital-cougar-assets/whichcar/2020/06/02/Misc/https___api.thedrive.com_wp-content_uploads_2020_06_20200601-Tesla-Model-3-Crash-Hero.jpg"></p>
<p>Turns out the Tesla driver allegedly just expected his <a href="https://www.whichcar.com.au/events/coty/meet-the-wheels-coty-2020-finalists-tesla-model-3">Model 3</a> to take care of the situation for him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/asoc/202006010318.aspx" target="_blank">CNA</a><a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/asoc/202006010318.aspx">.com.tw</a>, the driver of the overturned truck was forced to swerve to avoid a slowed car in front and ended up losing control which flipped the truck onto its side right in the fastest lane of the highway.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, along comes the Tesla Model 3 unfazed by the truck driver standing perilously close to danger and seemingly ignorant of the massive overturned truck blocking the lane.</p>
<p><img src="https://d3lp4xedbqa8a5.cloudfront.net/s3/digital-cougar-assets/whichcar/2020/06/02/Misc/Tesla-Model-3-Autopilot-crash-highway.jpg" alt="tesla model 3 autopilot crash" data-src="https://d3lp4xedbqa8a5.cloudfront.net/s3/digital-cougar-assets/whichcar/2020/06/02/Misc/Tesla-Model-3-Autopilot-crash-highway.jpg"></p>
<p>The driver of the Tesla was, amazingly, unharmed, which is surprising given the intensity of the crash that saw the truck shunted a number of metres forward, and the Tesla itself embedded into the load area of the truck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A loosely-translated CNA report says that he had Tesla’s Autopilot on and locked to 110km/h, though the system is not directly referenced in the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“He thought that the car itself would detect the obstacle and automatically brake, but he was surprised that the car did not slow down,” the article says.</p>
<p>It’s not the first time that motorists have over-relied on a Tesla’s ability to drive itself, with a US man dying as a result of a <a href="https://www.whichcar.com.au/news/tesla-shoulders-some-of-the-blame-for-fatal-autopilot-crash">crash partly attiributed to Tesla’s Autopilot</a>.</p>
<p>The two incidents are actually eerily similar, with the US accident also involving a large truck with a white side - the same view that confronted our Taiwanese friend in his Model 3.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, genuine level-four or five autonomous cars do not exist yet - <a href="https://www.whichcar.com.au/car-news/driverless-cars-are-decades-away-says-audi">and may never </a>- and full attention should be paid when operating a Tesla, just as you would in any other car.</p>
