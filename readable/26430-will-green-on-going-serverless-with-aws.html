<p>Kevin and Jon talk with Will Green (<a href="https://twitter.com/hotgazpacho">@hotgazpacho</a>) about how his small team uses serverless development on the AWS platform to maximize their productivity.</p>
<p>Topics:</p>
<ul><li>(00:20) Will&#x2019;s team builds the <a href="https://fireeye.market/">FireEye Market</a>, which enables you to &#x201C;discover apps, extensions, and add-ons that integrate with and extend your FireEye experience.&#x201D;</li><li>(02:51) FireEye is a relatively large company, but Will&#x2019;s team is just four people, and they&#x2019;re using serverless development to scale and get a lot done quickly. The FireEye Market is a greenfield development project. It&#x2019;s primarily a single page application that uses GraphQL. When new apps are published, an external provider pings webhooks that kick off background process that cache binaries, notify consumers, etc.</li><li>(07:05) Kevin asks about what pushed their team towards serverless technology. Will talks about how serverless lets them maximize the time they devote to delivering business value.</li><li>(08:30) Will talks about how they were able to successfully pitch the project internally. While there were some additional costs as they scaled up, they&#x2019;ve also been able to take advantage of new AWS services that allow them to scale on demand, which has led to savings.</li><li>(11:10) Jon asks for more clarification of what <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/">Apollo GraphQL</a>&#x2018;s role in their architecture. </li><li>(12:38) Kevin asks about the learning curve. Will says a lot of it was pretty natural since the team already had a Node background, but learning things like cold start took some work.</li><li>(14:25) They used the <a href="https://serverless.com/">serverless</a> framework, which helped take care of setting up tedious infrastructure. If they were starting today, they&#x2019;d seriously look at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/">AWS Amplify</a>, which is a lot more feature rich and includes support for CI/CD.</li><li>(15:50) Jon asks how they handle failures, including both code errors and service outages.</li><li>(19:49) Kevin asks about concerns with vendor lock-in. Will explains why he prefers to just pick a cloud vendor and learn it.</li><li>(20:49) Kevin asks how they manage the complexity of many small services interacting; Will talks about the use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/">AWS Step Functions</a> to manage state and workflow, and keeping updated diagrams really helps. </li><li>(22:40) Kevin asks about the local vs. cloud development experience. Will talks about some local development emulators from the community, but it&#x2019;s not quite the same as actually hitting the real service.</li><li>(24:00) Kevin asks about the testing strategy.</li><li>(25:15) Jon asks how things work with version control. Will explains how <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/">AWS CodeBuild</a> handles git push build and deploy for them.</li><li>(26:00) Jon asks how Will keeps up with all the different AWS services, especially since many aren&#x2019;t intuitively named. Will defines all the different services they&#x2019;re using.</li><li>(28:48) Will describes his bias against containers: you still have to worry about the underlying operating system, whereas with serverless that&#x2019;s all abstracted away.</li><li>(30:00) Will explains how they designed the system, starting with diagrams on <a href="https://www.draw.io/">draw.io</a>, continuing to work through requirements, and evolving the system.</li><li>(31:52) Will explains what&#x2019;s different about working with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DyanmoDB</a>. There&#x2019;s a lot, especially access patterns.</li><li>(36:03) Jon asks how they handle versioning multiple services and data changes; Will talks about using Step Functions and handling data failures.</li><li>(38:25) Jon asks for advice for people who are getting started with serverless on AWS, and Will highly recommends <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/">AWS Amplify</a>. There are lots of samples for serverless framework.</li><li>(40:39) Kevin asks if it&#x2019;s possible to migrate an existing application to a serverless architecture. Will says it&#x2019;s challenging, but you can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">CloudFront</a> as a router to start distributing work to serverless services based on URL path segmentation. </li><li>(41:50) Kevin asks about the experience of moving from Ruby development to JavaScript development.</li><li>(42:40) Will&#x2019;s team is hiring right now, here&#x2019;s the job listing: <a href="https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/FireEyeInc1/743999688840667-senior-developer-us-remote-prefer-eastern-time-zone-?trid=162ef3c2-cdcc-47a9-8327-c69d95269302">Senior Developer (US Remote &#x2013; Prefer Eastern Time Zone)</a>.</li></ul> </div> </article>
