            <p>While families' cats and dogs are <a href="https://time.com/5802459/work-from-home-pets/">enjoying the upside</a> of spending days with their owners working from home during the coronavirus shutdown, wild coyotes in San Francisco are reportedly also taking advantage of the benefits of a suddenly empty city.</p>

    <!-- text -->
            <p>There have been several recent fake stories circulating about unusual wildlife showing up in cities during the global pandemic, including news from Italy of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/03/coronavirus-pandemic-fake-animal-viral-social-media-posts/">dolphins swimming in the historic canals of Venice</a> and a gang of happy drunk elephants in the Yunnan province of China that was also<a href="https://www.indy100.com/article/drunk-elephants-china-corn-yunan-province-9414431"> debunked.</a> A surge in coyotes wandering the streets of San Francisco is a little less far-fetched.</p>

                    <!-- text -->
            <p>There has been an increase in coyotes in the city over recent years. In February <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11799871/bay-curious-coyotes">KQED reported</a> that they were thought to be recolonizing the places they used to inhabit abundantly after being nearly wiped out through poisoning and hunting from the '40s onwards. After years of zero sightings in San Francisco, a coyote was seen in the Presidio in 2002, thought to have been brought over from a trapper in the North Bay or possibly even making its way alone over the Golden Gate Bridge. Since then numbers have continued to rise.</p>

            <p>Jane, an SFGate reader, spotted coyotes this week at Twin Peaks and told us that she's, "never seen one at Twin Peaks (and I've literally been there hundreds of times). I think they're feeling free to roam given the general lack of traffic."</p>

            <p>While anxious residents are eager to see the end of the stay-at-home order, after waiting in the wings, our wild canine friends are apparently making the most of their opportunity to claim back the city.</p>
