            <p>I answered a question on stackoverflow that started to turn into a brain dump of the debugging techniques we've learnt while building this brand new stack. While everything is still evolving, here's that answer reposted here as a blog post (slightly modified).

Incompatibilities

Right now, living on the bleeding edge…</p>

            <p>Today we released ASP.NET vNext alpha3, you can read more about it here.

I want to point out some of the big changes in the KRuntime that weren't mentioned in the blog post.

NO MORE SOURCE FILES IN THE KPROJ FILE

Ok this, was mentioned in the above blog…</p>

            <p>Last time we spoke about assembly neutral interfaces and what they were. This post will describe how we implemented it in the ASP.NET vNext stack.

Today, types in the CLR must have an assembly name. That's an intrinsic piece of metadata that cannot be removed without CLR changes. While…</p>

            <p>If you look around the ASP.NET vNext code base, you'll see the [AssemblyNeutral] attribute on certain types. People have asked me what they were on Twitter and JabbR so I thought I'd write a blog post about it.

Loose coupling is something we strive for when developing software. We…</p>

            <p>In the last post I gave a brief introduction to ASP.NET vNext and the goals of the framework. This post will dive into more details on the overall architecture. 

This diagram shows the dependencies between the github repositories:



These aren't all of the dependencies but it's enough to get…</p>

            <p>For the past few months I've been working on what we're now calling ASP.NET vNext (don't worry I haven't forgotten about SignalR).

A better platform for building web applications with .NET

We took a look at some of the common problems  that exist in our ecosystem today, and took…</p>
