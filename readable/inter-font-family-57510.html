  Inter is offered as both traditional constant font files
  (one per style, e.g. Bold Italic, Medium, etc.) as well as a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_fonts">Variable Font</a>
  which contains all styles in a much smaller file size.
  Additionally, a variable font is ...variable! You can mix and match weight
  and italic angle as you please, forming theoretically infinite variations.

  <h2><a href="#story">The story behind Inter</a></h2>
  <div flow-cols="2" flow-cols-s="1">
    <p>
    Inter started out in late 2016 as an experiment to build a perfectly
    pixel-fitting font at a specific small size (11px.) The idea was that
    by crafting a font in a particular way, with a particular coordinate system
    (Units Per EM), and for a particular target rasterization size (11), it would
    be possible to get the best of both sharpness and readability.
    </p>
    <p>
    However after a few months of using an early version of Inter, it dawned
    on everyone exposed to the test that this approach had some serious real-world
    problems. Most notably that it was really hard to read longer text. Because of
    the pixel-aligning nature of that approach, the font took an almost
    <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/HPqDViSCB8fAWuxaV2ousFMv">mono-spaced appearance</a>,
    making it really easy to read numbers, punctuation and very short
    words, but eye-straining to read anything longer.
    </p>
    <p>
    The project was rebooted with a different approach, sticking with the
    specific UPM, but crafting glyphs and kerning in a way that made for
    more variation in the rhythm and smoother vertical and horizontal stems.
    As Inter was being developed, it was tested on an internal version of
    <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>â€”where the author of Inter works as a designerâ€”and slowly improved upon based on experience and feedback.

      <h4 id="faq-using-features"><a href="#faq-using-features">
        How do I enable and disable font features?
      </a></h4>
      In web browsers you'll want to use
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings"><q>font-feature-settings</q></a>.
      In Figma you can access features via the
      <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/250-working-with-fonts#opentype">Advanced Type panel.</a>
      In Illustrator, Photoshop and friends, you can access features via the
      <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/special-characters.html#opentype_panel_overview">Characters and OpenType panels.</a>
      Sketch doesn't provide a UI for configuring font features, but there's
      <a href="https://sketchtalk.io/discussion/comment/1478/#Comment_1478">a workaround using macOS's native font UI.</a>

        What is the difference between hinted and unhinted fonts?
      </a></h4>
      The font files in the "hinted" folders have additional data in them
      for assisting
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearType">ClearType</a>,
      the text rasterizer used by Microsoft Windows (and some Linux distributions.)
      You want to use the "hinted" fonts only if you are targeting Windows users
      <em>and</em> prefer the different look of these "hinted" fonts.
      Additionally, hinting data makes the font files larger, so if you are
      using Inter on websites, the extra size of these files is another
      consideration to make.

      <h4 id="faq-cdn"><a href="#faq-cdn">
        How reliable are the fonts served from rsms.me/inter?
      </a></h4>
      rsms.me/inter is backed by GitHub's server network and distributed
      globally on the CloudFlare CDN, making usage of
      <q>https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css</q> and associated font
      files very reliable and fast throughout the world.

    <c>
      <h4 id="faq-contribute"><a href="#faq-contribute">
        Can I help with improving Inter?
      </a></h4>
      Yes you can! Inter is an open-source project, meaning the source
      codeâ€”or "source design" if you willâ€”that is used to build the font files
      <a href="https://github.com/rsms/inter">are freely available</a> to improve upon.
      Font making requires a fair bit of technical work and
      depending on what you'd like to do, some things might be more fun
      depending on your technical skills.
      The <a href="https://github.com/rsms/inter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">"Contributing" document</a> is a great place to start. The document outlines where
      you can have the biggest impact, how things are setup and how to get
      started.

        This website claims work started in 2016, but the git repository's log says it started later?
      </a></h4>
      Inter was developed in a private, internal git repository
      starting in November 2016, prior to being published on August 22, 2017.
      Between November 2016 and August 2017, there were
      <num>2â€†990â€†150</num> line edits made across 247 versions.
      The reason the public GitHub repository does not reflect this is the
      fact that the project was initially only internal at the company where
      the author works and had some sensitive information "checked in",
      like AWS server details and internal author identity in
      all commit messages. Maybe one day we can write an elaborate git
      filter-branch program and convert the old repository to make
      it public, but what would be the point of that?&nbsp; :â€”)

        The variable font renders poorly in Chrome
      </a></h4>
      There are some known issues with variable fonts in Chrome, in particular
      on Microsoft Windows. You may see an effect similar to "ink bleed" where shapes overlap, for instance where the vertical and horizontal stems meet in "+" or "t".
      On Windows you may in addition see incorrectly placed glyphs that looks like poor kerning (spacing between characters) and even some glyphs being lower or taller than other glyphs.
      It is recommended to avoid using variable fonts on Chrome.
      See the <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=variable+component%3ABlink%3EFonts">Chromium bug tracker</a> for a list of variable-font related issues.
