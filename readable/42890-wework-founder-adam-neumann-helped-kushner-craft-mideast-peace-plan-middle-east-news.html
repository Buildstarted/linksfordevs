Last summer, some WeWork executives were shocked to discover Neumann was working on Jared Kushner’s Mideast peace effort. According to two sources, Neumann assigned WeWork’s director of development, Roni Bahar, to hire an advertising firm to produce a slick video for Kushner that would showcase what an economically transformed West Bank and Gaza would look like.”

                                                    </p><p class="t-body-text">Finally, an anecdote that <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-what-saudi-arabia-s-mbs-and-wework-s-adam-neumann-have-in-common-1.7883777">connected Neumann both to Kushner and the Saudi prince</a> involved a claim by Neumann that three people were going to save the world: Crown Prince Mohammed, Jared Kushner and Neumann himself.

Bush’s former national security adviser Stephen Hadley that everything could be worked out if bin Salman had the right mentor. Confused, Hadley asked who that person might be, according to a source familiar with the meeting. Neumann paused for a moment and said: ‘Me.’”
