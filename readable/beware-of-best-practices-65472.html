<p>As software engineers, our relationship with best practices is an evolving one. We start off unaware
of what they are. One day, because someone told us or because we read about it somewhere, we
discover them. This is usually where we start to revere them as some kind of holy scripture. The
cleaner our code gets, the more obsessed we become. For many of us, it can take a while before we
open our eyes again to the cold, hard truth: best practices are nothing but tools. Good tools, but
not always the most appropriate for the job.</p>

<p>Take DRY for example. Most may know its meaning<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, but how many wondered why it came to be? DRY is
the core principle the authors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer"><em>The Pragmatic
Programmer</em></a> came up with after years of
struggling with hard to maintain, entangled code bases. It is a <em>concrete solution</em> to a <em>concrete
problem</em>, and it involves abstraction, which also has drawbacks<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Best practices are in fact just that: experienced programmers’ solutions to recurrent problems,
stripped of their context and boiled down to an easy to remember, catchy phrase. They are not golden
rules, but <em>trade-offs</em>. They come with less drawbacks than advantages - they are <em>best</em> practices
after all - but it is no excuse to not weigh up their benefits and costs before adopting them.  And
for that, it is often necessary to go back to their origins, and understand the problem they were
trying to solve in the first place.</p>

<p>But if the real value of best practices lies in knowing their costs and benefits, why do we always
teach them in a simplified, dumbed-down form? Of course, the most obvious answer to that
question pertains to our brain’s limited storage space. It is easier to remember a three letter
acronym than a full explanatory paragraph! But I feel like our love for best practices is also
deeply anchored in our subconsciousness.</p>

<p>Developing software is a complex and mentally taxing task, that often involves spending hours
pondering over what choice to make. Worse yet, when we finally take a decision, we often do so with
doubt lingering in our minds: did we really chose the right thing? In contrast, best practices
seduce us with the promise of simplicity, stability and certainty. By blindly following them, we
leave the responsibility of making decisions to a greater authority (the people who came up with
said best practice) and assume the more relaxing role of simply applying pre-made rules<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.
Besides, because their formulation is so simple, best practices also easily translate into metrics.
We then turn those metrics into targets - another of our little weaknesses<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> - and reaching those
targets ultimately grants us what we are longing for: peace of mind (“I reached 100% test
coverage! My code must be safe!“). As we all know deep down, this is but a mirage. But this false
sense of security can make us dangerously complacent. Reaching 100% test coverage does <em>not</em>
guarantee that our code is bug free, and should not be an excuse to let our guard down!</p>

<p>Obviously, I am not saying best practices should not be followed. They are valuable advice from the
wise software engineers who came before us. But I do believe that we should always remember that
they are not absolute truths.</p>

chat about any of this, if you spotted any mistakes or typos, or if you’d like me to cover anything
else! Have a great day :)</p>
