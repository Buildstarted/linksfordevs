<p><span>I am happy to be able to announce Telerik UI for Blazor is officially out of the preview and experimental stage and now enters a new era: official RTM! <strong>Telerik UI for Blazor 1.0.0 is here!</strong></span></p>
<p>Itâ€™s crazy to think about how <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui" title="" target="">Telerik UI for Blazor</a> was in its initial preview <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/introducing-the-telerik-ui-for-blazor-early-preview" title="" target="">just a few months ago</a>. Now, after several releases, lots of feedback from Blazor fans, and huge steps for the Blazor framework itself, we are finally here to chat about this new official product in the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/devcraft" title="" target="">Telerik family</a> of UI component suites.</p>
<h2>Wait, What is this Blazor Thing?</h2>
<p><a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/client">Blazor</a> is an exciting new framework coming from Microsoft that takes advantage of <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> in order to allow developers to use C# to target web applications instead of using JavaScript.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s right, you heard me, you can now develop rich web applications using C# where you normally would use JavaScript! Obviously this is huge for many .NET developers out there.</p>
<p>This blog post isnâ€™t necessarily meant to give everyone a full 101 intro to Blazor, but keep the above in mind as you go through the rest of this blog post. If youâ€™re interested in knowing more about Blazor itself head over to the official Blazor page that I linked in the beginning of this section.</p>
<h2>How Telerik Approaches Blazor UI Components</h2>
<p>One thing Iâ€™d like to note about Telerik UI for Blazor is that we have decided to build these components from the ground up, making them completely native to the Blazor framework.</p>
<p>During our initial research into how we should approach a set of UI components for Blazor, we had two paths we could take: wrap existing JavaScript components (<a href="https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui" title="" target="">Kendo UI</a> specifically) or build up a new set of components from scratch. While wrapping would give us a quick win, essentially offering over 70 UI components from the get-go, we realized that we could quickly run into issues integrating with the Blazor framework itself, like working with validation, templates, and other items.</p>
<p>Our philosophy while building these components is to keep the JavaScript interops to a minimum. The strength of Blazor is to use C# rather than JavaScript after all. There will still be some interops needed here and there, but as I mentioned these will be kept to a minimum going forward.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-in-1.0.0">So, Whatâ€™s in 1.0.0?</h2>
<p>With the initial release of Telerik UI for Blazor we have the following <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui#Components" title="" target="">UI components</a> ready for you right out of the box.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Button</li>
    <li>Calendar</li>
    <li>Chart</li>
    <li>Date Input</li>
    <li>Date Picker</li>
    <li>DropDownList</li>
    <li>Grid</li>
    <li>Numeric Textbox</li>
    <li>TabStrip</li>
    <li>TextBox</li>
    <li>Window</li>
    <li>Animation Container</li>
</ul>
<p>Thatâ€™s a huge amount of components! With this list you can clearly already start developing pretty advanced applications using Blazor.</p>
<p>All of the input components can take advantage of Blazorâ€™s validation framework and thereâ€™s full support for templates across the board.</p>
<p>One of the heavier hitters here is obviously the <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/grid/overview" title="" target="">native Grid component</a>. Just as a quick highlight, here are the initial features we have managed to squeeze in to the Grid (with more to come of course).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Paging</li>
    <li>Sorting</li>
    <li>Filtering</li>
    <li>Show/Hide Columns</li>
    <li>Cell Templates</li>
    <li>In-cell Editing</li>
    <li>Inline editing</li>
    <li>Popup Editing</li>
    <li>Custom form for editing</li>
    <li>Custom editor (editor templates)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thereâ€™s just so much to showcase in the components that I canâ€™t put it all in a blog post, so instead I recommend heading over to the <a href="https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui/">demo site for Telerik UI for Blazor</a>. Quick note: this is actually a full Blazor app!</p>
<p>If youâ€™ve already been using Telerik UI for Blazor in its earlier iterations I recommend heading over to our <a href="https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/release-history/release-notes/blazor/ui-for-blazor-1-0-0">Whatâ€™s New in Telerik UI for Blazor 1.0.0 page</a>.</p>
<h2>ThemeBuilder Support</h2>
<p>Just like we have with all of our other web-based components, we have added Telerik UI for Blazor into the <a href="https://themebuilder.telerik.com/">ThemeBuilder</a> tool. This makes customizing any of the available themes extremely easy through just a couple of clicks. Any changes you make to the look-and-feel will automatically be updated in the list of components rendered on the page, which gives you immediate feedback around what your changes are doing to the components.</p>
<h2>Blazor Sample Application</h2>
<p>With this first release we have also created a sample application showcasing the  power of the Blazor framework - with Telerik UI for Blazor in charge of the UI components for said application. Since we have Grids, Charts, and Form elements as a part of 1.0.0, it makes a ton of sense to showcase these in a dashboard application. So, if youâ€™re interested in seeing a Blazor app in action head on over to the <a href="https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-dashboard-app/">Telerik UI for Blazor Dashboard Sample application</a>.</p>
