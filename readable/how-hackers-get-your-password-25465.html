<p>It‚Äôs not a secret anymore, Hackers know our passwords. &nbsp;<strong>551,509,767</strong> real-world passwords previously exposed in data breaches. <strong>Are you one of those victims</strong>? Has your email been compromised or found in a data breach so far? <strong>How do hackers get your passwords</strong>? In this article, I am going to write the common methods which hackers use to steal your passwords and then I will recommend you the industry<strong> best practices to keep you or at least your passwords safe üòä </strong></p>



<h4><strong>Mass Theft
</strong></h4>



<p>This is the most convenient way for hackers, instead of hacking 10.000 people, <strong>they hack a vulnerable web site</strong>, which has all the information they need. Yes, I know this sounds hard but in reality, it‚Äôs not.<em> Just recently (3 April 2019)</em> more than<strong> 540 million records </strong>which included extensive details, including people‚Äôs comments, likes, names, and Facebook IDs were found in Amazon unprotected. (plain text) (You can Read <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275837/facebook-plain-text-password-storage-hundreds-millions-users" target="_blank">here</a> the details )</p>



<p>Hackers can also steal ‚Äú<strong>hashes</strong>‚Äù, like in 2012, <strong>LinkedIn</strong> was saving their user database <strong>unsalted, </strong>which means ‚Äúa random data was not used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. <strong>Salting in cryptography is used to safeguard passwords; </strong>keeping it short they had no extra safeguard implemented to protect the passwords) </p>



<h4><strong>Brute Force</strong></h4>



<p>Hackers can use tools that can crack your password b<strong>y simply entering different passwords over and ove</strong>r until it‚Äôs cracked (<strong>unless you have account lockout or MFA</strong>) ; Depending on the password complexity &nbsp;most passwords can be cracked very fast, as<strong> 123456 </strong>is still a very common password the time which is required to crack <strong>(0.02 seconds</strong>) this password is very very low compared <strong>P$45w@rd_?!.) &nbsp;¬£4&lt;*aL^</strong> &nbsp;(<strong>198 years </strong>depending on the resources available for the attack )</p>



<h4><strong>Phishing ‚Äì
Social Engineering</strong></h4>



<p><strong>A hacker will send a login page for the account they aim to steal from you</strong>, which can be Facebook, Online Banking web site, Outlook, etc. They will try to make you believe that your account is under danger, to be safe click on the ‚Äú<strong>provided</strong>‚Äù URL‚Äôs, which is fake of course, but the victim will not notice that and enter their details‚Ä¶</p>



<h4><strong>Malware Attacks</strong></h4>



<p>Below are some examples for Malware
attacks, out of many different Malware attack types </p>



<h4><strong>Keylogger</strong></h4>



<p>A basic tool&nbsp;to get your passwords. Keylogger resides in your system memory and runs secretly in the background, it <strong>logs every keystroke from your computer, and then sends the information back to the hacker.</strong></p>



<h4><strong>RAT</strong></h4>



<p>Remote Administration Tool , where<strong> a hacker can connect remotel</strong>y to any PC without any permission üòä </p>



<h2><strong>Trojan
Horse</strong></h2>



<p>Malware which lands to your PC‚Äôs through ‚Äú<strong>cracked software</strong>‚Äù through ‚Äú<strong>warez</strong>‚Äù web site.</p>



<h4><strong>WI-FI Sniffers</strong></h4>



<p>Once a hacker breaks into a Wi-Fi
network, unfortunately, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to detect a Wi-Fi sniffer
attack, which means they will be intercepting all of the data you communicate.<strong></strong></p>



<h4><strong>Recommendations</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Where
possible enable 2 Factor authentications</strong></li></ul>



<p>Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and many other popular websites do provide this service. You can download an Authenticator <strong>app, which can be in an app in your phone, or you set up to receive SMS</strong> to the provided phone number or email to a preferred e-mail address.</p>



<p>Based on a current study done by <strong>New York University and Google</strong>, simply adding a recovery phone number to your Account can block up to 100% of automated bots, 99% of bulk phishing attacks, and 66% of targeted attacks.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôve signed into your phone or set up a recovery phone number an SMS code sent to a recovery phone number helped <strong>block 100% of automated bots, 96% of bulk phishing attacks, and 76% of targeted</strong>.&nbsp;On-device prompts, a more secure replacement for <strong>SMS, helped prevent 100% of automated bots, 99% of bulk phishing attacks and 90% of targeted attacks.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Make sure to have an <strong>up-to-date Anti-Virus</strong> </li><li>Make sure to install a <strong>Firewall</strong> (or make sure your Windows Firewall is enabled)</li><li><strong>Never open suspicious attachments</strong> in emails even if they are from someone you know (they      might be a Vitim) <ul><li>When you need to open a link in an email, <strong>compare on what you see in the UR</strong>L and what actually the URL is (check the screenshot) or check that the web browser resolves the link properly. If, say, a ‚Äúwhatever.bank.com‚Äù link changes to ‚Äúsomethingelse.org,‚Äù exit the page immediately.</li></ul><ul><li>If you receive a message saying it‚Äôs from a person you know and asks for critical data, call the person on the number stored in your contacts (instead of calling the SMS number) and verify that he/she has requested the data.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Log off</strong> from the web sites once you are done using them. log back next time, can be a pain, but at least you‚Äôll know that no one else can steal your token and log in without your permission</li><li><strong>Try not to reuse the same password</strong>, the below image illustrates how a leaked password which is used multiple times can affect you. </li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Use biometrics</strong> like
Windows Helo, Apple Face ID, Samsung fingerprint where possible</li><li>Make sure you have a <strong>strong password</strong></li><li>Be aware of <strong>Social Engineering</strong> attacks. </li></ul>



<h4><strong>Password
Facts</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Many
people are using the same password across multiple sites.</li><li>Password theft is
increasing every year<strong></strong></li><li>‚ÄúSave my
password for future‚Äù use is still very commonly used<strong></strong></li><li>Easy passwords
are still very common<strong></strong></li></ul>



<h4><strong>Did they steal
your password? </strong></h4>



<p>If you are not sure if you are using a ‚Äú<strong>well known or a commonly used</strong> ‚Äù password, or if you are not sure if your password which You use to connect to a web site/service has been hacked before you can check <strong>Have I been Pwned</strong>‚Äù web site.</p>



<p>I am sure by now you know the World known expert &nbsp;<strong>Troy Hunt,</strong> if not here is your opportunity to learn about his great, free and useful web site</p>
