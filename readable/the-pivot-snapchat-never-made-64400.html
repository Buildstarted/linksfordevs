                    <p>Snapchat, to me, is one of the most amazing and underrated apps out there. Once upon a time, everyone thought Snapchat will overtake Facebook. That has not happened, however I won't count Snapchat out.</p><p>Snapchat started its life in September 2011 as a messaging app where the chats vanish. In October 2013 Snapchat added the "My Story" feature which allows users to add photos and videos (a.k.a snaps) in chronological order that can be viewed by their friends. This feature quickly became more popular than private messaging.</p><p>One of Snapchat's key ingredients is filters and lenses. The ability to add effects that beautify your snaps pre and post shots is one of the main reasons users love Snapchat. I know so many people who prefer to use Snapchat to take images and videos over the default camera app on their phones.</p><p>All your snaps are saved in Snapchat, however Snapchat does not backup your phone's images and videos. This, I believe, is Snapchat's missed opportunity. To explain this, I'll use another one of my favourite apps, Google Photos. If you do not use Google Photos, please stop reading this and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/y2mM">download</a> Google Photos now. You'll thank me later.</p><p>Google Photos backs up all your photos and videos for free. But that isn't what makes it special. It has the most intelligent search and organisation. You can search with names of things and locations. It recognises people in your photos and automatically creates albums for them. You can do cool stuff like create a shared album with your spouse that automatically adds images of your kids from both of your devices. Google Photos is a heavily underrated app, but that is what Snapchat can take advantage of.</p><p>Snapchat should copy Google Photo's core functionality and tweak their camera to be more of a point and shooter like the default camera app is. I'm sure the product guys at Snapchat are way smarter than me and can figure out the implementation, but this feature set will increase Snapchat's usefulness immensely.</p><p>A lot of people open Snapchat everyday to take a snap they do not send. They just want to use Snapchat's camera. I see Snapchat's camera as a next generation camera app. It should be able to backup those images and enhance their access. Those images are also part of our story.</p>
