<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The sun comes up, itâ€™s morning on the square
<br>
The silver girl is waking up for a long day at the fair
<br>
Rolling out her costume, she shuffles into town
<br>
And the children gather round, throwing pennies, throwing pounds
<br>
Since the curtain fell, on the circus of the sun
<br>
Sheâ€™s living in Salt Hill, in a blue Westphalia â€™81
</p><p>


Mary plays a teardrop, a teardrop mandolin
<br>
Her band waits at the border, for the man to let â€˜em in
<br>
Piper he was finished, and about to pack it in
<br>
He heard a rattle in his tin, it was Mary threw it in
<br>
Saying â€˜hereâ€™s one for the busker, he could use a friendâ€™
<br>
â€˜It takes one to know one, we should start a bandâ€™
</p><p>


One for the busker, and one for the band
<br>
One for the piper with his pockets full of sand
<br>
One Hari-Krishna, a drum in his hand
<br>
Whisper on willow, lone willow tree
<br>
And see the bright dream does not vanish
</p><p>


The sun is high, high above the square
<br>
Sam slept in â€™til noon, thereâ€™s no room anywhere
<br>
He goes to the seaside, and walks the promenade
<br>
And he fell in time with the second line, of a Dixieland parade
<br>
Behind the blues man, and the buccaneers, and yogi on his chin
<br>
Silver says â€˜over here, my show is about to beginâ€™
</p><p>


One for the busker, and one for the band
<br>
Sing us Hallelujah on the Takamine tan
<br>
One in the bunkhouse, one out in the van
<br>
Whisper on willow, lone willow tree
<br>
And see the bright dream does not vanish
</p><p>


The lights come up above the stage
<br>
And weâ€™re all down in the old town with our pockets full of change
<br>
Maryâ€™s band is playing hand-me-downs
<br>
Until itâ€™s last call for the road, we all have another round
<br>
And Sam sleeps solitarily, beneath the bright moonbeams
<br>
Piper sleeps with Mary, but the silver girl is with him in his dreams
</p><p>


One for the busker, and one for the band
<br>
One for all, and everyone, a quarter in the can
<br>
One for the new kid, better watch out old man
<br>
Whisper on willow, lone willow tree
<br>
And see the bright dream does not vanish</p></div></div></div>
