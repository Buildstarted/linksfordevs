It's water resistant to 50 meters, and if you're after the complete package, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/11/sony-ces-2019-interview-aibo/">Sony</a> has also developed five matching watch faces with mechanical, solar and quartz movements.</p><p><img alt="Wena Wrist" data-caption="Sony's Wena Wrist is now available for pre-order in the UK" data-credit="Sony" data-mep="3027697" src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=741%2C358%2C84%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=1600%2C773&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-02%2Fd97b2440-2f86-11e9-ade3-0351216bb9f1&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=ed0de42ce132b77f9ef89e5ac68e9501bc4196ea"></p><p>And that is essentially it. Compared to an Apple Watch -- or even a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/09/fitbit-inspire-fitness-tracker/">Fitbit</a> -- its functionality is seriously limited, which makes its price tag hard to swallow: the straps and watch heads range in price from £100 to £400, for which you could comfortably purchase the aforementioned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/19/apple-watch-series-4-preview/">Apple Watch</a>.</p><p>However, the Wena Wrist will undoubtedly be attractive to horologists looking to enjoy some of the usefulness of wearables while maintaining a traditional aesthetic. And to hipsters that like to wax lyrical about the merits of staying disconnected (while still staying a bit connected). Perhaps if the straps had been priced more affordably they'd have wider-spread appeal, or conversely, if Sony had packed in more functionality, it might have given the company a good foothold in the luxury market -- something it's toyed with since it stopped building watches for Google's Wear OS. </p></div></div></div></div>
