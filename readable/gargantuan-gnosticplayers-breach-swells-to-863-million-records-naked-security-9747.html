		<p>A hacker using the identity â€˜Gnosticplayersâ€™ has topped up one of the largest data breaches ever publicised by offering for sale 26 million records stolen from another six online companies.</p>
<p>The first of four data caches came to light in early February when The Register <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/" rel="nofollow">got wind</a> that a database of 617 million records pilfered from 16 companies had been put up for sale on the Dark Web for $20,000.</p>
<p>Days later, Gnosticplayers added another 127 million records from a further eight websites, before adding a third round on 17 February comprising another 93 million from a further eight sites.</p>
<h2>Round 4</h2>
<p>The fourth round, posted to Dark Web market Dream Marketplace last weekend brings the total number of hacked records to 863 million from 38 sites.</p>
<p>The data at risk varies by site but reportedly includes email address, usernames, IP addresses, and in some cases, personal details, settings and in one case, phone numbers.</p>
<p>Passwords are also at risk with a variety of hashing algorithms used to secure them, including SHA1 (with and without salting), SHA256, SHA512 (with salting), and in the case of LifeBear, MD5.</p>
<p>Naked Security was unable to independently confirm the victims, but <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/round-4-hacker-returns-and-puts-26mil-user-records-for-sale-on-the-dark-web/" rel="nofollow">ZDNet</a>&nbsp;has named the sites in the latest round as Bukalapak (13 million records) GameSalad (1.5 million), Estante Virtual (5.4 million), Coubic (1.5 million), LifeBear (3.8 million), Youthmanual.com (1.1 million).</p>
<p>Japanese site LifeBear was contacted by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHackersNews/status/1107609236748554240" rel="nofollow">another news site</a> which received the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We currently have been investigating the situation. We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause. We already have made contact with police department in Japan and a lawyer to consult this situation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Two things stand out about these breaches, the first being that few of the companies seemed to be aware theyâ€™d been breached until contacted for confirmation by journalists.</p>
<p>A second is the sheer number of breached companies the hackers were able to break into over a period of months.</p>
<p>The first round of breached data <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/02/15/photography-site-500px-resets-14-8-million-passwords-after-data-breach/">included photography site 500px</a>, which later said the data had been taken from its servers around 5 July 2018. According to ZDNet, five of the six companies in the latest cache data appear to have been breached as recently as last month.</p>
<p>According to the same report, allegedly, other victims were saved from being named because they agreed to pay an extortion ransom to keep it private.</p>
<h2>What to do</h2>
<p>Hereâ€™s the list of sites previously known to have been breached as part of the Gnosticplayers leak (in addition to those from the latest cache mentioned above):</p>
<p>500px, Dubsmash, MyFitnessPal, MyHeritage, ShareThis, HauteLook, Animoto, EyeEm, 8fit, Whitepages, Fotolog, Armor Games, BookMate, CoffeeMeetsBagel, Artsy, DataCamp, Xigo, YouNow, Houzz, Ge.tt, Coinmama, Roll20, Stronghold Kingdoms, PetFlow, Legendas.tv, Jobandtalent, Onebip, StoryBird, StreetEasy, GfyCat, ClassPass, Pizap.</p>
<p>Anyone who has an account with any of these sites should change their password as soon as possible, regardless of whether theyâ€™ve been asked to do so. If two-factor authentication (2FA) is offered, turn it on.</p>
