I personally don't care about that to be honest. While it would certainly be nice to be able to produce small single native binaries for simple CLI tools, in my opinion what CoreRT currently outputs is already acceptable although certainly not perfect.</p><p>What is a bit discouraging about all of this is that it seems there's still too much focus on the web. I think .NET is already a very established and competitive technology there, and I'm not sure whether investing so much on it would change that dramatically, although maybe that's where the financial returns are, I don't know. The vast majority of the C# developers and jobs seem to be related to that (ASP.NET and such).</p><p>I would like to see a more diverse user base. For realtime applications for example, besides some XNA diehards (MG/FNA/UV) and Unity there's not much going on<code>*</code>. I suspect that with a fraction of the effort being spent on the web stuff .NET could become substantially more attractive to people doing realtime applications like game/simulations/etc. The new lower-level language features introduced since C# 7 helped a lot, but overall there's still a 'server-grade tech' feel to .NET, what could be remedied with AOT and for realtime applications a more suitable GC too. (I'm talking about objective stuff like requiring runtime environments and JIT/GC pauses)</p><p>I'm a game developer and it's widely known that the vast majority of us aren't happy with any language we have so far. I'm pretty sure that's very evident if you have contact with other game developers on social media. <a class="user-mention" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/RUSshy/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/RUSshy">@RUSshy</a> knows that very well. I personally picked C# because I like the language a lot and things like the "local GC" and CoreRT gave me hope for the future, but I can't really blame my fellow developers who frown upon .NET.</p><p>Anyway, I just think that if MS could focus just a little bit more on those issues I mentioned, I'm pretty sure there's a lot of users who would be happy to switch to .NET. It's obvious .NET isn't popular for realtime application development (as it could be), and diversifying the user base is a good thing! However, judging by what happened to XNA it seems that's not a concern, and that makes me a bit wary about the future.</p><p>As I said though, CoreRT has been serving me well and I'm planning to continue using it. This is a fantastic project and I'm happy to hear it's not 'dying' as that tweet suggests. I would like to see more focus on the features that matter to me and I feel very underrepresented in the .NET scene. But then again, as I said the money is probably elsewhere (web/LOB) so I can't really complain.</p><p><code>*</code> there are incredible projects like <a class="user-mention" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/mellinoe/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/mellinoe">@mellinoe</a>'s repos, I don't want to be unfair here, but overall it's clear that there was a huge decline since XNA was discontinued.</p></div></div></div></div>
