            I have a chat with Troy Hunt, creator of Have I Been Pwned about developing your personal brand. Troy's answers to my questions can be related to anyone who is a public figure, even if it's a fraction of what Troy does such as blog or Twitter comments.

Note: this chat was done over Skype for Business and is raw footage. I was using WIFI from the Portugal AirBnB I was staying in at the time and the first couple of minutes are not the greatest video quality for some reason. Sometimes it is a bit laggy. It is fine to listen to and have it play in the background while you multitask

Questions asked

02:33 - What worked and what did not work for you along the way?

05:33 - Tall Poppy syndrome exists

10:56 - When you're well known, people may consider you or anyone else who has a high public profile as a celebrity. How do you remain intact in producing quality content to ensure that you are who you are, in terms of your knowledge and strengths and not just seen as a public celebrity

16:25 - When you're writing your content do you endeavour to keep to a schedule or do you write whatever comes into your mind or what's happening during that week

19:36 - With the content that you produce do you ever think about how to make it stand out or how to make it unique? As you know there's a lot of content that's getting written every week and there's more people out there who are starting blogs because technology in all fields is constantly evolving. Is it something you ever worry about it or you just shut it out and just mind your own content, and not worry about anyone else

22:06 - For content that was previously relevant at the time, let's say you wrote a blog post five years ago and now because of the evolving technology that's taking place, would you go back and revisit it, would you leave it as-is or would you write a new blog post to expand on it? To outline what has since changed or why it would not work or apply anymore to this day?

23:55 - Have you ever been called out by the 1% on something that you've written about in the past that's not relevant anymore? Has anyone in the last couple of years have been like - Hey Troy, by the way this thing you wrote back then is completely wrong 

25:06 - If you were the CEO or person in charge of LinkedIn, what would you do for a week in terms of changing it?
