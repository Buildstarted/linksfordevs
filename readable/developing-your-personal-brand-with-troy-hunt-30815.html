            I have a chat with Troy Hunt, creator of Have I Been Pwned about developing your personal brand. Troy's answers to my questions can be related to anyone who is a public figure, even if it's a fraction of what Troy does such as blog or Twitter comments.

Note: this chat was done over Skype for Business and is raw footage. I was using WIFI from the Portugal AirBnB I was staying in at the time and the first couple of minutes are not the greatest video quality for some reason. Sometimes it is a bit laggy. It is fine to listen to and have it play in the background while you multitask
