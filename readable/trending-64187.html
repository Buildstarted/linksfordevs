        If you could, how would you personally improve the UX of this site?
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        So far i'm impressed by the UX. I'd like to be able to see more context (original post + replies) in the search section. The replies on their own don't mean much without the context.
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        Maybe a way to like things?
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        I honestly like it so far. I don't use social media beyond lurking on Reddit, but so far it's simple enough for me to like using for commenting and posting. Though, replying gets a little confusing for me. Also, I noticed that one post in Trending has a lot of comments. It'd be cool to be able to collapse the big chunk of comments.
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        I'd like to be able to collapse threads.
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        Being able to collapse or mark top-level threads as read
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        I hate to pile on with the same answers others are given but the minimalist approach is definitely the way to go and making all sections of the threads independently collapsable would go a very long way.
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        collapse threads, center content like twitter so I don't have to slightly turn my head, simplify navigation (notifications don't need to be separated and are very noisy), also what does the green dot do?
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        1. allow line breaks in replies with a shortcut (ctrl-return?). 2. add an actual submit button to replies. It's unclear that entering will submit the reply versus add a new line. 3. larger font
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        Updating it to be a bit more efficient in terms of use space on desktop. Consolidating "trends" like Twitter when there's enough traffic.
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        the ability to change text size? the site does work well even if i set zoom level to 120% but the default text is too small on my screen
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        I don't like having to click in to reply, all the back button is a bit strange after i've jumped into a thread to reply to it.
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        to not have this be the highest ranking topic. but nice work on the site - I do love to see people doing social media startups.
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        Some kind of limited markdown support
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        Sounds silly, but I don't understand how the "replies" function works at all. I'll see a thread with something like "8 replies", and when I click it, I expect the replies to drop down under it in a clear hiearchy. They don't seem to do that, and I don't see the number of replies that the link indicates.
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        I would open up the design a little. Like this : <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xkgbcp5xcxibmkz/Screenshot%202020-07-12%2023.45.42.png?dl=0" rel="external nofollow">dropbox.com/s/xkgb...</a> and collapse threads.
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        Does the feed max out? Or is that the amount of content on here so far?
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        Introduce a minimum word count for replies maybe (~24 characters)?
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        
    
</div>
            
        
            
                <div>
    
    <p>
        there's definitely something addicting about this small social network. it may be the minimalist approach, but what else?
    </p>

        it resembles old chat rooms/irc channels in some way. there is no rat chase, at least now. i wonder if this will stay a thing. now we just blabber about 'things', mostly to test platform, but I'd like it to stay more like blabber, less like 'look at this content guys' if blabber can keep quality
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        I think *right now* is the exciting time period where the platform is gaining popularity, there aren't any expectations, and everybody on is pleasant to talk to. Hopefully this lasts!
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>

        I definitely like it so far.

        Wish I could turn back time to the good old days of Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Currently on macOS Catalina and not very happy with how buggy it was for the first few months (MONTHS!) after its official release. I played with Ubuntu LTS in a VM for a while and that was an even bigger bugfest so I went crawling back. I'd honestly dump my Mac for an iPad Pro if it ever got clang + Docker but that will never happen :(

        I use macOS and iOS on a regular basis. Partly habit--I've been an Apple person for thirty years--and partly because I think they're easier to use and they just look better.

        I use ubuntu for my desktop, where I do recreational programming and web browsing. OSX on my personal MacBook where I do recreational programming and web browsing in bed, and on my work laptop. Android on my Pixel 2 XL where I text and tweet.

        Please reply if you or someone you know has had Covid19, with their age and outcome. Hoping this will compensate for the fact that most people don't know a victim. I'll start: an aquaintance around 50 years old was very ill, on a vent for 2 weeks, but survived.

        i have it rn, i am under the age of 21, i knew ppl in their 20s, 40s, and 60s who had it. they all survived, and didn't even get too tired, just like the normal amount. people make it out to be worse than it actually is. like it should be taken seriously, but there is no need to scare others or be scared.

        What do you recommend, Vim, Sublime Text or VS Code for a newbie? I used to recommed VS Code, but everyone I recommend complained about, how slow it was than Sublime Text.
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        vs code hands down, and atom otherwise. if you're new, you don't need to be dropping $$ for a text editor imo. VIM after that.
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        I still like VS Code, to be honest, though I haven't used ST for a while so perhaps I don't remember/know how much faster ST is?
    </p>
    
</div>
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        `VS Code` to run a project. `Vim` plugin in `VS Code` to edit text.

        This sure has a really cool feel to it and I hope it gets a little more popular, but not too popular.

        I want to learn one of these (Rust, Nim, Go) modern programming languages which are close/equivalent to C/C++ performance. I understand that Go got much better ecosystems, I mean, the libraries, but heard that Rust is better than Go in terms of better type safety and less chance of getting runtime exceptions. Nim also exists for a while and it is not known to many of us! Wondering which one to be best general purpose programming language - Go, Nim and Rust?
    </p>

<div>
    
        
    
        <div>
    
    <p>
        i'd go with go, syntactically more straightforward and pretty widely used across domains. No wrong answer though
