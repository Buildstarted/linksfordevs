If you’ve used the assistant on your phone or seen the way your camera can take pictures in the dark then you’ve seen Machine Learning in practice. Big Data is all about how to quickly process and analyze huge datasets using the power of the cloud. Companies spend years accumulating data about everything, and Big Data helps those companies gain insights and understanding from all that data. For example, a large shopping company knowing what sorts of things people buy when storms are coming so that they can pre-stock more of it before customers rush to purchase essentials.</span></p><p><span>Machine Learning and Big Data are being used to revolutionize entire industries and we are empowering the millions of .NET developers worldwide to use ML in any of their applications. You would be PM lead of a collaborative and high-trust team, passionate about their mission of democratizing machine learning and letting .NET developers use the existing knowledge and tools they love with ML and BigData. The team will be bringing amazing tools that are easy to use and focus on getting developers as productive as possible as fast as possible in a highly complicated area, and only be exposed to the complexity as needed. Making machine learning and Big Data available to all developers, everywhere, on any platform.</span></p><p><span>Microsoft’s Developer Division (“DevDiv”) is chartered with empowering every developer and every development team on the planet to build great software faster. The .NET team within DevDiv does that by building the .NET development platform for building apps of any type, for any OS. Millions of developers worldwide use .NET in their job and as a .NET PM you would help define the APIs, Tools, and end-to-end experiences that make .NET loved by so many developers.</span></p></div><div data-ph-id="ph-view1-external-1582559678773-ph-job-details-v1e39swx-FlWGYz">
