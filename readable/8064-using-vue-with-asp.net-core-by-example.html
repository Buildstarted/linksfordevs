</p><p>Creating large, monolithic SPAs is all the rage, but not all solutions need a single page application. I found that improving parts of my web projects with islands of functionality was better in many cases, but the complexity of Angular and my hatred of .jsx made me yearn for a modern framework that is simple and straightforward. Thatâ€™s where Vue came in and saved the day.
</p><p>Vue is a scalable framework that is used to add interactivity to web sites as well as being able to build complete Single Page Applications (SPAs). Instead of taking on the full complexity of a full build system, you can start small with Vue and scale as your needs change. Vue has been specifically built to handle a variety of scenarios, instead of being singularly focused on large, enterprise-scale applications. While using transpilers, loaders, and command-line tools are possible, Vue also allows you to just drop a single JavaScript file on your page and start building smart, client-side interactivity.
</p><p>In this course, I'll start with an existing ASP.NET Core 2 website and add a small Vue application and scale it up to show all of what is capable with Vue. While I'll begin with a simple web page, I will scale it up to a full SPA using Webpack and ES2015.
