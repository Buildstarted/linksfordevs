                                Dmitry is a professional software developer. Dmitry has excellent coding skills, but is also very good in communicating about design documents, project status and other work context issues.

                                Dmitry Pavlov is an excellent resource with the ability to make any project a success. Dmitry is a leader and loves what he does every day. 
                            </p><p>
                                I had the pleasure of working with Dmitry on a large multi-million dollar project to deliver a social impact platform for a Top 100 Non Profit organization.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Apart from demonstrating excellent technical knowledge, Dmitry's drive to work, curiosity and ability to place interesting questions was even driving force for developing one of the Dunnhumby's internal products.
                            </p><p>
                                He is very easy to communicate with and even when Dmitry's finished his contract he was able to help fellow developers tasked with a similar problem.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Dmitry was a real asset on our project. The speed that he assimilated information from developers that were leaving was impressive. Very quickly he became a "go to" expert on the project.
                            </p><p>
                                Dmitry is a great collaborator, building networks quickly and easily and always eager to share his expertise with others to benefit the project. I would welcome the opportunity to work with Dmitry again.
                            </p>

                                Dmitry hit the ground running and has consistently delivered top quality work and supported the rest of the team with great technical advice.
                            </p><p>
                                I would have no hesitation in engaging him again on my next project.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                Dmitry's skills are well characterized by the fact that we hired another senior developer / architect, and he recognized Dmitry as an expert he has been following in the .NET world.
                            </p><p>
                                If you work with Dmitry, you can expect full professionalism, transparent daily reporting, and excellent stakeholder management from him.
                                This includes Dmitry asking questions that help developers, product managers, and others organize their thoughts, as well as cooperating with the rest of the development team.
                                Dmitry went the extra mile to learn some IT Operations skills to interface with other departments of the company and fill in our temporary shortage of infrastructure experts on our projects.
                            </p><p>
                                Besides all these advantages, the "coding machine" nickname describes Dmitry's effective way of working with code and writing maintainable solutions quite accurately.
                                Hiring Dmitry is a great decision, I can highly recommend working with him on any .NET project.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                                Dmitry was a GREAT asset and contributor to our project. A full-stack .NET developer with impressive technical skills, he learned our unusual business and technical landscape extremely quickly, was an excellent communicator, was always willing to help others and take on new tasks/challenges, and was always positive and professional despite some challenging project circumstances. A consummate professional. I HIGHLY and unreservedly recommend Dmitry for any project.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                                Dmitry helped us design and develop our Document management system. The project included managing documents, interacting with third party APIs and developing custom queues. Dmitry was always on top of latest technology trends and helped implementing the optimal solution. Dmitry always delivered on time and with minimal issues. Apart from clearly understanding our requirements, Dmitry went over and beyond in implementing improved set of features - which impressed our business team. Dmitry is a great person to work with and will be a great asset for anyone using his skill set.
                            </p>
                        <div>

                        <div>
                            <p>
                                When we were looking to supplement our team, we were somewhat skeptical of bringing someone in from a third-party vendor for a short period because of the time normally required to bring a resource up-to-speed on a project. We were encouraged by Dmitry's resume and pleasantly surprised at how quickly he was productive in a complex environment involving multiple modules by multiple companies in a single repository with shared framework components.
                            </p><p>
                                Dmitry was not only involved in the technical details very quickly, even considering what for many is a difficult environment to navigate, but he was also contributing to the business domain conversation with very experienced experts from the very early stages of his engagement.
                            </p><p>
                                I have no doubt that Dmitry can be a strong contributor in most software projects today.

                            </p><p>
                                Well motivated and insightful programmer with a great skill to analyze and summarize ideas. His technical skills and dedication makes Dmitry to view solutions instead of problems.

We are extremely pleased with his work.

                                Dmitry is very detail oriented. He has demonstrated excellent technical leadership skill. He has taken responsibility of the entire development of the HRIS-Inbound component. He is the go to person for any outsourced development activity for the Exigen Team (related to this project). He led the development on DataFlux implementation (without any formal training) and .NET service and component development. He also led and developed the Configuration User Interface where on several occasions he has come up with alternate design/flow options which have been accepted by the business team. It has been a pleasure working with Dmitry.

                                Dimitry works as a technical lead consultant to Mercer on a new development H&amp;B mid-market project. He has demonstrated excellent technical skill using .net and dataflux technologies (which the team learned without formal training). He has proved to be a good leader to his development team and demonstrates good english skills when communicating with US Mercer. He is thoughtful, analytical and remains calm in the face of stressful situation. I very much enjoy working with Dimitry.
