Clicking the “Star” button simply says, “I find this interesting.” Not a bad signal to collect, but not the last word on whether or not a project is successful.</p><p id="cc1c" data-selectable-paragraph="">Despite this, stars are enticing. They’re simple, countable, and signal positive feedback. As a user, a high star count gives you a reason to check out one project over another. As a maintainer, every bump in stars gives you a little boost of dopamine—and I’m speaking from experience here.</p><p id="3bca" data-selectable-paragraph="">I work on <a href="https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cortex, open source machine learning infrastructure</a>, and despite knowing better, I still get irrationally excited by surges in stars.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*XR8kTNavNSPDwMh3CFhP-w.png?q=20" width="1746" height="1092" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="1746" height="1092" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*XR8kTNavNSPDwMh3CFhP-w.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*XR8kTNavNSPDwMh3CFhP-w.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*XR8kTNavNSPDwMh3CFhP-w.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*XR8kTNavNSPDwMh3CFhP-w.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1746/1*XR8kTNavNSPDwMh3CFhP-w.png"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">Source: <a href="https://star-history.t9t.io/#cortexlabs/cortex" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star History</a></figcaption></figure><p id="52f7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Apparently, I’m not alone. There is an entire ecosystem built around stars. Open source marketing has become its own niche.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*enwi3WHpNZDcSZYq60VuIg.png?q=20" width="1358" height="1122" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="1358" height="1122" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*enwi3WHpNZDcSZYq60VuIg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*enwi3WHpNZDcSZYq60VuIg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*enwi3WHpNZDcSZYq60VuIg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*enwi3WHpNZDcSZYq60VuIg.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1358/1*enwi3WHpNZDcSZYq60VuIg.png"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="839f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Open source teams dedicate announcements to star milestones. A whole suite of tools has emerged for tracking and analyzing star growth (see the chart above).</p><p id="6fab" data-selectable-paragraph="">Somewhere along the line, stars went from “a public way to support a project” to “the currency of open source software,” and it’s worth reevaluating how much a star really counts for.</p><p id="a160" data-selectable-paragraph="">Stars do certainly have value—more on that later—but the emphasis on them today is out of proportion. In general, stars are not as valuable as we tend to treat them, for a few reasons.</p><h2 id="0caf" data-selectable-paragraph="">1. Stars aren’t equivalent to users</h2><p id="f8c2" data-selectable-paragraph="">You can star a project without using it. You can use a project without starring it. This might feel obvious, but it’s important to underscore that stars and users don’t share a necessarily causal relationship (though, of course, one can lead to the other).</p><p id="a072" data-selectable-paragraph="">At Cortex, for instance, a surprising number of users haven’t starred the repo.</p><p id="4a4e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Our north star for evaluating whether or not Cortex is healthy is the number of people using it to deploy models in production. We measure that by interacting with actual users. If that number is going up, we know we’re doing something right. If it’s going down, we have some issues to address, even if the star count is increasing.</p><h2 id="94ef" data-selectable-paragraph="">2. Stars are highly dependent on context</h2><p id="53b7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Stars are not a consistent unit of value, and comparing star counts between projects isn’t completely straightforward.</p><p id="ba28" data-selectable-paragraph="">The size and activity of a project’s community, its number of potential users, and the marketing efforts of the maintainers have a massive effect on a project’s star count.</p><p id="f085" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you are a frontend Javascript framework and you have Facebook’s marketing budget, for example, you’re going to have more stars than a tool for DevOps engineers. In other words, the fact that React has <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">148,000 stars</a> compared to Elasticsearch’s <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">49,000</a> doesn’t say much about whether or not Elasticsearch is a success—they’re apples and oranges.</p><h2 id="e7fe" data-selectable-paragraph="">3. Stars are still fundamentally a social media engagement</h2><p id="9f00" data-selectable-paragraph="">GitHub obviously isn’t Twitter, but stars are still a social media engagement, and all the usual caveats apply.</p><p id="2a22" data-selectable-paragraph="">For starters, some GitHub users are more active on the social side than others. Some users star 2,000 projects, others barely star any.</p><p id="963f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Similarly, many GitHub users use stars to signal general support for a project, even if they never intend to use it. When we first launched Cortex, for example, we received a lot of stars from the Go community, even from people who weren’t interested in machine learning. There’s nothing wrong with that—and we’re very grateful for the support—it just reinforces that stars are disconnected from usage.</p><p id="19ba" data-selectable-paragraph="">Despite the above caveats, getting a star is still a good thing (in fact, if you want to <a href="https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">give Cortex a star</a>, please don’t let me stop you).</p><p id="4b2d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Stars are a signal that people are generally interested in a project, and in the same vein, can provide a useful benchmark between similar projects. It might not make any sense to compare React and Elasticsearch, but the fact that React has over twice the stars of Angular is probably meaningful.</p><p id="cec0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Stars also provide some feedback as to <em>who</em> finds a project interesting. With Cortex, we were somewhat surprised to see how popular the project was among <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-we-built-an-ml-platform-for-developers-not-just-data-scientists-be7f6b8308f">developers, not just data scientists</a>. This influenced quite a few decisions in how we’ve developed the project.</p><p id="9dcb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Finally, stars make a project more discoverable. Beyond the obvious fact that a high star count helps a project stand out, they also impact GitHub’s recommendations. I routinely find new ML projects because of similar projects I’ve starred:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ZsDHkZK5h73Sj1acwgkBlg.png?q=20" width="1526" height="630" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="1526" height="630" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ZsDHkZK5h73Sj1acwgkBlg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ZsDHkZK5h73Sj1acwgkBlg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*ZsDHkZK5h73Sj1acwgkBlg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ZsDHkZK5h73Sj1acwgkBlg.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="7009" data-selectable-paragraph="">For all of these reasons, stars are valuable—they just aren’t a <em>complete</em> metric for evaluating an open source project.</p></div></div></section></div></div></div>
