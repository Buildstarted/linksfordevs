</p><p>But with that said, Krissler and Albrecht first took photos of their vein patterns. They used a converted SLR camera with the infrared filter removed; this allowed them to see the pattern of the veins under the skin.</p><p>"It's enough to take photos from a distance of five meters, and it might work to go to a press conference and take photos of them," Krissler explained. In all, the pair took over 2,500 pictures to over 30 days to perfect the process and find an image that worked.</p><p>They then used that image to make a wax model of their hands which included the vein detail.</p></div></div></div></div>
