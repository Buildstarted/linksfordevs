            <p>How much can you trust the assertions made by an organisation regarding their security posture? I don't mean to question whether the statements are truthful or not, but rather whether they provide any <em>actual</em> assurance whatsoever. For example, nearly 5 years ago now I wrote about how <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/we-take-security-seriously-otherwise/">"we take security seriously" was a ridiculous statement to make immediately after a data breach</a>. It seems that not much has changed since then:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-0" data-tweet-id="1179321322175905792"></twitter-widget> <!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-1" data-tweet-id="1177421192984223745"></twitter-widget> <!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-2" data-tweet-id="1205270042675298305"></twitter-widget> <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That last one is particularly apt here as it gets us on-topic with kids watches. Almost a year ago to the day, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/how-to-track-your-kids-and-other-peoples-kids-with-the-tictoctrack-watch/">I wrote about a serious flaw in TicTocTrack watches</a> that made it trivial to track kids, re-position them and even enable strangers to call their watch which would answer with zero interaction from the child. This wasn't the first instance of a tracking device on a kid going wrong, it was just the latest in a long line of them. To their credit, TicTocTrack rectified the flaw (<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-4/">insecure direct object references</a>), communicated with parents and got back to business. Meanwhile, the whole kids-watch-security-train-wreck continued:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-3" data-tweet-id="1199071850669772803"></twitter-widget> <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In that tweet, I concluded that "the pattern is alarmingly predictable" which foreshadowed what would inevitably be yet more incidents with yet more kids watches to come. TicTocTrack saw things differently:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-4" data-tweet-id="1199474601887064065"></twitter-widget> <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The linked piece is titled "Cyber Resilience Key For iStaySafe" and is a short read wound up with a link to a PR company's email address. Amongst the reassurances of their investment in security is this paragraph:</p><blockquote>In the following months, iStaySafe made significant investments both financially and by allocating staff resources to conduct a comprehensive penetration test of their software platform, mobile applications, sales website, all API’s and entire systems architecture. This investigation was conducted by a 3rd party C.R.E.S.T certified cybersecurity firm based in Brisbane to ensure that iStaySafe and subsidiary TicTocTrack has the best-practice cybersecurity and risk management protocols in place.</blockquote><p>This is not at all unusual and it's from the same old "reassure customers of how seriously we take security" playbook. Many organisations assert precisely the same things: penetration tests, code reviews, ticks from certified bodies etc. A <em>really </em>key thing to understand here is that most of this is "point in time"; when the penetration test was conducted, everything was ok (or appropriately remediated). But the next day? Who knows. I don't mean to solely criticise TicTocTrack here, this is pretty standard PR which in my mind, didn't change a thing:</p><p>Sure enough, less than 2 months later, someone sent me my entire TicTocRecord pulled out via a flaw in their system:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><pre>[

}</pre><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Fortunately, that person was <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5000879">Gordon Beeming</a>, a fellow Microsoft Most Valuable Professional who identified the vulnerability, contacted me privately, had the details passed on to TicTocTrack and then the flaw remediated before writing about it publicly a couple of weeks ago:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-5" data-tweet-id="1240215284444737536"></twitter-widget> <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>And the nature of the flaw? Take this URL:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><pre><code>/api/Users?$filter=(FamilyIdentifier%20eq%204236)</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now consider the filter in the query string and ponder: "what would happen if there was no filter"? Here's what Gordon wrote:</p><blockquote>I thought what happens if I browse directly to that container without any filter, this pulled to my browser every user in their system</blockquote><p>And that's how he ended up with every user in the system, including myself.</p><p>The point of all this is that despite the best of intentions (and I do believe their intentions are good), per the title of this post those good intentions and reassuring words do not mean that a security incident won't occur. Obviously, they also don't mean that one won't <em>reoccur </em>and any assertion to the contrary puts us back at the same November discussion in the tweets above (and we now know how that worked out).</p><p>So, should you not buy a kids tracking watch due to the inherent risks? I'm not saying that any more than I'm saying you shouldn't buy a connected sex toy; by all means, if one of these devices provides value to you and <em>you're conscious of the privacy risks and willing to accept them</em>, then do it. But for me, my own personal risk assessment puts a lot of weight in the old mantra of "you cannot lose what you do not have" so no, I wouldn't buy either.</p><p>Further to this, <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/australian-kids-smartwatch-maker-hit-by-same-bug-again-a-14046">Jeremy Kirk has written about the incident today</a> including comments from TicTocTrack on their decision <em>not </em>to disclose the exposure of their customer database in January this year. That's a bit tangential to the purpose of this blog post so I won't delve into it here, but leave your thoughts on that in the comments below. Here's their statement from the cyber resilience page mentioned earlier, just for context:</p><blockquote>iStaySafe will continue to operate in an open, transparent and honest manner</blockquote>
