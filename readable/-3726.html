    <blockquote><span>Abstract:</span>  Website fingerprinting attacks, which use statistical analysis on network
traffic to compromise user privacy, have been shown to be effective even if the
traffic is sent over anonymity-preserving networks such as Tor. The classical
attack model used to evaluate website fingerprinting attacks assumes an on-path
adversary, who can observe all traffic traveling between the user's computer
and the Tor network. In this work we investigate these attacks under a
different attack model, in which the adversary is capable of running a small
amount of unprivileged code on the target user's computer. Under this model,
the attacker can mount cache side-channel attacks, which exploit the effects of
contention on the CPU's cache, to identify the website being browsed. In an
important special case of this attack model, a JavaScript attack is launched
when the target user visits a website controlled by the attacker. The
effectiveness of this attack scenario has never been systematically analyzed,
especially in the open-world model which assumes that the user is visiting a
mix of both sensitive and non-sensitive sites. In this work we show that cache
website fingerprinting attacks in JavaScript are highly feasible, even when
they are run from highly restrictive environments, such as the Tor Browser.
Specifically, we use machine learning techniques to classify traces of cache
activity. Unlike prior works, which try to identify cache conflicts, our work
measures the overall occupancy of the last-level cache. We show that our
approach achieves high classification accuracy in both the open-world and the
closed-world models. We further show that our techniques are resilient both to
network-based defenses and to side-channel countermeasures introduced to modern
browsers as a response to the Spectre attack.
