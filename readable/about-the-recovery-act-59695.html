            <p>Welcome to WhiteHouse.gov/Recovery – the place to follow America’s recovery story.</p>
<p>On February 17th, 2009, the President signed <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/09/02/14/A-major-milestone/">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a>, or Recovery Act, into law. This Act is an unprecedented effort to jumpstart our economy, save and create millions of jobs, and put a down payment on addressing long-neglected challenges so that our country can thrive in the 21st century.</p>
<p>The President selected Vice President Joe Biden to oversee the Administration’s implementation of the Recovery Act’s provisions – a choice that signifies the importance of this critical task for our country’s future. Vice President Biden works closely with cabinet members, our nation’s governors, and our mayors to ensure these efforts are not just swift, but efficient and effective.</p>
<p>At the signing of the bill, President Obama candidly explained that the road ahead would not be easy – economic recovery requires work and dedication from us all:</p>
<p>None of this will be easy. The road to recovery will not be straight. We will make progress and there may be some slippage along the way. It will demand courage and discipline. It will demand a new sense of responsibility that's been missing from Wall Street all the way to Washington. There will be hazards and reverses. But I have every confidence that if we are willing to continue doing the critical work that must be done -- by each of us, by all of us -- then we will leave this struggling economy behind us, and come out on the other side, more prosperous as a people.</p>
<p>This website, WhiteHouse.gov/Recovery, will tell the story of our nation’s road to recovery.&nbsp; Featured recovery stories about individuals and communities will coincide with the voice of the Vice President and the Administration – who will use this site to communicate up-to-date information on the state of recovery in an effort to live up to the promise of transparency and accountability. Keep visiting this site to stay informed on the progress of the Recovery Act and read America’s recovery story as it is written.</p>
