The fact that it's not best-fit is also not strictly-speaking incorrect: the function still maintains all the invariants the calling code expects, the fact that it's not best-fit is not one of them.</p><p>While the current implementation is probably faster than a true best-fit allocation strategy, there are problematic fragmentation concerns associated with deviating from either best-fit or address-ordered first-fit (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/paul-wilson/fragmentation.pdf">https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/paul-wilson/fragmentation.pdf</a>).</p><p>This unusual allocation policy wasn't even noticeable prior to Go 1.12 because we had a set of linked-lists which would be checked in size order: spans of size &lt;=128 would be allocated in best-fit order! Anything bigger would not.</p><p>As of Go 1.12 though, everything relies on this crazy ordering.</p><p>Many, many eyeballs have looked over that code, but it wasn't until I added treap tests in Go 1.13 that I actually noticed a problem. Also, some users have been reporting an increase in virtual memory usage in Go 1.12, which is likely related.</p><p>This should be fixed sooner rather than later. I'm still hoping to get a version of my proposal in for Go 1.13 (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="412657034" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30333" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/golang/go/issues/30333/hovercard" href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30333">#30333</a>) which would move us over to an address-ordered first-fit policy (that is tested) which would solve this (and is confirmed to reduce VSS growth issues).</p><p>CC <a class="user-mention" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/aclements/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/aclements">@aclements</a></p></div></div></div></div>
