            <p>If you are one of our customers, I’m pretty sure that you’re aware that DevExpress recognizes that .NET is of great importance. We were the first Microsoft partner to produce a UI control for WinForms way back in 2002 (the grid!), and have moved forward with other components and libraries for .NET in leaps and bounds. We now cover ASP.NET, MVC, WPF, with UI controls, reporting, and dashboards, and now are fully embracing .NET Core, Blazor, and the other platforms and features that Microsoft are targeting.</p><p>Back in 2014, Microsoft formed the <a title="Homepage for the .NET Foundation" href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/">.NET Foundation</a> as an independent, non-profit organization, designed to encourage and promote open-source development for and collaboration around the .NET ecosystem. As part of this organization, we took over the <a title="Github repository for the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit" href="https://github.com/DevExpress/AjaxControlToolkit">ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit</a> from Microsoft and have actively maintained it as open source and enhanced it along with the improvements in ASP.NET over the years.</p><p>Today, we are taking that collaboration a step further: I am proud to announce that Developer Express has become a corporate sponsor of the .NET Foundation. As such, we are looking forward to being even more involved in the planning for .NET, collaborating even more (is that possible?) with the various product teams, and helping that valuable .NET open source community grow.</p>
