    <meta property="og:description" content="The 50 Cent Party, or 50 Cent Army (Chinese: &#x4E94;&#x6BDB;&#x515A;), is the colloquial term for Internet commentators (Chinese: &#x7F51;&#x7EDC;&#x8BC4;&#x8BBA;&#x5458;), who are hired by Chinese authorities in an attempt to manipulate public opinion to the benefit of the Chinese Communist Party.[1][2] It was created during the early phases of the Internet&#x27;s rollout to the wider public in China. The name derives from the allegation that commentators are said to be paid &#xA5;0.50 for every post,[3][4][5] though some speculate that they are probably not paid anything for the posts, instead being required to do so as a part of their official Party duties.[6] They create favourable comments or articles on popular Chinese social media networks that are intended to derail discussions that are unhelpful to the Communist Party and that promote narratives that serve the government&#x27;s interests, together with disparaging comments and misinformation about political opponents and critics of the Chinese government, both domestic and abroad.[7][8][9] It is also used as a derogatory term against people with perceived pro-CPC or Chinese nationalist views.[10]"/>

</p><p>A 2016 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> paper found that in contrast to common assumptions, the 50 Cent Army consists mostly of paid bureaucrats who respond to government directives and flood Chinese social media with pro-government comments. They also rarely engage in direct arguments, and around 80% of the analysed posts involve pro-China cheerleading with inspirational slogans, and 13% involve general praise and suggestions on governmental policies.<sup id="cite_ref-Wertime_10-1"><a href="#cite_note-Wertime-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-King_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-King-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>Research indicated a "massive secretive operation" to fill China's Internet with propaganda has resulted in some 488 million posts carried out by fake social media accounts, representing about 0.6% of the 80 billion posts generated on Chinese social media.

The popular "Little Lily" BBS, run by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University" title="Nanjing University">Nanjing University</a>, was forced to close. As a new system was prepared to be launched, school officials hired students as part-time web commentators, paid from the university's work-study funds, to search the forum for undesirable information and actively counter it with Party-friendly viewpoints.

<p>Among those names, "50 Cent Party" (五毛党) was the most common and pejorative unofficial term.<sup id="cite_ref-China's_plan_to_use_internet_for_propaganda_40-0"><a href="#cite_note-China's_plan_to_use_internet_for_propaganda-40">[40]</a></sup> It was created by Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen" title="Netizen">netizens</a> as a satire. Many trace the origin of the "50-cent" name to the salaries at the Publicity Department of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changsha" title="Changsha">Changsha</a>, which according to the English version of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Times" title="Global Times">Global Times</a></i>, supplemented Internet Commentators' basic income with 50 cents ("5 mao")<sup id="cite_ref-mao_41-0"><a href="#cite_note-mao-41">[note 1]</a></sup> per post since October 2004.
</p><p>The term is applied by Chinese netizens to any person who blatantly expresses pro-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China" title="Communist Party of China">Communist Party</a> thoughts online.<sup id="cite_ref-dnai_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-dnai-4">[4]</a></sup> However, there's another word "5 US cent (五美分)" used by some netizens to denigrate anti-party comments, with the implication that those commentators are hired by the governments of the United States, Taiwan or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world#Modern_political" title="Western world">western countries</a>. Zhang Shengjun, a professor of international politics at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Normal_University" title="Beijing Normal University">Beijing Normal University</a> published an article <i>Who would be afraid of the cap of "50 Cent Party"?</i> on the Chinese version of <i>Global Times</i>, saying that the term is spread by western media outfits, "it has become a baton waved towards all Chinese patriots" to make the Chinese government a constant target of criticism.<sup id="cite_ref-huanqiu_42-0"><a href="#cite_note-huanqiu-42">[41]</a></sup>
</p><p>Chinese cyberspace is also noted for its ideological contests between "rightists" - reformists who advocate Western style democratic reforms, versus "leftists" - conservatives and neo-Confucianists who advocates Chinese nationalism and restructured socialism. In this backdrop, rightists sometimes refer to leftists derogatorily as "50 Centers", regardless of their actual employment background.<sup id="cite_ref-Wertime_10-3"><a href="#cite_note-Wertime-10">[10]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Hong Kong-based <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Daily" title="Apple Daily">Apple Daily</a></i> reported that although a search for "五毛党" ("50 Cent Party" in Chinese) on a search engine produces results, most were inaccessible and had been deleted.
