                        <p><b>ï»¿Published 1st November</b></p><p>Quality and quantity are completely different things, and sometimes the best light is to be found when there actually isnâ€™t very much light available&nbsp;at all. Thatâ€™s why the ability to take great photos in low light is very important. Weâ€™ve addressed this with the main feature in this issue, which looks at landscapes, astro and cityscapes. Elsewhere, we've looked at photographing birds from hides, covering all the skills and techniques required to master this challenging subject matter. We also have an in-depth guide to the easily overlooked craft of food photography. As always, there are shooting tutorials, interviews with leading professionals, an in-depth career guide, product reviews and industry news to keep you abreast of the latest developments, and to help inform your future kit purchases.</p>
