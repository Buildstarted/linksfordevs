The average amount a cancer patient lost was $92,098.</span></p><p><span>After tracking 9.5 million cancer patients from 2000 to 2012, researchers also learned that 62% of all cancer patients are in debt because of their treatment, and 55% of them owe at least $10,000. </span></p><p><span>Overall, the total medical costs for cancer are </span><a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/economic-impact-of-cancer.html"><span>$80 billion</span></a><span> in the US. </span></p><p><span>Even if you have insurance, it may not cover all the medical costs associated with cancer. From high deductibles to large copayments, cancer patients can end up with a huge stack of bills.</span></p><p><span>In addition, 40% to 85% of all cancer patients have to quit working while undergoing treatment, which creates a financial burden that can last for six months or longer. </span></p><p><em><span>For more head to </span></em><a href="https://www.insider.com/"><em><span>INSIDER&apos;s homepage</span></em></a><em><span>.</span></em><span> &#xA0;</span></p></div>
