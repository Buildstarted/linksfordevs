If you're reading this now, it's not a Coincidence. You’re interested in Learning and Mastering Kubernetes.!!<br>Kubernetes container orchestration solution is one of the fastest growing open source projects of recent years. All major cloud providers, such as  Google,  Amazon,  Microsoft, and others now offer  Kubernetes instances, and countless companies are outsourcing their Applications to  Clusters in the cloud running  Kubernetes. We take a closer look at  Kubernetes and the concepts behind it.  </p><p><span><!-- react-text: 475 -->&nbsp;<!-- /react-text -->...more</span></p></div><div><p>Kubernetes automates many things that used to be done by system administrators, such as network  Configuration, load balancing, upgrades, patches, etc.Some of these tasks are integrated directly into Kubernetes, such as load sharing or  Auto-Scaling, others are provided as add-ons or extensions.  Kubernetes is therefore a great help for system administrators. But Kubernetes also offers decisive advantages for  Software Development, since time and effort for Deployment are considerably reduced. Zero-downtime deployments are no problem as Kubernetes also runs rolling updates as standard. Especially useful is the automatic scaling in  Kubernetes. Peak loads no longer automatically lead to a downtime of the application. In this book,  Readers will get an initial insight into Kubernetes and how they can use this  Open Source System in their environment. They will learn how to manage containers with the help of suitable tools and strategies how to implement Microservices.  Following are some Concepts that you will learn from this book :<br>Overview of Kubernetes<br>Main components of Kubernetes<br>Key Notions of Kubernetes<br>How to install Kubernetes manually<br>Things required before Kubernetes deployment<br> Deploy Kubernetes with Ansible<br>Deployment setup<br>How to launch container pods with Kubernetes?<br>How to setup Kubernetes Cluster?<br>How to Troubleshoot Kubernetes?<br>And many more...<br>This book will Guide you as a beginner to Learn and Master Kubernetes<br>So what are you waiting for?

We begin by setting up our development environment using Git, yarn, Babel, and ESLint. Then, we will use Express, Elasticsearch and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to build a stateless API service. For the front-end, we will use React, Redux, and Webpack.  A central theme in the book is maintaining code quality. As such, we will enforce a Test-Driven Development (TDD) process using Selenium, Cucumber, Mocha, Sinon, and Istanbul. As we progress through the book, the focus will shift towards automation and infrastructure.

Kubernetes is an orchestrator that creates and manages your containers on clusters of servers. This book will guide you from simply deploying a container to administrate a Kubernetes cluster, and then you will learn how to do monitoring, logging, and continuous deployment in DevOps. The initial stages of the book will introduce the fundamental DevOps and the concept of containers. It will move on to how to containerize applications and deploy them into. The book will then introduce networks in Kubernetes. We then move on to advanced DevOps skills such as monitoring, logging, and continuous deployment in Kubernetes. It will proceed to introduce permission control for Kubernetes resources via attribute-based access control and role-based access control. The final stage of the book will cover deploying and managing your container clusters on the popular public cloud Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. At the end of the book, other orchestration frameworks, such as Docker Swarm mode, Amazon ECS, and Apache Mesos will be discussed<br>Style and approach<br>Readers will be taken through fundamental DevOps skills and Kubernetes concept and administration with detailed examples.

But they come with their own set of challenges. This is where Kubernetes comes in.Kubernetes (commonly stylized as k8s) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts".With Kubernetes we can quickly deploy our applications, scaling it according to our needs, without having to stop anything in the process. </p><p><span><!-- react-text: 10615 -->&nbsp;<!-- /react-text -->...more</span></p></div><div><p>It is made to be portable, extensive and self-healing, granting an easier management from people who have to administer the system.With Kubernetes, you can develop your applications on your laptop, deploy to your chosen cloud platform, migrate to a different cloud platform, and even migrate to your private cloud at your on-premises datacenter.The detailed nature of this book gives readers the perfect balance of background information and practical tools and insight.Hence, go ahead and dive right into the contents of the book! Below are some of the chapters in this guide:• What Kubernetes is• Kubernetes architecture• Concepts and design principles• Kubernetes monitoring• The basics of Kubernetes networking• Introduction to Kubernetes monitoring• The best open-source tools for Kubernetes monitoring• Kubernetes deployment• Configuration management• Kubernetes pods• Understanding kubernetes services• Kubernetes patterns• Kubernetes client libraries and extension• And much more…Get a copy of Kubernetes Complete Guide and get all the up-to date information you need!</p><p><span><!-- react-text: 10620 -->&nbsp;(<!-- /react-text -->show less<!-- react-text: 10622 -->)<!-- /react-text --></span></p></div></div><!-- react-empty: 10623 --><!-- react-empty: 10631 --></div></div></div><div data-title="Production-Ready Microservices on Google Cloud" data-id="1082736325" id="book-1082736325"><p><span>93</span></p><div><div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Production-Ready-Microservices-Google-Navveen-Balani/dp/1082736325?tag=uuid10-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-amzn-asin="1082736325"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4149P9lCg1L.jpg" alt="Book Cover of Navveen Balani - Production-Ready Microservices on Google Cloud"></a></div><div><div><div><p>Containers are becoming a standard way to run and scale microservices across multiple cloud providers. With Kubernetes, the job of deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications on cloud or on promises is now mainstream and extremely streamlined.</p><p><span><!-- react-text: 10717 -->&nbsp;<!-- /react-text -->...more</span></p></div><div><p>To build a production grade environment, however, you need a host of other components like Virtual Private Network (VPN), endpoint management for microservices, load balancer to balance request over various protocols (HTTP, HTTP(s), Web socket), Configuring SSL, Health monitoring of services, Network configuration like Whitelisting of IPs, Network address translation (NAT) for Outbound connections, and ensuring logging at various entry points in your application.In this book, we will go through the steps to create a production ready environment on Google cloud for deploying microservices.The book assumes you are familiar with Kubernetes and Google cloud. The book introduces some of the concepts briefly while setting up the production environment and deploying the solution.We would be deploying a set of micro services (as containers) on Google Kubernetes Cluster. We would use Google Endpoints for API management and deploy the google endpoint container along with our microservices container. We would further create an Ingress Controller (of type Load Balancer) and expose our application microservices over HTTPS. All incoming HTTPS requests would go to a Load balancer, which would direct them to one of the nodes in the Kubernetes Cluster. In the nodes, the requests would first go to Google endpoint (which would validate the endpoint key and logs all endpoint request) and then to the respective microservice endpoints.There are additional requirements on ensuring only authorized IPs access our microservices. We will learn how to whitelist the IPs using two approaches - Google Cloud Armor and Nginx Ingress Controller (instead of the default Google Ingress Controller).Similarly, for outbound connections, we would be connecting to third-party services. The third-party services employ similar IP whitelisting requirements, and we’ll need to provide our set of outbound IPs that would connect to these third-party services. For this requirement, we would be use Google Cloud NAT to provide our private Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters the ability to connect to the Internet, as well as Static outbound IPs that we can configure and provide to third-party services to whitelist on their servers.</p><p><span><!-- react-text: 10722 -->&nbsp;(<!-- /react-text -->show less<!-- react-text: 10724 -->)<!-- /react-text --></span></p></div></div><!-- react-empty: 10725 --></div></div></div><div data-title="Advanced Platform Development with Kubernetes: Enabling Data Management, the Internet of Things, Blockchain, and Machine Learning" data-id="1484256107" id="book-1484256107"><p><span>94</span></p><div><div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1484256107?tag=uuid10-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-amzn-asin="1484256107"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51cAmwRRw1L.jpg" alt="Book Cover of Craig Johnston - Advanced Platform Development with Kubernetes: Enabling Data Management, the Internet of Things, Blockchain, and Machine Learning"></a></div><div><div><div><p>Leverage Kubernetes for the rapid adoption of emerging technologies.
