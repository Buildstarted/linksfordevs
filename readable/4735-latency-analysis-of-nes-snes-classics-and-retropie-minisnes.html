Older twitch-based games are highly sensitive to input latency, and input latency has gotten worse over time.  Controllers are more complicated, screens are more complicated, and <a href="https://byuu.org/articles/latency/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">emulators themselves have inherent latency</a>.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I wrote an iOS app, <a href="http://isitsnappy.com/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Is It Snappy?</a>, that makes it convenient to use your iPhone's high-speed camera to measure and quantify the latency between a button press and the screen's pixels changing.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When the SNES Classic came out, I was curious - how does it compare to the physical hardware?  How does it compare to a RetroPie?  How does a computer monitor (traditionally low latency) compare to my TV (which felt bad to me but I couldn't quantify).  How much does turning game mode on or off matter?</p><p class="_1WODZhR-x-fbMu3MOL9cH1">Does latency even matter?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I occasionally hear the argument "human reaction times are hundreds of milliseconds, therefore a little latency doesn't matter."  The problem is that latency is additive.  If you're a major league batter, a fastball takes a bit over 400 milliseconds to reach home plate.  Imagine having a 200 ms delay between choosing to swing and that swing taking place.  It would be impossible.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Twitchy action games are similar.  Obviously input latency doesn't matter much for a strategy game but even Super Mario World is noticeably harder with 100 milliseconds of latency.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I personally find a 50 ms delay nearly unnoticeable, 100 ms somewhat mushy, and 150+ is terrible and frustrating.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If you're curious, here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOvQCPLkPt4" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">awesome video from Microsoft Research</a> showing how a touch screen from 100 ms to 1 ms is a big interactivity improvement.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHLpKzUxjGk" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">his presentation at UMKC</a>, John Carmack also goes into depth about why latencies are important and how they're being addressed in the context of virtual reality.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Finally, note that some people are more or less sensitive to latency.  If none of this stuff bothers you or you're totally happy with your setup, then feel free to stop reading!</p><p class="_1WODZhR-x-fbMu3MOL9cH1">Methodology</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">On the NES, I recorded a simple jump in the first level of Super Mario Bros.  On the SNES, the same, but in Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island 2.  I marked the start frame as the one closest to when the button switch triggered.  (Accurate timings can be achieved by wiring an LED to the button switch so it lights up when the press is registered.  But I wasn't about to disassemble my controllers.)  I marked the last frame as the one where the pixels on the screen were just starting to change.  Note that pixels on some displays can take an entire frame to fully change color!</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I took five recordings of each and averaged them.  I also have some numbers I'd recorded on other peoples' devices, but where I did not make five recordings.  Latency numbers can be a bit noisy for several reasons: it's hard to tell precisely the frame the button was pressed (~4 ms error), and the screen is only scanned at 60 Hz (~16 ms).</p><p class="_1WODZhR-x-fbMu3MOL9cH1">Hardware</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I tested six platforms: NES, SNES, NES Classic, SNES Classic, and RetroPie's NES and SNES emulators.  In hindsight I should have tested one of my laptops running Higan or something but I'd never have gotten around to making this post...  maybe next time, or you can!  :)</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">RetroPie was running on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a Logitech F310 gamepad.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I tested on the following displays:</p><ul class="_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Old tube TV I found on Craigslist (CRT)</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Dell 2007FP Monitor (2007FP)</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Samsung LN46C650L1F TV (Samsung TV)</p></li></ul><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I couldn't plug the NES Classic or SNES Classic or Raspberry Pi into the CRT, but I did test the NES and SNES on the monitor's and TV's composite input ports.</p><p class="_1WODZhR-x-fbMu3MOL9cH1">The Numbers</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">All times are in milliseconds, rounded whole, plus or minus a few milliseconds.</p><table class="MRH-njmSb5ZTkfb1o4dqv"><thead><tr class="s6JZe6869f81l9E_5G7Q9"><th class="_3TNkDptlyGOiWXvdX_acOB"></th><th class="_3TNkDptlyGOiWXvdX_acOB">CRT</th><th class="_3TNkDptlyGOiWXvdX_acOB">2007FP</th><th class="_3TNkDptlyGOiWXvdX_acOB">Samsung TV</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="s6JZe6869f81l9E_5G7Q9"><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">SNES</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">50</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">96</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">107</td></tr><tr class="s6JZe6869f81l9E_5G7Q9"><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">SNES Classic</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6"></td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">93</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">117</td></tr><tr class="s6JZe6869f81l9E_5G7Q9"><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">RetroPie SNES</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6"></td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">143</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">177</td></tr><tr class="s6JZe6869f81l9E_5G7Q9"><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">NES</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">32</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">73</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">95</td></tr><tr class="s6JZe6869f81l9E_5G7Q9"><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">NES Classic</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6"></td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">95</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">122</td></tr><tr class="s6JZe6869f81l9E_5G7Q9"><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">RetroPie NES</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6"></td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">122</td><td class="_3DYfYn_cczg1wj_a3hhyV6">145</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="_1WODZhR-x-fbMu3MOL9cH1">Bonus Numbers</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I'd also done some ad hoc captures on other people's displays.

My TV is a full 60 ms slower with game mode off.  E's Samsung TV had a 40 ms difference.  Just keep Game Mode on.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The gold standard input is the NES on a CRT.  You can actually observe one CRT beam scan of latency while the NES processes, and the next time the beam comes down the screen, Mario is drawn in a new position.  But CRTs are gone and emulation is here to stay.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">On my digital displays, the composite input ports added substantial latency, over 40 ms.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The SNES Classic is surprisingly great, and on my displays it compares favorably to physical hardware plugged into the composite inputs.  The NES Classic, on the other hand, is a bit worse than physical hardware on the same composite ports.  I don't have an explanation for that.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I was a little surprised to see Super Mario World having one additional frame of latency relative to Super Mario Bros.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Consistently across my measurements, computer monitors are lower latency than TVs.  Nonetheless, some TVs are much better than others.  C was complaining about his Panasonic TV and that he wanted to replace it because it was so old, but (probably because it's so old and has no features), it has the lowest latency of any TV I tested: 83 ms on the SNES ClassicS.  We spent the entire weekend playing the SNES Classic on it and latency was never a big deal.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">My TV is a full two frames slower than his, and it's noticeable.  The only TV I tested that was worse was A's Bravia.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In summary:</p><ul class="_33MEMislY0GAlB78wL1_CR"><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Always have Game Mode on.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When shopping for televisions, measure the input latency because it varies widely.  Alternatively, read the input latency reviews at <a href="http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/reviews.htm" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">TFT Central</a> and <a href="http://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/inputs/input-lag" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">RTINGS</a>.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">You can almost guarantee a good experience by plugging into a computer monitor with built-in speakers.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I am not impressed by RetroPie.  Once you factor in controllers, a decent power supply, and a microSD card, it ends up costing more than the SNES Classic.  In addition, it's more work to set up, all for a sub-par emulation experience.</p></li><li class="_3gqTEjt4x9UIIpWiro7YXz"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The SNES Classic is great.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
