<p>I just opened edge for first time, as I needed another browser to test a page</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OP is about the Edge Chromium rollout that's happened over the past week or so. When that happens, Windows reboots to display Edge and offer import options. It's not a case of you actively opening Edge; the OS presents you with the option, you select what you do/don't want, and then carry on as you wish.</p>

<p>What that means is that if Edge has any of your bookmarks, etc. it's because you previously authorized it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>has all my firefox data</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you ever stopped to think that Microsoft doesn't need a browser to get your "Firefox data?" If you make the assumption, as OP is, that Microsoft is just sucking up your data, all they'd have to do is enable a telemetry job that copies your Firefox profile and sends it to Microsoft. They wouldn't need to waste millions developing and deploying a browser for that.</p>

<p>Trusting an OS that <em>already</em> has access to <em>everything</em> on your computer but distrusting an app made by the OS' developer makes zero sense. If you don't trust the app, then you should probably look into a different OS. In addition to my 5 Windows 10 installations, I run 3 Linux distros, FreeBSD, and Illumos (on separate machines) myself; you don't need to be married to Windows nowadays.</p>
