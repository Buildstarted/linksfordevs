</figure><p>The BBC's Andrew Neil has issued a challenge to Boris Johnson to take part in a sit-down interview with him before next week's general election.</p><p>Mr Johnson is the only leader of a main party not to have faced a half-hour, prime-time BBC One grilling by Mr Neil.</p><p>The Conservative leader has denied claims he is avoiding scrutiny.</p><p>But Mr Neil addressed the PM directly at the end of his fourth leader interview at this election, with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage.</p><p>"It is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say," he said, in a monologue. </p><p>"The theme running through our questions is trust - and why at so many times in his career, in politics and journalism, critics and sometimes even those close to him have deemed him to be untrustworthy. </p><p>"It is, of course, relevant to what he is promising us all now."</p><p>Mr Johnson has also declined an invitation to be grilled by ITV's Julie Etchingham, as part of her series of leader interviews.</p><h2>'Hold to account'</h2><p>Mr Neil said that no broadcaster "can compel a politician to be interviewed". </p><p>But he added: "Leaders' interviews have been a key part of the BBC's prime-time election coverage for decades. </p><p>"We do them, on your behalf, to scrutinise and hold to account those who would govern us. That is democracy. </p><p>"We have always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate. And in every election they have. All of them. Until this one." </p><p>Mr Neil then listed the questions he wanted the prime minister to answer.</p><p>These include whether he can be trusted to deliver on his promises for the NHS - and keeping the health service "off the table" in any post-Brexit trade talks with the US.</p><h2>'Stand up'</h2><p>Mr Neil said he would also ask the PM about his claim that he has always been an opponent of austerity, another "question of trust".</p><p>He ended the monologue by saying: "The prime minister of our nation will, at times, have to stand up to President Trump, President Putin, President Xi of China. </p><p>"So it was surely not expecting too much that he spend half an hour standing up to me."</p><figure>

        </figure><p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage have all faced a grilling by Mr Neil.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000bqpt">his interview with Mr Neil</a>, the Labour leader repeatedly declined to apologise to the Jewish community for anti-Semitism in his party, something he has now done <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50643493">in an interview with ITV's This Morning.</a></p><p>Jo Swinson apologised for supporting welfare cuts when she was part of the Lib Dem/Conservative coalition <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000byy1">in her Neil interview</a>.</p><p>Nicola Sturgeon <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000bqpt">was pressed about Scottish independence and the EU</a>, and her party's record on the NHS in Scotland, while Nigel Farage was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000byz7">forced to defend his decision</a> not to contest Tory seats.</p><h2>Labour complaint</h2><p>Mr Johnson was quizzed by the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, on why he had not yet agreed to be interviewed by Andrew Neil.</p><p>He denied avoiding prime-time scrutiny, saying he had done TV debates, interviews and a "two-hour phone-in".</p><figure>

</figure><p>Separately, on Thursday evening, The Labour Party complained about BBC bias, in a letter to Director General Tony Hall.</p><p>Labour's co-campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne highlighted Mr Johnson's failure to be interviewed by Andrew Neil.</p><p>In his letter, Mr Gwynne claimed the Conservatives were being allowed to "play" the corporation, making the BBC effectively "complicit in giving the Conservative Party an unfair electoral advantage".</p><p>He said Labour had agreed Mr Corbyn's interview with Mr Neil based on the "clear understanding" that Mr Johnson had agreed the same terms.</p><p>"Instead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability."</p><p>The BBC is expected to respond in writing to the Labour complaint.</p><h2>ITV debate</h2><p>But a spokesperson said in a statement: "The BBC will continue to make its own independent editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour."</p><p>In another development, the prime minister's team have confirmed that Mr Johnson will not find time for an interview with ITV before the general election.</p><figure>

His cowardly behaviour shows why he simply isn't fit to be prime minister."</p><p>She said it was "bad enough" that her party had been "excluded" from the BBC's head-to-head debate between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn, and "even worse that right now Boris Johnson won't be held properly to account for his lies and extreme Brexit plans".</p><p>Mr Johnson will face Mr Corbyn in a prime ministerial debate at 2030 GMT, on BBC One, on Friday.</p>
