    <p>I realize that I always have ideas flash around, and at most time they are connected to each other. I believed they would form remarkable articles or even books, only if I was able to write them down methodically.</p>

<p>I know it’s good to write down my thoughts, to let people know how I think about things, and of course it will encourage true discussions on ideas and improve me myself from inside. But I still can’t remain committed to writing. I always have arguments on dropping it, either I don’t have good writing tools, or writing costs too much time, or I’m not good at organizing words or sentences.</p>

<p>Needless to say adhere to writing, I didn’t even start it. My first post in this blog was written in September of 2012, it is almost 8 years, and I only have such few articles. Even if I could do one per month, I would still get 100 articles. Shame.</p>

<p>Done is better than perfect. When I wrote my first computer program, I tried to squeeze my potential to write perfect code. I had madness on useless programming syntax sugar, and was crazy on learning new programming languages. The stranger the syntax, the better; the fewer lines of code, the better. If not naturally, it was still very likely, the project was delayed, a lot.</p>

<p>Thank goddess, finally I overcome my madness and learned that a reliable running project is much more important than the language and the syntax. Don’t take me wrong, I’m not saying I can finally endure shit code. My point is that the reliability and robustness are the goal, I should always have good progress towards the destination.</p>

<p>Then why can’t I upgrade my attitude on writing? What’s my purpose to write? Is it beautiful novels or poems? Ninety nine percent not. I write because it records. There is no matter on whether words gorgeous or not, it just need to keep my thoughts correctly as what I actually think. Even if they are scraped together by random thoughts.</p>

<p>Deliver without fault.</p>

<p>In progress that I dwell.</p>

<p><em>P.S. I’m using VS Code to write now, highly recommended.</em></p>
