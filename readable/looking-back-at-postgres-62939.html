      <span>Abstract:</span>  This is a recollection of the UC Berkeley Postgres project, which was led by
Mike Stonebraker from the mid-1980's to the mid-1990's. The article was
solicited for Stonebraker's Turing Award book, as one of many
personal/historical recollections. As a result it focuses on Stonebraker's
design ideas and leadership. But Stonebraker was never a coder, and he stayed
out of the way of his development team. The Postgres codebase was the work of a
team of brilliant students and the occasional university "staff programmers"
who had little more experience (and only slightly more compensation) than the
students. I was lucky to join that team as a student during the latter years of
the project. I got helpful input on this writeup from some of the more senior
students on the project, but any errors or omissions are mine. If you spot any
such, please contact me and I will try to fix them.
