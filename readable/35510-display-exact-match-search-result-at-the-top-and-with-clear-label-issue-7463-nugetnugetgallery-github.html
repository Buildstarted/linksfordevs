This means searches on nuget.org and in Visual Studio in non-China should have this first fix.</p><p>When a search query has an exact match <em>and</em> the  package ID contains symbols (dot <code>.</code>, underscore <code>_</code>, hyphen <code>-</code>) then that package is at the top.</p><p>Regarding package IDs without symbols, we chose not to put that one always at the top yet because:</p><ol><li>A lot of our top queries have low download count exact match "false positives". Without clear UI saying "this is at the top because exact match only" our telemetry and user feedback indicates that we shouldn't do this one yet.</li><li>We don't have our A/B testing infrastructure for search changes ready yet so we wanted to avoid changes that we are less confident about.</li><li>All of the exact match issues reported since we shipped new search were concerning package IDs with dots. In other words, this small fix covers the reported pain points.</li></ol><p>To be clear, exact match means that the search query exactly matches a package ID. If the query is "system text json", System.Text.Json isn't <em>necessarily</em> at the top but, in this case, it is for other scoring reasons. If there are two package IDs in the search query or a prefix of a package ID the improvement I made does not apply. Other relevancy changes are planned to improve these non-exact match cases but they are less urgent.</p><p>As always, we warmly welcome input on how we are doing. For the exact match case, please feel free to chime in here. For other search relevancy issues, please respond to <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="235720662" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4124" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4124/hovercard" href="https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/4124">#4124</a>.</p><p>This issue tracks the UI work and putting all exact matches at the top so I will leave it open until we do that. Note the UI is a little challenging because we are thinking about all of the other "markers" or "badges" that may be on a search result so we want to make a UI change that gels well.</p></div></div></div></div>
