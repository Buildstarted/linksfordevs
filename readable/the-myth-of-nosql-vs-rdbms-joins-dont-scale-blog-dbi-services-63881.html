<h2>By Franck Pachot</h2>
<p>.<br>
I’ll reference <a href="https://twitter.com/alexbdebrie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alex DeBrie</a> article “<a href="https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/dynamodb-no-bad-queries/#sql-joins-have-bad-time-complexity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SQL, NoSQL, and Scale: How DynamoDB scales where relational databases don’t</a>“, especially the paragraph about <em>“Why relational databases don’t scale”</em>. But I want to make clear that my post here is not against this article, but against a very common myth that even precedes NoSQL databases. Actually, I’m taking this article as reference because the author, in his <a href="https://www.dynamodbguide.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="https://www.dynamodbbook.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">book</a>, has really good points about data modeling in NoSQL. And because AWS DynamoDB is probably the strongest NoSQL database today. I’m challenging some widespread assertions and better do it based on good quality content and product.</p>
<p>There are many use cases where NoSQL is a correct alternative, but moving from a relational database system to a key-value store because you heard that “joins don’t scale” is probably not a good reason. You should choose a solution for the features it offers (the problem it solves), and not because you ignore what you current platform is capable of.</p>
<h3><em>time complexity of joins</em></h3>
<p>The idea in this article, taken from the popular Rick Houlihan talk, is that, by joining tables, you read more data. And that it is a CPU intensive operation. And the time complexity of joins is <em>“( O (M + N) ) or worse”</em> according to Alex DeBrie article or “<em>O(log(N))+Nlog(M)</em>” according to Rick Houlihan slide. This makes reference to “time complexity” and “Big O” notation. You can read about it. But this supposes that the cost of a join depends on the size of the tables involved (represented by N and M). That would be right with non-partitioned table full scan. But all relational databases come with B*Tree indexes. And when we compare to a key-value store we are obviously retrieving few rows and the join method will be a Nested Loop with Index Range Scan. This access method is actually not dependent at all on the size of the tables. That’s why relational database are the king of OTLP applications.</p>
<h3>Let’s test it</h3>
<p>The article claims that <em>“there’s one big problem with relational databases: performance is like a black box. There are a ton of factors that impact how quickly your queries will return.”</em> with an example on a query like: <em>“SELECT * FROM orders JOIN users ON … WHERE user.id = … GROUP BY … LIMIT 20”</em>. It says that <em>“As the size of your tables grow, these operations will get slower and slower.”</em></p>
<p>I will build those tables, in PostgreSQL here, because that’s my preferred Open Source RDBMS, and show that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance is <strong>not</strong> a black box: all RDBMS have an EXPLAIN command that display exactly the algorithm used (even CPU and memory access) and you can estimate the cost easily from it.</li>
<li>Join and Group By here do <strong>not</strong> depend on the size of the table at all but only the rows selected. You will multiply your tables by several orders of magnitude before the number of rows impact the response time by a 1/10s of millisecond.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Create the tables</h3>
<p>I will create small tables here. Because when reading the execution plan, I don’t need large tables to estimate the cost and the response-time scalability. You can run the same with larger tables if you want to see how it scales. And then maybe investigate further the features for big tables (partitioning, parallel query,…). But let’s start with very simple tables without specific optimization.</p>
<pre><code>
	iming
create table USERS ( USER_ID bigserial primary key, FIRST_NAME text, LAST_NAME text)
;
CREATE TABLE
create table ORDERS ( ORDER_ID bigserial primary key, ORDER_DATE timestamp, AMOUNT numeric(10,2), USER_ID bigint, DESCRIPTION text)
;</code></pre>
<p>I have created the two tables that I’ll join. Both with an auto-generated primary key for simplicity.</p>
<h3>Insert test data</h3>
<p>It is important to build the table as they would be in real life. USERS probably come without specific order. ORDERS come by date. This means that ORDERS from one USER are scattered throughout the table. The query would be much faster with clustered data, and each RDBMS has some ways to achieve this, but I want to show the cost of joining two tables here without specific optimisation.</p>
<pre><code>
insert into  USERS (FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME)

  random_words as (

  select generate_series id,
   translate(md5(random()::text),'-0123456789','aeioughij') as word

</code></pre>
<p>I have now one million orders generated as 100 orders for each users in the last year. You can play with the numbers to generate more and see how it scales. This is fast: 5 seconds to generate 1 million orders here, and there are many way to load faster if you feel the need to test on very large data sets. But the point is not there.</p>
<pre><code>
create index ORDERS_BY_USER on ORDERS(USER_ID);
CREATE INDEX
Time: 316.322 ms
alter table ORDERS add constraint ORDERS_BY_USER foreign key (USER_ID) references USERS;
ALTER TABLE
Time: 194.505 ms
</code></pre>
<p>As, in my data model, I want to navigate from USERS to ORDERS I add an index for it. And I declare the referential integrity to avoid logical corruptions in case there is a bug in my application, or a human mistake during some ad-hoc fixes. As soon as the constraint is declared, I have no need to check this assertion in my code anymore. The constraint also informs the query planner know about this one-to-many relationship as it may open some optimizations. That’s the relational database beauty: we declare those things rather than having to code their implementation. </p>

<p>Here are the sizes of my tables: The 1 million orders take 104MB and the 10 thousand users is 1MB. I’ll increase it later, but I don’t need this to understand the performance predictability.</p>
<p>When understanding the size, remember that the size of the table is only the size of data. Metadata (like column names) are not repeated for each row. They are stored once in the RDBMS catalog describing the table. As PostgreSQL has a native JSON datatype you can also test with a non-relational model here.</p>

<p>Here is the query mentioned in the article: get all orders for one user, and do some aggregation on them. Looking at the time is not really interesting as it depends on the RAM to cache the buffers at database or filesystem level, and disk latency. But we are developers and, by looking at the operations and loops that were executed, we can understand how it scales and where we are in the “time complexity” and “Big O” order of magnitude.</p>
<h3>Explain the execution</h3>

</code></pre>
<p>Here is the execution plan with the execution statistics. We have read 3 pages from USERS to get our USER_ID (Index Only Scan) and navigated, with Nested Loop, to ORDERS and get the 100 orders for this user. This has read 3 pages from the index (Bitmap Index Scan) and 13 pages from the table. That’s a total of 19 pages. Those pages are 8k blocks.</p>
<h3>4x initial size scales with same performance: 19 page reads</h3>
<p>Let’s increase the size of the tables by a factor 4. I change the “generate_series(1,100)” to “generate_series(1,200)” in the USERS generations and run the same. That generates 40000 users and 4 million orders.</p>

<p>Look how we scaled here: I multiplied the size of the tables by 4x and I have exactly the same cost: 3 pages from each index and 13 from the table. This is the beauty of B*Tree: the cost depends only on the height of the tree and not the size of the table. And you can increase the table exponentially before the height of the index increases.</p>
<h3>16x initial size scales with 21/19=1.1 cost factor</h3>
<p>Let’s go further and x4 the size of the tables again. I run with “generate_series(1,400)” in the USERS generations and run the same. That generates 160 thousand users and 16 million orders.</p>

<p>Yes, by increasing the table size a lot the index may have to split the root block to add a new branch level. The consequence is minimal: two additional pages to read here. The additional execution time is in tens of microseconds when cached in RAM, up to milliseconds if from mechanical disk. With 10x or 100x larger tables, you will do some physical I/O and only the top index branches will be in memory. You can expect about about 20 I/O calls then. With SSD on Fiber Channel (like with AWS RDS PostgreSQL for example), this will still be in single-digit millisecond. The cheapest AWS EBS Provisioned IOPS for RDS is 1000 IOPS then you can estimate the number of queries per second you can run. The number of pages here (“Buffers”) is the right metric to estimate the cost of the query. To be compared with DynamoDB RCU. </p>
<h3>64x initial size scales with 23/19=1.2 cost factor</h3>
<p>Last test for me, but you can go further, I change to “generate_series(1,800)” in the USERS generations and run the same. That generates 640 thousand users and 64 million orders.</p>

<p>You see how the cost increases slowly, with two additional pages to read here.</p>
<p>Please, test with more rows. When looking at the time (less than 1 millisecond), keep in mind that it is CPU time here as all pages are in memory cache. On purpose, because the article mentions CPU and RAM (<em>“joins require a lot of CPU and memory”</em>). Anyway, 20 disk reads will still be within the millisecond on modern storage.<br>

<h3>Time complexity of B*Tree is actually very light</h3>
<p>Let’s get back to the “Big O” notation. We are definitely not “O (M + N)”. This would have been without any index, where all pages from all tables would have been full scanned. Any database maintains hashed or sorted structures to improve high selectivity queries. This has nothing to do with SQL vs. NoSQL or with RDBMS vs. Hierarchichal DB. In DynamoDB this structure on primary key is HASH partitioning (and additional sorting). In RDBMS the most common structure is a sorted index (with the possibility of additional partitioning, zone maps, clustering,…). We are not in “O(log(N))+Nlog(M)” but more like “O(log(N))+log(M)” because the size of the driving table (N) has nothing to do on the inner loop cost. The first filtering, the one with “O(log(N))”, has filtered out those N rows. Using “N” and ignoring the outer selectivity is a mistake. Anyway, this O(log) for B*Tree is really scalable as we have seen because the base of this log() function is really small (thanks to large branch blocks – 8KB).</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is not there. As you have seen, the cost of Nested Loop is in the blocks that are fetched from the inner loop, and this depends on the selectivity and the clustering factor (the table physical order correlation with the index order), and some prefetching techniques. This O(log) for going through the index is often insignificant on Range Scans.</p>
<h3>40 years of RDBMS optimizations</h3>
<p>If you have a database size that is several order of magnitude from those million rows, and where this millisecond latency is a problem, the major RDBMS offer many features and structures to go further in performance and predictability of response time. As we have seen, the cost of this query is not about Index, Nested Loop or Group By. It is about the scattered items: ingested by date but queried by user.</p>
<p>Through its 40 years of optimizing OLTP applications, the <strong>Oracle Database</strong> have a lot of features, with their popularity depending on the IT trends. From the first versions, in the 80’s, because the hierarchical databases were still in people’s mind, and the fear of “joins are expensive” was already there, Oracle has implemented a structure to store the tables together, pre-joined. This is called <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/20/sqlrf/CREATE-CLUSTER.html#GUID-4DBC701F-AFC3-486D-AA32-B5CB1D6946F7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CLUSTER</a>. It was, from the beginning, indexed with a sorted structure (INDEX CLUSTER) or a hashed structure (HASH CLUSTER). Parallel Query was quickly implemented to scale-up and, with Parallel Server now known as RAC, to scale-out. Partitioning was introduced to scale further, again with sorted (PARTITION by RANGE) or hashed (PARTITION BY HASH) segments. This can scale further the index access (LOCAL INDEX with partition pruning). And it also scales joins (PARTITION-WISE JOIN) to reduce CPU and RAM to join large datasets. When more agility was needed, B*Tree sorted structures were the winner and Index Organized Tables were introduced to cluster data (to avoid the most expensive operation as we have seen in the examples above). But Heap Tables and B*Tree are still the winners given their agility and because the Join operations were rarely a bottleneck. Currently, partitioning has improved (even scaling horizontally beyond the clusters with sharding), as well as data clustering (<a href="https://blog.dbi-services.com/oracle-12c-clustering/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Attribute Clustering</a>, Zone Maps and Storage Index). And there’s always the possibility for Index Only access, just by adding more columns to the index, removing the major cost of table access. And materialized views can also act as <a href="https://blog.dbi-services.com/oracle-index-on-joins/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pre-built join index</a> and will also reduce the CPU and RAM required for GROUP BY aggregation.</p>
<p>I listed a lot of Oracle features, but Microsoft <strong>SQL Server</strong> has also many similar features. Clustered tables, covering indexes, Indexed Views, and of course partitioning. Open source databases are evolving a lot. <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> has partitioning, parallel query, clustering,.. Still Open Source, you can web-scale it to a distributed database with <strong>YugabyteDB</strong>. <strong>MySQL</strong> is evolving a lot recently. I’ll not list all databases and all features. You can port the testcase to other databases easily.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, if you want to test it on <strong>Oracle Database</strong> you will quickly realize that the query from the article may not even do any Join operation. Because when you query with the USER_ID you probably don’t need to get back to the USERS table. And thanks to the declared foreign key, the optimizer knows that the join is not necessary: <a href="https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=oracle_18&amp;fiddle=a5afeba2fdb27dec7533545ab0a6eb0e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=oracle_18&amp;fiddle=a5afeba2fdb27dec7533545ab0a6eb0e</a>.</p>
<p>NoSQL databases are good for many use-cases. But remember that it is a key-value optimized data store. When you start to split a document into multiple entities with their own keys, remember that relational databases were invented for that. I blogged about another myth recently: <a href="https://blog.dbi-services.com/the-myth-of-nosql-vs-rdbms-agility-adding-attributes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The myth of NoSQL (vs. RDBMS) agility: adding attributes</a>.
