<h5><strong>Debug C++ Without Running</strong> by Anastasia Kazakova</h5>
<p>In this talk we'll see interesting approaches to solving cases like macro and typedef 'debug', understanding types when auto/decltype hide them, dealing with different code branches depending on the preprocessor's pass-through, and other ideas. The aim of this talk is to share the workflows supported by the tools that can help C++ developers create better modern C++ code.<br></p>

<h5><strong>LINQ - Language Integrated Query. Exploring the parts LINQ is made of</strong> by&nbsp;Shachar Grauman</h5>
<p>LINQ changed (forever) the way we code.<br>It allows us to write complex, but declarative, data manipulations within a few lines.<br>It was so revolutionary, back then in 2007, that it toed the line for all other languages.<br>Nevertheless, writing LINQ may be rather simple, but understanding the in-and-outs will<br>give you the power to really understand what's going on and better architect your code.<br>Including topics:<br>var,<br>Automatic Properties,<br>Object/Collection Initializers,<br>Anonymous Classes,<br>Extension Methods,<br>Delegates,<br>Generic Delegates,<br>Lambda Expression,<br>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;<br>Hi LINQ!<br></p>

<h5><strong>Can you make me productive with a C++ IDE?</strong>&nbsp;By Anastasia Kazakova</h5>
<p>Writing code at the speed of thought and having the IDE take care of all mundane development tasks – that’s what productivity means for us at JetBrains. But is it even possible for a tricky language like C++? In this talk we’ll explore CLion, a cross-platform IDE for C and C++ development.<br></p>

<h5><strong>IntelliJ IDEA tips &amp; tricks</strong> by Piotr Tomiak</h5>
<p>Every day a frontend developer uses a dozen of various tools: linters, task runners, debugger, version control, not to mention all the frameworks and libraries. In this talk, I will explain how to set up your development workflow in IntelliJ IDEA in the most productive way and use these tools more efficiently in the IDE. I’ll also give a crash course on using the editor, navigating around the project, using Git in the IDE, and much more.</p>


<p>This talk is targeted at all levels of users of WebStorm, IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, or any other JetBrains IDEs.&nbsp;</p>

<h5><strong>TeamCity build pipelines</strong> by Anton Arhipov</h5>
<p>TeamCity is a great tool for Continuous Integration with a lot of advanced features provided out-of-the-box. In this session, we will go through how TeamCity helps the software development with the daily routine; what was added to the product in the latest releases; and what features are coming next.<br></p>

<p>You will learn why build pipelines are useful, and how the CI server can be optimized when properly configured. I will also demonstrate how to configure the builds using the special Kotlin DSL provided with TeamCity.</p>

<h5><strong>On types and classes in Kotlin</strong> by Paweł Marks</h5>
<p>Since the beginning of the JVM, the classes are the most basic building blocks of every Java application. Languages such as Scala and later Kotlin introduced much more robust type systems. In my talk I would like to explain the often overlooked difference between the concepts of class and type and present the foundations of the Kotlin type system. I will show how the type system can be leveraged to make our code more expressive and safe. At the end of the day I want everyone to be aware of the limitations of the Java types and the ways that we can deal with those flaws, thanks to Kotlin.<br></p>

<h5><strong>IntelliJ IDEA tips &amp; tricks</strong> by Anton Arhipov</h5>
<p>Does this sound familiar to you: your colleague is trying to find a class in the project tree, and they have completely forgotten the name of the class? It can be hard not to scream at them “Just press Ctrl+Shift+E!!!“*</p>

<p>This is the reality of it though, modern IDEs are quite complex and contain some incredible inbuilt features, but if you don’t know about these features, then how can you be expected to use them. Even experienced IDE developers often say they sometimes only discover new features while reading the IDE’s code.</p>

<p>Generally, developers are only scratching the surface of the capabilities of their IDE and often they are missing out on utilizing the power of automated refactorings, shortcuts, fast navigation, and other awesome features that are provided by an IDE.</p>

<p>In this talk, the audience will be introduced to a lot of tips and tricks and different shortcuts which will help them to get the most out of their IDEs.</p>

<h5><strong>Performance tests - it’s a trap!</strong> By Andrzej Ludwikowski</h5>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are from the world of JVM, .Net, PHP or elsewhere. If you need to test the performance - it is a challenging task, especially nowadays, with microservices architectures, clusters, and very complex systems. I would like to address the most common pitfalls in this area. Share my experience gained through experimentation and quite often frustrating failures. Although most of the examples come from the JVM world, this presentation aims to give insight into some universal problems, laws, and best practices that rule over this very specific kind of testing.<br></p>

                                    Mikhail Vink / Hadi Hariri<p>
                                    An IDE is so much more than an editor, yet people still seem to compare one
                                    to another. This session looks at IntelliJ IDEA and shows tips and tricks that will
                                    make you a more efficient and productive developer (most of the tips’n’tricks
                                    are also applicable to all IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs, such as WebStorm, PhpStorm,
                                    PyCharm, and others). From searching for symbols to having a smooth workflow
                                    when working with version control, the presentation examines all the aspects
                                    that make it possible to have a pleasurable development experience. You’re
                                    guaranteed to leave this session knowing things you probably didn’t even know
                                    existed and were afraid to ask whether they did.
