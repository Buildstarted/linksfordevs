In the beginning of software engineering, the old problematic mathematical style was copied into software engineering, but in modern software engineering, especially in teamwork, it is increasingly recognized that it is bad practice to obscurely name variables, parameters, or fields as "q1" and "q2" instead of something meaningful such as "remainingDistance" and "estimatedDistance".</p><p>In the past, "q1" and "q2" were viewed as intelligent because people thought:<br><em>"I understand nothing of what he wrote therefore he must be super intelligent.  The more complex and difficult it is to understand, the smarter it must be.  When I write something, I'll likewise write it in a way that is impressively obscure and complex."</em></p><p>Nowadays the attitude in professional software engineering is increasingly becoming like this:<br><em>"Obscure names such as q1 and q2 cause difficulties for team members / coworkers and long-term maintainability of code.  Our team runs better when the code is clear and easy to understand, as much as possible/practical.  Whenever possible, a simple-but-effective solution is impressive and intelligent.  Artificial complexity causes problems such as increased rate of mistakes/bugs, additional cost and delay to produce the next version, and difficulty transferring code between coworkers."</em></p><p>I was shocked when I heard a university mathematics professor say <em>proudly</em>:<br><em>"And this is exactly the same today as it was 200 years ago!"</em></p><p>I was shocked because he said it with pride and joy, whereas I thought:<br><em>"Aren't you the least bit embarrassed about having made no progress, no advancements, no improvements during the last 200 years?  I'd reconsider before I'd proudly announce no changes after 200 years."</em></p><p>My point is, we are software engineers not mathematics professors, therefore let's design BigInteger.Builder to suit modern professional software engineering practices, not to suit badly-written math textbooks that torment poor university students year after year after year.</p></div></div></div></div>
