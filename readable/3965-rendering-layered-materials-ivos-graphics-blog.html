However, it turned out that their model is more ad-hoc and practically oriented. So I decided to come up with my own solution which would be heavily inspired by the ideas from the original paper, but built on a more theoretical foundation so that some weaknesses of a practically oriented approach could be overcome.</p><p>I decided to restrict the model to just two layers, instead of the original paper’s general approach with arbitrary amount of layers. This decision simplifies both theory and implementation while still having the rich expressivity of a layered model. In my explanation I will ignore the fact that there can be more than two layers in the original model.</p><p>Since the amount of resulting text grew fairly large, I decided to split it into several parts:</p></div></div></div></div>
