Early sprite artwork for Super Mario World and others also appears to have leaked online.</p><p>The videos claiming to show prototype versions of Yoshi’s Island are the most significant, showcasing entirely new UI and levels. One prototype for Mario World 2 – called “Super Donkey” – shows an entirely new character in a forest environment.</p><p>According to an anonymous post on the 4chan forum, the leak also includes the source code for F-Zero, <a title="Games > The Legend of Zelda (Series)" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-series/">Legend of Zelda</a>: A Link to the Past, Super Mario RPG, Super Mario All-Stars, Link’s Awakening DX, Star Fox 2, Wild Trax and <a title="Games > Pokémon video games" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/games/pokemon/">Pokémon</a> Diamond and Pearl.</p><p>The leak is also said to include data for the Wii Shop Channel, a Wii Game Boy emulator, China’s iQUE service and more.</p><div><div
