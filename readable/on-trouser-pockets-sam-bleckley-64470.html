<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>The clothing industry rarely creates dramatically new patterns. It is&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span>more lucrative to make small, easy-to-manufacture changes that always&nbsp;</span><span>use the same basic pattern.</span></p>

<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>There is therefore lots of room to innovate clothing that is more&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>appropriate for contemporary problems, because basic clothing&nbsp;</span><span>patterns haven’t changed in decades.</span></p>

<p><span>I made some trousers with unusual pockets, and I think they’re good.</span></p>

<h3 id="pockets-are-either-ugly-or-useless">Pockets are either ugly or useless</h3>

<p><span>Pockets in tight jeans look bad. Putting a modern slab phone, a wallet,&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span>and keys into a pair of skinny jeans will leave even the most fashionable&nbsp;</span><span>figure looking looking like they’re wearing batman’s utility belt as unde</span><span>-</span><span></span><span>rwear. Even empty, in tight pants a large pocket bag can show through.</span></p>

<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>The alternative, as many women know from first-hand experience, is a&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>pocket too small to put anything in.</span></p>

<p>A wallet in the back pocket can cause back pain and bad posture.</p>

<p><span></span><span></span><span>Many of us spend most of our time sitting, but all four traditional&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>pockets are totally inaccessible in that position. So we take out our&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>phone, just in case, before we sit down at the restaurant — guarant</span><span>-</span><span></span><span></span><span>eeing a distraction.</span></p>

<p><span></span><span></span><span>Aesthetics, storage, and access: these are user needs that are currently&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span>poorly fulfilled — and that means things are ripe for innovation.</span></p>

<h3 id="a-brief-history">A brief history</h3>

<p><span></span><span></span><span>If the space is so ripe, why has there been no pocket innovation recently?</span><span></span></p>

<p><span>Women used to have pockets. That “used to” has to count back 150&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>or even 200 years, and those pockets were often a separate garment,&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>either worn underneath and accessed through a slit in the dress, or&nbsp;</span><span>worn around the hips overtop, rather than built into the dress directly&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>— but regardless, “it has pockets!” as a joyous surprise is a modern&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span>invention. (Men’s pockets were also separate pouches if you go back&nbsp;</span><span>far enough; but going back the same 150-200 years, they lived in the&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>waistcoat and the mandatory jacket; if breeches had pockets they were&nbsp;</span><span>behind the falls and so, I suspect, not used as much in public.)</span></p>

<p><span></span><span>The 1880’s brought the 1940s brought the slow arrival of mass produc</span><span>-</span><span></span><span>tion to clothing — not of the textiles, which started much earlier, but&nbsp;</span><span>of actual clothes. Before this era, clothes were made either at home, or&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>they were made one at a time. (In a quiet resonance with today, this was&nbsp;</span><span>done in part by women who worked almost entirely from home, only&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>travelling to the workplace to pick up new work and drop off what had&nbsp;</span><span>been completed).</span></p>

<p><span></span><span></span><span>In retrospect, fashions changed mostly decade by decade rather than&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>year by year, but they changed dramatically. The fashionable silhouette&nbsp;</span><span>of the 1860s looks nothing like the 1880s, or the 1910’s — so different,&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>in fact, that for women the foundation garments were completely&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>unrelated entities: the crinoline of the 1860s is nothing like the bustle&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span>of the 1880s. A person who can cut and sew can sew an incredibly wide&nbsp;</span><span>range of different things; why not play around?</span></p>

<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>But with the advent of mass production in clothes factories, the whole&nbsp;</span><span>layout of the factory floor was based on specific pattern piecing. Each&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>station makes only a few operations on each garment, and garments&nbsp;</span><span>flow from one station to the next. To completely change the </span><em><span></span><span></span><span>construction</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span><span>of a garment means a radical overhaul of the whole assembly line.</span></p>

<p>But to simply change the garment’s <em>proportions</em> is <em>easy</em>.</p>

<p><span>And so we live in a world where every spring the morning talk shows&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>invite someone on to say “this year, [culottes, boot-cuts, skinny jeans,&nbsp;</span><span>flares, cuffs, boyfriend jeans, high waists, low-rise, acid-wash, raw&nbsp;</span><span>denim] are coming back into fashion, so keep your eye out!” — but&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>the trousers are made from the same basic pieces, constructed in the&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span>same ways, with only the measurements changing. They get longer or&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>shorter, looser or tighter, and change color, but they’re not fundament</span><span>-</span><span>ally </span><em><span>different</span></em><span>.</span></p>

<p><span></span><span></span><span>It’s like a lack-luster procedural generation system. Sure, there are tech</span><span>-</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>nically millions of possibilities, but somehow you still end up bored&nbsp;</span><span>after seeing the first 5 or 6.</span></p>

<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>Probably not coincidentally, the advent of mass production is also&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span>when women’s silhouettes turned slim, and when all those foundation&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span>garments mostly disappeared. Designs that banish structure from the&nbsp;</span><span>garment and rely entirely on the body beneath are much easier and&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>cheaper to manufacture.</span></p>

<p><span></span><span>And when silhouettes turned slim, women lost pockets. The more body-</span><span></span><span>hugging the clothing, the less room for pockets — or, rather, the more&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>the pocket contents will show unflatteringly. (And as we know, it would&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span>be anathema for a women to show unflattering lump for something as&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>silly as practicality, function, or utility.)</span></p>

<p><span></span><span>And even as womenswear adopted men’s workwear styles, women got&nbsp;</span><span>jeans but not the pockets to go with them. Spandex made it even easier&nbsp;</span><span>to make mass-produced clothes “fit”, and fit tighter. The unsightly-</span><span>lump factor wasn’t going away.</span></p>

<p><span></span><span></span><span>Even more recently, menswear has returned to an incredibly slim silhou</span><span>-</span><span>ette. Guys in skinny jeans should, by this logic, not have pockets either.&nbsp;</span><span>But they do.</span></p>

<p>Women get no practicality and men get no grace.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-we-redesigned-the-pocket-from-scratch">What if we redesigned the pocket from scratch?</h3>

<p><span>Let’s design a trouser pocket! This process is going to land somewhere&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>between UX and industrial design. I am, sadly, not in charge of a&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>clothes factory, so I am not concerned with the problems of mass-</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>production, but material properties and the construction process do&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span>still matter; but I am maybe more willing to make manufacturing sacri</span><span>-</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>fices for usefulness than most industrial designers are able to be.</span></p>

<h3 id="what-do-people-use-pockets-for">What do people use pockets for?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Storing things; most often phone, then keys, wallet or money-clip, and other small items. At the moment, a mask.</li>
  <li><em>Verifying</em> stored objects — the hip-slapping dance of making sure you have everything before walking out the door.</li>
  <li>They must be secure while standing, sitting, running for the bus, etc</li>
  <li>Things, especially phone, need to go in and out of storage frequently, almost unconsciously.</li>
  <li>Access to phone while seated in a restaurant; to keys and license while in car</li>
  <li>Aesthetically, we want a clean, graceful line from hip to ankle even while holding things.</li>
</ul>

<p>An initial solution can be based on just three questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where can your hands reach?</li>
  <li>Where is there extra space to put things?</li>
  <li>Where is there enough support to prevent items swinging around uncomfortably?</li>
</ul>

<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>These questions form a physical venn diagram, pointing at a pretty&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>small area for investigation:</span></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/pocket_venn.png" alt="The human body with overlapping regions of reach, space, and support."></p>

<p><span>You can see that current pockets are located completely outside the&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>area where there is potentially space; the hips and butt of modern pants,&nbsp;</span><span>for both women and men, are closely fitted. If there’s any ease, it starts&nbsp;</span><span>just above the knees.</span></p>

<p><span></span><span></span><span>Conveniently, the point where the vastus lateralis starts to curve back&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>in towards the knee, creating space, is also right around the lowest&nbsp;</span><span>point your arms can reach without bending over, giving us a well-</span><span>defined target.</span></p>

<p><span>So I made a pair of trousers with no pockets at the waist, and a pair of&nbsp;</span><span>welt pockets at the side seams, right at that point.</span></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/pants1.jpg" alt="First pair of pants."></p>

<h3 id="notes-from-user-testing">Notes from user testing:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A pocket needs to be big enough for a whole hand, not just phone, to allow for fishing out small items from the very bottom of the pocket-bag.</li>
  <li>The pocket bag slips down and back if it’s full and the wearer sits down. This is uncomfortable and</li>
  <li>The pocket mustn’t allow a slick round phone to fall out when sitting, especially when, e.g. jiggling a leg.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="revisions">Revisions</h3>
<p><span></span><span>Luckily, each of these notes point at simple revision, rather than the&nbsp;</span><span>need to start again.</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Make the pockets wider.</li>
  <li>Anchor the bottom of the pocket bag to the side seam.</li>
  <li>Angle the opening so it’s higher in the back — this both makes it easier to slip a phone into the pocket, and makes the pocket “deeper” on the bottom side when sitting or crouching.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/pants2.jpg" alt="Second pair of pants."></p>

<h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3>

<p><span>These are great. I completely forget my phone and wallet are there —&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>they don’t restrict my movement, they’re completely invisible, and yet&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>they’re easy to access while standing or sitting. There’s no temptation&nbsp;</span><span>to slouch around with my hands stuffed in my pockets. They’re so&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>straightforwardly better for my needs that I’m now frustrated when&nbsp;</span><span>my new-pocket pants are dirty and I have to wear trousers with pockets&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>that are just SO twentieth-century. I immediately made a pair of jeans&nbsp;</span><span>in this pattern, too.</span></p>

<p><span></span><span>Further revision is possible, of course; but while it will be easy to refine&nbsp;</span><span>this design to suit my personal body and needs more precisely, there’s&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span>only so much refinement possible while remaining suitable for a wide&nbsp;</span><span>range of body types. If you wanted to mass-produce a pocket like this,&nbsp;</span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>you’d want to use something like Dreyfuss’ Humanscale data to make&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>sure the placement and size is appropriate for the widest range of&nbsp;</span><span>people. Luckily, you’d have </span><em><span>some</span></em><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span> additional information in the sizing&nbsp;</span><span>of the </span><em><span>rest</span></em><span> of the pants.</span></p>

<h3 id="appendix-sam-have-you-simply-invented-cargo-pants">Appendix: Sam, have you simply invented cargo pants?</h3>

<p>No. Cargo pants solve different problems for different people.</p>

<p><span></span><span>If cargo pants are appropriate for your daily life, you definitely don’t&nbsp;</span><span>want or need my side-seam welt pockets; and vice-versa. Cargo pants&nbsp;</span><span>aren’t office-wear; these dress pants aren’t combat-wear.</span></p>
