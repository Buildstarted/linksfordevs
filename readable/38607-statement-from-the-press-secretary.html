    <h1>Statement from the Press Secretary</h1>

</aside> <p>Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey by telephone. Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria. The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial &#x201C;Caliphate,&#x201D; will no longer be in the immediate area.</p>
<p>The United States Government&#xA0;has pressed France, Germany, and other European nations, from which many captured ISIS fighters came, to take them back, but they did not want them and refused. The United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer. Turkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial &#x201C;Caliphate&#x201D; by the United States.</p> </div>
