Lots of folks have written about this, but one of my favorite blog post on the matter is <a href="https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">written by Dan Luu</a>. In it, he links to a <a href="https://twitter.com/rogerdickey/status/1268327765905772546" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter thread</a> where Roger Dickey expresses his “unpopular opinion” that hiring women/minorities is hard because there is a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tech-pipline-problem_n_57f7f15de4b0b6a43031ee34" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pipeline problem</a>. Basically, Roger thinks that there are not enough women or people of color graduating from STEM programs, so there aren’t enough of them starting companies to fund or entering the candidate pool to hire. Here’s my favorite response:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="There’s a pervasive bias in who the industry hires, refers, and invites to parties…" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*3oUas5efjh_hCr9vOi5RlA.png?q=20" width="1204" height="920"></p><p><img alt="There’s a pervasive bias in who the industry hires, refers, and invites to parties…" width="1204" height="920" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1204/1*3oUas5efjh_hCr9vOi5RlA.png" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/276/1*3oUas5efjh_hCr9vOi5RlA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*3oUas5efjh_hCr9vOi5RlA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*3oUas5efjh_hCr9vOi5RlA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*3oUas5efjh_hCr9vOi5RlA.png 700w" sizes="700px"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="4b98" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>There’s a pervasive bias in who the industry hires, refers, and invites to parties…</em></p><p id="15ff" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let me tell you a story.</p><p id="ca3b" data-selectable-paragraph="">I used to work for a company (let’s call it Hooli), where recruiters would go on tour to various universities each fall with the hopes of recruiting some shiny new college grads. At some point they were going to colleges in my home state of North Carolina to do the usual: give some presentations, get the students excited about Hooli’s mission, something about #impact and whatnot. One of the colleges on the itinerary was North Carolina A&amp;T, <a href="https://www.ncpedia.org/north-carolina-agricultural-and-tec" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a historically black college/university</a>, and a <a href="https://ripplematch.com/journal/article/the-top-hbcus-with-the-best-computer-science-programs-80fd3f5e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">damn good one</a>. Since I was one of only <strong>3</strong> black engineers in the Hooli office and a Carolina Boy, the recruiting team insisted that I accompany them on this leg of the tour. Free trip to NC? Count me in.</p><p id="9c7e" data-selectable-paragraph="">The first recruiting event was for Duke/UNC students and consisted of a 1-hour presentation which covered life at Hooli, various teams that exist, what the interview process is like, how to prepare for the interview, and then a slide containing the recruiter’s contact info. This was then followed by a 1.5 hour break-out session where the students formed small (~5 person) groups and then had a chance to ask a Hooli engineer at their table anything they want over a <strong><em>catered dinner</em></strong><em>. </em>This was also a way for them to make a good impression before we collected all of their resumes, marked which ones seemed the most impressive, and <em>invited half of them to dinner at a fancy restaurant the next evening</em>. Wow, talk about rolling out the red carpet!</p><p id="b97b" data-selectable-paragraph="">The second recruiting event was the following afternoon at NC A&amp;T. Recruiters <strong>put out the catering leftovers from the previous night </strong>and rushed through a shortened (30 minute) version of the previous night’s presentation. There were no break-out tables, no resume collection, no recruiter contact details... I personally ordered a bunch of pizzas because nobody thought that this was a problem. I was <em>livid</em>. After the pizzas arrived, recruiters handed out some Hooli swag, encouraged everyone to apply, and packed up so that everyone could make the 2-hour drive back to Durham in time for a <em>second</em> dinner with the other group of students.</p><p id="e843" data-selectable-paragraph="">Sit with that for a moment.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
