  <p>The British Government has apologised to Sir Elton John and other people given awards in the New Year honours list, after inadvertently posting their addresses online. </p><div>
<div>
  <h2>Key points: </h2><ul><li>The addresses were included in a spreadsheet when the Cabinet Office uploaded the list of recipients</li><li>Sir Elton John and Olivia Newton-John were among those on the honours list</li><li>The Cabinet Office said the addresses had been taken down from the website "as soon as possible"</li></ul></div>
