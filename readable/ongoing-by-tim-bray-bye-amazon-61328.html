<p itemprop="description">May 1<sup>st</sup> was my last day as a VP and Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Web Services, after five years and five months
  of rewarding fun.
  I quit in dismay at Amazon firing whistleblowers who were making noise about warehouse employees frightened of Covid-19.</p>

<p>What with big-tech salaries and share vestings, this will probably cost me over a
  million (pre-tax) dollars, not to mention the best job I’ve ever had, working with awfully good people. So I’m pretty blue.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>What happened</span> · 
Last year, Amazonians on the tech side banded together as
  <a href="https://medium.com/@amazonemployeesclimatejustice">Amazon Employees for Climate Justice</a> (AECJ), first coming to the
  world’s notice with an
  <a href="https://medium.com/@amazonemployeesclimatejustice/public-letter-to-jeff-bezos-and-the-amazon-board-of-directors-82a8405f5e38">open
  letter</a> promoting a shareholders’ resolution calling for dramatic action and leadership from Amazon on the global climate
  emergency. I was one of its 8,702 signatories.<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon#p-1">&nbsp;¶</a></p>

<p>While the resolution got a lot of votes, it didn’t pass. Four months later, 3,000 Amazon tech workers from around the world
  <a href="https://twitter.com/AMZNforClimate/status/1184500462873010177">joined in the Global Climate Strike walkout</a>. The day
  before the walkout, Amazon announced 
  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/19/jeff-bezos-speaks-about-amazon-sustainability-in-washington-dc.html">a large-scale
  plan</a> aimed at making the company part of the climate-crisis solution.  It’s not as though the activists were acknowledged by
  their employer for being forward-thinking; in fact, leaders
  were
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/02/amazon-threatened-fire-employees-speaking-out-climate-change-workers-say">threatened
  with dismissal</a>.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to the Covid-19 era. Stories surfaced of unrest in Amazon warehouses, workers raising alarms about
  being uninformed, unprotected, and frightened. Official statements claimed every possible safety precaution
  was being taken. Then a worker organizing for better safety conditions was fired, and
  <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dm8bx/leaked-amazon-memo-details-plan-to-smear-fired-warehouse-organizer-hes-not-smart-or-articulate">brutally
  insensitive remark</a>s appeared in
  leaked executive meeting notes where the focus was on defending Amazon “talking points”.</p>

<p>Warehouse workers reached out to AECJ for support. They responded by internally promoting
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNxRiOtKkPDoCi3iUe6XPyM0rzYzXezaSc4soA-3jX9SGpOw/viewform">a petition</a> and
  organizing a video call for Thursday April 16 featuring warehouse workers from around the world, with guest activist
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Klein">Naomi Klein</a>.  An announcement sent to internal mailing
  lists on Friday April 10th was apparently the
  flashpoint. Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, two visible AECJ leaders, were fired on the spot that day.  The justifications
  were laughable; it was clear to any reasonable observer that they were turfed for whistleblowing.</p>

<p>Management could have objected to the event, or demanded that outsiders be excluded, or that leadership be represented, or any
  number of other things; there was plenty of time. Instead, they just fired the activists.</p>

<p id="p-3"><span>Snap!</span> · 
At that point I snapped. VPs shouldn’t go publicly rogue, so I escalated through the proper channels and by the
  book. I’m not at liberty to disclose those discussions, but I made many of the arguments appearing in this essay.  I
  think I made them to the appropriate people.<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon#p-3">&nbsp;¶</a></p>

<p>That done, remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised.
  So I resigned.</p>

<p>The victims weren’t abstract entities but real people; here are some of their names:
  Courtney Bowden, Gerald Bryson, Maren Costa, Emily Cunningham, Bashir Mohammed, and Chris Smalls. </p>

<p>I’m sure it’s a coincidence that every one of them is a
  person of color, a woman, or both. Right?</p>

<p>Let’s give one of those names a voice. 
  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/22/tech/amazon-warehouse-bashir-mohamed/index.html">Bashir Mohamed said</a> “They fired me to
  make others scared.” Do you disagree?</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>Adjectives</span> · 
Here are some descriptive phrases you might use to describe the activist-firing.<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon#p-1">&nbsp;¶</a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>“Chickenshit.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Kill the messenger.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Never heard of the Streisand effect.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Designed to create a climate of fear.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Like painting a sign on your forehead saying ‘Either guilty, or has something to hide.’”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Which do you like?</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>What about the warehouses?</span> · 
It’s a matter of fact that workers are saying they’re at risk in the warehouses.  I don’t think
  the media’s done a terribly good job of telling their stories.  I went to the video chat that got Maren and Emily fired, and
  found listening to them moving.  You can listen too if you’d like.  
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s5Aup66EZU">Up on YouTube</a> is another full-day videochat; it’s nine hours long, but
  there’s a table of contents, you can decide whether you want to hear people from Poland, Germany, France, or multiple places in
  the USA.
  Here’s
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/technology/coronavirus-amazon-workers.html">more reportage from the NY Times</a>.<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon#p-2">&nbsp;¶</a></p>

<p>It’s not just workers who are upset.  Here are 
  <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-workers-say-coronavirus-safety-measures-are-missing-despite-what-company-says/">Attorneys-general
  from 14 states speaking out</a>. Here’s the
  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/27/846438983/amazon-warehouse-safety-inadequate-n-y-attorney-general-s-office-says">New York
  State Attorney-general</a> with more detailed complaints. Here’s
  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/24/tech/amazon-france-appeal/index.html">Amazon losing in French courts, twice</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Amazon’s messaging has been urgent that they are prioritizing this issue and putting massive efforts into
  warehouse safety. I actually believe this: I have heard detailed descriptions from people I trust of the intense work and huge
  investments. Good for them; and let’s grant that you don’t turn a supertanker on a dime.</p>

<p>But I believe the worker testimony too.  And at the end of the day, the big problem isn’t the specifics of Covid-19 response.
  It’s that Amazon treats the humans in the warehouses as fungible units of   pick-and-pack potential.
  Only that’s not just Amazon, it’s how 21st-century capitalism is done.</p>

<p>Amazon is exceptionally well-managed and has demonstrated
  great skill at spotting opportunities and building repeatable processes for exploiting them.  It has a corresponding lack of
  vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power.
  If we don’t like certain things Amazon is 
  doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things.  We don’t need to invent anything new; a
  combination of antitrust and living-wage and worker-empowerment legislation, rigorously enforced, offers a clear path
  forward.</p>

<p>Don’t say it can’t be done, because  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52346451">France is doing it</a>.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>Poison</span> · 
Firing whistleblowers isn’t just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free
  markets. It’s evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink that poison.<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon#p-7">&nbsp;¶</a></p>

<p id="p-4"><span>What about AWS?</span> · 
Amazon Web Services (the “Cloud Computing” arm of the company), where I worked, is a different story.  It treats its
  workers humanely, strives for work/life balance, struggles to move the diversity needle (and mostly fails, but so does everyone
  else), and is by and large an ethical organization. I genuinely admire its leadership.<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon#p-4">&nbsp;¶</a></p>

<p>Of course, its workers have power. The average pay is very high, and anyone who’s unhappy can
  walk across the street and get another job paying the same or better.</p>

<p id="p-5"><span>Spot a pattern?</span> · 
At the end of the day, it’s all about power balances. The warehouse workers are weak and getting weaker, what with mass
  unemployment and (in the US) job-linked health insurance. So they’re gonna get treated like crap, because capitalism.  Any
  plausible solution has to start with increasing their collective strength.<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon#p-5">&nbsp;¶</a></p>

<p id="p-6"><span>What’s next?</span> · 
For me?  I don’t know, genuinely haven’t taken time to think about it. I’m sad,  but I’m
  breathing more freely.<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon#p-6">&nbsp;¶</a></p>
