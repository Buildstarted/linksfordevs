 An Arduino Project (Using an Arduino Uno &amp; Arduino Nano) that tries to keep a Ping Pong Ball bouncing with 4 mics.

The thing uses: 
- 2 Arduinos
- 4 Stepping motors
- 4 mics
- stuff

Some words about how it works:
The location is calculated from the time difference between mic pairs (one pair for each axis on the 2-dimensional plate). The noise from the ball hitting the plate is a very loud one; It was surprisingly easy to distinguish it from other sounds. You can talk casually nearby the machine and it won’t be affected.

There is a small analogue circuit to process the signals from the mics. Each mic sets a flip-flop (a thing to store a either a “1” or a “0”, digitally speaking) if it’s amplitude surpasses an adjustable voltage level. An Arduino Nano is watching all the flip-flops and resets them after they all got set (the blue LEDs in the video show the current flip-flop states). The Arduino checks the states as fast as possible, this allows for a reasonable accuracy. Another Arduino then uses this data to tilt the plate in such a way that the ball will – hopefully – not fall down. It uses a PID controlling approach for this.

Some code:
Here’s the Github repo with all the code for this project:

I made the data visualization on the left with Unity. It shows the data points gathered by the 4 mics. The plate is driven by 4 steppers.

Here's a blog entry about the thing:
