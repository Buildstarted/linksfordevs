<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-expanded="false"><p><h4>Top positive review</h4></p><p><i data-hook="review-star-rating-view-point"><span>5.0 out of 5 stars</span></i><span></span><span data-hook="review-title">Absolutely best-in-class switches and build!</span></p><p><span>September 29, 2017</span></p><p><span>I purchased a Blackwidow Ultimate Stealth in 2012 with Cherry MX Brown switches.  I really enjoyed that keyboard more than Cherry MX Blues because I found that the actuation force needed on keys that you hit off-center (like the enter key) was far less.  I found with Blues, under normal lazy typing conditions, I don't really press keys down hard enough to consistently get a response from larger keys like the enter button, but that all changed with the Browns.<p>I ended up donating that Blackwidow for various reasons, but now I have, yet again, a need for a mechanical keyboard and I opted for this one.  This is my first time with the Razer Orange switches and I must say they are a step above the cut with the Cherry switches.</p><p>I've read so many reviews about how Razer has "copied" Cherry MX switches for their own gain but really, after using the brown switches for 4 years, I cannot speak highly enough of Razer's orange switch. It really is delightful to type on these keys!  They are smooth as butter, they require very little effort to type on, yet they benefit from the confidence of a mechanical keystroke.</p><p>I've been typing almost exclusively on membrane-style chicklet keyboards for well over a year now, and by comparison, this mechanical keyboard just blows it out of the water.</p><p>I often do typing speed tests to keep up my muscle memory and with chicklet style keyboards, I tend to max out at about 95 wpm with a 90% accuracy.  My first night with this keyboard and I averaged 115wpm at a 97% accuracy over several races.  These keyboards are truly not a fad, they really make a difference!</p><p>Of course, while gaming, it's great to have the larger key height and active feedback of a keypress so I know that I've done what I intend in the game. It's amazing how much more I have to pay attention to the key presses on a chicklet style keyboard versus this one.</p><p>I cannot say enough about this key switch from Razer.  The oranges really are the way to go if you want something quieter and easier on the fingers!</p></span></p></div></div></div>
