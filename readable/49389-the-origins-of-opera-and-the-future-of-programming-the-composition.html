In the middle are points about mental models: how important and how difficult they are. But first, a story of the origins of Opera.</p><h1 id="e5d3" class="gz ha ds ba az hb du hc dw hd he hf hg hh hi hj hk">Part 1: Examples</h1><h2 id="39f8" class="hl ha ds ba az hb hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw">The Camerata</h2><p id="df9e" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk hx gm hy go hz gq ia gs ib gu dk">The Florentine Camerata were a group of people who met in Florence in the 16th century. They had a huge impact on history and on each other.</p><p id="4c21" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">(Caveat: I’m not a student of music or music history. I listened to <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Arts-Entertainment/How-to-Listen-to-and-Understand-Great-Music-3rd-Edition-Audiobook/B00DDVQIM2" class="fc cf gv gw gx gy" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this Great Course</a> and heard about this Camerata and noticed a resemblance to some teams I’ve seen and been in. So I looked it up further, and came upon <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/i346280" class="fc cf gv gw gx gy" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Collective “Problem-Solving” in the History of Music: the Case of the Camerata</a> by Dr. Ruth Katz in the<em class="ic"> Journal of the History of Ideas</em>, and toward the end of it my mind was blown. More on that later.)</p><p id="73a5" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">Camerata literally means a small orchestra or choir. This Camerata was a diverse group of people who gathered and worked on a common problem: they were bored with polyphony, the esteemed music of their day. (<a href="https://youtu.be/C4f6cYT5y9Y?t=41" class="fc cf gv gw gx gy" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sample: Palestrina</a>) Polyphony is very pretty: it has around four melodies, each of equal importance. Each has a logic of its own, rather than melody and accompaniment. Polyphony is intellectually rewarding, but you need technical understanding to appreciate it fully. What feeling it conveys comes through auditory qualities.</p><p id="be9b" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">The Camerata asked the revolutionary question: <strong class="gj id">what if you could understand the words?</strong></p><h2 id="6e6b" class="hl ha ds ba az hb hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw">Methods</h2><p id="a072" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk hx gm hy go hz gq ia gs ib gu dk">The Camerata included (all quotes in this style are from <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709230?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" class="fc cf gv gw gx gy" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Katz</a>)</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="ae36" class="gh gi ds ic gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">musicians, artists, poets, astrologers, philosophers, scientists<br>who met informally under the aegis of Bardi and Corsi.</p></blockquote><p id="867c" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">People with diverse skills and perspectives worked together.

And experimented. The beginning of the scientific method is a big part of the Renaissance, and it intertwines with art. We have a new way of thinking, ways of asking the universe questions. Vincenzo Galilei varied lengths and tensions of strings and found the ratios that make chords.</p><p id="871c" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">The Camerata didn’t always get along. There was rivalry between Bardi and Corsi, the two chief sponsors. Bardi preferred talking, Corsi wanted to play more music. These feed each other. There was disagreement over style between Caccini and Peri, the two musical stars. Peri wanted to focus on the words, with a bit of music; Caccini wanted the singing to stand out, while also understanding the words. These tensions lead to a balance.</p><p id="c2a7" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">They did code review!</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="2eb8" class="gh gi ds ic gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">presentations made… were commented on formally by “defenders” and “censors” who were nominated for the occasion.</p></blockquote><p id="eed8" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">I like that criticism came from people designated to the role, not the asshole who doesn’t like you and takes it out on your code. (Technically, this took place in the Alterati, another meetup with a lot of the same people.)</p><h2 id="028c" class="hl ha ds ba az hb hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw">Outcomes</h2><p id="cd38" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk hx gm hy go hz gq ia gs ib gu dk">Over the years, this team changed history. They invented the music-drama, and a style of music that conveyed more meaning. (Sample: <a href="https://youtu.be/sKD1qUVJJBU?t=899" class="fc cf gv gw gx gy" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monteverdi</a>, a first composer to adopt the Camerata’s style. If you know Italian, you can probably understand the words.)</p><p id="e3ef" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">What about the individuals? Their outcomes were exceptional too! Here are some of their publications:</p><figure class="ii ij ik il im in db dc paragraph-image"><p id="84cc" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">As composers of operas and authors of scientific treatises, these half-dozen people are fewer than half of the Camerata members who have Wikipedia articles. Really, what are the chances, if you’re alive in the sixteenth century, that you have a Wikipedia article today? These people did pretty well for themselves. They grew out of the Camerata.</p><h2 id="65aa" class="hl ha ds ba az hb hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw">Also in Science</h2><p id="be8b" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk hx gm hy go hz gq ia gs ib gu dk">This pattern of a group of people coming together to solve a problem is not unique to music — it’s the common case.</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="c49a" class="gh gi ds ic gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">the Camerata resembles the kind of “invisible college” which is the key to creativity in science.</p></blockquote><p id="cf5b" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">This “invisible college” is an association of people who share ideas. Who build a new reality together, then spread it to advance the wider culture.</p><p id="5224" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">We like to give the Nobel Prize to one or two people. But who worked in their lab? Who did they correspond with?</p><p id="ceaa" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">When Jon Von Neumann went to Los Alamos for the Manhattan Project, so did two or three mathematicians that he went to high school with. Really, you grow up in Hungary, what are your chances of getting to Los Alamos? They built each other up.</p><p id="4ff4" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">These invisible colleges share:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="f3a2" class="gh gi ds ic gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">tacit understandings concerning appropriate methods of research</p></blockquote><p id="e142" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">(processes and values)</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="c03c" class="gh gi ds ic gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">priority problems</p></blockquote><p id="0c72" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">(this means they fight over who was first; more on this later)</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="3fab" class="gh gi ds ic gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">and the shorthand communication which shared work implies.</p></blockquote><p id="bfcf" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">We can move quickly together because we share common ground, compatible mental models. This is super fun, when I get to this point with my team.</p><h2 id="696e" class="hl ha ds ba az hb hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw">Also in Art</h2><p id="5cb7" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk hx gm hy go hz gq ia gs ib gu dk">People work together to develop their individual styles.

This group gave us Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, DevOps. Many of these people worked at ThoughtWorks.

I keep meeting conference speakers who were part of this group.</p><figure class="ii ij ik il im in db dc paragraph-image"><p id="9b0f" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">Another example: the early Spring team, around the same time. They came together online, from all around the world, to solve the problem of: do we really have to use J2EE? and made Java development less painful for everyone. Today, Java development is (approximately) everywhere, and Spring is everywhere Java is.</p><p id="f025" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">That group of developers and businesspeople produced an inordinate number of founders and CEOs and partners.</p><figure class="ii ij ik il im in db dc paragraph-image"><figcaption class="be ew jm jn jo dd db dc jp jq az ev">Rod Johnson, CEO Atomist; Christian Dupuis VP Eng, Atomist; Steven Schuurman, Founding CEO, Elastic; Neelan Choksi, President and COO, Tasktop; Rob Harrop, CEO, Skipjaq; Adrian Colyer, Venture Partner, Accel</figcaption></figure><p id="6d26" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">Personally, I’ve been part of three teams that grew me as a developer and as a person. The tech meetup scene in St Louis is a source of growth too. We have several groups of about twenty, and a lot of overlap so we can talk to the same people multiple times a month about interesting things.</p><p id="45ed" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">In all of these examples, we can observe a phenomenon:</p><blockquote class="ju"><p class="dt b ke kf be">Great Teams Make Great People.</p></blockquote><p id="17c8" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk kg gm kh go ki gq kj gs kk gu dk">You don’t hire star developers, put them together, and poof get a great team.

Why do great teams make great people?</p><p id="5adf" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">I have a theoretical framework to explain this.</p><p id="a981" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">It starts with Gregory Bateson. His father, William Bateson, invented the term <em class="ic">genetics</em> and pulled Mendel’s work out of obscurity (with the help of a team of people: his wife and other women, since proper biologists at the time scoffed at this work). Gregory Bateson had a camerata: the Macy Cybernetics Conferences, a series of ten conferences over several years sponsored by the Macy Foundation to advance medical research. Gregory Bateson was a pioneer of cybernetics, now known as Systems Thinking.</p><figure class="ii ij ik il im in db dc paragraph-image"><p id="fa0f" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">Systems thinking is to the present era what the scientific method was for the Renaissance.

In the 1950s-1970s, scientists put tons of numbers into computers and attempted to model entire ecosystems. Catalogue all the parts, and all the interrelationships between the parts, and we can understand the system and predict outcomes, right?</p><p id="c6c1" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">Not so. And it isn’t for lack of numbers, and details, either. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Arcs-Larger-Circles-Patterns/dp/1909470961/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523839959&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=small+arcs+of+larger+circles+by+nora+bateson" class="fc cf gv gw gx gy" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nora Bateson</a> points out that there’s more to a living system than parts and interrelations: the parts aren’t constant. We grow and learn within the system, so that the parts don’t stay the same and the interrelationships don’t stay the same. She gave a word to this, something deeper than any mechanical or model-able system, a learning system composed of learning parts: <a href="https://norabateson.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/symmathesy-a-word-in-progress/" class="fc cf gv gw gx gy" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">symmathesy</a> (sim-MATH-uh-see).</p><p id="e014" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">When we look at a living system (a team, say, or a camerata), we can see the parts.

The green and blue developers have been assigned to help, but they can’t change the system because they don’t understand it. Meanwhile, you may be changing the system fast enough that it’s impossible for them to get a grasp on it, no matter how smart they are. (I’ve been in their situation.) The solution is to work <em class="ic">together</em> on the system, and invest attention in transferring your mental model.

They used to be tradesmen: they had guilds and apprenticeships. Painters learned how to paint, and musicians how to play the instrument. This guaranteed competence; if you hired someone to paint a scene, they could paint something reasonable. It didn’t guarantee talent; guild membership was more about whose kid you were.</p><p id="5b75" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">During the Renaissance these guilds lost power. Competence was harder to guarantee, but individual talent was recognized. Painters and poets specialized in subject matter. People noticed that there was some common factor to music, painting, poetry, drama — some indefinable essence that was more than competency with a brush.</p><p id="f3e0" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">Some spark. some Art!</p><p id="4afe" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">Before, as tradesmen, painters hung out with painters, sculptors with bronzeworkers etc. After Art became a thing, artists studied in academies, and they talked to intellectuals of many kinds.</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="bdf5" class="gh gi ds ic gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">transformation of homogeneous artistic circles into “cultured” circles: poets, artists, amateurs, and laymen alike.</p></blockquote><p id="80f8" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu dk">It reminds me of a move from typing Java in a cubicle into an agile team, with discussions including designers and testers and businesspeople.

Competence is not supreme in a shifting, complex system. Our users’ needs change, our technologies change, and every change we undertake is one we’ve never made before.

To do this it must keep running, it must work on their devices, it must keep changing. Software has a greater power to change people by changing the world, but these systems are more than one person can make, and they never complete.</p><blockquote class="ju"><p class="dt b ke kf be">Serious software development is the practice of symmathesy.</p></blockquote><p id="36ed" class="gh gi ds ba gj b gk kg gm kh go ki gq kj gs kk gu dk">Software is not Art.
