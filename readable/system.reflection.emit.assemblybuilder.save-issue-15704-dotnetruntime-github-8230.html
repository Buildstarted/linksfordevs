<p>I have spent a lot of time with System.Reflection in the past few months, and noticed its various limitations or bugs. There are sometimes situations where you'd rather just see plain, uninterpreted metadata instead of the semi-high-level view that Reflection provides‚Äîwhich is neither original metadata, nor as high-level as e.g. C#, but something of its own sitting somewhere in-between.</p>
<p>I have also discovered System.Reflection.Metadata (SRM). I have been thinking about how nice it would be if the (Core)CLR had the necessary runtime hooks and extension points so that both Reflection and Reflection.Emit could be rebuilt <em>on top of</em> SRM, outside of mscorlib / System.Private.CoreLib. (At the same time, this would also enable folks to build their own custom reflection / dynamic code emission libraries.) Two things appear to be missing as of today to make this possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Neither the CLR nor the CoreCLR runtimes allow user code to get at the metadata stream &amp; IL of loaded assemblies/modules, so it could be inspected using e.g. SRM. (This assumes that the metadata as per ECMA-335 is still available unaltered after a module has been loaded by the CLR, which likely isn't the case.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither the CLR nor the CoreCLR runtime allows altering/updating an assembly that's been loaded via <code>Assembly.Load(byte[])</code> (which is what you can use today to load an assembly generated with SRM). Perhaps if EnC was exposed in some way, updating a loaded assembly would become possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I realise that having such runtime hooks closely allied with System.Reflection.Metadata is probably a pipe dream at this stage. But it might allow some super-interesting scenarios. So I'm trying to learn how this part of the runtime works to better gauge how big of a project this would be.</p>
<p>If there are any plans or efforts in this direction, I'd love to learn about it &amp; be directed to the appropriate places. Otherwise... I don't intend to hijack this issue, which is just about <code>AssemblyBuilder.Save</code>. <g-emoji alias="wink" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png">üòâ</g-emoji></p>
