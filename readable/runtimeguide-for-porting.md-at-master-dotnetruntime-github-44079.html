<p>This document is broken up into 2 major sections.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The various porting stages of porting the .NET Runtime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A technical discussion of the major components affected by a port to a new
architecture</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Porting the .NET Runtime to a new architecture typically follows along the
following path.</p>
<p>As engineering continues along the development path, it is best if the logic can
be placed into the master repository of the runtime as soon as possible. This
will have 2 major effects.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Individual commits are easier to review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all approaches for fixing problems will always be considered acceptable.
It is plausible that a change may not ever be acceptable to take into
the upstream git repo, and discovering such issues early can avoid large
amounts of sunk cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When some change is made which breaks other platforms, it will be relatively
simple to identify the break. If changes are held until after all changes
are complete and the product is fully functional, this work is likely to be
much more difficult.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Stage 1 Initial Bring Up</h2>
<p>Porting .NET to a new platform starts with porting CoreCLR to a new
architecture.</p>
<p>The process follows the following strategy</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add a new target architecture to the build environment, and make it build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine if there is sufficient incentive to bring up the interpreter, or
if simply making the jit handle the new architecture is cheaper. The
interpreter in the CLR is currently only used for bring up scenarios, and is
not maintained as generally working. It is expected that the interpreter
will take 1-2 months to enable for an engineer familiar with the CoreCLR
codebase. A functional interpreter allows the porting team to have a set of
engineers which focus exclusively on the JIT and a set which focusses on the
VM portion of the runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build up a set of scripts that will run the coreclr tests. The normal
routine for running coreclr tests is XUnit, which is only suitable once the
framework is mostly functional. These scripts will evolve during the
development effort to support ever increasing needs of development. This set
of scripts will be expected to do the following tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Run a subset of the tests. Tests are arranged in a directory structure
by category, so this subsetting mechanism will only need to be a
directory structure system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some set of tests will need to be excluded on a test by test basis. Once
the product is ready to ship, most of these disabled tests will need to
have been re-enabled, but there are tests which will be disabled for
months/years as the product is brought up to quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produce crash or core dumps. The failure mode of many tests during this
phase will be a crash. A test running tool that captures core dumps will
make these issues easier to diagnose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produce bucketized lists of failures. Generally the approach is to group
by assertion, and if there is a crash, group by callstack of crash.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first test category to focus on is the JIT category, to bring up the
general ability to run .NET code. Most of these tests are very simple, but
getting some code to work is a prerequisite for handling more complex
scenarios. When doing initial bringup, configuring the Gen0 budget of the GC
to be a large number so that the GC does not attempt to run during most
tests is very useful. (Set <code>COMPlus_GCgen0size=99999999</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once basic code is executing, the focus shifts to enabling the GC to work.
In this initial phase, the correct choice is to enable conservative GC
tracking via the <code>FEATURE_CONSERVATIVE_GC</code> macro. This feature will make
garbage collection largely function correctly, but it is not suitable for
production use of .NET, and can under certain circumstances trigger
unbounded memory use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once basic GC works, and basic JIT functionality is present, work can fan
out into all of the various features of the runtime. Of particular interest
to engineers porting the runtime are the EH, stackwalking, and interop
portions of the test suite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During this phase, porting the SOS plugin from the
<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics">https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics</a> will be very useful. The various
commands available via that tool such as dumpmt, dumpdomain and such are
regularly useful to developers attempting to port the runtime.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stage 2 Expand scenario coverage</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once the coreclr tests are largely passing, the next step is to enable
XUnit. At this time the clr is probably mostly capable of running XUnit
tests, and adding testing using the libraries tests will require XUnit to
work well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once XUnit is functional, bring up the libraries set of tests. There
is quite a lot of the CoreCLR codebase that is largely only tested by the
libraries test suites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engineers should also begin to attempt real scenario tests at this point,
such as ASP.NET Core applications. If the libraries test suites work, then
ASP.NET Core should as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stage 3 Focus on performance</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Throughput performance at this time is likely to be not that great. There
are three major opportunities to improve performance at this stage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Replace conservative GC with precise GC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tune the assembly stubs to be high performance on the platform,
and implement optional assembly stubs where hand-written assembly would
be faster than the equivalent C++ code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the code generated by the JIT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up until this point, engineers have probably been using the JIT for all code
instead of bringing the Ready To Run compiler (crossgen/crossgen2) into
usage on the platform. Implementing the ahead of the time compiler starts to
be useful at this time to improve startup performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stage 4 Focus on stress</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stress testing the system is necessary to provide confidence that the system
really works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See the various test passes done in CI, but most critically GCStress testing
is needed. See documentation around use of the ComPlus_GCStress environment
variable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stage 5 productization</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Productization is about making the runtime able to run shipped effectively
on a platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This document does not attempt to list out the work here as it is largely
specific to the platform in use and the opinions of numerous stakeholders.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These large architecture specific design issues will have substantial impact on
both the JIT and VM.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Calling convention rules â€“ Caller pop vs Callee pop, HFA arguments,
structure argument passing rules, etc. CoreCLR is designed to utilize a
broadly similar ABI to the OS api. Managed to managed calls typically have a
small set of tweaks or extensions to the ABI for VM efficiency purposes, but it
is generally intended that the ABI of managed code and the ABI of native
code are very similar. (This is not a hard requirement, and on Windows X86
the runtime supports a managed to managed abi as well as 3 separate native
abis for interop, but this scheme is generally not recommended.) See the
<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/design/coreclr/botr/clr-abi.md">CLR-ABI</a> document for how the existing architectures work.
Ensure that the CLR-ABI document is updated with all the requisite details
and special cases of the new platform. When defining the behavior of a new
processor architecture abi for CoreCLR, we must maintain that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <code>this</code> pointer is always passed in the same register regardless of
other parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various stub types will require an extra "secret" parameter. Perf
details typically drive exactly where these are placed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When executing managed code it must be possible to hijack the return
address. Current implementations require that the return address always
be on the stack to do so, although this is a known performance
deficiency for RISC platforms on arm64.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architecture specific relocation information (to represent generation of
relocations for use by load, store, jmp and call instructions) See
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#coff-relocations-object-only" rel="nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#coff-relocations-object-only</a>
for the sort of details that need to be defined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behavior and accessibility of processor single step features from within a
process. On Unix the CLR debugger uses an in process thread to single step
through functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unwind information. CoreCLR uses Windows style unwind data internally, even
on Unix platforms. A Windows style unwind structure must be defined. In
addition, it is possible to enable generation of DWARF data for exposure
through the GDB JIT
<a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/JIT-Interface.html" rel="nofollow">https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/JIT-Interface.html</a> . This
support is conditional on an #ifdef, but has been used in the past to
support bring up of new platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EH Funclets. .NET requires a 2 pass exception model in order to properly
support exception filters. This substantially differs from the typical
Itanium ABI model which is used on most Linux architectures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OS behavior with Signals. Especially exactly where the reported instruction
pointer is located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Little vs big endian. While .NET runtimes have been ported to big endian in
the past (notable examples include Mono support various game consoles, and
POWER, and XNA support on Xbox360) there are no current ports of CoreCLR to
a big endian platform.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This a list of the notable architecture specific components of the .NET runtime.
The list is not complete, but covers most of the areas where work will need to
be done.</p>
<p>Notable components</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The JIT. The jit maintains the largest concentration of architecture
specific logic in the stack. This is not surprising. See <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/design/coreclr/botr/porting-ryujit.md">Porting RyuJit</a>
for guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CLR PAL. When porting to a non-Windows OS, the PAL will be the first component
that needs to be ported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CLR VM. The VM is a mix of completely architecture neutral logic, and
very machine specific paths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unwinder. The unwinder is used to unwind stacks on non-Windows platforms.
It is located in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/master/src/coreclr/src/unwinder">https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/master/src/coreclr/src/unwinder</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System.Private.CoreLib/System.Reflection. There is little to no architecture
specific work here that is necessary for bringup. Nice-to-have work involves
adding support for the architecture in the
System.Reflection.ImageFileMachine enum, and the ProcessorArchitecture enum,
and logic that manipulates it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PE File format changes to add a new architecture. Also, the C# compiler likely
also needs a new switch to generate machine specific code for the new
architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crossgen/Crossgen2 - As the AOT compilers that produce machine specific logic
from general purpose MSIL, these will be needed to improve startup performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R2RDump - This allows diagnosing issues in pre-compiled code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>coredistools - Necessary for GCStress (if determining instruction boundaries is
non-trivial), as well as for SuperPMI asm diffs for JIT development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>debug and diagnostics components - The managed debugger and profiler are beyond
the scope of this document.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>CLR PAL</h2>
<p>The PAL provides a similar to Win32 api as the CLR codebase was originally designed
to run on Windows platforms. Mostly the PAL is concerned with OS independence, but
there are also architecture specific components.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>pal.h - Contains architecture specific details for handling unwinding scenarios
such as <code>CONTEXT</code> / <code>_KNONVOLATILE_CONTEXT_POINTERS</code>/ <code>_RUNTIME_FUNCTION</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unwinding support in <code>seh-unwind.cpp</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>context.cpp - Which manipulates and captures register contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>jitsupport.cpp - Depending on how the features of the CPU are exposed, there
may need to be code to call OS apis to gather information about CPU features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pal arch directory - <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/master/src/coreclr/src/pal/src/arch">https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/master/src/coreclr/src/pal/src/arch</a>
This directory primarily contains assembly stubs for architecture specific
handling of signals and exceptions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the PAL source code, there is a comprehensive set of PAL tests located
in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/master/src/coreclr/src/pal/tests">https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/master/src/coreclr/src/pal/tests</a>.</p>
<h2>CLR VM</h2>
<p>The VM support for architecture specific logic is encoded in a variety of
different ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Entirely architecture specific components. These are held in an architecture
specific folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Features which are only enabled on certain architectures. E.g. <code>FEATURE_HFA</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ad-hoc #if blocks used for specific architectures. As needed these are
added. The general goal is to keep these to a minimum, but difficulty here
is primarily driven by what special behavior the processor architecture
requires.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My recommendation would be to look at how Arm64 is implemented in the VM for the
most up to date model of how to implement a CPU architecture.</p>
<h3>Architecture Specific Components</h3>
<p>There are a variety of architecture specific components that all architectures
must implement.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Assembly Stubs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>cgencpu.h</code> (CPU specific header defining stubs and miscellaneous other CPU
specific details.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VSD call stub generation (virtualcallstubcpu.hpp and associated logic)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Precode/Prestub/Jumpstub generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>callingconventions.h</code>/<code>argdestination.h</code> Provides an implementation of the ABI used by VM
components. The implementation made architecture specific via a long series of
C preprocessor macros.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>gcinfodecoder.h</code> The GC info format is archictecture specific as it holds
information about which specific registers hold GC data. The implementation
is generally simplified to be defined in terms of register numbers, but if
the architecture has more registers available for use than existing architectures
then the format will need extension.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Assembly Stubs</h4>
<p>There are many reasons for which the runtime requires various assembly stubs.
Here is an annotated list of the stubs implemented for Unix on Arm64.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Only Performance. Some stubs have alternative implementations in C++ code
which are used if there isn't an assembly stub. As compilers have gotten
better, it has become more reasonable to just use the C++ versions. Often
the biggest performance cost/win is due to fast paths being written that do
not require setting up a stack frame. Most of the casting helpers fall in
this category.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>JIT_Stelem_Ref</code> â€“ very slightly faster version of
<code>JIT_Stelem_Ref_Portable</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>General purpose correctness. Some helpers adjust the abi of whatever they
call in interesting ways, manipulate/parse the "secret" arguments, or do
other not quite compilable to standardized C concepts.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>CallDescrWorkerInternal</code> â€“ Needed to support VM to managed function
calls. Necessary for all applications as this is how the main method is
called.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>LazyMachStateCaptureState</code>/<code>HelperMethodFrameRestoreState</code> â€“ Needed to
support a GC occurring with an FCALL or HCALL on the stack. (Incorrect
implementations will cause unpredictable crashes during or after garbage
collection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>NDirectImportThunk</code> â€“ Needed to support saving off a set of arguments to
a p/invoke so that the runtime can find the actual target. Also uses one
of the secret arguments (Used by all p/invoke methods)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>PrecodeFixupThunk</code> â€“ Needed to convert the secret argument from a
FixupPrecode* to a MethodDesc*. This function exists to reduce the
code size of FixupPrecodes as there are (Used by many managed methods)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ThePreStub</code> - Needed to support saving off a set of arguments to the
stack so that the runtime can find or jit the right target method.
(Needed for any jitted method to execute Used by all managed methods)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ThePreStubPatch</code> â€“ Exists to provide a reliable spot for the managed
debugger to put a breakpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GC Write Barriers â€“ These are used to provide the GC with information
about what memory is being updated. The existing implementations of
these are all complex, and there are a number of controls where the
runtime can adjust to tweak the behavior of the barrier in various ways.
Some of these adjustments involve modifying the code to inject
constants, or even wholesale replacements of various bits and pieces. To
achieve high performance, all of these features must work; however, to
achieve bringup supporting a simple GC, focus on the case of the single
heap workstation GC. Additionally, the
FEATURE_MANUALLY_MANAGED_CARD_BUNDLES and
FEATURE_USE_SOFTWARE_WRITE_WATCH_FOR_GC_HEAP can be implemented as
performance needs require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ComCallPreStub</code>/ <code>COMToCLRDispatchHelper</code> /<code>GenericComCallStub</code> - not
necessary for non-Windows platforms at this time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>TheUMEntryPrestub</code>/ <code>UMThunkStub</code> - used to enter the runtime from
non-managed code through entrypoints generated from the
Marshal.GetFunctionPointerForDelagate api.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>OnHijackTripThread</code> - needed for thread suspension to support GC + other
suspension requiring events. This is typically not needed for very early
stage bringup of the product, but will be needed for any decent size
application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CallEHFunclet</code> â€“ Used to call catch, finally and fault funclets. Behavior
is specific to exactly how funclets are implemented. Only used if
USE_FUNCLET_CALL_HELPER is set</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CallEHFilterFunclet</code> â€“ Used to call filter funclets. Behavior is specific
to exactly how funclets are implemented. Only used if
USE_FUNCLET_CALL_HELPER is set</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ResolveWorkerChainLookupAsmStub</code>/ <code>ResolveWorkerAsmStub</code> Used for virtual
stub dispatch (virtual call support for interface, and some virtual
methods). These work in tandem with the logic in virtualcallstubcpu.h to
implement the logic described in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/design/coreclr/botr/virtual-stub-dispatch.md">Virtual Stub Dispatch</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ProfileEnter</code>/ <code>ProfileeLeave</code>/ <code>ProfileTailcall</code> â€“ Used to call function
entry/exit profile functions acquired through the ICorProfiler
interface. Used in VERY rare circumstances. It is reasonable to wait to
implement these until the final stages of productization. Most profilers
do not use this functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>JIT_PInvokeBegin</code>/<code>JIT_PInvokeEnd</code> â€“ Leave/enter the managed runtime state. Necessary
for ReadyToRun pre-compiled pinvoke calls, so that they do not cause GC
starvation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>VarargPInvokeStub</code>/ <code>GenericPInvokeCalliHelper</code> Used to support calli
pinvokes. It is expected that C# 8.0 will increase use of this feature.
Today use of this feature on Unix requires hand-written IL. On Windows
this feature is commonly used by C++/CLI</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>EH Correctness. Some helpers are written in assembly to provide well known
locations for NullReferenceExceptions to be generated out of a SIGSEGV
signal.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>JIT_MemSet</code>, and <code>JIT_MemCpy</code> have this requirement</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>cgencpu.h</h4>
<p>This header is included by various code in the VM directory. It provides a large
set of functionality that is architecture specific, including but not limited to</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Defines that are architecture specific specifying the sizes of various data
structures the VM should create, and such</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defines which specify which of various jit helpers should be replaced with
asm functions instead of the portable C++ implementations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CalleeSavedRegisters, ArgumentRegisters, and FloatArgumentRegisters as
needed to describe the calling convention for the platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ClrFlushInstructionCache function. If the architecture doesn't actually
need to manually flush the icache, then this function is empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various functions for decoding and manipulating jump instructions. These are
used by various stub routines to predict where code will go, and to produce
simple jump stubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The StubLinkerCpu class for the architecture. Each Architecture defines its
own StubLinkerCpu api surface and uses it to produce VM generated code.
There is a small set of apis that are called from general purpose vm code
(EmitComputedInstantiatingMethodStub, EmitShuffleThunkshared) across
multiple architectures, and then there are the individual assembly
instruction emission functions which are architecture specific. The
StubLinker is used to generate complex stubs, where the set of assembly
instructions emitted varies from stub to stub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various stub data structures. Many very simple stubs are not emitted via an
emission of a stream of bytes, but instead are exceptionally regular, and
are effectively the same instructions for each different stub, only with
slightly different data members. Instead of using the StubLinker mechanism,
the VM instead has structures that represent the entirety of the stub and
its associate data, and fill in the assembly instructions and data fields
with a normal constructor call setting magic numbers. In addition to being
executable, these stubs are often parsed to determine exactly what a given
function is, what it is doing, where control flow will lead to, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>virtualcallstubcpu.h</h4>
<p>This header is used to provide implementation of various stubs as used by
virtual stub dispatch. These stubs are the lookup, resolver, and dispatch stubs
as described in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/design/coreclr/botr/virtual-stub-dispatch.md">Virtual Stub Dispatch</a>. These are
maintained in a separate file from the rest of cgencpu.h for historical reasons,
and for reasons of size (there is quite a lot of logic here.)</p>
<h2>System.Private.CoreLib</h2>
<h3>Initial Bring up</h3>
<p>In System.Private.CoreLib there is no work necessary for initial bring up.</p>
<h3>Complete support</h3>
<p>Complete support involves changing the publicly visible api surface of the
product. Doing so is a process handled via public issues on GitHub and
discussions with the api review board.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding support for the architecture to the
System.Reflection.ImageFileMachine enum, and
System.Reflection.ProcessorArchitecture enum as well as related logic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding support for architecture specific intrinsics such as SIMD
instructions, or other non-standard api surface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
