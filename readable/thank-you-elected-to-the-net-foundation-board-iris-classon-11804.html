<p>This was a big surprise! When I ran as a candidate I didnâ€™t expect to actually get elected, but I wanted to lead by example and encourage others to become voting members and to run as candidates. Yesterday I woke up to a lovely email congratulating me on the board seat- and I was (am) ecstatic!</p>
<p>Thank you if you voted, and thank you if you voted for me. Iâ€™ll do my very best to do a good job, and I canâ€™t wait to see how we can serve the community.</p>
<p>Here is a personal thank you video, pardon my casual wear LOL. I was in mum-mode, and itâ€™s weekend ðŸ˜€</p>

<p>If this is the first time you are hearing about the .NET Foundation here is a little summary:</p>
<p>The foundation is an independent organization that supports the .NET community and opensource with the aim to broaden and strengthen the .NET ecosystem and community. This is done in a variety of ways, with project guidance, mentoring, legal and marketing help, technical and financial support setup (not direct financial help) and more. <a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/">Visit the website </a>to read more about the foundation, and why not check out the blog?</p>
