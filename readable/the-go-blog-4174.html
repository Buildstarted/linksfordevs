  <h4 id="TOC_1.">Introduction</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    In 2019, we launched <a href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank">go.dev</a>, a new hub for Go


    developers.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    As part of the site, we also launched <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a>, a


    central source of information about Go packages and modules. Like


    <a href="https://godoc.org/" target="_blank">godoc.org</a>, pkg.go.dev serves Go


    documentation. However, it also understands modules and has information about


    past versions of a package!
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Throughout this year, we will be adding features to


    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a> to help our users better understand their


    dependencies and help them make better decisions around what libraries to


    import.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_2.">Redirecting godoc.org requests to pkg.go.dev</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    To minimize confusion about which site to use, later this year we are planning


    to redirect traffic from <a href="https://godoc.org/" target="_blank">godoc.org</a> to the corresponding


    page on <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a>. We need your help to ensure that


    pkg.go.dev addresses all of our users' needs. We encourage everyone to begin


    using pkg.go.dev today for all of their needs and provide feedback.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Your feedback will inform our transition plan, with the goal of making


    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a> our primary source of information and


    documentation for packages and modules. We’re sure there are things that you


    want to see on pkg.go.dev, and we want to hear from you


    about what those features are!
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    You can share your feedback with us on these channels:
  </p>
  

  <ul>
  
    <li>Post on the <a href="https://golang.org/s/discovery-feedback" target="_blank">Go issue tracker</a>.</li>
  
    <li>Email <a href="mailto:go-discovery-feedback@google.com" target="_blank">go-discovery-feedback@google.com</a>.</li>
  
    <li>Click “Share Feedback” or “Report an Issue” in the go.dev footer.</li>
  
  </ul>

  
  <p>
    As part of this transition, we will also be discussing plans for API access to


    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a>. We will be posting updates on


    <a href="https://golang.org/s/discovery-updates" target="_blank">Go issue 33654</a>.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_3.">Frequently asked questions</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    Since our launch in November, we’ve received tons of great feedback about


    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a> from Go users. For the remainder of this post, we thought it would


    be helpful to answer some frequently asked questions.
  </p>
  

  <h4 id="TOC_3.1.">My package doesn’t show up on pkg.go.dev! How do I add it?</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    We monitor the <a href="https://index.golang.org/index" target="_blank">Go Module Index</a> regularly for


    new packages to add to <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a>. If you don’t see a


    package on pkg.go.dev, you can add it by fetching the module version from


    <a href="https://proxy.golang.org/" target="_blank">proxy.golang.org</a>. See


    <a href="https://go.dev/about" target="_blank">go.dev/about</a> for instructions.
  </p>
  


  <h4 id="TOC_3.2.">My package has license restrictions. What’s wrong with it?</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    We understand it can be a frustrating experience to not be able to see the


    package you want in its entirety on <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a>. We


    appreciate your patience as we improve our license detection algorithm.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Since our launch in November, we've made the following improvements:
  </p>
  

  <ul>
  
    <li>Updated our <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/license-policy" target="_blank">license policy</a> to include the list of licenses that we detect and recognize</li>
  
    <li>Worked with the <a href="https://github.com/google/licensecheck" target="_blank">licensecheck</a> team to improve detection for copyright notices</li>
  
    <li>Established a manual review process for special cases</li>
  
  </ul>

  
  <p>
    As always, our license policy is at


    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/license-policy" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev/license-policy</a>. If you are


    having issues, feel free to <a href="https://golang.org/s/discovery-feedback" target="_blank">file an issue on the Go issue tracker</a>, or email


    <a href="mailto:go-discovery-feedback@google.com" target="_blank">go-discovery-feedback@google.com</a>


    so that we can work with you directly!
  </p>
  


  <h4 id="TOC_3.3.">Will pkg.go.dev be open-sourced so I can run it at work for my private code?</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    We understand that corporations with private code want to run a documentation


    server that provides module support. We want to help meet that need, but we


    feel we don’t yet understand it as well as we need to.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    We’ve heard from users that running the <a href="https://godoc.org/" target="_blank">godoc.org</a> server


    is more complex than it should be, because it is designed for serving at public


    internet scale instead of just within a company. We believe the current


    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a> server would have the same problem.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    We think a new server is more likely to be the right answer for use with


    private code, instead of exposing every company to the complexity of running


    the internet-scale <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a> codebase. In addition to


    serving documentation, a new server could also serve information to


    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports?tab=doc" target="_blank">goimports</a> and


    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls" target="_blank">gopls</a>.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    If you want to run such a server, please fill out this


    <a href="https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6FHmaLveae6d8Bn" target="_blank"><b>3-5 minute survey</b></a>


    to help us better understand your needs. This survey will be available until


    March 1st, 2020.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    We’re excited about the future of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a> in 2020,


    and we hope you are too! We look forward to hearing your feedback and working


    with the Go community on this transition.
  </p>

  <div data-slug="/go1.15-proposals">
    <h2><a href="https://blog.golang.org/go1.15-proposals">Proposals for Go 1.15</a></h2>
    <p>
    Robert Griesemer, for the Go team<br>
    28 January 2020
    </p>
    
  
  
    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_1.">Status</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    We are close to the Go 1.14 release, planned for February assuming all goes


    well, with an RC1 candidate almost ready. Per the process outlined in the


    <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go2-here-we-come" target="_blank">Go 2, here we come!</a> blog post,


    it is again the time in our development and release cycle to consider if and


    what language or library changes we might want to include for our next release,


    Go 1.15, scheduled for August of this year.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    The primary goals for Go remain package and version management, better error


    handling support, and generics. Module support is in good shape and getting


    better with each day, and we are also making progress on the generics front


    (more on that later this year). Our attempt seven months ago at providing a


    better error handling mechanism, the


    <a href="https://golang.org/issue/32437" target="_blank"><code>try</code> proposal</a>, met good support


    but also strong opposition and we decided to abandon it. In its aftermath there


    were many follow-up proposals, but none of them seemed convincing enough,


    clearly superior to the <code>try</code> proposal, or less likely to cause similar


    controversy. Thus, we have not further pursued changes to error handling


    for now. Perhaps some future insight will help us to improve upon the status


    quo.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_2.">Proposals</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    Given that modules and generics are actively being worked on, and with error


    handling changes out of the way for the time being, what other changes should


    we pursue, if any? There are some perennial favorites such as requests for


    enums and immutable types, but none of those ideas are sufficiently developed


    yet, nor are they urgent enough to warrant a lot of attention by the Go team,


    especially when also considering the cost of making a language change.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    After reviewing all potentially viable proposals, and more importantly, because


    we don’t want to incrementally add new features without a long-term plan, we


    concluded that it is better to hold off with major changes this time. Instead


    we concentrate on a couple of new <code>vet</code> checks and a minor adjustment to the


    language. We have selected the following three proposals:
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    <a href="https://golang.org/issue/32479" target="_blank">#32479</a>.


    Diagnose <code>string(int)</code> conversion in <code>go vet</code>.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    We were planning to get this done for the upcoming Go 1.14 release but we didn’t


    get around to it, so here it is again. The <code>string(int)</code> conversion was introduced


    early in Go for convenience, but it is confusing to newcomers (<code>string(10)</code> is


    <code>"\n"</code> not <code>"10"</code>) and not justified anymore now that the conversion is available


    in the <code>unicode/utf8</code> package.


    Since <a href="https://golang.org/issue/3939" target="_blank">removing this conversion</a> is


    not a backwards-compatible change, we propose to start with a <code>vet</code> error instead.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    <a href="https://golang.org/issue/4483" target="_blank">#4483</a>.


    Diagnose impossible interface-interface type assertions in <code>go vet</code>.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Currently, Go permits any type assertion <code>x.(T)</code> (and corresponding type switch case)


    where the type of <code>x</code> and <code>T</code> are interfaces. Yet, if both <code>x</code> and <code>T</code> have a method


    with the same name but different signatures it is impossible for any value assigned


    to <code>x</code> to also implement <code>T</code>; such type assertions will always fail at runtime


    (panic or evaluate to <code>false</code>). Since we know this at compile time, the compiler


    might as well report an error. Reporting a compiler error in this case is not a


    backwards-compatible change, thus we also propose to start with a <code>vet</code> error


    instead.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    <a href="https://golang.org/issue/28591" target="_blank">#28591</a>.


    Constant-evaluate index and slice expressions with constant strings and indices.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Currently, indexing or slicing a constant string with a constant index, or indices,


    produces a non-constant <code>byte</code> or <code>string</code> value, respectively. But if all operands


    are constant, the compiler can constant-evaluate such expressions and produce a


    constant (possibly untyped) result. This is a fully backward-compatible change


    and we propose to make the necessary adjustments to the spec and compilers.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    (Correction: We found out after posting that this change is not backward-compatible;


    see <a href="https://golang.org/issue/28591#issuecomment-579993684" target="_blank">comment</a> for details.)
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_3.">Timeline</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    We believe that none of these three proposals are controversial but there’s


    always a chance that we missed something important. For that reason we plan


    to have the proposals implemented at the beginning of the Go 1.15 release cycle


    (at or shortly after the Go 1.14 release) so that there is plenty of time to


    gather experience and provide feedback. Per the


    <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go2-here-we-come" target="_blank">proposal evaluation process</a>,


    the final decision will be made at the end of the development cycle, at the


    beginning of May, 2020.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_4.">And one more thing...</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    We receive many more language change proposals


    (<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/labels/LanguageChange" target="_blank">issues labeled LanguageChange</a>)


    than we can review thoroughly. For instance, just for error handling alone,


    there are 57 issues, of which five are currently still open. Since the cost


    of making a language change, no matter how small, is high and the benefits


    are often unclear, we must err on the side of caution. Consequently, most


    language change proposals get rejected sooner or later, sometimes with minimal


    feedback. This is unsatisfactory for all parties involved. If you have spent a


    lot of time and effort outlining your idea in detail, it would be nice to not


    have it immediately rejected. On the flip side, because the general


    <a href="https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">proposal process</a>


    is deliberately simple, it is very easy to create language change proposals


    that are only marginally explored, causing the review committee significant


    amounts of work. To improve this experience for everybody we are adding a new


    <a href="https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/go2-language-changes.md" target="_blank">questionnaire</a>


    for language changes: filling out that template will help reviewers evaluate


    proposals more efficiently because they don’t need to try to answer those


    questions themselves. And hopefully it will also provide better guidance for


    proposers by setting expectations right from the start. This is an experiment


    that we will refine over time as needed.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Thank you for helping us improve the Go experience!

    Since 2016, thousands of Gophers around the world have helped the Go project by sharing your thoughts via our annual Go Developer Survey. Your feedback has played an enormous role in driving changes to our language, ecosystem, and community, including <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/go/gophercon-2019-go-pls-stop-breaking-my-editor" target="_blank">the gopls language server</a>, new <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors" target="_blank">error-handling mechanics</a>, the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/module-mirror-launch" target="_blank">module mirror</a>, and so much more from the latest <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go1.13" target="_blank">Go 1.13 release</a>. And of course, we publicly share <a href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2016-results" target="_blank">each</a> <a href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2017-results" target="_blank">year's</a> <a href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2018-results" target="_blank">results</a>, so we can all benefit from the community's insights.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Today we are launching the 2019 Go Developer Survey. We'd love to hear from everyone who uses Go, used to use Go, or is interested in using Go, to help ensure the language, community, and ecosystem fit the needs of the people closest to it. Please help us shape Go's future by participating in this 15-minute survey by December 15th: <a href="https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b1xqnBCMpZAhJZ3" target="_blank">Take the 2019 Go Developer Survey</a>.

  <p>
    Over the last two years,


    as we’ve spoken with users at companies of all sizes,


    we’ve heard three questions repeatedly:


    who else is using Go,


    what do they use it for,


    and how can I find useful Go packages?
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Today we are launching <a href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank">go.dev</a>, a new hub for Go developers,


    to help answer those questions.


    There you will find a wealth of learning resources to get started with the language,


    featured use cases, and case studies of companies using Go.
  </p>
  

      
        
<p><img src="https://blog.golang.org/go.dev/home.png" width="850" alt="">
</p>

      
        
  
  <p>
    (Note that <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">golang.org</a> is still the home for the


    open source Go project and the Go distribution.


    Go.dev is a companion site to provide these supporting resources.)
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Clicking on Explore brings you to <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a>,


    a central source of information about Go packages and modules.


    Like <a href="https://godoc.org/" target="_blank">godoc.org</a>, pkg.go.dev serves Go documentation.


    However, it also understands modules and has information


    about all versions of a package, including


    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/std?tab=versions" target="_blank">all releases of the standard library</a>!


    And it detects and displays licenses and has a better search algorithm.


    You can follow


    <a href="https://golang.org/issue/33654" target="_blank">Go issue 33654</a> for future developments.

</p>

      
        
  
  <p>
    Today’s launch is our minimum viable product for go.dev,


    so we can share what we’ve built to help the community and get feedback.


    We intend to expand the site over time.


    If you have any ideas, suggestions or issues,


    please let us know via the “Share Feedback” and “Report an Issue” links at the bottom of every page.

    Celebrating 10 years of Go makes me think back to early November 2009,


    when we were getting ready to share Go with the world.


    We didn’t know what kind of reaction to expect,


    whether anyone would care about this little language.


    I hoped that even if no one ended up using Go,


    we would at least have drawn attention to some good ideas,


    especially Go’s approach to concurrency and interfaces,


    that could influence follow-on languages.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Once it became clear that people were excited about Go,


    I looked at the history of popular languages


    like C, C++, Perl, Python, and Ruby,


    examining how long each took to gain widespread adoption.


    For example, Perl seemed to me to have appeared fully-formed


    in the mid-to-late 1990s, with CGI scripts and the web,


    but it was first released in 1987.


    This pattern repeated for almost every language I looked at:


    it seems to take roughly a decade of quiet, steady improvement


    and dissemination before a new language really takes off.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    I wondered: where would Go be after a decade?
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Today, we can answer that question:


    Go is everywhere, used by at least <a href="https://research.swtch.com/gophercount" target="_blank">a million developers worldwide</a>.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Go’s original target was networked system infrastructure,


    what we now call cloud software.


    Every major cloud provider today uses core cloud infrastructure written in Go,


    such as Docker, Etcd, Istio, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Terraform;


    the majority of the


    <a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/" target="_blank">Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s projects</a>


    are written in Go.


    Countless companies are using Go to move their own work to the cloud as well,


    from startups building from scratch


    to enterprises modernizing their software stack.


    Go has also found adoption well beyond its original cloud target,


    with uses ranging


    from


    controlling tiny embedded systems with


    <a href="https://gobot.io/" target="_blank">GoBot</a> and <a href="https://tinygo.org/" target="_blank">TinyGo</a>


    to detecting cancer with


    <a href="https://medium.com/grail-eng/bigslice-a-cluster-computing-system-for-go-7e03acd2419b" target="_blank">massive big data analysis and machine learning at GRAIL</a>,


    and everything in between.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    All this is to say that Go has succeeded beyond our wildest dreams.


    And Go’s success isn’t just about the language.


    It’s about the language, the ecosystem, and especially the community working together.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    In 2009, the language was a good idea with a working sketch of an implementation.


    The <code>go</code> command did not exist:


    we ran commands like <code>6g</code> to compile and <code>6l</code> to link binaries,


    automated with makefiles.


    We typed semicolons at the ends of statements.


    The entire program stopped during garbage collection,


    which then struggled to make good use of two cores.


    Go ran only on Linux and Mac, on 32- and 64-bit x86 and 32-bit ARM.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Over the last decade, with the help of Go developers all over the world,


    we have evolved this idea and sketch into a productive language


    with fantastic tooling,


    a production-quality implementation,


    a


    <a href="https://blog.golang.org/ismmkeynote" target="_blank">state-of-the-art garbage collector</a>,


    and <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install/source#introduction" target="_blank">ports to 12 operating systems and 10 architectures</a>.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Any programming language needs the support of a thriving ecosystem.


    The open source release was the seed for that ecosystem,


    but since then, many people have contributed their time and talent


    to fill the Go ecosystem with great tutorials, books, courses, blog posts,


    podcasts, tools, integrations, and of course reusable Go packages importable with <code>go</code> <code>get</code>.


    Go could never have succeeded without the support of this ecosystem.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Of course, the ecosystem needs the support of a thriving community.


    In 2019 there are dozens of Go conferences all over the world,


    along with


    <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/go" target="_blank">over 150 Go meetup groups with over 90,000 members</a>.


    <a href="https://golangbridge.org/" target="_blank">GoBridge</a>


    and


    <a href="https://medium.com/@carolynvs/www-loves-gobridge-ccb26309f667" target="_blank">Women Who Go</a>


    help bring new voices into the Go community,


    through mentoring, training, and conference scholarships.


    This year alone, they have taught


    hundreds of people from traditionally underrepresented groups


    at workshops where community members teach and mentor those new to Go.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    There are


    <a href="https://research.swtch.com/gophercount" target="_blank">over a million Go developers</a>


    worldwide,


    and companies all over the globe are looking to hire more.


    In fact, people often tell us that learning Go


    helped them get their first jobs in the tech industry.


    In the end, what we’re most proud of about Go


    is not a well-designed feature or a clever bit of code


    but the positive impact Go has had in so many people’s lives.


    We aimed to create a language that would help us be better developers,


    and we are thrilled that Go has helped so many others.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    As


    <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GoTurns10" target="_blank">#GoTurns10</a>,


    I hope everyone will take a moment to celebrate


    the Go community and all we have achieved.


    On behalf of the entire Go team at Google,


    thank you to everyone who has joined us over the past decade.


    Let’s make the next one even more incredible!
