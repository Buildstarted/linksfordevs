                <p>Everyone wants to move to the cloud – but few realize the extent of the challenges in enabling a secure and smooth migration.<br>
In today’s webinar, Cryptosense’s CEO, Graham Steel, and Unbound Tech’s VP R&amp;D, Guy Pe’er, will discuss:<br>
+ Common challenges of cloud migration – specifically, for IaaS.<br>
+ How to determine which data and processes are sensitive in the existing app – which keys are in use and how they’re stored<br>
+ What types of extra protection needs to be added prior to migration: encryption, key management and protection.<br>
+ How to securely migrate to the cloud – from key identification to encryption verification, overseeing development, and ensuring compliance.</p>

                <p>In this “fireside video chat”, Matt Green and Yehuda Lindell will discuss location tracking in the context of COVID-19 and the privacy threats involved. This topic has come to the forefront again due to the proposals in multiple countries to use widespread location tracking in order to locate people who have come in contact with someone who has contracted COVID-19. The discussion will cover whether or not such use is legitimate, what the dangers are and whether they should be accepted, and finally what technological (cryptographic) solutions could be developed in order to achieve the desired affect without compromising on privacy.</p>

                <div><p>Tampering with the code-signing process has become one of the easiest entry points for malicious activity. From the ASUS attack to Medtronic, the interconnectivity of data and the spread of data across billions of devices is increasingly putting our data, time, and money at risk. </p><p>

Join Guy Peer and Allan Konar to learn the dirty details of recent code-signing hacks to make sure your organization isn’t next!</p><p>

The challenge: implementing and deploying enterprise-grade code signing solutions that can centrally manage and protect all an organizations’ code signing private keys. <br>
This webinar will explore: </p><p>

-The challenges of applying consistent, secure code-signing practices across the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) <br>
-A comparison of alternative approaches to enterprise code-signing implementation</p></div>
