<h2>The package was produced by Amazon spokesperson Todd Walker.</h2>



<p>Amazon is taking proactive action ahead of Wednesday’s annual shareholders meeting—at which&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/25/amazon-shareholder-meeting-investors-want-worker-safety-disclosures.html">investors plan on demanding the company address worker safety issues</a>&nbsp;after at least eight warehouse employees have died of COVID-19—by pushing a package&nbsp;to local news outlets that promotes the corporation’s health and safety efforts.</p>

<p>While most TV news professionals have&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/KOCOZach/status/1264589763689971716?s=20">scoffed at the idea of running Amazon-provided content as news</a>, at least 10 stations across the country ran some form of the package on their news broadcasts. The package—you can view the script Amazon provided to news stations&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20200521005268/en/793115/1/Amazon+Safety+VNR+script.pdf?download=1">here</a>—was produced by Amazon spokesperson Todd Walker. Only one station, Toledo ABC affiliate WTVG, acknowledged that Walker was an Amazon employee, not a news reporter. WTVG and WGXA in Macon, Georgia, noted that Amazon had supplied the video. Other stations that ran the Amazon-provided content as a news package include:</p>



<ul><li>WTVJ-NBC, Miami, FL</li><li>WKRN-ABC, Nashville, TN</li><li>WLEX-NBC, Lexington, KY (ran twice)</li><li>WVVA-NBC, Bluefield, WV</li><li>WTVM-ABC, Columbus, GA (ran twice)</li><li>KMIR-NBC, Palm Springs, CA (ran three times)</li><li>WBTW-CBS, Myrtle Beach, SC</li><li>WOAY-ABC, Bluefield, WV (ran twice)</li></ul>



<p>In response to a request for comment on why the station ran the package, Wes Armstead, news director of the Bluefield NBC affiliate WVVA, told <em>COURIER</em>, “I was not aware the package was provided by Amazon.” Armstead said, “We’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again.”</p>



<p>News directors of the other stations—and Amazon—did not respond to requests for comment by publication time. We’ll update the story as soon as we get a reply.</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>According to an Amazon spokesperson, the video and script were published to Business Wire as are many other companies’ in-house produced content for media organizations. </p>



<p>Amazon also released this statement: “We welcome reporters into our buildings and it’s misleading to suggest otherwise. This type of video was created to share an inside look into the health and safety measures we’ve rolled out in our buildings and was intended for reporters who for a variety of reasons weren’t able to come tour one of our sites themselves.”</p>



<p><strong>Correction: </strong>This report previously claimed WPLG-ABC in Miami utilized content provided by Amazon; it, in fact, used a similar piece distributed by CNN. We have updated this article and the headline to reflect this change. We regret the error. </p>



<p>We also clarified that in WGXA-ABC’s coverage, the station noted Amazon provided the video.  </p>
