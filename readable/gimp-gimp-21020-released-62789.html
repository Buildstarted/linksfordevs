<p>We listened to users’ feedback on introducing tool groups in the toolbox in the previous release. A lot of people told us they appreciated the change in general but were quite averse to having to click to open the list of tools in a group. The new release adds the option to show the tool-group menu as soon as the mouse hovers over the toolbox button, without having to click it. This option is enabled by default when the toolbox is arranged in a single column, but it can be enabled for arbitrary toolbox layouts, or disabled entirely, through the <em>Toolbox</em> page of the <em>Preferences</em>&nbsp;dialog.</p>
<p>Additionally, when not using the new behavior, toolbox tooltips now list all the tools in a group, to improve their&nbsp;discoverability.</p>

</figure>


<p><span>GIMP</span> now provides a kind of a non-destructive cropping behavior by default. Instead of deleting pixels that you cropped out and thus changing both the layer and the canvas, it will simply resize the canvas. If you export such an image, the resulted file will only have what you see within canvas&nbsp;boundaries.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>The benefit of that is (at least)&nbsp;threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can revert to the original uncropped version by going to <code>Image -&gt; Fit Canvas to Layers</code>. None of your edits between cropping and uncropping will&nbsp;disappear.</li>
<li>If you save your project as an <span>XCF</span> file, you can close the file and even quit <span>GIMP</span> and still be able to remove cropping and then crop differently at any time&nbsp;later. </li>
<li>When you are on the fence about your cropping decision, you can view pixels that you cropped out by going to <code>View -&gt; Show All</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want the old “destructive” behavior back, simply tick the ‘Delete cropped pixels’ checkbox in <em>Crop</em> tool’s&nbsp;settings.</p>

<p>The <em>Vignette</em> filter now has on-canvas controls to visually manipulate the geometry of the vignette rather than enter numeric values in a&nbsp;dialog.</p>
<p>Whichever vignette shape you pick, you will always have control for the inner area that stays unchanged, the border of the vignette where pixels stop changing, and the medium point between the two. Dragging the mouse pointer anywhere outside of the outer control will result in rotating the vignette&nbsp;shape.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two new shapes,  ‘Horizontal’ and&nbsp;‘Vertical’.</p>

<p>There are three new filters all related to imitating out-of-focus&nbsp;blur.</p>
<p><em>Variable Blur</em> takes a layer or channel as an input mask to decide which pixels should be blurred (at what percentage of user-defined maximum blur intensity) and what pixels should stay unchanged, and then blurs pixels with Gaussian&nbsp;Blur.</p>

<p><em>Lens Blur</em> does the same but provides a far more realistic imitation of the out-of-focus blur, including the partial occlusion of sharp foreground objects by highlights blurred in the background. You also have control of how much highlights are&nbsp;affected.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p><em>Focus Blur</em> provides a simple user interface to out-of-focus blurring using the same on-canvas controls that the updated <em>Vignette</em> filter has. You can choose between <em>Gaussian Blur</em> and <em>Lens Blur</em> as blurring methods. One of the uses for the filter is creating miniature fakes out of regular photos — the effect originally achieved by using a tilt-shift lens that changes the plane of&nbsp;focus.</p>

<p>New <em>Bloom</em> filter applies an effect that looks a lot like what you can get with the <em>Soft Glow</em> filter but, unlike, <em>Soft Glow</em>, it doesn’t decrease saturation. Technically, <em>Bloom</em> isolates the highlights region, feathers it, and then recombines it with the original&nbsp;image.</p>

<p>The options dialog of <span>GEGL</span> filters now provides a new <em>Blending Options</em> section, which allows controlling the blending-mode and opacity with which the filter is applied.
This replaces the <em>Fade</em> functionality, which was removed in version&nbsp;2.10.10.</p>
<p>Filter previews now remain cached even when toggled off, allowing for quickly switching between the original and filtered&nbsp;views.</p>

<p>While <span>GIMP</span> could already load 16-bits-per-channel <span>PSD</span> files, high-bit-depth images can now be exported using 16-bits per channel as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>In addition, channels are now exported in the correct order, and with their original&nbsp;colors.</p>

<ul>
<li>Painting tools can now save and load opacity and blending mode to/from&nbsp;presets.</li>
<li>Canon <span>CR3</span> files are now properly recognized by <span>GIMP</span> and sent to your raw developer software of&nbsp;choice.</li>
<li>The <span>TWAIN</span> plug-in used for acquiring images via scanners has been slightly refactored and now supports 16-bit <span>RGB</span>/grayscale&nbsp;images.</li>
<li><span>PNG</span> and <span>TIFF</span> plug-ins now default to not saving color values when alpha channel is present and 0 itself. This is to address security concerns about using simple cutting to remove sensitive&nbsp;information.</li>
<li>The <span>PDF</span> plug-in now imports multi-page documents in bottom-first order, similar to animated formats, and also similar to defaults for <span>PDF</span> exporting. This brings consistency but breaks existing behavior in 3rd party&nbsp;scripts.</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual, new <span>GIMP</span> release is accompanied by new releases of <a href="http://gegl.org/babl/">babl</a> and <a href="http://gegl.org/"><span>GEGL</span></a>&nbsp;libraries.</p>
<p>The new version of babl comes mostly with bug fixes and performance improvements like the use of <span>AVX2</span> instructions to convert gamma u8 data to linear float (making those conversions between 1.25x and 2.2x faster). It also features <span>VAPI</span> file generation for Vala integration as the unstable branch of <span>GIMP</span> now supports creating new plug-ins with&nbsp;Vala.</p>
<p>The most important changes in <span>GEGL</span>&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>New meta-data <span>API</span> that permits handling non-Exif metadata in different file loaders
and savers in a generic&nbsp;manner</li>
<li>Faster and softer cubic&nbsp;interpolation.</li>
<li><span>GEGL</span> now gracefully fails when running out of swap&nbsp;space.</li>
<li>The <code>hue-chroma</code> operation has been fixed to avoid modifying hue/chroma of&nbsp;neutrals</li>
<li>The <code>dropshadow</code> operation now has an option to grow the shadow. This means, with zero shift and larger shadow, you can stroke a text or a bitmap&nbsp;layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, <span>GEGL</span> got several new operations, some of which we already described above. Others&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>border-align</code>: places a buffer within the borders of another&nbsp;one.</li>
<li><code>pack</code>: joins two buffers into one, with optional&nbsp;gap.</li>
<li><code>piecewise-blend</code>: uses a grayscale map as index into array of buffers used as <span>LUT</span> (required by new blur&nbsp;filters)</li>
<li><code>reset-origin</code>: moves upper left of extent to&nbsp;0,0</li>
<li><code>band-tune</code>: parametric band equalizer for tuning frequency bands of&nbsp;image.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also thank lillolollo, nmat, and Michael Schumacher for triaging bug reports, and Julien Hardelin for updating the user&nbsp;manual.</p>

<p>We are wrapping up the development in the <code>master</code> branch for v2.99.2, the first unstable release in the 2.99 series leading up to v3.0 some time in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>We know that this release is anticipated by various demographics of our users, from people doing digital painting (you can hotplug a graphic tablet now) to photographers using a 4K display (the icon size is right for them now) to people generally wishing to drop <span>GTK2</span> and Python 2 from their operating&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>Having said that, there is a warning to make as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>While we are looking forward to feedback and bug reports, we do not recommend upcoming v2.99.2 for use in production. There are both improvements and regressions from the 2.10.x series. Full details will be published when the release is out&nbsp;(soon).</p>
<p>For the time being, don’t forget you can <a href="https://www.gimp.org/donating/">donate to the project and personally
fund several <span>GIMP</span> developers</a>, as a way to give
back, and to accelerate the development of <span>GIMP</span>.</p>
