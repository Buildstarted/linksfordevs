					<li><p>I've been writing about Google's efforts to deprecate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>, the protocol of the web. This is a summary of why I am opposed to it. <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=about">DW</a></p></li>

							<li><p>Something bad could happen to my pages in transit from a server to the user's web browser. </p></li>
							<li><p>It's not hard to convert to HTTPS and it doesn't cost a lot.</p></li>
							<li><p>Google is going to warn people about my site being "not secure." So if I don't want people to be scared away, I should just do what they want me to do.</p></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<li>
				
				<ul id="idOutlineLevel4">
					<li><p>The web is an open platform, not a corporate platform.</p></li>
					<li><p>It is defined by its stability. 25-plus years and it's still going strong.</p></li>
					<li><p>Google is a guest on the web, as we all are. Guests don't make the rules.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<li>
				
				<ul id="idOutlineLevel5">
					<li><p>A lot of the web consists of archives. Files put in places that no one maintains. They just work. There's no one there to do the work that Google wants all sites to do. And some people have large numbers of domains and sub-domains hosted on all kinds of software Google never thought about. Places where the work required to convert wouldn't be justified by the possible benefit. The reason there's so much diversity is that the web is an open thing, it was never owned. </p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<li>
				
				<ul id="idOutlineLevel6">
					<li><p>Google has spent a lot of effort to convince you that HTTP is not good. Let me have the floor for a moment to tell you why HTTP is the best thing ever. </p></li>
					<li><p>Its simplicity is what made the web work. It created an explosion of new applications. It may be hard to believe that there was a time when Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, Gmail, Twitter etc didn't exist. That was because the networking standards prior to the web were complicated and not well documented. The explosion happened because the web is simple. Where earlier protocols were hard to build on, the web is easy.</p></li>
					<li><p>I don't think the explosion is over. I want to make it easier and easier for people to run their own web servers. Google is doing what the programming priesthood always does, building the barrier to entry higher, making things more complicated, giving themselves an exclusive. This means only super nerds will be able to put up sites. And we will lose a lot of sites that were quickly posted on a whim, over the 25 years the web has existed, by people that didn't fully understand what they were doing. That's also the glory of the web. Fumbling around in the dark actually gets you somewhere. In worlds created by corporate programmers, it's often impossible to find your way around, by design.</p></li>
					<li><p>The web is a social agreement not to break things. It's served us for 25 years. I don't want to give it up because a bunch of nerds at Google think they know best. </p></li>
					<li><p>The web is like the Grand Canyon. It's a big natural thing, a resource, an inspiration, and like the canyon it deserves our protection. It's a place of experimentation and learning. It's also useful for big corporate websites like Google. All views of the web are important, especially ones that big companies don't understand or respect. It's how progress happens in technology.</p></li>
					<li><p>Keeping the web running simple is as important as net neutrality.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<li>
				
				<ul id="idOutlineLevel7">
					<li><p>Google makes a popular browser and is a tech industry leader. They can, they believe, encircle the web, and at first warn users as they access HTTP content. Very <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-tightens-noose-on-http-chrome-to-stick-not-secure-on-pages-with-search-fields/">likely</a> <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure">they will do more</a>, requiring the user to consent to open a page, and then to block the pages outright.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<li>
				
				<ul id="idOutlineLevel8">
					<li><p>Many of the sites they will label as "not secure" don't ask the user for any information. Of course users won't understand that. Many will take the warning seriously and hit the Back button, having no idea why they're doing it. Of course Google knows this. It's the kind of nasty political tactic we expect from corrupt political leaders, not leading tech companies. </p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<li>
				
				<ul id="idOutlineLevel9">
					<li><p>They tell us to worry about man-in-the-middle attacks that might modify content, but fail to mention that they can do it in the browser, even if you use a "secure" protocol. They are the one entity you must trust above all. No way around it. </p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<li>
				
				<ul id="idOutlineLevel10">
					<li><p>When they say some percentage of web traffic is HTTPS, that doesn't measure the scope of the problem. A lot of HTTP-served sites get very few hits, yet still have valuable ideas and must be preserved.  </p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<li>
				
				<ul id="idOutlineLevel11">
					<li><p>If Google succeeds, it will make a lot of the web's history inaccessible. People put stuff on the web precisely so it would be preserved over time. That's why it's important that no one has the power to change what the web is.</p></li>
					<li><p>It's like a massive book burning, at a much bigger scale than ever done before.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<li>
				
				<ul id="idOutlineLevel12">
					<li><p>Why force people to do it? This suggests that the main <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a010645">benefit</a> is for Google, not for people who own the content. If it were such a pressing problem we'd do it because we want to, not because we're being forced to. </p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<li>
				
				<ul id="idOutlineLevel13">
					<li><p>Finally, what is the value in being safe? </p></li>
					<li><p>Twitter and Facebook are like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL">AOL</a> in the old pre-web days. They are run by companies who are committed to provide a safe experience. They make tradeoffs for that. Limited linking. No styles. Character limits. Blocking, muting, reporting, norms. Etc etc. Think of them as Disney-like experiences. </p></li>
					<li><p>The web is not safe. That is correct. We don't want every place to be safe. So people can be wild and experiment and try out new ideas. It's why the web has been the proving ground for so much incredible stuff over its history. </p></li>
					<li><p>Lots of things aren't safe. Crossing the street. Bike riding in Manhattan. Falling in love. We do them anyway. You can't be safe all the time. Life itself isn't safe. </p></li>
					<li><p>If Google succeeds in making the web controlled and bland, we'll just have to reinvent the web outside of Google's sphere. Let's save some time, and create the new web out of the web itself. </p></li>
					<li><p>PS: Of course we want parts of the web to be safe. Banking websites, for example. But my <a href="http://scripting.com/2001/09.html">blog archive</a> from 2001? Really there's no need for special provisions there. </p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			<li>
				
				<ul id="idOutlineLevel14">
					<li><p>On June 20, 2018, I got an <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/06/25/emailFromGoogle.png">email</a> from Google, as the owner of <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a>.</p></li>
					<li><p>According to the email I should "migrate to HTTPS to avoid triggering the new warning on your site and to help protect users' data." </p></li>
					<li><p>It's a blog. I don't ask for any user data. </p></li>
					<li><p>Google’s <i>not secure</i> message means this: “Google tried to take control of the open web and this site said no.”</p></li>
					</ul>
