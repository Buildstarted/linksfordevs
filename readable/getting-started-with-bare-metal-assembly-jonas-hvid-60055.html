<p>Seeing a program you wrote running directly on the bare metal is
deeply satisfying to anyone who enjoys writing software. And it turns out
that creating such a program from scratch is easier than it sounds. The
hardest part is figuring out where to start. In this tutorial, I'll show
you how to write, build and run the classic "Hello, World!" in pure
assembly.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://johv.dk/blog/bare-metal-assembly-tutorial-screenshot.png">
<figcaption>"Hello, World!" inside the UEFI shell. You could also boot
directly into the application.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Well, almost – on a modern computer, our assembly application
doesn't just have direct access to the hardware. Instead it must
communicate with an intermediary firmware layer on the motherboard,
through the so-called <i>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</i>
(UEFI).</p>
<p>Creating a "Hello, World!" UEFI application is a three-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up a virtual machine with UEFI support.</li>
<li>Install an assembler that can output UEFI applications.</li>
<li>Write the actual program and run it!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Setting up QEMU</h2>
<p>We <em>could</em> test our application by repeatedly copying it to a
USB drive, rebooting our computer and then seeing if it works. Obviously,
we don't want to do that. Instead, we'll be testing our application
inside a virtual machine, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> is
a great fit for this purpose.</p>
<section>
<h3>Step 1 — Install QEMU</h3>
<p>If you are using a GNU/Linux distribution, there's a good chance
that it has a <code>qemu</code> package available. I'll assume that
you're using Ubuntu, but you can easily adapt these instructions to
whichever system you're using.</p>
<pre>$ sudo apt-get install qemu</pre>
<p>Once the intallation finishes, you should have
<code>qemu-system-x86_64</code> availabe in your path:</p>
<pre>$ qemu-system-x86_64 --version
QEMU emulator version 2.11.1(Debian 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.23)
Copyright (c) 2003-2017 Fabrice Bellard and the QEMU Project developers</pre>
</section>
<p>While most modern computers come with UEFI-support built-in, QEMU does not.
Instead, we will use something called
<a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/OVMF">OVMF</a>,
which is a firmware layer that adds UEFI support to QEMU.</p>
<section>
<h3>Step 2 — Set up OVMF</h3>
<p>Again, there is probably a package available for your distribution.
If you are using Ubuntu, run:</p>
<pre>$ sudo apt-get install ovmf</pre>
<p>This should install the file <code>OVMF.fd</code> somewhere on your system. Figure out
where:</p>
<pre>$ find / -name OVMF.fd 2&gt;/dev/null
/usr/share/ovmf/OVMF.fd</pre>
<p>Then, go ahead and copy this file to your working directory:</p>
<pre>$ cp /usr/share/ovmf/OVMF.fd .</pre>
<p>(On some GNU/Linux distributions, the relevant package may install
both a 32-bit and a 64-bit version; in this case, use the 64-bit
version.)</p>
</section>
<p>The UEFI firmware provides a bare-bones environment called the UEFI
shell. We'll want to test the application that we build from this shell.
Let's check that it's working correctly.</p>
<section>
<h3>Step 3 — Try the UEFI shell.</h3> <p>You should have the
file <code>OVMF.fd</code> available in your working directory from step
2. To tell QEMU about this firmware, use the argument <code>-bios
OVMF.fd</code>. We also need to specify <code>-net none</code>
so QEMU won't try to boot over the network:</p>
<pre>$ qemu-system-x86_64 -bios OVMF.fd -net none</pre>
<p>This will land you in a shell that looks a little something like this:</p>
<pre>UEFI Interactive Shell v2.2
EDK II
UEFI v2.70 (EDK II, 0x00010000)
Mapping table
     BLK0: Alias(s):
          PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1,0x1)/Ata(0x0)
Press ESC in 1 seconds to skip startup.nsh or any other key to continue.
Shell&gt;</pre>
<p>Try typing <code>help -b</code> to get a list of
commands.</p>
</section>
<p>We need some way of accessing the executable that we build from
inside the UEFI shell. The shell can read FAT32 file systems.
Conveniently, QEMU can mount a directory in the host file system as a
FAT32 formatted drive in the virtual machine.</p>
<section>
<h3>Step 4 — Open files from the UEFI shell</h3>
<p>We'll store the files on our emulated drive in a directory on the
host called <code>drive/</code>. For now, let's just create a small test
file that we'll try to read:</p>
<pre>$ mkdir drive
$ echo "This is a test" &gt; drive/test.txt</pre>
<p>To make this directory available as a FAT32 formatted drive inside QEMU,
use the <code>-drive</code> option like this:</p>
<pre>$ qemu-system-x86_64 -bios OVMF.fd -net none -drive format=raw,file=fat:rw:<u>drive/</u></pre>
<p>Inside QEMU, you will now see that there is a new file system
available called <code>FS0:</code>. Switch to it and look for the text
file that you just created:</p>
<pre>Shell&gt; fs0:
FS0:\&gt; dir
Directory of: FS0:\
03/21/2020  17:46                  15  test.txt
03/21/2020  16:49              10,565  NvVars
          2 File(s)      10,580 bytes
          0 Dir(s)
FS0:\&gt; cat test.txt
This is a test</pre>
</section>
<p>Great! We can now transfer our executable into QEMU and open it from
the shell. This gives us an environment that is very similar to what we
would get if we inserted a FAT32 formatted USB drive into a real computer
with a UEFI shell installed.</p>
<h2>Assembling a UEFI application with FASM</h2>
<p>It would be nice if we could just put a bunch of machine code on a USB
drive and have our computer execute that. Unfortunately, that's not how it
works. All modern operating systems store executables as
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file">object files</a>.
An object file contains both the machine code itself and some information
about how that code should be loaded and executed.</p>
<p>The specific object file format used by UEFI is the so-called <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable">Portable
Executable</a> format. This format is also used by Microsoft Windows
for <code>.exe</code> and <code>.dll</code> files.</p>
<p>An assembler is a program that generates an object file from
assembly code. There are many assemblers, but for this tutorial we'll be
using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://flatassembler.net/">FASM</a>,
because it's easy to use and has built-in support for the object file
format we need.</p>
<section>
<h3>Step 5 — Install FASM</h3>
<p>On Ubuntu, FASM is available in the standard repository:</p>
<pre>$ sudo apt-get install fasm</pre>
<p>Check that you have FASM installed and in your path:</p>
<pre>$ fasm
flat assembler  version 1.73.13
usage: fasm <source> [output]
optional settings:
 -m &lt;limit&gt;         set the limit in kilobytes for the available memory
 -p &lt;limit&gt;         set the maximum allowed number of passes
 -d &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;  define symbolic variable
 -s &lt;file&gt;          dump symbolic information for debugging</pre>
</section>
<p>FASM can generate code for many different output formats. We need to
tell it to generate a 64-bit Portable Executable with some extra flags
set to specify that it's a UEFI application. This is done using the
<code>format</code> directive:</p>
<pre>format pe64 efi</pre>
<p>Let's start by writing a program that is even simpler than "Hello,
World!" – a program that does absolutely nothing. This program will
start at the <code>main:</code> label and then immediately return to the
caller:</p>
<pre>entry main
main:
  ret</pre>
<p>The Portable Executable format, like most executable file formats,
supports multiple <i>sections</i>. One section contains the
program code, another contains data that is loaded into RAM when the
program is started, and so on. The machine code should sit in a section
called <code>.text</code>, and we should specify that data in this
section may be both executed and read:</p>
<pre>section '.text' executable readable</pre>
<p>Thus, the final program, which does nothing and then exists, is:</p>
<pre>format pe64 efi
entry main

section '.text' executable readable

main:
  ret</pre>
<p>Now we just need to assemble this program, and then we'll be able to
run it inside QEMU.</p>
<section>
<h3>Step 6 — Assemble and run an empty executable</h3>
<p>Save the program as <code>empty.asm</code>:</p>
<pre>$ cat &gt; empty.asm
format pe64 efi
entry main

section '.text' executable readable

main:
  ret</pre>
<p>Then, assmble it with FASM, and put the output in <code>drive/empty</code></p>
<pre>$ mkdir -p drive
$ fasm empty.asm drive/empty</pre>
<p>Now, we can mount <code>drive/</code> as a FAT32 formatted drive in
QEMU. Then, we just need to run the application off the drive from
inside the UEFI shell. If everything goes according to plan, you should
see nothing happen:</p>
<pre>$ qemu-system-x86_64 -bios OVMF.fd -net none -drive format=raw,file=fat:rw:drive/
UEFI Interactive Shell v2.2
EDK II
UEFI v2.70 (EDK II, 0x00010000)
Mapping table
      FS0: Alias(s):HD0a1:;BLK1:
          PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1,0x1)/Ata(0x0)/HD(1,MBR,0xBE1AFDFA,0x3F,0xFBFC1)
     BLK0: Alias(s):
          PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1,0x1)/Ata(0x0)
     BLK2: Alias(s):
          PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1,0x1)/Ata(0x0)
Press ESC in 1 seconds to skip startup.nsh or any other key to continue.
Shell&gt; fs0:\empty
Shell&gt;</pre>
</section>
<p>Now that we have figured out how to assemble a UEFI application and run
it inside QEMU, let's see if we can do something a little bit more
interesting. Yes, it's finally time to write our "Hello, World!"
program!</p>
<h2>Using UEFI services to write output</h2>
<p>The UEFI firmware provides some standardized services. Among them is a
service that we can use to show text on the screen called the Simple Text
Output Protocol. The <a href="https://uefi.org/specifications" rel="nofollow">UEFI Specification</a>
contains everything you could ever possibly want to know about UEFI
– and then some. (This tutorial uses version 2.8, updated in
Feburary 2020.)</p>
<p>For the purposes of writing "Hello, World!", we are mostly interested
in the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.4 (Data types and x86-64 calling conventions)</li>
<li>Section 4 (EFI System Table)</li>
<li>Section 12 (Console support)</li>
</ul>
<p>If anything in this tutorial is unclear, you can probably find an answer
to your question in one of those sections. I'll try to summarize the
important parts here.</p>
<p>When our UEFI application is started, a pointer to the EFI System
Table will be in <code>RDX</code>. The System Table is a structure that
contains, among other things, a pointer to a Simple Text Output Protocol.
This protocol is itself a structure that contains a function to print
output to the screen.</p>
<p>The specification contains definitions of all the structures that we
need to worry about. On page 92, we find:</p>
<pre>typedef struct {
        EFI_TABLE_HEADER                Hdr;
        CHAR16                          *FirmwareVendor;
        UINT32                          FirmwareRevision;
        EFI_HANDLE                      ConsoleInHandle;
        EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_INPUT_PROTOCOL  *ConIn;
        EFI_HANDLE                      ConsoleOutHandle;
        EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL *ConOut;
        EFI_HANDLE                      StandardErrorHandle;
        EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL *StdErr;
        EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES            *RuntimeServices;
        EFI_BOOT_SERVICES               *BootServices;
        UINTN                           NumberOfTableEntries;
        EFI_CONFIGURATION_TABLE         *ConfigurationTable;
} EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE;</pre>
<p>We need to calculate the offset to <code>ConOut</code> inside this
structure. The header is 12 bytes (cf. the definition on page 90),
<code>UINT32</code> is 4 bytes, and <code>EFI_HANDLE</code> and all
pointer types are 8 bytes. However, note that each member of the
structure is 8-byte aligned; this means that there are 4 bytes of padding
after the header and the <code>UINT32</code>. So, in fact, the
<code>ConOut</code> pointer will be at index <span>(12 + 4)
+ (4 + 4) + 8 · 5 = 64</span> in the structure.</p>
<p>Thus, we can load the Simple Text Output Protocol <code>ConOut</code>
like so:</p>
<pre>
mov rcx, [rdx + 64]</pre>
<p>The Simple Text Output Protocol structure looks like this (page 442):</p>
<pre>typedef struct _EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL {
        EFI_TEXT_RESET               Reset;
        EFI_TEXT_STRING              OutputString;
        EFI_TEXT_TEST_STRING         TestString;
        EFI_TEXT_QUERY_MODE          QueryMode;
        EFI_TEXT_SET_MODE            SetMode;
        EFI_TEXT_SET_ATTRIBUTE       SetAttribute;
        EFI_TEXT_CLEAR_SCREEN        ClearScreen;
        EFI_TEXT_SET_CURSOR_POSITION SetCursorPosition;
        EFI_TEXT_ENABLE_CURSOR       EnableCursor;
        SIMPLE_TEXT_OUTPUT_MODE      *Mode;
} EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL;</pre>
<p>We are interested in calling the function <code>OutputString</code>,
which is at offset 8 inside this structure. (Each function pointer is 8
bytes.) This function takes two arguments: a pointer to the Output
Protocol and the string itself (see page 444).</p>
<p>We can load the address of the function into <code>RAX</code> like so:</p>
<pre>
mov rax, [rcx + 8]</pre>
<p>FASM has a handy <code>du</code> instruction, which we can use to
store a 16-bit string. (See the <a href="https://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual" rel="nofollow">FASM manual</a> for more information about how
<code>du</code> works.) The string should end with a carriage return and a
line feed. We'll store the string in the <code>.data</code> section like
so:</p>
<pre>section '.data' readable writable
string du 'Hello, World!', 0xD, 0xA, 0</pre>
<p>The calling conventions (see page 27) specify that the function takes
its first argument in <code>RCX</code> and its second argument in
<code>RDX</code>. We must also allocate 32 bytes of so-called <i>shadow
space</i> on the stack before calling the function. Once we have set
everything up, we can call the function in <code>RAX</code>:</p>
<pre>
mov rdx, string


sub rsp, 32


call rax


add rsp, 32

ret</pre>
<p>And that's our "Hello, World!" program. Now we need to assemble it
into an executable.</p>
<section>
<h3>Step 7 — Assemble "Hello, World!"</h3> <p>Create a file with
the full source code for the assembly program, and save it as
<code>hello.asm</code>:
</p><pre>$ cat &gt; hello.asm
format pe64 efi
entry main

section '.text' executable readable

main:
  ;; Recall that RDX contains a pointer to the System Table when
  ;; our application is called. So rdx + 64 is the address of the
  ;; pointer to ConOut, and [rdx + 64] is the pointer itself.
  mov rcx, [rdx + 64]

  ;; Now, RCX contains the ConOut pointer. Thus, the address of
  ;; the OutputString function is at rcx + 8. We'll move this
  ;; function into RAX:
  mov rax, [rcx + 8]

  ;; We already have the ConOut pointer in RCX. Let's load the
  ;; string pointer into RDX:
  mov rdx, string

  ;; Set up the shadow space. We just need to reserve 32 bytes
  ;; on the stack, which we do by manipulating the stack pointer:
  sub rsp, 32

  ;; Now we can call the OutputText function, whose address is
  ;; in the RAX register:
  call rax

  ;; Finally, we'll clean up the shadow space and then return:
  add rsp, 32

  ret

section '.data' readable writable

string du 'Hello, World!', 0xD, 0xA, 0</pre>
<p>Then, assemble it with FASM, and save the output in <code>drive/hello</code>:</p>
<pre>$ fasm hello.asm drive/hello</pre>
</section>
<p>With the program in the <code>drive/</code> directory, we can mount
this directory inside QEMU as a FAT32 formatted drive in the same way
that we did before. And then we can finally run our "Hello, World!"
program!</p>
<section>
<h3>Step 8 — Run "Hello, World!" in QEMU</h3>
<p>You should have <code>drive/hello</code> from the previous step. Run
QEMU:</p>
<pre>$ qemu-system-x86_64 -bios OVMF.fd -net none -drive format=raw,file=fat:rw:drive/</pre>
<p>Then, in the UEFI shell execute <code>FS0:\hello</code>:
</p><pre>Shell&gt; FS0:\hello
Hello, World!
Shell&gt;</pre>
</section>
<p>And there you go!</p>
<p>Perhaps you would like to see your "Hello, World!" program running in
all its glory on your real, physical hardware. This is actually pretty
easy to do. You just need to format a USB drive with a FAT32 file system,
and then you can put your file directly on the USB drive. If you have a
UEFI shell built-in to your firmware, then you can run the program from
there.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can save the file as <code>\EFI\BOOT\BOOTx64.EFI</code>
on the USB drive; this will make the UEFI firmware think that it's a
bootable device (like a USB drive with an operating system or a
bootloader on it), and let you select that drive from the boot menu. If
you're planning to boot directly into your "Hello, World!" program, you
should change the <code>ret</code> instruction to <code>jmp $</code>.
This will cause the program to wait forever so that it doesn't shut down
immediately after booting from it.</p>
<section>
<h3>Step 9 — Create a bootable USB drive.</h3>
<p>Start by replacing <code>ret</code> with <code>jmp $</code> so you
can acutally see your program running. Then reassemble it to <code>hello</code>:</p>
<pre>$ sed -i 's/ret$/jmp $/' hello.asm
$ fasm hello.asm hello</pre>
<p>I'll assume that you have an empty USB drive available as
<code>/dev/sdx</code>. We'll need <code>mkfs.vfat</code> to format the
USB drive. On Ubunut, you can install this with:</p>
<pre>$ sudo apt-get install dosfstools</pre>
<p>Now, format the drive as FAT32:</p>
<pre>$ sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sdx</pre>
<p>Then, mount the device:</p>
<pre>$ mkdir -p mnt
$ sudo mount /dev/sdx mnt</pre>
<p>Now, copy the <code>hello</code> executable to <code>\EFI\BOOT\BOOTx64.EFI</code> on the device:</p>
<pre>$ mkdir -p mnt/EFI/BOOT
$ cp hello mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI
$ sudo umount mnt</pre>
</section>
<p>Now you should be able to plug your USB drive into your computer and
boot from it!</p>
<p>Of course, a "Hello, World!" program isn't all that interesting. But
with this, you have a good starting point to make much more intersting
applications. In fact, it's possible to make an entire operating system
as a UEFI application. If this is something that sounds interesting to
you, I'd recommend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page">OSDev Wiki</a> as an
excellent place to get started. Have fun!</p>
