Not only that, they made the discussion of new language features more transparent. Anyone can follow along the language discussions. This is good for the language, but also brings its own set of challenges. It's hard to keep track of what's new and which features are useful in situations you may care about. In this talk, Phil Haack starts to build a fictional new competitor to GitHub called HaackHub and demonstrates some new features of C# 7 and 8 that are useful along the way. This comes from his experience working on Aboard (<a href="https://getaboard.net/" title="https://getaboard.net/" target="__blank">https://getaboard.net/</a>). Learn about C# features that may be useful in your real-world day to day coding.</p><p>Agenda<br>========================================<br>5:15 PM - 5:30 PM - Opening Remarks<br>5:30 PM - 6:30 PM - Presentation &amp; QA</p><p>About the Speaker<br>========================================<br>Phil Haack is the founder of Haacked LLC where he coaches software organizations to become the best versions of themselves.</p><p>To do this, Phil draws upon his over twenty years of experience in the software industry. Most recently, he was a director of engineering at GitHub and helped make GitHub friendly to developers on the Microsoft platform.</p><p>Prior to GitHub, he was a Senior Program Manager at Microsoft responsible for shipping ASP.NET MVC, NuGet, among other projects. These products had permissive open source licenses and ushered in Microsoft’s Open Source era.</p><p>Phil is a co-author of GitHub for Dummies as well as the popular Professional ASP.NET MVC series and regularly speaks at conferences around the world. He’s also made several appearances on technology podcasts such as .NET Rocks, Hanselminutes, Herding Code, and The Official jQuery Podcast.</p><p>You can find him sharing his thoughts at <a href="https://haacked.com/" title="https://haacked.com/" target="__blank">https://haacked.com/</a> or on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/haacked." title="https://twitter.com/haacked." target="__blank">https://twitter.com/haacked.</a></p><p>Online Meeting Details<br>====================================</p><p>Andrew Karcher is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.</p><p>Topic: SDDNUG - May Meeting<br>Time: May 5,[masked]:00 PM Pacific Time (US and Canada)</p><p>Join Zoom Meeting: Link Provided when you RSVP</p><p>One tap mobile<br>[masked],,[masked]#,,1#,758172# US (San Jose)<br>[masked],,[masked]#,,1#,758172# US (San Jose)</p><p>Dial by your location<br>[masked] US (San Jose)<br>[masked] US (San Jose)<br>[masked] US (Houston)<br>[masked] US (Tacoma)<br>[masked] US (Chicago)<br>[masked] US (New York)<br>[masked] US (Germantown)<br>Meeting ID:[masked]<br>Password:[masked]<br>Find your local number: <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/u/kfsV3bzCy" title="https://us02web.zoom.us/u/kfsV3bzCy" target="__blank">https://us02web.zoom.us/u/kfsV3bzCy</a></p></div></div></div></div>
