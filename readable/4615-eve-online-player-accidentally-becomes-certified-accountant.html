That, combined with his battle plan during a recent corporation war, were enough to fully qualify him for a CPA license.</span></p><p><span>While it is not currently understood how, exactly, Kirchner was awarded his CPA license — one appeared in the mail on Monday, notarized by the city clerk — the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants confirmed that the license was not produced in error, and it certifies Kirchner to be a practicing accountant.</span></p><p><span>“I’m flattered, really,” Kirchner explained, when reached for comment. “You don’t think that a video game is going to be the path to a new and exciting career.” </span></p><p><span>Kirchner, who works as a hostage negotiator for the local police department, explained that EVE Online is how he injects a little excitement into his day. “Look, it puts money on the table, but it all gets a little monotonous after awhile,” said Kirchner. “You go in, you find out who you have to talk out of killing hostages, you clock out by five. With EVE, I get to work with my true passion, spreadsheets.”</span></p><p><span>Kirchner plays EVE online in his “battle-station” which consists of four grey fabric walls approximately four feet high, an old office chair with a busted back, and a desk with a small picture of Kirchner posed with his two chihuahuas. </span></p><p><span>“This is my fantasy world,” said Kirchner. “Here I get to make all the spreadsheets I want. I can run any kind of break-even analysis. I can do any cost/benefit rundown I dream of across the universe of EVE Online and now I get to do that for Ernst &amp; Young. What more could a person want?”</span></p></div></div></div></div>
