<b><br></b>
This is my first new ventilator design in 12 years.</p>
<div><p>
I have been told that a pressure control ventilator
design would be more useful for caring for patients with ARDS from such a
pandemic as we are experiencing now.<span>&nbsp; </span>“These
<span>&nbsp;</span>designs use extremely high RPM turbine
blowers to generate high flow at high pressure. Driven by electric motors that
can stop, start and adjust flow in milliseconds. Small package, high
reliability and tough construction. A flow sensor is mandatory for measuring
the flow into the patient and to calculate the Tidal Volume (Vt). “</p><o:p></o:p></div>
<div>
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><p>So I looked for these tiny blowers.&nbsp; The reason they are small is not just so that
they can be compact.&nbsp; They need to be
high RPM with low mass of motor and impeller so that they can change the speeds
very quickly so as to provide the desired pressure profile.&nbsp;</p></div>

<div>
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><p>Such a pump is available, say from Digikey, but only a
few dozen are in stock and then multiple weeks to order more.&nbsp; That won’t work for us.&nbsp; You could also get them from China.&nbsp; There are obvious supply chain problems
there.&nbsp; One of my original requirements
for the Pandemic Ventilator Project was that it be able to be built from parts
that we already have around because I assumed supply chains would be disrupted by
the pandemic as well.&nbsp; Well, that turned
out to be true.</p></div>

<div>
<!--[if !supportLists]--><p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p><!--[endif]--><p>The blower in this design is a big one that runs
on AC and not a nice little low voltage brushless.&nbsp; (Sorry, no intrinsic battery backup
here.)&nbsp; The blower runs full on all the
time.&nbsp; (Will be noisy too.)</p><o:p></o:p></div>
<div>
<!--[if !supportLists]--><p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p><!--[endif]--><p>In order to rapidly change the pressure there is
a valve arrangement that opens the pressure control valve and closes the waste
gate with the linear actuator shutting down the outlet flow to rapidly bring up
the pressure to start the cycle. The motor operates a turning arm that is
connected to the valves to rotate them so as increase or decrease the opening
in the pipes.&nbsp; The motor could be a
stepper or a fast turning motor with gear reduction and some method of angle feedback.&nbsp; (I am sure the RC model car guys can figure this
out - it’s fundamentally like the steering part.)</p><o:p></o:p></div>
<div>
<!--[if !supportLists]--><p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p><!--[endif]--><p>Pressure is then controlled by feedback from the
feed pressure sensor adjusting the servo motor and additional fine tuning from
the linear actuator controlled slot valve.</p><o:p></o:p></div>
<div>
<!--[if !supportLists]--><p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p><!--[endif]--><p>The flow meter monitors the inspiratory volume
and when the conditions are met to exhale, the pump pressure is cut off by the
servo motor and the linear actuator opens he slot valve to control the flow to the
outlet.&nbsp; The linear actuator then adjusts the slot valve position to maintain a prescribed PEEP pressure utilizing feedback from the patient
pressure sensor.</p><o:p></o:p></div>
<div>
<!--[if !supportLists]--><p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p><!--[endif]--><p>With the right software, you could control rates,
tidal volumes, minute volumes, pressure profiles, PEEP to whatever you want, and
also offer patient controlled breath initiation.</p><o:p></o:p></div>

<div>
<!--[if !supportLists]--><p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p><!--[endif]--><p>I added a filter to reduce cross contamination
and protect workers.&nbsp; I don’t know, that
may be optional if everyone is wearing PPE in any case.</p><o:p></o:p><p>

<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>What you actually now see is version 2.&nbsp; I reaarranged the layout to minimize dead space, I added the input tube for humidified oxygen increased air, and added a recirculation loop to minimize the waste of oxygen.</p></div>

<div><p>
Anyway, this is my first shot at a design for this
style.&nbsp; Actually, looking at it, it seems
too simple a design to me.&nbsp; I must have
left something out.&nbsp; I am sure readers
will find flaws and maybe offer some design improvements.&nbsp; Any maker group, anywhere please feel free to
use whatever you want from this.</p>
<p><span>Next Steps:</span></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The design should be reviewed by experts in ventilator use as well as engineers with experience in device control to be sure it is adequate and relatively optimized.</li>
<li>Need to come up with a list of potential parts and interface criteria for sensors</li>
<li>Specify control system processor, drivers etc.</li>
<li>Specification list (state table) for all modes of the device to aid in programming</li>
<li>Basic machine control program is written,</li>
<li>Interface program for operator control, alarms and setup</li>
<li>Modify interface look and feel to clone an existing popular ventilator design</li>
<li>Functional, safety and usability testing</li>
<li>Operators manual.</li>
<li><span>All of these steps are of course iterative and involve testing and user feedback at each level</span></li>
</ul>
