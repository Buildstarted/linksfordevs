<p>I have too many ideas. If these ideas were all great, this would be <span>OK</span>. Unfortunately, they aren’t. Many are bad ideas. The rest tend to be unsuitable for our team of only two people.</p>
<p>After 20 years in business, we’ve learned who we are and what we want. We are not interested in building a big company or disrupting an industry. We like small products that we can build in a reasonable amount of time—and maintain without going bonkers.</p>
<p>Following is a brief (and evolving<a href="#footnote-1YGN" id="ref-1YGN"><sup>1</sup></a>) criteria I use for helping to evaluate whether a product idea is worth further investigation. Most times it invalidates the idea. This is great because it prevents us from building something that’s bound to fail.</p>
<p>Any new product we build must be:</p>
<h2 id="stupidly-simple">Stupidly simple</h2>
<p>Most things are more complicated than they first seem. So, anything we build must perform a single function<a href="#footnote-2YGN" id="ref-2YGN"><sup>2</sup></a> that can be explained in one sentence.</p>
<h2 id="convenient-not-necessarily-better">Convenient (not necessarily better)</h2>
<p>Our product needs to solve an explicit problem <em>more easily</em> than any existing alternative. Most won’t care if it’s better, or if it does all that a competing product does, so much as they’ll value it being more convenient.</p>
<h2 id="built-for-a-narrow-audience">Built for a narrow audience</h2>
<p>Marketing a product is hard. It’s even harder when our audience is vague (especially since we’re small).<a href="#footnote-3YGN" id="ref-3YGN"><sup>3</sup></a> By clearly identifying our audience we’re able to find them and get our product in front of them.<a href="#footnote-4YGN" id="ref-4YGN"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="have-a-clear-path-to-market">Have a clear path to market</h2>
<p>Before drawing a mock-up or writing a line of code, we must come up with a way to reach our audience<a href="#footnote-5YGN" id="ref-5YGN"><sup>5</sup></a>. This is easy to put off until it’s too late—at which point it can be daunting.</p>
<h2 id="available-for-purchase">Available for purchase</h2>
<p>No form of product validation is as telling as a payment. We need to collect credit card details as early as possible—and get paid. We ought to do this even if our product feels insignificant/incomplete.</p>
<p><em>And now for the bonus round:</em></p>
<p>(These considerations are less essential, but certainly relevant to our particular setup.)</p>
<h2 id="produce-recurring-revenue">Produce recurring revenue</h2>
<p>It’s hard to maintain software that’s paid for only once. Conversely, perpetual revenue (even in small amounts) compounds over time<a href="#footnote-6YGN" id="ref-6YGN"><sup>6</sup></a>. This allows us to improve the product and adequately service our customers.</p>
<h2 id="impossible-to-hold">Impossible to hold</h2>
<p>There are many physical objects I’d like to build. However, we have no expertise in manufacturing. We know little about warehousing, fulfillment, and returns—none-to-mention all the other things we’re too ill-informed to even recognize. For this reason, we only work on products that we can’t hold in our hands.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The above list isn’t necessarily adaptable to others. You might want to build a large company. Perhaps your idea is complex and requires venture capital to build out. Or, you could have experience producing physical products. That’s cool. None of what I present here is absolute.</p>
<p>Instead, this is something I make note of in part for my record-keeping purposes. Like I said earlier, I find this type of criteria useful for evaluating ideas. Posting it here will allow me to reference it again in the future.</p>

<li id="footnote-1YGN"><p>I’ve created a number of these lists over the years, but tend to lose them. I also noticed that over time certain points seemed more essential than others. So, I’ll return to this and augment it as I learn new things.<a href="#ref-1YGN">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="footnote-2YGN"><p>It’s also wise to fight the impulse to add features.<a href="#ref-2YGN">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="footnote-3YGN"><p>Founders often worry that a market is too small. They should be more concerned about their market being overly broad.<a href="#ref-3YGN">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="footnote-4YGN"><p>For example, internet marketers are hard to target. Conversely, RVers in the U.S. are a defined population that’s reasonably easy to get in front of.<a href="#ref-4YGN">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="footnote-5YGN"><p>So far my favorite go-to-market approach involves: 1. Making something that removes a problem for a small group of people. 2. Putting it on a Reddit forum for that activity. 3. Letting them tell their friends about it.<a href="#ref-5YGN">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="footnote-6YGN"><p>This only works so long as our customers continue to get value from what we built.<a href="#ref-6YGN">↩</a></p></li>
