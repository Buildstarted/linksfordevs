Today I am going to tell you how Unigine managed to improve the image quality in real-time 3D graphics using Screen Space Ray-Traced Global Illumination, what challenges did we face and why this technology is so important.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Everyone who worked with real-time 3D graphics knows the dilemma: either to choose realistic static (baked), or less realistic dynamic lighting. We’ve also faced this dilemma while working on the <a href="http://benchmark.unigine.com/superposition?utm_source=80lv&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=ssrtgi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superposition Benchmark</a> project. Unlike regular real-time applications, we have over 900 dynamic objects in a single room. All of these objects can be moved freely which significantly affects lighting. This scene unveiled a set of typical problems in modern 3D engines.</p><p>Here are the challenges we faced:</p><p><strong>1. With baked lighting we can’t move dynamic objects</strong></p><p>Suppose we pre-calculate lightmaps for each object offline, using ray tracing, and then bake them into textures. We would surely get a completely realistic and convincing lighting but, all objects would have to remain static – we couldn’t move them. Apart from looking plain and boring in VR, this would be considered as a technologically outdated solution.</p><p><strong>2. Mixing dynamic and static lighting gives us an inconsistent image</strong></p><p>It’s possible to bake lighting for static geometry (lightmaps or static AO), but this baked lighting won’t affect dynamic objects. As a result we can get too bright objects on dark shelves. Even if we try to improve the scene by content adjustment – inserting a dark environment probe into each bookcase, it still won’t look realistic. The fakeness of real-time graphics will still be evident.</p><p><strong>3. Using environment probes gives sharp transitions of ambient lighting on the adjacent surfaces with different normals</strong></p><p>We used environment probes for ambient lighting, applying it to objects’ surfaces according to the following scheme: if a surface normal points to the left, we use the lighting baked from the left side, if it points to the right – we use what was baked from the right. This is a classic method, which is now widely used in real-time for ambient lighting. However, it produces sharp transitions of ambient lighting on the adjacent surfaces with different normals which looks totally unnatural.</p></div></div></div></div>
