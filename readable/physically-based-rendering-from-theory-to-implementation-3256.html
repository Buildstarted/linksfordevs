<p>Photorealistic computer graphics is ubiquitous
today, with applications that include entertainment‚Äînotably, movies
and video games; product design; and architecture.  Over the past
decade, <em>physically-based</em> approaches to rendering have become
widely used, where an accurate modeling of the physics of light
scattering is at the heart of image synthesis.  These approaches offer both
visual realism and predictability.
</p>

<p><em>Physically Based Rendering</em> describes both
the mathematical theory behind a modern photorealistic rendering system as
well as its practical implementation. A method known as ‚Äúliterate
programming‚Äù combines human-readable documentation and source code into a
single reference that is specifically designed to aid comprehension. The
ideas and software in this book show the reader how to design and employ a
full-featured rendering system capable of creating stunning
imagery.</p>

<p>
The author team of Matt Pharr, Greg Humphreys, and Pat Hanrahan garnered a
2014 Academy Award for Scientific and Technical Achievement from the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences based on impact
the first and second editions of the book had on how movies are made. The Academy called
the book a ‚Äúwidely adopted practical roadmap for most physically based
shading and lighting systems used in film production.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
Of the book, Donald Knuth wrote ‚ÄúThis book has deservedly won an Academy
Award. I believe it should also be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
As of October 15, 2018, the full contents of the third edition of
the book are freely available online.
