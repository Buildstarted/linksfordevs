<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>University life is going to look very different this fall, and as faculty scramble to work social distancing into their “campus culture,” students will be left paying the price for a half-baked education. </p><p>With exceptions for science labs, fine arts studios and a few small tutorials — Ontario’s university courses will run online this fall, either asynchronously through pre-recorded lectures and Powerpoints or through the video conferencing app Zoom. And tuition fees won’t be going down a cent. </p><p>The schools claim that, despite these changes in delivery, they will still provide “exceptional education and engaging experiences” and the calibre of their courses will remain the same. But who are they kidding? </p><p>When classes suddenly switched online in late March, no one pretended the quality of instruction was the same as in the classroom. Students were told to be patient and understanding as their university and professors adjusted to this “new normal” — but now, months later, nothing has changed and universities must acknowledge students’ losses.</p><p>Students do not learn as effectively online <a oncontextmenu="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/mandatory-online-courses-ontario-high-school-students-terrible-idea-e-learning-1.5072018">as they do in-person</a>. </p><p>Online courses lack class discussions that are key to making courses engaging. Listening to a talking head on a screen may impart some knowledge, but it does nothing more to encourage students to engage with each other and the course content than final exams do.</p><p>Students lose their sense of classroom community in Zoom lectures. Gone are the days of casual study groups and staying after lecture to ask the professor a question; in an online classroom, everything has to be formalized and purposeful, and that makes it harder to reach out to each other. </p><p>Of course, this drop in the quality of education doesn’t mean students are going to be failing at an alarming rate next year; most professors will be lenient and curve grades so the majority of students can pass. And this is all fine if a student is going to university for the degree alone, but most students go to university to learn — and most students learn less online. </p><p>Tuition fees also pay for more than just classes: they pay for lecture halls so students have somewhere comfortable to learn and for libraries so students can study away from the distractions of home, something that won’t be an option this year.</p><p>Obviously, the solution isn’t for classes to be held in-person as young people are more likely to contract the virus and most tenured professors are in high risk groups for becoming seriously ill, making in-person lectures a perfect storm for catastrophic spread. </p><p>But universities need to stop pretending online courses will be the same quality as in-person, and they need to stop asking students to pay the full-service price tag. </p><p>For most students, deferring a semester is not an option — they’ve signed leases and know that travel and job prospects are slim — so they are forced to pay fees that in no way reflect the quality of education they’re getting.</p><p>Ten hours of staring at a laptop screen is not the same as 10 hours in a lecture hall — and students shouldn’t be paying tuition fees like it is. </p><div data-lpos="newsletter|get-the-latest-in-your-inbox"><h3>Get the latest in your inbox</h3><p>Never miss the latest news from the Star, including up-to-date coronavirus coverage, with our email newsletters</p><p><a href="https://www.thestar.com/emails.html?nsrc=article-inline-covid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign Up Now</a></p></div><div data-lpos="article|author|bottom"><p><strong>Hope Mahood</strong> is the co-ordinating editor of news and opinions for the Western Gazette.</p></div><div id="conversations"><p>JOIN THE CONVERSATION </p><div><p>Q:</p><p>Do you think students should have to pay full price for online classes? </p></div><div><p>Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be registered Torstar account holder.
