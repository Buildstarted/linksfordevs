If you would like to know which objects in a BVH might intersect some volume of interest, you can do an intersection test against a BVH node, and if that test fails, there is no need to perform tests against the children of that node, since their intersection tests are guaranteed to fail.</p><p>BVH has many nice properties and is commonly used in ray tracing and real-time computer graphics, such as in video games.</p><p>One property that BVH does not have, however, is that it is not possible to express a BVH as the ordering of objects in an array.</p><p>That is to say that, if you have an array of objects, and you wish to sort them for sublinear search, BVH can not do this, unless there is also an auxiliary data structure, other than the array of objects itself.</p><p>There is, however, a spatial data structure that can sort an array of objects for sublinear search without requiring any auxiliary data structure, and it is called Bounding Half-Space Hierarchy (BHH).</p><p>In other words, with BHH it is possible to “sort” a 1D array of 3D objects, “in 3D,” for efficient search “in 3D.”</p><h2><a id="user-content-half-space" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#half-space"><svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Half-Space</h2><p>A closed half-space is a plane plus all of the space on one side of the plane. A bounding box is the intersection of six half-spaces, and a bounding tetrahedron is the intersection of four. For any set of half-spaces whose intersection encloses space, and for any array of objects, if there is a function f that produces the minimum value occupied by the object in each half-space, then we can use BHH to sort the array of objects for sublinear search:</p><p>Let’s work in two dimensions, since it’s simpler and extends trivially to higher dimensions.</p><h2><a id="user-content-how-to-construct-a-bhh" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-construct-a-bhh"><svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>How to Construct a BHH</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/bryanmcnett/bhh/blob/master/images/triangles.png"><img src="/bryanmcnett/bhh/raw/master/images/triangles.png" alt="triangles"></a></p><p>Above we have an array of 15 triangle structures [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14] where each structure contains the three values {minX, minY, -(maxX+maxY)}.

the best possible spatial data structure,
as it uses no memory whatsoever.
By other metrics such as energy spent
vs work avoided, it is probably not as good
as BVH et al, partially by virtue of the fact
that an implicit BHH uses no memory.</p><hr><ul><li>As long as all semicircles contain at least one axis</li><li>Not exactly a dual polyhedron.
