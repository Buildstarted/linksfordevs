<p>Interesting,it is stenanography but it's not about hiding data in a fingerprint image.</p>

<p>Because the image is generated from the data then it is equivalent to encoding (png).</p>

<p>It could be useful if the image cannot be distinguished from a real fingerprint by simple means &amp; that the decoder produces valid decodings from real fingerprints.</p>

<p>Oh combine it with those "gummy bear" quick eat fingerprints, then there are possabilities ;-)</p>

<p>@ ALL,</p>

<p>Boing boing pointed out why least significant bit stego not only does not work very well but also is fragile with image compression software etc.</p>

<p>The paper author Li, noted however,</p>

<ul><i>We could still achieve relative high data extraction accuracy even if the constructed fingerprint image is binarized, thinned, or severely compressed</i></ul>

<p>After a few moments thought, I suspect the encoding algorithm actually plays to the strengths of image compression software.</p>

<p><br>
At that point, why rely upon steganography?</p>

<p>You could just encode binary data in an Aztec or QR code for your "fingerprint" - not exactly the most effective way to send a message but likely less error-prone than parsing with this implementation.</p>

<p>&gt; Can't see any real use for it, but that's okay.</p>

<p>Police agencies keeping hidden data on citizens?  But there are easier ways to do that.</p>

<p>I imagine this warrants an addition to the Bruce Schneier FAQ:</p>

<blockquote><b>Bruce Schneier's fingerprints steganographically encode his 2048-bit public RSA key.</b></blockquote>

<p>Well, here's one idea: PIV cards usually allow storing a fingerprint.  So perhaps I have a nice key that I'd like to be immune to border search, or surrender.  I encode my key in my fingerprint, then upload that to the PIV card (who's to say "Schneier Security" doesn't issue you a badge?)</p>

<p>Now I can sanitize my entire travel kit, yet when I reach the other side, I can copy those confidential business files from cloud storage to my laptop, extract the key from my PIV card, then decrypt the files I need.</p>

<p>Encrypt/upload those same files when complete, sanitize the laptop drive, and pass through all borders without a trace of your data.</p>

<p>(Obviously, the actual keys/certs on the PIV card should point to nothing important.)</p>

<p>No obvious use?<br>
If the technique is resistant to some error, it's a great way to communicate with police - like an undercover cop needing a covert channel to his bosses.  Just add a small "scar" to the print to allow the crime scene tech to ID messages of significance and pass along to the squad<br>

<p>How about encoding messages in the real fingerprint? Imagine a hacker who can break into any computer by scanning his fingers on a fingerprint reader. Or someone who carries national secrets encoded in her fingerprints, which she passes on by visiting a theme park where a confederate has corrupted the fingerprint readers.</p>

<p>Laser ablation should be able to do something along that line.</p>
