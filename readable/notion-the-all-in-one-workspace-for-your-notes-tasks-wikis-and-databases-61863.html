Notion remembers it all so you don’t have to.</p><p>Whether it’s to-do’s, a reminder, or your next big idea, Notion makes it easy to add and find later.</p></div><div><h3>Trip reviewer Ceci never forgets <br> a good idea at home</h3><p>An international travel blogger, Ceci’s notes need to go with her. Using an organized note-taking system in Notion, she keeps track of everything she’s supposed to record and review for her trips, while also capturing thoughts along the way.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Your budget, recipes, articles to read — instead of using multiple apps to corral this info, keep it all in one place.</p><p>In Notion, you can create a home base for the many things going on in your life, and build it to match the way your brain works.</p></div><div><h3>Human rights activist Amira keeps many plates spinning</h3><p>Amira, an entrepreneur and humanitarian, uses Notion to organize every facet of her life — the company she runs, global travel, and the Tunisian recipe book she’s writing with her mother.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/personal/people/swapna.png" alt="Swapna Krishna"></p><div><div><div><p>Managing any project — from work requests to a list of chores — is a juggling act. In Notion, you can get a full view of what needs to get done so no balls get dropped.</p><p>Make simple checklists or detailed project boards to turn tasks into action.</p></div><div><h3>Freelance writer Swapna keeps tabs <br> on all her assignments</h3><p>A space and science writer, Swapna usually works on several pieces at once, every week. With Notion, she’s able to build detailed lists of to-do’s for all projects while tracking the status of each one through her process.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>Get started. <span>free</span> for personal use.</p><div><div><p>For web, mobile, Mac &amp; Windows</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Just start typing in Notion and everything else fades away. We’ve designed it to help you focus on the task at hand.</p><p>Notion’s writing experience is as simple or sophisticated as you need it to be — it’s a home for distraction-free thinking where you can organize your thoughts with drag-and-drop ease.</p></div><div><h3>Startup founder Alex wrote <br> his first book in Notion</h3><p>As a CEO and co-founder, Alex spends a lot of time managing people. He wrote his first book on management in Notion, collecting hundreds of pages of thoughts, organizing them, and sharing them for feedback with dozens of collaborators.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/personal/people/alex.png" alt="Alex MacCaw"></p><div><div><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/personal/benefits/android-writing.png"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/personal/people/tommy.png" alt="Tommy Barav"></p><div><div><div><p>No matter how you want to improve, Notion is flexible enough help you achieve your goals.</p><p>Meal planners, reading lists, and habit trackers all live side-by-side — no more switching between apps to stay on target.</p></div><div><h3>Productivity expert Tommy built <br> a system for self-improvement</h3><p>Tommy is an entrepreneur who’s made getting things done his career. Using Notion, he built a fully-customized (and highly-quantified) system that helps him reach his goals, both personal and professional. And it’s all in one place for everyday use.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Reach the entire world by making any Notion page a publicly-accessible website with a single click.</p><p>A resume, portfolio, or personal website — publishing pages with Notion lets you express yourself and be discovered by everyone, anywhere.</p></div><div><h3>Engineer Anabella built her resume on the web for all to see</h3><p>Anabella is a software engineer with a love for visual design. Her resume is a public page in Notion, making it viewable to the many hiring managers out there browsing the web (and others who might share).</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><div><h2>Designed for you to get more done</h2><p>These features and more are now free — forever.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/shared/features/drag-and-drop-v2.gif"></p><h4>Think with drag &amp; drop</h4><p>Grab anything, move and organize it, however works best for you.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/shared/features/slash-command-overview.gif"></p><h4>Many types of content</h4><p>Images, videos, headings, app embeds — add anything right into Notion pages.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/shared/features/nested-sidebar-pages.gif"></p><h4>Clear navigation</h4><p>Nest pages inside of pages and view them all at a glance in your sidebar.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/shared/features/discussion.png"></p><h4>Collaborate in real time</h4><p>Comments and mentions help you get more done with other people, wherever you are.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><div><h2>Get going on web or desktop</h2><p>We also have iOS &amp; Android apps to match.</p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/shared/illustrations/team-features-illustration.png"></p><div><h2>Templates to get you started</h2><p>Access 50+ templates for free when you sign up.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><h2>Boost your personal productivity</h2><p>Use it free forever, or go Pro for more upload power.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/pricing/pricing-free-v2.png" alt="Personal"></p><p><h4>Personal</h4></p></div><p>free</p></div><div><div><p>Replaces</p><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/pricing/pricing-personal-replaces.png" alt="Replaces"></p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/pricing/pricing-personal-v2.png" alt="Personal Pro"></p><p><h4>Personal Pro</h4></p></div></div><div><div><p>Everything in Personal, plus</p><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><div><p>Replaces</p><p><img src="https://www.notion.so/front/pricing/pricing-pro-replaces.png" alt="Replaces"></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><h4>Using Notion at work?</h4><p>Learn more about using <a href="https://www.notion.so/work" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notion for work</a> or visit our <a href="https://www.notion.so/pricing" rel="noopener noreferrer">pricing page</a> to see our full list of team and enterprise features.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><div><p>I already had a free Notion account. What changed?</p><div><p>Our old Free Plan had a limit of 1,000 blocks of content. Now, you’re on our new free Personal Plan and can add as much content as you want!</p><p>We made a couple other changes, too:</p><ul><li>We made it simpler to share pages with collaborators. Instead of adding them as guests or members, just send them a link.</li><li>You can now invite up to five guests to collaborate privately with you on pages in your workspace. To invite more guests, you'll need to upgrade to our Personal Pro Plan.</li></ul><p>Learn more about all our plans at <a href="https://www.notion.so/pricing" rel="noopener noreferrer">notion.so/pricing</a>.</p></div><p>What if I'm already paying for the old Personal Plan?</p><div><p>You've been automatically upgraded to our new Personal Pro Plan at no extra cost! In addition to all the features of the free Personal Plan, Personal Pro includes:</p><ul><li>No limit on file uploads (5MB is the limit for free)</li><li>Unlimited guest collaborators (5 guests is the limit for free)</li><li>Version history up to 30 days</li><li>Priority customer support</li><li>API access (coming soon)</li></ul><p>You can switch back to the free Personal Plan at any time.</p></div><p>What happens to all the guests I added on the old Free Plan?</p><div><p>You can still add up to 5 guests to collaborate on any page in your workspace. If you've already added more than 5 guests, they will still be there. But to add more over the 5-guest limit, you’ll need to upgrade to the Personal Pro Plan.</p><p>That said, our new public editing feature makes it possible to allow any other Notion users with the page's link to add edits or comments.</p></div><p>What if I had multiple members in my free workspace?</p><div><p>No worries, you don’t have to remove anyone! Nothing is different for you until you hit 1,000 blocks of content. At that point, if you want to add more, you can:</p><ul><li>Upgrade to our Team Plan.</li><li>Start a new workspace for just yourself and use it for free, indefinitely.</li><li>Remove members, and enjoy no content limits on your own.</li></ul><p>Note: Make sure members in your workspace have their private pages backed up before you remove them!</p></div><p>How can my team try out Notion for free?</p><div><p>We want to make it easy for you to take Notion for a spin with multiple members before you start paying. Here’s how to do that:</p><ul><li>Create a new Notion workspace, and select Team as the type when asked.</li><li>You’ll be enrolled in a Team Plan free trial that gives you access to Team Plan features with a 1,000-block content limit. When you hit that limit, you can upgrade.</li></ul></div><p>What about free plans for students and educators?</p><div><p>Students and educators are eligible to get our new Personal Pro Plan for free (normally $5/month)! And those already on our Free Education plan have been upgraded automatically. In addition to all free features, this includes:</p><ul><li>Adding unlimited guest collaborators to any page</li><li>No limit on file uploads (5MB is the limit for free)</li><li>Version history up to 30 days</li><li>Priority customer support</li><li>API access (coming soon)</li><li>Learn more at <a href="https://www.notion.so/students" rel="noopener noreferrer">notion.so/students</a> or <a href="https://www.notion.so/educators" rel="noopener noreferrer">notion.so/educators</a></li></ul></div><p>Still have more questions?
