He was talking to the <a href="https://csdb.dk/group/?id=185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Excess crew</a> and they helped him to put the demo together for the x2018 party.</em>&nbsp;He says he had the idea to release the demo in a&nbsp;<g class="gr_ gr_178 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="178" data-gr-id="178">cartridge</g> but that wasn’t possible, therefore the&nbsp;<em>cracked&nbsp;</em>version.</p></blockquote><p>I’ve played Limbo on the XBOX and I can tell the C64 version plays exactly like the original. The grayscale palette works wonderfully and the animations are very detailed.</p><p>We are still trying to find out more about this release, and if it indicates the game is really in active development or this is the playable version developed by&nbsp;Søren a year ago. Meanwhile, you can try by yourself downloading it from the link below or watch my video playing it to the end (of the preview)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>Link: <a href="https://csdb.dk/release/index.php?id=170889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CSDb</a></p></figure></div></div></div></div>
