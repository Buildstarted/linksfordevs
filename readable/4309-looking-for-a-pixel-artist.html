It’s a modern fantasy RPG set during a road trip, following four queer losers as they fight across a countryside infested by the ancient Machine Devil.</strike></p><p><strike>The artist will be creating assets working closely with an existing concept artist (<a href="http://skeletonhouse.tumblr.com/">Isaac Robin, creator of Witch Trade!</a>) for everything, including character animations, monsters, environments, and dialogue portraits. The art style will need to be similar to SNES RPGs—think along the lines of Chrono Trigger. Since this is my first time branching out from visual novels, we’re specifically looking for someone with a lot of experience that can help us make decisions about scope.</strike></p><p><strike>This will be a paid job, and we’re looking for someone with availability starting in December. If you’re interested, please send an email containing a link to your portfolio and previous game experience to <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=mailto%3Achristine%40loveconquersallgames.com%3Fsubject%3DGET%2520IN%2520THE%2520CAR%2520PIXEL%2520ARTIST&amp;t=YmYxZjQxNDUzYTRmNzQ4NWY3OTBlNjAxZjJhYjEzODk1Nzk0N2ZhYixMQjBRczVGZA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A2GgkQLr25H3LizHutAMCdg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Floveconquersallgam.es%2Fpost%2F167054815658%2Flooking-for-a-pixel-artist&amp;m=1">christine@loveconquersallgames.com</a> with the subject line “GET IN THE CAR PIXEL ARTIST.”</strike></p><p><strike>Any RTs or reblogs would be appreciated.
