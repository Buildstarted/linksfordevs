We have reported the matter to the [UK's Information Commissioner's Office] ICO and are working to establish further facts around this situation. We will take any action necessary in line with our statutory obligations.”<span></span><span></span>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) had earlier said that at least 125 other organisations had been affected by the breach, including universities and charities. &nbsp;<span></span><span></span>A spokesperson from the ICO said: "Blackbaud has reported a data breach incident which has potentially affected a large number of UK organisations using its services and we are making enquiries.”<span></span><span></span>"Organisations involved should be getting in touch with their customers to inform them if their personal data has been impacted."<span></span><span></span>Blackbaud, which provides a customer relationship management system for the party, was hit by a ransomware attack in May 2020.<span></span><span></span>The organisation reportedly paid a ransom and has "received assurances from the cybercriminal that the data had been destroyed". &nbsp;</p><hr data-testid="horizontal-rule"></div></div></div>
