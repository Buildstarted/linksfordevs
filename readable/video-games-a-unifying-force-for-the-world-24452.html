		<p>My father, a chemical engineer, brought home our first computer, a Sinclair ZX81, which came out in 1981. We played games together and then later, we wrote games together.</p>
<p>Today, for many people around the world, gaming is the first entry point into technology, just like it was for me.</p>
<p>I believe in two fundamental truths about gaming:</p>
<p><strong>First, gaming is for everyone.</strong> No one group “owns” gaming. Instead, whether you’re new to gaming or are a diehard esports fan, you are welcome to play and welcome to all the fun and skill-building that comes with gaming. In this way, when everyone can play, the entire world wins.</p>
<p>If you imagine gamers as predominantly men and specifically teen boys, think again. We are a 2.6 billion-person strong community of parents playing with our kids, adventurers exploring worlds together, teachers making math wondrous, grandmothers learning about their grandchildren through play, and soldiers connecting with their folks back home. Most gamers today are adults; nearly half are women.</p>
<p><strong>Second, gaming must promote and protect the safety of all.</strong> Gaming must be a safe environment. Creating community is shared work, and protecting community is essential work, so, we all carry part of the payload of community safety – game industry and gamers alike.</p>
<p>This widespread embrace of gaming and its global communities have turned video games into the world’s <a href="http://www.karsenti.ca/minecraft/files_files/Minecraft_Research_Reports_Karsenti_2017.pdf">leading cultural industry</a>, bigger than <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/%20heat-vision/why-arent-video-games-as-respected-as-movies-1067314">movies</a> or music. But it also comes at a time when digital life includes a growing toxic stew of hate speech, bigotry and misogyny.</p>
<p>No different from rock and roll, books and TV before them, video games are often dismissed or maligned as frivolous, fraught with violence or filled exclusively with hate-mongering. But gaming is uniquely designed for equality. We don’t just walk in someone’s shoes – we stand on equal footing, regardless of age, education, socioeconomics, race, religion, politics, gender, orientation, ethnicity, nationality, or ability. Gaming doesn’t just bring stereotype-defying gamers together; it unites us through our universal language of fun and answers our human need to play. Research has shown an effective way to battle polarization and prejudice is through relationships with people outside our own groups, known as <a href="http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/genderandsexualitylawblog/files/2012/04/A-Meta-Analytic-Test-of-Intergroup-Contact-Theory.pdf">intergroup contact theory</a>. This is where gaming excels: forging unexpected friendships with people we might never meet in real life. Dr. Linda Tropp, a professor of psychology at University of Massachusetts Amherst, observes, “As an interactive form of entertainment, gaming environments have the potential to bring people together for collaborations across differences, and to build empathy and mutual understanding through play.”</p>
<p>When people call video games a waste a time, I point them to the well-documented health and social benefits of gaming. Beyond pure exhilaration, gaming helps children with autism <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030713-100-how-is-helping-children-with-autism-make-new-friends/">make new friends</a> and seniors with Alzheimer’s <a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/research-suggests-active-gaming-benefits-brain-health/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIx6WcqY_s4QIVS_lRCh0VqwdjEAAYASAAEgLuiPD_BwE">improve their memory</a>. Researchers have found that gaming teaches adults <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2010/07/19/career-leadership-strategy-technology-videogames.html#50a4d14f3363">leadership</a>, improves <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/466852/7-health-benefits-playing-video-games">decision-making and reduces stress and depression</a> and also teaches <a href="http://www.gettingsmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/How-Minecraft-Supports-SEL.pdf">kids computational skills and empathy</a>. Gaming is the gateway to these 21<sup>st</sup> century skills and to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). Just consider: teen girls who play video games are three times more likely to pursue a <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90253976/girl-gamers-are-more-likely-to-study-science-and-tech">STEM degree</a>. Among teenagers who play games online with others daily, <a href="https://www.pewinternet.org/2015/08/06/chapter-1-meeting-hanging-out-and-staying-in-touch-the-role-of-digital-technology-in-teen-friendships/">74% have made friends online and 37% have made more than five friends online.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>By uniting as an industry, we can thoughtfully and deliberately continue building a safe and inclusive gaming environment for everyone. Microsoft, Team Xbox, and I are personally committing to this, beginning with the following principles and actions:</p>
<p><strong><em>We commit to be vigilant, proactive, and swift. </em></strong><em>Our Xbox Safety team is nicknamed the “Defenders of Joy” because we will defend you in every humanly and technologically possible way, so gaming remains fun. We will identify potentials for abuse and misuse on our platform and will fix problems quickly. We are also intent on expanding the composition of our safety team so wide-ranging perspectives can help us identify future safety problems and solutions</em><em>. Because hate and harassment have no place in gaming, we recently published a refreshed version of our <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/Legal/Community-Standards">Xbox Community Standards</a> to communicate how each of us can keep gaming fun and safe for all and detail the consequences when any of us break these standards. A welcoming community is the key to a safe community, so our 150,000 <a href="https://ambassadors.microsoft.com/xbox">Xbox Ambassadors</a> – community leaders, stewards, and allies – will be engaged to embark on new community missions to help create an inviting and safe environment for all gamers. We will also continue to roll out new programs for the health of our entire gaming community. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>We commit to empowering you to safeguard your gaming experience the way you want.</em></strong><em> We believe in equipping you with the tools to customize your gaming experience fit for your personal comfort level. This summer, we are empowering our official Club community managers with proactive content moderation features that will help create safe spaces for fans to discuss their favorite games. We plan to roll out new content moderation experiences to everyone on Xbox Live by the end of 2019. </em><em><a href="http://family.microsoft.com/?ref=nyt">Creating a Child or Teen Account</a></em><em> is the easiest way for parents and guardians to manage who their kids engage with as well as their family’s screen time, content and spending. While more than 26 million Child and Teen accounts have been created to-date, we will make it easier for parents and guardians new to console and PC gaming to discover and create Child or Teen accounts. This year, Microsoft Stores rolled out a series of family workshops to help parents understand the tools available to them on console and PC, and this summer we are launching Gaming Summer Camps offering young gamers new ways to explore life skills and practice healthy habits that can be used in gaming and everyday life. Additionally, we recently launched a new “For Everyone” destination on </em><em><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/for-everyone">Xbox.com</a></em><em> where parents, guardians and players can learn how we’re making gaming more fun for everyone with our new </em><em><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/">inclusivity</a></em><em>, </em><em><a href="https://www.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessibility">accessibility</a></em><em>, and </em><em><a href="https://www.xbox.com/for-everyone/responsible-gaming">safety features</a></em><em>. </em><em>We’re innovating now in these and other concrete ways to reduce, filter, and develop a shared understanding of toxic experiences, and to ultimately put our community of gamers, and their parents or guardians, in control of their own experiences.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>We commit to working across the gaming industry on safety measures.</em></strong><em> Because we intend to protect all gamers, we will openly share safety innovations with our industry the same way Microsoft has made </em><em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna">PhotoDNA</a></em><em> technology universally available to everyone from the police to the tech industry to fight the spread of child pornography. </em><em>Today, </em><em>multiple teams working in areas like moderation, user research, data science, and others are already aligning with industry partners to share insights, and best practices in areas of safety, security and privacy.</em></p>
<p>The gaming community continues to grow rapidly, and the imminent roll-out of new game services such as Apple Arcade, Google Stadia and Microsoft’s Project xCloud, will make gaming available to even more people worldwide. Our industry must now answer the fierce urgency to play with our fierce urgency for safety.</p>
<p>We invite everyone who plays games, and industry partners, to join us in following these principles to help unify the world and do our part: make gaming accessible for everyone and protect gamers, one and all.</p>
