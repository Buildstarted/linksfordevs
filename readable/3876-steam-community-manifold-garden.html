However, it was a pretty significant update and initially broke several other visual effects. It took a while to track down all the issues, but the good news is we’ve fixed them now and the current system is overall better than it was before. </p><p><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/25877428/4c44a0a05aba83ec8c67063fdcc726bee20b72a4.png"><b>Black Hole Particle Improvements</b></p><p>Besides shadows, another element we improved is the look of these black hole boxes. In the game, they represent a kind of corruption. However, they were breaking the world wrapping illusion:</p><p>https://i.imgur.com/YJuArCw.gif</p><p>To achieve the world wrapping effect in Manifold Garden, we place duplicate versions of the world around the main one. <br>The play area is defined as a box. When the player reaches one face of the box, we teleport them to the other side. It’s simple in theory, but the key is you have to make it look seamless. </p><p><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/25877428/df2b5cc774f2493db786176346902253aafac660.gif">The reason for the black holes popping in visually was that they did not have fog applied, so they didn't transition smoothly like everything else. We added fog, but the problem here is that material colors fade out before the edges do. While the fog applies to the material, it does not apply to the edges. </p><p>The problem with this, however, is that having the black hole boxes fade out early looks weird. They’re supposed to represent corruption. It’s supposed to be the darkest material in the world, but they don’t look that way. </p><p><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/25877428/1c655c47b45d26aa932fb7a8f308cc38ec51ccb4.png">Arthur, who’s been the main architect for the graphics system, ended up applying a different fade to the black hole material. Now it actually fades out even slower then the lines. It’s very subtle, but in the distance, they appear slightly darker than the edges. It’s as if they’re darker than black.</p><p><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/25877428/74eca35e08ba7d63bfccef0ec3e5ef0d3431453d.png"><b><br>Music System</b></p><p>The new music system is better explained in the video, as you can hear what we're working on. </p><p>We recently redid the music system in Manifold Garden to make it more flexible and modular. The old system was very limited in functionality and the code was quite messy, which made it difficult to make changes and add new music. Customization used to take hours, whereas now it takes minutes. </p><p>The new system has each area’s behaviour separated into their own managers, which makes everything a lot more organized. All of these managers extend from a single base class called “MusicTrackerGroup”. This class is a group of music trackers. Each MusicTracker is responsible for managing a single FMOD sound event for the music, and how fade in and out that sound, how to manage FMOD parameters, and saving or loading data from the save file as needed. </p><p>We have a default behaviour for music that we can use if a level doesn’t need any customization. If a piece of music is assigned to a level and uses the default behaviour, then when the player enters the scene, it fades out the last music and starts to fade in the new one, with a bit of overlap. It works fine, but we actually try not to use this default behaviour too much. The reason is that while the game space is broken down into scenes (for management purposes), we to want the players to experience the world as being seamless. The spaces connect to each other, so it wouldn’t make sense if every time you were in another room, a different music played. </p><p>Internally, we have this idea of "music sentences", where a piece of music might begin in one scene, and then continue throughout others, creating and enforcing a sense of connection between the spaces. </p><p>_______________________________________</p><p>Anyway, lots of places to stay up to date.
