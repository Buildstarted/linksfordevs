<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Modified Nov 8, 2019</span></p><p>Good common-sense reporting tool, but from the ratings here, people obviously don't grok the 5k top sites heuristic and the colored flag (this is a bad UI in my opinion). 

Chrome already has a built-in detection for sites that are malicious, called Google Safe Browsing, but it's not perfect. This plugin tries to fix the cases where Chrome doesn't detect a site that you know (or suspect) is malicious, and you can report it efficiently in to their system so it will be added.

If you look at this extension from the use case of "I landed on a suspicious site and I would like to let Google know about it," then its design makes sense. If you are thinking to report a site that's not in the Top 5k visited sites, it says clearly:

Report site to Google
What should be considered about this site
    Site not in top 5k sites

To me, I understand this as "Before you report this site, be aware..."

If you look at this extension as a diagnostic tool to tell you if a site is safe or not, then yes, it makes no sense to flag anything as orange if it's not in the top 5k. However, as I said before, the tool is a reporting tool, to be used once you already suspect a site that Google didn't already warn you about.

It's anecdotal, but I reported a Phishing site using this plugin and it was almost immediately detected by Google Safe Browsing (when I tried to reload the page) and the site itself was down within 15 minutes. It could be a coincidence, since probably others reported it, too.</p></div></div></div>
