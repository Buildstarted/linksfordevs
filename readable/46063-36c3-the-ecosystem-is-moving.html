    <h1>[36C3] The ecosystem is moving</h1>
    <p>You are blocking Javascript, and we totally get that. However this endpoint uses Angular, so the front end is in full JavaScript and won&apos;t work without it. There will be other non JS-based clients to access PeerTube, but for now none is available. Be sure we will update this page with a list once alternative clients are developed. You can certainly develop you own in the meantime as our code is open source and libre software under GNU AGPLv3.0. <p> There might be numerous reasons you refuse to use JavaScript. If it has just to do with security (or lack thereof) of JavaScript-based webapps, then depending on your threat menace you might want to go through the code running on the node you are trying to access, and look for security audits. </p></p>
