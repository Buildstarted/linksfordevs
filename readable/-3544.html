<p><i>Continued from the <a href="https://adventuregamers.com/articles/view/36893/page">previous page</a>...</i></p><h2><strong><span>Best Non-Traditional Adventure:</span> Return of the Obra Dinn</strong></h2>
<p><br>
Weâ€™ve already established that <i>Return of the Obra Dinn</i> is one of the best detective games ever made, but itâ€™s all the more impressive because it eschews nearly every element of a typical adventure game in doing so. Inventory puzzles? Nope. Environmental puzzles? Nada. Character interaction? With whom? Theyâ€™re all dead! But who needs the standard genre trappings when youâ€™ve got a ship full of horrific death and pixelized gore? With its single-minded focus on identifying the dead crew of the Obra Dinn (and the methods by which they met their ends), this is a uniquely compelling experience that takes place primarily between the playerâ€™s ears in piecing together the gameâ€™s one giant logic puzzle.</p>

<p>Not content merely to defy expectations about gameplay, however, indie deloper Lucas Pope has done a marvelous job bringing the ship to life (and death) in a stunning lo-fi, monochromatic style that recalls â€˜80s MacVenture games like <i>DÃ©jÃ  vu</i> and <i>Shadowgate</i>, only thrust into the 3D era.&nbsp;Yet that deceptively simple visual approach belies a wealth of detail.&nbsp;Each frozen tableau of a characterâ€™s moment of death is deliciously complex, morbid, and often hilarious. This is a game that requires you to pay close attention to everything from the decorations on a sailorâ€™s hammock, to the tattoos on their arms, to minor differences in accent and hairstyle. The package is topped off with a tragi-comically jaunty soundtrack, great voice acting, and atmospheric sound design. And the feeling of checking off another batch of names on your list of doom? Second to none. <i>Return of the Obra Dinn</i> is simply one of the most unorthodox but rewarding games of the year, and for that itâ€™s the runaway Aggie winner for Best Non-Traditional Adventure.</p>

Wait, no, thatâ€™s <i>Clue</i>. But when you think about it, <i>Return of the Obra Dinn</i> is a lot like Hasbroâ€™s enduring board game â€“ only instead of cards and dice, you have to really use your brain to piece together victim, cause of death, and murderer (if any). Sixty victims, that is â€“ sixty!! There are no conventional puzzles to solve per se, because the entire mystery is one huge interwoven logic conundrum to crack, and itâ€™ll take diligence and careful observation (and fess up â€“ a little bit of guesswork as well) to succeed. It may look like a 1-bit game straight out of the 1980s, but itâ€™s surprisingly effective in action, and itâ€™s backed by a terrific soundscape throughout. Take a look at a screenshot and you might be tempted to dismiss it; take some time to play for a while and youâ€™ll be hooked. Staff and readers are in accord: Lucas Pope has crafted a winner.</p>
