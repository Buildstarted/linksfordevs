											<h3>About this Session</h3>
											<div>
												
<p>The protection of a user's personal information is a fundamental right, that job will be done by data engineers teams, right? They should protect a billion of data structures. It sounds tedious! How can we do that providing a high performance, maintainable and testable code and in a reasonable time?</p>
<p>Don't worry, Matryoshka is a framework that makes it possible to browse your data structures using recursion schemes, and if you use it with low-level Spark, you get the best of both worlds. Join us and we'll show you how we did it!</p>
<h3>Required Knowledge</h3>
<p>You should be familiar with basic Scala and Spark, some high level functional programming experience can be useful but our goal is to guide you step by step.</p>
