<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-body"><div><p>I got a $70 iPhone SE and upgraded the battery with a nominal 2180 mAh one (the original had 1624 mAh of capacity). Then I added Qi wireless charging with an adhesive tag that lives between the case and the phone's back chassis (connected via the Lightning port).</p>

<p>How about performance? After a few cycles and tests running iOS 13.5.1, the 2016 SE effectively streamed YouTube videos for 12 consecutive hours, at max brightness. I'm very happy and hardly miss the iPhone X (swipe gestures would be nice, and the OLED display maybe). The surprise was how well it handles iOS 13, plus rediscovering the form factor: easier to handle and to grip on. When I bend to tie my shoes, it doesn't perforate my rib cage from the pocket like a Pro Max would. I also found that, in my case, the SE complements the iPad Pro 12.9‚Äù fantastically (aesthetics and screen size balance between iOS devices).</p>

<p>Adding Qi wireless for charging was easy and, so far, stable: I did not notice any qualitative speed changes from the iPhone X's charging behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Total investment: ~$98</strong>. The best part? I can plug in my IEM monitor headphones through the 3.5mm headphone jack, while this thing also supports AirPods/Pro (minus sharing audio with friends for simultaneous listening, but I didn't even know that was a feature...).</p>

<p>I upgraded to every new iteration of the iPhone from the original 2007 model up to the X. After that, I became more mindful of the added value I received from the investment, and the way I use the device itself has changed.</p>

<p>After the X abandoned me, I thought I'd wait for the smaller iPhone 12 to be released. It looks like I might keep this modded original SE longer than I intended to. I wonder how many other people also slowed down their upgrade cycle during the past few years (and why).</p>
