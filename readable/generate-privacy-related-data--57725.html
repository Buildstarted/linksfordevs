	<br><strong>12 February 2020</strong></p>

<p>Last week we became aware that an unidentified third party gained unauthorised access to our website’s online application system between 29 December 2019 and 27 January 2020 and was able to capture the personal information of some of our members.</p>

<p>While this is a serious matter, it’s important that we emphasise that this incident in no way compromised our members’ savings, as these are held by Public Trust in a completely different system.</p>

<p>As soon as we became aware of the incident, we took immediate steps to further strengthen security of our online applications website and wider IT systems. Our next immediate focus was to identify which of our members’ data was accessed and exactly what data was involved. This enables us to provide clear and accurate information to each member. All Generate members should now have received an email which informs them whether or not their data has been accessed, and provides information on further steps that affected members can take in response to this incident. In addition, we have been working closely with external cyber security specialists to fully investigate the circumstances of this incident and advise us on any further steps we should take.</p>

<p>We have also notified the Privacy Commissioner, the Financial Markets Authority, Inland Revenue and reported the incident to the New Zealand Police.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an organisation, we take the protection of our members’ data very seriously. Unfortunately, malicious attacks of this nature are becoming more common globally. In response to this incident, we have already taken a number of actions to further strengthen our security, and are implementing an ongoing programme of testing and refinement of our systems. Notwithstanding this, we sincerely apologise to our members who have been affected. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Please see below some FAQs for further important information.
	<br><em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q1: Have I been affected?</strong></p>

<p>A:&nbsp;If you are a Generate member, you should have received an email that clearly states whether or not your personal information was accessed. You can also safely log in to your account for specific information on what personal data of yours was accessed. If you have not received an email from us, or you still have questions, please call 0800 086 086 to speak with our team.</p>

<p><strong>Q2: How many people have been affected?</strong></p>

<p>A: Approximately 26,000 of the 90,000 clients that have joined Generate over the last 7 years have had personal information accessed illegitimately.</p>

<p><strong>Q2: What kind of personal information was accessed?</strong></p>

<p>A: Solely information that is held in our online application database has potentially been compromised. Investment data is held in a completely separate system and was not affected. Members whose data was affected should have received an email outlining what types of information was involved. They can also safely log in to their Generate account to see specifically what information of theirs was accessed.</p>

<p><strong>Q3: Has my password to my Generate online account been copied?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>A: No – your password has not been compromised.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q4. Are my savings safe with Generate?</strong></p>

<p>A. Yes, your savings are safe. They are held in a separate system to the one that was accessed. Your funds are held by a custodian - Public Trust - which is a Crown entity that has been looking after the interests of New Zealanders since 1873.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q5. How do I minimise the risks from identity theft?</strong></p>

<p>A. You should consider taking the following steps to further protect yourself:</p>

<ul>
	<li>change passwords for online services and make the passwords very difficult to guess;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>closely monitor bank account and credit card accounts for any suspicious transactions;</li>
	<li>contact bank or card issuers straight away if you notice any suspicious activity or unusual payments that you do not recognise;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Notify the credit agencies and register to receive alerts informing you if anyone tries to obtain credit in your name. &nbsp;Information on how to do this can be found here <a href="https://www.idcare.org/fact-sheets/suppressions-new-zealand">Credit suppression</a> and here <a href="https://www.idcare.org/fact-sheets/credit-reports-new-zealand">Credit Reports</a>.

<p><strong>Q6. If someone has copied my ID document(s) could they have withdrawn my money from Generate?</strong></p>

<p>A. While a fraudulent application for withdrawal could have been made using illegitimately obtained personal information, there is no evidence this has occurred. &nbsp;Furthermore, additional security measures have been put in place to prevent this from happening.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q7. Why does Generate hold this much personal information about its members?</strong></p>

<p>A. It is a legal requirement under New Zealand’s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism and KiwiSaver regimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Q8. How do I know this will not happen again?</strong></p>

<p>A. Unfortunately, malicious attacks of this nature are becoming more common globally. In response to this incident, we have already taken a number of actions to further strengthen our security, and are also working with leading cyber security specialists to ensure rigorous, ongoing programme of testing and enhancement of our systems to further minimise risk.</p>

<p><strong>Q9.&nbsp;</strong><strong>I haven’t received an email about this yet, how do I know if I’m affected?</strong></p>

<p>A. We emailed all members yesterday but are aware some emails have gone to spam or the email address we have is no longer current. Generate proactively contacted the media about this incident and posted on social media so that anyone who didn’t receive this email, could find out about this incident, contact us or log in to their online account to find out whether they have been affected. You can log in to your member account at <a href="http://www.generatewealth.co.nz/">www.generatewealth.co.nz</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q10. I want to extend my credit suppression for longer than 10 days, what is the police reference number?</strong></p>

<p>A. The police reference number is 200207/0175.</p>
