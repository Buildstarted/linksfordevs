          <p>You can't submarine consent to telemetry using an app or an update when the terms of the GDPR are applied. Here's why:</p>
<p>Using a Microsoft account to login to Windows 10 means that the product (and Microsoft) has access to personally identifiable information about the user.<br>
This personally identifiable user must be offered the opportunity to opt out of any and all personally identifiable data collection, must be allowed a copy of any and all collected data upon request and must also not be opted in by default to any personally identifiable data collection. This is the GDPR and you know this.</p>
<p>Anonymous information collection is something that this particular case cannot claim to be due to the fact that the login account is an <strong>identity</strong>. An identity Microsoft already has a copy of. The same identity which is used to <strong>identify</strong> the user when they login via their Microsoft account.</p>
<p>This means that <strong>the data is explicitly not anonymous</strong>.</p>
<p>If the user has agreed to the EULA for Windows 10 (and therefore agreed to telemetry at that particular point in time) the agreement concerns the software at that particular point in time and only Windows 10. It does not cover an application installed at a later date. Nor does it cover a software app store or an app installed from said store. This is particularly applicable to software which is not required to run the operating system. The EULA covers only the core of the operating system (which was installed onto the machine at the time the EULA was agree to.) And only that.<br>
If data collection is being made via an app store, consent to do so must also be separately sought when a personally identifiable user is involved.</p>
<p>This means that an update or an app cannot be installed into a personally identifiable user's account that enables data collection without them first explicitly agreeing to it. Doing so is a dark pattern referred to as 'submarine-ing consent.'</p>
<p>Aside from this, telemetry in Windows 10 must also be opt out by default in compliance with the GDPR due to the fact that a logged in Microsoft account holds personally identifiable information. The EULA is a contract between the individual and Microsoft. It is only enforceable against the individual if Microsoft knows their identity.</p>
<p>Be careful too. A person agreeing to a long and obfuscated EULA is no agreement between the two parties to waiver the default opt out. The GDPR also covers this too.</p>
