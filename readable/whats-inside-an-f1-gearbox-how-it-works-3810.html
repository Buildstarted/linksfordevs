            In this video, I open up an F1 gearbox to find out what's inside and explain a little about how it works.

I used to work on race cars many years ago, but it's been a while since I worked on any part of any car, let alone a Formula One car gearbox - as you can probably see in this video.

Anyway, it was a lot of fun to take this apart and see what's inside.

Thanks to Mansell Motorsport for allowing me to take this apart (and for them to put it back together!)
