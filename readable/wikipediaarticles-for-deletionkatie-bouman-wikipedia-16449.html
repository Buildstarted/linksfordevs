The Event Horizon Telescope project is notable in itself, and has its own article, but anyone who are in some way (remotely) associated with it are not inherently notable. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_is_not_inherited" title="Wikipedia:Notability is not inherited">Wikipedia:Notability is not inherited</a>. The article presents no proof of any independent notability, or any accomplishments she is personally credited with. Someone who isn't even an assistant professor is certainly not notable as a scientist. Otherwise this is a clear case of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:1E" title="Wikipedia:1E">WP:1E</a>. At most this merits a redirect to Event Horizon Telescope.

</p>
<ul><li>Just to confirm, Bouman's not right for Wikipedia because she "is certainly not notable as a scientist", but you thought a cat called Brexit warranted its own entry? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brexit_(cat)&amp;action=history">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brexit_(cat)&amp;action=history</a> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jesswade88" title="User:Jesswade88">Jesswade88</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jesswade88" title="User talk:Jesswade88">talk</a>) 20:47, 12 April 2019 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> there are many reliable sources providing significant coverage of her personally. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Natureium" title="User:Natureium">Natureium</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Natureium" title="User talk:Natureium">talk</a>) 19:44, 12 April 2019 (UTC)
<ul><li>As I said, only in the context of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:1E" title="Wikipedia:1E">WP:1E</a>, and she isn't actually credited with any notable accomplishments herself. There is an article on the event, which is where this content belongs. --<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tataral" title="User:Tataral">Tataral</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tataral" title="User talk:Tataral">talk</a>) 19:46, 12 April 2019 (UTC)
<ul><li>These are guidelines, not policy, and based on the amount of publicity she's receiving, I see no reason why Wikipedia shouldn't have a well-sourced article on her. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Natureium" title="User:Natureium">Natureium</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Natureium" title="User talk:Natureium">talk</a>) 19:48, 12 April 2019 (UTC)
<ul><li>Per <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:1E" title="Wikipedia:1E">WP:1E</a>, "the individual's role within [the event] should [...] be considered" and "the general rule is to cover the event, not the person". Only if "the event is highly significant, and the individual's role within it is a large one, a separate article is generally appropriate." There were at least 200 people with comparable roles and dozens of people with much more notable roles in this event. It's not a good idea to create biographies on obscure postdocs who played very small and junior roles in the event. --<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tataral" title="User:Tataral">Tataral</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tataral" title="User talk:Tataral">talk</a>) 19:52, 12 April 2019 (UTC)
<ul><li>She's about to start a position as Assistant Professor at CalTech. She's been featured in almost all coverage of the black hole image. She is most certainly not an 'obscure postdoc'. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jesswade88" title="User:Jesswade88">Jesswade88</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jesswade88" title="User talk:Jesswade88">talk</a>) 20:27, 12 April 2019 (UTC)
<ul><li>Don't you think that this position is a consequence of this mediatic coverage? I don't support deletion of the article, but the importance of the mediatic coverage and her implication in the M*87 black hole should be explicit as “member of a collaboration of 200 researchers”. Who got a wp page from the proof of Higgs' boson? <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chouhartem" title="User:Chouhartem">Chouhartem</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chouhartem&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Chouhartem (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:40, 12 April 2019 (UTC)
<ul><li>I'm not sure you're saying what I think you are, but no, her tenured position at CalTech was announced before the media frenzy this week. I'm not really concerned who "got a wp page from the proof of Higgs' boson?", but I'm sure heaps of people did. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jesswade88" title="User:Jesswade88">Jesswade88</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jesswade88" title="User talk:Jesswade88">talk</a>) 20:45, 12 April 2019 (UTC)
<ul><li>Where do the sources say that she is tenured? She may be on the tenure track at a prestigious university, but that alone doesn't satisfy <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NACADEMIC" title="Wikipedia:NACADEMIC">WP:NACADEMIC</a>. I know I'm going against the tide here, but I don't see the policy basis for keeping this page. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Wikieditor19920" title="User:Wikieditor19920">Wikieditor19920</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Wikieditor19920" title="User talk:Wikieditor19920">talk</a>) 20:54, 12 April 2019 (UTC)</li>
<li>Tenured at 29? I’m skeptical. Something like that would almost be worth an article itself. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Natureium" title="User:Natureium">Natureium</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Natureium" title="User talk:Natureium">talk</a>) 20:59, 12 April 2019 (UTC)
<ul><li>I was (quite clearly) responding to the comment that she is an 'obscure postdoc'. My 'vote' is below. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jesswade88" title="User:Jesswade88">Jesswade88</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jesswade88" title="User talk:Jesswade88">talk</a>) 21:01, 12 April 2019 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There's now tons of in-depth coverage specifically about her, making it very difficult to take claims of not passing GNG in good faith; the only possible issue is BIO1E. And the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/12/trolls-hijacked-scientists-image-attack-katie-bouman-they-picked-wrong-astrophysicist/">Washington Post story</a> shifts gears from her role in the black hole image to online trolling focused around her, making this more than just about a single event. —<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:David_Eppstein" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:David_Eppstein" title="User talk:David Eppstein">talk</a>) 20:17, 12 April 2019 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (I made the article). She is obviously notable enough to have a profile on here. In the past 48 hours Bouman has probably been covered in the news in every country in the world. The bio has been translated into almost 20 languages and was viewed over 30,000 times yesterday alone. Her TED talk (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/katie_bouman_what_does_a_black_hole_look_like?language=en">https://www.ted.com/talks/katie_bouman_what_does_a_black_hole_look_like?language=en</a>) has received almost 3 million views. Her story *should* be on Wikipedia. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jesswade88" title="User:Jesswade88">Jesswade88</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jesswade88" title="User talk:Jesswade88">talk</a>) 20:18, 12 April 2019 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and adjust her article to reflect the analysis—in reputable secondary sources—about how the media singled her out as the "hero". <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Heaviside_glow" title="User:Heaviside glow">Heaviside glow</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Heaviside_glow" title="User talk:Heaviside glow">talk</a>) 20:28, 12 April 2019 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the subject meets criterion 7 under NACADEMIC due to the press coverage of the subject's work.  Any argument that the press should not have covered her work is original research (at best) and should not be taken into account.<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Spope3&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Spope3 (page does not exist)">Spope3</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Spope3" title="User talk:Spope3">talk</a>) 20:30, 12 April 2019 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per WP:1E. Prominent coverage is primarily due to a facebook photo that went viral. --<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mu301" title="User:Mu301">mikeu</a> <sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mu301" title="User talk:Mu301">talk</a></sup> 20:30, 12 April 2019 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Almost all Caltech professors have in some way been revolutionary in their fields, so this is good indication that the Bouman article is notable. (This article is much better than many others about non-notable academics!) If keep votes keep winning, I suggest <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SNOW" title="Wikipedia:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:OtterAM" title="User:OtterAM">OtterAM</a> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:OtterAM" title="User talk:OtterAM">talk</a>) 20:33, 12 April 2019 (UTC)</li>
