<p>ASP.NET Core has an extensive authorization system that you can use to create complex authorization policies. In this post, I look at the various ways you can apply these policies to large sections of your application. </p>

<p>We'll start by configuring a global <code>AuthorizeFilter</code> and see why that's no longer the recommended approach in ASP.NET Core 3.0+. We'll then look at the alternative, using endpoint routing, as well as using Razor Page conventions to apply different authorization policies to different parts of your app. We'll also compare the <em>DefaultPolicy</em> to the <em>FallbackPolicy</em> see when each of them are applied, and how you can update them.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post, I'll assume you have a standard Razor Pages application, with a <em>Startup.cs</em> something like the following. The details of this aren't very important, I just assume you have already configured authentication and a UI system for your application.</p>

        <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you have authentication, and you want to start protecting your application. You could apply <code>[Authorize]</code> attributes to every Razor Page, but you want to be a bit safer, and apply authorization globally, to all the pages in your application. For the rest of this post, we look at the various options available.</p>

<p>The first option is to apply an <code>AuthorizeFilter</code> globally to all your MVC actions and Razor Pages. This is the approach traditionally used in earlier versions of ASP.NET Core. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30#authorization">this is not the recommend approach to apply authorization globally in ASP.NET Core 3.0+</a>. You'll see other approaches later in the post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, you can add an <code>AuthorizeFilter</code> to all your Razor Page actions when configuring your Razor Pages in <code>ConfigureServices</code> (you can configure MVC controllers in a similar way):</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    

    
    services<span>.</span><span>AddRazorPages</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>AddMvcOptions</span><span>(</span>options <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> options<span>.</span>Filters<span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>AuthorizeFilter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This is equivalent to decorating all your Razor Pages with an <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute, so users are authorized using the <code>DefaultPolicy</code> (more on that shortly!), which by default just requires an authenticated user. If you're not authenticated, you'll be redirected to the login page for Razor Pages apps (you'll receive a <code>401</code> response for APIs). </p>
<p>If you want to apply a different policy, you can specify one in the constructor of the <code>AuthorizeFilter</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    

    
    services<span>.</span><span>AddRazorPages</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>AddMvcOptions</span><span>(</span>options <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> options<span>.</span>Filters<span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>AuthorizeFilter</span><span>(</span><span>"MyCustomPolicy"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    services<span>.</span><span>AddAuthorization</span><span>(</span>options <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        options<span>.</span><span>AddPolicy</span><span>(</span><span>"MyCustomPolicy"</span><span>,</span>
            policyBuilder <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> policyBuilder<span>.</span><span>RequireClaim</span><span>(</span><span>"SomeClaim"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The authorization filter is still applied globally, so users will always be required to login, but now they must also satisfy the <code>"MyCustomPolicy"</code> policy. If they don't, they'll be redirected to an access denied page for Razor Pages apps (or receive a <code>403</code> for APIs).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember, this policy applies <em>globally</em> so you need to ensure your "Login" and "AccessDenied" pages are decorated with <code>[AllowAnonymous]</code>, otherwise you'll end up with endless redirects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Applying <code>AuthorizeFilter</code>s like this was the standard approach for early versions of ASP.NET Core, but ASP.NET Core 3.0 introduced <a href="https://andrewlock.net/converting-a-terminal-middleware-to-endpoint-routing-in-aspnetcore-3/#the-evolution-of-routing">endpoint routing</a>. Endpoint routing allows moving some previously-MVC-only features to being first-class citizens. Authorization is one of those features!</p>
<h2 id="using-requireauthorization-on-endpoint-definitions">Using RequireAuthorization on endpoint definitions<a href="#using-requireauthorization-on-endpoint-definitions"></a></h2>
<p>The big problem with the <code>AuthorizeFilter</code> approach is that it's an MVC-only feature. ASP.NET Core 3.0+ provides a different mechanism for setting authorization on endpoints—the <code>RequireAuthorization()</code> extension method on <code>IEndpointConventionBuilder</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of configuring a global <code>AuthorizeFilter</code>, call <code>RequireAuthorization()</code> when configuring the endpoints of your application, in <code>Configure()</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    

    
    services<span>.</span><span>AddRazorPages</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    services<span>.</span><span>AddAuthorization</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Configure</span><span>(</span><span>IApplicationBuilder</span> app<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    app<span>.</span><span>UseStaticFiles</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseRouting</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseAuthentication</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    app<span>.</span><span>UseAuthorization</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseEndpoints</span><span>(</span>endpoints <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapRazorPages</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>RequireAuthorization</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The net effect of this is the same as applying a global <code>AuthorizeFilter</code>. So why use this approach? One big advantage is the ability to add authorization for <em>other</em> endpoints, that aren't MVC or Razor Pages. For example, you could require authenticated requests for your health check endpoints:</p>
<pre><code>app<span>.</span><span>UseEndpoints</span><span>(</span>endpoints <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    
    endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapRazorPages</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>RequireAuthorization</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    
    endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapHealthChecks</span><span>(</span><span>"/healthz"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>RequireAuthorization</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As before, you can specify a different policy to apply in the call to <code>RequireAuthorization()</code>. You could also provide different policies to apply for different endpoints. In the example below I'm applying the <code>"MyCustomPolicy"</code> policy to the Razor Pages endpoints, and two policies, <code>"OtherPolicy"</code> and <code>"MainPolicy"</code> to the health check endpoints:</p>
<pre><code>app<span>.</span><span>UseEndpoints</span><span>(</span>endpoints <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    
    endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapRazorPages</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>RequireAuthorization</span><span>(</span><span>"MyCustomPolicy"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    
    endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapHealthChecks</span><span>(</span><span>"/healthz"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>RequireAuthorization</span><span>(</span><span>"OtherPolicy"</span><span>,</span> <span>"MainPolicy"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>As always, ensure you've registered the policies in the call to <code>AddAuthorization()</code>, and ensure your added <code>[AllowAnonymous]</code> to your Login Access Denied pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't provide a policy name in the <code>RequireAuthorization()</code> call, then the <em>DefaultPolicy</em> is applied. This is the same behaviour as using an <code>[Authorize]</code> filter without a policy name.</p>
<h2 id="changing-the-defaultpolicy-for-an-application">Changing the <code>DefaultPolicy</code> for an application<a href="#changing-the-defaultpolicy-for-an-application"></a></h2>
<p>The <em>DefaultPolicy</em> is the policy that is applied when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You specify that authorization is required, either using <code>RequireAuthorization()</code>, by applying an <code>AuthorizeFilter</code>, or by using the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute on your actions/Razor Pages.</li>
<li>You don't specify which policy to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Out-of-the-box, the <em>DefaultPolicy</em> is configured as the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>new</span> <span>AuthorizationPolicyBuilder</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>RequireAuthenticatedUser</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>Build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That means if you're authenticated, then you're authorized. This provides the default behaviour that you're likely familiar with, of redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page, but allowing any authenticated user access to the page.</p>
<p>You can change the <em>DefaultPolicy</em> so that an empty <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute applies a different policy in <code>UseAuthorization()</code>. For example, the following sets the <em>DefaultPolicy</em> to a policy that requires users have the Claim <code>"SomeClaim"</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>

        endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapRazorPages</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>RequireAuthorization</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapHealthChecks</span><span>(</span><span>"/healthz"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>RequireAuthorization</span><span>(</span><span>"OtherPolicy"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The example above shows when the <em>DefaultPolicy</em> is applied, and when it isn't. The <em>DefaultPolicy</em> only applies when you've request authorization <em>and</em> you haven't specified a different policy. So it only applies to the Razor Pages endpoints in the example above.</p>
<p>Applying a default policy like this can be very useful, but sometimes you want to have slightly more granular control over when to apply policies. In Razor Pages applications for example, you might want to apply a given policy to one folder, and a different policy to another folder or area. You can achieve that using Razor Pages conventions.</p>
<h2 id="applying-authorization-policies-using-conventions-with-razor-pages">Applying authorization policies using conventions with Razor Pages<a href="#applying-authorization-policies-using-conventions-with-razor-pages"></a></h2>
<p>The Razor Pages framework is designed around a whole set of conventions that are designed to make it easy to quickly build applications. However, you can customise virtually all of those conventions when your app starts, and authorization is no different.</p>
<p>The Razor Page conventions allow you to set authorization requirements based on a folder, area, or page. They also allow you to mark sections and pages with <code>AllowAnonymous</code> in situations where you need to "punch a hole" through the default authorization policy. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authorization/razor-pages-authorization">The documentation on this feature is excellent</a>, so I've just provided a brief example below:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>

    <span>{</span>
        
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>These conventions can be useful for broadly applying authorization policies to whole sections of your application. But what if you just want to apply authorization <em>everywhere</em>? That's where the <em>FallbackPolicy</em> comes in.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-fallbackpolicy-to-authorize-everything">Using the FallbackPolicy to authorize everything<a href="#using-the-fallbackpolicy-to-authorize-everything"></a></h2>
<p>The <em>FallbackPolicy</em> is applied when the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The endpoint does <em>not</em> have any authorisation applied. No <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute, no <code>RequireAuthorization</code>, nothing.</li>
<li>The endpoint does <em>not</em> have an <code>[AllowAnonymous]</code> applied, either explicitly or using conventions.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the <code>FallbackPolicy</code> only applies if you don't apply <em>any</em> other sort of authorization policy, including the <code>DefaultPolicy</code>, When that's true, the <em>FallbackPolicy</em> is used. </p>
<p>By default, the <em>FallbackPolicy</em> is a no-op; it allows all requests <em>without</em> authorization. You can change the <em>FallbackPolicy</em> in the same way as the <em>DefaultPolicy</em>, in <code>UseAuthorization</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>

    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, the <em>FallbackPolicy</em> is set to a custom policy. It only applies to the Razor Pages endpoints, as the health check endpoints have specified authorization requirements of <code>"OtherPolicy"</code> and the <em>DefaultPolicy</em>.</p>
<p>With the combination of the <em>DefaultPolicy</em>, <em>FallbackPolicy</em>, Razor Page conventions, and the <code>RequireAuthorization()</code> extension method, you have multiple ways to apply authorization "globally" in your application. Remember that you can always override the <em>DefaultPolicy</em> and <em>FallbackPolicy</em> to achieve a more specific behaviour by applying an <code>[Authorize]</code> or <code>[AllowAnonymous]</code> attribute directly to a Razor Page or action method.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary"></a></h2>
<p>In this post I described the various options available for setting global authorization policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply an <code>AuthorizeFilter</code> globally. This is no longer the recommended approach, as it is limited to MVC/Razor Pages endpoints.</li>
<li>Call <code>RequireAuthorization()</code> when configuring an endpoint in <code>UseEndpoints()</code>. You can specify a policy to apply, or leave blank to apply the <em>DefaultPolicy</em>.</li>
<li>Apply authorization to Razor Pages using conventions when you call <code>AddRazorPages()</code>. You can apply authorization policies <em>and</em> <code>[AllowAnonymous]</code> using these conventions.</li>
<li>The <em>DefaultPolicy</em> is applied when you specify that authorization is required, but don't specify a policy to apply. By default, the <em>DefaultPolicy</em> authorizes all authenticated users.</li>
<li>The <em>FallbackPolicy</em> is applied when no authorization requirements are specified, including the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute or equivalent. By default, the <em>FallbackPolicy</em> does not apply any authorization.</li>
