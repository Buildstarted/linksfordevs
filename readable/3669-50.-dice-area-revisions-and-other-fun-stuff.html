Dice Area Revisions and Other Fun Stuff</h1><div><div class="entry-content"><p>It’s been too long since I wrote a devlog entry. Mostly this has been because I’ve been doing a lot of nitty gritty puzzle design stuff, and I try to keep the blog posts fairly high level so that people can read without getting too spoiled on specific puzzles. I’ve been working through the checklist for the next test build, which involves time-consuming revisions to most of the areas in the game.</p><p>The most recent area I’ve finished revising is the “dice” puzzles. Here’s a birds-eye comparison shot between  the area “pre-revision” and after. The right version is the new and revised area.</p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-attachment-id="1863" data-permalink="https://taiji-game.com/dicearea_revision2/" data-orig-file="https://taijigame.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/dicearea_revision2.jpg" data-orig-size="1482,903" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="dicearea_revision2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://taijigame.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/dicearea_revision2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://taijigame.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/dicearea_revision2.jpg?w=656" src="https://taijigame.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/dicearea_revision2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1863"><figcaption><strong>Left: Old                         &nbsp;                  Right: New&nbsp;and&nbsp;Improved!</strong></figcaption></figure><p>You’ll notice that the overall structure of the area hasn’t changed too much, but internally there have been a lot of changes. Both some entire sets of puzzles have been added, as well as some of the earlier puzzles have been cut or moved to other areas.</p><p>I thought it might be fun to put this image alongside the previous revisions of this area, so you can see four different versions of the same area side-by-side.</p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-attachment-id="1865" data-permalink="https://taiji-game.com/dicearea_revisions_4up/" data-orig-file="https://taijigame.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/dicearea_revisions_4up.jpg" data-orig-size="1898,820" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="dicearea_revisions_4up" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://taijigame.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/dicearea_revisions_4up.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://taijigame.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/dicearea_revisions_4up.jpg?w=656" src="https://taijigame.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/dicearea_revisions_4up.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1865"><figcaption>Progress? The earliest version is on the left, and latest on the right.</figcaption></figure><p>Needless to say, the area has continued to evolve over the years, and will most likely see more changes in the future. The continuing level of flux is the main reason why it’s all still using prototype graphics. Luckily I feel like things are starting to congeal a bit more, so I should be able to start “arting it up” pretty soon.</p><p>There are 60 puzzles in the newest version of the area, although it may change to where the player is only required to solve a much smaller subset to “complete” the area.</p><h3>Area Completion</h3><p>Speaking of completing areas, I added a fun little effect that happens when you finish an area. This gives the player a bit more satisfaction at that moment and leaves them with little confusion as to whether they need to do more to finish the area.</p><p>I may or may not get it in for the next round of testing, but I’d also like to add a warp that allows the player to warp back to the central hub area after finishing a world.</p><h3>World-Space Cursor</h3><p>Something else that I spent an inordinate amount of time on over the past month or so is implementing a mouse cursor that exists in world-space instead of screen space.</p><p>This means that when the camera moves, the cursor will be fixed relative to the world. For example. if the player was interacting with a puzzle panel, and the camera moved, the mouse cursor would continue to hover over the tile on the panel that the player was originally pointing it at.</p><p>You can see a comparison below, screen-space is on the top and world-space is on the bottom. The mouse cursor is represented by a fairy.</p><p>This is good because it allows me the flexibility to move the camera without having to worry about negatively impacting the players experience.</p><p>However, since I’ve had some people complain about the possibility of this being disorienting or annoying, I’ve decided to maintain the old cursor system in parallel with the new one, until such time as I decide that the world-space cursor (or the old one) is better and I don’t need the other.</p><div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled"></div></div></div></div></div>
