<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello,</p>

<p>This week I upgraded one of my large(2.8TB), high-volume databases from 9<br>to 11. The upgrade itself went fine. About two days later, we unexpectedly<br>hit transaction ID wraparound. What was perplexing about this was that the<br>age of our oldest `datfrozenxid` was only 1.2 billion - far away from where<br>I'd expect a wraparound. Curiously, the wraparound error referred to a<br>mysterious database of `OID 0`:</p>

<p>UPDATE ERROR:  database is not accepting commands to avoid wraparound data<br>loss in database with OID 0</p>

<p>We were able to recover after a few hours by greatly speeding up our vacuum<br>on our largest table.</p>

<p>In a followup investigation I uncovered the reason we hit the wraparound so<br>early, and also the cause of the mysterious OID 0 message. When pg_upgrade<br>executes, it calls pg_resetwal to set the next transaction ID. Within<br>pg_resetwal is the following code:<br><a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/6cd404b344f7e27f4d64555bb133f18a758fe851/src/bin/pg_resetwal/pg_resetwal.c#L440-L450" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/6cd404b344f7e27f4d64555bb133f18a758fe851/src/bin/pg_resetwal/pg_resetwal.c#L440-L450</a></p>

<p>This sets the controldata to have a fake database (OID 0) on the brink of<br>transaction wraparound. Specifically, after pg_upgrade is ran, wraparound<br>will occur within around 140 million transactions (provided the autovacuum<br>doesn't finish first). I confirmed by analyzing our controldata before and<br>after the upgrade that this was the cause of our early wraparound.</p>

<p>Given the size and heavy volume of our database, we tend to complete a<br>vacuum in the time it takes around 250 million transactions to execute.<br>With our tunings this tends to be rather safe and we stay well away from<br>the wraparound point under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we had no obvious way of knowing that the upgrade would place<br>our database upon the brink of wraparound. In fact, since this info is only<br>persisted in the controldata, the only way to discover this state to my<br>knowledge would be to inspect the controldata itself. Other standard means<br>of monitoring for wraparound risk involve watching `pg_database` or<br>`pg_class`, which in this case tells us nothing helpful since the fake<br>database present in the controldata is not represented in those stats.</p>

<p>I'd like to suggest that either the pg_upgrade-&gt;pg_resetwal behaviour be<br>adjusted, or the pg_upgrade documentation highlight this potential<br>scenario. I'm happy to contribute code and/or documentation pull requests<br>to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br>Jason Harvey<br><a href="http://reddit.com/" rel="nofollow">reddit.com</a><br></p></div></div></div>
