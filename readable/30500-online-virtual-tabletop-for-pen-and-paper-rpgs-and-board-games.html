The people. While it’s not quite as good as getting around a table in person, our voice and video chat features help you see and hear your players as they spin epic tales of battle and intrigue. It doesn't require any setup, simply a WebRTC compatible browser. If you're on a slower connection, turn off the video and go audio-only. Don’t miss out on your players’ expressions during a critical roll! <a class="alink" href="https://wiki.roll20.net/Video_and_Voice_Chat">Read more...</a></p></div><div class="col-md-4 text-col tour-col"><img src="/v2/images/3D%20Dice%20SS.png"><h2><strong> Dice Rolls (3D + QuantumRoll) </strong></h2><p> When you're playing online, you want to make sure your rolls are as fair as possible. We've gone the extra mile to enable our dice engine to be powered by a source of "true" randomness -- based on the power fluctuations of a split beam of light. If that sounds like overkill, it is -- but you'll thank us for it when you roll that critical hit. In fact, our dice are more fair than rolling in-person. Don't believe it? We've put ourselves to the test, and   you can see for yourself. </p><p> Roll20 also features 3D Dice, which allow you to see a 3D physics simulation right in your browser whenever you perform a dice roll. Any other players with 3D Dice enabled will see your roll happening in real-time on their computer as well, so you can all share in the excitement of that crucial crit! </p></div><div class="col-md-4 text-col tour-col"><img src="/v2/images/TabletSS.png"><h2><strong> iPad + Android Apps </strong></h2><p> Upgrade your in-person experience with the Roll20 for iPad and Roll20 for Android free-to-use mobile tablet apps. Featuring digital dice, character sheets, handouts, and quick access to game rules, these apps eliminate the need for keeping paper sheets up to date and speed up gameplay through built-in rolls and macros. Whether you use them to complement running your game on the Roll20 Virtual Tabletop or just want to replace your paper sheets, they’re the perfect way to level up your in-person play!</p></div></div></div></div>
