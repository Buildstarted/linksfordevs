NREL found that prices for commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) systems fell a still-impressive 15% over the last year to an average of $1.85 per watt-DC, while prices for residential systems fell only 6% to $2.80 per watt.</p><p>This means LCOE of $92-120/MWh for C&amp;I systems, and $129-167/MWh for residential systems. This is still well below SunShot goals for unsubsidized solar and given the current rate of price declines residential solar may not meet its SunShot target in 2020.</p><p>However, when the effect of the ITC is calculated, such costs fall significantly, putting the average cost of residential PV below $100/MWh.</p><p><img src="https://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nrel_us_pv_-590x354.jpg" alt="nrel_us_pv_" width="548" height="329" srcset="https://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nrel_us_pv_-590x354.jpg 590w, https://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nrel_us_pv_-300x180.jpg 300w, https://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nrel_us_pv_.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px"></p><p>NREL notes that this points to the difficulty in reducing non-hardware “soft” costs, which have increased to two-thirds of the cost of residential systems and 59% of C&amp;I systems.</p><p><em>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2017/09/15/nrel-u-s-fixed-tilt-solar-plant-costs-fall-to-1-03watt-dc-with-charts/">PV Magazine</a>.
