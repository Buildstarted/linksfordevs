This is usually due to an HTTP request (or some other operation) that's kicked off. Clicking twice is <em>usually</em> an error.</p><p>I propose something to more easily handle this case:</p><div class="highlight highlight-text-html-basic"><pre>&lt;<span class="pl-ent">button</span><span class="pl-e">once</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>true<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>&gt;Foo&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">button</span>&gt;</pre></div><p>This would be equivalent to:</p><div class="highlight highlight-text-html-basic"><pre>&lt;<span class="pl-ent">button</span><span class="pl-e">onclick</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>this.disabled = true;<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>&gt;Foo&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">button</span>&gt;</pre></div><p>As a bonus, we could consider a CSS addition along the lines of:</p><div class="highlight highlight-source-css"><pre><span class="pl-ent">button</span>:loading { // ...<span class="pl-c1">or</span><span class="pl-c1">button</span>:<span class="pl-c1">disabled</span>:loading perhaps?
  // spinny thing, but no seizures please!
}</pre></div><p><sub>(maybe that naming is terrible, but the idea is what I want to convey)</sub></p><p>I'd love to have something like this. We could save so much JavaScript written and cases where it's not written continually caught and addressed. The user would only need to <em>re-enable</em> the button when the operation completes and it's valid to do so...the same thing they need to do today, no net change on the tail end.</p><p>In the non-JavaScript case...things just work. With no JS in play, we're in a full form submission/reload scenario, so this just lets you not even use JavaScript to protect the simple case. To me, this may be the strongest argument for such an attribute.</p><p>When building apps, I'd even go so far as to validate it (in our tooling). Having an attribute makes that easy to reason about and check for. A sea of JavaScript and possibly-attached handlers isn't, though to be fair inline we could check for.</p><p>Thoughts?</p></div></div></div></div>
