      <p>Hey hey! Time for another Dicey news post. What’s been happening lately?</p>
<center><img src="https://distractionware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/realdice.jpg" width="640"><br>
<big><b>Hey, we’re on twitter</b></big></center>
<p>Did you know we had a twitter account? I made it ages ago and kinda forgot about it for a while, but recently Niamh, Marlowe and I have all been making more of an effort to actually use it and post interesting stuff about the game and what we’re working on. <a href="https://twitter.com/diceydungeons">Check it out here</a> if you’re interested!</p>

<big><b>Dicey Dungeons world tour</b></big></center>
<p>If you’re wondering what’s taking so long with v0.17, it’s mostly this: We went on tour! We showed the game at three shows in a row, back to back – GDC, PAX East, and then EGX Rezzed in London, trying to tell everyone we could about our little dice game.</p>
<p>(People warned me that PAX East was the big one and YIKES they weren’t kidding. It was great, though!)</p>
<p>I kinda enjoyed doing the whole convention thing a lot more than I expected to, tbh – but it’s pretty draining. It took me a week or so to really get back to feeling normal afterwards. I feel super proud of our little team for managing to pull this world tour thing off, though.</p>

<big><b>There are mods for Dicey Dungeons now</b></big></center>
<p>Since v0.16 rolled around, Dicey Dungeons modding has started to take off in a big way! I’d like to bring your attention to two in particular:</p>
<p><a href="https://jackeea.itch.io/more-fluff">More Fluff</a> by Jackeea: Adds more than 100+ new pieces of equipment into the existing episodes of the game!</p>
<p><a href="https://themysticsword.itch.io/dd-megaquest">Megaquest</a> by TheMysticSword: Adds 11 new quests to the game!</p>
<p>Both of these are a work in progress, but they’re already super fun! Go check em out!</p>

<big><b>Let’s play Dicey Dungeons</b></big></center>
<p>Since I last did a news update, Dicey Dungeons has really taken off on youtube and twitch! I watch a lot of videos of the game, and in particular I’d like to highlight the following people who’ve been doing great series lately:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkG-zhy1pVuk9VnTQ7AJVPwGLkfDpQ73W">Angory Tom</a> has posted more than a dozen videos of the game now, including recently some videos of some of the stranger episodes like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiSOKrAVfh8&amp;list=PLkG-zhy1pVuk9VnTQ7AJVPwGLkfDpQ73W&amp;index=14&amp;t=0s">You Choose, You Lose</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOOK8ttOP1A&amp;list=PLkG-zhy1pVuk9VnTQ7AJVPwGLkfDpQ73W&amp;index=15&amp;t=0s">The Inevitability of Rust</a>. His videos are tightly edited and great to watch – I particularly loved the Witch run from the embedded video above!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAwWN1A7O-OTfZWd89_SC0VWtqH5b48Zf">Retromation’s amazing series</a> is at 46 videos and counting – including multiple attempts at some of the really hard episodes, like Classic Hard Mode Robot. I particularly liked this recent attempt at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8aTr3yzp5o&amp;list=PLAwWN1A7O-OTfZWd89_SC0VWtqH5b48Zf&amp;index=43">Expect the Unexpected</a> – but then, I just love it when people play Witch. She’s the best character both to play as, and to watch.</p>
<p>I’ve also been enjoying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLateWiNrGEtrDutfDrGiK6O8TLgMgRllP">Olexa’s</a> series on the game, now 17 episodes in. Olexa is pretty great at narrating what he’s thinking, and as a maybe slightly less hardcore player, he’s pretty fun to watch and cheer for!</p>

<big><b>We’re working on v0.17, and the final version</b></big></center>
<p>I’ve mentioned this in the notes for the last update – but the next alpha will also be the *last* alpha. There won’t be a v0.18 – this is it. After v0.17, the next version is gonna be v1.0, and we’re finally gonna launch this thing for real. It’s pretty exciting!</p>
<p>I hadn’t planned to make the next alpha a big one – mostly I wanted it to be a “stable”, reliable build. Still, it seems like I couldn’t help myself – there is a bunch of exciting new stuff coming soon, including redesigned hard modes, more episodes, and a bunch of new music and art. That hopefully should be ready sometime in the next few weeks!</p>
<p>After that: we just have to finish the game. It’s so close now!</p>
<center><img src="https://distractionware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/crowbar.gif" width="640"><br>
<big><b>The alpha is coming to an end</b></big></center>
<p>I usually end these news posts with a boilerplate reminder that you can wishlist us on steam (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/861540/Dicey_Dungeons/">you can, right here!</a>), or buy the alpha at a discount on itch.io (<a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/dicey-dungeons">right here!</a>), but I have one extra thing to say this time: the alpha won’t be around forever. Sometime shortly after v0.17, we’ll be bringing the alpha to an <i>end</i>, and focusing all of our energy on having a big big launch. If you’ve already gotten it on itch, you’ll still be able to play, of course, but after the alpha ends, it won’t be on sale for a while.</p>
<p>I think the game’s an absolute bargain right now at $7.50, so if you haven’t already, <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/dicey-dungeons">grab it while you still can!</a></p>
