<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-click-id="text"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>As classrooms transition into remote learning, we believe there is a shift in focus of many aspects of delivering instruction. One of the most important aspects is student engagement. While student engagement is always incredibly important in the classroom, at times where these students are relatively isolated, focusing on creativity, collaboration and interactivity is crucial.</p><p>We’ve designed an <strong>entirely</strong> <strong>free</strong> program that works well in both synchronous and asynchronous learning settings. In many ways the materials really focus on some of the most important parts of remote instruction. For example, we have an incredibly flexible curriculum that handles most of the technical instruction, allowing for teachers to act as facilitators of their students’ learning . Our content is designed around creativity, problem solving and interactivity while also providing immediate feedback to students with an online IDE and autograder. There is a Teacher Portal full of resources for teachers to monitor student progress, assign collaborative tasks, quizzes and view grades from afar. We also understand that this is a very small window to try to learn a new platform. Our team is always available to provide support through our site and we are running daily open webinars to get you started. <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/splash" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Check out our website</a> and <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/r/1888" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">sign up for a free teacher account</a>.</p><p>Here are some exercises students would code up: <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/violetDeer2996" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>, <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/yellowGreenFrog3630" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Giraffe</a>, <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/peachPuffMonkey0466" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Invaders Lite</a>And here are our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FKPUAN79oFi612b0escY27iI_23X5W3FDX-d-i0nT4U/edit#slide=id.g709626b8fd_0_117" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">October 2019 Creative Student Work winners!</a>: <a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/tomatoBee5869" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Led Zeppelin</a></p><p>We would love to share our knowledge, so Ask Us Anything about CMU CS Academy, remote teaching, learning/teaching CS or anything else!
