<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="speakable-summary">Online alcohol delivery startup Drizly has told customers that it was hit by a data breach.</p><p>In an email to customers obtained by TechCrunch, the company said that a hacker “obtained” some customer data. The hacker took customer email addresses, date-of-birth, hashed passwords, and in some cases delivery address, the email read.</p><p>Some 2.4 million Drizly accounts are believed to have been stolen. TechCrunch obtained a portion of the data, including several accounts of Drizly staff members. We verified the data against public records. The portion of data we obtained also contains user phone numbers, IP addresses, and geolocation data associated with the user’s billing address.</p><p>Drizly did not say when the hack occurred or how many accounts were affected, but did advise users to change their passwords. <span>We reached out to the company for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.</span></p><p>The company said that no financial data was taken in the breach. But a listing on a dark web marketplace from a well-known seller of stolen data claims otherwise.</p><p><div id="attachment_2023555"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2023555" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-2.54.01-PM.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-2.54.01-PM.jpg 1624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-2.54.01-PM.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-2.54.01-PM.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-2.54.01-PM.jpg?resize=768,492 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-2.54.01-PM.jpg?resize=680,435 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-2.54.01-PM.jpg?resize=1536,984 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-2.54.01-PM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2023555">The listing was posted in February 2020.

The seller did not say when the breach took place, but the listing appears to have been posted on February 13. Although no sample of data was offered, the listing claims to have valid Drizly credit card numbers and users’ order history.</p><p>Drizly has become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/online-liquor-store-drizly-just-landed-34-5-million-in-fresh-funding/">one of the biggest</a> online alcohol delivery services in the U.S. and Canada, raising over $68 million to date, rivaling Minibar and Delivery.com.</p><hr><p><i>Send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp to +1 646-755-8849, or email: zack.whittaker@protonmail.com</i></p></div></div></div>
