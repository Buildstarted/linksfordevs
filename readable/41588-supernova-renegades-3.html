As with any beloved instalment of a final series, I definitely wasn&#x2019;t ready to say goodbye to these characters- and honestly I hope that there&#x2019;s going to be more set in this world, because that epilogue was such a wicked teaser, too!Nova, one half of our main characters and narrators, had always thought that the Renegades were to blame for the tragic death of her parents and little sister, where were they, with their always promises to protect their people? They&#x2019;re meant to be the Superheroes! So when we first meet her in&#xA0;Renegades,&#xA0;I completely felt her anguish throughout, her want to exact revenge. See, Nova has a particularly wicked power as one of the&#xA0;Archenenies, sworn to exact revenge on the&#xA0;Renegades,&#xA0;she&#x2019;s even given herself an alias as one of them too! Between&#xA0;Renegades&#xA0;and&#xA0;Archenemies,&#xA0;things had been building up to one huge, epic finale of completely wild proportions!Every moment of&#xA0;Supernova&#xA0;was just that! Every moment was a race of not even knowing what would come next- see, chemistry has definitely bloomed between Nova and Adrian, two of our main characters, who still keep their aliases under wraps from one another &#x2013; and everyone. I was honestly on such tenderhooks throughout, I felt that surely they would finally discover the truths about one another, and even though I knew there would be devastating repercussions from this, it needed to happen! But what was even more amazing, as is always the case with Marissa Meyer, who has longtime been a favourite author of mine, she spins a story one way, just as she had established a wicked build up of epic proportions, just when I thought everything was starting to make sense (which it had been, but I mean, just when things appeared to come to the surface and truths would arise), then BAM! Marissa Meyer weaves even more plot twists and brilliance into&#xA0;Supernova!What makes this final instalment so memorable and completely epic to me though, is just that Adrian and Nova have always been such likeable characters! Adrian, the son of two of the strongest Renegade gentlemen, who lost his beloved Mother at such a young age, who is so dedicated to justice in the world, who adores his little brother and will try his hardest to see that he can have as regular upbringing as someone in his fragile condition, his blind adoration of Nova, his utter dedication to his friends, he&#x2019;s just amazing!Nova too, who just always wanted to bring her beloved Uncle back to fruition, who always thought that he was the only one who understood her, the only family she has left &#x2013; Ace Anarchy, who wants nothing more than to reign havoc on the Renegades and end their supposed brainwashing reign, where they have always, according to him, called the shots in the town, as they&#x2019;re the ones who people listen to, but Ace Anarchy thinks people shouldn&#x2019;t have to put up with the seemingly contradictory ways of the&#xA0;Renegades,&#xA0;who preach about always delivering justice fairly but would speak of ending the lives of enemies without a hitch!Something which has also been prevalent throughout all three novels, I&#x2019;ve found, but most specially in this one, is that Marissa Meyer always made me think about&#xA0;good versus evil, honestly, Nova especially has this weighing on her throughout the finale and her actions throughout are completely stellar! Even at times, I didn&#x2019;t even know what she may do next, but it was an absolute wild reading experience finding out!<p>Supernova&#xA0;is definitely going into my all time favourite books list, and frankly I think that I&#x2019;ll be living in this one for a good while yet! Every one of those five hundred and sixty pages were freaking brilliant and had such excitement, the build up and final battle and of course aftermath were one I will&#xA0;NEVER&#xA0;forget! I really hope that we get more set in this world at a later stage, honestly, I would read an infinite number of books set in it!</p></div> <a href="#">...more</a> </span> </p> </div>
