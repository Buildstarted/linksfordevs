Who hasn't been to Black Hat and seen cascading waterfalls of 1s and 0s everywhere?</p><div class="CaptionedImage Border width_85"><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/08/31/hacker_shutterstock.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/08/31/hacker_shutterstock.jpg?x=442&amp;y=295&amp;infer_y=1" alt="hacker" title="hacker" height="295" width="442"></a><p class="text_center">Awful, isn't it?</p></div><p>To stimulate the minds of graphics people, Open Ideo has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openideo.com/challenge-briefs/cybersecurity-visuals">published a brief</a> about the target audiences for their challenge. They include a description of a "high-profile journalist":</p><p>We don't know why low-profile journalists (cough cough) don't get a look-in. Perhaps Open Ideo are resigned to the idea that the great unwashed outside America will continue gratuitously publishing imagery of hoodie hackers because nobody's giving us anything better to work with – at least, not without charging megabucks in the process.</p><p>A similar pen picture for a low-profile journalist needing non-hoodie imagery might say the following:</p><p>"Up to 25 shortlisted contributors will receive mentorship from a cybersecurity expert and $500 each," we are told by Open Ideo, while five more lucky non-hoodie-artists will have $7,000 bestowed upon each of them.</p><p>If you are a Russian or from Eastern Europe, however, bad news: you're not eligible for the prize. Only folk from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom, and the good ol' US of A can claim their spondulicks.</p><h3 class="crosshead"><span>Alright, the serious bit</span></h3><p>Mickey-taking aside, the lack of useful imagery about what "cybersecurity" involves is a genuine problem for the industry as a whole.</p><p>Joe Public doesn't know or care about the differences between a white hat and a black hat (grey hats are right out) and telly news stations, bound to compress the world's complexities into 2m 30s of footage that even your granny could understand, grab the first easy image they can think of and run with that.</p><div class="CaptionedImage Border width_85"><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/11/16/hacker_shutterstock.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/11/16/hacker_shutterstock.jpg?x=442&amp;y=295&amp;infer_y=1" alt="Hacker" title="Hacker" height="295" width="442"></a><p class="text_center">Seriously. Everyone outside it thinks infosec is some bastard offspring of <i>The Matrix</i> and that dodgy underpass near your house where the bad kids hang out</p></div><p>By shifting that image of what a cybersecurity professional looks like, the wider industry stands to gain a lot and lose very little. Who doesn't want to be taken seriously by the wider world, all those know-nothing civilians whose very digital-dependent way of life depends on the uptime underwritten by "those weirdos in hoodies down in the basement"?</p><p>As the allegedly porcine-fancying former UK Prime Minister David Cameron didn't quite say, it's time to stop hugging hoodies.</p><p>Get cracking. Your industry really does need you. ®</p><p>*Part of this statement may or may not be untrue</p><p class="wptl btm"><span>Sponsored: </span><a href="https://go.theregister.co.uk/tl/1889/-8120/detecting-cyber-attacks-as-a-small-to-medium-business?td=wptl1889">Detecting cyber attacks as a small to medium business</a></p></div></div></div></div>
