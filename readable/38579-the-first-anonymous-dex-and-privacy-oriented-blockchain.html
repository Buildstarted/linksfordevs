    <h1>The First Anonymous DEX and Privacy-Oriented Blockchain</h1>
    <div id="wrapper"> <p class="w1"> <section class="intro-section"> </section> <section class="info-section"> </section> <section class="content-section" id="roadmap"> <div class="container"> <div class="two-columns"> <div class="text-area animated-bottom"> <p><span>Resistance was built by a team of cybersecurity experts with the core values of privacy, decentralization, and democratic mining at the forefront of its development.</span> </p> <div class="tabs-text"> <div class="tab" id="tab01"> <p><span>The fundamental principle of privacy is at the heart of Resistance, which harnesses the power of zero-knowledge proofs to ensure your payment transactions remain private, and Tor to shield your IP at every step. </span></p>
<p><span>Tor can be turned on or off with the click of a button, while the Resistance coin, RES, can be used as an intermediary to ensure private trading on ResDEX. Users will always have the flexibility they require.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p>What&#x2019;s more, our dedication to privacy and shielded transactions means Resistance is fungible; all coins are equal and untainted by previous transactions when<span> they are routed through z-addresses</span><span>. </span></p> </div> <div class="tab" id="tab02"> <p>We believe everyone should have the freedom to participate in equal and competitive mining, where specialized hardware doesn&#x2019;t have an unfair advantage over the CPUs found in most consumer&#x2019;s computers. </p>
<p>Using our CPU-miner, integrated into the Resistance Desktop Application, all that&#x2019;s required is a laptop or desktop computer with Linux, macOS, or Windows to start mining on our CPU-optimized* blockchain immediately. </p>
<p>*Read <a href="https://www.resistance.io/faq/">How is Resistance becoming practically ASIC-resistant?</a></p> </div> <div class="tab" id="tab03"> <p>BOINC is an open-source platform for volunteer computing which utilizes a computer&#x2019;s idle time to work on scientific projects. Tapping into this resource, we are able to reward users with Proof of Research on our whitelisted BOINC projects. </p>
<p>This allows users to make a positive impact on the world, contributing to projects dealing with Alzheimer&#x2019;s, cancer research, nanotechnology for clean water, malaria, molecular biology, solar power, and more. </p>
<p><span>With our Proof of Research algorithm, instead of mining on a hash calculation, you are contributing computing power to make a positive impact on humanity &#x2013; and get RES coins for it. </span></p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="text-box js-tilt animated-bottom"> <p><span>The Resistance privacy-focused DEX, ResDEX, empowers its users to trade directly with each other through our easy-to-use interface. Users have the freedom to trade cryptocurrency coins while maintaining their right to privacy. Our open-source philosophy ensures that our code remains transparent.</span></p>
<p><span>We cut out the middleman and provide a platform which allows users to trade coins directly from one person to another, without requiring them to tie up their funds in escrow, trade derivatives, or pass through a centralized exchange.</span></p>
<p><span>Currency trading is secured with </span><span>atomic swaps</span><span>, incentivizin</span><span>g each party to uphold their side of the bargain and penalizing those who don&#x2019;t. For added security, the user can enable the following two options with a simple on/off button. The first option protects your privacy, defending against network surveillance and traffic analysis by routing network traffic through Tor. The second option uses the privacy-oriented Resistance coin, RES, as an intermediary during the trade which adds privacy, preventing anyone from tracking a transaction from one user to another. </span></p>
<p><span>ResDEX supports approximately 95% of existing cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens. There is no registration process required to begin trading on ResDEX, nor are there any withdrawal limits. &#xA0;</span></p> </div> <div class="features-block"> <p class="animated-bottom">Benefits of the Resistance Desktop Application compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows</p> </div> </div> <svg id="curve2" class="curve i-v"> <path id="path-white" class="path"/> </svg> </section> <section class="stats-section"> <div class="container"> <div class="two-cols row"> <div class="col col-1-2"> <div class="table-responsive"> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> </p> </div>
