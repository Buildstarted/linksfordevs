name, I'm calling this project "wasm2cil".
In a nutshell, it's a .NET compiler for WebAssembly/WASI 
modules.</p><p>I might be misusing the term "compiler".  Maybe this
should be called a "transpiler" or a "translator".  
Whatever you call it, what this project does is take a WebAssembly 
module and convert it into a .NET assembly on disk.
The resulting DLL is not interpreted -- it contains
the same functions as the WebAssembly module, translated
from Wasm instructions to CIL instructions.</p><p>For example, I can start with the C code for SQLite and
its shell application, compile it to Wasm with Clang,
"transpile" it to a .NET assembly,
and then run it with .NET Core.  The result is the SQLite
shell, entirely as managed code, with no pinvokes involved.</p><p>All of this is very much a work in progress.</p><p>But the current status is that some basic things
do work.  For example, the ".NET-ified SQLite shell" can read and 
write SQLite database files 
that seem to be fully interoperable with "regular" SQLite
builds.</p><h2>Pardon our dust</h2><p>Like I said, this isn't ready for anybody to try
using for anything serious.  Just off the top of my
head, the core stuff has the following problems:</p><ul><li><p>Some of the WebAssembly instructions aren't implemented yet.</p></li><li><p>A few WebAssembly instructions are implemented with slow/dreadful placeholders.</p></li><li><p>Quite a few WASI methods are not implemented yet.</p></li><li><p>The WASI spec itself is still in flux and will probably change before it is finalized.</p></li><li><p>My WASI implementation currently only works on .NET Core (because it uses things like Stream.Read(Span&lt;byte&gt;) for performance).</p></li></ul><p>The main thing I use to drive this project forward is
attempts to get real C code (compiled by Clang 8) working.
So, if a certain WebAssembly instruction is still throwing NotImplementedException() in my code,
that's probably because I haven't seen it come out the back end of Clang
yet.</p><p>And the SQLite stuff has problems of its own.
Most notably, the VFS (platform layer) I'm using is based on the "demo" VFS, which is not full-featured.</p><p>So this blog post is NOT me announcing the release of a polished project 
that is ready for use.  Rather, this is like I started remodeling my living 
room.  And then I waited until everything was torn apart and covered with dust.
And then I invited people to watch me continue working.  This is messy,
and it will continue to be so for a while.</p><h2>Under the hood</h2><p>(Clang/LLVM 8 with wasi-sysroot) = Awesome</p><p>Initially, I wasn't thinking about WASI at all.
I just wanted to get Wasm instructions converted over
to CIL instructions.  My early test modules didn't
have any external dependencies.  I started with
things like:</p><pre class="screen">int foo(int x) 
{ 
    return x + 42;
}
</pre><p>As things progressed, I got more ambitious and started to
work on things that needed a few library functions.
The first real C program that worked was miniray.c, a little ray tracer.  
Its only deps are floating point math plus putchar() and puts().
(And since the puts() call was a string literal, I replaced it
with 15 putchar() calls so I would only have one IO function to implement.)
Anyway, I remember the moment when I first got my
CIL version to output the same image as the regular native build.
We compiler writers often find joy in two files with
differing provenance and identical contents.</p><p>Eventually I decided to dive in and try to get SQLite to work.
The key here is wasi-sysroot, an implementation
of libc that only needs WASI for its "system calls".</p><p>Using Clang 8, instead of building like this:</p><pre class="screen">clang --target=wasm32 ...
</pre><p>Build with this:</p><pre class="screen">clang --sysroot=/path/to/wasi-sysroot --target=wasm32-unknown-wasi ...
</pre><p>The result is that a whole bunch of functionality suddenly started
working.  For example, I had been figuring I would have to write
malloc() and free(), but this WASI-based-libc includes that.  And
strcmp() and memset() and printf() and so on.</p><p>Viewing my "clang-8/wasi-sysroot/wasm2cil" pipeline as a
C compiler gives me lots of ways to test it.  For example, on
GitHub I found a C compiler testsuite with 220 test cases.
My "compiler" passes 219 of them, and the one failing test
does not appear to be related to a problem in my code.</p><p>(BTW, I was excited to get these results, but I also understand
that the serious commercial test suites (like Plum Hall) are
far more comprehensive.)</p><h2>An alternative to pinvoke</h2><p>Why am I doing this?  Several reasons.</p><p>For one, I just wanted the experience.  I haven't done anything 
so compiler-ish since the 68000 C compiler I wrote back around 1991.  (Anybody
else remember the Mac SE/30?)  I've been feeling the need to get 
a better understanding of .NET at the CLR level, and getting my
hands really dirty is the best way to do that.</p><p>I am also generally interested in the possibilities of compiling other 
languages for the CLR.  And using WebAssembly as an intermediate step is one
way to do that.  I maintain SQLitePCL.raw (a low-level wrapper around SQLite),
so when it comes to the issues of mixing unmanaged code with .NET, 
I have suffered more than most.  
Wouldn't life be grand if we could compile C code into a .NET
assembly?</p><p>And Rust too.  I want to be able to write stuff in Rust and
(more easily) consume it from .NET.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>I haven't done any careful benchmarking, so I'm not yet ready to say
anything quantitative.  However, I will say informally that
the performance of C code converted to CIL has NOT been disappointing.</p><h2>Links and Acknowledgments</h2><p>I plan to write more about this project as I continue
moving it forward.  For now, I just want to give mention
to the various resources I have found helpful:</p><p>The WebAssembly spec is not exactly easy to read, but it's a
very high quality piece of work:</p><p><a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/">https://webassembly.github.io/spec/</a></p><p>WASI means "WebAssembly System Interface".  It's all about the use of 
WebAssembly outside the browser, and IMHO, it's going to be huge.
