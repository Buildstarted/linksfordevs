<p>This project, intended for professional IT security auditing use, aims to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow tables</a> for NTLM 9-character passwords using the <em>full</em> U.S. keyboard character set. &#xA0;Generation will be done using the open-source <a href="https://github.com/jtesta/rainbowcrackalack">Rainbow Crackalack</a> code. &#xA0;Compared to brute-force searching, password auditing with these tables can be <em><strong>19 times more efficient</strong></em> in terms of time and electricity usage!</p>
<p>Several milestones for the project are set:</p>
<ul> <li>10% coverage of the entire keyspace.</li> <li>25% coverage of the entire keyspace.</li> <li>50% coverage of the entire keyspace.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first and second milestones (10% &amp; 25% coverage) are guaranteed to succeed even without any funding. &#xA0;However, 50% coverage can only be attained with the purchase of additional GPU (&amp; support) hardware. &#xA0;Along with electrical costs to power the equipment, this is where all project funds will go towards.</p>
<p>It should be noted that even 10% coverage can be extremely useful in some real-world scenarios. &#xA0;For example, if NTLM hashes for 20 high-privilege accounts were obtained, cracking with this limited set would yield two plaintext passwords on average. &#xA0;And as any experienced penetration tester would confirm, all that&apos;s really needed is one cracked hash...</p>
<p>Ideally, 95%+ coverage is desirable, but experimentation with 8-character NTLM tables showed that pushing past 70% is problematic. &#xA0;Namely, the efficiency of raw tables begins to drop very significantly; in the 80% range, 1 TB of raw tables yields only 37 GB of processed and usable data (only 4% efficiency!). &#xA0;Given that the 9-character keyspace is 95 times larger than the 8-character keyspace, this implies that roughly over 150 TB would be needed, which would take many years to generate with the project&apos;s existing hardware, along with many thousands of dollars in electricity costs. &#xA0;We will attempt to crowd-source free help from the community regardless.</p>
<p>Every <strong>$3,000</strong> the project raises, a new 6 x NVIDIA RTX 2060 machine can be purchased and operated for six months (hydro-electric power is cheaply sourced from Niagara Falls). &#xA0;At least one new machine is needed. &#xA0;If over <strong>$10,000</strong> is raised, additional machines based on the NVIDIA RTX 2070, 2070 Ti, 2080, and/or 2080 Ti will be built. &#xA0;This is estimated to yield results in the 65% range in 5-6 months.</p>
<p>Funding up to <strong>$100,000</strong> can be effectively used; reaching this limit would make 99% coverage of all 9-character NTLM passwords nearly guaranteed!</p>
<p>No matter the outcome, all tables will be made publicly available <em>for free</em> via BitTorrent on the project website (<a href="https://www.rainbowcrackalack.com/">https://www.rainbowcrackalack.com/</a>). &#xA0;Hard drives pre-loaded with the tables can be purchased for convenience/sponsorship.</p>
<p><em>Together, we can Make Rainbow Tables Great Again!</em></p>

<div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks"> <p>Running multiple GPUs constantly at full capacity for months can result in hardware failures, which would in turn cause delays. Failures in the existing hardware would result in even longer delays, as that equipment is no longer under warranty.</p> <p>In the worst-case scenario, where only one new 6-GPU machine is obtained, and the existing equipment fails (and cannot be replaced), the 25% coverage milestone may need to be pushed from November 2019 to January 2020. However, if multiple new machines are purchased, single failures won&apos;t likely cause significant disruptions.</p> <p>Project success is also dependent on accurate estimates made from experimentation on 8-character tables. Once reached, the results from the 10% milestone can be extrapolated to verify the accuracy of the remaining targets.</p>
