<p>Reports of <b>organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners</b> and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner" title="Political prisoner">political prisoners</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> have raised increasing concern by some groups within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community" title="International community">international community</a>. According to the reports,<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> political prisoners, mainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> practitioners, are being executed "on demand" in order to provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation" title="Organ transplantation">organs for transplant</a> to recipients. The organ harvesting is said to be taking place both as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party" title="Chinese Communist Party">Chinese Communist Party</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong" title="Persecution of Falun Gong">persecution of Falun Gong</a> and because of the financial incentives available to the institutions and individuals involved in the trade.
</p><p>Reports on systematic organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners first emerged in 2006, though the practice is thought by some to have started six years earlier. Several researchers—most notably Canadian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a> lawyer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Matas" title="David Matas">David Matas</a>, former parliamentarian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kilgour" title="David Kilgour">David Kilgour</a> and investigative journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Gutmann" title="Ethan Gutmann">Ethan Gutmann</a>—estimate that tens of thousands of Falun Gong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_conscience" title="Prisoner of conscience">prisoners of conscience</a> have been killed to supply a lucrative trade in human organs and cadavers and that these abuses may be ongoing.<sup id="cite_ref-Slaughter_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Slaughter-2">[2]</a></sup> These conclusions are based on a combination of statistical analysis; interviews with former prisoners, medical authorities and public security agents; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence" title="Circumstantial evidence">circumstantial evidence</a>, such as the large number of Falun Gong practitioners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicially_detained" title="Extrajudicially detained">detained extrajudicially</a> in China and the profits to be made from selling organs.
</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China" title="Government of China">Chinese government</a> has consistently denied the allegations. However, the perceived failure of Chinese authorities to effectively address or refute the charges has drawn attention and public condemnation from some governments, international organizations and medical societies. The parliaments of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>, as well as the Foreign Affairs Committee of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._House_of_Representatives" title="U.S. House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, have adopted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(law)" title="Resolution (law)">resolutions</a> condemning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_procurement" title="Organ procurement">organ harvesting</a> from Falun Gong prisoners of conscience. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Special_Rapporteur" title="United Nations Special Rapporteur">United Nations Special Rapporteurs</a> have called on the Chinese government to account for the sources of organs used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation" title="Organ transplantation">transplant</a> practices, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Medical_Association" title="World Medical Association">World Medical Association</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Transplantation" title="American Society of Transplantation">American Society of Transplantation</a> and the Transplantation Society have called for sanctions on Chinese medical authorities. Several countries have also taken or considered measures to deter their citizens from travelling to China for the purpose of obtaining organs. A documentary on organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Harvest_(film)" title="Human Harvest (film)">Human Harvest</a></i>, received a 2014 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_Award" title="Peabody Award">Peabody Award</a> recognizing excellence in broadcast journalism.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

<p>China has one of the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplant" title="Organ transplant">organ transplant</a> programs in the world. Although China does not keep nationwide statistics on transplant volume, Chinese officials estimated that as many as 20,000 organ transplants were performed in 2006<sup id="cite_ref-ChinaDaily_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-ChinaDaily-4">[4]</a></sup>, and approximately 9,000 of these were kidney and liver transplants<sup id="cite_ref-Lancet2008_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-Lancet2008-5">[5]</a></sup>. Some sources say the actual number of transplants is significantly higher, based on detailed analysis of hospital records.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> As a matter of culture and custom, however, China has extremely low rates of voluntary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation" title="Organ donation">organ donation</a>. Between 2003 and 2009, for instance, only 130 people volunteered to be organ donors.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup> In 2010 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross_Society_of_China" title="Red Cross Society of China">Chinese Red Cross</a> launched a nationwide initiative to attract voluntary organ donors, but only 37 people signed up.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Due to low levels of voluntary organ donation, most organs used in transplants are sourced from prisoners. The Chinese government approved a regulation in 1984 to allow the removal of organs from executed criminals, provided they give prior consent or if no one claims the body.<sup id="cite_ref-HRW_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-HRW-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>Despite the absence of an organized system of organ donation or allocation, wait times for obtaining vital organs in China are among the shortest in the world—often just weeks for organs such as kidneys, livers, and hearts. This has made it a destination for international transplant tourism<sup id="cite_ref-DavidMcNeill_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-DavidMcNeill-10">[10]</a></sup> and a major venue for tests of pharmaceutical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-rejection_drug&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Anti-rejection drug (page does not exist)">anti-rejection drugs</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-stateorgansArne_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-stateorgansArne-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-IndustryWatch_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-IndustryWatch-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Phi_13-0"><a href="#cite_note-Phi-13">[13]</a></sup> The commercial trade in human organs has also been a lucrative source of revenue for the Chinese medical, military and public security establishments.<sup id="cite_ref-JHR2003_14-0"><a href="#cite_note-JHR2003-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup> Because there is no effective nationwide organ donation or allocation system, hospitals source organs from local brokers, including through their connections to courts, detention centers and prisons.<sup id="cite_ref-stateorgansMatas_16-0"><a href="#cite_note-stateorgansMatas-16">[16]</a></sup>
</p><p>Organ transplant recipients in China are generally not told the identity of the organ donor, nor are they provided with evidence of written consent. In some cases even the identity of the medical staff and surgeons may be withheld from patients. The problem of transparency is compounded by the lack of any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethical</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guideline" title="Guideline">guidelines</a> for the transplant profession or system of discipline for surgeons who violate ethical standards.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-1"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>By the 1990s, growing concerns about possible abuses arising from coerced consent and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption" title="Corruption">corruption</a> led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning China's use of prisoner organs. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when a Chinese military doctor testified before U.S. Congress that he had taken part in organ extraction operations from executed prisoners, some of whom were not yet dead.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> In December 2005, China's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Family_Planning_Commission" title="National Health and Family Planning Commission">Deputy Health Minister</a> Huang Jiefu acknowledged that up to 95% of transplant organs from deceased donors, which make up 65% of all transplantations, came from executed prisoners and promised steps to prevent abuse.<sup id="cite_ref-CECC2006_18-0"><a href="#cite_note-CECC2006-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Huang reiterated these claims in 2008 and 2010, stating that over 90% of organ transplants from deceased donors are sourced from prisoners.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> In 2006 the World Medical Association demanded that China cease harvesting organs from prisoners, who are not deemed able to properly consent.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> In 2014, Huang Jiefu said that reliance on organ harvesting from death row inmates was declining, while simultaneously defending the practice of using prisoners’ organs in the transplantation system.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>
</p><p>In addition to sourcing organs from death-row inmates, international observers and researchers have also expressed concern that prisoners of conscience are killed to supply the organ transplant industry.<sup id="cite_ref-Editorial_26-0"><a href="#cite_note-Editorial-26">[26]</a></sup> These individuals were not convicted of capital crimes, and in many cases were imprisoned extrajudicially on the basis of their political or religious beliefs.

<p>The first allegations of large-scale organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners were made in March 2006 by three individuals claiming knowledge of involuntary organ extractions at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sujiatun_Thrombosis_Hospital" title="Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital">Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenyang" title="Shenyang">Shenyang</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoning" title="Liaoning">Liaoning</a> province. One of the whistleblowers, the wife of a surgeon at the hospital, claimed her husband had performed numerous operations to remove the corneas of Falun Gong practitioners for transplant.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-2"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-epoch2_37-0"><a href="#cite_note-epoch2-37">[37]</a></sup>
</p><p>Representatives of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._State_Department" title="U.S. State Department">U.S. State Department</a> were dispatched to the Sujiatun hospital to investigate the claims.

<p>David Kilgour and David Matas released the results of their preliminary investigation on 20 July 2006, in a report titled <i>"Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China"</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> Although the pair were denied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa" title="Travel visa">visas</a> to travel to China, they nonetheless compiled over 30 distinct strands of evidence which were consistent with allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners. These included an analysis of statistics on organ transplantation in China, interviews with former Falun Gong prisoners, and recorded admissions from Chinese hospitals and law enforcement offices about the availability of Falun Gong practitioners’ organs.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-3"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup>

<p>In the absence of evidence that would invalidate the organ harvesting allegations—such as a Chinese government registry showing the source of transplant organs— Kilgour and Matas concluded that the Chinese government and its agencies “have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience. Their vital organs, including kidneys, livers, corneas and hearts, were seized involuntarily for sale at high prices, sometimes to foreigners, who normally face long waits for voluntary donations of such organs in their home countries.” They estimated that from 2000 to 2005, the source for 41,500 organ transplants was unexplained, and that Falun Gong prisoners were the most plausible source for these organs.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-4"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> The authors qualified their report by noting the inherent difficulties in verifying the alleged crimes: no independent organizations are allowed to investigate conditions in China, eyewitness evidence is difficult to obtain, and official information about both organ transplantation and executions is often withheld or is contradictory.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-5"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 2007, Kilgour and Matas presented an updated report under the title "<i>Bloody Harvest: Revised Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China</i>". The findings were subsequently rewritten as a book released in October 2009.<sup id="cite_ref-washingtontimes.com_43-0"><a href="#cite_note-washingtontimes.com-43">[43]</a></sup> The reports received international media coverage, and the authors travelled internationally to present their findings to governments and other concerned organizations.

<p>Ethan Gutmann, an investigative journalist and author specializing in China, initiated his own investigation into the allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in 2006. Over the span of several years, he conducted interviews with over 100 refugees from China's labor camp and prison system, as well as with Chinese law enforcement personnel and medical professionals.<sup id="cite_ref-GutmannTestimony_55-0"><a href="#cite_note-GutmannTestimony-55">[55]</a></sup> Based on his research, Gutmann concluded that organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience became prevalent in the northwestern province of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang" title="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a> during the 1990s, when members of the Uyghur ethnic group were targeted in security crackdowns and “strike hard campaigns.”<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Enver Tohti, an exiled pro-Uyghur independence activist, claims to have carried out the first live organ transplant on a Uyghur Muslim prisoner in 1995. He said that the first time he performed the transplant procedure, he was taken to a room near the execution ground in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urumqi" title="Urumqi">Urumqi</a> to remove the liver and kidneys of an executed prisoner. He claimed that the man's heart was still beating as he removed the liver and kidneys.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup>
</p><p>By 1999, Gutmann says that organ harvesting in Xinjiang began to decline precipitously, just as overall rates of organ transplantation nationwide were rising. The same year, the Chinese government launched a nationwide suppression of the Falun Gong spiritual group. Gutmann suggests that the new Falun Gong prisoner population overtook Uyghurs as a major source of organs.<sup id="cite_ref-Slaughter_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Slaughter-2">[2]</a></sup> He estimated that approximately 65,000 Falun Gong practitioners had been killed for their organs between 2000 and 2008, and notes that this figure is similar to that produced by Kilgour and Matas when adjusted to cover the same time period.<sup id="cite_ref-Slaughter_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-Slaughter-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-inFocus_59-0"><a href="#cite_note-inFocus-59">[59]</a></sup>

<p>Several distinct strands of evidence have been presented to support allegations that Falun Gong practitioners have been killed for their organs in China. Researchers, human rights advocates and medical advocacy groups have focused in particular on the volume of organ transplants performed in China; the disparity between the number of transplants and known sources of organs; the significant growth in the transplant industry coinciding with the mass imprisonment of Falun Gong practitioners; short wait times that suggest an “on demand” execution schedule; and reports that Falun Gong prisoners are given medical exams in custody to assess their candidacy as organ suppliers.

<p>The number of organ transplants performed in China grew rapidly beginning in 2000. This timeframe corresponds with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong, when tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners were being sent to Chinese labor camps, detention centers and prisons.<sup id="cite_ref-urltbinternet.ohchr.org_63-0"><a href="#cite_note-urltbinternet.ohchr.org-63">[63]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-urlwww.falunhr.org_64-0"><a href="#cite_note-urlwww.falunhr.org-64">[64]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1998, the country reported 3,596 kidney transplants annually. By 2005, that number had risen to approximately 10,000.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-6"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup> The number of facilities performing kidney transplants increased from 106 to 368 between 2001 and 2005. Similarly, from 1999 to 2006, the number of liver transplantation centers in China rose from 22 to over 500.<sup id="cite_ref-ChinaDaily_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-ChinaDaily-4">[4]</a></sup> The volume of transplants performed in these centers also increased substantially in this period. One hospital reported on its website that it performed 9 liver transplants in 1998, but completed 647 liver transplants in four months in 2005. The Jiaotong University Hospital in Shanghai recorded seven liver transplants in 2001, 53 in 2002, 105 in 2003, 144 in 2004, and 147 in 2005.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-7"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>Kilgour and Matas write that the increase in organ transplants cannot be entirely attributed to improvements in transplant technology: “kidney transplant technology was fully developed in China long before the persecution of Falun Gong began. Yet kidney transplants shot up, more than doubling once the persecution of Falun Gong started...Nowhere have transplants jumped so significantly with the same number of donors simply because of a change in technology.”<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-8"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>Furthermore, they note that during this period of rapid expansion in China's organ transplant industry, there were no significant improvements to the voluntary organ donation or allocation system, and the supply of death row inmates as donors also did not increase.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-9"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Editorial_26-1"><a href="#cite_note-Editorial-26">[26]</a></sup> Although it does not prove the allegations, the parallel between rapid growth in organ transplants and the mass imprisonment of Falun Gong practitioners is consistent with the hypothesis that Falun Gong practitioners in custody were having their organs harvested.

<p>Chinese officials reported in 2005 that up to 95% of organ transplants are sourced from prisoners.<sup id="cite_ref-CECC2006_18-1"><a href="#cite_note-CECC2006-18">[18]</a></sup> However, China does not perform enough legal executions to account for the large number of transplants that are performed, and voluntary donations are exceedingly rare (only 130 people registered as voluntary organ donors nationwide from 2003 to 2009<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup>).
</p><p>In 2006, the number of individuals sentenced to death and executed was far fewer than the number of transplants. Based on publicly available reports, Amnesty International documented 1,770 executions in 2006; high-end estimates put the figure closer to 8,000.<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> Because China lacks an organized organ matching and allocation system, and in order to satisfy expectations for very short wait times, it is rare that multiple organs are harvested from the same donor. Moreover, many death row inmates have health conditions such as hepatitis B that would frequently disqualify them as organ donors. This suggests the existence of a secondary source for organs.<sup id="cite_ref-stateorgansMatas_16-1"><a href="#cite_note-stateorgansMatas-16">[16]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Special_Rapporteur" title="United Nations Special Rapporteur">United Nations Special Rapporteur</a> on Torture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Nowak" title="Manfred Nowak">Manfred Nowak</a> says “the explanation that most of these organs come from death row inmates is inconclusive...If so, the number of executed felons must then be much higher as so far assumed.”<sup id="cite_ref-Nowakinterview_66-0"><a href="#cite_note-Nowakinterview-66">[66]</a></sup>
</p><p>In a statement before the U.S. House of Representatives, Damon Noto said “the prisoners sentenced to death cannot fully account for all the transplantations that are taking place in China [...] Even if they executed 10,000 and transplanted 10,000 a year, there would still be a very large discrepancy. Why is that? It is simply impossible that those 10,000 people executed would match perfectly the 10,000 people that needed the organs.”<sup id="cite_ref-Noto_67-0"><a href="#cite_note-Noto-67">[67]</a></sup> David Kilgour and David Matas similarly write that traditional sources of transplants such as executed prisoners, donors, and the brain dead "come nowhere near to explaining the total number of transplants across China." Like Noto, they point to the large number of Falun Gong practitioners in the labor camp and prison system as a likely alternative source for organs.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-10"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup>

<p>Wait periods for organ transplants in China are significantly shorter than elsewhere in the world. According to a 2006 post on the China International Transplantation Assistance Center website, "it may take only one month to receive a liver transplantation, the maximum waiting time being two months. As for the kidney transplantation, it may take one week to find a suitable donor, the maximum time being one month...If something wrong with the donor's organ happens, the patient will have the option to be offered another organ donor and have the operation again in one week."<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> Other organ transplant centers similarly advertised average wait times of one or two weeks for liver and kidney transplants.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-11"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-TheEthics_70-0"><a href="#cite_note-TheEthics-70">[70]</a></sup> This is consistent with accounts of organ transplant recipients, who report receiving organs a matter of days or weeks.<sup id="cite_ref-DavidMcNeill_10-1"><a href="#cite_note-DavidMcNeill-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Harefuah2006_71-0"><a href="#cite_note-Harefuah2006-71">[71]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> By comparison, median wait times for a kidney in developed countries such as the United States, Canada and Great Britain typically range from two years to over four years, despite the fact that these countries have millions of registered organ donors and established systems of organ matching and allocation.<sup id="cite_ref-Walker_73-0"><a href="#cite_note-Walker-73">[73]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-canadawaitingtime_75-0"><a href="#cite_note-canadawaitingtime-75">[75]</a></sup>
</p><p>Researchers and medical professionals have expressed concern about the implications of the short organ transplant wait times offered by Chinese hospitals. Specifically, they say these wait times are indicative of a pool of living donors whose organs can be removed on demand.<sup id="cite_ref-Editorial_26-2"><a href="#cite_note-Editorial-26">[26]</a></sup> This is because organs must be transplanted immediately after death, or must be taken from a living donor (kidneys must be transplanted within 24–48 hours; livers within 12 hours, and hearts within 8 hours).<sup id="cite_ref-Allison_76-0"><a href="#cite_note-Allison-76">[76]</a></sup>
</p><p>Kirk C. Allison, Associate Director of the Program in Human Rights and Medicine at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota" title="University of Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>, wrote that the "short time frame of an on-demand system [as in China] requires a large pool of donors pre-typed for blood group and HLA matching," which is consistent with reports of Falun Gong prisoners having blood and tissue tested in custody. He wrote that China's short organ wait times could not be assured on a “random death” basis, and that physicians he queried about the matter indicated that they were selecting live prisoners to ensure quality and compatibility.<sup id="cite_ref-Allison_76-1"><a href="#cite_note-Allison-76">[76]</a></sup> Dr. Jacob Lavee, Director of the Heart Transplant Unit at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel, recounts one of his patients traveling to China for a heart transplant. The patient waited two weeks for a heart, and the surgery was scheduled in advance—meaning the organ could not have been procured on the basis of a random death.<sup id="cite_ref-StateorgansLavee_77-0"><a href="#cite_note-StateorgansLavee-77">[77]</a></sup> Franz Immer, chairman of the Swiss National Foundation for organ donation and transplantation, reports that during a visit to Beijing in 2007, he was invited by his Chinese hosts to observe a heart transplantation operation: “The organizer asked us whether we would like to have the transplantation operation in the morning or in the afternoon. This means that the donor would die, or be killed, at a given time, at the convenience of the visitors. I refused to participate.”<sup id="cite_ref-Slaughter_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-Slaughter-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Editors of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Clinical_Investigation" title="Journal of Clinical Investigation">Journal of Clinical Investigation</a> write that “The only way to guarantee transplant of a liver or heart during the relatively short time period that a transplant tourist is in China is to quickly obtain the requisite medical information from prospective recipients, find matches among them, and then execute a person who is a suitable match.”<sup id="cite_ref-Editorial_26-3"><a href="#cite_note-Editorial-26">[26]</a></sup> Noto similarly says that China's organ transplant wait times and the ability to schedule transplants in advance can only be achieved by having a large supply of “living donors that are available on demand.” Death row inmates alone are not numerous enough to meet this demand.<sup id="cite_ref-Noto_67-1"><a href="#cite_note-Noto-67">[67]</a></sup>

</p><p>The large numbers of Falun Gong prisoners in custody has led researchers to identify them as a likely source for organs. According to Gutmann's research, other marginalized prisoner groups may also have been targeted, including ethnic Tibetans and Uyghurs who reside predominantly in China's western regions. However, for reasons of geographic proximity, Falun Gong practitioners are more likely to be targeted. In addition, because their spiritual practice prohibits smoking or consumption of alcohol, they tend to be comparatively healthy.<sup id="cite_ref-Slaughter_2-4"><a href="#cite_note-Slaughter-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>In the context of organ harvesting Kilgour and Matas point to a further source of vulnerability. Namely, in order to protect family members from punishment by security agencies, many detained Falun Gong practitioners refuse to give their names or other personally identifying information to police. “Though this refusal to identify themselves was done for protection purposes, it may have had the opposite effect. It is easier to victimize a person whose whereabouts is unknown to family members than a person whose location the family knows,” says their report. Kilgour and Matas wrote that they had yet to meet or hear of any Falun Gong practitioners who were safely released from custody after refusing to identify themselves, despite the prevalence of this practice.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-12"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup> Similarly, Ethan Gutmann reports that in over a hundred interviews with former prisoners, he encountered only one Falun Gong practitioner who had remained nameless while in custody, and “her organs were even more worn out than my own.”<sup id="cite_ref-Slaughter_2-5"><a href="#cite_note-Slaughter-2">[2]</a></sup>

<p>Ethan Gutmann interviewed dozens of former Chinese prisoners, including sixteen Falun Gong practitioners who recalled undergoing unusual medical tests while in detention.

They had large quantities of blood drawn, in addition to urine samples, abdominal x-rays, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiogram" title="Electrocardiogram">electrocardiogram</a>. Hospital staff did not tend to physical injuries they had suffered in custody. This pattern was repeated in several other interviews. Qu Yangyao, a 30-something Chinese refugee, was taken from a labor camp to a hospital in 2000 along with two other Falun Gong practitioners. She says that hospital staff drew large volumes of blood, conducted chest x-rays and probed the prisoners’ organs. There was “no hammer on the knee, no feeling for lymph nodes, no examination of ears or mouth or genitals—the doctor checked her retail organs and nothing else,” writes Gutmann.<sup id="cite_ref-Slaughter_2-6"><a href="#cite_note-Slaughter-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Another woman, Jung Tian, recounts comprehensive physical exams and the extraction of large volumes of blood—enough for advanced diagnostics or tissue matching—while in a detention center in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenyang" title="Shenyang">Shenyang</a> city. At a women's labor camp in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong" title="Guangdong">Guangdong</a> province, a former detainee says that 180 Falun Gong prisoners were subject to medical tests in early 2003 and that the tests exclusively focused on internal organs. Another female witness who was held at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanjia_Labor_Camp" title="Masanjia Labor Camp">Masanjia Labor Camp</a> in 2005 said that only young, healthy practitioners had comprehensive medical exams upon arrival at the camp; the old and infirm were given only cursory treatment.<sup id="cite_ref-Slaughter_2-7"><a href="#cite_note-Slaughter-2">[2]</a></sup>

<p>In March 2006, immediately after allegations emerged that Falun Gong prisoners were being targeted for organ harvesting, overseas investigators began placing phone calls to Chinese hospitals and police detention centers. The callers posed as prospective transplant recipients or organ brokers and inquired about the availability of Falun Gong organs. In several instances, they obtained recorded admissions that organs could be procured from Falun Gong prisoners. A selection of these conversations were cited as evidence in the report by David Kilgour and David Matas.<sup id="cite_ref-Slaughter_2-9"><a href="#cite_note-Slaughter-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-13"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>In one such call to a police detention center in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishan" title="Mishan">Mishan</a> city, an official said that they had five to eight Falun Gong practitioners under the age of 40 who were potential organ suppliers. When asked for details on the background of these individuals, the official indicated that they were male Falun Gong prisoners from rural areas.<sup id="cite_ref-bh-admissions_88-0"><a href="#cite_note-bh-admissions-88">[88]</a></sup>
</p><p>A doctor at the Minzu hospital in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanning" title="Nanning">Nanning</a> city said that the hospital did not currently have Falun Gong organs available, but that he had previously selected Falun Gong prisoners for organ harvesting. The doctor also advised the caller to contact a university hospital in neighboring Guangdong province, saying that they had better channels to obtain Falun Gong organs.<sup id="cite_ref-bh-admissions_88-1"><a href="#cite_note-bh-admissions-88">[88]</a></sup> At the Zhongshan hospital in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, a doctor told investigators that all his hospital's organs were sourced from Falun Gong practitioners. During an April 2006 phone call to a military hospital in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, a doctor told investigators that he had "several batches" of Falun Gong organs, but that the supply could run dry after 20 May 2006. In another call, investigators posed as an organ broker to call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinzhou" title="Jinzhou">Jinzhou</a> city people's court. In response to a question about obtaining organs from Falun Gong prisoners, a court official said "that depends on your qualifications ... If you have good qualifications, we may still provide some [organs]."<sup id="cite_ref-bh-admissions_88-2"><a href="#cite_note-bh-admissions-88">[88]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Kilgour and Matas concede that in at least some instances, the hospital staff may have been supplying answers that the callers wanted to hear in order to make a sale. The results of these phone calls would also be difficult to replicate; as allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong gained attention, hospitals would become more reluctant to candidly discuss their organ sourcing practices.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-14"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>This investigative tactic was revived in 2012, when Communist Party officials began investigating Politburo member <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Xilai" title="Bo Xilai">Bo Xilai</a> for a variety of crimes. Bo had previously been governor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoning" title="Liaoning">Liaoning</a> province, which researchers believe was a major center for organ harvesting. The “World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong” made phone calls to mid- and high-level officials with prior connections to Bo, posing as members of the internal Communist Party discipline and inspection group that was building the case against him. They asked questions about the chain of command involved in procuring organs from prisoners, including Falun Gong prisoners. When asked about Bo Xilai's involvement in organ harvesting, one high-ranking member of the Politburo reportedly told investigators that Politburo Standing Committee member and security czar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Yongkang" title="Zhou Yongkang">Zhou Yongkang</a> "is in charge of this specifically. He knows it."<sup id="cite_ref-bitter_89-0"><a href="#cite_note-bitter-89">[89]</a></sup>
</p><p>A city-level official in Liaoning province was asked by investigators what direction Bo Xilai may have given regarding removing organs from Falun Gong prisoners. The official replied "I was asked to take care of this task. Party central is actually taking care of this...He [Bo] was involved quite positively, yeah it seemed quite positive. At that time we mainly talked about it during the meetings within the Standing Committee." The official hung up after realizing that he had not confirmed the identity of the caller.<sup id="cite_ref-bitter_89-1"><a href="#cite_note-bitter-89">[89]</a></sup> Another phone call recipient was a medical doctor at a military hospital in Liaoning. When asked about whether Falun Gong practitioners’ organs were ever used in transplant operations at a nearby hospital, the official answered in the affirmative: "All that was processed through the court." The doctor soon grew uncomfortable with the line of questioning and refused to discuss the issue further without clearance from the hospital's political division.<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>

<p>Human rights researchers and medical practitioners have argued that the commercial nature of the organ trade in China promotes corruption and abuse. Namely, the profits to be made from selling organs may lead to more killings—both court-sanctioned and extrajudicial—than would otherwise occur. Although this argument is not specific to the Falun Gong practitioners, it has been used as circumstantial evidence to support claims that Falun Gong prisoners could be targeted for organ harvesting.
</p><p>The growth of a commercial organ trade is linked to economic reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s that saw a steep decline in government funding to the healthcare system. Healthcare moved toward a more market-driven model, and hospitals devised new ways to grow their revenue. This pattern also applies to military hospitals; since the mid-1980s, the People's Liberation Army has engaged in commercial and profit-making ventures to supplement its budget.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-15"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Noto_67-2"><a href="#cite_note-Noto-67">[67]</a></sup>
</p><p>In their report on organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners, Kilgour and Matas describe transplant hospitals in China that cater to wealthy foreigners who paid upwards of $100,000 for liver, lung, and heart transplants. For instance, the website of the China International Transplantation Network Assistance Center posted the following price list on its website in 2006: Kidney: $62,000; Liver: $98,000–130,000; Liver+kidney: $160,000–180,000; Kidney+pancreas: $150,000; Lung: $150,000–170,000; Heart: $130,000–160,000; Cornea: $30,000.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-16"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup> In a statement before the U.S. House of Representatives, Gabriel Danovitch of the UCLA Medical Center said, “The ease in which these organs can be obtained and the manner that they may be allocated to wealthy foreigners has engendered a culture of corruption.”<sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup>

<p>In his book on organ transplant abuse, Ethan Gutmann included a case study centered on China's northeastern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoning" title="Liaoning">Liaoning</a> province. Former Politburo member Bo Xilai served as mayor and party chief of Dalian city, Liaoning in the 1990s, and later was made Governor from 2001 to 2004. The province is known to have a high concentration of Falun Gong practitioners, and leads the country in reported Falun Gong deaths in custody.<sup id="cite_ref-Slaughter_2-10"><a href="#cite_note-Slaughter-2">[2]</a></sup> Several observers have noted that Bo Xilai pursued an especially intense campaign against Falun Gong in the province, leading to charges of torture and crimes against humanity.<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-moore20120315irishindie_93-0"><a href="#cite_note-moore20120315irishindie-93">[93]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup>
</p><p>Bo's close associate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Lijun" title="Wang Lijun">Wang Lijun</a> was named head of the Public Security Bureau in Jinzhou, Liaoning, in 2003. In this capacity, he ran an organ transplantation facility where he reportedly oversaw “several thousand” organ transplants, leading to concerns that many of the organs were taken from political prisoners.<sup id="cite_ref-Bioethics_95-0"><a href="#cite_note-Bioethics-95">[95]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-TransplantInternational_96-0"><a href="#cite_note-TransplantInternational-96">[96]</a></sup> During a 2006 award ceremony, Wang told reporters “For a veteran policeman, to see someone executed and within minutes to see the transformation in which this person’s life was extended in the bodies of several other people—it was soul-stirring.”<sup id="cite_ref-bitter_89-2"><a href="#cite_note-bitter-89">[89]</a></sup>
Gutmann says it is “extremely unlikely” that all the organs used in these operations were taken from executed death-row prisoners, who would not have been plentiful enough to supply thousands of organ transplants. However, Gutmann notes that Liaoning detained large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners in labor camps and prisons. “It is also germane that both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Xilai" title="Bo Xilai">Bo Xilai</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Lijun" title="Wang Lijun">Wang Lijun</a> built a large measure of their political power on the repression of Falun Gong,” he writes.<sup id="cite_ref-Slaughter_2-11"><a href="#cite_note-Slaughter-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-bitter_89-3"><a href="#cite_note-bitter-89">[89]</a></sup>
</p><p>Dr. Huige Li, a spokesperson with the medical advocacy group Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting, reiterated this point in his 2015 testimony before European Parliament. By Li's calculations, a city the size of Jinzhou could be expected to perform roughly 14 legally sanctioned executions in the time period in question, meaning that the source for thousands of transplant operations at the centre was unaccounted for.<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup>
In addition to organ transplants in Jinzhou, Gutmann notes that security agencies in Dalian city were supplying human cadavers to two major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastination" title="Plastination">plastination</a> factories, where the bodies are filled with plastics to be sent on display around the world as bodies exhibitions. According to an informant interviewed on the program 20/20, the plastinated cadavers came from executed prisoners. Again, however, Gutmann notes a disparity in the numbers: the body plastination factories operating in Dalian processed thousands of cadavers—far more than could be expected to be donated or taken from legally executed prisoners. The establishment of the body plastination factories coincided with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong.<sup id="cite_ref-Slaughter_2-12"><a href="#cite_note-Slaughter-2">[2]</a></sup>

<p>The Chinese government has repeatedly and categorically denied that Falun Gong practitioners have been killed for their organs, and insists that it adheres to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> standards. Specifically, the government claims that one of the major sources for the transplant figures, Professor Shi Bingyi, later alleged that the Canadian led investigative reports quoting him were fabricated.<sup id="cite_ref-urlwww.falunhr.org_64-1"><a href="#cite_note-urlwww.falunhr.org-64">[64]</a></sup> However, the government has not refuted the specific points of evidence cited by researchers, nor provided an alternative explanation for the source of organs used in transplants.<sup id="cite_ref-UNAddendum1_99-0"><a href="#cite_note-UNAddendum1-99">[99]</a></sup>
</p><p>In response to a 2014 resolution on organ harvesting by the U.S. House of Representatives, a Chinese embassy spokesperson said that China requires written consent from organ donors, and declared that "the so-called organ harvesting from death-row prisoners is totally a lie fabricated by Falun Gong". The embassy representative then urged American lawmakers to stop "supporting and conniving" with Falun Gong.<sup id="cite_ref-Pennington_100-0"><a href="#cite_note-Pennington-100">[100]</a></sup>
</p><p>David Kilgour and David Matas say that the Chinese government's response to their investigation in 2006 contained "a good deal of invective, but no factual information which contradicts or undermines our conclusions or analysis". In particular, the Chinese government response centered on the charge that Falun Gong is an "evil cult"; questioned the motives and independence of the researchers; and noted a captioning error where their report had mislabeled the location of two Chinese cities. The government's response also stated that China prohibits the sale of human organs and requires written consent of the donor—claims which Kilgour and Matas say are belied by the evidence.<sup id="cite_ref-bh_15-17"><a href="#cite_note-bh-15">[15]</a></sup>

<p>Allegations about organ harvesting from Falun Gong led to renewed focus on China's transplant practices by international medical authorities and professional associations.

It violates core ethical precepts of transplant medicine and medical ethics. Worse still, some of those who are killed may be prisoners whose 'crimes' involve no more than holding certain political or spiritual beliefs." The journal decided that it would no longer accept manuscripts on human organ transplantation "unless appropriate non-coerced consent of the donor is provided and substantiated".<sup id="cite_ref-Editorial_26-4"><a href="#cite_note-Editorial-26">[26]</a></sup> A similar decision was taken by the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Journal_of_Transplantation" title="American Journal of Transplantation">American Journal of Transplantation</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-AJT2011_107-0"><a href="#cite_note-AJT2011-107">[107]</a></sup>

The move was partly a response to an investigation in which Israeli authorities arrested several men involved in mediating transplants of Chinese prisoners’ organs for Israelis.

<p>In 2010, Spain implemented a law prohibiting its nationals from traveling abroad to obtain illegal organ transplants.

In the debate, Vice-chair of Foreign Affairs and International Development Subcommittee on International Human Rights (SDIR)  MP Ms. Cheryl Hardcastle mentioned that the numbers may actually be between 60,000 and 100,000 organ transplants per year. The principal victims of China's organ-harvesting industry was Falun Gong followers. China's organ-harvesting industry developed in tandem with its systematic repression of Falun Gong." She said: "Today is a profound anniversary marking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_Convention" title="Genocide Convention">the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> 70 years ago.
