<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you follow Gamefromscratch on Twitter, you may have already <a href="https://twitter.com/gamefromscratch/status/1265105083106295814">seen this tweet</a> I put out last night about a blackmail demand that was made against our YouTube channel:</p><p><a href="https://www.gamefromscratch.com/image.axd?picture=image_3508.png"><img width="804" height="1052" title="image" alt="image" src="https://www.gamefromscratch.com/image.axd?picture=image_thumb_3474.png"></a></p><p>First off, I really want to give a gigantic shout out to all of the people that helped get the message out, the tweets, retweets and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/gqojjn/game_from_scratch_channel_in_danger_because_of_a/">even Reddit post</a>.&nbsp; You are an amazing community and hopefully if we yell loud enough, YouTube will here and fix this!</p><p>Basically it started with a message in the <a href="https://www.gamefromscratch.com/images/discosmall.png">GFS Discord server</a> claiming to have taken down my Animate CC video.&nbsp; This video unfortunately has been taken down and reinstated 4 times in the last two months, this happened after YouTube turned up the bots responsibility due to Covid-19, so I had written it off as bots malfunctioning.&nbsp; Each time it was taken down, I appealed and it would be restored.&nbsp; After I didn’t pay the $50 in bitcoin, I started getting Circumvention of Technology notices for 3 of my videos.&nbsp; That ultimately resulted in a community strike and loss of access to my channel for a week (or until appealed).&nbsp; Thankfully those&nbsp; three takedowns were reversed in about 2 hours and channel privileges were restored.</p><p>Today I was just waiting for YouTube to restore my 2 year old Animate CC video… then to my shock, it was reviewed and found to be in violation!&nbsp; Even after multiple previous reviews, as you can see from these email snippets!</p><p><a href="https://www.gamefromscratch.com/image.axd?picture=YTEmailThread.jpg"><img width="904" height="1441" title="YTEmailThread" alt="YTEmailThread" src="https://www.gamefromscratch.com/image.axd?picture=YTEmailThread_thumb.jpg"></a></p><p>So that is where things stand now.&nbsp; My channel is back, 3 out of 4 of my videos are returned.&nbsp; Thing is, anyone that wants can do this exact same attack whenever they want.&nbsp; It was reported to YouTube and frankly they did nothing.&nbsp; Any YouTube creator you love can have their channel taken down by spamming Circumvention of Technology claims, and there really isn’t anything you can do about it.&nbsp; YouTube assumes your guilt and until the review clears you name, your video is down.&nbsp; As you can see from the above emails, your video doesn’t always come back.</p><p>The single biggest piece of advice I can give to any YouTube creator, make sure your content is mirrored on another network!&nbsp;&nbsp; After my Animate CC video was taken down the second time, I started <a href="https://lbry.tv/$/invite/@gamefromscratch:1">mirroring to Lbry.tv</a> and I recommend you do to!&nbsp; Thanks to mirroring to Lbry, my <a href="https://lbry.tv/@gamefromscratch:1/adobe-animate-cc-2019-released:c">Animate CC video lives on!</a>&nbsp; So if you want to try to spot the copyright circumvention YouTube reviewers “found”, you can!</p><p>Hopefully if we yell loud enough, YouTube will hear and creators will be protected from insanity like this in the future!&nbsp; You can learn much more in the <a href="https://youtu.be/DxBaOKvTtC8">video</a> below.&nbsp; Once again, thank you to everyone that helped amplify my voice, it was and is much appreciated!</p><p><div><p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DxBaOKvTtC8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p></div></p>
