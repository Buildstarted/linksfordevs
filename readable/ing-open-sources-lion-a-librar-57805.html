Lion aims to make your life a little bit easier, by taking the groundwork of feature complete, accessible, performant, and framework agnostic components out of your hands! Check out the repo at <a href="https://github.com/ing-bank/lion" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ing-bank/lion</a>.</p><p id="9c4e" data-selectable-paragraph="">As some of you may already know, ING has a long and rich history of building Web Components, starting out with the Polymer library, all the way up to the recently released LitElement.</p><p id="70ed" data-selectable-paragraph=""><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/ing-blog/ing-%EF%B8%8F-web-components-f52aacc71d7a">Need a refresher?</a> Web Components are a set of browser standards that allow us to write browser native, reusable, encapsulated, and modular components.</p><p id="82b3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Web Components standards have finally matured, and today, there are many ways to build and consume your Web Components, like: <a href="https://angular.io/guide/elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Angular Elements</a>, <a href="https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stencil</a>, <a href="https://vuejsdevelopers.com/2018/05/21/vue-js-web-component/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vue</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Svelte</a> and many, many more. And with the release of the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066767/microsoft-edge-chromium-new-browser-windows-mac-download-os" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chromium Edge</a>, this means that all major browsers support Web Components natively.</p><p id="1e57" data-selectable-paragraph="">So today, I‚Äôm happy to share with you all that ING is open-sourcing its own core library of Web Components: Lion! üéâ</p><p id="eb61" data-selectable-paragraph="">Imagine the following fictional scenario:</p><blockquote><p id="b17f" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Lea is a developer who works at Betatech, and is working on a new in-house application.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="16b0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Framework Agnostic</h2><p id="3999" data-selectable-paragraph="">Finding components is hard, and can lead to a lot of frustration.</p><blockquote><p id="3cc7" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Lea finds a perfect component for her use case, but unfortunately, it‚Äôs written in a specific JavaScript framework, and Betatech uses a different framework, so sadly she is not able to use it.</em></p></blockquote><p id="0e05" data-selectable-paragraph="">Additionally, companies have their own visual identities and overriding fully styled components to make them look like the companies identity, can sometimes be more work than start styling from scratch.</p><blockquote><p id="4059" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Lea finds a component that offers all the needed functionalities, however, it looks vastly different from Betatechs identity.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="f1cb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Customize Functionality</h2><p id="df27" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once you‚Äôve found your perfect component, at some point down the line you may discover that the component lacks some kind of functionality that you would like to achieve.</p><blockquote><p id="b618" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Lea decides to copy over the code of a component she found, and implement the feature herself, and as a result now has to maintain the entire component as well, which becomes an added burden to the project.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="e20c" data-selectable-paragraph="">Accessibility</h2><p id="ccbf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Your components should be usable by every kind of user. Accessibility is hard to get right, but an essential feature, additionally, accessibility issues can be impossible to fix at a later stage without breaking changes, so it is crucial to incorporate accessibility right from the start.</p><blockquote><p id="4962" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Somewhere down the line, Lea finds an accessibility issue with a component she found online. She can‚Äôt fix this issue in her code, so she asks the maintainers to help her out. They tell her they can‚Äôt fix it because they don‚Äôt want to do a breaking change.</em></p></blockquote><p id="376d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Or, alternatively</p><blockquote><p id="0357" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Lea writes her own component, and the accessibility issue is hard to fix because of the way she initially wrote her HTML structure, and will also lead to a breaking change.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="73bb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Summary</h2><p id="6479" data-selectable-paragraph="">Does Lea‚Äôs story feel relatable?</p><p id="7b1b" data-selectable-paragraph="">It highlights multiple common issues in modern web development:</p><ul><li id="0f56" data-selectable-paragraph="">Finding and adding a dependency is a big deal</li><li id="fff2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Picking something because of looks alone might not always be the best choice</li><li id="729f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Adjusting behavior or styling can be tough to maintain</li><li id="ab81" data-selectable-paragraph="">If a package is popular it doesn‚Äôt mean it has good accessibility or performance</li></ul><h2 id="eb85" data-selectable-paragraph="">What can we do to tackle these issues?</h2><ul><li id="f77e" data-selectable-paragraph="">ü§î Imagine having components that purely focus on functionality, and leave the design up to you</li><li id="4a66" data-selectable-paragraph="">ü§î Imagine that these components come with great accessibility and performance</li><li id="2d78" data-selectable-paragraph="">ü§î Imagine these components are highly extendable and flexible</li></ul><p id="2e3b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now stop imagining, and look at Lion ü¶Å</p><blockquote><p id="0c75" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>We want to bring the web forward ‚Äî one component at a time.</em></p></blockquote><p id="b24a" data-selectable-paragraph="">Lion is a white-label, open-source, framework-agnostic component library, and can be the foundation for your codified in-house Design System. Aligning on design and usability is already a tough challenge, with Lion, we hope to take some of the work out of your hands.</p><h2 id="1ff1" data-selectable-paragraph="">White Label</h2><p id="4324" data-selectable-paragraph="">Lion is a core package of white label Web Components. What this means is that the core components only consist of very minimal styling, yet has all the fundamental functionalities. White label products are often created so others can easily rebrand them with their own visual identity. This is great because it means that everyone can use the core functionalities of our components while bringing their own branding or Design System because surprisingly, not everyone loves orange.</p><p id="3da6" data-selectable-paragraph="">And this is exactly what we at ING do as well. Our very own ing-web components extend the Lion components and apply our own ING visual identity which mostly is a thin layer on top of Lion.</p><p id="ab9a" data-selectable-paragraph="">Check out the <a href="http://lion-web-components.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lion demo‚Äôs</a>. Looks plain, doesn‚Äôt it? And now compare Lion to ing-web:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*dsquV3Z-ERC_uxRwG23TJw.png?q=20" width="4879" height="4629" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="4879" height="4629" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">lion form vs ing-web form</figcaption></figure><h2 id="bf74" data-selectable-paragraph="">üéØ Focus</h2><p id="020e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Lion was designed with a focus on global usage and reusability in mind. And as such, the following features were incorporated right from the start:</p><ul><li id="60c9" data-selectable-paragraph="">‚ôªÔ∏è Reusability ‚Äî Our components are meant to be distributed and used on a global scale</li><li id="54d6" data-selectable-paragraph="">üöπ Accessibility ‚Äî Our components are meant to be accessible for everyone</li><li id="8b2c" data-selectable-paragraph="">üöÄ Performance ‚Äî Our components are meant to be small, performant and fast</li></ul><p id="1671" data-selectable-paragraph="">These features allow us to roll out our components globally and have a single point of truth. It ensures that everyone in ING has a solid set of building blocks to build their application with, and get up and running in no time.</p><h2 id="6fae" data-selectable-paragraph="">Lessons learned</h2><p id="a7f3" data-selectable-paragraph="">ING started using web components very early on, and Lion is not the first component library we built. So you may wonder, how are these components different from the previous generation?</p><p id="4a84" data-selectable-paragraph="">Lion is built from the ground up to allow for accessibility and extendability as we learned that these things are almost impossible to change/achieve at a later point in development. We‚Äôd like to highlight a few of the lessons learned while making Lion:</p><ul><li id="f7d3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Not everything has to be a Web Component, for certain functionality regular JavaScript is better.</li><li id="4dd5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Stay as close to native semantic HTML elements as possible.</li><li id="2cf8" data-selectable-paragraph="">Incorporate accessibility from the start.</li><li id="5ec4" data-selectable-paragraph="">Not everything needs to be in the shadow DOM, this is especially important for aria relations and accessibility.</li><li id="47c8" data-selectable-paragraph="">UI components are hard</li></ul><blockquote><p id="c843" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Everyone should use web components but not everyone should write them</em></p></blockquote><p id="f47b" data-selectable-paragraph="">‚Äî <a href="https://twitter.com/erikkroes" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Erik Kroes</a></p><h2 id="b858" data-selectable-paragraph="">Adopt Lion!</h2><p id="89c7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Lion can help you implement your Design System by providing a white-label, functional, accessible and performant foundation for your component library. All you need to do is bring your own design! So if your company is looking to codify your Design System, Lion makes a great base to start from.</p><p id="2170" data-selectable-paragraph="">Alternatively, you could use Lion to create a web component version of your favorite design systems, such as: <a href="https://bulma.io/expo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bulma</a>, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="https://material.io/design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Material</a>, <a href="https://boltdesignsystem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bolt</a>, <a href="https://demos.creative-tim.com/vue-argon-design-system/documentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Argon</a>, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tailwind</a>.</p><p id="9375" data-selectable-paragraph="">Additionally, the more users and contributors Lion has, the more stable the Lion base will become, which helps everyone who uses Lion.</p><h2 id="27e1" data-selectable-paragraph="">Contribute to Lion!</h2><p id="a34b" data-selectable-paragraph="">At the time of writing, Lion is still in beta phase. We‚Äôd love to have your feedback before going to a stable release, so: Do you like open source, and do you want to help Lion out? You can do so by:</p><ul><li id="3b58" data-selectable-paragraph="">Reporting/fixing issues</li><li id="099a" data-selectable-paragraph="">Working on a completely new component (start with an issue for discussion first)</li><li id="5029" data-selectable-paragraph="">Improving documentation</li><li id="d067" data-selectable-paragraph="">‚Ä¶ every contribution counts! Even typo fixes in the docs ü§ì</li></ul><p id="a250" data-selectable-paragraph="">Feel free to create a github issue for any feedback or questions you might have. You can also find us on the Polymer slack in the <a href="https://polymer.slack.com/messages/CJGFWJN9J/convo/CE6D9DN05-1557486154.187100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#lion</a> channel.</p><p id="e0a2" data-selectable-paragraph="">You can join the Polymer slack by visiting <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/slack-invite" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://www.polymer-project.org/slack-invite</a>.</p><p id="296d" data-selectable-paragraph="">You can use Lion as the base to implement your own codified Design System.</p><p id="816e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let see how Lea‚Äôs story would have panned out if she would have chosen Lion instead.</p><p id="24f1" data-selectable-paragraph="">First, install what you need</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="030b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Create an <code>lea-tabs</code> component by reusing the functionality of Lion. This gives Lea all the functionality and accessible core that she needs for her custom tabs component.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="c2af" data-selectable-paragraph="">Lea also wants to be able to style the tab and tab-panel according to Betatechs visual identity. In order to do so, she creates a <code>lea-tab-panel</code> component and a <code>lea-tab</code> component, which she can then fully style however she desires, and eventually place inside the <code>lea-tabs</code> component. You can see how Lea achieved this in the example down below.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="461b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Excellent! Lea can now use the tabs component like so:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="bf22" data-selectable-paragraph="">There we go, Lea‚Äôs component is already done, so let‚Äôs write some documentation. See the <a href="https://lion-web-components.netlify.com/?path=/docs/intro-tabs-example--default-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">live Lea tabs documentation page</a>. You can see the full code of <code>lea-tabs</code> <a href="https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/tree/master/demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Github</a>.</p><p id="fcc8" data-selectable-paragraph="">P.S.: Do note that Lea is now responsible for keeping the documentation of <code>lea-tabs</code> up to date herself, and improvements on Lion's documentation will not automatically be reflected on Lea's documentation.</p><h2 id="6cb0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Why Open Source?</h2><p id="7602" data-selectable-paragraph="">Component libraries are in huge demand. By open-sourcing our extendable components, we help people to <em>do your thing</em>, while reaping all the benefits from the open-source community. What‚Äôs more, is that any contribution made to Lion directly impacts and benefits every design system using it (including ing-web) on a global scale. This means we get the best of both worlds by helping people with our components, and getting valuable contributions from the community!</p><p id="953a" data-selectable-paragraph=""><a href="https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take a look at our repository!</a> and if you wanna stay up to date be sure to watch and/or star it ‚Äî there is no twitter (yet) but you can follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/daKmoR" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Thomas Allmer</a> ‚Äî hey there üëã</p><h2 id="07d6" data-selectable-paragraph="">But there‚Äôs more!</h2><p id="d40d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Building applications is hard, and sometimes, you need a little bit more than just the right component alone, but also things like: Validation, Forms, Overlays, Localization, etc. But fear not; Lion has got you covered!</p><p id="ae58" data-selectable-paragraph="">You can check them out in our <a href="http://lion-web-components.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">documentation</a>, and we‚Äôll go into more depth about Lion‚Äôs additional systems in future blog posts.</p><p id="b5fa" data-selectable-paragraph="">Finally, we‚Äôd like to close this announcement by saying a few thank yous:</p><p id="5e47" data-selectable-paragraph="">ING, for giving us the opportunity to work on this project, and make it great together with the open-source community.</p><p id="10c9" data-selectable-paragraph="">Everyone who has worked on Lion (especially the Lion team), including all the contributors (39 contributors and counting!).</p><p id="9f9b" data-selectable-paragraph="">And last but not least <a href="https://twitter.com/passle_" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pascal Schilp</a>, for turning my scribbles into a followable story.</p></div></div></section></div></div></div>
