<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="primary"><article><div><p>I’ve been reading lots more non-fiction books than normal. And I’m getting increasingly annoyed about footnotes<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>. Footnotes are a weird skeuomorph hangover from the days of printed text. I don’t think they are really suited to eBooks – but they seem to have come along for the ride into the future.</p><p>There are a few things that <em>really</em> annoy me from a usability point of view. Some of these are the fault of the author, some the publisher, some the eBook format<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup>, and some the reader app.</p><p>Firstly, what’s the point of a footnote? This is a rough and untested bit of user-storying…</p><ul><li>As a reader, I want to look up a reference to a quoted work. So that I can see if the author is being accurate.</li><li>As a reader, I want to know a little more about the subject being discussed. Because I’m interested in this specific topic</li><li>As a reader, I want to understand what a newly introduced term means. So that I can understand the rest of the book.</li></ul><p>But, there’s also another user, who often takes precedence:</p><ul><li>As an author, I want to show that I have done my research. So that critics can’t use that to question my credibility.</li><li>As an author, I want to add more details which don’t fit in the main body of the text. Because I hate deleting text and my editor told me to take it out.</li><li>As an author, I want to add an explanation for some jargon or terminology. So that readers unfamiliar with the subject don’t feel excluded.</li></ul><p>(This isn’t a thorough bit of user research. It’s just me noodling around. Feel free to add your own, well-researched, stories.)</p><h2>Types of footnotes</h2><p>In my experience, there are four types of footnote:</p><ol><li>A citation. Anything from something a bit useless like “(Smith 1984.)” to a fully semantic “<a href="https://galiadigital.co.uk/">Baucherel, Kate</a>, <q><cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2IEWpnC">Blockchain Hurricane</a></cite>.</q> Business Expert Press. <time datetime="2020-03-03">2020</time>“.</li><li>A long note. A diversion which, while interesting, is not relevant to the main argument. Think of it a bit like a Director’s Commentary on a  <abbr title="Digital Video Disc">DVD</abbr>.</li><li>A short note. Usually an explanation of an TLA<sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup> or technical term.</li><li>A comedy footnote<sup><a href="#note4">4</a></sup>.</li></ol><p>Here’s my problem / User Need – <em>how does a user know which type of footnote they are encountering?</em></p><h2>In the wild</h2><p>Let’s take an example. I’m currently reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2OVEYSW">“Race After Technology” by Ruha Benjamin”</a>. It’s an excellent book. But I am unsure <em>how</em> I am supposed to read it<sup><a href="#note7">7</a></sup>. (This criticism applies to most books I’ve read, but this is what I’m currently reading.)</p><p>In this example, I click on <sup><code>13</code></sup> and my ebook reader – <a href="https://koreader.rocks/">KOReader</a> displays a little pop-up at the bottom of the screen.<br>
<img src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Small-citation.png.webp" alt="A small citation at the bottom of the screen." width="360" height="360"></p><p><em>Before</em> I tap the link – I’ve <em>no</em> idea what’s behind it. And, that’s assuming that I know that reference numbers are tappable, and that the tap-target is large enough that I don’t accidentally interact with the book in some other way.</p><p>Here’s another, from the same page:<br>
<img src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Larger-note.png.webp" alt="Four lines of explanation at the bottom of the screen." width="360" height="360"><br>
Here the author provides a citation <em>and</em> some explanatory text. How does an author decide what goes in the body and what goes in the notes? How does the user know whether the footnote is a citation or is explanatory?</p><p>Finally, again from the same page, there’s this:<br>
<img src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-very-long-footnote.png.webp" alt="A very long footnote." width="360" height="360"><br>
This footnote is so long that the UI pop-up isn’t big enough to contain it and displays a scrollbar.</p><p>Again, this isn’t a criticism of this specific author. This happens on lots of books. The publishing industry seems to have a complete disregard for the user’s need.</p><p>How do users read? Do they want to click on every footnote link they encounter? Do they expect to read them at the end? Does having a mixture of notes and citations confuse them?</p><h2>Specification</h2><p>The <a href="http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/html/notes.html">ePub specification talks about how to handle footnotes</a>. One of the great things about ePub is that it is <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/epub-spec.html">based on HTML5</a>. The footnote markup is pretty simple:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;</span>
   In that year<span>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<span>"#ft2f"</span> <span>role</span>=<span>"doc-noteref"</span> <span>epub:type</span>=<span>"noteref"</span>&gt;</span>2<span>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</span> there were 67 mills engaged in the manufacture of cotton goods …
<span>&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>aside</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"ft2f"</span> <span>role</span>=<span>"doc-footnote"</span> <span>epub:type</span>=<span>"footnote"</span>&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;</span>
     2 The manufacturing statistics for 1900 which follow are not those given in the Twelfth Census, but are taken from the <span>&lt;<span>em</span>&gt;</span>Census of Manufactures<span>&lt;/<span>em</span>&gt;</span> …
   <span>&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>aside</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>Most eBook publishers also include a back-link, so that users can easily return to the main text.</p><p>The specification doesn’t say whether citations should be displayed differently to footnotes.</p><p>I guess it would be easy to add <code>class="citation"</code> and have the CSS <code>.citation::before {content="cite ";}</code></p><p>That would allow users to differentiate between <sup>cite 2</sup> and <sup>note 2</sup>.</p><h2>Usability</h2><p>There are some “technical” usability issues here.  How the user interacts with links, whether the note appears as a pop-up or inline, and the process of returning to the main text.</p><p>But I want to talk about the cognitive issues at play. When footnotes can contain anything from a citation to essential background information, the user is forced to break from the flow<sup><a href="#note8">8</a></sup> of reading – often in the middle of a sentence.  This is a problem in both paper books and electronic books.</p><p>I’m still stuck on the user needs. It seems to me that <em>most</em> footnotes are for the author’s benefit. If the text is that important, it should be in the main body. If it isn’t, leave it out.</p><p>Abbreviations can be dealt with inline using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr"><code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element</a>. You should be able to to tap on the <abbr title="Three Letter Abbreviation">TLA</abbr> to get the definition.</p><p>As for citations? Isn’t that what HTML links are for? Just link directly to the document in question as part of the running text.</p><p>Would it make life easier for reader to include a fully semantic citation inline? Take this scrap of imaginary text:</p><blockquote><p>

</code></pre><p>CSS could be used to show / hide various parts of the citation until interacted with. A reader familiar with hypertext should know that visiting a link will take them to an external site. No need for footnotes at all!</p><p>Obviously, I haven’t done any proper usability studies. Nor have I spoken to any users other than myself.</p><p>But surely we need a better way of making footnotes and citations better for readers?</p><h2>What’s next</h2><p>There have been many attempts to get a <code>&lt;footnote&gt;</code> element into HTML. I think there’s some value in adding semantic information to a document. But I <em>probably</em> think that the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite"><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element</a> are good enough.</p><p>Perhaps the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/">W3C Publishing Group</a> needs to fund some user research to see if ePub notes and citations work well for most users.</p><p>Perhaps authors need to realise that linear text is a relic of paper-based publishing and that hypertext affords new ways for a reader to journey through a text.</p><p>Or, perhaps, I need to learn how to read without getting distracted.</p><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><ol><li id="note1">The explanatory notes in a book which typically come at the end of a page. As digital documents don’t really have a concept of a page, the “footnotes” are often “endnotes”. That is, they come at the end of a chapter or document. I will be using the colloquial term “footnote” to refer to footnotes, endnotes, and citations.</li><li id="note2">I’ll mostly be talking about the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/epub-spec.html">ePub standard</a>, but it also goes for other formats.</li><li id="note3">A three-letter acronym (TLA), or three-letter abbreviation, is an abbreviation consisting of three letters.</li><li id="note4">The late, great author Terry Pratchett popularised the meme<sup><a href="#note5">5</a></sup> of extensive and tangential footnotes. Often with their own sub-footnotes<sup><a href="#note6">6</a></sup>.</li><li id="note5">Dawkins, Richard (1989), The Selfish Gene (2 ed.), Oxford University Press, p. 192, ISBN 978-0-19-286092-7</li><li id="note6">Not to be confused with “Super-Footnotes” which were a short-lived Superhero group in the “Action World” comics of 1985. The Super-Footnotes had the power of citation which they used to undermine dodgy claims by politicians. They appeared in 3 issues of the comic before disappearing. Their author, Alan Moore, has repeatedly claimed they’re his favourite heroes and has lobbied extensively for a Hollywood movie to be made of their adventures.</li><li id="note7">I’m quite serious here. I don’t read many “academic” books and I’m unsure of what my journey is <em>meant</em> to be like. Does the author expect me to follow every note? Or wait until the end of the chapter? Or something else?</li><li id="note8">In psychology, flow is the mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.
