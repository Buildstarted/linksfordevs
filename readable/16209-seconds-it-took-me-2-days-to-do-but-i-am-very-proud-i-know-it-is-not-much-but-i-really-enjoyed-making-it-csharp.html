It had a really basic BASIC interpreter on it with an 8 line LED display with something like 14 characters per row.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I just followed the book and made a program to ask you for a password before letting you pic some random number 1-10.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I thought I was a Wizard with magical powers at first.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Even when I got my first 386 when I wasn't much older than that and configured the sound blaster to talk on boot up.  I thought I was a Grand Wizard.  They were like magical black boxes to me and I was doing magic.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Fast forward 25 years and I basically know so much crap now it's boring, nothing is particularly challenging.  Computers were so interesting to me as a child that I spent my life sucking every ounce of wonder out of them that I possibly could.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Now it's kind of boring....  Build a login form, do SSO auth, make a searchbox, do a single page app, build a date picker, or w/e "yawn" and I can build computers from parts, and I can even write ASM and inject it into other applications and hook asm instructions etc etc.  Base 2, Base 10, Base 16, doesn't matter.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">/yawn</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Man, I wish I could go back to thinking they were magical black boxes.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Somehow, someway, I need to move on from web development and do something interesting, like programming drones, or arduinos, etc etc etc.  I've got arduinos, not particularly interesting either.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">What I think I really want to do is learn electrical engineering to the point that I understand electrical circuit diagrams and can design my own PCB's so I can move my arduino prototypes to something more concrete.  I understand the basics, I know what the core basic electrical components do and how to use them, I just need to learn more in terms of what an electrical engineering degree would teach you.</p></div></div></div></div>
