<p>What known vulnerabilities? So far this thread has not pointed to any in particular. I'm going to go look at those lectures <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/atoponce/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/atoponce">@atoponce</a> linked, maybe I'll find something more convincing in there. But at the moment, the closest I've seen to a vulnerability relies on twiddling bits to affect the decrypted file in predictable ways which should be very very hard. And the "doom principle" as far as I know requires an oracle of some kind to apply. Where Vim is used, you won't have that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's what <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/tarcieri/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/tarcieri">@tarcieri</a> pointed out:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not just using malleable, unauthenticated cryptography which is bad because of the very limited number of threats it protects against...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Authenticated cryptography (implemented "right") can protect against chosen ciphertext attacks, which includes at least one mode of bit flipping attacks.</p>
<p>The feasibility of these attacks against Vim has not been made clear yet.</p>
<p>In one attack mode, an attack requires the observation of some of the results of decrypting the chosen ciphertexts. In the attacks I know of, many such chosen ciphertext decryptions need to be observed.</p>
<p>AFAICT, the concern usually is that an ingenious attacker may be able to launch a chosen ciphertext attack by using Vim as a decryption oracle in a way that we do not expect. So for this reason we should add the additional security provided by authenticated cryptography (done "right") to protect against these attacks, even if we cannot imagine how they can be launched against Vim.</p>
<p>So no demonstrated exploit, but this is at the last line of defense. Difficult to say how strong that line is. No doubt it would be better to improve the defenses.</p>
<p>In another attack mode, the attacker has (partial) knowledge of the plaintext, and can craft a ciphertext that induces a malicious plaintext.</p>
<p>Exploits have been demonstrated for specific encryption modes (when authenticated encryption is done "wrong"). But the affected plaintext needs to be located in a specific position in the text.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting attack vector, and it may either lead to a quick and simple exploit, or not.</p>
<p>This is the most convincing argument given (by <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/atoponce/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/atoponce">@atoponce</a>) for using authenticated encryption (done "right") soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It's using a weak password-based key derivation algorithm which is vulnerable to brute force attacks</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The KDF is too fast, and this makes brute force attacks run faster.</p>
<p>To understand if this amounts to a currently feasible exploit, according to the best of our knowledge, we would need to know how fast a brute force attack would actually be in Vim's case (find out key length used in Vim and fastest achievable throughput for breaking attempts).</p>
<p>Also, it may play a role that Vim does not enforce that users use strong enough keys.</p>
<p>I believe nobody objected that the KDF should be changed.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It's using a cipher (Blowfish) whose creator does not recommend using it anymore: "At this point, though, I'm amazed it's still being used. If people ask, I recommend Twofish instead." -- Bruce Schneier</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Not a description of a vulnerability or an exploit.</p>
<p>But a newer crypto algorithm, designed by one of the leading experts in the field, no doubt with better defenses against the growing number of attacks, and recommended over one of that expert's older designs, of course means that Vim should probably move on and use one of the currently recommended algorithms (Twofish, AES, ...), at least as a better default.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It's using a cipher with a small block size (64-bits)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be exploited in cryptoanalysis: when more than 4GB of plaintext are encrypted with the same key, it becomes probable that two ciphertext blocks are identical, even if the corresponding plaintext blocks are different. This reveals some properties of the key.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It is 32GB of plaintext, not 4GB. (2^32 plaintext / ciphertext blocks, each with 64 bits = 8 bytes.)</p>
<p>Although I have not seen an exploit based on this, I have no doubt that a cryptoanalyst can create one.</p>
<p>An exploit would require more than one cipherblock collision. So a large number of cipherblocks needs to be intercepted and saved. Would be interesting to know how many.</p>
<p>The feasibility has not been demonstrated, but it only requires ciphertext interception, which is a probable attack scenario (as has been mentioned: saving files on shared or remote storage such as Dropbox, ...).  And with cipherblocks created on every write to the edited file or the swapfile or undofile during editing, more ciphertext may be created than we may think now.</p>
<p>To understand the feasibility of an exploit, we would need to quantify how much ciphertext would be needed for an exploit, and how much ciphertext would be generated by Vim usage scenarios (worst case, typical case).</p>
<p>Without a real feasibility analysis, just from a rough <em>guesstimate</em>, this seems to be the most urgent concern.  It is another reason to move on to a newer algorithm. Twofish and AES (and all other algorithms in the NIST AES contest) use 128 bit blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> 128 bit blocks require 2^64 * 128 bit = 256 EB of plaintext / ciphertext for a probable cipherblock collision.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It's using a cipher vulnerable to reflectively weak key attacks</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>AFAIU, a brute force key recovery attack (which does not require the participation of Vim) is feasible on any ciphertext that Vim encrypted with blowfish using one of the many weak keys.</p>
<p>The problem is to find out if a given encryption uses a weak key, so that the brute force attack becomes feasible. Finding this out still requires to use Vim as a sort of oracle in a chosen plaintext attack or a known plaintext attack, which uses many attempts.</p>
<p>To understand the urgency of this better, it would be interesting to know how probable the generation of a weak key is in Vim's case.</p>
<p>My <em>guess</em> is that this is less pressing than the block size problems, because the ratio of weak keys to good keys <em>may</em> be quite small, and because Vim still needs to be used as an oracle.</p>
<p>Still another good reason to use a more modern encryption.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It's using an on-disk format which is incompatible with anything except vim</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Not an exploit.</p>
<p>Interoperability is probably a concern for some people.</p>
<p>But one of the advantages of having a built-in text encryption / decryption facility is that this feature does not depend on the availability of an encryption library on the many platforms supported by Vim.</p>
<p>Vim can read and write its own encrypted texts on most or all flavors of Unix, Windows, Mac, VMS, BeOS, Amiga etc., out of the box.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, using an external encryption program means that swapfiles and undofiles need to be disabled for editing encrypted texts.  So this is not a full-featured alternative to built-in encryption or an encryption library.</p>
<p>But built-in encryption of course comes at the cost of maintaining the crypto implementation in Vim, which essentially needs to be done by a cryptology expert.</p>
<p>Also, it seems better to move on to more modern encryption algorithms. But maintaining more crypto code also takes more time and requires more expertise.</p>
<p>And when using a crypto library, Vim can benefit from audits that are done on the library (would need to check if that is actually done though).  It seems less likely that a crypto audit is done on the crypto code in Vim, but it is not impossible.</p>
<p>I am counting</p>
<ul>
<li>zero demonstrated exploits</li>
<li>one convincing argument for a possible threat (unauthenticated encryption -&gt; deterministic chosen ciphertext attack triggering a bug)</li>
<li>one seemingly urgent concern (block size) where the ratio of ciphertext required for an exploit to probably interceptable ciphertext <em>seems</em> to be small</li>
<li>three seemingly less urgent concerns, where either Vim needs to be used as a decryption oracle, or the workload for an attack still <em>seems</em> to be large, but these guesstimates should be corrected by quantification
<ul>
<li>unauthenticated encryption -&gt; chosen ciphertext attacks with oracle</li>
<li>fast KDF -&gt; faster brute forcing keys</li>
<li>chosen/known plaintext attack to detect weak keys -&gt; brute forcing weak keys</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More than enough urgency and concerns to move on to newer encryption algorithms.</p>
