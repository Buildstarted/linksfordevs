I personally have spent years studying and experimenting to gain the experience that I have. Any time I want to use a new framework or library it is still hard. It requires me to spend more time learning and experimenting again to be comfortable and confident to use it. As I've learnt more and more over the years I genuinely believe I've become better and faster at learning so hence it becomes easier.<br>Over the years, I think the challenges involved have changed. Some thing have become easier however new challenges have also been introduced. Overall however, I believe it is much easier now compared to when I started. I also think its less of a frustrating experience and I find it to be more enjoyable.<br>Having said all that, I think as an industry we can always continue to strive for better. I think its questions like this that highlight the challenges we face and inspire the need to continue improving the situation.</p><p>I want to be especially careful not advise you on choosing one solution over the other because I don't believe there is enough information for me to do so.<br>One of the biggest challenges I find with problem solving is identifying the actual problem being solved. It would be very easy to categorise this problem as needing to "build a website" however with so many solutions to choose from to "build a website" any one of them could potentially work. The problem needs to broken down as much as possible because this provides a criteria to evaluate the different solutions against.<br>Secondly, we all have personal preferences. You are entitled to your own, and no one can tell you what you prefer or feel more comfortable working with. This is entirely based on you.<br>Also, when others are involved, a team or a company, additional factors may need to be considered such as the teams preferences, as well as the companies policies and strategy.<br>These are just some of the factors involved that need to be taken into consideration when evaluating different solutions.</p><p>One final thing I would like to address is your message. I think it is not specific enough to understand what you are expecting from a response. In my interpretation, there are many different questions to which your are trying to get an answer for, as well as you providing your opinions. These are all valid and useful however when asked and raised together in one github issue, it is difficult to put together a clear and concise answer or begin a discussion to provide you with the answers you seek.<br>My suggestion to you would be to try again and be more specific with your questions or opinions. Don't worry about opening lots of issues, if they are well written and scoped they would be much better received and you are far more likely to get answers to your questions or directed appropriately.</p><p>I hope this response helps in some way. Just know that there are many individuals that are willing to help, however it is your responsibly to make it easy for someone to help you.</p></div></div></div></div>
