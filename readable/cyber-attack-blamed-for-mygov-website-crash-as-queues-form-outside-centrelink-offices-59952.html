  <p>The Federal Government says the MyGov website, which is used to access Centrelink services online, was hit by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) cyber attack this morning.</p><div>
<div>
  <h2>Key points:</h2><ul><li>People struggled to gain access to the MyGov website amid unprecedented demand</li><li>Lines outside Centrelink buildings have stretched around blocks</li><li>The Government urged people to be patient and apply online tomorrow</li></ul></div>
</div><p>The website crashed, and there were long lines outside Centrelink offices around the country, after the Federal Government announced it was closing down large parts of the economy in a bid to contain the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Government Services Minister Stuart Robert conceded MyGov had buckled under pressure under the twin impacts of the increased demand and the DDos attack.</p><p>"More than 55,000 Australians [were]&nbsp;trying to access [the site] at the same time,&nbsp;as well as the issue we had with the&nbsp;denial of service attack," he said.</p><p>A DDoS attack is where hackers flood a website with users so that the site becomes overloaded.</p><p>It's the type of attack that was used to bring down the Census website in 2016.</p><p>Demand for MyGov services has risen dramatically, with many Australians who have been stood down due to extra coronavirus restrictions seeking access to unemployment benefits.</p><p>From midday today thousands of businesses, including pubs, gyms and restaurants, have been told to close their doors.</p><p>The Government's $66 billion second-stage stimulus package includes a doubling of dole payments, as it seeks to cushion the economy from the devastating impact of the pandemic.</p><p>Queues outside some Centrelink offices stretched around the block this morning.</p><p>"There is unprecedented demand for the service right now, but Australians need to be patient. Try logging on later today or even tomorrow," Mr Robert said.</p><p>"MyGov is working, but the best option right now is for people to be patient."</p><p>In a statement, Centrelink confirmed it was experiencing "very high demand across all services" and urged people not to come into centres unless there was a "critical need" to be there.</p><p>Centrelink said new claims could be started online and if proof of ID was required, it could be provided over the phone if someone was in self-isolation.</p><p>However, people are being encouraged to defer their applications until later "if you can."</p><p>Gym worker Medhi Bachkat said he was trying to stay positive despite waiting for hours outside Centrelink at Surry Hills in Sydney this morning.</p><p>"I've gone from having an income to having no income in the last two weeks," he said.</p><p>"We still have to pay for our rent and our lifestyle, so I don't know what's going on.</p><p>"I'm not trying to be stressed or anything, but no-one's smiling or happy. Everyone's grumpy."</p><p>Cherie Grant, 26, and Rhiannon Stella, 21, both lost their hospitality jobs last night.</p><p>They arrived at Centrelink in Victoria Park in Perth an hour and a half before it opened. </p><p>"We don't have any second form of income so this is what we have to do," Ms Grant told the ABC.</p><p>Opposition frontbencher Bill Shorten said the unprecedented demand was "entirely foreseeable" and said Mr Robert must do better.</p><p>"He must ensure Centrelink services — online and in person — are working now when Australians need them most."</p><p>The Government's latest $66 billion stimulus package includes help for casual workers, sole traders, and small businesses.</p><p>Some asset tests for welfare payments are being waived.</p><p>Small businesses can apply for grants of up to $10,000, and the Jobseeker Payment is being doubled.</p><p>Taking into account the first round of stimulus measures, and <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-19/rba-cuts-interest-rates-coronavirus-covid-19/12070494" target="_self" title="">those announced by the Reserve Bank this week</a>, the total economic assistance package is now worth $189 billion, according to the Government.</p><p>That is equivalent to 9.7 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product.</p><p><strong>ABC/AAP</strong></p><div><div id="curious-embed"><div><div id="hearken-embed-module-5075-1a553"><div><p><label for="hearken-embed-module-5075-1a553-3"><span>Postcode</span></label></p><p><label><span><p>Please sign me up for the ABC Health newsletter</p></span></label></p><p><label><span><p>Please sign me up for the ABC NewsMail newsletter</p></span></label></p></div></div></div></div></div>
