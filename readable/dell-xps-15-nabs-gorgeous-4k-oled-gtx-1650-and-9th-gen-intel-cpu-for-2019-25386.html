This year Dell is keeping most of it the same, but the internal specs are getting a nice bump with 9th gen Intel, NVIDIA GTX 1650 graphics, and a new option for a 4K OLED display. The laptop was shown off at Computex 2019 and here is when you can get it."/>

<h2 id="monitor">Dell 27-inch UltraSharp U2717D monitor</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2018/04/dell-ultrasharp-u2717d.jpg?itok=IIU-X2W5" title=""><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/4x3.png" width="400" height="278" alt="" data-src="/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2018/04/dell-ultrasharp-u2717d.jpg?itok=IIU-X2W5"></a></p>

<p>The display on the XPS 15 is something to behold, but that doesn't mean you won't want to set up a workstation at home. This 27-inch UltraSharp monitor from Dell <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293383-12578053%3Fsid%3DUUwpUdUnU40853%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.dell.com%252Fen-us%252Fshop%252Faccessories%252Fapd%252F210-ahgv&amp;token=BKjhJUbv" title="" rel="nofollow">(about $480)</a> has a 2560 x 1440 resolution, a six-millisecond response time, and a 60Hz refresh rate. These are some seriously decent specs, enough so that we named it <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/best-27-inch-monitors">our pick for the best overall monitor this size</a>.</p>

<p>Plenty of ports, including HDMI, Mini DisplayPort, and USB 3.0 make connecting a breeze, and the stand lets you rotate, swivel, and turn so that you find a position that suits you and your desk.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293383-12578053%3Fsid%3DUUwpUdUnU40853%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.dell.com%252Fen-us%252Fshop%252Faccessories%252Fapd%252F210-ahgv&amp;token=BKjhJUbv" title="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">See at Dell</a></p>

<h2 id="dock">Plugable USB-C docking station</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2017/02/plugable-usbc-docking-01.jpg?itok=ukvqQ1TI" title="Plugable USB-C docking station"><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/9x16.png" width="400" height="645" alt="Plugable USB-C docking station" data-src="/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2017/02/plugable-usbc-docking-01.jpg?itok=ukvqQ1TI"></a></p>

<p>If you're going for the workstation route, including monitors, keyboards, and mice, you might want to grab this USB-C docking station from Plugable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Specific-Chromebook-Thunderbolt-Supported/dp/B076HXWR9M/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow">(about $129)</a>. For ports, it has two USB 3.0, two USB-C, Ethernet, HDMI, and two USB 2.0.</p>

<p>For a 4K monitor, expect to hit 30Hz — everything else should be able to hit 60Hz. All in all, this is an excellent docking station, even good enough to be awarded an Editor's Choice award by <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/349007/plugable-usb-c-docking-station-with-power-delivery">PCMag</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Specific-Chromebook-Thunderbolt-Supported/dp/B076HXWR9M/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2 id="webcam">Logitech C922x webcam</h2>

</div><p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2016/10/logitech-c922-tripod-hero.jpg?itok=EmzUsjca" title="Logitech C922x webcam"><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/4x3.png" width="800" height="600" alt="Logitech C922x webcam" data-src="/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2016/10/logitech-c922-tripod-hero.jpg?itok=EmzUsjca"></a></p><div>

<p>Hate the placement of the webcam on the XPS 15? You need an external webcam! Our choice for the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/best-webcam-windows">best overall webcam</a> out there, the C922x <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-C922x-Pro-Stream-Webcam/dp/B01LXCDPPK?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow">(about $92)</a> records 1080p video and streams 720p video at 60FPS. A clip lets you easily attach it to the top of your XPS 15's display, or you can set it up on a tripod.</p>

<p>Do you stream a lot? Smart removal of backgrounds makes it easy to ensure only you show up without the use of a greenscreen.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-C922x-Pro-Stream-Webcam/dp/B01LXCDPPK?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2 id="displayport">Plugable USB-C to DisplayPort adapter cable</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2017/06/plugable-usbc-hdmi-dp-adapter-01.jpg?itok=k-rb21jj" title="Plugable USB-C to DisplayPort adapter cable"><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/3x4.png" width="400" height="526" alt="Plugable USB-C to DisplayPort adapter cable" data-src="/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2017/06/plugable-usbc-hdmi-dp-adapter-01.jpg?itok=k-rb21jj"></a></p>

<p>The XPS 15's HDMI port is 1.4, so if you're planning on using an external 4K monitor, you'll only be able to hit a 30Hz refresh rate. Want 4K at 60Hz? Grab this Plugable USB-C cable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EXKDRAC?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow">(about $20)</a> that ends in either an HDMI or DisplayPort connector.</p>

<p>Thanks to the capabilities of Thunderbolt 3, you'll have no problem getting a clear, crisp picture on your external 4K monitor.</p>

<h2 id="peak">Peak Design Everyday Messenger laptop bag</h2>

</div><p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2016/06/peak-design-everyday-messenger.jpg?itok=XBW0CuFw" title="Peak Design Everyday Messenger"><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/4x3.png" width="800" height="528" alt="Peak Design Everyday Messenger" data-src="/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2016/06/peak-design-everyday-messenger.jpg?itok=XBW0CuFw"></a></p><div>

<p>Hand-picked by a couple of our Mobile Nations editors, the Peak Design Everyday Messenger <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Design-Everyday-Messenger-Charcoal/dp/B017KOK6IO?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow">(about $250)</a> truly lives up to its name. It's perfect for lugging your XPS 15 all around town, all day, every day.</p>

<p>This bag launched on Kickstarter and blew up into one of the best laptop bags money can buy. It's perfect for folks who need to carry their laptops, along with all of their cameras and chargers and phones and everything else. If you've just got your XPS 15 and a charger, then it might be just a tad much. But if you buy every accessory on this list, you'll need a bag that can keep up!</p>

<p>The strap looks like a padded seat belt, designed for maximum comfort and durability, while the outer shell is weatherproof, so no worries if you get caught in a sudden downpour.</p>

<h2 id="procase">ProCase laptop sleeve</h2>

</div><p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2016/06/procase-laptop-sleeve-press.jpg?itok=xH_8rhCU" title="ProCase laptop sleeve"><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/1x1.png" width="800" height="839" alt="ProCase laptop sleeve" data-src="/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2016/06/procase-laptop-sleeve-press.jpg?itok=xH_8rhCU"></a></p><div>

<p>Some folks don't need a full-on laptop bag. Maybe you keep your Dell XPS 15 in your backpack, but you still want to keep it protected. For that you'll want a sleeve — they're thin, light, and they'll at least help with light bumps and drops.</p>

<p>ProCase's sleeve <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ProCase-14-Protective-Ultrabook-Chromebook/dp/B017JHHO14/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow">(about $19)</a> is like a bag and sleeve in one, thanks to its extendable handle and fashionable design. It comes in light gray with turquoise trim, dark gray with orange trim, and teal with orange trim.</p>

<p>The inside is soft and padded, gently surrounding your XPS 15 and snugly protecting it, while the outside is a durable, textured material resembling denim but much lighter.</p>

<p>If you don't want a cumbersome laptop bag or if you'll be carrying your XPS 15 in a bag with items that might scratch its surface, then a sleeve is a good call, and the ProCase sleeve is the best.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ProCase-14-Protective-Ultrabook-Chromebook/dp/B017JHHO14/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 id="mxmaster">Logitech MX Master 2S wireless mouse</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2018/04/logitech-mx-master-2s-mouse.jpg?itok=Z7rTKuTH" title=""><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/1x1.png" width="400" height="400" alt="" data-src="/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2018/04/logitech-mx-master-2s-mouse.jpg?itok=Z7rTKuTH"></a></p>

<p>Trackpads are fine, but sometimes you need the accuracy and versatility of a mouse, especially if you're gaming or doing any video or photo editing — it's just more convenient.</p>

<p>The Logitech MX Master 2S mouse <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Cross-Computer-Control-Graphite/dp/B071YZJ1G1/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow">(starting around $90)</a> is just about as practical as it gets. It connects to your Dell XPS 15 via Bluetooth or receiver, and you can get about 70 days on a single battery.</p>

<p>The MX Master fits comfortably in your hand, and there are a bunch of customizable buttons in easy-to-reach spots. As well, the accompanying Logitech Flow software lets you control multiple devices with the one mouse, and you can even copy and paste content between them. This is the perfect mouse for seamless productivity.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Cross-Computer-Control-Graphite/dp/B071YZJ1G1/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 id="power-companion">Dell Power Companion</h2>

</div><p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2016/06/dell-power-companion-press.jpg?itok=Gj__iMvH" title="Dell Power Companion"><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/1x2.png" width="599" height="1214" alt="Dell Power Companion" data-src="/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2016/06/dell-power-companion-press.jpg?itok=Gj__iMvH"></a></p><div>

<p>We've all been there: you're out and about, and your laptop is nearly out of charge, with no charger or outlet in sight.</p>

<p>Dell's Power Companion <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293383-12578053%3Fsid%3DUUwpUdUnU40853%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.dell.com%252Fen-us%252Fshop%252Faccessories%252Fapd%252F469-5283&amp;token=HGTSQLhS" title="" rel="nofollow">(about $200)</a> is a laptop charger and external battery all in one. The XPS 15-compatible accessory includes a beefy 18,000mAh 6-cell battery pack for hours of additional runtime without having to tether yourself to a wall.</p>

<p>It also lets you charge two mobile devices via USB ports and charges itself via your Dell power adapter. The Dell Power Companion is rather compact at only 6 inches by 3 inches, and it's fairly light (around 14 ounces) for the sheer amount of battery shoved inside.</p>

<p>If you're constantly on the go and don't have time to sit and charge your XPS 15 (and hate crying in public), grab the Dell Power Companion and keep going.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293383-12578053%3Fsid%3DUUwpUdUnU40853%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.dell.com%252Fen-us%252Fshop%252Faccessories%252Fapd%252F469-5283&amp;token=HGTSQLhS" title="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">See at Dell</a></p>

<h2 id="cambond">Cambond 6.6-foot braided USB-C cable</h2>

</div><p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2016/06/cambond-braided-usbc-cable-press.jpg?itok=nBopJuNF" title="Cambond USB-C cable"><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/1x1.png" width="800" height="708" alt="Cambond USB-C cable" data-src="/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2016/06/cambond-braided-usbc-cable-press.jpg?itok=nBopJuNF"></a></p><div>

<p>Future-proof yourself and invest in a quality USB-C cable, since that's likely the way technology's headed. USB-C is versatile and fast, and you don't have to struggle to plug in cables right-side up ever again.</p>

<p>Cambond's braided cable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cambond-Charging-Galaxy-MacBook-Nintendo/dp/B01G2U0ICG/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow">(starting around $10)</a> is durable, flexible, and thanks to its nylon fiber jacket won't tangle up on itself. You can use the Cambond USB-C cable to connect to any device with a USB-C port. With a 4.5-star rating on Amazon with more than 370 reviews, you shouldn't be disappointed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cambond-Charging-Galaxy-MacBook-Nintendo/dp/B01G2U0ICG/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 id="seagate">Seagate Backup Plus Slim 2TB</h2>

</div><p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2016/06/seagate-backup-plus-slim-press.jpg?itok=U1v9OU9N" title="Seagate Backup Plus Slim"><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/1x2.png" width="712" height="1448" alt="Seagate Backup Plus Slim" data-src="/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2016/06/seagate-backup-plus-slim-press.jpg?itok=U1v9OU9N"></a></p><div>

<p>Sure, your Dell XPS 15 might have an enormous internal drive, but a portable external hard drive is always a great idea. You can carry around a plethora of music, movies, and more, without having to clutter up your laptop. Or you could use it as a backup drive, ensuring that should calamity befall your beloved laptop that your files will live on.</p>

<p>Seagate's 2TB Backup Plus Slim is one of the most popular external hard drives around (and <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-portable-hard-drive/">The Wirecutter's top choice</a> for an external drive) and for good reason. It's compact, supports USB 3.0, and is rather inexpensive, usually starting at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Backup-Portable-External-STDR2000100/dp/B00FRHTSK4?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow">about $70</a> for a whopping 2TB of storage.</p>

<p>It also comes in black, blue, red, silver, and gray, so you can choose one that matches your style. If you like OneDrive, then you're in for a treat, since the Backup Plus Slim comes with 200GB of cloud storage, free for two years!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Portable-External-Storage-STDR2000100/dp/B00FRHTSK4/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 id="bose">Bose SoundLink Revolve Bluetooth speaker</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2018/04/bose-soundlink-revolve-bluetooth-speaker.jpg?itok=BMr6yKcT" title=""><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/1x1.png" width="400" height="400" data-src="/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2018/04/bose-soundlink-revolve-bluetooth-speaker.jpg?itok=BMr6yKcT"></a></p>

<p>One of the best in the business, Bose's SoundLink Revolve is a marvel of Bluetooth speaker technology. Not only does its 360-degree design create room-filling sound, but this thing can very capably power an impromptu work/study break dance party. It gets <em>loud</em>, and even at high volumes, its audio is crisp, clear, and distortion-free. I've played with these speakers a few times and am always blown away at just how rich and warm the low end is without sacrificing and mids or highs whatsoever.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Revolve-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B06XCQKTKR/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow">$200 price tag</a> is also relatively easy to swallow, since it's fairly in line with other high-quality Bluetooth speakers. But here you're getting <em>Bose</em>. If you're looking for a portable music station instead of using headphones or the XPS 15's speakers, then this should be on your radar.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Revolve-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B06XCQKTKR/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 id="bangolufsen">B&amp;O Play H4 wireless headphones</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2018/04/bang-olufsen-play-h4-headphones.jpg?itok=bypI18Iu" title=""><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/all/themes/mbn2_twig/assets/images/3x4.png" width="400" height="496" alt="" data-src="/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2018/04/bang-olufsen-play-h4-headphones.jpg?itok=bypI18Iu"></a></p>

<p>The best headphones I've ever used in my life are made by Bang and Olufsen, and for Bluetooth sound quality, there are few that do it better than the B&amp;O Play H4. These headphones not only sound <em>fantastic</em>, but they look fabulous as well, with an almost steampunk vibe, thanks to cool color combinations, like charcoal gray and gold, and a rather muted tangerine with light gray combo (there's all black too).</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PLAY-Bang-Olufsen-Over-Ear-Headphones/dp/B06WLNQBQP/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40853" title="" rel="nofollow">roughly $300</a>, these are $50 cheaper than the Bose QC35 Series II headphones, and I honestly think they sound better (though the Play H4s do not have active noise cancellation). If noise cancellation is what you need, then these might not be for you, but their noise <em>isolation</em> is dynamite, and you can crank 'em up with little to no sound leakage.</p>

<p><strong>Updated April 2018:</strong> Updated pricing for each item, swapped out the older MX Master mouse for the newer MX Master 2S with Logitech Flow, swapped in the newer Dell U2717D monitor in place of the older model, and added the Bose SoundLink Revolve and B&amp;O Play H4 Bluetooth headphones.</p><p>
