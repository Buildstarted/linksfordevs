No. But we have come to believe that the best way forward is for alt .net to evolve. Communities thrive on unity, and in today&#x2019;s landscape I believe we will become a stronger community and do more to advance development practices in the .net community by coming together with other parts of the Melbourne .net community.</p><p id="a232" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz">What this looks like we&#x2019;re not sure yet&#x2026; and is something we&#x2019;ll work out together. If you&#x2019;ve enjoyed our community or would like to be a part of shaping what comes next, we&#x2019;d love to hear from you! We&#x2019;ll be getting a group of amazing people together &#x2014; along with members of VIC .net and other parts of the Melbourne community &#x2014; early next year to begin to shape the things to come. We would really love it for you to be a part of that. Please contact me clicking &#x201C;Send Jim Pelletier a message&#x201D; in this email, via meetup message or on twitter to find out more (@pjimmy my DMs are open).</p><p id="65c2" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz">Many thanks are due to everyone who has made this community an amazing one to be a part of for close to 15 years. There are far too many of you to single out, but we&#x2019;re so very thankful to every one of you who has made this such an amazing community&#x2026; you all know who you are :) And of course I have to give a big shout out to Andrew Bienert for getting us started all those years ago, and Page Up for being such an accomodating host in recent years.</p><p id="d89f" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz">Lookout for the announcement of a final <a href="http://alt.net/" class="at cg ga gb gc gd">alt.net</a> social gathering early in the new year and stay tuned to this meetup to see what exciting new thing rises from these ashes :)</p><figure class="gf gg gh gi gj gk cl cm paragraph-image"><img class="cp t u gn ak" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1302/0*iacEuSgBns1lpv_H.jpg" width="651"></figure></div></div></section></div>
