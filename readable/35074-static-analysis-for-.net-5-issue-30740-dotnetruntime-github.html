In typical LOB (line of business e.g. company internal software implementing business processes) applications, the standards for code quality are lower than in systems code (such as CoreFX and library code). I'm sure that the code I work on has this particular defect hundreds of times but I don't care in the slightest way about it. It does not affect productivity.</p><p>Another example is the category of performance rules. In LOB apps, 99% of code is cold. Performance does not matter to a large extent. This makes all performance-related rules noise.</p><p>In my experience, it is hard to find "linter" rules that help productivity in LOB apps. False positives are not just caused by inappropriate rule firing, they also are caused by correct rule firing in places that nobody cares about.</p><p>The difference between a good and a bad codebase is not the ruleset implemented by C# warnings, FxCop or proposed by this issue. If a codebase is bad, the issues usually are fundamental. Such issues cannot be expressed in terms of rules.</p><p>This is not to say that this effort is without value. Rather, I want to point out how varied the development scenarios are. This needs to be kept in mind when designing rule sets.</p><p>From personal experience, I know that developers get tired of warning systems very quickly if the warnings are not actionable.</p><p>If we want high actionability (and I think that is critical), this forces a tradeoff: Either the ruleset must be very small, or there must be a very good management system for unactionable warnings. I wonder how "industrial strength" analysis software does this (such as Coverity; Eric Lippert works there now).</p></div></div></div></div>
