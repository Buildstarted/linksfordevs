            For the second time in four days, Hong Kong was brought to a standstill by mass protests over a controversial extradition bill that threatens to chip away at the city‚Äôs diminishing semi-independence from China.

The demonstrations earned protesters a brief victory: the delay of a second reading of the bill. But tensions soon boiled over, when police fired rubber bullets and teargas to clear protesters from the streets, injuring dozens and further stoking outrage between the city‚Äôs pro-Beijing government and its residents.

Wednesday night‚Äôs events follow one of the biggest public protests in Hong Kong‚Äôs history, when more than one million people, about one-seventh of the population, swarmed the city‚Äôs streets on Sunday.

At the center of the public's fury is a proposed law that would allow China to extradite people from Hong Kong to the mainland. The bill has come to symbolize growing fear that the region, long-viewed as a separate entity from mainland China, is losing its autonomy under Beijing‚Äôs encroaching authoritarianism. They have reason to be concerned.

When the UK handed the island back to China in 1997, Hong Kong was promised freedoms of speech, press and assembly under its Basic Law ‚Äî which effectively serves as the islands constitution and differentiates it from the mainland. But in recent years, Beijing has begun to impose its will on Hong Kong, slowly eroding those freedoms in a bid to bring the region more firmly under its control.

‚ÄúI reminisce about the period of British rule. I was born and brought up in Hong Kong‚Äù Wong Fung Yiu, a 63 year old retiree at Sunday‚Äôs march told VICE News. ‚ÄúHuman rights were better back in that time, compared to what we have nowadays. I have no trust in Mainland China.‚Äù

Despite the delays, Carrie Lam, the island‚Äôs pro-Beijing Chief Executive, has vowed to push the bill through the government saying further delays would only cause more ‚Äúanxiety and divisiveness in society.
