                  <p><span>I can't speak for high performance/near or realtime system people but I would not trust a managed database service for those needs. My experience is that the managed offerings lag behind upstream versions substantially and usually are economical because they are multitenant. So you have a bit less predictability in io wait / cpu queue, lose host kernel level tunings (page sizes or hugepages, share memory allocation, etc), and - not naming names - some managed db services are so behind they lack critical query planner profiling features. That's not even going into application workload specific tuning for various nosql stores. This is a nice article but its audience is people that haven't scaled up a system but are trying to cope with success. It's not great generalized scaling advice.</span></p></div></td></tr>

When you have 10 users, your database concerns are more likely to be: Is my database up? Is my database secured? Do I have automated backups? Am I otherwise at risk of losing data? Is the database fast enough for now to not be a blocker to my business? All of which are concerns that tend to be well covered by managed database services.</span></p></div></td></tr>

What does he/she mean? What do we mean?<p>It could be 10 users that each views a few web pages once every month or it could be 10 heavy users for an internal system that uses the system most of the working day and creates thousands of calls per user to the system each day.</p><p>It is as a lot of people have mentioned also very different with information that can be easily cached and things like monetary transactions where you don't want to see old data in reads and therefore often can't cache or use read replica db.</p><p>For systems with heavy users I have seen the need to use a few servers even with just 1000 - 2000 users. For a web system the same can happen if you have 1000 users active on the site at the same time (within a minute or so).

We just added a aws managed load balancer into the setup and think it might be overkill.</p><p>For a client with NewsFeed needs, I used a dedicated server(64GB, 2TB space) to run nginx, app, cache, huge elasticsearch and postgres.

For instance, I run a shipping system that our entire operation depends on. I can't afford downtime either, as that would shutdown our entire shipping department. However, 1 server running on-prem, 1 remote in shared hosting and 2 failover servers on DigitalOcean costs ~$120/month.<p>What would a managed cloud like AWS or Azure provide besides higher expenses? Last I checked, AWS would be ~$550/month based on their calculator.</p><p>IT departments managed redundancy long before cloud was a thing, and it's certainly possible to achieve acceptable uptime without the managed services. I realize that I still rely on DO for their uptime, and I'm pricing renting rackspace for that reason. However, uptime is currently within acceptable levels (ie I haven't had to explain to the CEO why all his employees are standing around). We had tried 2 SaaS vendors before our current on-prem solution, and both had had downtime that cost us money. Both were hosted in AWS, so clearly that isn't the panacea for ultimate reliability. If our on-prem server goes down, I get a call. However, I got calls when our SaaS vendor went down as well; sitting on line with their tech support wasn't any great comfort.</p><p>The same graceful failover processes are accessible on machines you control, there's no reason that you have to run on one machine if you avoid the cloud. The biggest hurdle for me to implement this was database concurrency with multiple servers, but a cloud solution wouldn't have done anything to solve that problem.</p><p>[edit:] typos and miss-typed AWS pricing due to mobile keyboard.

                  <p><span>Hey, really specific question regarding your deployment. A teammate of mine reported difficulties with the .net SqlServer database driver establishing connection from a linux client (container instance based on the public .net core image) to a SqlServer instance (on windows) . Are you familiar with this problem?
I think moving our systems over to .NET Core on linux is the future, but this one experience has somewhat soured the idea for some decision makers and the team managing our db.</span></p></div></td></tr>

                  <p><span>I bumped into that at the office - connecting from a linux server to a microsoft sql server. We were able to connect after installing unixodbc and microsoft's odbc driver for sql server on linux. Note that a local mssql account is required, you can't connect with microsoft domain authentication from a linux box. We haven't finished testing and tweaking, but so far it looks like it's working.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Or do you mean an mssql user that the client with authenticate as?
