<p>However there would be a different issue in the scenario you described, MiniDumpWriteDump is not designed to take a dump of the same process it is executing within.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it makes sense to have WerFault.exe as special service or host, which can be used to collect process state and information about it. API must be usable from native C++ and from managed C# side, and must be well designed in both cases. (Simple to use, but having technical mechanism to perform all execution scenarios)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are trying to create dumps of exceptions that do not go unhandled then you probably want to call CreateProcess() to launch a helper process and get that helper process to call MinidumpWriteDump on its parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll try to return back to exception and their handling later on - I have some ideas about them.</p>
<p>But in here I would like to halt program and freeze it's execution at that very moment of time.<br>
All threads and their data must be stopped as well, and memory and execution state must be dumped.<br>
It should be possible to return back to that application state later on by loading dump file on developer's machine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could either use an interop layer (COM or reverse p/invoke) to call CLRMD using C++ code, or there is another API called ICorDebug which is written in C++. The APIs aren't identical, but you can accomplish similar things with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically I don't want to touch any API or design which is either native or managed code specific - we have application which consist code of both worlds, and I think both worlds need to walk hand by hand in design, API, easiness to use, cooperating with each other. I do understand that both worlds are quite far from each other, but one approach is to improve both world simultaneously, driving in best design and API practices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ICorDebug is unfortunately not as well documented</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is first indication of API, which will vanish next time you come to update it's functionality - I would say it's bit risky to use it.</p>
<p>We could make this also so that I will start to write code according to your instructions, using API's proposed by you - I'll try to simplify solution, API's, and make implementation native/managed code neutral - but newly written .dll's could be transferred under Microsoft responsibility.</p>
<p>Also if there will be heavier problems with design, implementation, or windows API itself, you could drive in necessary changes into windows as well.</p>
