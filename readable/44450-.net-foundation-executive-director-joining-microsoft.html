This is a dream come true and I look forward to continue helping the community build awesome things with .NET.</p><p>The transition is also bittersweet since joining Microsoft means that I&apos;ll no longer be a Regional Director or MVP. I have been tremendously honored to be a part of those communities and I&apos;ll cherish the friends made through those programs forever. The good news is that in my new role, I&apos;ll be highly engaged with the community and will remain in contact with everyone--and I&apos;ll still be at MVP summit!</p><p>Thank you all for your friendship and support over these years and I wish you all a happy and joyous holiday season.</p></div></div></div>
