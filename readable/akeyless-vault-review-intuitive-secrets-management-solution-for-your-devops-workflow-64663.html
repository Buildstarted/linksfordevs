These secrets, ranging from cryptographic keys to authentication secrets, are exposed to the public without any form of protection. They are supposed to be well-secured, but common DevOps oversights leave them vulnerable to leakage.</p><p id="9d46" data-selectable-paragraph="">This security concern can lead to serious consequences. It is an issue not exclusive to open source projects. Private source code repositories are similarly predisposed to unauthorize and secret access in the absence of sound security systems. As such, it makes sense to invest in a secure secrets management solution.</p><p id="2c45" data-selectable-paragraph="">Read along this Akeyless review to get acquainted with one of the best options to secure secrets in DevOps workflows: <a href="https://www.akeyless.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AKEYLESS VaultTM</a>.</p><p id="3db3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Designed to provide security across different cloud platforms, Akeyless Vault works with Ansible, Chef, CircleCI, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Terraform, and other platforms. It secures SSH keys, passwords, TLS/SSH certificates, API keys, AES encryption keys, SQL credentials, RSA signing keys, and various other secrets.</p><p id="2eb0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Akeyless Vault makes it easy to protect and manage various secrets and keys by providing a unified interface to handle all types of data that should be kept out of public access.</p><p id="562a" data-selectable-paragraph="">The system guarantees zero-trust encryption with NIST FIPS 140–2 certification, rigorous third-party testing that ensures the highest standards of cryptography validation. Distributed Fragments Cryptography (DFC™) ensures that encryption key fragments are never combined, thus providing zero-visibility of secrets and keys.</p><p id="aada" data-selectable-paragraph="">The solution also comes with automation tools and is built with scalability in mind to suit organizations of all sizes.</p><p id="f272" data-selectable-paragraph="">Akeyless Vault has all of the secret storage and management features offered by other similar solutions. It provides an encrypted unified secrets store, multiplatform connectivity, and support for a wide range of plugins. It can fetch secrets from various platforms users may want to add. Also, Akeyless touts the broadest possible platform coverage with its API compatibility with Hashicorp Vault OSS plugins.</p><p id="5175" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Akeyless Vault enterprise solution is available in two variants: (1) on-premises software appliance designed to allow scalability with minimum configurations, and (2) software-as-a-service (SaaS).</p><p id="2f61" data-selectable-paragraph="">Akeyless employs a just-in-time-access approach, which automates the issuance and revocation of certificates to enable dynamic one-time access to various resources. With this method, quick access to on-demand temporary secrets is only allowed when needed for specific tasks. A limited access period is granted, under the correct authorization, which should be just enough to complete a specific task. The secrets provided are ephemeral, with short time-to-live, and which afterward expire once the required access is granted.</p><p id="d7ce" data-selectable-paragraph="">In addition, to make the onboarding experience superfast, Akeyless Vault provides the ability to migrate from existing Vault. Akeyless developed an automatic secrets migration tool that can scan and retrieve information from various secret repositories such as Kubernetes Secrets, Ansible Vault, Jenkins Secrets, and many others.</p><p id="6d56" data-selectable-paragraph="">Moreover, Akeyless Vault seamlessly supports out-of-the-box privileged access management capabilities (e.g. Kubernetes control, SSH, SQL, RDP) by implementing a just-in-time-access approach combined with the ability to authenticate using third-party IDPs. This is similar to the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/bless" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bless OSS project by Netflix</a> but much more comprehensive. Other similar systems typically necessitate heavy configuration or developer involvement to support these use cases.</p><p id="3ce6" data-selectable-paragraph="">Insights and Analytics module provide rich analytics functionality, allowing the user to analyze the status of his secrets posture in various environments from a bird’s eye view, based on the geolocation of the IP addresses that consume secrets, division of the requests by the actions type, request volume, etc.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*TVKMQ3tAmLFvgZ0S?q=20" width="1171" height="659"></p><p><img alt="Image for post" width="1171" height="659"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="8741" data-selectable-paragraph="">To support complex enterprise environments such as hybrid and multi-region, Akeyless has designed a scalable, high available, and multi-tenant solution without the need for heavy-lifting configuration on their on-prem and surely in the cloud. With this scalability comes performance optimization especially in terms of bandwidth, encryption, and elastic processing. The system conducts local client-side encryption and ensures consistent hardware-agnostic performance.</p><p id="cd62" data-selectable-paragraph="">Also worth noting is Akeyless Vault’s secret-zero problem solution. It provides a system that does not require users to supply a secret to gain access to other secrets. Akeyless Universal Identity provides a machine identity where CSP IAM is not available (private cloud/legacy). Using short-lived, constantly rotated identity-tokens, an identity can be preserved and secured. Akeyless unique solution allows a fully automated identity creation process using derived identity from the “mother” server.</p><p id="0976" data-selectable-paragraph="">Akeyless Vault employs a patent-pending security technology dubbed as Distributed Fragments Cryptography (DFC), which undertakes encrypting/decrypting operations without the need to fuse encryption key fragments. Essentially, what it does is to prevent instances of intentionally disjoined encryption keys from existing in their whole form to make it virtually impossible for hackers to obtain the complete keys.</p><p id="3dce" data-selectable-paragraph="">Akeyless builds on a zero-trust encryption system, which ensures the protection of all keys in any multi-cloud or hybrid environment. Even Akeyless itself does not have any knowledge of user keys due to the customer fragment owned by the customer on-prem. The key fragments undergo constant independent mathematical refresh to ascertain that nobody manages to put the fragmented keys together, not even the cryptographers at Akeyless.</p><p id="abd2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Moreover, Akeyless Vault offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which is generally far more cost-efficient compared to per-cluster pricing or flat rates, especially considering the total cost of ownership. With the price you pay for the Akeyless solution, you get complete compute resources, human knowledge, and enterprise-grade production.</p><p id="f726" data-selectable-paragraph="">This also provides an opportunity for quicker onboarding. Competitors typically provide more complex deployment at higher customer costs.</p><p id="415c" data-selectable-paragraph="">In all secrets management solutions available today, users have to go through the tedious process of installing and configuring the system before it becomes operational. Akeyless SaaS offers a faster and more convenient self-deploying solution.</p><p id="e93e" data-selectable-paragraph="">With this technology, Akeyless allows time-to-market that is significantly faster than the two-year deployment process of Hashicorp Vault <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/how-cisco-operationalizes-vault-multi-platform-enterprise-offering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">(according to a Cisco case study)</a>.</p><p id="35d0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once signed-up to Akeyless you will immediately enjoy a global, scalable secret management solution for your needs that is also secured by the DFC technology. See below.</p><p id="77f3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Akeyless uses a multi-region SaaS architecture that addresses geographic issues — latency in particular. This ensures an anywhere-accessible secrets vault that is free from web connection performance and consistency problems.</p><p id="c067" data-selectable-paragraph="">Additionally, Akeyless is compatible with multi-cloud environments, which makes secrets management easier and scalable. It accelerates deployment and makes maintenance more efficient.</p><p id="0ca3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Akeyless’ SaaS system provides the reassurance that you can manage keys and secrets in a cloud environment without the need to trust the service provider. This is possible because of its unique DFC technology, which enables zero customer secret visibility by not only encrypting keys, codes, and secrets but also splitting or fragmenting the keys, providing the customer with a unique customer fragment of the keys, not controlled by Akeyless.</p><p id="b0e2" data-selectable-paragraph="">With this system, you are assured that cloud service providers will not be compelled to submit any of your secrets since the data does not reside on their infrastructure in the first place. This ensures both compliance with existing regulations (such as CLOUD Act) on the lawful use of cloud services without exposing your data to being obtained through such regulatory frameworks.</p><p id="8dff" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you choose to deploy Akeyless Vault as a SaaS system, there is nothing to download and install. To start, you just have to sign up for an account, which takes a minute or so to complete.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*c-u9BIr2hz-rwr_3?q=20" width="737" height="448"></p><p><img alt="Image for post" width="737" height="448"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="e0f0" data-selectable-paragraph="">After getting an account, you can proceed to log in through the conventional method (clicking on the Login button on the uppermost right corner) or through Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), which requires you to enter an Access ID.</p><p id="f9db" data-selectable-paragraph="">You will be greeted by a simple and intuitive interface once you are signed in. The links to the most important functions including the Secrets and Keys, Access Roles, Authorization Methods, Audit Logs, and Analytics are presented on the left sidebar.</p><p id="bd30" data-selectable-paragraph="">Shown at the center is the collection of secrets stored in Akeyless Vault. You can view these in folder or list view. If you have too many of them, you can use the search feature, which conveniently filters the folders or list items shown according to the keyword you enter.</p><p id="33a8" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you need help in using Akeyless Vault’s features, a convenient “How To” resource is provided on the sidebar. It presents quick guides on creating secrets, configuring keyless SSH, provisioning secrets to K8s, and other actions.</p><p id="b1c3" data-selectable-paragraph="">For integrations, a host of guides are provided in the Integration Center bar at the bottom part of the software’s home page.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*2XlEpSOeupXhJy6V?q=20" width="1311" height="682"></p><p><img alt="Image for post" width="1311" height="682"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="8fb5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Akeyless Vault allows the creation of static and dynamic secrets.</p><p id="4a04" data-selectable-paragraph="">Static secrets are key/value-variable encrypted using DFC technology. They are designed for passwords, API tokens, credit card numbers, and other information that should not be revealed to anyone other than the owner.</p><p id="ad30" data-selectable-paragraph="">To create static secrets, you need to click on the New button in the middle of the Vault interface. Click on the Static Secret option and enter the appropriate details into the fields provided in the modal window.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*pXLNus_yy1RXHbb9?q=20" width="1025" height="639"></p><p><img alt="Image for post" width="1025" height="639"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="3c11" data-selectable-paragraph="">Dynamic secrets, on the other hand, are designed to reduce operational burden without sacrificing security. Through a just-in-time approach, it limits access privileges on a per-need basis without requiring the manual issuance and updating of secrets and expiration policies. Akeyless generates temporary credentials within the database or resources a machine or system needs to access. These temporary credentials are then automatically deleted after use.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*j7Srzg2PiYgabs9o?q=20" width="1431" height="464"></p><p><img alt="Image for post" width="1431" height="464"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="bcce" data-selectable-paragraph="">Using Akeyless Vault is a straightforward process. It is easy to figure out which buttons to click and what information to enter to add, use, or delete secrets. If there is anything confusing, there are how-to guides readily available within the system. For more complex issues, Akeyless provides online support via Slack or email. The Online Support button is located near the bottom part of the left sidebar.</p><p id="a158" data-selectable-paragraph="">Akeyless Vault features six authentication methods, namely API key, Open ID, SAML, LDAP, Azure Active Directory, and AWS IAM. Having these options is advantageous for organizations with different use cases and members in different locations. Large companies can take advantage of LDAP, for example, to support enterprise-level single sign-on authentication.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*22WQk1qq8he1lhe-?q=20" width="719" height="436"></p><p><img alt="Image for post" width="719" height="436"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="17e2" data-selectable-paragraph="">To prevent unwanted access to the Akeyless SaaS platform, a timeout system is implemented. It automatically logs out signed in accounts after a brief period of inactivity or idleness. Also, accounts are immediately logged out once the web browser used to access Akeyless Vault is closed. Somebody using the computer/browser used to log in to Akeyless cannot access the account by reopening the browser even if the account was not manually logged out.</p><p id="34bb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Akeyless Vault simplifies the process of keeping secrets through a vaulting solution that does not require installation and other tedious processes. It offers features that one-ups competing for solutions. It enables immediate onboarding, seamless connectivity, and a zero-trust encryption system that ensures zero-visibility of the stored secrets and keys.</p><p id="836d" data-selectable-paragraph="">The system is multi-platform compatible and cloud-agnostic. It also touts a secret-zero problem solution. With all of these considered, this Akeyless review confidently awards the solution a “Recommended” mark. Akeyless offers a unified and highly secure approach that simplifies the complex and saves time and effort for everyone in DevOps teams.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*Piks8Tu6xUYpF4DU?q=20" width="727" height="18"></p><p><img alt="Image for post" width="727" height="18"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="e5d4" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Subscribe to </strong><a href="https://www.faun.dev/join?utm_source=medium.com/faun&amp;utm_medium=medium&amp;utm_campaign=faunmediumprebanner" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>FAUN topics</strong></a><strong> and get your weekly curated email of the must-read tech stories, news, and tutorials </strong>🗞️</p><p id="9b5e" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/joinfaun" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> </strong>🐦<strong> and </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/faun.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> </strong>👥<strong> and </strong><a href="https://instagram.com/fauncommunity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> </strong>📷 <strong>and join our </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/364904580892967/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/faundev" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Linkedin</strong></a><strong> Groups </strong>💬</p></div></div><div><p><h2 id="3062" data-selectable-paragraph="">If this post was helpful, please click the clap 👏 button below a few times to show your support for the author! ⬇</h2></p></div></div></div>
