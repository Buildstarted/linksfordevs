          <p>The use of Span has raised some interesting questions.</p>
<p>In the SQLite API, when a parameter is a string, it is usually just a pointer, with the (documented) expectation that the string ends with a zero terminator byte.</p>
<p>So, at a higher layer, if we use a <code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;byte&gt;</code> for that string, the Length or the span is ignored.  By the time it gets to SQLite, it's just a pointer.  Is that a signal that we shouldn't be using span?</p>
<p>Suppose the string is "hello".  That's 5 bytes of actual string plus one byte for the zero terminator.  We could pass a span of length 5 or a span of length 6.  It doesn't matter to SQLite, because it's just going to look for that zero byte anyway.</p>
<p>Heck, we could pass a span of length 1, and it still wouldn't matter.  But I mention that just to illustrate the problem.  Clearly, if we're going to use a span, we should have the length be correct.</p>
<p>But which is more correct?  Should the Length include the zero terminator or not?</p>
<p>Including the zero byte in the length seems wrong because the zero is not part of the string data.  If we called strlen() on the pointer, it would return a length which did not include the zero.  If we passed this pointer to System.Text methods to convert it from UTF-8 to System.String, the length we provide should not include the zero byte.  The length of the string "hello" is 5.</p>
<p>However, it also seems wrong to not include the zero byte in the length.  The zero byte may not be part of the string, but it is a documented and required part of the block of bytes the function expects.  And if we don't include the zero byte, then we are passing a span to a function which is going to walk beyond the end of that span's length, which seems wrong.  The length of the zero-terminated block of memory that represents "hello" is 6.</p>
<p>At the moment, the solution I have chosen is to include the zero byte in the span length.  And the provider code checks to make sure the last byte of the span is a zero.</p>
<p>But this is only half the story.  We have a similar but slightly different set of problems for cases where SQLite is returning a string or passing one in a callback.</p>
<p>In this case, SQLite itself is responsible for putting that zero byte in place, and it does.  But when we construct a <code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;byte&gt;</code> for that piece of memory, again, do we include the zero byte in the length or not?</p>
<p>In this case, a big difference is that the code that receives that span is likely to use the Length and ignore the presence of any zero terminator  For example, using System.Text functions to convert from UTF-8 to a string, the span Length must be correct and must not include the zero terminator.</p>
<p>If we did include the zero terminator in this upward-moving set of strings, then most cases that use the spans would need to subtract one from the Length before using it.  And should it check to make sure the last byte actually is a zero before doing so?</p>
<p>So for the moment, the solution I have chosen is to NOT include the zero terminator when constructing a span for a string that is coming from SQLite.</p>
<p>Neither of these decisions seems correct.  Each one merely seems to be the least incorrect option.</p>
<p>And then there is the inconsistency.  I have two very similar questions, but I came up with two different answers.  That too seems wrong.  For example, as things stand right now, if you receive a string from SQLite as a span and then pass that span directly back to another SQLite function, it won't work.</p>
