They want their players to love the game while they are playing, think about it when they are not playing, share their enthusiasm with their friends, and return to play again and again. They’ve used Unity since they began creating games in 2011.</p><p>As with any game company, Tic Toc is always looking for ways to get better performance out of its code and, at the same time, iterate faster on design. Garth Smith, Tic Toc’s lead programmer, put it more elegantly: “We need to make better games, faster.” He’s a long-time Unity user, and finds some of the major new features in Unity 2018.x remarkably powerful.</p><p>With several high-profile puzzle releases due in 2019, including a Match 3 and a Collapse game, Smith committed his team to leveraging ECS in particular. “Working with ECS, it’s definitely a different way of coding than what people are used to,” Smith noted, “Data-oriented programming is not taught in school much, so it’s a major paradigm shift. Even for us, there was a little bit of fear about starting something new.” However, what they accomplished with ECS made them believers.</p><p>The results:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">
	60 fps on mobile devices without CPUs overheating
	</li><li dir="ltr">
	More efficient testing workflow
	</li><li dir="ltr">
	Fewer iterations and less troubleshooting/bug-fixing
	</li><li dir="ltr">
	Longer device battery life
