                    <blockquote>Are you tired of babysitting your DL models? If so, you're in the right place. In this post, we discuss motivations and strategies behind effectively searching for the best set of hyperparameters for any deep learning model. We'll demonstrate how this can be done on FloydHub, as well as which direction the research is moving. When you're done reading this post, you'll have added some powerful new tools to your data science tool-belt – making the process of finding the best configuration for your deep learning task as automatic as possible. </blockquote><p>Unlike machine learning models, deep learning models are literally full of hyperparameters. Would you like some some evidence? Just take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/master/tensor2tensor/models/transformer.py#L1467-L1525">Transformer base v1 hyperparameters definition</a>.</p><p>I rest my case. </p><p>Of course, not all of these variables contribute in the same way to the model's learning process, but, given this additional complexity, <strong>it's clear that finding the best configuration for these variables in such a high dimensional space is not a trivial challenge</strong>. </p><p>Luckily, we have different strategies and tools for tackling the searching problem. Let's dive in!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>How? </strong></p><p>We want to find the <em>best configuration</em> of hyperparameters which will give us the <em>best score</em> on the metric we care about on the validation / test set. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why? </strong></p><p>Every scientist and researcher wants the best model for the task given the available resources: 💻, 💰 and ⏳ (aka <em>compute</em>,<em> money</em>, and <em>time</em>). Effective hyperparameter search is the missing piece of the puzzle that will help us move towards this goal. </p><p><strong>When? </strong></p><ul><li>It's quite common among researchers and hobbyists to try one of these searching strategies during the <em>last steps of development</em>. This helps provide possible improvements from the best model obtained already after several hours of work.</li><li>Hyperparameter search is also common as a stage or component in a <em>semi/fully automatic deep learning pipeline</em>. This is, obviously, more common among data science teams at companies. </li></ul><p>Let's start with the simplest possible definition,</p><blockquote><em><strong>Hyperparameters</strong> are the knobs that you can turn when building your machine / deep learning model. </em></blockquote><figure><img src="https://blog.floydhub.com/content/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-22-at-17.59.25.png"><figcaption>Hyperparameters - the "knobs" or "dials" metaphor</figcaption></figure><p>Or, alternatively:</p><blockquote><strong>Hyperparameters</strong> are<em> </em>all the training variables set manually with a pre-determined value before starting the training.</blockquote><p>We can likely agree that the Learning Rate and the Dropout Rate are considered hyperparameters, but what about the model design variables? These include embeddings, number of layers, activation function, and so on. Should we consider these variables as hyperparameters?</p><figure><img src="https://blog.floydhub.com/content/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-22-at-18.32.53.png"><figcaption>Model Design Variables + Hyperparameters → Model Parameters</figcaption></figure><p>For simplicity's sake, yes – we can also consider the <strong>model design components</strong> as part of the hyperparameters set.</p><p>Finally, how about the parameters obtained from the training process – the variables learned from the data? These weights are known as <strong>model parameters</strong>. We'll exclude them from our hyperparameter set.</p><p>Okay, let's try a real-world example. Take a look at the picture below for an example illustrating the different classifications of variables in a deep learning model.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.floydhub.com/content/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-22-at-18.42.51.png"><figcaption>Variables classification example</figcaption></figure><p>Now that we know we want to search for the best configuration of hyperparameters, we're faced with the challenge that <em>searching for hyperparameters is an</em> <em>iterative process </em>constrained by <strong>💻</strong>,<strong> 💰 </strong>and<strong> ⏳</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.floydhub.com/content/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-22-at-19.06.53.png"><figcaption>The hyperparameters search cycle</figcaption></figure><p>Everything starts with a guess (<em>step 1</em>) of a promising configuration, then we will need to wait until a full training (<em>step 2</em>) to get the actual evaluation on the metric of interest (<em>step 3</em>). We'll track the progress of the searching process (<em>step 4</em>), and then according to our searching strategy, we'll select a new guess (<em>step 1</em>). </p><p>We'll keep going like this until we reach a terminating condition (such as running out of <strong>⏳</strong> or <strong>💰</strong>). &nbsp;</p><p>We have four main strategies available for searching for the best configuration.</p><ul><li><strong>Babysitting (aka Trial &amp; Error) </strong></li><li><strong>Grid Search</strong></li><li><strong>Random Search</strong></li><li><strong>Bayesian Optimization</strong></li></ul><p>Babysitting is also known as <em>Trial &amp; Error</em> or <em>Grad Student Descent</em> in the academic field. This approach is <strong>100% manual</strong> and the most widely adopted by researchers, students, and hobbyists. </p><p>The end-to-end workflow is really quite simple: a student devises a new experiment that she follows through all the steps of the learning process (from data collection to feature map visualization), then will she iterates sequentially on the hyperparameters until she runs out time (usually due to a deadline) or motivation. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.floydhub.com/content/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-23-at-14.59.35.png"><figcaption>Babysitting</figcaption></figure><p>If you've enrolled in the deeplearning.ai course, then you're familiar with this approach - it is <a href="https://www.coursera.org/lecture/deep-neural-network/hyperparameters-tuning-in-practice-pandas-vs-caviar-DHNcc">the Panda workflow described by Professor Andrew Ng</a>.</p><p>This approach is very educational, but it doesn't scale inside a team or a company where the time of the data scientist is really valuable. &nbsp;</p><p>Thus, we arrive at the question:</p><blockquote><strong><em>“Is there a better way to invest my </em>time?<em>”</em></strong></blockquote><p>Surely, yes! We can optimize your time by defining an automatic strategy for hyperparameter searching!</p><p>Taken from the imperative command "Just try everything!" comes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization#Grid_search">Grid Search</a> – a naive approach of simply trying every possible configuration.</p><p>Here's the workflow:</p><ul><li>Define a grid on <em>n</em> dimensions, where each of these maps for an hyperparameter. e.g. <em>n</em> = (learning_rate, dropout_rate, batch_size)</li><li>For each dimension, define the range of possible values: e.g. batch_size = [4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]</li><li>Search for all the possible configurations and wait for the results to establish the best one: e.g. <em>C1</em> = (0.1, 0.3, 4) -&gt; acc = 92%, <em>C2</em> = (0.1, 0.35, 4) -&gt; acc = 92.3%, etc...</li></ul><p>The image below illustrates a simple grid search on two dimensions for the Dropout and Learning rate. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.floydhub.com/content/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-23-at-15.33.56.png"><figcaption>Grid Search on two variables in a parallel concurrent execution</figcaption></figure><p>This strategy is embarrassingly parallel because it doesn't take into account the computation history (we will expand this soon). But what it does mean is that the more computational resources <strong>💻</strong> you have available, then the more guesses you can try at the same time!</p><p>The real pain point of this approach is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of dimensionality</a>. This means that more dimensions we add, the more the search will explode in time complexity (usually by an exponential factor), ultimately making this strategy unfeasible!</p><p>It's common to use this approach when the dimensions are less than or equal to 4. But, in practice, even if it guarantees to find the best configuration <em>at the end, it's still not preferable.</em> Instead, it's better to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_search">Random Search</a> — which we'll discuss next<em>.</em></p><h3 id="try-grid-search-now-">Try grid search now!</h3><p>Click this button to open a <a href="https://blog.floydhub.com/workspaces/" rel="nofollow">Workspace</a> on <a href="https://www.floydhub.com/?utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_source=hyperparameters_search_examples&amp;utm_campaign=sept_2018" rel="nofollow">FloydHub</a>.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>A few years ago, Bergstra and Bengio published <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf">an amazing paper</a> where they demonstrated the inefficiency of Grid Search.</p><p>The only real difference between Grid Search and Random Search is on the <em>step 1</em> of the strategy cycle – Random Search picks the point randomly from the configuration space. </p><p>Let's use the image below (provided in the paper) to show the claims reported by the researchers.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.floydhub.com/content/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-24-at-17.09.14.png"><figcaption>Grid Search vs Random Search</figcaption></figure><p>The image compare the two approaches by searching the best configuration on two hyperparameters space. It also assumes that one parameter is more important that the other one. This is a safe assumption because Deep Learning models, as mentioned at the beginning, are really full of hyperparameters, and usually the researcher / scientist / student knows which ones affect the training most significantly.</p><p>In the Grid Layout, it's easy to notice that, even if we have trained 9 models, we have used only 3 values per variable! Whereas, with the Random Layout, it's extremely unlikely that we will select the same variables more than once. It ends up that, with the second approach, we will have trained 9 model using 9 different values for each variables. </p><p>As you can tell from the space exploration at the top of each layout in the image, we have explored the hyperparameters space more widely with Random Search (especially for the more important variables). This will help us to find the best configuration in fewer iterations.</p><p>In summary: Don't use Grid Search if your searching space contains more than 3 to 4 dimensions. Instead, use Random Search, which provides a really good baseline for each searching task.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.floydhub.com/content/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-24-at-18.13.43.png"><figcaption>Pros and cons of Grid Search and Random Search</figcaption></figure><h3 id="try-random-search-now-">Try Random Search now!</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a target="_blank" href="https://floydhub.com/run?template=https://github.com/floydhub/hyperparameters-search-examples">

Since we're looking for the lowest possible value, we can think of it as the loss function. </p><p>The black dots represent the model trained so far. The red line is the ground truth, or, in other words, the function that we are trying to learn. The black line represents the mean of the actual hypothesis we have for the ground truth function and the grey area shows the related uncertainty, or variance, in the space. </p><p>As we can notice, the uncertainty diminishes around the dots because we are quite confident about the results we can get around these points (since we've already trained the model here). The uncertainty, then, increases in the areas where we have less information.</p><p>Now that we've defined the starting point, we're ready to choose the next promising variables on which train a model. For doing this, we need to define an <em>acquisition function</em> which will tell us where to sample the next configuration. </p><p>In this example, we are using the <em>Expected Improvement</em>: a function that is aiming to find the lowest possible value if we will use the proposed configuration from the uncertainty area.

But, just like every tool, they come with their downsides:</p><ul><li>By definition, the process is sequential</li><li>It can only handle numeric parameters</li><li>It doesn't provide any mechanism to stop the training if it's performing poorly</li></ul><p>Please note that we've really just scratched the surface about this fascinating topic, and if you're interested in a more detailed reading and how to extend SMBO, then take a look at <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hutter/papers/10-TR-SMAC.pdf">this paper</a>.</p><h3 id="try-bayesian-optimization-now-">Try Bayesian Optimization now!</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a target="_blank" href="https://floydhub.com/run?template=https://github.com/floydhub/hyperparameters-search-examples">

This policy acts as a funnel for the experiments and optimizes for the resources inside the team. In this way, we will be able to allocate more resources only to the most promising experiments. </p><p>The <code>floyd-cli</code> (the software used by our users to communicate with FloydHub and that we've <a href="https://github.com/floydhub/floyd-cli">open-sourced on Github</a>) provides a flag with this purpose: our power users are using it massively to regulate their experiments.</p><p>These criteria can be applied manually when babysitting the learning process, or you can do even better by integrated these rules in your experiment through the hooks/callbacks provided in the most common frameworks:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras">Keras</a> provides a great <a href="https://keras.io/callbacks/#earlystopping">EarlyStopping</a> function and even better a suite of super useful <a href="https://keras.io/callbacks/">callbacks</a>. Since Keras has been recently integrated inside TensorFlow, you will be able to use the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/Callback">callbacks inside your TensorFlow</a> code.</li><li><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> provides the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/train#Training_Hooks">Training Hooks</a>, these are probably not intuitive as Keras callbacks (or the tf.keras API), but they provides you more control over the state of the execution. TensorFlow 2.0 (currently in beta) introduces a new API for managing hyperparameters optimization, you can find more info in the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/r2/hyperparameter_tuning_with_hparams">official TensorFlow docs</a>.</li><li>There is even more in the TensorFlow/Keras realm!

If so, you can direct your complaints to me and I'll be happy to update the content!)</p><h3 id="this-is-not-the-end-">This is not the end. </h3><p>There is a subfield of machine learning called “AutoML” (Automatic Machine Learning) which aims to automate methods for model selection, features extraction and / or hyperparameters optimization. </p><p>This tool is the answer to the last question (I promise!):</p><blockquote><strong><em> “Can we <strong>learn</strong> the whole process?”</em></strong></blockquote><p>You can think of AutoML as Machine Learning task which is solving another Machine Learning task, similar to what we've done with the Baeysian Optimiziation. Essentially, this is Meta-Machine Learning.</p><p>You have most likely heard of <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/03/using-evolutionary-automl-to-discover.html">Google's AutoML</a> which is their re-branding for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_architecture_search">Neural Architecture Search</a>. Remember, all the way at the beginning of the article, we decided to merge the <em>model design component</em> into the hyperparameters variables? Well, Neural Architecture Search is the subfield of AutoML which aims to find the best models for a given task. A full discussion on this topic would require a series of articles. Luckily, Dr. Rachel Thomas at fast.ai did an amazing job that <a href="http://www.fast.ai/2018/07/12/auto-ml-1/">we are happy to link!</a></p><p>I would like to share with you another interesting <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/population-based-training-neural-networks/">research effort from DeepMind</a> where they used a variant of Evolution Strategy algorithm to perform hyperparameters search called Population Based Training (PTB is also at the foundation of another <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/capture-the-flag/">amazing research from DeepMind</a> which wasn't quite covered from the press but that I strongly encourage you to check out on your own). Quoting DeepMind:</p><blockquote>PBT - like random search - starts by training many neural networks in parallel with random hyperparameters. But instead of the networks training independently, it uses information from the rest of the population to refine the hyperparameters and direct computational resources to models which show promise. This takes its inspiration from genetic algorithms where each member of the population, known as a worker, can exploit information from the remainder of the population. For example, a worker might copy the model parameters from a better performing worker. It can also explore new hyperparameters by changing the current values randomly.</blockquote><p>Of course, there are probably tons of other super interesting researches in this area. I've just shared with you the ones who gained some recent prominence in the news. </p><p>One of the biggest features of FloydHub is the ability to compare different model you're training when using a different set of hyperparameters. </p><p>The picture below shows a list of jobs in a FloydHub project. You can see that this user is using the job's <code>message</code> field (e.g. <code>floyd run --message "SGD, lr=1e-3, l1_drop=0.3" ...</code> &nbsp;) to highlight the hyperparameters used on each of these jobs.</p><p>Additionally, you can also see the <a href="https://blog.floydhub.com/metrics-on-floydhub/">training metrics</a> for each job. These offer a quick glance to help you understand which of these jobs performed best, as well as the type of machine used and the total training time.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.floydhub.com/content/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-24-at-19.10.18.png"><figcaption>Project Page</figcaption></figure><p>The FloydHub dashboard gives you an easy way to compare all the training you've done in your hyperparameter optimization – and it updates in real-time.</p><p>Our advice is to create a different FloydHub project for each of the tasks/problems you have to solve.
