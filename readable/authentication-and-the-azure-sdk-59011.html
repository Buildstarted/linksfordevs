						<p>How do your apps identify themselves to the cloud resources you are using?</p>

<p>This is one of the most important considerations when building a cloud-native app. Ideally, your app should run in all phases of development (dev, test, and prod, for example). When you write a service, you should be able to take the same code and run it in your development environment, on a compute service in your own data center, or in any of the Azure clouds without code changes. How do you do this?</p>

<p>The answer is to use the <tt></tt>DefaultAzureCredential from the Azure Identity library. This is a type that is available in <a href="https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/dotnet/Azure.Identity/1.1.1/api/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer">.NET</a>, <a href="https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/java/azure-identity/1.1.0-beta.1/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer">Java</a>, <a href="https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-identity/1.0.2/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a>, and <a href="https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-identity/1.3.0/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer">Python</a> across all of our latest client libraries (App Config, Event Hubs, Key Vault, and Storage) and will be built into future client libraries as well. It helps you avoid credential leakage, and is the easiest way to handle identity, authentication, and authorization in your applications.</p>

<p>The basics are very simple. To create a client, use the <tt>DefaultAzureCredential</tt> as the credential type. For example, to create a Key Vault Secret client (in each language):</p>

<pre><code>
<span>var</span> client <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SecretClient</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Uri</span><span>(</span>keyVaultUrl<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>DefaultAzureCredential</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><pre><code>
SecretClient client <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SecretClientBuilder</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>vaultUrl</span><span>(</span>keyVaultUrl<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>credentials</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>buildClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><pre><code>
<span>const</span> client <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SecretClient</span><span>(</span>keyVaultUrl<span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>DefaultAzureCredential</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><pre><code>
client <span>=</span> SecretClient<span>(</span>keyVaultUrl<span>,</span> DefaultAzureCredential<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre>

<p>The <tt>DefaultAzureCredential</tt> attempts to figure out what environment you are running in, and uses the most appropriate credential for the purpose. Internally, it is a credential chain, attempting multiple credential types in order. Once a working credential has been found, it is used.</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables">Environment variables</h2>
<p>The first choice is the environment. If you have the following environment variables set, they will be used along with Azure Active Directory to authenticate the connection.</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>AZURE_CLIENT_ID</tt></li>
<li><tt>AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET</tt></li>
<li><tt>AZURE_TENANT_ID</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to explicitly define what user is used for authentication when communicating with an Azure resource, set these environment variables. These environment variables define the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noopener noreferrer">service principal</a> that will be used for authentication and authorization. You can configure a service principal for your application using the Azure CLI as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --name http://my-application --skip-assignment
{
    "appId": "generated app id",
    "displayName": "my-application",
    "name": "http://my-application",
    "password": "random password",
    "tenant": "tenant id"
}</code></pre>

<p>Place the <tt>appId</tt>, <tt>password</tt>, and <tt>tenant into the appropriate environment variables. For example:</tt></p>

<pre><code># PowerShell
$ $env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID="generated app id"
$ $env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="random password"
$ $env:AZURE_TENANT_ID="tenant id"

# Bash
$ export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="generated app id"
$ export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="random password"
$ export AZURE_TENANT_ID="tenant id"</code></pre>

<p>You will also need to give the service principal permissions to access the resource. Use the following command for the Key Vault example above:</p>

<pre><code>$ az keyvault set-policy --name my-key-vault --spn $AZURE_CLIENT_ID --secret-permissions get list</code></pre>

<p>Now that your environment is set up, the <tt>client</tt> in your application will be able to communicate with the Key Vault.</p>
<h2 id="managed-identities">Managed Identities</h2>
<p>The environment is a great option when you have all the information necessary to authenticate as a service principal. However, it does establish a management burden. You have to maintain the service credentials, and rotate client secrets on a regular basis. When running your service in the confines of a cloud compute instance (such as a virtual machine, container, App Service, Functions, or Service Bus), you can use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noopener noreferrer">managed identities</a>. When you establish a system-assigned identity for the service, a service principal is created for you that is associated with the service. You can also establish a user-assigned identity (which is a service principal that you associate with the service). Your application can get authenticated easily by reaching out to an endpoint on the compute resource. the <tt>DefaultAzureCredential</tt> manages this communication for you.</p>
<p>For instance, let's say you are running your application in Azure App Service. To create a suitable managed identity with permissions to access your Key Vault:</p>

<pre><code>$ az webapp identity assign -g MyResourceGroup -n MyWebApp</code></pre>

<p>Make a note of the Object ID for the created service principal. If you need to display the Object ID, you can do so with this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ az webapp identity show -g MyResourceGroup -n MyWebApp</code></pre>

<p>Set the Key Vault policy using the <tt>az keyvault set-policy</tt> command, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ az keyvault set-policy --name my-key-vault --object-id  --secret-permissions get</code></pre>

<p>You can do this in one step if you are building your infrastructure using deployment tools such as Azure Resource Manager (ARM) or Terraform.</p>
<h2 id="during-development">During development</h2>
<p>The third type of credential is for local development. If you have an appropriately configured developer workstation with <a href="https://visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio</a> signed in to Azure, then the Azure credentials from your tools will be used. Other tools (such as the Azure CLI, PowerShell, and Visual Studio Code) will be added in the near future. This allows you to run your service easily from the command line or via F5 within Visual Studio.</p>

<p>This gives you a great ability to build and run your application without any code changes. You don’t need anything else. However, if your account does not have access to the resources necessary for the app to run, you can override the information by creating a service principal in the tenant that owns the resources (or giving your account permissions to use the resources), then use the environment variables that I mentioned above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can use the App Configuration service to store the list of resources that your application needs. Create a set of keys with a “dev” label and a second set of keys with the same names labelled “prod”. Your app can then read the keys with the appropriate label to get the names of the right resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-final-stop-interactive-browser">The final stop: Interactive browser</h2>
<p>If all of these mechanisms for obtaining a credential fail, the <tt>DefaultAzureCredential</tt> will attempt to pop up a browser window and ask for the right credentials. Some languages enable the interactive browser by default, whereas others require that you enable it first. For example, .NET only enables the interactive browser by passing <tt>true</tt> to the constructor of the <tt>DefaultAzureCredential</tt>. If the interactive browser is not popping up, check the documentation.</p>

<h2 id="take-your-app-from-development-to-production-with-no-code-changes">Take your app from development to production with no code changes</h2>
<p>Let's take an example. I'm writing a backend service right now that consists of a Node.js API service that communicates with Cosmos DB and Azure Storage. I store the base URI for Azure Storage and the connection string for Cosmos DB in Azure Key Vault secrets, and specify the URI needed to access the Key Vault as an environment variables. This allows me to run the service locally, as an App Service, or in a container.</p>

<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> SecretClient <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@azure/keyvault-secrets'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> DefaultAzureCredential <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@azure/identity'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> CosmosClient <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@azure/cosmos'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> keyVaultUrl <span>=</span> process<span>.</span><span>env</span><span>(</span><span>'APP_KEY_VAULT_URI'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> credential <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>DefaultAzureCredential</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> storageClient<span>;</span>
<span>let</span> cosmosClient<span>;</span>

<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>configureClients</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> kvClient <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SecretClient</span><span>(</span>keyVaultUrl<span>,</span> credential<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> storageUri <span>=</span> <span>await</span> client<span>.</span><span>getSecret</span><span>(</span><span>'storageUri'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> cosmosDbConnectionString <span>=</span> <span>await</span> client<span>.</span><span>getSecret</span><span>(</span><span>'cosmosDb'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    cosmosClient <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>CosmosClient</span><span>(</span>cosmosDbConnectonString<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    storageClient <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>BlobServiceClient</span><span>(</span>storageUri<span>,</span> credential<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

<p>When I run my app from my development environment, it uses the credentials from my tooling. If I don’t have any appropriate tooling, the app will pop up a browser to get the credentials. I can bypass this process by creating a service principal and ensuring the permissions are set properly.</p>

<p>When my development is complete, I may pass this onto a devops group that deploys the service to one of the compute environments. They are using the best practices for the cloud, explicitly using managed identities and setting permissions during the deployment phase. My code doesn’t need any changes.</p>

<p>Most importantly, at no time does any security information get checked into source code. Using the <tt>DefaultAzureCredential</tt> helps you to avoid credential leakage.</p>

<p>If you are building modern cloud-native apps on Azure, the <tt>DefaultAzureCredential</tt> is the best and easiest way to handle identity, authentication, and authorization.</p>
