I‚Äôm going to be honest with you: I think cryptography is incredibly important
and I value it, but it‚Äôs not something I like reading about. Fortunately, my
friend <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptodavidw">David Wong</a> is writing a book that
focuses on the actionable things you need to know, is diagram heavy, and isn‚Äôt
all proofs. This will probably be a pretty cool book.

<p><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/data-transformation-with-vault/">Encrypting Data while Preserving Formatting with the Vault Enterprise Transform Secrets Engine</a><br>
‚ÄúVault 1.4 Enterprise introduced a new secrets engine called Transform.
Transform is a secrets engine that allows Vault to encode and decode sensitive
values residing in external systems such as databases or file systems. The
Transform engine allows you to ensure that when a system is compromised, and its
data is leaked, that the encoded secrets remain uncompromised even when held by
an adversary. Unlike the Transit secrets engine, with Transform you can encrypt
data while preserving the original formatting.‚Äù</p>

<div><p>Pro-tip: they
bypass the headache of supporting many different definition file formats (e.g.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mboehme_/status/1278712066887397378">Overview of 7 years of fuzzing papers</a><br>
Really neat thread by Marcel B√∂hme laying out the motivations and contributions
of papers from his research group. If I could get one of these for every lab
group I‚Äôd be so happy üòç Here‚Äôs a taste:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My first technical paper introduced a technique that could, in principle,
<em>prove</em> that no bug was introduced by a new code commit
<a href="https://mboehme.github.io/paper/ICSE13.pdf">ICSE‚Äô13</a>. This was also the first
of several symbolic execution-based whitebox fuzzers [FSE‚Äô13, ASE‚Äô16,
ICSE‚Äô20].</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet, something was amiss. Even a simple random input generator could
outperform my most effective whitebox fuzzer if it generated inputs fast
enough. To understand why, we modelled fuzzing as a sampling process and
proved some bounds [FSE‚Äô14,
<a href="https://mboehme.github.io/paper/TSE15.pdf">TSE‚Äô15</a>].</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not often you come across research that might fundamentally, scalably, push
security forward. This ambitious project from Microsoft Research might be one of them.</p>

<p>One thing I like about it is that they come at the problem from an <em>economics</em> angle.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs huge economic upside for attackers to build malware that cannot be
detected, as they can continue to use it across many victims. Thus, the
economics of reuse justify enormous attacker investment in malware
non-discoverability.</p>

<p>Conversely, once a malware strain is discovered, it‚Äôs value plummets
corresponding to how effectively it can still be used.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The question for defenders, then, is how can we <strong>raise the cost</strong> of
non-discovery? Is there a point beyond which a class of malware is <strong>no longer
economically viable</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rest of the post describes Project Freta
(<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/research/project-freta/">docs</a>),
which can capture and analyze full VM memory snapshots without the tells that
enable malware to know it‚Äôs been observed and self-destruct or evade detection.
Project Freta can batch process 10,000+ live VMs without disrupting their
execution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some kernel hooking identification is performed automatically; this can be
used by analysts to detect novel rootkits.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of interest to defenders: debugging relationships are provided to allow for
investigation of counter-debugging techniques; library imports are listed to
allow for investigation of LD_PRELOAD based attacks; and simple hooking of
systems calls is detected and mapped.</p>

<h2 id="-searching-for-the-ultimate-obstacle-to-creativity">üîç <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/single-thread-unifies-procrastination-training-as-avoidance-toolbox-fallacy/">Searching for the Ultimate Obstacle to Creativity</a><a href="#-searching-for-the-ultimate-obstacle-to-creativity" title="Permalink"><span>Permalink</span><i></i></a></h2>

<p>True story: as I was starting tl;dr sec, I spent ~4-6 weeks evaluating various
static site generators and themes. Yes, you heard me correctly - I
spent over a month researching before I had written <em>a single post</em>.</p>

<p>Writing is hard. And stressful. One of the best (and every Wednesday, worst)
things that‚Äôs happened to me is deciding to send out tl;dr sec weekly. It is an
invaluable forcing function.</p>

<p>In this excellent post by <a href="https://twitter.com/danielmiessler">Daniel Miessler</a>,
he connects a number of, on the surface, disparate procrastination mechanisms
with the same underlying cause(s). Procrastination can be a self-defense
mechanism- it distracts us from the fact that we haven‚Äôt made the progress we
wanted to, that other people have done so much more, from other prior pain, etc.</p>

<p>Daniel discusses 3 distinct mechanisms:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Training as Avoidance</strong> - Studying a craft instead of just doing it.</li>
  <li><strong>The Toolbox Fallacy</strong> - Waiting for a tool or life condition before we can start pursuing our dreams.</li>
  <li><strong>Procrastination</strong> - Distracting ourselves from prior trauma or pain.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://tldrsec.com/assets/images/tldr_sec/042/miessler_never_become_true_self.png" alt="Daniel Miessler: Never Become Your True Self Stack"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don‚Äôt try to fix your creator problems with even more study, or even better
tools. Instead, look yourself right in the face, and tell yourself the
following.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You are awesome. You are creative. You are capable. You are loved. And you
are going to be awesome.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know that you can be a great creator. I believe in you. And you should too.</p>

  <p>Go <strong>do it</strong>.</p>
