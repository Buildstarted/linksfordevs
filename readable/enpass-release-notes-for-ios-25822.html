<li><strong>CRASH ON iOS 9</strong>: Enpass was crashing on iOS devices running iOS 9.x. Now Fixed.</li>

<h3>Version 6.0.0</h3>
<p>Release Date December 28, 2018</p>
<p><strong>What‚Äôs New:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New, Exciting UI</strong>: You will jump for joy to see your loving Enpass in all new shape ‚Äòn‚Äô design. Loads of features packed right in the tab bar to make it more easy for you to access data, autofill items and more. Alas! The sidebar just died yesterday for better future.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Vaults</strong>: We are very excited to have support of more than one vault in Enpass to collaborate with our family and team members, keeping our personal data separate in Primary vault. It was, one of the most demanded features from you guys. You can share a vault with others by syncing through a common cloud account where each vault need a distinct cloud account to sync. Just go ahead, and give it a try!</li>
<li><strong>Secure Sharing</strong>: Every single item that you want to share with others can now be encrypted with a passphrase (call it Pre-Shared Key). You can create PSKs from the Advanced Settings of Enpass after which an additional option to Encrypt with PSK will appear while sharing the item. You need to share the PSK in prior with the intended recipient to enable them to import in their Enpass. Please use a different medium to share the PSK than you‚Äôll use to share the item. -‚ÄúKeys are always kept hidden from the locks‚Äù ;-).</li>
<li><strong>Keyfile Support</strong>: You want to have super-duper strong master password, huh! Yeah, but memory has a limit to memorize it. No worries, you can use Enpass 6 to let you use Enpass-Keyfile in addition to your master password as a second factor required to unlock the Enpass on every platform.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Icons</strong>: Let‚Äôs you set any image as an icon for an item.</li>
<li><strong>Trash &amp; Archive</strong>: You know what to do with Trash. Archive those unwanted items which should be skipped while Searching.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Type Support</strong>: Ahem! Users, who like to see their favorite apps supporting their preferred text size where iOS switches fonts automatically as needed, have an extra reason to clap for us. ‚Ä¶ We heard it, thank-you!</li>
<li><strong>Identities</strong>: Create identities with personal information for auto-filling long, tedious sign-up forms with a single click.</li>
<li><strong>Autocopy TOTP to Clipboard</strong>: Enpass can now auto copy the TOTP, just after filling the login details and you can paste that right in there. Go and set 2-step verification on all your logins.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Line Field</strong>: It‚Äôs a new field type where you can save data in multiple-lines.</li>
<li><strong>History of Every Field</strong>‚Äì Like password fields, you can now see history of changes in every kind of fields in an item except Notes.</li>
<li>A separate section under ‚ÄòGroups‚Äô tab to have a quick look on all TOTPs &amp; Attachments.</li>
<li>Added localization support for Afrikaans, Malay, Croatian, Hungarian, Indonesian, Romanian, Slovak and Swedish.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved Security</strong>: The real stuff!! Enpass 6 comes with far better protection for your data. Check out more about Security on our website.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Support for Rtl Languages</strong>: Sorry for the trouble that our beloved Enpassians of Arabic and Hebrew language systems had to go through in previous version. Now time for you to be on cloud nine. Just check this version and let us know how we worked.</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong>: Folders in previous Enpass were more or like Tags and so we have renamed them to Tags. And yes, they are nested too.</li>
<li>Improved Password generator and more brutal strength estimator. Again, Security Matters the most!</li>
<li><strong>Password Expiry</strong>: From now onwards you can set an expiry date to any password field and check for them from ‚ÄòAudit‚Äô tab, when they are going to expire.</li>
<li>Eight digits TOTP support.</li>
<li>Unlike older version, Password generator has no limitation of five passwords in history.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 5.6.1</h3>
<p>Release Date September 26, 2018</p>
<p><strong>Fixes:</strong></p>

</ul>
<h3>Version 5.6.0</h3>

<p><strong>What‚Äôs New:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Password Autofill</strong>:&nbsp;Apple has introduced the built-in support for password autofilling in apps and browsers using the third party password managers, and now you do not need to switch to Enpass to copy the login details in apps. By enabling the Password autofill in iOS, you can now autofill your login details saved in Enpass, in a go. To enable go to <em>Device Settings &gt; ‚ÄúPasswords &amp; Accounts‚Äù &gt; ‚ÄúAutofill Passwords‚Äù and select Enpass.</em></li>
<li><strong>Siri Shortcuts</strong>: Another really exciting thing in iOS 12 is that you can open shortcuts in apps for Siri to perform a specific action in that app. What else could have been more helpful in situations, when we have to immediately look into Enpass for an item. Now you can tell Siri to do that for you.<br>
Just define custom phrases in Enpass for the items you frequently use, using the option ‚ÄúAdd to Siri‚Äù; then record your command and it‚Äôs done. Next time when you need to peek into any item, just ask Siri to open that item using your recorded phrase.</li>

<li><strong>Option to disable update and analytics:&nbsp;</strong>We have added an option under Advanced Preferences to restrict Enpass to connect to the Internet for checking of updates, sending analytics and crash reports. Though we recommend you to not disable the option to check for updates and notification as this is the only way we can convey any important message to you.
