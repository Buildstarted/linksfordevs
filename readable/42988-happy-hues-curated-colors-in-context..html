That combined by with the fact that red is very attention grabbing, you see red used in the branding of pretty much all fast food chains.</p><p class="sticky-card__tag-title">Often associated with</p></div><div data-w-id="7c9cdc53-0ee2-6b73-f31e-a1d2cecc15c4" class="sticky-card"><p class="stick-card__copy">It's all about the sun, baby! Yellow is a bright &amp; energizing color that evokes feelings of happiness &amp; positivity. It also grabs your attention, so it makes for a great call to action, and it's why you'll see it used as warning signs or combined with red in basically all fast food logos.</p><p class="stick-card__copy">But just a heads up, studies have shown that the color yellow can trigger the anxiety centers of the brain, so don't go painting your walls a saturated yellow unless you want a short temper and crying babies.</p><p class="sticky-card__tag-title">Often associated with</p></div><div data-w-id="7c9cdc53-0ee2-6b73-f31e-a1d2cecc15de" class="sticky-card"><p class="stick-card__copy">Blue is a very calming color and can actually slow your metabolism (notice how there's little to no food brands that use blue in their branding). It's a broadly appealing color, which is why global companies like Facebook &amp; Twitter use it for their logos. Although it is a broadly appealing color, it tends to be favored by men, with over 50% of men studied saying blue was their favorite color.</p><p class="sticky-card__tag-title">Often associated with</p></div><div data-w-id="7c9cdc53-0ee2-6b73-f31e-a1d2cecc15f8" class="sticky-card"><p class="stick-card__copy">Green is the color of nature. It's soothing on the eyes and can promote healing... Seriously, it can lower your blood pressure, calm your mind and also suppress your appetite. Green is a great choice is your brand is associated with nature, health or money.</p><p class="sticky-card__tag-title">Often associated with</p></div><div data-w-id="7c9cdc53-0ee2-6b73-f31e-a1d2cecc1612" class="sticky-card"><p class="stick-card__copy">Orange is the less aggressive baby brother of red. It's highly visible (though less so than red) which is why you'll see it used in construction and safety hunting equipment. It makes for a great call to action.</p><p class="sticky-card__tag-title">Often associated with</p></div><div data-w-id="7c9cdc53-0ee2-6b73-f31e-a1d2cecc162c" class="sticky-card"><p class="stick-card__copy">Purple thinks it's better than all the other peasant colors. Lol, just kidding ;) Purple just has a history of being the color of superiority, being used by royalty to flaunt their position &amp; power. It's associated with power, nobility, prestige &amp; luxury. Purple can fall on both the warm and the cool side of the color wheel depending on how much red vs blue is added.</p><p class="sticky-card__tag-title">Often associated with</p></div><div data-w-id="7c9cdc53-0ee2-6b73-f31e-a1d2cecc1646" class="sticky-card"><p class="stick-card__copy">White is the blank canvas color that has all sorts of meanings to it. It's connected to cleanliness, virtue, purity, innocence... In North American cultures that is. In other parts of the world it can have an opposite meaning.</p><p class="stick-card__copy">White pairs great with basically any color on the spectrum. It has high contrast with pretty much all other colors and allows other colors to shine through, so it's a great choice for background colors.</p><p class="sticky-card__tag-title">Often associated with</p></div><div data-w-id="7c9cdc53-0ee2-6b73-f31e-a1d2cecc1660" class="sticky-card last"><p class="stick-card__copy">Black is a very powerful color... Well kind of. Black is the absence of color (ie light), which means it is not really a color itself. It has very high contrast, especially with white, so it's a popular color to use on the web.</p><p class="sticky-card__tag-title">Often associated with</p></div></div></div></div></div>
