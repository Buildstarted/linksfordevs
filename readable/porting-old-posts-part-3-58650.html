		<p data-adtags-visited="true">I‚Äôm continuing in my efforts to move and update all my old content from my MSDN blog to ericlippert.com. Today, posts from early October of 2003.</p>

<p data-adtags-visited="true">The late-binding code designed for OLE Automation was pretty good, and quite novel for its time, but there were a few problems. The whole idea of late binding is that the caller does not have to know the details of the callee; the fact that the caller must know whether the calling convention is in-out vs out to avoid a memory leak is unfortunate.</p>

<p data-adtags-visited="true">What‚Äôs the difference between an empty sack and not having a sack at all? Programming languages often conflate these concepts, but separating them, as VB did, is quite confusing also.</p>

<p data-adtags-visited="true">Once again we return to the many problems of software horology; this episode features commentary from Microsoft notable Raymond Chen, and Brendan Eich, the original designer of JavaScript and later CEO of Mozilla who stepped down after supporting anti-equality initiatives in California; he called the characterization of JavaScript as ‚Äúscripting for Java objects‚Äù as a ‚Äúscam‚Äù, which I found <em>astonishing</em>&nbsp;at the time.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">To clarify: I was fully aware for many years prior that JS was not <em>originally</em> designed to be ‚Äúscripting for Java‚Äù, and that the languages did not have much in common beyond superficial syntactic details; that was all well-understood by all participants in the design process. The part that I found astonishing was the characterization of it as <em>scam</em>; that is, a <em>deliberate attempt to mislead developers for profit. </em></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Now that I think about it, I still find it pretty astonishing.</p>

<a href="https://ericlippert.com/2003/10/07/spot-the-defect/">Spot the defect</a></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Successfully pausing a program for some interval is surprisingly complicated, particularly in a world before asynchronous workflows were built into popular languages. Trying to spot defects in a poor implementation demonstrates the sorts of problems you can easily run into if you‚Äôre not careful.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">It also shows how strongly pausing a program must be tied in to the execution model of the host; this theme recurs in ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I create the WScript object?‚Äù</p>
<hr>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">These four posts seem unrelated but now that I look back, they have a common thread:</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><a href="https://ericlippert.com/2003/10/01/for-in-revisited/">For-in revisited</a></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Though ostensibly about looping constructs, the takeaway here really should have been that common tasks which are tedious or error-prone for developers should be in the libraries or language.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><a href="https://ericlippert.com/2003/10/02/lets-get-explicit/">Let‚Äôs get explicit!</a></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Some languages are <em>do-what-I-mean</em> languages, and some are <em>do-what-I-say</em> languages. There are pros and cons of both. This has consequences for language design.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><a href="https://ericlippert.com/2003/10/08/why-cant-i-create-the-wscript-object/">Why can‚Äôt I create the WScript object?</a><br>
<a href="https://ericlippert.com/2003/10/08/wsc-vs-wsh/">WSC vs WSH</a></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Even after working on or near scripting languages for, at this point, seven years, at this point I still did not understand just how deep the ‚Äúdo what I mean‚Äù ethos runs in developers who primarily write administration scripts.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Worse, I lacked both the ‚Äúbeginner mind‚Äù of people who are coming to a complex system for the first time, and an appreciation of how unnecessarily confusing the alphabet soup of scripting technologies was for beginners and experienced professionals alike. I learned a lot from these frustrated user comments.</p>

<p data-adtags-visited="true">Lots more to come!</p>
