We have almost completely stopped making changes to the product code, but we are still actively monitoring feedback for any important bugs that may be reported. So please install the previews to validate that all the functionality required by your applications is available and works correctly, and <strong>report any issues you find</strong> to either the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/new">EF Core issue tracker</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework6/issues/new">EF 6 issue tracker</a> on GitHub.</p><p>Even if we may not be able to fix many more issues in EF Core 3.0 at this point, we’ll consider important bugs and regressions for the upcoming 3.1 release.</p><p>See the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-entity-framework-core-3-0-preview-9-and-entity-framework-6-3-preview-9/" rel="nofollow">preview 9 announcement blog post</a> for more general information as well as information specific to preview 9.</p><h2>Consider installing daily builds</h2><p>In Preview 9 the functionality of the in-memory provider is still very limited, but this is already fixed in our daily builds. In fact, we have already fixed more than 20 issues that aren’t included in Preview 9, and we may still fix a few more before RTM.</p><p>Detailed instructions to install daily builds, including the necessary NuGet feeds, can be found in the <a href="github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/master/docs/DailyBuilds.md">How to get daily builds of ASP.NET Core</a> article.</p><h2>What are we doing now?</h2><p>Now that 3.0 is wrapping up, the EF team is transitioning to working on:</p><ul><li>Bug fixes for 3.1.
<ul><li>3.1 will be a LTS (Long Term Support) release, so we're stabilizing and fixing bugs for this release</li><li>3.1 will not have new features without .NET Director-level approval</li></ul></li><li>Technical debt
<ul><li>Code cleanup, additional testing, test reliability, etc.</li></ul></li><li>Documentation
<ul><li>Updating docs to be cover changes in the 3.0 release</li><li>An overhaul of the getting started docs to make them more approachable/easier to follow</li><li>Re-organization of docs to make things easier to find and to add cross-references</li><li>Adding more details and clarifications to existing docs</li><li>Updating the samples and adding more examples</li></ul></li><li>Planning and process improvements</li></ul><h2>Pull requests from the last week</h2><h3>EF Core</h3><h3>Documentation</h3><h2>Community contributions</h2><p>Community contributions to documentation:</p><p>Many thanks to <a class="user-mention" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/ronnelsantiago/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/ronnelsantiago">@ronnelsantiago</a> for their contribution!</p><h2>Issues remaining for 3.0</h2><p>This is the burn-down chart we use internally to track progress towards EF Core 3.0. Some observations:</p><ul><li>The gray bar at the top represents all the issues already fixed for 3.0 - we are now at <strong>551</strong> issues fixed!</li><li>We are not planning anything else for 3.0, but high-priority fixes may still make it to the release with director-level approval</li></ul><p>(You may be wondering why the count of issues fixed in 3.0 keeps going up even though we are done with 3.0. This is because we have a lot of issues that we think are fixed for 3.0, but which we haven't verified as fixed. Once we have verified that an issue has been fixed in 3.0, then we move that closed issue into the 3.0 milestone to reflect this.)</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1430078/64385944-a80a7580-cfec-11e9-9d1f-ec695c536f8c.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1430078/64385944-a80a7580-cfec-11e9-9d1f-ec695c536f8c.png" alt="image"></a></p><h2>Major areas</h2><p>While engineers frequently work on multiple things in parallel, these are the high-level areas that we are focusing on for the EF Core 3.0 release.</p><h3>Query pipeline overhaul (Done)</h3><p>What: The way LINQ queries are translated is getting a major overhaul for EF Core 3.0. Part of this involves removal of automatic client evaluation, except in the final projection.</p><p>Status:</p><ul><li>We are done with planned work for 3.0.
