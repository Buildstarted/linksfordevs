		<p>Anyone who knows me knows that I was among the biggest Apple Evangelists to ever live.</p>
<p>Apple was in my DNA.<span>&nbsp; </span>I believed in Apple’s products, Apple’s services, and Apple’s mission (or at least what they said their mission was).<span>&nbsp; </span>I was an Apple employee for nearly 13 years, and I loved helping people get the most out of their Apple products.<span>&nbsp; </span>All of that ended about 6 months ago when Apple showed me its true colors.</p>
<p>In late January I decided to help an elderly friend with a data migration at home.<span>&nbsp; </span>He had just bought a new iMac and needed to transfer the data from his old one to his new one.<span>&nbsp; </span>Apple offers free data transfers, but my friend didn’t want to leave both of his machines with Apple for 3 to 5 days in order for them to do it.</p>
<p>About 2 weeks later I was approached by my boss.<span>&nbsp; </span>Someone told him that I had helped a friend with his computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>I told him that yes I had in fact helped a friend with a data transfer (something Apple does for free) and that I had helped him on my own time.<span>&nbsp; </span>He told me that I had just admitted to a major conflict on interest, and that an official investigation in to my actions would now start, two days later I was suspended.<span>&nbsp; </span>Six days after that I receive a letter in the mail informing me that my actions were in violation of Apple’s business conduct policy, specifically their conflict of interest policy, and that my services were no longer required.</p>
<p>About 20 minutes after I received certified letter in the mail I received a phone call from my now former bosses.<span>&nbsp; </span>They asked me how I was feeling about the news I just got in the mail and if I was ok.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the time I had nothing relevant to say to them. &nbsp;I had just been fired for helping someone, what was it they wanted me to say?</p>
<p>Well, thanks to COVID I’ve had the past 6 months to think about it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here’s what I have to say:</p>
<p>Apple is a company that holds itself out as a company that cares; that “Thinks Different”. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Their current recruiting video states: “To the constant beginners who sing off key against the beat.<span>&nbsp; </span>To those unfamiliar with convention, unmoved by rules, and reborn with every new discovery.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those open to daydreams and night dreams and visions and mirages.<span>&nbsp; </span>Who can see the millions shades of green in a field of grass.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whose days are filled with mysteries that cannot be solved with facts.<span>&nbsp; </span>You are more powerful than you think… …and you are welcome here.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I can tell you that based on my final experience with Apple that they are anything but open to those with new ideas or those who go against the status quo.<span>&nbsp; </span>If any of that was true they wouldn’t have fired me for helping a customer.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I spent 24 years (3/4 of my life!) learning and knowing and loving Apple.<span>&nbsp; </span>I lived it, I breathed it, I bled it, and I worked for it for almost 13 years.<span>&nbsp; </span>I did everything I could to hold Apple in the highest regard.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ve collected just about everything Apple has ever made, and I’ve subscribed to every service that they’ve offered.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now it sickens me to think that I built my entire life on the lie that Apple is.</p>

<p><span>What can I do about it?</span></p>
<p>I can start by telling Apple this:<span>&nbsp; </span>Your services are no longer required.</p>
<p>I’m going to start by never buying a new Apple product again.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m going to unsubscribe from all paid Apple Services.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because I won’t be buying any new Apple devices, I won’t ever need<span>&nbsp; </span>AppleCare or AppleCare+ again, I can easily build my own cloud storage instead of paying for extra iCloud storage, I’ve can subscribe to Spotify for music instead of paying for Apple Music (by the way, Spotify can even be used on PowerPC Macs, Apple Music can’t), I can play all the games that are not on Apple Arcade, I can watch all of the Television shows that aren’t on AppleTV+, and I can get my news from sources other than Apple News+.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Final thoughts</span></p>
<p>Apple is not the company the same company it was when I first fell in love with them, Apple is now a company that (as of the moment I’m writing this) is worth $1,967,000,000,000. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In my opinion Apple has become the kind of company that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-the-ios-app-store/#36bf0fdd6e7b">bullies App developers by removing their Apps from its App Store</a> when they don’t want to pay them a significant cut of their profits, <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354644">sues tiny businesses for copyright infringement</a> because they don’t want them to use a logo that looks nothing like their own, and fires its most loyal employees for daring to help someone in need.<span>&nbsp; </span>These aren’t the actions of a company that cares about its customers, employees, and the communities it serves;<span>&nbsp; </span>they’re the actions of Mobsters shaking down the little guy for protection money and snuffing out anyone they just don’t happen to like.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I no longer want anything to do with them.</p>
