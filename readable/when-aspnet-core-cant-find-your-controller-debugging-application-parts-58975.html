<p>In this post I describe application parts and how ASP.NET Core uses them to find the controllers in your app. I then show how you can retrieve the list at runtime for debugging purposes.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-a-missing-controller">Debugging a missing controller<a href="#debugging-a-missing-controller"></a></h2>
<p>A while ago I was converting an ASP.NET application to ASP.NET Core. The solution had many class library projects, where each project represented a module or vertical slice of the application. These modules contained everything for that feature: the database code, the domain, and the Web API controllers. There was then a "top level" application that referenced all these modules and served the requests. </p>
<p>As the whole solution was based on Katana/Owin and used Web API controllers exclusively, it wasn't too hard to convert it to ASP.NET Core. But, of course, there were bugs in the conversion process. One thing that had me stumped for a while was why the controllers from some of the modules didn't seem to be working. All of the requests to certain modules were returning 404s.</p>
<p>There were a few possibilities in my mind for what was going wrong:</p>
<ol>
<li>There was a routing issue, so requests meant for the controllers were not reaching them</li>
<li>There was a problem with the controllers themselves, meaning they were generating 404s</li>
<li>The ASP.NET Core app wasn't aware of the controllers in the module at all. </li>
</ol>
<p>My gut feeling was the problem was either 1 or 3, but I needed a way to check. The solution I present in this post let me rule out point 3, by listing all the <code>ApplicationPart</code>s and controllers the app was aware of.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-application-parts-">What are application parts?<a href="#what-are-application-parts-"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/advanced/app-parts?view=aspnetcore-3.1">According the documentation: </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An <em>Application Part</em> is an abstraction over the resources of an MVC app. Application Parts allow ASP.NET Core to discover controllers, view components, tag helpers, Razor Pages, razor compilation sources, and more</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Application Parts allow you to share the same resources (controllers, Razor Pages etc) between multiple apps. If you're familiar with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/ui-class?view=aspnetcore-3.1&amp;tabs=visual-studio">Razor Class Libraries</a>, then think of application parts as being the abstraction behind it.</p>

<img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2020/app_parts.png" alt="Image of application parts added to an application">
</picture>
<p>One application part implementation is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.applicationparts.assemblypart?view=aspnetcore-3.1">an <code>AssemblyPart</code></a> which is an application part associated with an assembly. This is the situation I had in the app I described previously - each of the module projects was compiled into a separate <code>Assembly</code>, and then added to the application as application parts.</p>
<p>You can add application parts in <code>ConfigureServices</code> when you configure MVC. The current assembly is added automatically, but you can add additional application parts too. The example below adds the assembly that contains <code>TestController</code> (which resides in a different project) as an application part.</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    services
        <span>.</span><span>AddControllers</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>AddApplicationPart</span><span>(</span><span>typeof</span><span>(</span>TestController<span>)</span><span>.</span>Assembly<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that in ASP.NET Core 3.x, when you compile an assembly that references ASP.NET Core, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.applicationparts.applicationpartattribute?view=aspnetcore-3.1">an assembly attribute is added to the output, <code>[ApplicationPart]</code></a>. ASP.NET Core 3.x apps look for this attribute on referenced assemblies and registers them as application parts automatically, so the code above isn't necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We've covered how you register application parts, but how do we debug when things go wrong? </p>
<h2 id="providing-features-with-the-applicationpartmanager">Providing features with the ApplicationPartManager<a href="#providing-features-with-the-applicationpartmanager"></a></h2>
<p>When you add an application part (or when ASP.NET Core adds it automatically), it's added to the <code>ApplicationPartManager</code>. <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/6255c1ed960f5277d2e96ac2d0968c2c7e844ce2/src/Mvc/Mvc.Core/src/ApplicationParts/ApplicationPartManager.cs">This class</a> is responsible for keeping track of all the application parts in the app, and for populating various <em>features</em> based on the registered parts, in conjunction with registered <em>feature providers</em>.</p>
<p>There are a variety of <em>features</em> used in MVC, such as the <code>ControllerFeature</code> and <code>ViewsFeature</code> for example. <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/6255c1ed960f5277d2e96ac2d0968c2c7e844ce2/src/Mvc/Mvc.Core/src/Controllers/ControllerFeature.cs">The <code>ControllerFeature</code> (shown below)</a> contains a list of all the controllers available to an application, across all of the registered application parts.</p>

<p>To quickly work out whether my <code>404</code> problem was due to routing or missing controllers, I needed to interrogate the <code>ApplicationPartManager</code>. If the application parts and controllers for the problematic modules were missing, then that was the problem; if they were present, then it was probably some sort of routing issue!</p>
<p>To debug the issue I wrote a quick <code>IHostedService</code> that logs the application parts added to an application, along with all of the controllers discovered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used an <code>IHostedService</code> because it runs after application part discovery, and only executes once on startup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The example below takes an <code>ILogger</code> and the <code>ApplicationPartManager</code> as dependencies. It then lists the names of the application parts, populates an instance of the <code>ControllerFeature</code>, and lists all the controllers known to the app. These are written to a log message which can be safely inspected </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/advanced/app-parts?view=aspnetcore-3.1#display-available-features">A similar example in the documentation</a> exposes this information via a Controller, which seems like a bit of a bad idea to me!</p>

<p>The example log message below is taken from <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/blog-examples/tree/master/ApplicationPartsDebugging">the sample code</a>, in which an API project (<em>ApplicationPartsDebugging.Api</em>) references a class library (<em>ApplicationPartsDebugging.Controllers</em>) which contains a controller, <code>TestController</code>. </p>

</code></pre>
<p>Both the API app and the class library are referenced as application parts, and controllers from both application parts are available. </p>
<p>And yes, this was exactly the problem I had during my conversion, I'd failed to register one of the modules as an application part, shown by it's absence from my log message!</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary"></a></h2>
<p>In this post I described a problem I faced when converting an application to ASP.NET Core - the controllers from a referenced project could not be found. ASP.NET Core looks for controllers, views, and other features in <em>application parts</em> that it knows about. You can add additional application parts to an ASP.NET Core manually, though ASP.NET Core 3.x will generally handle this for you automatically. To debug my problem I created an <code>ApplicationPartsLogger</code> that lists all the registered application parts for an app. This allows you to easily spot when an expected assembly is missing.</p>
