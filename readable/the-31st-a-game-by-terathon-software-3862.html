    <p><img src="http://the31stgame.com/heading/about.jpg" alt="About">

	<img src="http://the31stgame.com/gus.png" alt="Gus Graves"></p><p><i>The 31st</i> is a humorous, Halloween-themed first-person shooter that takes place in a strange world filled with endless hordes of
	blood-thirsty monsters and wacky situations. The game consists of six large levels containing wide-open outdoor spaces, spooky dungeon
	corridors, and everything in between. The game is not just about mindlessly killing all the creatures of the night. It also offers a sizable
	element of treasure hunting and exploration as you learn more about the mysteries left behind by people who visited before you.</p>

	<p><i>The 31st</i> is being independently developed by <a href="http://terathon.com/">Terathon Software</a> for Windows and PlayStation&nbsp;4.
	We are using our own technology, the <a href="http://tombstoneengine.com/">Tombstone Engine</a>.</p>

	<h2>Features</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>The single player game is long. When we say our levels are big and there are lots of things to be done, we mean it!</li>
		<li>There are plenty of secrets to discover, haunted areas to explore, and valuable items to find.</li>
		<li>There is a lot of humor!</li>
		<li>There are many conventional weapons and several crazy fun guns.</li>
		<li>The game has a phenomenal soundtrack! <a href="https://soundcloud.com/the-31st/">Listen on SoundCloud</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Steam</h2>

	<p>The game has been <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=420539022">greenlit on Steam</a>, and that’s where it
	will be available for purchase on desktop platforms.</p>

    <p><img src="http://the31stgame.com/heading/backstory.jpg" alt="Backstory"></p><p>Your name is Gus Graves, and you’re a firefighter in the small town of Timber Valley, where the largest employer is the mysterious
	research division of the MGL Corporation, a powerful and notoriously secretive player in the military-industrial complex. It’s sunset
	on Halloween, and just as you’re getting ready for a stream of trick-or-treaters at home, your chief calls you into the station. There’s a
	massive blaze at the MGL building on the edge of town. You jump off the fire engine as it rolls up to the inferno and gasp not only at the
	incredible size of the fire but at the strange beams of light brilliantly flashing through holes in the building’s crumbling walls. As you
	approach the structure for a closer look, the wall and floor of the building collapse to expose a vast underground chamber where all kinds
	of debris are being pulled into a blinding light at the center of a giant metallic ring. The ground begins to fall beneath your feet, and you
	try to scurry up the steepening slope to escape, but it’s too late. You’re pulled into the device alongside some mangled equipment and the
	bodies of lab technicians who didn’t survive the accident. You see your fire engine gravitating toward you as you accelerate into a tunnel of light.</p>

	<p>After a few seconds, you slam to the ground in a grassy meadow. It’s raining debris and corpses through a portal not far above you. You see the fire engine
	falling toward you and roll out of the way just in time to avoid being crushed. You pull yourself up off the ground and take a look around. You’re not in
	Timber Valley any more. You can see only dense forest in every direction, but there are some dirt paths leading into the woods indicating some kind of recent
	activity by local inhabitants. The portal soon closes, leaving only a bunch of smoldering junk, your wrecked fire engine, and the remains of some unfortunate
	MGL workers behind. You’re on your own.</p>

			In the final level of the game, you reach the goal for episode one: the entrance to the MGL Labs industrial complex. But first, you have to battle
			your way through hordes of little green bastards in dark forests, ancient monuments, and rocky canyons. And the evil spirits guarding the path to
			your final destination are not going to make things easy.
