Stop reading this blog post and go register. I'll wait here.</p> <p>Done? Sweet. </p> <p>It's not the Build we thought it would be, but it's gonna be special. It's BUILD. Marketing says not to use ALL CAPS because it's Microsoft Build for them. For me, it's BUILD. It's BUILD at HOME. It's BUILD for YOU. It's BUILD for US. It's VIRTUAL BUILD. </p> <p>A ton of folks are working hard to make Microsoft Build 2020 something special when it kinda feels like there's not a lot of special stuff happening. </p> <p>It needs to be about humans as much as tech. More than tech. We build (BUILD!) stuff for each other - that's the whole point and sometimes it takes a situation like the one we're in to be reminded of that.</p> <p>What are we building for you this year?</p> <p>Microsoft Build 2020 will be 48 hours starting May 19th at 8am Pacific Time with Satya himself! Then - scandalously - I'm doing the opening keynote with some of my favorite people and wonderful colleagues who will join me in a parade of demos, technical context, continuous learning, innovation, and I'm sure my children will interrupt me even though the calendar is clearly marked BUILD (note the brand-violating ALL CAPS) because "do not disturb" means nothing these days! :)  </p><p>Starting the 19th we'll kick off...</p> <ul> <li><strong>48 hours of continuous learning</strong>  <ul> <li>There's a TON of LIVE content and <strong>everything </strong>will be <strong>recorded </strong>so if you miss something LIVE you can catch up on YOUR schedule.</li></ul> </li><li>We are in your timezone  <ul> <li>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re bringing the experts to you – in your time zone! <strong>We'll do sessions 3 times (spread out every 8 hours) </strong>so you can spend time with the devs and PMs that build the stuff you use every day. No need to stay up until 2am, we'll do it for you. (Don't worry, we'll take the week off after! We're doing this because we love it.)</li></ul> </li><li>Enhance your learning with LIVE sessions - We'll have shorter <strong>and </strong>more LIVE sessions<strong> and then </strong> <ul> <li>Those starter sessions then will have longer recorded on-demand sessions to explore after the event. It's Netfl*x for Nerds.</li></ul> </li><li>Live Q&amp;A with experts  <ul> <li>Be sure to register (don't be anonymous) so you can do LIVE Q&amp;A with the folks in the know</li></ul> </li><li>Community connections  <ul> <li>Sometimes the best track at a conference is the Hallway Track and we want you to spend time with like-minded people in a positive environment so we'll have ways for you to self-organize and step into your own space to share and learn.</li></ul> </li><li><strong>Registering for the event is your all access pass to all sessions</strong>  </li><li>If you're a teacher, we'll even have content for your student and new learners!  </li><li>48 hour workshops with Build on Twitch  <ul> <li>For a change of pace and style, we'll have your favorite Live Coders doing long form workshops (1-3 hours) LIVE on Twitch.</li></ul></li></ul> <p>Whether you've got 30 min, an hour, or you've cleared your schedule and stay up for a few days with us, I know you'll have a great time. Microsoft Build 2020 will be unlike anything *I've* ever be involved in. I'm working hard with my friends to put together an unprecedented Developer Keynote for an unprecedented situation. Better yet, I get to be the <em>opening act </em>for ScottGu (look Ma, I made it), Rajesh Ja, and other Microsoft luminaries far above my pay grade.</p> <p>I'm really proud of what we're working on and I'm looking forward to sharing it with you all.
