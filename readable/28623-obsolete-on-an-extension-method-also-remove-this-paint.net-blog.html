Also remove ‘this’ – paint.net blog</h1><div><div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>tl;dr – To fully deprecate an extension method when you need to maintain binary compatibility (e.g. plugins), especially if it’s colliding with another extension method, you can simply remove the ‘this’ keyword.</em></strong></p><p>I recently needed to remove a duplicate extension method from the Paint.NET code base. I had two copies of a <strong>ServiceProviderExtensions</strong> class, one in the <strong>PaintDotNet</strong> namespace and the other in <strong>PaintDotNet.AppModel</strong> (which I wanted to remove). They both had a <strong>GetService&lt;TService&gt;</strong>() extension method:</p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D-pKgQlUcAABGQp.jpg:large" alt=""></figure><p>The second copy was just an absent-minded addition at some point, but of course … some plugins started using the “wrong” one (there’s no way the plugin authors could’ve known). Worse, if you had a <strong>using</strong> at the top of your C# code file for both namespaces, whether inside the app or out in a plugin, you couldn’t use <em>either</em> of the extension methods because the compiler would give you a “The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties” error.</p><p>Hrumph! So, clearly I wanted to delete one of these. But, how could I do that without breaking plugins? Some were using the first copy, others were using the second copy!</p><p>The first solution I came up with was to create a new DLL, let’s call it <strong>PaintDotNet.Obsolete.dll</strong>. I’d then move the “bad” extension method class into there, add an <strong>[assembly: TypeForwardedTo(…)]</strong> attribute in the original DLL, and add <strong>[Obsolete]</strong> onto the methods in the new (err, obsolete) DLL. I couldn’t add <strong>[Obsolete]</strong> to the class, however, otherwise the <strong>TypeForwardedTo</strong> attribute would get flagged with an error too. This would mostly work, but was messy and clumsy. I may still need to use this idea in the future to cover other deprecation scenarios.</p><p>Finally, it dawned on me: what if I just removed ‘this’ from the extension method signature? This would remove it from IntelliSense, and also remove it as a candidate for extension method resolution <em>at compile time</em>, while still affording binary compatibility with old plugin DLLs.</p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D-pMlyuU0AAnI_Q.jpg:large" alt=""></figure><p>And … it worked!!!</p><p>It works because extension methods and ‘this’ are implemented in the <em>compiler </em>as syntactic sugar. It’s neither a runtime nor a framework feature; once your DLL is compiled, extension methods don’t really exist (at least at the call site).</p><p>The ‘this’ keyword turns into an attribute on the method which identifies it as an extension method. When compiling a DLL that consumes the extension method, the code that’s emitted is a normal static method call. Since I wasn’t removing the static method, the old plugin DLLs would still be able to use it.</p><p>And thus a years-old conundrum has been solved. Old plugins will continue to work, and new plugins (and new app code!) can use the right extension method without the ambiguity error.</p><p><em>This blog post is based on some tweets I made earlier today:  <a href="https://twitter.com/rickbrewPDN/status/1146810316887429120">https://twitter.com/rickbrewPDN/status/1146810316887429120</a></em></p><div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled"><h3 class="jp-relatedposts-headline"><em>Related</em></h3></div></div></div></div></div>
