<p>I am LOVING all things <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-3.1">Blazor</a>! You can probably tell, from <a href="https://exceptionnotfound.net/tag/blazor/">my previous posts about it</a>. The ability to write C# and have it run in the browser is amazing, particularly for those of us who don't like JavaScript very much. </p><p>With the recent <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/blazor-webassembly-3-2-0-now-available/">release of Blazor WebAssembly</a> to general availability in .NET Core 3.2, I've been spending all my free time on building some new models with it. I want to share what I've learned so far, and to do that in a fun way. So, let's build a game.</p><p>Specifically, let's build the venerable computer game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">Minesweeper</a> using Blazor WebAssembly.</p><figure><img src="https://exceptionnotfound.net/content/images/2020/06/Minesweeper_Game_Most_Common_Setup.png" alt=""><figcaption>So close, so close!

We're going to call those pieces "Panels", because that's what they look like.</p><p>Each panel can be either unrevealed (the starting state) or revealed, and once revealed, each panel has either a mine, a number that represents the count of adjacent mines, or a blank space. Further, an unrevealed panel can be "flagged" so that the user cannot accidentally click on it; this is done to mark where the mines likely are.</p><p>Let's create a C# class that has all of these attributes:</p><figure><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Panel</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span><span>int</span></span> ID <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

        X <span>=</span> x<span>;</span>
        Y <span>=</span> y<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><figcaption>For easy access later, we also added an ID field.</figcaption></figure><p>Each panel has two possible actions that can be performed against it: they can be revealed (when clicked), or flagged (when right-clicked).</p><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Panel</span>
<span>{</span>
    

    <span>public</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>Flag</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>As far as the panels are concerned, this is the extent of their functionality. The real work comes next, as we begin to design the game board itself.</p><h4 id="the-board">The Board</h4><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520350094754-f0fdcac35c1c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="more at instagram @joshrh19"><figcaption>Wrong spelling.

Each board has Z mines hidden in its panels. For every panel that is not a mine, a number is placed showing the count of mines adjacent to that panel. &nbsp;We therefore need our GameBoard class to keep track of its own dimensions, mine count, and collection of panels.</p><figure><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>GameBoard</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>int</span></span> Width <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>16</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><figcaption>Note that these settings are for an "intermediate" game of Minesweeper.</figcaption></figure><p>We will be greatly expanding this class as we develop our game.</p><h4 id="game-status">Game Status</h4><p>Because the appearance of the Minesweeper board is determined by the state of the game, we can use an enumeration to track said state.</p><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>enum</span> <span>GameStatus</span>
<span>{</span>
    AwaitingFirstMove<span>,</span>
    InProgress<span>,</span>
    Failed<span>,</span>
    Completed
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>We must also allow the board to track the game state:</p><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>GameBoard</span>
<span>{</span>
    
    
    <span>public</span> <span>GameStatus</span> Status <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Now let's build out the functionality of this board.</p><h4 id="initializing-the-game">Initializing the Game</h4><p>Every game of Minesweeper begins in the same state, with all panels hidden. Let's create a method to initialize a game, including creating the collection of panels. Given the height, width, and mine count as parameters, here's what our initialization method would look like:</p><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>GameBoard</span>
<span>{</span>
    
    
    <span>public</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>Initialize</span><span>(</span><span><span>int</span></span> width<span>,</span> <span><span>int</span></span> height<span>,</span> <span><span>int</span></span> mines<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Width <span>=</span> width<span>;</span>
        Height <span>=</span> height<span>;</span>
        MineCount <span>=</span> mines<span>;</span>
        Panels <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>List<span>&lt;</span>Panel<span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span><span>int</span></span> id <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

        <span>{</span>
            <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span><span>int</span></span> j <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> j <span>&lt;=</span> width<span>;</span> j<span>++</span><span>)</span>
            <span>{</span>
                Panels<span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Panel</span><span>(</span>id<span>,</span> j<span>,</span> i<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
                id<span>++</span><span>;</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>

        Status <span>=</span> GameStatus<span>.</span>AwaitingFirstMove<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>You might be wondering: why didn't we place the mines and calculate the adjacent numbers? That's because of a trick in most implementations of Minesweeper: they don't calculate where the mines are placed until <em>after</em> the user makes the first move. This is so that the user doesn't click on a mine on the first move, because that's no fun.</p><p>For later usage, let's also implement a Reset method, which will reset the board to a new game using the same width, height, and mine count:</p><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>GameBoard</span>
<span>{</span>
    
    
    <span>public</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>Reset</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>Initialize</span><span>(</span>Width<span>,</span> Height<span>,</span> MineCount<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Now we can work on the next major step of this implementation: the first move.</p><h4 id="the-first-move-and-getting-neighbors">The First Move and Getting Neighbors</h4><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1488563191899-79b83cb52fb9?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Engaged couple linking fingers"><figcaption>No, not that kind of first move.

That algorithm looks something like this:</p><ol><li>When the user makes the first move, take that panel and a certain number of neighbor panels, and mark them as unavailable for mines.</li><li>For every other panel, place the mines randomly.</li><li>For every panel which is not a mine (including the panels from Step 1), calculate the adjacent mines.</li><li>Mark the game as started</li></ol><p>The trickiest part of this algorithm is calculating the neighbors of a given panel. Remember that the neighbors of any given panel are the first panel above, below, to the left, to the right, and on each diagonal. </p><figure><img src="https://exceptionnotfound.net/content/images/2020/06/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>C for clicked, N for neighbor.</figcaption></figure><p>For our implementation, we have an entire method to do this:</p><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>GameBoard</span>
