We’re learning lots of new phrases like social distancing, contact tracing, and stop snacking just because you’re bored. Everyone around the world is coming together to do their part, whether that’s working on finding a vaccine, delivering food and supplies, or staying indoors. Whatever the case, all of our daily routines have been thrown completely out of whack. It’s easy to get scared at a time like this, which is why focusing on something can help you stay calm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators around the world are doing everything they can to provide digital lessons for the half a billion students who are out of school due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is not an easy task and we want to do our part to help keep young minds sharp and stimulated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you head over to the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/marketplace" data-bi-id="n1c1c1c1c1c1m2r3a3">Minecraft Marketplace</a>, you will find some of our favorite lessons from Minecraft: Education Edition in a brand new Education category. These educational worlds can be played on your own, with your kids, parents or friends. From the comfort of your home, you can tour the International Space Station or even explore the inside of a human eye. We’ve also included ten worlds from our Marketplace creator community! Thanks to creators <b>Everbloom</b>, <b>Jigarbov</b>, <b>Lifeboat</b>, <b>Razzleberries</b>, <b>The World Foundry</b>, <b>Blockworks</b>, and <b>Imagiverse</b> you can explore renewable energy, marine biology, Greek history, and more! The worlds include lesson plans like creative writing activities, build challenges, and tricky puzzles.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><b>All of these worlds are launching today and are free to download through June 30, 2020.</b></p>
