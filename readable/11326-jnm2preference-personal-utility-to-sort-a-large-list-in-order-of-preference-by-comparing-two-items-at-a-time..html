Ranking most of them was so hard that I wrote this desktop app. It randomly selects pairs of candidates and pulls up the <code>https://election.dotnetfoundation.org/campaign-2019/{nameSlug}.html#site_container</code> pages (linked from <a href="https://election.dotnetfoundation.org/candidates" rel="nofollow">https://election.dotnetfoundation.org/candidates</a>) side by side and records which one I choose. After each choice, if the list isn’t totally ordered yet, it pulls up two more at random. (It retries at random until it finds a pair whose order isn’t already known transitively.) Once a total ordering is achieved, the app lists the names in descending order of preference. All the individual choices that were made are listed underneath.</p><p>Comparing two mission statements at a time made my decisions much clearer. The results feel right.</p><p>I’m also trying out a variant of Redux-style UI state management as a personal experiment. It’s all very ad-hoc.</p><p>To build and run the app, you’ll need to create the file <code>src\Preference\CandidateNames.txt</code> and fill it with one name per line. I gitignored it for obvious reasons.</p><p>The app has served its purpose for me for the time being, so right now I’m not planning to expand it or document it besides what I had time to write here.</p></div></div></div></div>
