<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4>OBJECTIVE: </h4><p>The aim of this study was to examine whether shared and open-plan offices are associated with more days of sickness absence than cellular offices.</p><h4>METHODS: </h4><p>The analysis was based on a national survey of Danish inhabitants between 18-59 years of age (response rate 62%), and the study population consisted of the 2403 employees that reported working in offices. The different types of offices were characterized according to self-reported number of occupants in the space. The log-linear Poisson model was used to model the number of self-reported sickness absence days depending on the type of office; the analysis was adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic status, body mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, and physical activity during leisure time.</p><h4>RESULTS: </h4><p>Sickness absence was significantly related to having a greater number of occupants in the office (P&lt;0.001) when adjusting for confounders. Compared to cellular offices, occupants in 2-person offices had 50% more days of sickness absence [rate ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.13-1.98], occupants in 3-6-person offices had 36% more days of sickness absence (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.08-1.73), and occupants in open-plan offices (&gt;6 persons) had 62% more days of sickness absence (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.30-2.02).</p><h4>CONCLUSION: </h4><p>Occupants sharing an office and occupants in open-plan offices (&gt;6 occupants) had significantly more days of sickness absence than occupants in cellular offices.</p></div></div></div>
