<p>We love to learn about what moves developers and technical workers. That’s why each year, we ask the tech community about their jobs, their tools, and their aspirations. We also love open source, so since 2011, we’ve made the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/">raw data set</a> available for you to explore! We’re happy to announce that this year’s raw data is available for you to peruse at your leisure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note: the survey was fielded from February 5 to February 28 earlier this year, so the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020">2020 results</a> reflect a world before COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, and countries across the world went into lockdown. That said, there are plenty of exciting, interesting, and amusing highlights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This data set is based on a survey of 65,000 professional and aspiring software developers from 186 countries around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we saw a lift in underrepresented groups and an uptick in some race and ethnicity groups, notably those of Latinx and Black or of African descent as well as female-gendered respondents; we acknowledge that we have a lot of work to do to represent all people working with code! The data we obtain in our annual survey helps us make changes and set goals to improve the welcomeness and inclusiveness of our community. You can read more on our methodology <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#methodology">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can dig into the data for yourself and explore respondents’ favorite technologies, opinions on the software industry, and job priorities by downloading the raw data we just added to our <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research">research portal</a>.</p>



<p>In the past we’ve seen this data set used for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/London-Open-Data-Hackathons/events/263226085/">virtual hackathons</a>, <a href="https://glitch.com/glimmer/post/delve-into-the-developer-survey-results-data">interactive visualizations </a>and lots of fresh insight on social media.&nbsp; We’re looking forward to seeing what you build and discover using the public data release of the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Share your thoughts with us using the hashtag #DevSurvey2020. If you use it in an academic paper, we’d love to <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134495/academic-papers-using-stack-exchange-data/134496#134496">add it to our collection</a>.</p>



<p>Note, you are free to share, adapt, and create derivative works from the public 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey results as long as you attribute Stack Overflow, keep the database open (if you redistribute it), and continue to share-alike any adapted database under the <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">ODbL</a>.</p>



<p>Massive, heartfelt thanks to all Stack Overflow contributors and lurking developers of the world who took part in the survey this year. We value your generous participation more than you know. &lt;3</p><p>
