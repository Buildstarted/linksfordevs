              "Having Cory come in during our initial development phase for our
              new app was proven to be a very valuable decision. He pointed us
              toward restructuring our app in a way that we would have never
              thought to do. He cut unnecessary packages that we were very keen
              on using, but ultimately, were not necessary. Cory's expertise was
              not only in the domain of React, but also Webpack, which allowed
              us to refine our development and build processes. He has helped
              build a solid foundation that will be used across future app
              development at VideoAmp."
            </p>
            <h4>David Ung, Front End Engineer at VideoAmp</h4>
            
            <p>
              "Cory is a fantastic teacher. I appreciated his depth of knowledge
              delivered in a humble fashion."
            </p>
            <h4>Stephen Erstad - Software Engineer at Target</h4>
            
            <p>
              "Cory took the time to methodically walk through the key decisions
              we needed to make to create a reusable React development
              environment for our team. He paired with our development team to
              implement a custom solution that suited our unique needs and
              preferences. With Cory's help, we were able to accelerate our
              transition to React using a solid foundation for bundling,
              testing, transpiling, automated builds, and more."
            </p>
            <h4>Jeff Collier, CTO of MobyMax</h4>
            
            <p>
              "Cory is very knowledgeable and most importantly was very adaptive
              to our needs and catered the training as we go. He made the
              sessions engaging and entertaining. He made it a comfortable
              environment to ask questions and gave great direction on what
              technology to use going forward."
            </p>
            <h4>Wilson Zhang, Development Manager at Tideworks Technology</h4>
            
            <p>
              "Cory helped us design our app around a strong seed application.
              This is the sort of thing that we would do on our own, but in such
              a way that would need re-writing, i.e. learning by doing. Creating
              a solid structure, core, ui, theme, and starter, and being highly
              opinionated allowed us to consistently make decisions that benefit
              current AND future developers. Cory helped us design a project
              will "keep the easy problems from becoming hard problems"-- a key
              goal of our team. Cory's wisdom around Redux was a well-needed
              point of view, because we lacked the experience to know that we
              didn't need it for many situations. Opting out of
              Redux-by-default, where we would have also probably overused it,
              will save us a lot of time, headache, and will make the system
              easier to learn and work with."
            </p>
            <h4>Ed Bramanti, Senior Developer at VideoAmp</h4>
            
            <p>
              "Cory is one of the masters of React that I have followed for the
              past few years. He's even better in person, mostly because you get
              a bunch of insights from his experience you don't always get from
              video training, books or online articles."
            </p>
            <h4>Jim Pickering, Senior Web Developer at SkillPath</h4>
            
            <p>
              "Cory discussed multiple ways to do things and why you would chose
              one over another. This will save me a lot of time when I encounter
              those situations. Cory has an openness to discuss and learn while
              presenting. This created a comfortable learning environment for
              individuals to ask questions."
