Especially if they are these <i>really juicy</i> stories (like only 5 people in Europe knowing long division).<p>He has bit of a habit exaggerating and elaborating on stories for the sake of making tasty reading. There was a story in <i>Black Swan</i> about two hospitals and a simple statistical riddle that he claimed professional statisticians would get wrong. It wasn't even a trick question, most people would get it right. I found this hard to believe but I was still sort of surprised when the source spoke of a <i>much</i> harder statistics question that was surveyed at a psychologists convention, not statisticians. That was the first (and the last) source I checked on him. I'd have checked a few more but I don't have the book any more.</p><p>But now I guess I can add this one to the list of examples.

It includes a detailed overview of the archeological evidence, which shows a very clear and dramatic decline in the economy and living standards -- and some areas of technology -- between circa 350 and 600 in the Western Empire. (And the recovery afterwards took centuries.) The <i>Eastern</i> Empire, interestingly, doesn't show any signs of a similar decline until the 7th Century.<p>For example, peasant households in Italy at the height of the empire had a wide variety of well-made pottery, some of it originating from production centers hundreds of miles away, along with tiled roofs; after the collapse, the variety and quality of pottery was greatly reduced, and tiled roofs disappear. (Tiled roofs provide better protection against rain, are less flammable, and require less maintenance and rebuilding than wooden shingles or thatch; but they also require large kilns, lots of clay and fuel, and a good transportation network.)</p><p>And ice cores from Greenland show extensive metalworking going on in Western Europe (in the form of copper and lead pollution carried through the air) during the Roman Empire; after the collapse of the Western Empire, the pollution levels don't return to Roman-era values until the 16th Century.

I think it was also associated with a broader intellectual and infrastructure decline, which in some specific ways and some specific fields didn’t reach back up to its Roman level until the Renaissance. I think that common sense – the sense you get when you treat the question of the Dark Age the same as any other question, and try to avoid isolated demands for rigor – says that qualifies for the phrase “Dark Age”.

                  <p><span>yes. what I wanted to say is that the emperor in Japan had a minor role for the longest time, i.e. it had a middle age that was not unlike Europe, with a steady development of warfare techniques and other parts of culture, as well as a constant trickle of foreign influences. Until edo period, where Tokugawa Shogunate was able to grab all power and basically freeze development and shut down borders. In Meiji, Japan industrialized rapidly under a US-backed emperor and with Germany as an ideal. There's a deeper reason why Japan wanted to become a European-style colonial power - because it was already on that path before the 250y stasis anyways, almost taking on Imperial China during Sengoku-jidai.</span></p></div></td></tr>

(Needham himself died in the 1990s.) There's a fascinating Wikipedia article on the topic, and if you can find a copy of the completed volumes (many college/university libraries have it), it's a treat.<p>The general question of the how, why, and when of the Industrial Revolution has fascinated historians, technologists, and economists for ages.  Karl Polanyi's <i>The Great Transformation</i>, Gregory Clark's <i>A Farewell to Alms</i>,[1] and numerous other works address this.</p><p>Geographic determinism has become tremendously unpopular among historians, though elements of it carry weight with me.  Of China and Japan vs. Europe and Britain, there are several factors:</p><p>- Political unity vs. disunity, as you note.</p><p>- Crops.  Wheat is suitable to individual, independent farming.  Rice requires community coordination.</p><p>- Hydrology.  The Chinese empire effectively started as a large civil water works management bureaucracy.  Outside Egypt and Rome's aqueducts, there was no similarly-scoped coordination in the West.</p><p>- Watersheds.  Europe's rivers diverge from the interior, China's flow in parallel to relatively proximate mouths.  Political boundaries in Europe have typically conformed reasonably well to watersheds, though allied / opposed alignments have changed with time.  Even today, many county-level jurisdictions correspond to local watersheds.  And in both China and Europe, virtually all heavy transport until modern times was along rivers or canals, if not sea or lakes.</p><p>- While Britain and Japan are both large islands near continental empires, the geology is utterly different:  sedimentary with vast coal deposits, and volcanic with virtually no fossil fuels.  While each island was tremendously politically stable, resistant to invasions, England could fuel growth of iron, glass, and steam industries, Japan could not.  England was generally relatively wealthy, Japan was one of the poorest countries prior to industrialisation.</p><p>- China has long been politically unified (if subject to occasional invasions), Europe has long been politically fractured.  China could shut down innovation and foreign trade.  No such global policies were possible in Europe.</p><p>Within Europe, the distribution of coal is almost wholly in the north:  Wales, England, a tiny patch in northern Spain, some in France, and heavy deposits in Germany and Poland.  Southern Germany is very fuel-poor, excepting petroleum (not very handy in pre-industrial times) in Silesia, Romania, and Baku (Russia).  Coal fueled metalurgy, glassmaking, and eventually steam power in England.</p><p>England's flat terrain and ready access to the sea (no part of Great Britain is more than 60 miles from the coast) made transport of the bulky fuel by ship viable.  Overland transport wasn't an option -- firewood fuel locally gathered was far more attractive.  A similar situation existed in the US where coal didn't overtake wood as a fuel until the 1880s.  Rail transport finally made hauling coal from mountain-based mines in Apallachia possible, but benefited greatly from advances in steelmaking (Bessemer process, 1860s), allowing stronger, less fracture-prone rails, and stronger, more powerful locomotives.  Rail is effectively canals-on-land, the first truly viable overland freight tansport mode.</p><p>There are many other factors, there's tremendous dispute over all of this, and as I've hinted, there's a large literature.  I obviously find the geological argument at least plausible in many regards.  Given the lack of testability, final adjudication of the question is unlikely.</p><p>________________________________</p><p>Notes:</p><p>1.

I was wondering if you and I had read the same post here; turns out we hadn't.<p>The original answer that I read yesterday has since been removed by the mods for some reason.</p><p>---</p><p>[-] ImOuttaThyme66 points 16 hours ago</p><p>[Their number system.](<a href="http://storyofmathematics.com/roman.html" rel="nofollow">http://storyofmathematics.com/roman.html</a>)</p><p>Mathematician in studying here with a side hobby of history. Sources are included throughout.</p><p>You may recall from elementary school or personal perusing of Roman history books that they had their own numeral system with letters instead of their own numerals, excerpts of the Latin Alphabet. I is 1, C is 100, and so on.</p><p>The Romans did decent with their numeral system. They could add, subtract, multiply and divide with their numbers. However, it was missing two very important principles, if that's the right word, that today's Arabic numbers have.</p><p>The first is the idea of zero in mathematics. They knew the concept of nothing yes but they had no numeral for the number "zero." So essentially, try doing your own math homework without using the number zero in the one's place, the ten's place, and so on. Now, zero itself didn't come with Arabic numbers but they did come from an ancestor. [Origins of Zero](<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/origin-number-zero-180953392/" rel="nofollow">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/origin-number-zero-18...</a>)</p><p>Which led to the second problem with Roman numerals. Their numbers do not work on a positional system. Today's Arabic numbers, 0-9 work on a positional system. That is, we have the one's place, go left one digit, ten's place, left again, hundred's place, and so on. Each digit in a number is the base raised to a certain power. And this is what makes addition, subtraction, multiplication and division so easy to do with Arabic numbers, especially with the concept of zero, a placeholder to place in a certain space when a number has no "tens" or "hundreds" or "ones". Like 109. It has 9 ones, and 1 hundred, but no tens. Without zero, we couldn't be able to write it out like this.</p><p>A little sidenote here, technically, the Romans did have a positional system. That is, the greater numerals were on the left and the lesser ones were on the right unless they were using two numerals to communicate numbers. So, it's not an explicit positional system like we do today, in which each digit means a certain number, they did order their numbers around based on size.</p><p>Now, in fairness, the Romans simplified their numeral system a little over the years by adding two principles, subtraction and multiplication. What the Romans did was that whenever they placed a smaller number before a bigger number, those two numbers communicated a new number entirely by subtracting the smaller from the bigger. So for example, 109, CIX, the IX becomes worth 9 because X (10) - I (1) is IX (9).</p><p>Multiplication, to indicate 1000's, they would put a line over the symbol, and that would be the same as multiplying it by a 1000.</p><p>Let's do a little Roman math.</p><p>For Roman numerals, 109 would be written out as CIX. Great, we get the amount communicated. Let's say we want to add 32 to this number in Roman numerals. 32 in Roman is XXXII.</p><p>CIX + XXXII</p><p>Immediately, there's a problem. We have to separate the various numbers. So CIX becomes C IX and XXXII becomes XXX II. Now we can add them together by going "Okay, IX plus I makes X, there's an I remaining, X joins the three other Xs so we now get CXXXXI." aka 141 in today's numbers.</p><p>Let's imagine as if we did that with our numbers. Let's add 109 and 32 again. Only, we're adding 100 and 9 and 30 and 2. We know 9 + 2 makes 10 and 1. We know 10 and 30 makes 40. We have 1 and 100 remaining, there's nothing else to add them together so they stay like that. The resulting number becomes 100 and 40 and 1. Exhausting.</p><p>So, addition is possible. Subtraction is also possible. You have to go through the entire grouping of bases to do it but it is possible. Multiplication is somewhat possible but very iffy, having to do all those grouping of bases manually.</p><p>Division. Division was the hell of the Roman numeral system. The Romans did not have decimals. They had fractions but they did it in duodecimal form, that is, 12ths. They did not have a 1/10th. There was no talking about that explicitly, they preferred to do everything in 12ths. Now, this makes sense, 12 has many factors compared to 10. You can divide 12 by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 itself whereas you can only divide 10 into 1, 2, 5, and 10. There are plenty of people who believe we should move to a duodecimal system. Then again, the French attempted installing a decimal system for time during the French Revolution. Maybe not all ideas are popular.</p><p>Either way, Romans did not have very explicit fractions. They had the base fractions 1/12 through 12/12, then they continued on from there by dividing them further. Like 1/144 (1/12 * 1/12) or 1/8 (3/12 * 6/12). More information on Roman fractions can be found [here](<a href="http://dmaher.org/Publications/romanarithmetic.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://dmaher.org/Publications/romanarithmetic.pdf</a>). Another side fact of their fractions was that they always named them as fractions of something, such as 1/12 of as, which was a currency. Never 1/12 by itself.</p><p>So, now that we've gone through the clusterfuck that is Roman numerology, we can pretty much understand why they didn't advance the mathematics field too much. It was functional for their time. The Romans still did many grand engineering feats that were no doubt developed from this number system. However, when it came to further mathematics such as calculus, which would finally be found by Newton and Leibniz independent of each other in the mid 17th century, you can't get any further when you don't have a positional system that makes adding/subtracting a lot easier, no numeral for the number 0, and your dividing tactics do not allow you to do decimals very well, especially when your numerals are 1, 5, and then powers of 10. Decimals could be made possible with these numerals yes but it would be insanely difficult to understand and is made so much easier when you assign every basic integer, like zero through nine for instance, their own numeral.</p><p>And that's probably why the Romans didn't do very well in mathematical advancement.

I think that's true for many other ancient civilizations as well. It's not true that the Romans didn't understand mathematics, they were spectacular engineers. They just focused on something different.<p>The Romans invented Roman numerals, and it's important to acknowledge that this was a mathematical achievement even though we don't use them as much any more. By putting smaller numbers in front of larger ones, they created a number writing system where you did not have to learn a large number of symbols yet any particular number was short and easy to write. Greek numbers had separate symbols not only for one through nine, but for each of the symbols 10 through 90, which meant you had to learn a lot more symbols for just one through 99.</p><p>It's true that doing calculations with Roman numerals is a pain, especially division, but I don't think the Romans thought this was a big deal. Calculations were typically done using an abacus anyway, so you simply needed a simple way to record results.

But having said that, technological advances of this kind tend to end up as historical footnotes, no matter how amazing they seem at the time.</p><p>I think vaccines and antibiotics are probably our era’s truly great technological advance that kids will still learn about post 26th century. But quantum mechanics and relativity are really our Pythagoras’ theorem equivalents, and will stay in textbooks for a very, very long time.
