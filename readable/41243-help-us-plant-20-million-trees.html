<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">How did #TeamTrees get started?</h6>
<p class="medium">#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the <a href="https://twitter.com/mrbeastyt/status/1131632811008548865?lang=en">internet challenged MrBeast</a> to plant 20 million trees to celebrate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone on YouTube. At his audience&#x2019;s suggestion, MrBeast teamed up with fellow YouTuber Mark Rober, and for 5 months they developed the campaign and organized their influencer friends and colleagues in order to have a fighting chance at achieving their insane goal: 20 million trees by 2020. #TeamTrees launched publicly on October 25th, announcing itself with a wave of #TeamTrees videos, and the rest is up to you. Whether you&#x2019;ve donated to plant one tree, or one million trees, or have simply helped to spread the word, welcome to #TeamTrees!</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">Who exactly is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?</h6>
<p class="medium">We quickly realized that to plant trees in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way we would need to partner with the professionals. After speaking with a number of people in the environmental space, the <a href="https://www.arborday.org/generalinfo/about.cfm">Arbor Day Foundation</a> stood out as being the best. They are one of the largest and longest-running tree planting NGOs, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4157">Charity Navigator rating</a> as the American Red Cross.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?</h6>
<p class="medium">Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org, the YouTube donate button, Arbor Day&#x2019;s #TeamTrees <a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/943641672672793/10157738058298421/">Facebook fundraiser</a>, or the #TeamTrees <a href="https://tiltify.com/arbor-day-foundation/teamtrees">tiltify fundraiser</a> are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">What does my donation actually go towards?</h6>
<p class="medium">For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe. It&apos;s that simple!</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">Is this donation tax-deductible?</h6>
<p class="medium">Since the Arbor Day Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, there&#x2019;s a good chance your monetary donation is tax deductible, but we recommend that you consult your tax professional, who&#x2019;s familiar with your specific tax situation, to be sure. The Foundation&#x2019;s Federal Tax ID number (also known as an EIN, Employer Identification Number) is 23-7169265.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">Are donations in my native currency?</h6>
<p class="medium">All donations to #TeamTrees are processed in United States Dollar (USD).</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">Where are the trees being planted?</h6>
<p class="medium">Due to the sheer volume of trees planted (20 million), they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be public forestlands managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica! <a href="https://www.arborday.org/programs/replanting/international/">Click here</a> to see a list of the Arbor Day Foundation&#x2019;s previous work around the globe.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">Who will plant the trees?</h6>
<p class="medium">The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners such as the U.S. Forest Service, and other government and nongovernmental agencies, to ensure that tree-planting best practices are followed.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">When will the trees be planted?</h6>
<p class="medium">Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. We treat your donation with the greatest respect, so we&#x2019;re working with Arbor Day Foundation to ensure high survivability rates for all the trees planted as part of Team Trees. Sure, you could plant trees faster, but you&#x2019;d be risking the integrity of this vision.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">What species are going to be planted?</h6>
<p class="medium">The Arbor Day Foundation always emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow. Their motto is to plant the right trees, in the right place, at the right time, for the right reasons.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">Why are you planting trees instead of preserving ones that already exist?</h6>
<p class="medium">It is vitally important to protect, manage, <em>and</em> restore forests globally. We are focused on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions.<sup>1</sup> Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation&#x2019;s area of expertise and something they&#x2019;ve been doing for nearly five decades. There&#x2019;s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration. </p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">Can planting trees solve climate change?</h6>
<p class="medium">No, not on its own. Trees are a proven natural climate solution but we need to adhere to the science and attack the problem from many angles at once. #TeamTrees is planting 20 million trees in order to 1) be part of the solution, 2) send a strong signal that this massive community cares about the planet we all call home, and 3) Planting trees is a simple solution that everyone can get behind.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">This is great! How can I get involved with Team Trees?</h6>
<p class="medium">Apart from donating, there are a number of ways to help. The best way to support our goal is to tell other people about it &#x2014; we want everyone to plant trees! Make something creative to spread the word like art, a song, or a video. Don&#x2019;t forget to include a call-to-action (hint&#x2026; plant trees), include #TeamTrees, our deadline (January 1st, 2020), and teamtrees.org.</p>
<p class="medium">Help make this as big as possible. When you see #TeamTrees videos or live streams or social media content out in the world, do all of us a favor and like/upvote/RT/share/comment. Be generous with your attention and help get the message out.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">I&#x2019;m not signing up for junk mail am I?</h6>
<p class="medium">No. And we will never sell your data. Many people are requesting updates on our progress, so we will send those (sparingly) if you tell us you want them when you make your donation.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">How do I make my donation with Apple Pay?</h6>
<p class="medium">Apple Pay payments can only be processed through the Safari browser. To use Apple Pay, open Safari on your desktop or mobile browser and select the Apple Pay logo at the top of the Donate widget.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">Did you send me an email? I don&#x2019;t see it.</h6>
<p class="medium">Try running a search for <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__">[email&#xA0;protected]</a> or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__">[email&#xA0;protected]</a> If you&#x2019;re using Gmail, it&#x2019;s possible our messages are being sorted into the Promotions tab. If that&#x2019;s the case, drag-and-drop a TeamTrees email from the message list over to the Primary tab, or right-click the email and select Move to Tab &gt; Primary. If that doesn&#x2019;t work, or you&#x2019;re not using Gmail, please check your spam filter in case we got mislabeled. Be sure to click &#x2018;Not Spam&#x2019; to help build our reputation.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">How do I get in touch with #TeamTrees?</h6>
<p class="medium">For media inquiries, contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b3c3c1d6c0c0f3c7d6d2dec7c1d6d6c09ddcc1d4"><span class="__cf_email__">[email&#xA0;protected]</span></a>.

<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">Why did I see a large jump in trees all at once?</h6>
<p class="medium">Support for #TeamTrees is being raised through multiple platforms including: teamtrees.org, YouTube, Facebook, Tiltify, arborday.org, and others. We try to update the tree total as soon as possible but there may be sporadic and large increases as donations are aggregated together. TeamTrees.org will always be the most accurate, aggregate tally.</p>
<h6 class="mb-2 semi-bold">Why am I not seeing my inappropriate message?</h6>
<p class="medium">TeamTrees.org is a positive, solution-oriented campaign, and the website is visited by a lot of kids. We reserve the right to remove donation messages that contain links, spam, or otherwise abusive content.</p>
