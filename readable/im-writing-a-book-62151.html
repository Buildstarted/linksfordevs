                        <h2 id="announcing-blazor-in-action">Announcing <em>Blazor In Action</em></h2><p>If you follow me on Twitter then you probably would've already seen the teaser tweet I put out about this a few days ago...</p><figure><twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-0" data-tweet-id="1264161801102639109"></twitter-widget>

</figure><p>But I wanted to write a quick post here as well for those that don't and also to explain in a little more detail what's going on.</p><p>It's going to be called <em><strong>Blazor In Action</strong></em> and will be part of the amazing <em>"In Action"</em> series from <a href="https://www.manning.com/">Manning publishing</a>. I'm not going to lie, I'm feeling quite a bit of imposter syndrome looking at all the great authors who have written books for Manning, <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/c-sharp-in-depth-fourth-edition">Jon Skeet</a> and <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/asp-net-core-in-action-second-edition">Andrew Lock</a> being two prime examples. But I'm determined to do this book justice and I'm working with a great team who are helping me learn the ropes of long form writing.</p><p>The book is going to take about a year to write and publish so this is the start of a long road but one I'm excited to travel (please remind me I said this in a few months! ðŸ˜‚). I'm planning on still publishing blog posts while I'm writing, but as you can imagine, they won't be quite as frequent as they have been in the past. So please bare with me during this time.</p><p>Along the way I'm hoping to get you some sneak peaks of the chapters on here, but Manning also have a great program called MEAP (Manning Early Access Program). This allows you to buy a book while it's being written, you literally get the chapters as I finish writing them â€“ as well as a copy of the finished book. You can also give your feedback along the way and help make the book even better! As soon as MEAP opens for <em>Blazor In Action</em> I'll let you know.</p><p>That's about it for now, I really hope you all like the book when it's done and I'll keep you updated with its progress. </p>
