LYRICS:

At the North Pole, new satellite photos show arctic ice is melting so fast
Oh snap, how fast?
Many scientists now predict it will be gone within 30 years
Surely you jest‚Äì‚ÄìI'm under cardiac arrest, shawtayee
Some researchers think it could disappear in just 6 / SHIT
Without it, there could be a snowball effect (ohhhh)
With temperatures rising even faster
If we all don't take bold action and take it soon
Yeah, we will find ourselves on

Very thin ice (x4, building to harmony)
Tell 'em, Katie, we'll be on very thin ice
The temperatures rise
We have to solve this cri - i - sis
Of very thin ice

At the South Pole an ice shelf the size of Connecticut
Is in danger of melting
Whatcha trying to tell me?
Because the ice bridge that held it in place has shattered
Take back whatcha said‚Äì‚ÄìI'm feeling existential dread, shawtayee!
It's 1 of 10 ice shelves that have shrunk or collapsed / THAT'S BAD
Some were 10,000 years old (so ooooold)
Polar ice is the Earth's air conditioner
If we all don't take bold action, and take it soon
Yeah, we will find ourselves on

Chorus

Now it's 2019...the very thin ice is still liquefying
I agree with 2009 me: we should keep our glaciers nice and icy

At the UN, a new report emphasized just how dire the situation is
Shit, how long we got to live?
Adding rising populations to changes in rainfall and temperatures
I came back in time and the hurricanes done lost they minds, shawtayee
Here's hoping Congress comes together to act boldly (hopefully)
The health of the Earth should not be a political football (truuuuue)
Scientists say we can't afford to punt
If we all don't take bold action, and take it soon
Yeah, we will find ourselves on

Chorus x2

Baby, I'm back, came to the past 10 years from the future
We got gay marriage from the east coast to the left coast‚Äì‚Äìno thanks to you, sir
And we got rid of the pirates; now the ocean's quiet
Put guns on the boats and now no one wants to try shit
Legalized weed in a few states
Other ones laggin but they take
Vacations to the good states
So they can all order postmates
10 years of schmoyoho
And the accent's still on the yo
Put a couple 0s on the sub count
Time to do the end of the video plug now
