            <p>Continuous is always running your code so you can
                see changes to objects as you type. This makes writing
                interactive applications easier than
                with the old Code-Build-Run cycle. You are now
                free to make lots of small changes and see their
                effects immediately.</p>

                <p>Having access to running objects as you code is
                like having an always-on debugger. You can inspect objects,
                create objects, and even call functions.</p>

        <p>Use whichever language you love or 
            whichever is best at the task at hand - no judgement.
            No matter your choice, you will have beautiful semantic highlighting
            and code completion.

        <p>All compiling is
            done right on the device. This keeps your code

            on a flight again.</p>

                <p>Writing scripts is fun, but eventually you need to
                    split your code into multiple files. This is great
                    for code reuse and for keeping your sanity.</p>
                <p>Continuous supports <strong>Application</strong> projects (Console and iOS)
                    and <strong>Library</strong> projects in standard
                    .csproj and .fsproj formats.

        <p>Continuous comes with a variety of examples that
            range from boring forms apps to silly games.
            These are great if you're learning to program
            or just want to see some examples of the amazing
            things you can do on iPads.</p>
