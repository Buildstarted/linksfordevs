						<p>As part of Apple’s commitment to security, this program is designed to help improve security for all iOS&nbsp;users, bring more researchers to iPhone, and improve efficiency for those who already work on iOS&nbsp;security. It features an iPhone dedicated exclusively to security research, with unique code execution and containment&nbsp;policies.</p>

							<h2>How It Works</h2>
							<p>The Security Research Device (SRD) is intended for use in a controlled setting for security research only. Shell access is available, and you’ll be able to run any tools and choose your entitlements. Otherwise, the SRD behaves as closely to a standard iPhone as possible in order to be a representative research target.</p><p>SRDs are provided on a 12-month renewable basis and remain the property of Apple. They are not meant for personal use or daily carry, and must remain on the premises of program participants at all times. Access to and use of SRDs must be limited to people authorized by Apple.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>If you use the SRD to find, test, validate, verify, or confirm a vulnerability, you must promptly report it to Apple and, if the bug is in third-party code, to the appropriate third party. If you didn’t use the SRD for any aspect of your work with a vulnerability, Apple strongly encourages (and rewards, through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/security-bounty/">Apple&nbsp;Security&nbsp;Bounty</a>) that you report the vulnerability, but you are not required to do so.</li>
								<li>If you report a vulnerability affecting Apple products, Apple will provide you with a publication date (usually the date on which Apple releases the update to resolve the issue). Apple will work in good faith to resolve each vulnerability as soon as practical. Until the publication date, you cannot discuss the vulnerability with others.</li>
								<li>Vulnerabilities found with an SRD are automatically considered for reward through the Apple&nbsp;Security&nbsp;Bounty.</li>
