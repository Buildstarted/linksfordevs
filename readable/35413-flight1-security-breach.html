    <h1>Flight1 Security Breach</h1>
    <div class="entry"> <p>According to a message that has appeared on <a href="https://www.avast.com/hackcheck/leaks">Avast Hack Check</a>, it would appear that data from <strong>Flight1</strong> has been stolen as a database was breached. The alleged breach, according to Avast, would have happened on an unconfirmed date and would affect 152 482 accounts. The stolen data would contain e-mail addresses, as well as passwords, and the data would be shared privately on the internet.</p> <div class="wpmf-gallerys"></div>
<p>We have reached out to Flight1 for a statement. They have told us they are looking into the alleged breach, but could not confirm anything has happened at this point in time, though they did express concern with the situation. They could however confirm, that even in the case of a breach, the site does <strong>not</strong> store useful payment information. No full creditcard numbers are stored, nor are any expiration dates or card verification numbers. PayPal data is also not stored by Flight1.</p>
<p>Flight1 also uses advanced one-way hashing methods to secure their passwords, so these should be safe as well in case of a breach. Furthermore, Flight1 wants to emphasise that they follow a &#x2018;<strong>Data-Minimum</strong>&#x2018; principle, so they only require the data necessary to complete a transaction or serve you. No additional data is required. The Flight1 data usage and privacy statement can also be found on <a href="http://www.flight1.com/view.asp?page=tos">their website</a>.</p>
<p>We are sure the Flight1 team will follow up in case they find out anything more about the breach, as this is a legal requirement for some laws such as <strong>GDPR</strong>. Though Flight1 states that most of your data should stay secure (or useless for an attacker), it is never a bad idea to <strong>change your password</strong> just in case, and keep an eye on any suspicious e-mails you may receive. We will keep you up to date with the situation as we find out more.</p>
