  <p>This is a <em>public love letter</em> to <strong>redo</strong> &amp; the joy it brings building
software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember when I first finished <a href="https://amzn.to/3cJLe9T">The Little Schemer</a> and wrote my first <em>semi</em> useful “JSON Diff” program. I was exalted. I was elated. I was ecstatic.</p>

<p>There is something magical when you learn Lisp that is really tough to convey over a blog post or short article. <strong>One must try it, to grok it</strong>.</p>

<p>I have not professionally used Lisp much since however it’s been immensely impactful in the way I think about &amp; construct software.</p>

<p><strong>Redo is this for build systems</strong>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I must have come across several articles about <em>Redo</em> or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Bernstein">djb’s</a> own <a href="https://cr.yp.to/redo.html">cryptic posts</a> on it however I filed it mentally in the same mental folder I put a lot of stuff I come across on Hacker News; “Cool”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20101214">apenwarr’s post</a> announcing his implementing is c.2010 !</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Redo however is <strong>eye opening</strong>. I may not use it professionally, similar to Lisp, but it’s made an impact on how I view build systems going forward.</p>

<p>Many of you reading this post will do what I’ve done previously coming across Redo; however I hope that at least some fraction of you try it. <strong>Take the red pill.</strong></p>

<dl>
  <dt>My goal here is not to explain <em>how</em> to use Redo; I think Apenwarr’s <a href="https://redo.readthedocs.io/">documentation</a> does a great job of walking one through it. Here though are some standout bits of Redo that were amazing:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Redo is a simple set of primitives executed via the shell.</p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p>Redo primitives (build scripts) can be written in <em>any</em> language.</p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p>Redo is <em>tiny</em>!</p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p>Redo can integrate seamlessly in any build system or wrap them.</p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p>Redo supports checksumming of targets, not just <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20181113">mtime</a>.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>I really encourage everyone to read Apenwarr’s original blog post announcing it
<a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20101214">https://apenwarr.ca/log/20101214</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve read this far and are thinking <em>“If Redo is so great, how come it hasn’t taken over?”</em></p>

<p><strong>I’m asking myself the same thing.</strong></p>
