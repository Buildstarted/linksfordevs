<h3>24 Years:</h3>

that we still have customers from 1995.

<h3>TLS/SSL security &amp; privacy enhancements:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=news.altopia.com">The rating for news.altopia.com at Qualys SSL Labs is an A.</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  For SSL, we now require TLS 1.0 or better (up to TLS 1.2).  SSL 3.0 and SSL 2.0 are considered <a href="https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2014/10/15/ssl-3-is-dead-killed-by-the-poodle-attack">insecure</a> and at Altopia we prefer real security over a false sense of security.  As an existing customer, if you need a free month or two to offset the cost of a newsreader upgrade, please email <a href="mailto:support@altopia.com">support@altopia.com</a>.   Insecure port 666 is also offered as an option if you still need to use insecure SSL 3.0.

<h3>Referral Incentives:</h3>
<blockquote>

Attention Customers: When a successfully billed new customer signs up and 
mentions your email address or the message-id of a Usenet post you make 
from Altopia (no spamming!, less than 30 days old), your account will 
receive a free month of service. Multiple free months are possible.
<br>
Also, if you want a unique token to identify your account, so that you can
mention it in a web page / blog entry, please email <a href="mailto:support@altopia.com">support@altopia.com</a>
and we will generate one for you to share.
<br>
More customers == more revenue == more storage capacity and faster
systems.
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h3>TLS/SSL For All:</h3>
<blockquote>
  We support TLS/SSL (up to TLS 1.2) for all accounts.  If your newsreader
  supports NNTP over TLS/SSL, configure your reader to point to port 563 and you
  should be good to go.
</blockquote>
