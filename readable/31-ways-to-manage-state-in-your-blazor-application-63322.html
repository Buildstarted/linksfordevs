<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Blazor is all about components, but let’s face it, one solitary component is of limited use.</p><p>Much like you or I, one component can only achieve so much by itself.</p><p>The real magic happens when you bring components together.</p><p>Entire applications spring into life when you compose several components together to create larger features.</p><p>But, as soon as you have more then one component you need a way to manage the data that flows between them.</p><p>Get this wrong and, what started off as a “simple enough UI” can slowly devolve into a multi-layered, highly coupled mess, where even the smallest change has the potential to unravel everything.</p><p>Thankfully we can just as easily avoid such chaos, if we take a little time to understand the tools Blazor gives us for managing state in our application…</p><p>Let’s take a really simple example, a simple component to display the logged in user’s name…</p><h2 id="option-1-dont-pass-anything-aka-fetch-your-own-data">Option 1: Don’t pass anything (aka fetch your own data!)</h2><p>First up we have the decentralised model…</p><p>Why go to all the effort of passing state around when you can just let each component fetch its own?</p><p><img src="https://jonhilton.net/img/username-component-fetch-own-data.png" alt="“Component fetching its own data from an API”" title="username component makes its own GET call to fetch profile data"></p><p>The <strong>UserName</strong> component makes its own calls to the API, fetches the details for the current user, then renders their name.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="html">@inject HttpClient Http

}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="pros">Pros</h3><ul><li>Straightforward to implement</li><li>Easy to reason about (you can look at the component and quickly establish what it does)</li><li>Plug and play (this component can literally be dropped anywhere in your app and it “just works”)</li></ul><h3 id="cons">Cons</h3><ul><li>Multiple instances == multiple network calls</li><li>This component relies on data being stored/persisted in the backend</li><li>Components know about data persistence/retrieval</li><li>Gets rapidly more complex in non read-only scenarios (persisting data)</li><li>Hard to make components react to state changes, without getting them to periodically re-fetch data for themselves</li></ul><p>Taking this approach assumes your components will be fetching data from a backend API but this raises some questions.</p><p>What if you have state in your application that you don’t want to persist (or want to delay persisting). For example, your user might be filling in a form and you want to keep hold of it until they submit it to the backend.</p><p>The broader issue here is, should components fetch their own data?</p><p>What if you start storing more data “in memory”, or you decide to use local storage instead of API calls?</p><p>If every component fetches its own data these adjustments can quickly spiral into lots of breaking changes required for your existing components.</p><p>In a more complex example you might also end up with several components making the same (or similar) API calls to <code>/Profile</code>. This might be OK, but doesn’t seem very efficient, especially if <code>/Profile</code> is a call which returns large amounts of data…</p><p>Overall, this approach works just fine for small apps, and may be all you need.</p><p>But be aware it’s not right for every job, presents some challenges in a larger app and doesn’t always scale particularly well….</p><h2 id="option-2-pass-state-down-all-the-way-down">Option 2: Pass state down, all the way down</h2><p>Probably the “simplest” and certainly most obvious alternative to each component fetching its own data, is to pass state all the way “down the tree”; each component taking the message and passing it along.</p><p><img src="https://jonhilton.net/img/BlazorWASMByExample/passing-data-via-parameters.png" alt="“pass state down through multiple components”" "="" title="multiple components, each one passing a profile object along to the next via parameters"></p><p>Here Blazor shares some similarity with the approach taken by React.</p><p>In React state flows down, and events bubble back up…</p><p>In this case, <code>NavBar</code> takes on responsibility for fetching profile details, then passes them along to every other component in the chain until they get to <code>UserName</code>.</p><p><strong>NavBar</strong></p><div><pre><code data-lang="csharp">@inject HttpClient Http

It can go anywhere, so long as we can furnish it with an instance of <code>Profile</code>.</p><p>We can therefore minimise the number of network calls to<code>/Profile</code>, potentially only calling it once at the “top” of the component tree, reducing overall network calls and bandwidth.</p><p>However, in any realistically large application we’re likely to spend a significant amount of time navigating up and down the component tree because it’s not obvious (from looking at any individual component) where its data came from.</p><h3 id="mind-the-gap">Mind the gap</h3><p>Say we decide to include the date and time the user last accessed the system in our <code>UserName</code> component.</p><p>We’d have to figure out where the <code>Profile</code> instance used by <code>UserName</code> originates, and make sure we populate it with the correct data in the first place, before we can be sure <code>LastLogin</code> will work.</p><p><img src="https://jonhilton.net/img/BlazorWASMByExample/including-more-data-in-the-profile-object.png" alt="“Adding data to an object passed as a parameter”" title="Multiple components chained together via parameters, explanation of how adding more fields to the profile class requires finding where the profile instance originated"></p><p>The bigger the gap between where we need to show the new data and where we go to populate it, the more work for us to track down the relevant code.</p><p>We also end up adding boilerplate code to all the components in the “middle” of this chain even if they don’t need access to <code>Profile</code> themselves (they still have to accept it and pass it on).</p><p>This problem becomes especially obvious when you need to pass additional parameters down the tree.</p><p>Imagine for example we declared an additional parameter in <code>UserName</code>, say a <code>ShowLastLogin</code> flag to control whether to show the user’s last login date/time.</p><p>We’d have to pass that all the way in from the top, changing lots of components as we go, just to get the correct value down to the bottom of the tree.</p><p><img src="https://jonhilton.net/img/BlazorWASMByExample/add-parameters-to-existing-components.png" alt="“Adding more parameters to existing components”" title="Multiple components taking in two parameters: a Profile and a ShowLastLogin boolean"></p><p>If we’re not careful, we’re going to end up passing a lot of parameters around, updating many components every time we add something new, just to get a value to show up at the bottom of the tree.</p><h2 id="option-3-cascading-values---an-alternative">Option 3: Cascading Values - an alternative</h2><p>Blazor has another option for getting state to a component.</p><p>Take our profile details for example; it’s quite feasible we’d want to access that information from several different components.</p><ul><li>Login Control</li><li>User Avatar</li><li>User Name</li></ul><p>So what should we do? Should we pass the profile down into each one, through as many components as it takes to get there?</p><p>We could, but this has the potential to turn into a maintenance nightmare.</p><p>Instead we can declare a cascading value at the “top” of our application, then access that parameter anywhere we like in the component tree below it.</p><p><img src="https://jonhilton.net/img/BlazorWASMByExample/cascading-values.png" alt="“Accessing a user profile via a cascading parameter”" title="Three components and one of them (Username) directly accesss the profile cascading value instead of taking it in from the parent (Logged in user) component via a regular parameter"></p><p>To make this work, we declare the cascading value…</p><p><strong>NavBar</strong></p><div><pre><code data-lang="html">@inject HttpClient Http

</code></pre></div><p>Here we’ve a standard C# class which exposes a public property for the current state of <code>Profile</code> and a method to update the Profile with different data.</p><p>We can register this as a Singleton (if we’re using Blazor Web Assembly, in program.cs).</p><div><pre><code data-lang="csharp">builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;ProfileService&gt;();

&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;

@code {

    <span>protected</span> <span>override</span> <span>async</span> Task OnInitializedAsync()

        <span>await</span> ProfileService.Set(<span>new</span> Profile { Name = <span>"Jon"</span> });
    }

}
</code></pre></div><p>But there is one teeny tiny flaw in this…</p><p>If we were to call <code>ProfileService.Set()</code> from one component, other components in our app which are bound to the profile won’t automagically re-render to show the updated value…</p><p><img src="https://jonhilton.net/img/BlazorWASMByExample/re-render-components-on-state-change.png" alt="“Re-render components when state changes”" title="An edit profile component which updates the profile service's profile property when the user makes changes.
