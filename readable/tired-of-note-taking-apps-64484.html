<p>I‚Äôm tired of note-taking apps. </p>



<p>It‚Äôs not because of limited choices. But it‚Äôs the other way around. There are so many note-taking apps you could try but end up sticking to none. At least, that‚Äôs my story. It‚Äôs a perfect example of&nbsp;<strong>the paradox of choice.</strong></p>



<p>I used to wonder why people keep building so many ‚Äònote-taking‚Äô apps when the market is already crowded with choices. Then I figured a few reasons why.</p>



<ul><li><strong>the market size</strong>: the global <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/note-making-management-software-market/#:~:text=According%20to%20Verified%20Market%20Research,5.32%25%20from%202019%20to%202026." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">note-taking management software market</a> is estimated to reach&nbsp;<strong>$1.35 billion </strong>by<strong> 2026</strong>, growing at a&nbsp;<strong>CAGR </strong>of<strong> 5.32% </strong>from<strong> 2019 to 2026</strong></li><li><strong>greater scope for innovation:&nbsp;</strong>eg., be it creating a task list, a roadmap, or a design repository, Notion can handle it all</li><li><strong>lack of satisfaction:&nbsp;</strong>it‚Äôs noted that people always use a combination of note-taking apps and hardly stick to one for a long time</li></ul>



<p>Despite such heavy competition, apps like Notion, Google Keep, OneNote, Evernote, etc. have managed to earn a place. People use these apps for</p>



<ul><li>the ecosystem. eg., Google Keep, Microsoft OneNote</li><li>the neat user experience., eg. Bear etc.</li><li>creating a disciplined way of taking notes. eg., Notion, Roam Research</li></ul>



<p>I‚Äôve tried them all. But none of these apps have turned me into a ‚Äò<strong>repeat user</strong>.‚Äô </p>



<p>After battling with so many apps only to feel guilty for not having the discipline to consistently use them, I‚Äôve finally resorted to the most personal and easy alternative ‚Å†‚Äî&nbsp;<strong>writing things down</strong>.</p>



<p>I‚Äôm familiar with writing in a notebook since my childhood. It‚Äôs not new to me, and it absolutely doesn‚Äôt require any learning curve.</p>



<h3>The reasons why I find writing things down useful</h3>



<ul><li>absolute focus and the ability to think through the points I‚Äôm writing</li><li>gives a chance to remember what I‚Äôm writing</li><li>no way to copy-paste stuff as it is, and that means taking notes in a way I understand</li><li>easy to switch between formats eg., flowchart, mind map, Venn diagram, etc</li><li>helps me stay in touch with my handwriting</li></ul>



<p>Of course, everything has its downsides, and writing things down is no exception here. <br>For example, I will not be able to</p>



<ul><li>add screenshots/images, links, etc</li><li>easily search for content as there‚Äôs no ‚Äòsearch bar‚Äô</li></ul>



<p>And maybe there‚Äôs more to the list I‚Äôm not talking about. </p>



<p>All I can say for sure is, based on my usage behavior, I‚Äôm okay missing out on these features. I can always save links to <a href="https://app.getpocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket</a> for future reference, and take pictures of my notes to share with friends.</p>



<p>So if you ask me if I‚Äôd try a beautiful, innovate note-taking app that‚Äôs much better than the apps I‚Äôve used so far, my answer is,&nbsp;<em>‚Äú<strong>Why not</strong>! <strong>I‚Äôd definitely give it a shot</strong></em>.‚Äù</p>



<p>But my greatest worry is if I‚Äôd continue using it.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>If my opinion on note-taking apps changes over time, I‚Äôd be happy to update this post with a ‚ÄúAnd the hero finally arrived!‚Äù heading to talk about the app that helped change my mind. ü§°</p>
