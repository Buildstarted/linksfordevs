<h2>USAGE</h2>
<pre><code>gcc -o prog prog.c
./prog
</code></pre>
<p>Alternates between P1 and P2. Enter a digit [1-9] to move:</p>
<pre><code>1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
</code></pre>
<p>The game ends if:</p>
<ul>
<li>A player completes three in a row; that player wins</li>
<li>All squares are taken; neither player wins</li>
<li>A player makes an illegal move; their opponent wins</li>
</ul>
<h2>WHY?</h2>
<p><a href="http://ioccc.org/" rel="nofollow">IOCCC</a></p>
<h2>OBFUSCATION</h2>
<p>The entirety of the program consists of a single call to printf.</p>
<pre><code>int main() {
    while(*d) printf(fmt, arg);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>fmt</code> is a single string, and <code>arg</code> is a series of arguments to printf.</p>
<p>While its primary purpose is to serve as The One True Debugger, printf also happens
to be Turing complete. (See "Control-Flow Bending: On the Effectiveness of Control-Flow
Integrity" where we introduced this in an actual, published, academic paper. The
things you can get away with sometimes.)</p>
<p>We ab^H^Huse this fact to implement a the logic of tic-tac-toe entirely within
this one printf call (and a call to scanf() to read user input).</p>
<p>Here's (briefly) how it works.</p>
<h3>Preliminaries</h3>
<p>This program uses three printf format specifiers.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>%d</code> takes an integer argument and prints it</li>
<li><code>%s</code> takes a string argument and prints it</li>
<li><code>%n</code> takes a pointer and writes (!!) the number of bytes printed so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, everyone probably knows this. Let's get a bit more advanced.</p>
<p>Format specifiers can take extra "arguments".</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"%hhn"</code>: store the number of bytes written mod 256 to the char pointer</li>
<li><code>"%2$d"</code>: print argument 2 to printf (and not the sequentially next argument)</li>
<li><code>"%8d"</code>: pad the printed integer to 8 characters</li>
<li><code>"%3$.*4$d"</code>: print argument 3 to printf with as many zeros as in argument 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following expression</p>
<pre><code>printf("%1$.*2$d%3$hhn", 5, 10, &amp;x)
</code></pre>
<p>will have the same effect as if we had written</p>
<pre><code>x = 10;
</code></pre>
<p>because it will print out <code>0000000005</code> (5 padded to size 10) and then write the
number of bytes written to x.</p>
<h3>Printf Oriented Programming</h3>
<p>Alright, now we can get to the real fun.</p>
<p>We perform arbitrary computation with printf treating memory as a binary
array---one bit per pair of bytes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The zero bit is represented by the sequence <code>00 00</code></li>
<li>The one-bit is represented by the sequence <code>xx 00</code> where <code>xx</code> is any non-zero byte.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use format strings to compute the OR/NOT of arbitrary "bits".</p>
<p>We'll start with the simplest, OR:</p>
<pre><code>printf("%1$s%2$s%3$hhn", a, b, c)
</code></pre>
<p>will compute</p>
<pre><code>*c = strlen(a) + strlen(b)
</code></pre>
<p>but given that strlen(x) is 1 for a 1-bit and 0 for a 0-bit, we have</p>
<pre><code>*c = a | b
</code></pre>
<p>Computing the NOT of a single value is also easy:</p>
<pre><code>printf("%1$255d%1$s%hhn", a, b)
</code></pre>
<p>will compute</p>
<pre><code>*b = (strlen(a)+255)%256 = strlen(a)-1
</code></pre>
<p>and again, because <code>strlen(x)</code> is either <code>1</code> or <code>0</code> we have</p>
<pre><code>*c = !b
</code></pre>
<p>From here we can compute any binary circuit. Doing something efficient,
though, still takes work.</p>
<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
<p>The game itself is represented as a board of 18 bits, 9 bits per player, along
with a turn counter that alternates between player 1 and player 2.</p>
<p>To detect who has won, we implement the following logic. Let A, B, and C be
pointers to three squares in a row to test, and D be where to save if there is a
win or not.</p>
<pre><code>"%A$s%B$s%C$s%1$253d%11$hhn" // r11 = !(*A &amp; *B &amp; *C)
ZERO
"%11$s%1$255d%11hhn" // r11 = !r11
ZERO
"%11$s%D$s%D$hhn" // *D = *D | r11
</code></pre>
<p>That is, we set <code>*D</code> to <code>1</code> if there is a three-in-a-row. We repeat this for all
possible three-in-a-row configurations, for both players.</p>
<p>The ZERO macro ensures that the number of bytes written out is 0 mod 256 with
the following expression</p>
<pre><code>"%1$hhn%1$s" (repeated 256 times)
</code></pre>
<p>where argument 1 is a pointer to a temporary variable followed by a null byte.</p>
<p>This works because if the current count is 0 mod 256, then "%1$hhn" will write
zero to argument 1 and then "%1$s" will never emit any text. If, on the other
hand, the count is not 0 mod 256, a length-1 string will be written to argument
1, and then "%1$s" will increment the count by one. By repeating this 256
times we're eventually going to reach 0 mod 256.</p>
<p>Checking if there has been an invalid move is achieved similarly.</p>
<p>In order to decide what to print out, we have to cast the "in-memory" array of
bits to Xs and Os to print out. This is actually rather straightforward. Given
in 1$ the pointer to player 1's square, and 2$ the pointer to player 2's, and
in 3$ the pointer to the board string, we can compute</p>
<pre><code>"%1$s" (repeated 47 times) "%2$s" (repeated 56 times) %1$32d%3$hhn"
</code></pre>
<p>which will, in effect, compute</p>
<pre><code>*r3 = (*r1) * 47 + (*r2) * 56 + 32
</code></pre>
<p>which will output ' ' if neither are true, 'X' if r1 is, or 'O' if r2 is.</p>
<h3>Further Obfuscations</h3>
<p>In order to be able to finally display the board, while still only using one
printf statement, we finish the statement with</p>
<pre><code>"
[2J
%26$s"
</code></pre>
<p>which is the escape sequence to clear the screen, and then prints argument 26.
Argument 26 is a pointer to a char* in memory, that initially is undefined,
but within the printf statement we will construct this string to look like a
tic-tac-toe board.</p>
<p>After the board, we need to print one of the following strings:</p>
<pre><code>P1&gt;_
P2&gt;_
P1 WINS
P2 WINS
P1 TIES
P2 TIES
</code></pre>
<p>Depending on if it's P1 or P2's turn to move, the game is over and someone
won, or the game is over and it is a draw.</p>
<p>This turns out not to be as hard as it might look. Using the same trick as
before, we set byte for to be</p>
<pre><code>*byte4 = is_win * 'W' + is_tie * 'T'
</code></pre>
<p>The byte <code>'I'</code> and <code>'S'</code> can always be the same, and we do the same for <code>'E'</code>/<code>'N'</code>.</p>
<p>We do this same on-the-fly creation of the <code>scanf()</code> format string, but for a
different reason. We first want to run <code>printf()</code> to show the first board, and
then alternate between runs to <code>scanf()</code> and <code>printf()</code> reading and then displaying
moves. importantly, we <em>do not</em> want a final scanf when the game ends. It should
just exit.</p>
<p>One option would be to implement the logic as</p>
<pre><code>printf()
while (*ok) {
    scanf();
    printf();
}
</code></pre>
<p>but this would DOUBLE the number of calls to printf we require. So instead we
implement it like this</p>
<pre><code>while (*ok) {
    scanf();
    printf();
}
</code></pre>
<p>(In reality we actually pass <code>scanf()</code> as an argument to avoid the extra
statement, but it has the same effect.)</p>
<p>Notice there is now no initial <code>printf()</code>. In order make sure the program doesn't
block before the first <code>printf()</code>, but we initialize the <code>scanf()</code> format to the null
string so that it returns right away without blocking. The first time the <code>printf()</code>
call runs, it writes out <code>"%hhd"</code> to create the create the <code>scanf()</code> format string.</p>
