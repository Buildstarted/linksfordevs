                        <p>I got tagged in a thread on Twitter last week by <a href="https://twitter.com/RockyLhotka">Mr Rockford Lhotka</a>. I've embedded the thread below so you can read it for yourself, but essentially he was voicing his frustration at losing data when an error/timeout/server error/etc occur in web applications. </p><figure><twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-0" data-tweet-id="1255347828852953089"></twitter-widget>

</figure><p>Now, this type of situation very much depends on the application and how it's been developed, but, none the less, I agree. There is nothing worse than spending ages filling in a form and then for something to blow up and lose everything you've entered.</p><p>He and <a href="https://twitter.com/DanWahlin">Dan Wahlin</a> were discussing the idea of a form auto saving data so it could be recovered if something went wrong with the application. I got tagged by Rockford suggesting it would be a great addition to <a href="https://github.com/Blazored">Blazored</a> â€“ Challenge accepted! ðŸ˜ƒ</p><figure><twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-1" data-tweet-id="1255360086974873606"></twitter-widget>

</figure><p>In this post, I'm going to show you a solution I've come up with for auto saving and rehydrating form data in Blazor. I'm going to start by outlining the goals and boundaries I set for this project. Then I'm going to tell you about some options I decided not to go with and why I didn't pursue them. Then I'll get into the meat of things and step through the solution I developed. I'll show how I satisfied each goal set out at the start. Then I'll finish by showing you how using the solution compares to the existing <code>EditForm</code> experience.</p><p>I want to be clear this is by no means a bullet proof, cover all bases solution. It's more an MVP to be built on. I'm hoping to release this as a new package under Blazored after a bit more development and refinement. If you want to help out with that then I've included a link to the new repo at the <a href="#blazored-autosaveeditform">end of the post</a>.</p><h2 id="defining-the-goals">Defining the Goals</h2><p>To give myself some focus and boundaries I made a list of four things that needed to be achieved in order for this to be considered useful.</p><ol><li>Save data to local storage when it's entered into each form controls</li><li>Rehydrate data from local storage when the user returns to the page</li><li>Clear saved data from local storage when it's successfully submitted by the form</li><li>Try to keep things as close to the current experience with <code>EditForm</code> as possible for developers</li></ol><p>There were also some things that I wanted to rule out for now.</p><ul><li>Only persist to local storage</li><li>Don't worry about complex forms with nested complex objects</li></ul><p>Now I had a defined scope for the work, I could start playing around with some ideas and see what I could come up with.</p><h2 id="the-cutting-room-floor">The Cutting Room Floor</h2><p>As you would expect, I went though many failed ideas before I settled on a solution I was happy with. I thought it might be interesting to briefly highlight what they were and why I didn't pursue them.</p><h3 id="first-attempt">First attempt</h3><p>I started with the idea of creating a new component which could be nested inside an <code>EditForm</code>, similar to the <code>DataAnnotationValidator</code>. I quickly got something in-place which used the cascaded <code>EditContext</code>, provided by <code>EditForm</code>, to hook into the <code>OnFieldChanged</code> event. From here I could intercept model updates and persist the model to local storage. </p><p>The problem came when trying to rehydrate the form. Due to where my component sat in the component tree, the UI wasn't updating to show the values in the textboxes. I needed a <code>StateHasChanged</code> call higher in the tree and I just couldn't get that to work in a nice way.</p><p>I also would need to know when the form had been submitted so I could achieve number 3 on my goals list, clearing the saved values on a successful form post. There was no way I could reliably do that using the <code>EditContext</code> alone.</p><h3 id="second-attempt">Second attempt</h3><p>After some hacking about I came to the conclusion that the best option was going to be a new form component, replacing <code>EditForm</code>. I wanted to save duplicating all of the code from <code>EditForm</code> and just inherit from it. I could then add some additional functionality to save and load the form values.</p><p>Unfortunately, that was a short lived hope. I needed access to some members which were private. I got round that with some reflection foo, but the show stopper was needing to add some additional logic in the <code>HandleSubmitAsync</code> method, there was no way to hack this.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>In the end, I concluded that I would need to duplicate the <code>EditForm</code> component and use it as a starting point for my new form component. It wasn't the end of the world, after my experimenting I was happy with the fact I had to change the behaviour of the original component enough that just extending it wasn't going to work.</p><p>With this decision made I then moved on to what became the solution I ended up with.</p><h2 id="building-the-autosaveeditform-component">Building the AutoSaveEditForm Component</h2><p>The starting point for the new component was the existing <code>EditForm</code> component produced by the Blazor team. If you want to see this in its unaltered state you can find it <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/src/Components/Web/src/Forms/EditForm.cs">here</a>. Let's go through each of the changes I made and why.</p><h3 id="integrating-with-local-storage">Integrating with Local Storage</h3><p>The first thing I did was to add the functionality to persist and retrieve the form to and from local storage. This required injecting <code>IJSRuntime</code> into the component and then adding the following two methods.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code><span><span>private</span> <span>async</span> <span>void</span> <span>SaveToLocalStorage</span>(<span><span>object</span> sender, FieldChangedEventArgs args</span>)</span>
{
    <span>var</span> model = Model ?? _fixedEditContext.Model;
    <span>var</span> serializedData = JsonSerializer.Serialize(model);
    <span>await</span> _jsRuntime.InvokeVoidAsync(<span>"localStorage.setItem"</span>, Id, serializedData);
}

<span><span>private</span> <span>async</span> Task&lt;<span>object</span>&gt; <span>LoadFromLocalStorage</span>(<span></span>)</span>
{
    <span>var</span> serialisedData = <span>await</span> _jsRuntime.InvokeAsync&lt;<span>string</span>&gt;(<span>"localStorage.getItem"</span>, Id);
    <span>if</span> (serialisedData == <span>null</span>) <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
    <span>var</span> modelType = EditContext?.Model.GetType() ?? Model.GetType();

    <span>return</span> JsonSerializer.Deserialize(serialisedData, modelType);
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Both of these methods do exactly what they say on the tin. <code>SaveToLocalStorage</code> persists the current form model and <code>LoadFromLocalStorage</code> retrieves the form model.</p><p>In order to identify a particular form, I added an <code>Id</code> parameter to the component which you can see used in the code above. It's worth pointing out that this is definitely something which will need to be improved before the component could be used in a real app â€“ this method won't be enough to guarantee uniqueness across an application.</p><h3 id="hooking-into-field-changes">Hooking into Field Changes</h3><p>With the local storage interfaces in place I moved on to saving the form when fields were updated. This required making some changes to the existing <code>OnParametersSet</code> method. There's an <code>if</code> statement at the end of the original method which looks like this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code><span>if</span> (_fixedEditContext == <span>null</span> || EditContext != <span>null</span> || Model != _fixedEditContext.Model)
{
    _fixedEditContext = EditContext ?? <span>new</span> EditContext(Model);
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I updated it to this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code><span>if</span> (_fixedEditContext == <span>null</span> || EditContext != <span>null</span> || Model != _fixedEditContext.Model)
{
    _fixedEditContext = EditContext ?? <span>new</span> EditContext(Model);
    _fixedEditContext.OnFieldChanged += SaveToLocalStorage;
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I added an extra line which registers a handler for the <code>EditContext</code>s <code>OnFieldChanged</code> event. Now, whenever a field on the form model is updated the <code>SaveToLocalStorage</code> method will be called and the form will be persisted to local storage.</p><p>With the above changes I'd satisfied number 1 on my goals list:</p><ol><li><s>Save data to local storage when it's entered into each form controls</s></li><li>Rehydrate data from local storage when the user returns to the page</li><li>Clear saved data from local storage when it's successfully submitted by the form</li><li>Try to keep things as close to the current experience with <code>EditForm</code> as possible for developers</li></ol><h3 id="rehydrating-the-form-model">Rehydrating the Form Model</h3><p>I played around with a lot of ideas for this and ended up settling on the use of reflection. This was because I needed to update the specific instance of the model passed in, anything else I tried ultimately ended up overwriting that instance with a new one.</p><p>I came up with the following method which is used to copy the values from the form model retrieved from local storage, to the active form model.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code><span><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Copy</span>(<span><span>object</span> savedFormModel, <span>object</span> currentFormModel</span>)</span>
{
    <span>var</span> savedFormModelProperties = savedFormModel.GetType().GetProperties();
    <span>var</span> currentFormModelProperties = currentFormModel.GetType().GetProperties();

    <span>foreach</span> (<span>var</span> savedFormModelProperty <span>in</span> savedFormModelProperties)
    {
        <span>foreach</span> (<span>var</span> currentFormModelProperty <span>in</span> currentFormModelProperties)
        {
            <span>if</span> (savedFormModelProperty.Name == currentFormModelProperty.Name &amp;&amp; savedFormModelProperty.PropertyType == currentFormModelProperty.PropertyType)
            {
                <span>var</span> childValue = currentFormModelProperty.GetValue(currentFormModel);
                <span>var</span> parentValue = savedFormModelProperty.GetValue(savedFormModel);

                <span>if</span> (childValue == <span>null</span> &amp;&amp; parentValue == <span>null</span>) <span>continue</span>;

                currentFormModelProperty.SetValue(currentFormModel, parentValue);
                
                <span>var</span> fieldIdentifier = <span>new</span> FieldIdentifier(currentFormModel, currentFormModelProperty.Name);
                _fixedEditContext.NotifyFieldChanged(fieldIdentifier);
                
                <span>break</span>;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In a nutshell, this code is looping over each property on the saved form model and then finding that same property on the current form model and transferring the value. </p><p>A key thing to note is the call to <code>_fixedEditContext.NotifyFieldChanged(fieldIdentifier);</code>. This lets the current edit context know that the value has been updated and triggers all the right events, a key one being any validation for that field.</p><p>With that method in placed I overrode the <code>OnAfterRender</code> lifecycle method and added the following code.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code><span><span>protected</span> <span>override</span> <span>async</span> Task <span>OnAfterRenderAsync</span>(<span><span>bool</span> firstRender</span>)</span>

    {
        <span>var</span> savedModel = <span>await</span> LoadFromLocalStorage();

        <span>if</span> (Model <span>is</span> <span>object</span> &amp;&amp; savedModel <span>is</span> <span>object</span>)
        {
            Copy(savedModel, Model);

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>When the component first renders, this code will check local storage for an existing saved form model.

If I wanted to honour number 4 on my goals list, keep things close to the current developer experience, I wanted to allow developers to still use the same form events <code>OnSubmit</code>, <code>OnValidSubmit</code> and <code>OnInvalidSubmit</code>.</p><p>The original method which handles the submit events is called <code>HandleSubmitAsync</code> and looks like this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code><span><span>private</span> <span>async</span> Task <span>HandleSubmitAsync</span>(<span></span>)</span>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Keeping <code>OnInvalidSubmit</code> doesn't require any action in terms of the saved form model.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The headache came when trying to keep the <code>OnSubmit</code> event. This event requires the developer to handle the validation of the form manually and then submit it. With the existing design, there is no way for me to know if the form had been submitted and that the saved form model could be removed.</p><p>After some back and fourth I came up with the following design which does require some extra steps from the consumer but I think is worth the trade off. </p><p>The original <code>OnSubmit</code> event is typed as an <code>EventCallback&lt;EditContext&gt;</code> as follows.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>[<span>Parameter</span>] <span>public</span> EventCallback&lt;EditContext&gt; OnSubmit { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }
