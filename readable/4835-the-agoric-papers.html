Miller and K. Eric Drexler appeared in
		<b><i>The Ecology of Computation</i></b>, Bernardo Huberman (ed.) Elsevier
		Science Publishers/North-Holland, 1988. </p><br><hr><br><h3>Markets and Computation: Agoric Open Systems</h3><p>Like all systems involving goals, resources, and actions, computation
		can be viewed in economic terms. This paper examines markets as a model for
		computation and proposes a framework--agoric systems--for applying the power of
		market mechanisms to the software domain. It then explores the consequences of
		this model and outlines initial market strategies.</p><br><hr><br><h3>Incentive Engineering: for Computational Resource Management</h3><p>Agoric computation will require market-compatible mechanisms for the
		allocation of processor time and storage space. Recasting processor scheduling
		as an auction process yields a flexible priority system. Recasting storage
		management as a system of decentralized market negotiations yields a
		distributed garbage collection algorithm able to collect unreferenced loops
		that cross trust boundaries. Algorithms that manage processor time and storage
		in ways that enable both conventional computation and market-based decision
		making will be useful in establishing agoric systems: they lie at the boundary
		between design and evolution. Algorithms are described in detail.</p><br><hr><br><h3>Comparative Ecology: A Computational Perspective</h3><p>A long-standing dream in the field of artificial intelligence has been
		to use evolutionary processes to produce systems of greater competence than
		those we can directly design. This paper compares different evolutionary
		models--such as biological ecosystems, markets, and EURISKO--with respect to
		this goal. This comparison suggests that a form of ecosystem here termed a
		direct market (as opposed to the indirect market of human society) is a
		promising basis for computational ecosystems.</p><br><hr><br></div></div></div></div>
