            <div>
				<p>App developers of all kinds want to build apps quickly — at any scale. To make building apps faster and more flexible, Microsoft is announcing offers and features for Azure Cosmos DB, its fast NoSQL database with open APIs for any scale. These additions are designed to provide customers with pricing models to fit their unique needs, shorten the app development cycle and effectively manage their workloads.</p>
<p>Developers building apps that manage smaller numbers of users need to manage intermittent traffic patterns and “bursty” workloads in a cost-effective way. To address these unique needs, Microsoft has designed Azure Cosmos DB serverless, a more cost-effective way to use Azure Cosmos DB.</p>
<p>This new model offers per-operation compute pricing ideal for noncritical, intermittent and small workloads with moderate performance requirements. Consumption-based pricing bills customers for the total resources (request units) used for each discrete database operation.</p>
<p>Customers must create an Azure Cosmos DB account within the Azure portal and select “serverless” as their pricing model. All resources within this account will run in serverless mode and get billed based on actual consumption of resources to deliver each database request.</p>

				1.2.2.1. Microsoft Azure introduces new PostgreSQL and MySQL capabilities, reasserting commitment to community            </h3>
            <div>
				<p>Microsoft’s Azure cloud service includes a portfolio of secure, enterprise-grade, fully managed database services that support open source database engines.</p>
<p>Microsoft is announcing new product capabilities for these two database offerings — Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Azure Database for MySQL — which are designed to support businesses of all shapes and sizes and to address specific needs of developers on PostgreSQL and MySQL open source databases.</p>
<p>New capabilities launched on Azure Database for PostgreSQL only:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical decoding with wal2json (now in preview)</li>
<li>Online migration to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Hyperscale using Azure Database Migration Service (now generally available)</li>
</ul>
<p>New capabilities launched on both Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Azure Database for MySQL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure Active Directory Authentication (now generally available)</li>
<li>Private Link (now generally available)</li>
<li>3-year Reserved Instances Pricing (now generally available)</li>
<li>Data encryption at rest with Customer Managed Keys – BYOK (preview in June)</li>
</ul>
<p>These new product capabilities will help developers across various types and sizes of workloads to productively leverage enterprise-grade security for their mission-critical work and effectively manage the costs of running their databases on PostgreSQL and MySQL.</p>
<p>In addition to these investments, Microsoft is announcing its contributions to PostgreSQL at Build. Microsoft Azure’s enduring commitment to PostgreSQL is reflected in two recent technical contributions to the community:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increasing scalability and reducing OOM occurrences with disk-based hash aggregation</strong><strong>:</strong> Exceeding the amount of memory available for certain operations results in out-of-memory (OOM) conditions in PostgreSQL. This patch introduces a disk-based approach for hash aggregation, which prevents these OOM occurrences while also enabling processing of more data-intensive queries.</li>
<li><strong>Improving the performance and features of PostgreSQL</strong><strong>:</strong> Implementing support for collation versions for Windows and faster evaluation of expressions, as well as making further progress toward better connection scaling and faster crash recovery for future releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two community contributions to PostgreSQL have been officially submitted and accepted for PG13 as part of the most recent PostgreSQL Commit Fest.</p>
<p>For more information on the product capabilities launched, details will be made available in the product documentation:</p>

				1.3.2. Bot Framework and Azure Bot Service updates enable greater intelligence and data control            </h3>
            <div>
				<p>Microsoft is announcing several improvements across Microsoft Bot Framework and Azure Bot Service to make bot developers more productive.</p>
<p>Azure Bot Service enables customers to build intelligent, enterprise-grade bots while maintaining ownership and control of their data. Microsoft Bot Framework allows developers to build custom bots, which can then be used as integrated components. Updates to these services are:</p>
<p><strong>Bot Framework: </strong>Bot Framework makes developers more productive in building rich conversational AI experiences.</p>
<p>Microsoft is making <a href="https://aka.ms/AA8e9ev"><strong>adaptive dialog capability</strong></a> generally available, so developers can more easily build bots capable of switching contexts within a conversation. For example, a customer booking an airline flight online might ask the bot for a weather forecast for the destination city.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bot Framework SDK &amp;</strong> <strong>Teams integration:</strong> The Bot Framework SDK has been updated to allow developers to build bots from one common SDK that makes the most of Microsoft Teams. For example, the Bot Framework SDK simplifies enabling Single Sign On so HR bots can help provide user-specific information like vacation days and other scenarios that typically require user authentication. Furthermore, the Bot Framework SDK enables developers to build bots capable of proactively sending messages. For example, bots can alert employees to complete required training or take other outstanding actions.</li>
<li><strong>Bot Framework Composer: </strong>Now generally available, this open source tool provides developers with a central environment to get started with bot building quickly, allowing them to focus more on dialog management and less on the scaffolding to begin bot development. This incorporates some of the common components required to build bots such as Language Understanding service and QnA Maker.</li>
<li><strong>Bot Framework Skills: </strong>Bot Framework enables developers to build bots that can reuse other bots as skills within an organization. This helps organizations manage the proliferation of bots, and also allows developers to collaborate in bot development. Now, organizations that use Power Virtual Agents to build no-code bots can use this capability to extend their Power Virtual Agents, which means anyone in the organization can build and collaborate on bot development efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Bot Service (human hand-off): </strong>Bots can power organizations to scale their customer engagement. However, in some scenarios, a bot cannot serve the customer, or the customer chooses to speak to a human agent. To enable this scenario, bot developers previously had to build integrations to popular channels themselves. Microsoft has added new capabilities to simplify development of bots that combine AI and human agents with integration with popular customer service platforms like LivePerson and Microsoft Omnichannel for Customer Service.</li>

				1.3.3. Azure Cognitive Services features enhance AI functionality, deployment, and language capabilities in apps            </h3>
            <div>
				<p>Azure Cognitive Services brings AI within reach of every developer — without requiring machine-learning expertise.</p>
<p>Microsoft is announcing several new features and improvements across Azure Cognitive Services to enable developers to incorporate AI capabilities into their applications. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personalizer apprentice mode: </strong>Personalizer’s new apprentice mode feature enables businesses to skip the learning curve when deploying the service. When switched on, the Personalizer API learns in real time alongside existing solutions without being exposed to users until it delivers performance results according to desired KPI goals.</li>
<li><strong>Speech service enhancements: </strong>The Speech service&nbsp;continues to extend its capabilities to more languages. Speech to Text is expanding&nbsp;to 27 new locales, and speech transcription accuracy is significantly improving with a 30% word error rate reduction. Neural Text to Speech is extending support to&nbsp;11 new&nbsp;locales with&nbsp;15 new&nbsp;voices, with pronunciation error rate reduced by 50% for 13 locales. Additional new capabilities, such as pronunciation assessment, are making it easier for customers to embed advanced speech capabilities into their solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Containers: </strong>With containers, customers can deploy Cognitive Services anywhere from the cloud to the edge. Language Understanding and Text Analytics sentiment analysis 3.0 are now generally available in containers.</li>
<li><strong>Language Understanding: </strong>The Language Understanding service has revamped the labeling experience, making it easier to build apps and bots that can understand the complex language structures people tend to use. Think about the following order: “I want a large chicken pizza without sauce and a medium pizza with olives.” The user has used two different language structures within the same order. This new portal makes it easier to break apart complex requests into related parts.</li>
<li><strong>QnA Maker:</strong> QnA maker is a service that intelligently parses existing content such as FAQ pages or other document types into Q&amp;A pairs. The service produces a “knowledge base,” which is a set of questions and answers. Inevitably, multiple users will want to edit and curate the knowledge base. With Role-based Access Control (RBAC), users can now collaborate on knowledge bases, making it even easier to collaborate on rapid bot development. Additionally, QnA Maker is now giving more control to content managers, enabling them to use a rich text editor to control the formatting of responses to users.</li>

				<p>Visual Studio Live Share, which allows developers to collaborate by co-editing and debugging in real time, now supports text and voice chat, as well as sharing running apps. These new public preview features enable developers to collaborate more effectively without the need for secondary apps for chat or screen sharing.</p>
<p>Visual Studio Live Share allows developers to retain their personal editor preferences and their own cursor, which enables them to transition between following one another and exploring on their own. The ability to work both together and independently provides a collaboration experience that feels more like in-person collaboration.</p>

            <div>
				<p>GitHub, also part of the Microsoft family, recently held a satellite event that included a number of core announcements. This included two new features, code scanning and secret scanning, free for public repos and available in beta as part of GitHub Advanced Security.</p>
<p>Collaborating in software communities requires tools to help consume and produce code safely and to keep all parties secure from mistakes. Code scanning searches for new potential security vulnerabilities with results displayed directly in a pull request, and uses GitHub’s static analysis engine, CodeQL.</p>
<p>Secret scanning (formerly named token scanning) has been available for public repositories since 2018, and is now available for private repositories. Secret scanning is designed to prevent unauthorized access to cloud service accounts through authentication credentials, including Azure secrets within source code. Secret scanning watches private repositories for known secret formats and immediately notifies developers when secrets are found.</p>

<p>Software communities don’t just write code together. They brainstorm feature ideas, help new users get their bearings and collaborate on best ways to use the software. Until now, GitHub only offered issues and pull requests as places to have these conversations. But issues and pull requests both have a linear format — well suited for merging code, but not for creating a community knowledge base. Conversations need their own place—that’s what GitHub Discussions is for. It’s a new way for software communities to collaborate outside the codebase.</p>

Unlocking developer productivity will increase business performance, in what the industry has identified as “Developer Velocity.” A recent <a href="https://aka.ms/AA8e241">McKinsey research report</a> shows that organizations that recognize this can grow revenues 4 to 5 times faster than their competitors.</p>
<p>At Build, Microsoft is releasing a new Developer Velocity Assessment tool to enable customers to measure their Developer Velocity Index (DVI) score and discover where their organization is on the Developer Velocity Maturity scale and benchmark relative to peers by industry. The tool provides targeted and actionable areas to help an organization improve on Developer Velocity.</p>

            <div>
				<p>New Teams extensions in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code enable developers to build Teams apps within tools they are already familiar with. These extensions also enable developers to publish apps directly to AppSource or to their organization’s app catalog. For low code or no code app developers, Power Apps Studio integration with Teams provides similar benefits.</p>
<p>Once an app is published, IT admins will have new app management capabilities in the Teams admin center, including the ability to purchase licenses for applications directly within the admin center. They also can validate and approve line-of-business applications and pre-install ISV or line-of-business apps for their users.</p>
<p>Developers can keep users engaged through two key platform enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single sign-on will enable users to authenticate in one click for the apps they use in Teams.</li>
<li>The Teams Activity Feed API gives developers a new and simpler way to send app notifications to users across their devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>And Teams users now have new ways to engage with apps. Improvements to app search and tailored app suggestions help surface the most relevant apps to users in the Teams store. With new team templates, IT admins will be able to customize templates, such as including certain apps within channels inside a team template. This builds upon the ability for IT admins and end users to pin apps to the application bar. Later this year, users will have the ability to open apps in a separate window for easy access.</p>
<p>Taken together, these improvements will streamline the development of Teams apps and enable deeper user engagement.</p>

<p>With the Bookings app in Teams, organizations can manage multiple departments and staff in a single scheduling experience and can easily schedule virtual appointments with internal and external attendees. This includes healthcare virtual visits, job candidate interviews, financial consults, customer service appointments in retail and student office hours.</p>
<p>In healthcare alone, there were 34 million Teams meetings in the past month, including virtual visits. Healthcare providers including St. Luke’s University Health Network, Stony Brook Medicine, Confluent Health and Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust are using Teams for video conferencing, enabling clinicians to provide personalized consultations and to help protect themselves and their patients. Teams supports HIPAA compliance and is HITRUST certified.</p>
<p>In addition, with the Microsoft Graph API, organizations can incorporate virtual visits into their unique workflows. The API supports the integration of both scheduling and meeting-join links into existing applications such as electronic health records systems in healthcare.</p>

				<p>At Build, Microsoft is announcing that the Fluid Framework will be made open source, allowing developers and creators to use key infrastructure from Fluid Framework in their own applications. Coupled with the release of additional developer documentation and tooling, this provides a new opportunity for developers to work alongside Microsoft to create and evolve Fluid Framework as it is developed.</p>
<p>Microsoft is open sourcing the Fluid Framework, which will be hosted as a repository available on GitHub in the month following Build.</p>
<p>This is an open invitation for developers to join Microsoft on this journey, provide feedback and help shape future capabilities. It will be available to the public and open for any developer to provide feedback, issues and pull requests.</p>
<p>Developers can take advantage of JavaScript APIs that give them access to highly collaborative, shared data structures which can be used to power collaborative experiences. They also can create Fluid components — elements that can be reused within Microsoft 365 and across applications.</p>
<p>More capabilities will be added over time through this Fluid Framework repository.</p>

				<p>Azure Security Center is a unified infrastructure security management system for both Azure and hybrid cloud resources on-premises or in other clouds. At the annual Build conference for developers, May 19-21, 2020, Microsoft is announcing two updates to Azure Security Center.</p>
<ol>
<li>Azure Secure Score API is now generally available to customers. Secure Score is a central component of Azure Security Center’s security posture management. The enhanced Secure Score in preview gives customers a more understandable and effective way to assess risk on their environment and prioritize actions to reduce it. It also simplifies findings by grouping recommendations into a set of Security Controls, each representing an attack surface and scored accordingly.</li>
<li>Suppression rules for Azure Security Center alerts are now publicly available. Use suppression rules to reduce alerts fatigue and focus on the most relevant threats by hiding alerts known to be safe or related to normal activities in your organization. Suppressed alerts will be hidden in Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel but still be available in ”dismissed” state.</li>

<p>In addition,&nbsp;Microsoft Bing for Commerce is releasing version 1 of&nbsp;its&nbsp;software development kit (SDK)&nbsp;so that developers&nbsp;can&nbsp;implement&nbsp;Microsoft Bing for&nbsp;Commerce&nbsp;in&nbsp;the programming language of their choice, including&nbsp;Java, C#&nbsp;and&nbsp;Python.</p>

				5.1.4. Microsoft Edge introduces contextual search and enhancements for developers and commercial customers            </h3>
            <div>
				<p>Microsoft Edge is introducing a series of new features to improve workflows for consumers, developers and commercial customers.</p>
<p>First up is a faster, more contextual way to search from the sidebar. Simply highlight a word or phrase, right click and select “search in sidebar” from the context menu. The results will show up in a pane on the right side of the browser window, so the user does not lose the context of the original content. Commercial customers signed in with an AAD account also can see results from their company intranet. This feature will show up in preview builds in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Developers and commercial customers also will see improvements and enhancements to Microsoft Edge, some available in preview during Build. The changes for commercial customers include: the ability to sync on-premises as commercial customers transition to the cloud; a new feature called Automatic Profile Switching, which prompts users to switch to their work profile if they try to open a link requiring work credentials from their personal profile; and Windows Information Protection, which helps protect content in a web environment where users often share and distribute content.</p>
<p>For developers, Microsoft has made contributions to the Chromium project, including accessibility, inking, scrolling and localization improvements.&nbsp;Webview&nbsp;2.0 previews also are available for .NET and UWP development. And new&nbsp;Progressive Web App (PWA) enhancements&nbsp;in preview&nbsp;make PWAs feel more like native apps, with a more natural user experience for sharing, notifications and more. ​</p>
