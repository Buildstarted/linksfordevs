    <div id="body"> <p>Remote access, collaboration and password manager provider LogMeIn has been sold to a private equity outfit for $4.3bn.</p> <p>A consortium led by private equity firm Francisco Partners (along with Evergreen, the PE arm of tech activist investor Elliott Management), will pay $86.05 in cash for each LogMeIn share &#x2013; a 25 per cent premium on prices before talk about the takeover surfaced in September.</p> <p>LogMeIn&apos;s board of directors is in favour of the buy. Chief executive Bill Wagner said the deal recognised the value of the firm and would provide for: &quot;both our core and growth assets&quot;.</p> <p>The sale should close in mid-2020, subject to the usual shareholder and regulatory hurdles. Logmein also has 45 days to look at alternative offers.</p> <p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1420302/000156459019003676/logm-10k_20181231.htm">In 2018</a> LogMeIn made revenues of $1.2bn and profits of $446m.</p> <p>The company runs a bunch of subsidiaries which offer collaboration software and web meetings products, virtual telephony services, remote technical support, and customer service bots as well as several identity and password manager products.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/09/logmein_gobbles_lastpass/">Logmein bought LastPass</a>, which now claims 18.6 million users, for $110m in 2015. That purchase raised concerns about exactly how LastPass&apos;s new owner would exploit the user data it held, and today&apos;s news is unlikely to allay any of those fears.</p> <p>The next year, LogMeIn merged with <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/26/citrix_logmein_goto/">Citrix&apos;s GoTo business</a>, a <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/17/citrix_layoff/">year after its spinoff</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="https://investor.logmeininc.com/about-us/investors/news/press-release-details/2019/LogMeIn-Enters-into-Definitive-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-Affiliates-of-Francisco-Partners-and-Evergreen-Coast-Capital-for-8605-per-Share-in-Cash/default.aspx">official statement is here</a>. &#xAE;</p> <p class="wptl btm"> <span>Sponsored: </span> <a href="https://go.theregister.co.uk/tl/1889/-8120/detecting-cyber-attacks-as-a-small-to-medium-business?td=wptl1889">Detecting cyber attacks as a small to medium business</a> </p> </div>
