<p>have you heard of <strong>sPAKE</strong> (or <strong>bPAKE</strong>)?</p>
<p>a sPAKE is first and foremost a <strong>PAKE</strong>, which stands for <strong>Password-Authenticated Key Exchange</strong>.
This simply means that authentication in the key exchange is provided via the knowledge of a password.
The s (resp. b) in front means symmetric (resp. balanced). This indicates that both sides know the password.</p>
<p><img alt="Alice and Bob trying to use a sPAKE to authenticate a key exchange" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2020-02-09_at_5.21_.17_PM_.png"></p>
<p>Other PAKEs where only one side knows the password exist, these are called aPAKE for asymmetric (or augmented) PAKEs.
Yes I know the nomenclature is a bit confusing :)</p>
<p>The most promising sPAKE scheme currently seems to be <strong>SPAKE2</strong>, which is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-spake2-09">in the process of being standardized here</a>.
There are other sPAKEs, like Dragonfly which is used in WPA3, but they don't seem to provide as strong properties as SPAKE2.</p>
<p>The trick to a symmetric PAKE is to use the password to blind the key exchange's ephemeral keypairs.</p>
<p><img alt="The first part of a sPAKE with SPAKE2" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2020-02-09_at_5.22_.49_PM_.png"></p>
<p>Note that we can't use the password as is, instead we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass the password into a memory-hard hash function like Argon2 to obtain <code>w</code>. Can you guess why we do this? (leave a comment if you do!)</li>
<li>Convert it to a group element. To do this we simply consider <code>w</code> a scalar and do a scalar multiplication with a generator of our subgroup (<code>M</code> or <code>N</code> depending if you're the client or the server, can you guess why we use <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1194.pdf">different generators</a>?)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: If you know BLS or OPAQUE, you might be wondering why we don't use a "hash-to-curve" algorithm, this is because we don't need to obtain a group element with an unknown discrete logarithm in SPAKE2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the blinded (with the password) public keys have been exchanged, both sides can compute a shared group element:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice computes <code>K = h × alice_private_key × (S - w × N)</code></li>
<li>Bob computes <code>K = h × bob_private_key × (T - w × M)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Spend a bit of your time to understand these equations.
What happens is that both Alice and Bob first unblind the public key they've received, then perform a key exchange with it, then multiply it with the value <code>h</code>. What's this value <code>h</code>? The cofactor, or simply put: the other annoying subgroup.</p>
<p>Finally Alice and Bob <strong>hash the whole transcript</strong>, which is the concatenation of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice's identity.</li>
<li>Bob's identity.</li>
<li>The message Bob sent <code>S</code>.</li>
<li>The message Alice sent <code>T</code>.</li>
<li>The shared group element <code>K</code>.</li>
<li>The hardened password <code>w</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hash of this transcript gives us two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>shared secret</strong> !</li>
<li>A key that is further expanded (via a KDF) to obtain two authentication keys.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="The key derivation of sPAKE" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2020-02-09_at_5.55_.57_PM_.png"></p>
<p>These authentication keys sole purpose is to provide <strong>key confirmation</strong> in the last round-trip of messages.
That is to say at this point, if we don't do anything, we don't know if either Alice or Bob truly managed to compute the shared secret.</p>
<p>Key confirmation is pretty simple, both sides just have to compute an authentication tag with one of the authentication key produced over the transcript.</p>
<p>The final protocol looks a bit dense, but you should be able to decipher it if you've read this far.</p>
