  <h4 id="TOC_1.">What a year!</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    2018 was a great year for the Go ecosystem, with


    package management as one of our major focuses.


    In February, we started a community-wide discussion about how to integrate


    package management directly into the Go toolchain,


    and in August we delivered the first rough implementation of that feature,


    called Go modules, in Go 1.11.


    The migration to Go modules will be the most far-reaching change


    for the Go ecosystem since Go 1.


    Converting the entire ecosystem‚Äîcode, users, tools, and so on‚Äîfrom


    GOPATH to modules will require work in many different areas.


    The module system will in turn help us deliver


    better authentication and build speeds to the Go ecosystem.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    This post is a preview of what the Go team is planning


    relating to modules in 2019.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_2.">Releases</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    Go 1.11, released in August 2018, introduced <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.11#modules" target="_blank">preliminary support for modules</a>.


    For now, module support is maintained alongside the


    traditional GOPATH-based mechanisms.


    The <code>go</code> command defaults to module mode when run


    in directory trees outside GOPATH/src and


    marked by <code>go.mod</code> files in their roots.


    This setting can be overridden by setting the transitional


    environment variable <code>$GO111MODULE</code> to <code>on</code> or <code>off</code>;


    the default behavior is <code>auto</code> mode.


    We‚Äôve already seen significant adoption of modules across the Go community,


    along with many helpful suggestions and bug reports


    to help us improve modules.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Go 1.12, scheduled for February 2019, will refine module support


    but still leave it in <code>auto</code> mode by default.


    In addition to many bug fixes and other minor improvements,


    perhaps the most significant change in Go 1.12


    is that commands like <code>go</code> <code>run</code> <code>x.go</code>


    or <code>go</code> <code>get</code> <code>rsc.io/2fa@v1.1.0</code>


    can now operate in <code>GO111MODULE=on</code> mode without an explicit <code>go.mod</code> file.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Our aim is for Go 1.13, scheduled for August 2019, to enable module mode by


    default (that is, to change the default from <code>auto</code> to <code>on</code>)


    and deprecate GOPATH mode.


    In order to do that, we‚Äôve been working on better tooling support


    along with better support for the open-source module ecosystem.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_3.">Tooling &amp; IDE Integration</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    In the eight years that we‚Äôve had GOPATH,


    an incredible amount of tooling has been created


    that assumes Go source code is stored in GOPATH.


    Moving to modules requires updating all code that makes


    that assumption.


    We‚Äôve designed a new package,


    <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/go/packages" target="_blank">golang.org/x/tools/go/packages</a>,


    that abstracts the operation of finding and loading information


    about the Go source code for a given target.


    This new package adapts automatically to both


    GOPATH and modules mode and is also extensible


    to tool-specific code layouts, such as the one


    used by Bazel.


    We‚Äôve been working with tool authors throughout the Go community


    to help them adopt golang.org/x/tools/go/packages in their tools.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    As part of this effort, we‚Äôve also been working to


    unify the various source code querying tools


    like gocode, godef, and go-outline


    into a single tool that can be used from the


    command line and also supports


    the <a href="https://langserver.org/" target="_blank">language server protocol</a>


    used by modern IDEs.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    The transition to modules and the changes in package loading


    also prompted a significant change to Go program analysis.


    As part of reworking <code>go</code> <code>vet</code> to support modules,


    we introduced a generalized framework for incremental


    analysis of Go programs,


    in which an analyzer is invoked for one package at a time.


    In this framework, the analysis of one package can write out facts


    made available to analyses of other packages that import the first.


    For example, <code>go</code> <code>vet</code>‚Äôs analysis of the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/log/" target="_blank">log package</a>


    determines and records the fact that <code>log.Printf</code> is a <code>fmt.Printf</code> wrapper.


    Then <code>go</code> <code>vet</code> can check printf-style format strings in other packages


    that call <code>log.Printf</code>.


    This framework should enable many new, sophisticated


    program analysis tools to help developers find bugs earlier


    and understand code better.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_4.">Module Index</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    One of the most important parts of the original design for <code>go</code> <code>get</code>


    was that it was <i>decentralized</i>:


    we believed then‚Äîand we still believe today‚Äîthat


    anyone should be able to publish their code on any server,


    in contrast to central registries


    such as Perl‚Äôs CPAN, Java‚Äôs Maven, or Node‚Äôs NPM.


    Placing domain names at the start of the <code>go</code> <code>get</code> import space


    reused an existing decentralized system


    and avoided needing to solve anew the problems of


    deciding who can use which names.


    It also allowed companies to import code on private servers


    alongside code from public servers.


    It is critical to preserve this decentralization as we shift to Go modules.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Decentralization of Go‚Äôs dependencies has had many benefits,


    but it also brought a few significant drawbacks.


    The first is that it‚Äôs too hard to find all the publicly-available Go packages.


    Every site that wants to deliver information about


    packages has


    to do its own crawling, or else wait until a user asks


    about a particular package before fetching it.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    We are working on a new service, the Go Module Index,


    that will provide a public log of packages entering the Go ecosystem.


    Sites like godoc.org and goreportcard.com will be able to watch this log


    for new entries instead of each independently implementing code


    to find new packages.


    We also want the service to allow looking up packages


    using simple queries, to allow <code>goimports</code> to add


    imports for packages that have not yet been downloaded to the local system.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_5.">Module Authentication</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    Today, <code>go</code> <code>get</code> relies on connection-level authentication (HTTPS or SSH)


    to check that it is talking to the right server to download code.


    There is no additional check of the code itself,


    leaving open the possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks


    if the HTTPS or SSH mechanisms are compromised in some way.


    Decentralization means that the code for a build is fetched


    from many different servers, which means the build depends on


    many systems to serve correct code.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    The Go modules design improves code authentication by storing


    a <code>go.sum</code> file in each module;


    that file lists the cryptographic hash


    of the expected file tree for each of the module‚Äôs dependencies.


    When using modules, the <code>go</code> command uses <code>go.sum</code> to verify


    that dependencies are bit-for-bit identical to the expected versions


    before using them in a build.


    But the <code>go.sum</code> file only lists hashes for the specific dependencies


    used by that module.


    If you are adding a new dependency


    or updating dependencies with <code>go</code> <code>get</code> <code>-u</code>,


    there is no corresponding entry in <code>go.sum</code> and therefore


    no direct authentication of the downloaded bits.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    For publicly-available modules, we intend to run a service we call a <i>notary</i>


    that follows the module index log,


    downloads new modules,


    and cryptographically signs statements of the form


    ‚Äúmodule M at version V has file tree hash H.‚Äù


    The notary service will publish all these notarized hashes


    in a queryable, <a href="https://www.certificate-transparency.org/" target="_blank">Certificate Transparency</a>-style


    <a href="http://static.usenix.org/event/sec09/tech/full_papers/crosby.pdf" target="_blank">tamper-proof log</a>,


    so that anyone can verify that the notary is behaving correctly.


    This log will serve as a public, global <code>go.sum</code> file


    that <code>go</code> <code>get</code> can use to authenticate modules


    when adding or updating dependencies.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    We are aiming to have the <code>go</code> command check notarized hashes


    for publicly-available modules not already in <code>go.sum</code>


    starting in Go 1.13.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_6.">Module Mirrors</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    Because the decentralized <code>go</code> <code>get</code> fetches code from multiple origin servers,


    fetching code is only as fast and reliable as the slowest,


    least reliable server.


    The only defense available before modules was to vendor


    dependencies into your own repositories.


    While vendoring will continue to be supported,


    we‚Äôd prefer a solution that works for all modules‚Äînot just the ones you‚Äôre already using‚Äîand


    that does not require duplicating a dependency into every


    repository that uses it.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    The Go module design introduces the idea of a module proxy,


    which is a server that the <code>go</code> command asks for modules,


    instead of the origin servers.


    One important kind of proxy is a <i>module mirror</i>,


    which answers requests for modules by fetching them


    from origin servers and then caching them for use in


    future requests.


    A well-run mirror should be fast and reliable


    even when some origin servers have gone down.


    We are planning to launch a mirror service for publicly-available modules in 2019.


    Other projects, like GoCenter and Athens, are planning mirror services too.


    (We anticipate that companies will have multiple options for running


    their own internal mirrors as well, but this post is focusing on public mirrors.)
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    One potential problem with mirrors is that they are


    precisely man-in-the-middle servers,


    making them a natural target for attacks.


    Go developers need some assurance that the mirrors


    are providing the same bits that the origin servers would.


    The notary process we described in the previous section


    addresses exactly this concern, and it


    will apply to downloads using mirrors


    as well as downloads using origin servers.


    The mirrors themselves need not be trusted.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    We are aiming to have the Google-run module mirror


    ready to be used by default in the <code>go</code> command starting in Go 1.13.


    Using an alternate mirror, or no mirror at all, will be trivial


    to configure.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_7.">Module Discovery</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    Finally, we mentioned earlier that the module index will make it easier to


    build sites like godoc.org.


    Part of our work in 2019 will be a major revamp of godoc.org


    to make it more useful for developers who need to


    discover available modules


    and then decide whether to rely on a given module or not.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_8.">Big Picture</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    This diagram shows how module source code


    moves through the design in this post.
  </p>
  

<p><img src="https://blog.golang.org/modules2019/code.png" width="374" alt="">
</p>

  
  <p>
    Before, all consumers of Go source code‚Äîthe <code>go</code> command


    and any sites like godoc.org‚Äîfetched code directly from each code host.


    Now they can fetch cached code from a fast, reliable mirror,


    while still authenticating that the downloaded bits are correct.


    And the index service makes it easy for mirrors, godoc.org,


    and any other similar sites to keep up with all the great new


    code being added to the Go ecosystem every day.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    We‚Äôre excited about the future of Go modules in 2019,


    and we hope you are too. Happy New Year!
