<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="speakable-summary">A hacker who stole close to 620 million user records from 16 websites has stolen another 127 million records from eight more websites, TechCrunch has learned.</p><p>The hacker, whose listing was the previously disclosed data for about $20,000 in bitcoin on a dark web marketplace, stole the data last year from several major sites — some that had already been disclosed, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/29/under-armour-says-myfitnesspal-data-breach-affected-150-million-users/">more than 151 million records from MyFitnessPal</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/20/animoto-hack-exposes-personal-information-geolocation-data/">25 million records from Animoto</a>. But several other hacked sites on the marketplace listing didn’t know or hadn’t disclosed yet — such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223660/500px-security-breach-14-8-million-users-personal-information-stolen-cybersecurity">500px</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/happy-valentines-day-your-dating-app-account-was-hacked-says-coffee-meets-bagel/">Coffee Meets Bagel</a>.</p><p>The Register, which <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/">first reported the story</a>, said the data included names, email addresses and scrambled passwords, and in some cases other login and account data — though no financial data was included.</p><p>Now the same hacker has eight additional marketplace entries after their original listings were pulled offline, including:</p><ul><li>18 million records from travel booking site Ixigo</li><li>Live-video streaming site YouNow had 40 million records stolen</li><li>Houzz, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/houzz-data-breach/">recently disclosed a data breach</a>, is listed with 57 million records stolen</li><li>Ge.tt had 1.8 million accounts stolen</li><li>450,000 records from cryptocurrency site Coinmama.</li><li>Roll20, a gaming site, had 4 million records listed</li><li>Stronghold Kingdoms, a multiplayer online game, had 5 million records listed</li><li>1 million records from pet care delivery service PetFlow</li></ul><p>According to the hacker’s listings, Ixigo and <a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/petflow" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="petflow">PetFlow <span></span></a> used the old and outdated MD5 hashing algorithm to scramble passwords, which these days is easy to unscramble. YouNow doesn’t store passwords, a spokesperson said.</p><p>In all, the hacker is selling the hacked data for about $14,500 in bitcoin.</p><p><div id="attachment_1783818"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1783818" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-2.12.44-PM1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="806" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-2.12.44-PM1.png 1888w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-2.12.44-PM1.png?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-2.12.44-PM1.png?resize=300,236 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-2.12.44-PM1.png?resize=768,604 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-2.12.44-PM1.png?resize=680,535 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-2.12.44-PM1.png?resize=1536,1209 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-2.12.44-PM1.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1783818">The dark web marketplace listing for Houzz. (Image: TechCrunch)</p></div></p><p>Ariel Ainhoren, research team leader at Israeli security firm IntSights, said that the hacker may have used the same security flaw to target vulnerable sites.</p><p>Six of the 16 databases were running the same back-end PostgreSQL database software, said Ainhoren in an email to TechCrunch. In successfully exploiting the bug, the hacker was able to “dump” the database to a file and download it.</p><p>“We’re still analyzing it, but it could have been that he used some kind of vulnerability that surfaced around that time and wasn’t patched by these companies or a totally new unknown vulnerability,” he said. “As most of these sites were not known breaches, it seems we’re dealing here with a hacker that did the hacks by himself, and not just someone who obtained it from somewhere else and now just resold it.”</p><p>When reached, Jonathan Katz, a contributor for PostgreSQL, said the open-source project was “currently unaware of any patched or unpatched vulnerabilities that could have caused these breaches.”</p><p>“There are many factors that need to be taken into consideration when securing a database system that go beyond the database software. We have often found that data breaches into a PostgreSQL database involve an indirect attack vector, such as a flaw in an application accessing PostgreSQL or a suboptimal policy around data management,” he said. “When it comes to vulnerabilities, the PostgreSQL community has a dedicated security team that evaluates and fixes issues and, in the spirit of open source collaboration, transparently reports on and educates our users about them.”</p></div></div></div>
