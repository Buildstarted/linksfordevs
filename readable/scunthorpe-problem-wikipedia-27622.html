<p>The <b>Scunthorpe problem</b> is the unintentional blocking of websites, e-mails, forum posts or search results by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_filter" title="Spam filter">spam filter</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine" title="Search engine">search engine</a>  because their text contains a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)" title="String (computer science)">string</a> of letters that appear to have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity" title="Obscenity">obscene</a> or otherwise unacceptable meaning. Names, abbreviations, and technical terms are most often cited as being affected by the issue.
</p><p>The problem arises since computers can easily identify strings of text within a document, but interpreting words of this kind requires considerable ability to interpret a wide range of contexts, possibly across many cultures, which is an extremely difficult task. As a result, broad blocking rules may result in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive" title="False positive">false positives</a> affecting innocent phrases.

<p>The problem was named after an incident in 1996 in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" title="AOL">AOL</a>'s profanity filter prevented residents of the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe" title="Scunthorpe">Scunthorpe</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Lincolnshire" title="North Lincolnshire">North Lincolnshire</a>, England, from creating accounts with AOL, because the town's name contains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring" title="Substring">substring</a> "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunt" title="Cunt">cunt</a>".<sup id="cite_ref-risks_digest_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-risks_digest-1">[1]</a></sup>

<li>In 2008, the filter of the free wireless service of the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whakatane" title="Whakatane">Whakatane</a> in New Zealand blocked searches involving the town's own name because the filter's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_algorithm" title="Phonetic algorithm">phonetic analysis</a> deemed the "whak" to sound like <i>fuck</i>; the town name is in Maori, and in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maori_language" title="Maori language">Maori language</a> "wh" is most commonly pronounced as "f".
