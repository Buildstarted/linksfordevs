          <p>This plan seems more than fair. Between the permissive compatibility you‚Äôre planning to add to the AGPLv3 terms and the amnesty to allow continued use of Apache 2.0, there‚Äôs clearly an effort to reduce the impact on open source consumers.</p>
<p>I do have some general thoughts...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open Source means different things to different members of the community</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the things I‚Äôve been learning recently is that many developers have a <em>very strong opinion</em> of exactly what ‚Äúopen source‚Äù means. I don‚Äôt want to debate the exact meaning (I‚Äôve done plenty of that on the Twitters and have no desire to continue arguing about what is ultimately a subjective opinion), but it‚Äôs important to understand how loaded this phrase is when discussing commercialization and funding of openly developed projects.</p>
<p>To many, ‚Äúopen source‚Äù refers specifically and only to OSI and FSF approved licensing schemes. Using the term to describe projects that deviate from this often results in a focus on that language instead of a focus on the license, the project, or the problems being addressed via licensing.</p>
<p>In order to avoid getting caught up in discussions over semantics, I‚Äôve stopped using the phrase ‚Äúopen source‚Äù to describe these kinds of projects when I can (even though I think it should apply <g-emoji alias="zipper_mouth_face" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f910.png">ü§ê</g-emoji>). Instead I‚Äôve been experimenting with ‚Äúopenly developed‚Äù, ‚Äúsource available‚Äù, and ‚Äúequitable source‚Äù (I rather like that last one). Just something to consider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking at open collective I can see that it‚Äôs unfortunately not generating any significant revenues</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can't you also make service to monetize? Like prioritize a merge request &amp;/ issue buy paying. This way you can keep a permissive license</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a few notable exceptions, donation-based and other purely optional funding models like paying for issues just don‚Äôt work. That‚Äôs especially true for the .NET community - I can‚Äôt think of a successful .NET project that‚Äôs raised meaningful capital without placing restrictions <em>on use</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôd be curious to hear more background on how you arrived to that decision. What other options have been considered etc..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think everyone would <em>like</em> to see optional funding schemes like donations work out. No one gets into or sticks with openly developed projects for the money. That said, there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to share in the value generated by software you write. It doesn‚Äôt even require an excuse like ‚Äúwe want to work on this full time‚Äù (though good on the team for having that goal). If the maintainers of a project decide that they would like to participate in the monetary gains of others due in part to their work, we should support and encourage that IMO.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>don't you guys worry that having to pay for a license could drive away contributors?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I fear that other developers in the same situation could just think it's not worth it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve started to advocate that maybe user count (and by extension, contributor count) as the sole metric of project success isn‚Äôt healthy. Each consumer is obviously totally free to choose whether they would like to use a project under the stated terms or not. That‚Äôs also true for contributors.</p>
<p>A contributor should not be expending effort on a contribution if they don‚Äôt like being held to the terms of the project once the contribution is done. There are plenty of reasons why a contributor might still choose to contribute like they need a feature in the box, they like the project regardless of licensing, etc. And maybe some <em>will</em> be driven away. That‚Äôs okay too and shouldn‚Äôt be seen as the project being unsuccessful - it‚Äôs the natural result of maintainers, consumers, and contributors finding an equilibrium they can all live with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we want to ensure that our license plans do not jeopardize dotnet foundation membership in any manner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a point I disagree with James on. My understanding is that the .NET Foundation is primarily interested in permissive-only projects. I understand and appreciate that position. I think it becomes a trade off of what benefit the Foundation provides vs. the benefit of a commercial licensing strategy. It‚Äôs okay for a project not to be in the Foundation - it shouldn‚Äôt indicate anything about the stability, maturity, or success of a project either way.</p>
<p>Also note that while commercial companies are <em>members</em> of the Foundation, their commercial products are not Foundation <em>projects</em> (as far as I know - correct me if I‚Äôm wrong).</p>
