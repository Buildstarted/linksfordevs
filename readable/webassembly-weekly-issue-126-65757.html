        <p>This week Mozilla announced a significant round of lay-offs (their second in 2020), which has left 25% of their staff looking for new jobs. I’m going to steer clear of the politics and simply state that I find this very sad news. Mozilla has been a deeply influential company that has touched a great many parts of the world wide web, not least the part they have played in WebAssembly. For that reason, I am dedicating this issue to Mozilla and celebrating the work they have done.</p>

<h3 id="asmjs"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js">asm.js</a></h3>

<p><small>WIKIPEDIA.ORG</small></p>

<p>Around 7 years ago a team at Mozilla unveiled asm.js, a slightly odd looking JavaScript subset that was able to approach native execution speeds through the use of type-hints, a lack of garbage collection and various optimisations in the Firefox browser. I must admit, when I first saw asm.js I just didn’t “get” it! However, clearly others did.</p>

<p>asm.js was very much a proof of concept for WebAssembly, demonstrating that a simple low-level virtual machine could be embedded within the browser and the initial WebAssembly implementation was very much modelled on asm.js.</p>

<p>Without Mozilla’s asm.js project it seems quite unlikely that WebAssembly would have had the backing it needed to succeed.</p>

<p>When launching a new technology being awesome isn’t enough - you need to educate people, teach them what this new technology is, why it matters and how to use it. This seminal blog series from Lin Clark takes a complicated technology and makes it easy to understand through clear and engaging writing and great illustrations.</p>

<h3 id="javascript-to-rust-and-back-again-a-wasm-bindgen-tale"><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/04/javascript-to-rust-and-back-again-a-wasm-bindgen-tale/">JavaScript to Rust and Back Again: A wasm-bindgen Tale</a></h3>

<p><small>MOZILLA.ORG</small></p>

<p>One of the most challenging (and limiting) aspects of WebAssembly at the moment is building a suitable interface between WebAssembly and the JavaScript host. Mozilla’s wasm-bindgen was an early trailblazer, allowing automatic generation of ‘bindings’ making it very easy for Rust and JavaScript to communicate with each other.</p>

<p><small>GITHUB.COM</small></p>

<p>While WebAssembly was initially designed for the web, it has has started to find success in a great many contexts including blockchain, edge, serverless and IoT. Bytecode Alliance is a group of companies that are creating standards to support the adoption of WebAssembly beyond the web, and Mozilla has been a significant part of this. They also contributed wasmtime, their standalone WebAssembly runtime, to Bytecode Alliance - a fantastic tool for anyone wanting to try our WASI (WebAssembly System Interface).</p>

<p><small>MOZILLA.ORG</small></p>

<p>With WebAssembly being a new technology it needs some eye-catching and thought-provoking demonstrations in order to attract adopters. Pyodide does just that. This post describes how the team brought a Python data science stack to the browser. An amazing and very practical demonstration of what WebAssembly is capable of.</p>
