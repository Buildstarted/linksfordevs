  We wanted to make a website that looked like it was from the
  1990s. Sounds easy, right? Looking back from 2020, the aesthetic of
  the early World Wide Web stands out for the things it lacked: no
  CSS, emojis, fancy web fonts or non-web-safe colours. Black Times
  New Roman on a grey background, something like this:
</p>
<p><img src="https://vistaserv.net/assets/blog/foo-html-chrome-ccfce3a6bd04a674f13956c6614e4ee656df418c46cc438da9dd487f1a3c5fc3.png"></p><p>
  That's simple and austere, but it doesn't really feel retro or
  nostalgic, does it? Initially, we weren't even sure what was lacking
  – we've clearly been living in the 21st century for too long.
</p>
<p>
  But when you open the same HTML file in Internet Explorer 5, running
  in a Windows 2000 virtual machine, it looks quite different:
</p>
<p><img src="https://vistaserv.net/assets/blog/foo-html-ie5-1387b8a0042982cff9cd8a8e009fe780eb9aa8ca2afc09ba3de77f94998dc1eb.png"></p><p>
  Seeing that brought back a strong wave of nostalgia. Beyond the
  old-timey browser chrome and the different default treatment of
  tables, the text itself looks really different:
</p>
<p><img src="https://vistaserv.net/assets/blog/foobar-antialiased-abdac32f141459a33bc6bd05075a7a3c620fc764d3b9a8b401ff0599b15936a3.png">
<img src="https://vistaserv.net/assets/blog/foobar-ie5-b0aa394a9929b2c39a713239e3cfc4774b778ed637c2d442e0307ac7caa731ca.png"></p><p>
  Antialiasing is another thing that the 90s web lacked, and it makes
  a surprisingly big difference. Even in the early 2000s, when CRT
  monitors were still widespread, the Apple and Microsoft operating
  systems had made fundamentally different choices when it came to
  font rendering. Mac OS X offered smoothed, dithered text, using
  shades of grey pixels to suggest contours, while Windows followed a
  strongly hinted approach, with strokes well-aligned to pixels,
  giving a much sharper, high-contrast feel.
</p>

  <figcaption>
    The left-hand image is a screenshot of Mac OS X 10.1 Puma, the right-hand
    image is of Windows 2000. Both date from the very early 2000s, but
    you can see the stark difference in approach to font rendering.
    These screenshots have not been modified at all, except for
    enlarging them to 200% with nearest-neighbour interpolation.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Ultimately there isn't a rational justification for why we decided
  to mimic the early 2000s Windows style of rendering, but seeing
  those old browsers in Windows virtual machines resonated most with
  us, felt most.. <em>retro</em>. And so, we decided to try and
  replicate that look and feel in modern browsers.
</p>


<h2>Idea #1: CSS</h2>
<p>
  "Great", we thought, "we'll use CSS to take care of that". CSS in
  2020 can do amazing things like rendering vector graphics and
  animations, so surely it should make short work of jagged fonts. But
  our hopes were quickly dashed by a web search. In the middle of page
  after page of StackOverflow posts from people who wanted to make
  their fonts <em>less</em> jagged, we found that there isn't really a
  universal way to disable antialiasing using CSS. There's a
  non-standard <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-smooth">font-smooth
  property</a> that didn't make the cut for the CSS3 spec, but that
  doesn't work in all browsers, and worst of all, the results didn't
  quite hit the mark: the pixels were visible, but the resolution was
  way too high. Developers often lament the difficulty of designing
  for Retina screens, but we were having the opposite problem.
</p>
<p><img src="https://vistaserv.net/assets/blog/foobar-font-smooth-6e775faab5bdd5388d6d7d91fd94faa59b2227d40cfbb9fb2f38266b5275f2c3.png"></p><p>
  It seems pretty settled that antialiasing is set at the OS level,
  and individual websites are discouraged from messing with that.
  Mostly that's because it's bad for accessibility, but in any case
  the font-smooth property is not part of the standards, and likely
  won't be in the future. And that's sensible. But making a website
  today that looks like it's from 1996 is not a sensible exercise
  either, so we continued on our quest for pixellated typographic
  perfection.
</p>
<h2>Idea #2: Importing bitmap font files</h2>

<p>
  We couldn't make vector fonts look pixelated, but could we get
  around this by importing authentic 90s bitmap font files instead? We
  had a Windows 98 disk image with all of the system fonts including
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Serif">MS Serif</a>: a
  riff on Times New Roman in the bitmap <tt>.FON</tt> format dating
  back to Windows 1.x. Unfortunately, we quickly found out that
  CSS <tt>@font-face</tt> doesn't work with <tt>.FON</tt> files, and
  none of the web-based font conversion tools that we could find would
  convert them to the vector formats that are usable with
  <tt>@font-face</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Idea #3: FontForge</h2>

<p>
  While searching for tools to convert bitmap font files we came
  across <a href="https://fontforge.org/en-US/">FontForge</a> - a free
  and open source font editor. It looked impressively fully-featured
  and had a huge number of supported formats, so we were cautiously
  optimistic that we could make it work for us.
</p>
<p>
  Fontforge can convert fonts from vector to bitmap formats by
  creating <a href="https://fontforge.org/docs/tutorial/editexample8.html">bitmap
  strikes</a>. Basically, a strike of a vector font, means its glyphs
  have been rasterised at a particular pixel size. Rasterisation at
  different sizes is important, because on an old-fashioned
  low-resolution screen, this is essentially what's happening: when
  rendering your text, the font is rasterised for your particular
  pixel density.  For example, on a 75DPI screen, your 12 point font
  becomes 16 pixels high. These 16 pixels are big enough that you see
  them as jagged edges.  However, if you're displaying 48 point text
  (a large heading, for example) on that same old-fashioned screen,
  you'll rasterise the font at 64 pixels, so already it'll seem much
  smoother. This will come back and complicate our life later on.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://vistaserv.net/assets/blog/12-24-32pt%20rasterisation%20illustration-ee7f2298cecbada38954356e3ba11c8fab07d65e56c6b37483c8c67b6ae431a1.png">
  <figcaption>
    Notice in this screenshot (taken in Windows 2000) how at different
    point sizes, the rasterisation of the text is clearly different.
    This is why we can't simply make a bitmap font at one size and scale
    it up – every size we want a pixellated font, we need to have
    a bitmap strike available.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  FontForge has the ability to work with other free software that
  traces the visual information conveyed by pixels into points, lines
  and curves, allowing you to convert bitmap fonts back into vector
  formats. This was promising!
</p>
<p>
  We made a bitmap strike of Times New Roman at 16px, and it was a
  pixel-perfect match of what we saw in IE5!
</p>
<p><img src="https://vistaserv.net/assets/blog/foobar-ie5-b0aa394a9929b2c39a713239e3cfc4774b778ed637c2d442e0307ac7caa731ca.png">
<img src="https://vistaserv.net/assets/blog/fontforge%20bitmap%20strike-cf0fd3836f37f8955534f586fb9110f4015b414ec517e272031901a6027b6c74.png"></p><p>
  Elated, we
  installed <a href="http://potrace.sourceforge.net/">potrace</a> and
  told FontForge to use it to trace our pixellated version of Times.
</p>
<p>
  This was the result:
</p>
<p><img src="https://vistaserv.net/assets/blog/blobby-potrace-27dacfac1dbddb19d22b17ec112428bd72a7a35a497028f8a14e4ef308102d7d.png"></p><p>
  Potrace was doing its best to turn jagged pixels into smooth curves,
  and the result was a blobby mess.
</p>
<p><img src="https://vistaserv.net/assets/blog/blobby-potrace-a-928907f482e071af3a9a17056eee6622dae15a49d4317a472c042776dbacbc78.png"></p><h2>Idea #4: Scaling up</h2>
<p>
  Some further searching
  unearthed <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/55020647/4997000">the
  idea</a> of scaling up the bitmap font before tracing to give
  potrace a higher-resolution input to work with. In our 16px bitmap
  version of Times we created a second, 80px strike, so it looked the
  same but the resolution was five times higher. We held our breath
  and repeated the autotrace…

</p>
<p><img src="https://vistaserv.net/assets/blog/autotrace-scaled-up-5784c5caa6f3b21812d93dee274905e3791387c058f57d50da907308b34f03b0.png"></p><p>
  Success at last!
</p>
<p>
  We were thrilled with the way this looked, but the whole process was
  very manual. We would need to do this for the regular, bold and
  italic variants of Times, and if we wanted headings to look
  pixel-perfect we would need to trace different strike sizes as
  well. We wondered, was there a way we could automate this?
</p>
<h2>Automating things</h2>
<p>
  Ideally, even if we limited ourselves to Times New Roman only, we
  wanted to have Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic font weights
  available, and since we wanted text to look reasonable at various
  sizes in the browser, we would also need to create strikes at a few
  different pixel sizes at least. For example, body text at 16px, but
  also 24px and 32px for headings, to be able to display them with
  appropriate levels of jaggedness – not too little, but definitely
  also not too much. As illustrated above, you wouldn't want to strike
  at 16px and then scale up to heading size.  That would already mean
  4x3 = 12 variants of that one font alone.  And of course, we
  wouldn't be satisfied if we didn't also have MS Comic Sans and
  Lucida Handwriting available for our users ;). This would've taken
  us hours, if not days, to accomplish manually.
</p>
<p>
  We were full of hope, however, because FontForge is supposed to be
  scriptable using Python. Unfortunately, it doesn't act like a real
  library that you install with <tt>pip install fontforge</tt> or similar,
  you have to somehow invoke your Python script through FontForge, or
  something like that.  It was too difficult for us.  It also seemed
  as if for a font without any strikes (so, all vector TTFs), you
  couldn't create a first strike in Python.  This might just be us
  misunderstanding it – either way, the interface was arcane at best.
  Luckily, there's also the scripting interface the author dryly
  refers to as "<a href="https://fontforge.org/docs/scripting/scripting.html">a legacy language [the author] came up with</a>".  That
  sounds about obscure enough for a project like ours. It turns out
  that the functions available when scripting FontForge are very close
  similes of performing the actions manually in the UI.  So we
  dutifully came up with a procedure for generating one font –
  glossing over some details:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Open the TTF file (e.g., Times New Roman from Windows 98)
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a bitmap strike at 16px
  </li>
  <li>
    Create bitmap strike at 5x desired
    pixel size (for a 16px font, strike at 80px) – FontForge
    automatically scales it up with nearest-neighbour interpolation
  </li>
  <li>
    Get rid of any vector information
  </li>
  <li>
    Invoke "autotrace" – in our case the potrace binary, which gives
    back vector information from input bitmap
  </li>
  <li>
    Save that result as a WOFF file (vector-based web-font, usable in
    modern browsers)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Although that sounded easy, we soon hit some snags. For example,
  while the UI allowed us to resize strikes in FontForge, inside a
  script step 3 would cause a hard segfault.  That was quite
  disappointing, to say the least.  We tried everything we could think
  of, but couldn't work around that bug, and as we illustrated above,
  it was crucial for our pixellated fonts. Just when we thought we
  were defeated, another approach surfaced: instead of trying to do
  the heavy lifting in FontForge, why not wrap or modify potrace
  instead?  It turns out that somebody out
  there <a href="https://github.com/koemaeda/potrace-pixelperfect/">has
  already done that</a>. We quickly set to work trying to integrate
  that into our font pipeline, and finally got it to work!  It was
  slow to run and arduous to figure out, but definitely did the job
  much better than us manually poking at the FontForge UI.  The
  results were quite rough out of the box, though.  We had to apply
  heaps of little fixes like removing mysterious artefacts from the
  'space' characters, copying the asterisk into the position of the
  'middle dot' to get nice password mask, among other things. But with
  many tries and lots of tweaking for speed and aesthetics, we ended
  up with the fonts you're looking at right now on this website (be
  sure to check out the <a href="https://vistaserv.net/sitebuilder/wizard">Home Page Builder Wizard®</a> for more!).  At least, assuming you have
  webfonts enabled and are using Chrome or Safari – we're still
  relying a bit on that deprecated font-smooth CSS property to make
  things pixel-perfect.
