<p>v3.0 is now <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/protobuf-net/" rel="nofollow">available on NuGet</a>, and brings exciting new improvements - and some necessary changes. For most people 3.0 should be
a simple update. A few niche features have changed or been removed - more details below. The library tries to guide you at build time if you are particularly impacted.</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>buffer-focused APIs: like many serializers, protobuf-net has historically been focused on the <code>Stream</code> API, but recent advances in .NET IO have brought more
focus on things like <code>ReadOnlyMemory&lt;byte&gt;</code>, <code>ReadOnlySequence&lt;byte&gt;</code>, and <code>IBufferWriter&lt;byte&gt;</code>; protobuf-net is now able to directly utilize the APIs, to allow use
with modern .NET IO primitives without intermediate layers. Since there are performance advantages to these APIs, protobuf-net will also try to detect scenarios where
it can <em>use</em> these features - for example, if you try to deserialize from a <code>MemoryStream</code>, protobuf-net will use <code>TryGetBuffer</code> to access the underlying memory
directly when possible</li>
<li>new serializer core for AOT: the heart of the serialize and deserialize code has been heavily refactored, as part of in-progress work to enable full AOT usage via the proposed
"generators" C# language feature; this work is not yet fully available (as the compiler changes are still in preview), but the building blocks are in place and have
been validated; AOT usage will be entirely optional, and targets both cold-start performance for "full" runtimes, and ref-emit avoidance for AOT environments like mobile
devices and gaming platforms</li>
<li>new custom serializer API: there is a new API at the heart of protobuf-net that allows custom serializers to be defined in C# - both for messages and primitive values; this
API is not yet intended for "consumer" use - that is a later v3 stage - but: it is already opening up a lot of options for the engine, and offers <em>future</em> extensibility for
consumers</li>
<li>performance: the use of modern APIs, plus additional changes (things like <code>ArrayPool&lt;T&gt;</code> usage) should see performance improvements for most callers, in both
serialization and deserialization; note that for 3.0 the only <em>aim</em> was "no performance regression" (with a later 3.something deliverable being an in-depth
performance review), so getting a performance increase here was a free win!</li>
<li>pre-measurement of payloads: in a lot of cases, it is necessary to know the <em>length</em> of a payload <em>before</em> you actually write it - for example, for an HTTP <code>Content-Length</code>
header; previously this has required serializing the object fully to a buffer, writing the buffer length, then copying the buffer; a new <code>Measure&lt;T&gt;</code> API now allows
the caller to perform a pre-computation of the length in advance, in a way that allows the library to <em>reuse</em> that knowledge in the anticipated serialize that will surely
follow, which in turn makes the final serialize a "forwards only" affair</li>
<li>compatibiliy level API: this extends the <code>DataFormat.WellKnown</code> concept from v2 allowing granular changes to how common data types are serialized;
this is discussed <a href="https://protobuf-net.github.io/protobuf-net/compatibilitylevel" rel="nofollow">in more depth here</a> - thanks here go to <a href="https://servicestack.net/" rel="nofollow">ServiceStack</a>, who
both inspired and sponsored these improvements</li>
<li>capability API: since there are some changes in v3.0 that might make it not a perfect update for everyone, <strong>libraries</strong> that <em>consume</em> protobuf-net might not want to take
a hard 3.0 dependency, but might still want to <em>use</em> the 3.0 features when they are available; new capability APIs make this possible - for example,
<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/protobuf-net.Grpc/" rel="nofollow">protobuf-net.Grpc</a> uses this, allowing it to use the "contextual serializer" gRPC API when 3.0 APIs are detected,
or the legacy <code>byte[]</code> API otherwise); this works via interfaces that are
<em>advertised</em> in the later 2.4 releases, but not <em>implemented</em> until 3.0; in particular, you can now test a <code>TypeModel</code> for:
<ul>
<li>input - <code>IProtoInput&lt;T&gt;</code> where <code>T</code> is any of:
<ul>
<li>2.4 and 3.0: <code>Stream</code>, <code>ArraySegment&lt;byte&gt;</code>, <code>byte[]</code></li>
<li>3.0 only: <code>ReadOnlyMemory&lt;byte&gt;</code>, <code>ReadOnlySequence&lt;byte&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>output - <code>IProtoInput&lt;T&gt;</code> where <code>T</code> is any of:
<ul>
<li>2.4 and 3.0: <code>Stream</code></li>
<li>3.0 only: <code>IBufferWriter&lt;byte&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>output with measurement - <code>IMeasuredProtoOutput&lt;T&gt;</code> where <code>T</code> is any of:
<ul>
<li>3.0 only: <code>Stream</code>, <code>IBufferWriter&lt;byte&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>split libraries: as part of the AOT drive, the library has now been split into <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/protobuf-net" rel="nofollow"><code>protobuf-net</code></a>
and <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/protobuf-net.Core/" rel="nofollow"><code>protobuf-net.Core</code></a>, with the "Core" package having the main serializer API but none of the runtime reflection
code; this means that future AOT-only scenarios only require the "Core" package, and can omit the overhead of shipping any of the other code <em>at all</em>; you can see
this in action already at <a href="https://protogen.marcgravell.com/" rel="nofollow">protogen.marcgravell.com</a>, which uses the schema parting tools <em>and serializer core</em> in the client browser
(not at the web-server) via "Blazor"/WASM, via a dependency on <code>protobuf-net.Core</code> (a huge thanks once again to <a href="https://github.com/RemiBou">RÃ©mi BOURGAREL</a> here, who leant
their Blazor expertise)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes To Existing Features</h2>
<p>Listed in highest-to-lowest impact; the first 2 here could well be reasons <em>not</em> to choose v3 for now</p>
<ul>
<li>reference tracking <strong>is deprecated</strong>; this means any use of <code>AsReference = true</code>, to build an object <em>graph</em> rather than an object <em>tree</em>; the reality is: protobuf itself is a tree serializer, and this feature was painful
to use and support; I'm <em>open</em> to discussions around reinstating it, but it is a <em>lot</em> of work, and is a very niche feature that provides a lot of headaches</li>
<li>dynamic typing <strong>is deprecated</strong>; this means any usage of <code>DynamicType = true</code>, where a property is typed as <code>object</code>, and the serializer includes the type metadata in the payload; this feature suffers from a number of
the <a href="https://blog.marcgravell.com/2020/03/why-do-i-rag-on-binaryformatter.html" rel="nofollow">same problems as BinaryFormatter</a>, exacerbated by problems due to types moving around between .NET Framework and .NET Core; this made it both brittle and
dangerous, in addition to just being <em>terrible</em> for cross-platform work; the plan here is to implement support for the <code>Any</code> feature of protobuf, which should provide a
supportable API, while also allowing compatibility with other protobuf implementations; this work is planned for a future v3 stage, and will be back-ported to v2 to allow a migration route between v2 and v3</li>
<li>enum maps <strong>are deprecated</strong>; this is where an <code>enum</code> has a <code>[ProtoEnum(Value=...)]</code> marker that was used to provide a <strong>different</strong> value for serialization - for example, when the enum value is <code>42</code> but you want to serialize it as <code>3</code>;
this feature just confused a lot of people and made code brittle; instead, it is suggested to use a shadow property <strong>in your code</strong> that provides this map, for example via a <code>switch</code> expression, and serialize the shadow property instead</li>
<li><code>ProtoReader</code>/<code>ProtoWriter</code> must now be instantiated via <code>ProtoReader.Create</code>, not <code>new</code> (recent v2 releases have been advising this change for some time); most users will not be using these APIs</li>
<li>minor: <code>ProtoReader</code>/<code>ProtoWriter</code> <em>should</em> now be used with the <code>ref state</code> APIs when used against <code>Stream</code>, and <em>must</em> now be used with the <code>ref state</code> APIs when used against the new buffer APIs; most users will not be using these APIs</li>
<li>minor: <code>DataFormat.WellKnown</code> now advises you to use <code>CompatibilityLevel</code> instead; if you're happy with your code "as is", you can safely igore this warning (<code>#pragma</code> or similar),
and your code will continue to work in <code>Level240</code> (as <a href="https://protobuf-net.github.io/protobuf-net/compatibilitylevel" rel="nofollow">discussed here</a>)</li>
<li>minor: the API for creating runtime type models has moved from <code>TypeModel.Create</code> to <code>RuntimeTypeModel.Create</code>; this is largely a side-effect of the library split, and recent
v2 releases have been advising this change for some time; if this causes genuine inconvenience to anyone, we can probably "fix" this - just ping me!</li>
<li>streamlined framework targets; we used to have targets for (takes a deep breath): .NET Framework 2.0/3.5/4.0, .NET Standard 1.0/1.3/2.0, UAP 10.0, and .NET Core 2.1; carrying around this weight made feature changes hard bordering on
impossible, and in reality: I wasn't happy that we were providing suitable testing for platforms that <em>we haven't used in years</em>; the TFM list is now .NET Standard 2.0/2.1, and .NET Framework 4.6.1; for more discussion on this theme,
<a href="https://blog.marcgravell.com/2020/01/net-core-net-5-exodus-of-net-framework.html" rel="nofollow">see my writing here</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Emphasis: for most people, this should be a simple upgrade that "just works". It has been in use at Stack Overflow for a very long time, without any problems - providing new performance and features. If you are using the reference tracking
or dynamic type features, or .NET Framework 3.0, then I totally get that you might be frustrated here. The good news is that <em>nobody is coming to uninstall v2 from your system</em> - it will continue to work just fine.</p>
<p>As always, this library is provided "as is" etc, but if you have any problems or find any bugs, please <a href="https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net/issues">let me know</a> and we'll try to fix it.</p>
