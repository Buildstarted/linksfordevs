<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Visual Studio Code is my Rust editor of choice. Unfortunately it can't <i>quite</i> debug Rust out of the box.</p>

            <p>Configuring the debugger isn't hard. But there are a few steps. I've gone through them several times now. I'm writing this guide to save future me from having to remember them.</p>
            
            <p>Hopefully this guide is useful to a few other folks as well.</p>
                
            
            
            <p>This should go without saying.</p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">Install Rust</a><br>
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Install Visual Studio Code</a>
            </p>

            
            
            <p>You'll need to install an extension. Which one depends on your platform.</p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools">C/C++ (Windows)</a><br>
                <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb">CodeLLDB (OS X / Linux)</a><br>
            </p>
            <p>It probably makes sense to go ahead and install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust">Rust extension</a> as well.</p>

            
            
            <p>Now that your tools are installed you need to configure your VS Code launch properties.</p>
            
            <p>Click Debug -&gt; Add Configuration<br>
            If you're on Windows then select <code>C++ (Windows)</code><br>
            If you're on Mac or Linux then select <code>LLDB: Custom Launch</code></p>

            <p>This should create and open <code>launch.json</code>. You'll have to manually change the executable name under "program".</p>

<pre>{
    <span>"version"</span>: <span>"0.2.0"</span>,
    <span>"configurations"</span>: [
        {
            <span>"name"</span>: <span>"(Windows) Launch"</span>,
            <span>"type"</span>: <span>"cppvsdbg"</span>,
            <span>"request"</span>: <span>"launch"</span>,

            <span>"stopAtEntry"</span>: <span>false</span>,
            <span>"cwd"</span>: <span>"${workspaceRoot}"</span>,
            <span>"environment"</span>: [],
            <span>"externalConsole"</span>: <span>true</span>
        },
        {
            <span>"name"</span>: <span>"(OSX) Launch"</span>,
            <span>"type"</span>: <span>"lldb"</span>,
            <span>"request"</span>: <span>"launch"</span>,
            <span>"program"</span>: <span>"${workspaceRoot}/target/debug/foo"</span>,
            <span>"args"</span>: [],
            <span>"cwd"</span>: <span>"${workspaceRoot}"</span>,
        }
    ]
}
</pre>

            <p>Next, you should verify breakpoints are enabled. Some readers have reporting needing to this do. Some machines have it enabled by default. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

            <p>That's it!</p>

            <p>Add a breakpoint. Press F5 to launch. Voila!</p>

            
            
            <p>Debugging Rust works <i>pretty</i> well. It's not perfect. But it's pretty good!</p>
            <p>Basic types work fine. Assuming they aren't optimized away by the compiler, of course.</p>
            <p><img src="https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/how-to-debug-rust-with-visual-studio-code/assets/img/02.png" alt="Basic Types"></p><p>I've found the Rust compiler to be a little more aggressive than C++ when it comes to optimizing away "unused" variables. Sometimes I store intermediate values in variables just for the debugger. Their absence can be mildly annoying.</p>

            <p><code>Vectors</code> work just fine. Thankfully. I wish the unexpanded "preview" was more informative.</p>
            <p><img src="https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/how-to-debug-rust-with-visual-studio-code/assets/img/03.png" alt="Basic Types"></p><p>Unfortunately other containers don't work at all. <code>HashMap</code> is indecipherable crap. :(</p>
            <p><img src="https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/how-to-debug-rust-with-visual-studio-code/assets/img/04.png" alt="HashMap"></p><p>Visual Studio 2017 has <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/create-custom-views-of-native-objects?view=vs-2017">natvis</a> for C++. It's not great. I have a lot of complaints. It's way better than Rust's nothing.</p>

            <p><img src="https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/how-to-debug-rust-with-visual-studio-code/assets/img/06.png" alt="VisualStudio2017"></p>
            
            <p>While working on this post I learned something new. I'm somewhat blown away and want to share it.</p>
            <p>I was experimenting with the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/microprofile">microprofile</a> library. It wasn't behaving quite like I expected so I stepped into the debugger. Much to my surprise I was able to seamlessly step into the crate's Rust code. But what really shocked me is I could also step right into it's underlying C++ code!</p>
        </div><div>
            <p>All of this "just works". No additional configuration needed. You don't have to manuall specify include paths.</p>
            <p>This is awesome! You can easily step-into crate dependencies. If the crate relies on C++ code then you can debug that too.</p>
            <p>I had no idea it was this easy. What a delightful surprise!</p>

            
            
            <p>I've put together a small sample project with <code>launch.json</code> pre-configured. This should "just work".</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Run <code>cargo build</code></li>
                <li>Open <code>.vscode/ws.code-workspace</code></li>
                <li>Add a breakpoint</li>
                <li>Select your debug launch config</li>
                <li>Press F5</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I love debuggers. Using VS Code to debug Rust isn't perfect, but it's pretty good. This guide should have everything you need to get started.</p>
            <p>This should work on any platform. However I've only tested Windows and OS X. If I'm missing a step or the process changes please let me know.</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
