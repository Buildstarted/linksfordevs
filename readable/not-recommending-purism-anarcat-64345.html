            <p>This is just a quick note to mention that I have updated my <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4">hardware
documentation on the Librem 13v4 laptop</a>. It has unfortunately
turned into a rather lengthy (and ranty) piece about Purism. Let's
just say that waiting weeks for your replacement laptop (yes, it died
again) does wonders for creativity. To quote the full review:</p>

<blockquote><p>TL;DR: I recommend people avoid the Purism brand and products. I
find they have questionable politics, operate in a "libre-washing"
fashion, and produce unreliable hardware. Will not buy again.</p></blockquote>

<p>People who have read the article might want to jump directly to the
new sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#libre-washing">Libre washing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#bullshit-anti-interdiction">Bullshit anti-interdiction</a></li>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#bullshit-crowdfunding">Bullshit crowdfunding</a></li>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#hardware-reliability">Hardware reliability</a> (or lack thereof)</li>
</ul>


<p>I have also added the minor section of the <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#no-mic-jack">missing mic jack</a>.</p>

<p>I realize that some folks (particularly at Debian) might still work at
Purism, and that this article might be demoralizing for their work. If
that is the case, I am sorry this article triggered you in any way and
I hope this can act as a disclaimer. But I feel it is my duty to
document the issues I am going through, as a user, and to call
bullshit when I see it (let's face it, the anti-interdiction stuff and
the Purism 5 crowd-funding campaign were total bullshit).</p>

<p>I also understand that the pandemic makes life hard for everyone, and
probably makes a bad situation at Purism worse. But those problems
existed before the pandemic happened. They were issues I had
identified in 2019 and that I simply never got around to document.</p>

<p>I wish that people wishing to support the free software movement would
spend their energy towards organisations that actually do honest work
in that direction, like <a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a> and <a href="https://www.pine64.org/">Pine64</a>. And if you're
going to go crazy with an experimental free hardware design, why not
go retro with the <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/reform">MNT Reform</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you're looking for a phone, I recommend you give
the <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/">Fairphone</a> a fair chance. It really is a "fair" (as in, not
the best, but okay) phone that you can moderately liberate, and it
actually frigging works. See also my <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/phone/fairphone2">hardware review of the FP2</a>.</p>

<p>Update: this kind of blew up, for my standards: 10k visitors in ~24h
while I usually get about 1k visitors after a week on any regular blog
post. There were more discussions on the subject here:</p>
