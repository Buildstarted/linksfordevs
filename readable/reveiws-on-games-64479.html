            Hi, my name is Ari Hunt, I am 10 years old.This is my website about my thoughts on some of my favourite video games!
        </p>
        <h2>Call of Duty ghosts.(COD) </h2>
        <p>
            Call of duty is one of my favourite COD games because of one thing: The campaign. It is a really interesting storyline about a war with ghost vs federation. 
            I like it because it has lots of action and you get to drive differant vechiles like planes and tanks. I would definetalty recomend it to other people Who like COD. 
        </p>
        <h2>Call Of Duty black ops 4. </h2>
        <p>
            COD black ops 4 is my second favourite COD game.It has variaty of differant characters, each have differant abilities.it has  lots of really cool maps and guns.
        </p>
        <h2>Forza Horizon </h2>
        <p>
            Forza horizon is a great racing racing game with cool cars and great areas to explore.But it gets a bit boring after you have compeated in all the races.
        </p>
        <h2>Fortnite</h2>
        <p>
            Fortnite is a battle royal game where you have to be the last person standing. It is fun and all, but you die so quickly to other players that are a lot better than you.
            Other than that, it is a really fun game. 
        </p>
        <h2>Overcooked</h2>
        <p>
            Overcooked is a two player cooking game where you have to work your way through differant levels that contain differant types of food.
            It is really fun to play with family and  friends.
        </p> 
        <h2>Apex Legends</h2>
        <p>Apex legends is a lot like fotnite, but it is more realistic.it is also a battle royal game.
           You can choose between each legend who each have their own special abilitys.
        </p>
