Visual Studio may not perform as expected if your project is targeting an earlier version of .NET Core.</p><p>In .NET Core 3.1 a few outdated Windows Forms controls (<code>DataGrid</code>, <code>ToolBar</code>, <code>ContextMenu</code>, <code>Menu</code>, <code>MainMenu</code>, <code>MenuItem</code>, and their child components) were removed. These controls were replaced with newer and more powerful ones in .NET Framework 2.0 in 2005 and haven‚Äôt been available by default in the designer Toolbox. Moving forward with .NET Core, we had to cut them out of the runtime as well in order to maintain support for areas like high DPI, accessibility, and reliability. For more information please see the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/">announcement blog post</a>.</p><h2>Under the hood of the new Windows Forms Core designer (or why it takes us so much time)</h2><p>We know that you‚Äôve noticed: although the Windows Forms .NET Core designer Preview has basic functionalities, it is not mature enough for providing the full Windows Forms experience and we need a little more time to get there. In this chapter we wanted to give you a glimpse into how we are implementing the designer for .NET Core and explain some of the time frames.</p><h3>The concept</h3><p>Visual Studio is based on .NET Framework. The Windows Forms Core designer however should enable users to create a visual design for <em>.NET Core</em> apps. If you‚Äôve tried to ‚Äúmix‚Äù .NET Framework and .NET Core projects, you probably know what the challenge is here: .NET Core assemblies cannot be integrated into .NET Framework projects. Because of this (and some other reasons that we don‚Äôt want to overwhelm you with), we came up with the following internal concept: whenever the .NET Core designer is started (for example, by double-clicking on a form), a second designer process starts under the hood almost independently of Visual Studio. And that process takes over the .NET Core design part, or better to say ‚Äì it‚Äôs responsible for instantiating the .NET Core based objects that are then rendered on the monitor by the .NET Core process and not the Visual Studio process.</p><p>For example, when you drag a <code>Button</code> from the Toolbox onto a form ‚Äì this action is handled by Visual Studio (<code>devenv.exe</code> process which is .NET Framework). But, once you release the mouse button to drop the <code>Button</code> on the form, all further actions (instantiating a <code>Button</code>, rendering it at a specific location, and so on) are related to .NET Core. That means .NET Framework process can no longer handle it. Instead it calls to a .NET Core process which does the job and also creates the user interface code at runtime, which lives in the <code>InitializeComponent</code> method of a <code>Form</code> or a <code>UserControl</code>. This is the same way the XAML designer works for UWP and .NET Core.</p><h3>Was there a better way?</h3><p>There was another approach we could take that would save us a lot of time. We could simply ‚Äúmap‚Äù the .NET Core objects, features, and so on to .NET Framework ones. But this approach has significant limitations. The new features, that are available only in .NET Core won‚Äôt be available in this ‚Äúmapped‚Äù designer. And we already have quite a few Core-only functionalities such as: the new <code>PlaceholderText</code> property of the <code>TextBox</code> control, the new default font, that is used in Windows Forms .NET Core. And going forward we expect more innovations coming.</p><p>That‚Äôs why we turned down that idea, and proceeded with the described above ‚Äúout-of-process approach‚Äù that handles new additions to .NET Core very well.</p><h3>This is how it works</h3><p>The Property Browser in Visual Studio is based on the .NET Framework. However, thanks to <code>TypeDescriptors</code>, we can create ‚Äúproxy objects‚Äù as a communication link between the two processes at design time to access the actual .NET Core objects in the other (.NET Core) process via inter-process communication. That way, even though the UI is still in Visual Studio and thus is .NET Framework, users will see and edit every single aspect of the Windows Forms .NET Core objects‚Äô functionality.</p><p>The downside of this approach is that it requires us to rewrite significant portions of the Framework Windows Forms designer. To do this correctly, with the performance and stability that you expect, we had to set out a significant amount of time. The XAML designer team already developed an out-of-process model for UWP XAML designer support when UWP implemented .NET Standard 2.0. They were able to share much of that architecture with WPF running against .NET Core. This gave a head-start for .NET Core WPF designer, and now it is released and ready for .NET Core developers. The Windows Forms team started working on the designer with the .NET Core 3.0 announcement. We expect to get to feature parity by May 2020, and complete the work by the end of 2020.</p><p>The Windows Forms team wants to say <strong>THANK YOU!</strong> to those who are already testing preview versions of the designer and reporting issues! We know the experience may not be stable and we appreciate your patience and your desire to help us! üôÇ</p><h2>How to report issues</h2><p>Your feedback and help are important to us!
