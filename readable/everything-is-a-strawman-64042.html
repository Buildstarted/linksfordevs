<p>There is a logical fallacy whereby, during a debate, one person misrepresents another person’s argument and then proceeds to attack that incorrect interpretation of their argument. This fallacy is known as the <em>strawman</em> logical fallacy. Instead of responding to the real argument, they build up a strawman argument to attack.</p>



<p>An obvious modern-day example relates to the movement to “defund the police”. Certain conservative commentators hear this slogan and say “You want to get rid of the police? That’s not the answer! How will we stay safe?”</p>



<p>In reality, the call to defund the police is much more nuanced and does not call for the complete removal of the police. The tactic taken by these critics exhibits the strawman fallacy because the “defund the police” argument is misrepresented and then, in that form, subsequently attacked.</p>



<p>Your political leanings may influence the way you interpret that example. If you’re conservative, you might feel defensive. If you’re liberal, you might be nodding (or shaking) your head in agreement, perhaps with some anger arising.</p>



<p>Now I’d like to ask you – Are you reading this post? </p>



<p>Or are you reading a strawman version of it?</p>



<p>Have you digested this content with an open mind about what’s to come, or have you already built a statue of exactly what you think I am saying, will say, or intend to say, and begun to respond mentally to that instead?</p>



<p>As creatures who crave simplicity and certainty, we walk around every day and rather than responding to the true situation at the present moment, we construct our own idea of what the situation is and respond to that instead.</p>



<p>It’s our way of making things manageable. We judge people by the way that they look, thinking that we know how who they are and how to interact with them. We ignore their individual humanity. People are complicated. Situations are complicated. So we create a strawman of that person or that situation, and instead of interacting with it, we interact with the strawman.</p>



<p>By creating a strawman of the world, we think we can put it in a little box and feel okay.</p>



<p>The problem is that the little box you’ve created cannot possibly contain the world.</p>



<p>The world will surprise you. It will disappoint you. And if you try to keep it in a box, you will miss out on so much beauty.</p>



<p>The next time you catch yourself inventing a story about something or someone, try blinking a few times. Open your ears. Ask yourself: “Am I really seeing what’s in front of me? Am I listening to this <em>person</em>, or am I using their words as so many bricks to stack as I please in the form of a tower to smash or a monument to worship?”</p>



<p>Ask yourself: “Am I awake?”</p>



<p>Life and situations and people are messy. But we don’t have to turn everything into a strawman. Instead of sweeping that mess under the rug, we can be like a child who rejoices to play in the dirt.</p>
