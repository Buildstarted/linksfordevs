Not only does it allow time for pondering and reflection but the change of scenery helps refresh our thoughts. The sights and sounds can be stimulating and can keep our minds occupied and away from unpleasant ideas. </p><p>To share that therapy with others, I've decided to record drives occasionally going around different places. All the videos will be uploaded on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4LZo_6WXmIXqPy2mYHrQXQ" target="_blank">my YouTube Channel</a>. Just like my ad-free blog, my channel is not monetized. I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/windingroadmagazine" target="_blank">Winding Road Magazine</a> and others to do this but unlike them I’m not focusing on the car but rather the scenescape and general driving experience.</p><p>Every few days, I'll be going through different parts of the City of Ottawa and nearby to explore the beautiful and admittedly sometimes bland scenery that this region has to offer. Ottawa is large and provides both rural and urban experiences with a combination of American and European styled-architecture. Feel free to suggest places I should drive to in the comments. </p><p>The soundscape will be provided by various environmental sounds and the music from the rumbling and purr of the Honda K20C4 engine. See the city early in the morning, in the evening and sometimes even at night. I'll make sure the experience is as engaging and interesting as possible with plenty of variety. The recording is done with a GoPro HERO8 with a head strap at 1080p60 for a clear and smooth picture. Sound is done in stereo for a more binaural feel. My car is an average family sedan, a 2019 Honda Accord Sport 2.0T with Manual Transmission. The video was edited using <a href="https://kdenlive.org/en/download/" target="_blank">KDenLive</a>. </p><p>I’m still adjusting the angle of the GoPro camera to get the optimal perspective. Sound might need some work as well. I’m quite short and that makes the view a bit awkward and high, I’ll have to find out a way to optimize the seating position to get a better picture. I’m also planning to edit out the long waits at intersections. </p><p>I recommend a listen through headphones. Set the video quality to 1080p60 for optimal viewing experience.</p><p>In each video, I’ll give a general itinerary of where we’ll be going and a short description of the features of the ride. Also linked will be a Google Maps link with the roads taken.</p><p>Please subscribe, comment and like if you enjoyed these videos.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
