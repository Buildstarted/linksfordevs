<p><strong>Raytracing</strong> is a relatively simple way to render images of 3D objects.
The core is an elegant idea, that one can simulate the real-world behavior
of photons of light bouncing off of surfaces and colors accumulating from
their paths. It's not inherently fast, but the simplicity of the core lets
it model interesting things like reflections and depth of field in ways
that mirror natural processes.</p>
<h2>CS 301: Raytracing</h2>
<p>This happens to be a popular subject for education: implementing a raytracer
requires a student to understand vector math, fast code, and even recursion.
The reward is a pretty image - more compelling than the blasé debug output
that students get from most assignments.</p>
<p>But it's still hard to learn: explanations are written either in the
language of mathematics or programming, and rarely connect all the dots.
Raytracer implementations tend to extremes: one
<a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/">fits on a business card</a>,
another <a href="http://www.povray.org/">supports nearly every potential feature</a>,
and most of the rest are <a href="https://github.com/search?q=raytracer+cs&amp;ref=cmdform">homework assignments</a>,
implemented just enough to run, never enough to have comments and documentation.</p>
<h2>Literate Raytracer</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tmcw/literate-raytracer">Literate raytracer</a> is a
simple implementation of raytracing in Javascript. It's <a href="http://macwright.org/literate-raytracer/">made to be
read as a narrative</a>, and intends
to <a href="http://macwright.org/literate-raytracer/vector.html">explain vector operations</a> as well.</p>

<p>We need to define three different kinds of things in 3D space:
a <strong>camera</strong> from which we cast rays into the scene, <strong>objects</strong>
that can be hit by those rays and are drawn into the scene, and
<strong>lights</strong> that change the color of rays, by extension coloring objects.</p>
<p>In this case, we define these objects as simple objects with vectors
defined as <code>{x, y, z}</code> objects.</p>
<h2>The Camera</h2>
<p>Our camera is pretty simple: it's a point in space, where you can imagine
that the camera 'sits', a <code>fieldOfView</code>, which is the angle from the right
to the left side of its frame, and a <code>vector</code> which determines what
angle it points in.</p>

    },
    fieldOfView: <span>45</span>,
    vector: {
        x: <span>0</span>,
        y: <span>3</span>,

shading will be affected by any visible lights.</p>

<p>This is one part where we can't follow nature exactly: technically photons
come out of lights, bounce off of objects, and then some hit the 'eye'
and many don't. Simulating this - sending rays in all directions out of
each light and most not having any real effect - would be too inefficient.</p>
<p>Luckily, the reverse is more efficient and has practically the same result -
instead of rays going 'from' lights to the eye, we follow rays from the eye
and see if they end up hitting any features and lights on their travels.</p>
<p>For each pixel in the canvas, there needs to be at least one ray of light
that determines its color by bouncing through the scene.</p>

              <p>This process
is a bit odd, because there's a disconnect between pixels and vectors:
given the left and right, top and bottom rays, the rays we shoot are just
interpolated between them in little increments.</p>
<p>Starting with the height and width of the scene, the camera's place,
direction, and field of view, we calculate factors that create
<code>width*height</code> vectors for each ray</p>
<p>Start by creating a simple vector pointing in the direction the camera is
pointing - a unit vector</p>

              <p>and then we'll rotate this by combining it with a version that's turned
90° right and one that's turned 90° up. Since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product">cross product</a>
takes two vectors and creates a third that's perpendicular to both,
we use a pure 'UP' vector to turn the camera right, and that 'right'
vector to turn the camera up.</p>
