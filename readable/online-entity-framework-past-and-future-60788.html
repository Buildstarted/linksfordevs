<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>** VIRTUAL/ONLINE Event **</p><p>For the next couple of months, Louisville .NET Meetup will be an online event. This way we can still get together, learn about awesome things about .NET development, and still practice social distancing. These events will be sponsored by Green Events &amp; Technology, who is looking to bring more events for Louisville developers to grow professionally.</p><p>We will meet on Thursday, April 16, 2020 using a Zoom meeting. “Doors” will open at 6:45 pm EDT and the presentation will begin sharply at 7:00 pm EDT. Afterwards, we’ll have a group chat to discuss the presentation or anything else the group would like to talk about.</p><p>Zoom meeting info below.</p><p>Entity Framework Past and Future</p><p>Join the Entity Framework team to learn about the solution that 3 out of 4 ASP.NET developers use for data access. The team will introduce you to EF Core, share a retrospective of version 3.0, cover key features in the EF Core 5.0 roadmap and show some demos along the way.</p><p>Jeremy Likness<br>Jeremy Likness is a Senior PM for .NET Data at Microsoft. Jeremy wrote his first program in 1982, was recognized in the "who's who in Quake" list for programming the first implementation of "Midnight Capture the Flag" in Quake C and has been developing enterprise applications for 25 years with a primary focus on web-based delivery of line of business applications. Jeremy is the author of four technology books, a former 8-year Microsoft MVP for Developer Tools and Technologies, an international and keynote speaker and writes regularly about cloud and .NET development on his developer blog (<a href="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/" title="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/" target="__blank">https://blog.jeremylikness.com/</a>). Jeremy was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease in 2020 and advocates for awareness on his personal website (<a href="https://www.strengthwithparkinsons.com/" title="https://www.strengthwithparkinsons.com" target="__blank">https://www.strengthwithparkinsons.com</a>). He follows a plant-based diet and spends most of his free time running, hiking and camping, and playing 9-ball and one pocket.</p><p>Arthur Vickers<br>Arthur Vickers has been on the Entity Framework team at Microsoft for the last 12 years. Arthur is not responsible for EF1, but did add many features to EF4, including FK, and POCO support. Arthur was one of the prime movers behind introduction of the DbContext API and Code First in EF4.1, and then pushed for the move to open-source for EF6. More recently, Arthur proposed creation of a modern, cloud and devices-focused flavor of EF, which later transformed into EF Core. In his spare time, Arthur does a lot of programming, since he is now a manager and writes bios like this at work instead of coding.</p><p>************ Zoom Meeting Info ************<br><a href="https://zoom.us/j/96310435479" title="https://zoom.us/j/96310435479" target="__blank">https://zoom.us/j/96310435479</a></p><p>Meeting ID:[masked]</p><p>One tap mobile<br>[masked],,[masked]# US (New York)<br>[masked],,[masked]# US (Chicago)</p><p>Dial by your location<br>[masked] US (New York)<br>[masked] US (Chicago)<br>[masked] US<br>[masked] US (Houston)<br>[masked] US (San Jose)<br>[masked] US</p><p>Meeting ID:[masked]</p><p>Find your local number: <a href="https://zoom.us/u/acoyIfNUx7" title="https://zoom.us/u/acoyIfNUx7" target="__blank">https://zoom.us/u/acoyIfNUx7</a></p></div></div></div></div>
