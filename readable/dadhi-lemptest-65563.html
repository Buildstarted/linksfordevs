<h2>Why at all</h2>
<p>Compile-time dependency injection here is
the generation of object-graph "service creation code" given the interface-implementation registrations provided at compile-time.
In a simplest form you may consider "service creation code" as a method returning <code>new A(new B(new C(), new C1(new D()), ...)</code>. The tool should generate this method at compile-time and make it a part of your project.</p>
<p>The idea is already implemented in my another project <a href="https://github.com/dadhi/dryioc">DryIoc</a> using the T4 templates
but has a number of <a href="https://github.com/dadhi/DryIoc/issues/212">problems</a>.</p>
<p>In this repository I want to solve these problems and test the ideas <strong>without much accent on DI itself</strong>.
Nevertheless, the DI should be a functional solution to make the test actually usable and verify the different aspects of the problem.
OK, the DryIoc supports both compile-time and runtime registrations, because it not always possible to know everything at compile-time.
Therefore this DI prototype should support this too.</p>
<p>The typical compile-time service registration will look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span>di</span>.<span>Register</span>&lt;<span>X</span>&gt;(<span>resolver</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>X</span>(<span>new</span> <span>A</span>(), <span>resolver</span>.<span>Resolve</span>&lt;<span>B</span>&gt;()));</pre></div>
<p><code>resolver.Resolver&lt;B&gt;()</code> here is the bridge to another registration which can be either compile-time or runtime-one.
You can imagine that <code>X</code> and <code>A</code> are your app services and <code>B</code> is a context or configuration provided by
the framework at runtime.</p>
<h2>Problems to solve</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I want the ability to use part of DI to help generate another part of DI at compile-time. It means that I need to reference the code (compiled) from the compile-time template to generate the remaining part of the code. But I don't want to split the first part to another library, then compile it, then load it for the rest of code-generation. So inevitably I am ending-up with the chicken-egg problem. For T4 the hack would be to compile the DI project first with the compile-time generation commented out, then uncomment the generation and load the produced dll to compile the new dll with generated code :/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to publish the DI as a code-only NuGet package with the template that's supposed to be modified by user - to put the registrations into it. I want the package to be easy (as automated as possible) consumed by modern .NET Core v3.1 applications, like ASP .NET Core MVC/WebAPI. And this combination currently is the real mess. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4837">one</a> of the many issues. You need to really <a href="http://diegogiacomelli.com.br/deploying-a-t4-template-with-dotnet-pack" rel="nofollow">hack around</a> your <a href="https://medium.com/@attilah/source-code-only-nuget-packages-8f34a8fb4738" rel="nofollow">way</a> to achieve this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that I already invested the time and created the T4 implementation in DryIoc,
it seems that I need to push it further, probably using the <a href="https://github.com/mono/t4">mono implementation</a> to support modern targets.
But T4 never felt to me like a good fit for C# because it is a different text manipulating tool tearing the C# code into disjoint parts.
The errors are cryptic. Assembly loading and references is a quiz.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So here goes...</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<h3>LeMP and ECSharp</h3>
<p>The project site <a href="http://ecsharp.net/" rel="nofollow">http://ecsharp.net/</a></p>
<p>LeMP compile-time code-generation similar to T4 is supported starting from the <a href="https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/releases/tag/v2.8.1">v2.8.1</a></p>
<p>LeMP solves the 3rd problem because its compile-time generation capabilities keep the code looking like C# with almost all valid C# syntax.
And ta-ba-dam, ta-ba-dam, ... it solves the 1st problem too via <code>compileAndRuntime {}</code> which makes code available for the compile-time tools and keeps the code in the result runtime binary.</p>
<p>Other goodies are Extended CSharp features, macros and sugar.</p>
<h3>The build</h3>
<p>The solution is supposed to be built and tested in VS Code. I did not yet tested it in Visual Studio.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download LeMP zip, unzip it to some folder and add the folder path to Environment PATH variable. Open any terminal and check that "lemp.exe --help" returns something meaningful.</li>
<li>Add the folder <code>.nupkg</code> as a local NuGet source: <code>dotnet nuget add source full\path\to\.nupkg --name Local</code></li>
<li>Go to "LempDotnetTool" project folder and compile it via <code>dotnet build</code>. This will produce the LempDotnetTool package in <code>.nupkg</code> wrapping the "LeMP.exe". It is done to simplify installing the LeMP together with the CompileTimeDI package.</li>
<li>Go back to solution folder and built it with <code>dotnet build</code></li>
<li>For <code>.ecs</code> and <code>.ecs.include</code> files you may turn-on the CSharp syntax highlighting via "Change Language Mode" command (<code>Ctrl+K,M</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>CompileTimeDI project</h3>
<p>CompileTimeDI is the .NET Standard 2.0 project with the DI implementation contained in a single <code>CompileTimeDI.ecs</code>.
The project also contains the <code>ServiceRegistrations.ecs.include</code> file which is supposed to be edited by DI user.
The latter is included into former, then everything is processed by LeMP macro processor at compile-time and the output
is stored in <code>CompileTimeDI.Generated.cs</code> file. Invoke the <code>dotnet build</code> to run the processing.</p>
<p>When build in the Release configuration <code>dotnet build -c Release</code>,
the project is packaged into the content-only NuGet package (<a href="https://medium.com/@attilah/source-code-only-nuget-packages-8f34a8fb4738" rel="nofollow">yes, you can do this</a>)
and can be found in the ".nupkg" folder.</p>
<h3>AspNetCoreSample project</h3>
<p>AspNetCoreSample is the standard ASP .NET Core v3.1 WebApi dotnet template app consuming the CompileTimeDI package.
It installs the "CompileTimeDI" package from the Local feed (together with LempDotnetTool) and
specifies some test service registrations from the AnotherLib project. **No need for a manual file copying and the prolonged user instructions".
Start the app from the project folder via <code>dotnet run</code>.
Go to the listed <code>localhost:port/services</code> in web browser to see the results.
The compile-time registrations are in <code>ServiceRegistrations.ecs.include</code> and the remaing parts are in <code>WeatherForcastController</code>.</p>
