<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://arunoda.me/lighthouse-syndrome/very-bad-app-lighthouse-score.png" width="100%"></p><p>See. I got a 100% score on Lighthouse.</p></div></div><div><p>This is not a rant about Lighthouse. But it is about how we use that tool.<br>Keep reading my friend.</p></div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a> is a tool that comes with Chrome, which we often use to analyze a website for performance, SEO, best practices, etc. Recently, I discover a trend among developers who want to get the top score for their websites. Or they expect websites to have a 100% score.</p><p>So, I want to understand whether it's a good idea to optimize our apps for Lighthouse or not. Then I ran Lighthouse on a set of popular websites I use every day. Here's the result.</p><h3>Google</h3><div><p><img src="https://arunoda.me/lighthouse-syndrome/google-lighthouse-score.png" width="100%"></p></div><h3>Reddit</h3><div><p><img src="https://arunoda.me/lighthouse-syndrome/reddit-lighthouse-score.png" width="100%"></p></div><h3>Hacker News</h3><div><p><img src="https://arunoda.me/lighthouse-syndrome/hackernews-lighthouse-score.png" width="100%"></p></div><h3>Twitter</h3><div><p><img src="https://arunoda.me/lighthouse-syndrome/twitter-lighthouse-score.png" width="100%"></p></div><p>If you look at those results, they are pretty bad. But as an end-user, I really enjoy using those websites. Don't you?</p><p>Then I tried to create a pretty unusable website, which took 100% on Lighthouse. Wow.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://arunoda.me/lighthouse-syndrome/very-bad-app-lighthouse-score.png" width="100%"></p></div></div><div><p>So then, what's that score means?</p></div><h2>Lighthouse is a "Vanity Metric"</h2><p>Lighthouse score does not mean anything about the user experience of the web app or how it performs. It's just another metric.</p><p><strong>Here's what we should try to do instead:</strong></p><p>If you are interested in the product, maybe focus on your Key Performance Indicators(KPI) like monthly recurring revenue(MRR) or daily active users.<br>(I found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL6GdUHIBsM">this Startup School video</a> very helpful.)</p><p>Otherwise, try to optimize your app for faster interaction and navigations. A framework like Next.js will help you get things done automatically. Still, there are some things you have to do.</p><div><div><div><p>I'm working on a set of tutorials related to these optimizations. If you like to preview them, <a target="_blank" href="https://buttondown.email/arunoda?special=1">subscribe</a> to my Newsletter.</p></div></div></div><p>If you want to go further, try to create an end-to-end test suite using a service like Checkly and monitor for broken user interactions.<br>(rauchg wrote an <a target="_blank" href="https://rauchg.com/2020/develop-preview-test">insightful article</a> related to this topic.)</p><h2>Okay. Should we stop using Lighthouse?</h2><p>Nope. It's a useful tool in our dev toolbox. It shows insight into various problems and shows you how you can fix them.</p><p>Try to run Lighthouse from time to time. If you find out any issues, create tasks to fix them, and prioritize them.</p><blockquote><p>I ran Lighthouse today for a new project I'm working on.<br>Here's how I deal with it.</p></blockquote><p>It shows me a bunch of issues, and there's a one issue related to accessibility. The fix is a tiny CSS change, but the improvement is massive. So, I fixed it right away.</p><p>There were some other issues. I created a task to run Lighthouse next week.</p><div><p>If you got upset by the title, I'm really sorry. But I honestly think this is the reality.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
