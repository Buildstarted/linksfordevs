This session is packed with practical examples and demos of where the latest high-performance APIs and language features can be applied in your applications.</p><p>During this session, we'll apply types such as Span and Memory to efficiently process data and to parse strings. We'll examine System.IO.Pipelines, offering high-performance I/O and we'll utilize ArrayPool to help reduce GC allocations. In .NET Core 3.0, we have new high-performance JSON APIs which we'll also add to our arsenal. Microsoft has made fantastic performance gains to the .NET Core framework; now it's time to apply them to your code!</p><p>We'll begin by discussing when and why performance matters in your applications. You'll learn how to measure your code, and use a data-driven approach to focus your optimizations.</p><p>These features can seem complicated, unapproachable and difficult to apply. In this session, Steve introduces high-performance newcomers to the features, showing you how they work, where they can be applied and how to measure performance improvements in your code.</p><p>This talk is for developers, who like Steve, are ready to begin their journey towards writing faster .NET code, which allocates less.</p><p>This talk is aimed at all levels of .NET Core developers. It's intended to provide a real-world experience of applying high-performance techniques to .NET code. It shares the journey and experience of a relative performance novice, learning about these features for the first time to solve real problems and optimize code. The audience will leave this talk with the knowledge to begin leveraging performance features and inspired to try them in their code.</p><p>Steve Gordon<br>Microsoft MVP and Senior Software Developer at Madgex Ltd</p><p>Steve Gordon is a Pluralsight author, Microsoft MVP, senior developer and community lead, based in Brighton, UK. He works for Madgex developing and supporting their new product portfolio built on ASP.NET Core technologies. Steve is passionate about community and all things .NET related, having worked with ASP.NET on and off for over 15 years.</p><p>Steve is currently developing microservice-based systems and services, using .NET Core and Docker. He enjoys sharing his knowledge through his blog, in videos and by presenting talks at user groups and conferences. Steve is excited to be a part of the .NET community and founded .NET South East, a .NET Meetup group based in Brighton. He enjoys contributing to and maintaining OSS projects.
