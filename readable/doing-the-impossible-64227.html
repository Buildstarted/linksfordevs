<blockquote><p>All things which are proved to be impossible must obviously rest on some assumptions, and when one or more of these assumptions are not true then the impossibility proof fails—but the expert seldom remembers to carefully inspect the assumptions before making their “impossible” statements. </p><cite>Richard Hamming, <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Hamming-TheArtOfDoingScienceAndEngineering.pdf">You and Your Research (1986)</a>, p182</cite></blockquote>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">We’re all familiar with the <a href="https://www.xaprb.com/blog/flight-is-impossible/">many dignitaries, including Kelvin and Edison</a>, who declared heavier-than-air flying machines were impossible just a few years prior to the Wright brothers’ success at Kitty Hawk. In the field of nuclear fusion, there’s been a tendency recently to<a href="https://www.typeoneenergy.com/"> make references</a> or <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/84-million-cash-commonwealth-fusion-011407386.html">analogies </a>to Kitty Hawk. The question arises: is fusion at a Wright brothers moment, or a Da Vinci moment? (Da Vinci’s ideas for flight were ahead of their time — the Wright brothers’ were punctual.) </p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">Rather than speculating on the future, here are a few examples of failed impossibility proofs related to nuclear fusion. I’ll tie it all together at the end with some further thoughts about the value of impossibility proofs as pointers to solutions. </p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">Although it may not seem like it, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu1jEWLZVug">levitron magnetic top</a> is quite relevant. The levitron consists of a small spinning ceramic magnet hovering above a larger one. There are no strings, no superconductors, and no electronics involved. According to Earnshaw’s theorem, static levitation using only permanent magnets is impossible. The inventor of the levitron, Roy Harrigan, was told by physicists that what he was trying to do was impossible — just another perpetual motion machine. Harrigan persisted, and eventually perfected the device.  This is remarkable, because the levitron requires careful tuning — a great deal of patience must have been required. Once Harrigan demonstrated his invention, physicists were able to explain it: Earnshaw’s theorem is correct, but it only applies to <em>static</em> magnets — the levitron is actually in an <em>orbit</em>.  (Source: <a href="http://www.physics.ucla.edu/marty/levitron/spinstab.pdf">Spin stabilized magnetic levitation</a>, by Martin, Helfinger, &amp; Ridgway, <em>Am. J. Phys.</em><strong> 65</strong>, 4, 1997)</p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">There’s a close analogy between the levitron and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-reversed_configuration">field-reversed configuration</a> (FRC) concept for nuclear fusion. Both the FRC and the levitron can be thought of as magnetic dipoles oriented the ‘wrong way’ in an external magnetic field.  If it weren’t for rotation, the dipole would flip end-over-end to align with the external field. (In the FRC, the rotation in question is in the form of individual particles with orbits that are roughly the same diameter as plasma itself.) The FRC has several advantages over the tokamak.  For instance, for a given external magnetic field strength, the FRC can support approximately 10 times the plasma pressure, leading to 100 times the fusion power density. <a href="https://tae.com/">TAE Technologies</a> (my current employer) is pursuing this concept, as are others (such as <a href="https://www.helionenergy.com/">Helion Energy</a> and <a href="https://www.compactfusionsystems.com/">Compact Fusion Systems</a>).  </p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">Here’s another example where a <em>static</em> plasma is unstable, but a moving one is stabilized: the shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch, pursued by <a href="https://www.zapenergyinc.com/">Zap Energy</a>. The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-pinch"> Z-pinch</a> is literally the textbook example of an unstable plasma configuration, because it is very simple to analyze, and it was one of the first attempted configurations for a nuclear fusion reactor. It has the advantage of not requiring external magnetic field coils — the magnetic field is generated by a current flowing through the plasma itself.  The caveat is that the plasma must be in direct contact with electrodes at both ends which create the current — this is bad news for both the plasma and the electrodes! (Side note / self-promotion: the physics of the shear-flow Z-pinch is very similar to a phenomenon I discovered – <a href="https://wiki.physics.wisc.edu/garage/Bubble%20Stability">flow stabilization of a cylindrical soap bubble</a>. You can try this one at home.)</p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">The violation of <strong>seemingly-innocuous assumptions</strong> is what links these examples.<strong> </strong>Earnshaw’s theorem assumes <em>static</em> levitation. The theorem is true — it just doesn’t apply to the levitron. Similarly, the ‘proof’ of instability of the FRC assumes that particle orbits are very small — a good assumption in other magnetic confinement configurations, but not for the lower magnetic fields involved in the FRC approach. In the case of the Z-pinch, the static plasma assumption seemed reasonable — the stabilizing effect of sheared flow was not appreciated for many years, so static plasma assumptions appeared to simply make the math easier. </p>



<blockquote><p>…what is proved, by impossibility proofs, is lack of imagination.</p><cite>J. S. Bell, <a href="https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/bell/Impossible_Pilot_Wave.pdf">On the Impossible Pilot Wave</a>, <span>Ref.TH.3315-CERN</span> (1982)</cite></blockquote>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">Can we turn Hamming’s insight into a recipe for achieving the impossible? Bell’s quip gets to the heart of the problem: recognizing which assumptions to break, and in what manner, requires creativity, imagination, and perhaps intuition and luck as well. Not every assumption is critical, in that violating it will yield a solution. Also, there may be many <em>ways</em> in which an assumption could be violated or modified — not all of them productive. The productive paths are not always obvious, either. There’s also the question of which assumptions <em>can</em> be violated, practically-speaking.</p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">Impossibility proofs are not without value — they rule out certain areas of search space, which can save time and effort exploring fruitless avenues.  Assumptions simplify reasoning by removing variables — we can’t always work from first principles. Removing assumptions makes reasoning and calculations more difficult, so it’s important to be selective about which ones to remove.  A useful impossibility proof is one whose assumptions are few, explicit, and necessary for the conclusion (that is, without the assumption a solution would become possible).  </p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Returning to fusion energy</strong>: Lawrence Lidsky, former director of the MIT fusion research program, spelled out an ‘<a href="http://orcutt.net/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Trouble-With-Fusion_MIT_Tech_Review_1983.pdf">impossibility proof</a>‘ for economically-competitive fusion energy in 1983. In a nutshell, Lidsky argues that fusion devices using the conventional deuterium-tritium fuel won’t be economically competitive with nuclear fission. For both fusion and fission, the dominant contribution to the cost of electricity is the cost of capital — the fuel costs are small, due to the enormous energy density of the fuel. On the other hand, fusion reactors will have lower<em> power density </em>(by 10 or 100 times) compared to fission, so they will be proportionately larger than an equivalent fission reactor core. Fusion reactors are also more complicated technology. Fusion reactions also cause more neutron damage to solid materials, requiring frequent maintenance. Therefore, fusion will be more expensive than fission — which is already not very economically competitive. </p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">Lidsky’s critique of fusion has a large number of assumptions, some of them implicit, and not all of them necessary — in other words, it could be improved. I’m working on a series of posts addressing his assumptions, to see what <em>can</em> be learned from the arguments. My next post will be a look at contemporary energy economics, followed by consideration of how to achieve high power density in a fusion reactor. </p>
