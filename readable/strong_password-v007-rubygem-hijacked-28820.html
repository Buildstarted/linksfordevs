            <p>I recently updated minor and patch versions of the gems our Rails app uses. We
want to keep dependencies fresh, bugs fixed, security vulnerabilities addressed
while maintaining a high chance of backward compatibility with our codebase. In
all, it was 25 gems we’d upgrade.</p>

<p>I went line by line linking to each library’s changeset. <strong>This due diligence
never reported significant surprises to me, until this time</strong>.  Most
gems have a <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> file that describes the changes in each version. Some
do not, and I had to compare by git tags or commits list (like cocoon or bcrypt
gems). The <code>jquery-rails</code> upgrade contains a <code>jQuery.js</code> upgrade, so the related
log was in another project.</p>

<p><strong>And I couldn’t find the changes for <code>strong_password</code></strong>. It appeared to have
gone from 0.0.6 to 0.0.7, yet the last change in any branch in GitHub was from 6
months ago, and we were up to date with those. If there was new code, it existed
only in <code>RubyGems.org</code>.</p>

<p>I downloaded the gem from RubyGems and compared its contents with the latest
copy in GitHub. At the end of <code>lib/strong_password/strength_checker.rb</code> version
0.0.7 there was the following:</p>

<p>I checked who published it and it was an almost empty account, with a different
name than the maintainer’s, with access only to this gem. I checked the
maintainer’s email in GitHub and wrote to him with the prettified version of the
diff:</p>

<p>In a loop within a new thread, after waiting for a random number of seconds up
to about an hour, it fetches and runs the code stored in a <code>pastebin.com</code>, only if
running in production, with an empty exception handler that ignores any error
it may raise.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes, Brian McManus wrote back:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The gem seems to have been pulled out from under me… When I login to
rubygems.org I don’t seem to have ownership now. Bogus 0.0.7 release was
created 6/25/2019.</p>

<p>In case the Pastebin got deleted or changed, I emailed the Pastebin that was up
on June 28th at 8 PM UTC, carbon-copying Ruby on Rails’ security coordinator,

<p>While waiting for their answers, I tried to understand the code. If it didn’t
run before (checking for the existence of the <code>Z1</code> dummy constant) it injects a
middleware that <code>eval</code>‘s cookies named with an <code>___id</code> suffix, only in
production, all surrounded by the empty exception handler <code>_!</code> function that’s
defined in the hijacked gem, opening the door to <strong>silently executing remote
code in production at the attacker’s will</strong>.</p>

<p>It also sends a request to a controlled domain with an HTTP header informing the
infected host URLs. It depends on the Faraday gem being loaded for the
notification to work (which the <code>oauth2</code> and <code>stripe</code> gems, for example,
include).</p>

<p>Rafael França replied in 25 minutes, adding <code>security@rubygems.org</code> to the thread.
Someone at RubyGems quickly yanked it, and the next day André Arko confirmed he
had yanked it, locked the <code>kickball</code> RubyGems account, and added Brian back to
the gem.</p>

<p>I asked for a CVE identifier (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) to
<code>cve-request@mitre.org</code>, and they assigned CVE-2019-13354, which I used to announce
the potential issue in production installations to the <a href="https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db">rubysec/ruby-advisory-db</a>
project and the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ruby-security-ann">ruby-security-ann Google Group</a>.</p>

<p>EDIT (July 8th): the author <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20382779">explained how he thinks his account was taken
over</a>. He had his RubyGems
account for long enough that 2-factor-auth wasn’t even an option, back then he
didn’t have unique passwords in different websites, and since then many services
got breached, and attackers might have guessed his credentials. <strong>Use password
managers! Rotate weak passwords and activate 2FA wherever it matters</strong>.</p>
