<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>If you’re interested in building your own <a href="https://eater.net/6502">6502 computer</a>, I provide a kit that includes all of the components used in my 6502 video series.</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> In addition to the base kit, you will need:</p><ul><li>A 5-volt power supply</li><li>An EEPROM programmer</li></ul><p>Also, if you want to follow all of the experiments and debugging in the videos, I recommend the clock module kit and an Arduino Mega. The clock module kit also happens to include a 5-volt power supply.</p><p>If you’re interested in following along with my <a href="https://eater.net/8bit"> 8-bit breadboard computer videos</a> and building your own, I’ve assembled kits that include all of the components I used in the videos, including the Arduino EEPROM programmer and a 5 volt power supply. It’s a challenging but extremely rewarding project.</p><p>I broke the whole thing into four kits if you want to take things slow. But you can save $20 by buying the complete bundle:</p><p>If you’d like to start without committing to the entire project, you can also just get the individual kits:</p><p>All of these kits include the high quality breadboards and other components that I use in the videos. I’ve found that high quality breadboards are important for such a large project with many connections. Hunting down flaky loose connections is no fun.</p><h2>Tools required</h2><p>In addition to what comes with the kits, you’ll need a few common tools. For kit 1, to connect the power supply, you need:</p><ul><li>A small (#1) phillips screwdriver.</li></ul><p>For the remainder of the kits (2, 3, and 4) you'll also need:</p><ul><li>Wire cutters, preferably small ones. (e.g., these from <a to="https://amzn.to/2AFP3Nm" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2AFP3Nm">Hakko</a> or <a to="https://amzn.to/2CdflX8" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2CdflX8">Lindstrom</a>).</li><li>Small needle-nose pliers or good tweezers; I prefer smooth-jaw needle-nose pliers. (e.g., these from <a to="https://amzn.to/2RLfz1o" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2RLfz1o">Hakko</a> or <a to="https://amzn.to/2M4P3Lk" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2M4P3Lk">Lindstrom</a>).</li><li>Wire stripper that works for 22AWG wire. (e.g., these from <a to="https://amzn.to/2D4IxkC" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2D4IxkC">Hakko</a> or I really like this <a to="https://amzn.to/2M4hqco" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2M4hqco">simple kind from Ideal</a>).</li><li>Box cutter, X-ACTO, or other small knife to separate the power rails from the breadboards.</li></ul><p>I also highly recommend having some sort of basic multimeter. I hear the <a to="https://amzn.to/2REXCSl" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2REXCSl">ANENG AN8008</a> is a good value, though you can spend as much or as little as you want on a multimeter and most will do the job just fine.</p><p>Finally, you’ll probably want something to build the computer on so it’s easy to pick the whole thing up and move it. I used a simple piece of <a to="https://amzn.to/2SPXLQa" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SPXLQa">foam board </a>(buy it locally). But you can be creative and use whatever you have.</p><p><span>No soldering is required! </span>There are several minor points in the videos where I do some soldering, but in all cases it’s not required. Alternative approaches are shown on this website.</p><h2>Completely optional</h2><p>Some people find a <a to="https://amzn.to/2H9oIwR" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2H9oIwR">logic probe</a> to be really handy, though with the number of LEDs on the computer, most things you’ll want to probe will already be visible. Some people also find an <a to="https://amzn.to/2FpxkN8" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2FpxkN8">oscilloscope</a> (even one of <a to="https://amzn.to/2J6szK4" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2J6szK4">these toy ones</a>) useful, though I really don’t think it’s necessary at all. I use an oscilloscope in a couple videos to demo a few things, but watching those demos is all you need. The computer itself runs slow enough that you can probably troubleshoot everything using a multimeter or even just using the LEDs and some persistence.</p><h2>The fine print</h2><p>If you have questions about an order, payment, or shipping, please contact <a href="mailto:support@eater.net">support@eater.net</a> and include your order number. For technical help assembling or troubleshooting the kits, please post a question at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beneater/">reddit.com/r/beneater</a> since it’s difficult for me to answer these individually. I do try to stay active there.</p><p><strong>Non-US customers:</strong> Note that all kits ship from California. I’m willing to ship a box anywhere you want, but the buyer—that’s you—is responsible for any applicable import duties and local taxes. In some cases, the carrier (FedEx or UPS) may charge a fee to collect these taxes from you. Please verify with your customs and taxing authorities before making a purchase to understand what else you may be required to pay.</p><p>Finally, the power supply in kit 1 has a North American style plug. It will work worldwide because it supports 100-240 volts, but if your country uses a different type of electrical outlet, you will need to provide a plug adapter (e.g., something like <a to="https://amzn.to/2M3FHiI" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2M3FHiI">this</a>).</p></div></div></div></div>
