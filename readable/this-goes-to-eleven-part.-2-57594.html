        <p>Since there‚Äôs a lot to over go over here, I‚Äôve split it up into no less than 6 parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In <a href="https://bits.houmus.org/2020-01-28/this-goes-to-eleven-pt1">part 1</a>, we start with a refresher on <code>QuickSort</code> and how it compares to <code>Array.Sort()</code>.</li>
  <li>In this part, we go over the basics of vectorized hardware intrinsics, vector types, and go over a handful of vectorized instructions we‚Äôll use in part 3. We still won‚Äôt be sorting anything.</li>
  <li>In <a href="https://bits.houmus.org/2020-01-30/this-goes-to-eleven-pt3">part 3</a>, we go through the initial code for the vectorized sorting, and we‚Äôll start seeing some payoff. We finish agonizing courtesy of the CPU‚Äôs Branch Predictor, throwing a wrench into our attempts.</li>
  <li>In part 4, we go over a handful of optimization approaches that I attempted trying to get the vectorized partitioning to run faster. We‚Äôll see what worked and what didn‚Äôt.</li>
  <li>In part 5, we‚Äôll see how we can almost get rid of all the remaining scalar code- by implementing small-constant size array sorting. We‚Äôll use, drum roll‚Ä¶, yet more AVX2 vectorization.</li>
  <li>Finally, in part 6, I‚Äôll list the outstanding stuff/ideas I have for getting more juice and functionality out of my vectorized code.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="intrinsics--vectorization">Intrinsics / Vectorization</h2>

<p>I‚Äôll start by repeating my own words from the first <a href="https://bits.houmus.org/2018-08-18/netcoreapp3.0-intrinsics-in-real-life-pt1#the-whatwhy-of-intrinsics">blog post where I discussed intrinsics</a> in the CoreCLR 3.0 alpha days:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Processor intrinsics are a way to directly embed specific CPU instructions via special, fake method calls that the JIT replaces at code-generation time. Many of these instructions are considered exotic, and normal language syntax does cannot map them cleanly.<br>
The general rule is that a single intrinsic ‚Äúfunction‚Äù becomes a single CPU instruction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can go and re-read that introduction if you care for a more general and gentle introduction to processor intrinsics. For this series, we are going to focus on vectorized intrinsics in Intel processors. This is the largest group of CPU specific intrinsics in our processors, and I want to start by showing this by the numbers. I gathered some statistics by processing Intel‚Äôs own <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/files/data-3.4.6.xml">data-3.4.6.xml</a>. This XML file is part of the <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/">Intel Intrinsics Guide</a>, an invaluable resource on intrinsics in itself, and the ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù behind the guide. What I learned was that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are no less than 1,218 intrinsics in Intel processors<sup id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>!
    <ul>
      <li>Those can be combined in 6,180 different ways (according to operand sizes and types).</li>
      <li>They‚Äôre grouped into 67 different categories/groups, these groups loosely correspond to various generations of CPUs as more and more intrinsics were gradually added.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>More than 94% are vectorized hardware intrinsics, which we‚Äôll define more concretely below.</li>
</ul>

<p>That last point is super-critical: CPU intrinsics, at least in 2020, are overwhelmingly about being able to execute vectorized instructions. That‚Äôs really why you <em>should</em> be paying them attention in the first place. Sure, there‚Äôs additional stuff in there: if you‚Äôre a kernel developer, or writing crypto code, or some other niche-cases, but vectorization is why you are really here, whether you knew it or not.</p>

<p>In C#, we‚Äôve mostly shied away from having intrinsics until CoreCLR 3.0 came along, where intrinsic support became official/complete, championed by <a href="https://twitter.com/tannergooding">@tannergooding</a> as well as others from Microsoft and Intel. but as single-threaded performance has virtually stopped improving, more programming languages started adding intrinsics support (go, rust, Java and now C#) so developers in those languages would have access to these specialized, much more efficient instructions. CoreCLR 3.0 does not support all 1,218 intrinsics that I found, but a more modest 226 intrinsics in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86?view=netcore-3.0&amp;viewFallbackFrom=dotnet-plat-ext-3.0">15 different classes</a> for x86 Intel and AMD processors. Each class is filled with many static functions, all of which are unique processor intrinsics, and represent a 1:1 mapping to Intel group/code names. As C# developers, we roughly get access to everything that Intel incorporated in their processors manufactured from 2014 and onwards<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>, and for AMD processors, from 2015 onwards.</p>

<p>What are these vectorized intrinsics?<br>
We need to cover a few base concepts specific to that category of intrinsics before we can start explaining specific intrinsics/instructions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are vectorized intrinsics, and why have they become so popular.</li>
  <li>How vectorized intrinsics interact with specialized vectorized <em>registers</em>.</li>
  <li>How those registers are reflected as, essentially, new primitive types in CoreCLR 3.0.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="simd-what--why">SIMD What &amp; Why</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm going to use vectorization and SIMD interchangeably from here-on, but for the first and last time, let‚Äôs spell out what SIMD is: <strong>S</strong>ingle <strong>I</strong>nstruction <strong>M</strong>ultiple <strong>D</strong>ata is really a simple idea when you think about it. A lot of code ends up doing ‚Äústuff‚Äù in loops, usually, processing vectors of data one element at a time. SIMD instructions bring a simple new idea to the table: The CPU adds special instructions that can do arithmetic, bit-operations, comparisons and many other types of generalized operations on ‚Äúvectors‚Äù, e.g. process multiple elements per instruction.</p>

<p>The benefit of using this approach to computing is that it allows for much greater efficiency: When we use vectorized intrinsics we end up executing the same <em>number</em> of instructions to process, for example, 8 data elements per instruction. Therefore, we reduce the amount of time the CPU spends decoding instructions for the same amount of work; furthermore, most vectorized instructions operate <em>independently</em> on the various <strong>elements</strong> of the vector and complete their operation at the same number of CPU cycles as the equivalent non-vectorized (or scalar) instruction. In short, in the land of CPU feature economics, vectorization is considered a high bang-for-buck feature: You can get a lot of <em>potential</em> performance for relatively little transistors added to the CPU, as long as people are willing to adapt their code (e.g. rewrite it) to use these new intrinsics, or compilers somehow magically manage to auto-vectorize the code (spoiler: There are tons of problems with that too)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Another equally important thing to embrace and understand about vectorized intrinsics is what they don‚Äôt and cannot provide: branching. It‚Äôs pretty much impossible to even attempt to imagine what a vectorized branch instruction would mean. These two concepts don‚Äôt begin to mix. Appropriately, a substantial part of vectorizing code is forcing oneself to accomplishing the given task without using branching. As we will see, branching begets unpredictability, at the CPU level, and unpredictability is our enemy, when we want to go fast.</p>

<p>Of course, I‚Äôm grossly over-romanticizing vectorized intrinsics and their benefits: There are also many non-trivial overheads involved both using them and adding them to our processors and to using them in our code. However, all in all, in the grand picture of CPU/performance economics adding and using vectorized instructions is still, compared to other potential improvements, quite cheap, under the assumption that programmers are willing to make the effort to re-write and maintain vectorized code.</p>

<h4 id="simd-registers">SIMD registers</h4>

<p>After our short introduction to vectorized intrinsics, we need to discuss SIMD registers, and how this piece of the puzzle fits the grand picture: Teaching our CPU to execute 1,000+ vectorized instructions is just part of the story, these instructions need to somehow operate on our data. Do all of these instructions simply take a pointer to memory and run wild with it? The short answer is: <strong>No</strong>. For the <em>most</em> part, CPU instructions dealing with vectorization (with a few notable exceptions) use special registers inside our CPU that are called SIMD registers. This is analogous to scalar (regular, non-vectorized) code we write in any programming language: while some instructions read and write directly to memory, and occasionally some instruction will accept a memory address as an operand, most instructions are register ‚Üî register only.</p>

<p>Just like scalar CPU registers, SIMD registers have a constant bit-width. In Intel these come at 64, 128, 256 and recently 512 bit wide registers. Unlike scalar registers, though, SIMD registers, end up <em>containing multiple</em> data-elements of another primitive type. The same register can and will be used to process a wide-range of primitive data-types, depending on which instruction is using it, as we will shortly demonstrate.</p>

<p>For now, this is all I care to explain about SIMD Registers at the CPU level: We need to be aware of their existence (we‚Äôll see them in disassembly dumps anywat), and since we are dealing with high-perfomance code we kind of need to know how many of them exist inside our CPU.</p>

<h4 id="simd-intrinsic-types-in-c">SIMD Intrinsic Types in C\#</h4>

<p>We‚Äôve touched lightly upon SIMD intrinsics and how they operate (e.g. accept and modify) on SIMD registers. Time to figure out how we can fiddle with everything in C#; we‚Äôll start with the types:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>C# Type</th>
      <th>x86 Registers</th>
      <th>Width (bits)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.vector64?view=netcore-3.0"><code>Vector64&lt;T&gt;</code></a></td>
      <td><code>mmo-mm7</code></td>
      <td>64</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.vector128?view=netcore-3.0"><code>Vector128&lt;T&gt;</code></a></td>
      <td><code>xmm0-xmm15</code></td>
      <td>128</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.vector256?view=netcore-3.0"><code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code></a></td>
      <td><code>ymm0-ymm15</code></td>
      <td>256</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These are primitive vector value-types recognized by the JIT while it is generating machine code. We should try and think about these types just like we think about other special-case primitive types such as <code>int</code> or <code>double</code>, with one exception: These vector types all accept a generic parameter <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>, which may seem a little odd for a primitive type at a first glance, until we remember that their purpose is to contain <em>other</em> primitive types (there‚Äôs a reason they put the word ‚ÄúVector‚Äù in there‚Ä¶); moreover, this generic parameter can‚Äôt just be any type or even value-type we‚Äôd like‚Ä¶ It is limited to the types supported on our CPU and its vectorized intrinsics.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take <code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code>, which I‚Äôll be using exclusively in this series, as an example; <code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code> can be used <strong>only</strong> with the following primitive types:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th><code>typeof(T)</code></th>
<th>
</th><th># Elements</th>
<th></th>
<th>Element Width (bits)</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>byte / sbyte</code></td>  <td>‚û°</td><td>32</td><td>x</td><td>8b</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>short / ushort</code></td><td>‚û°</td> <td>16</td><td>x</td><td>16b</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>int / uint</code></td>    <td>‚û°</td> <td>8</td><td>x</td><td>32b</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>long / ulong</code></td>  <td>‚û°</td> <td>4</td><td>x</td><td>64b</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>float</code></td><td>‚û°</td> <td>8</td><td>x</td><td>32b</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>double</code></td> <td>‚û°</td> <td>4</td><td>x</td><td>64b</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>No matter which type of the supported primitive set we‚Äôll choose, we‚Äôll end up with a total of 256 bits, or the underlying SIMD register width.<br>
Now that we‚Äôve kind of figured out of vector types/registers are represented in C#, let‚Äôs perform some operations on them.</p>

<h3 id="a-few-vectorized-instructions-for-the-road">A few Vectorized Instructions for the road</h3>

<p>Armed with this new understanding and knowledge of <code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code> we can move on and start learning a few vectorized instructions.</p>

<p>Chekhov famously said: ‚ÄúIf in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise, don‚Äôt put it there‚Äù. Here are seven loaded AVX2 pistols; rest assured they are about to fire in the next act. I‚Äôm obviously not going to explain all 1,000+ intrinsics mentioned before, if only not to piss off Anton Chekhov. We will <strong>thoroughly</strong> explain the ones needed to get this party going.<br>

<p>I understand that for first time readers, this list looks like I‚Äôm just name-dropping lots of fancy code names to make myself sound smart, but the unfortunate reality is that we <em>kind of need</em> to know all of these, and here is why: On the right column I‚Äôve provided the actual C# Intrinsic function we will be calling in our code and linked to their docs. But here‚Äôs a funny thing: There is no ‚Äúusable‚Äù documentation on Microsoft‚Äôs own docs regarding most of these intrinsics. All those docs do is simply point back to the Intel C/C++ intrinsic name, which I‚Äôve also provided in the middle column, with links to the real documentation, the sort that actually explains what the instruction does with pseudo code. Finally, since we‚Äôre practically writing assembly code anyways, and I can guarantee we‚Äôll end up inspecting JIT‚Äôd code down the road, I provided the x86 assembly opcodes for our instructions as well.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup>
Now, What does each of these do? Let‚Äôs find out‚Ä¶</p>

</tbody></table>

<h4 id="vector256createint-value">Vector256.Create(int value)</h4>

<div>
  

  <p>We start with a couple of simple instructions, and nothing is more simple than this first: This intrinsic accepts a single scalar value and simply ‚Äúbroadcasts‚Äù it to an entire SIMD register, this is how you‚Äôd use it:</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>Vector256</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>someVector256</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vector256</span><span>.</span><span>Create</span><span>(</span><span>0x42</span><span>);</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>This will load up <code>someVector256</code> with 8 copies of <code>0x42</code> once executed, and in x64 assembly, the JIT will produce something quite simple:</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>vmovd</span>  <span>xmm0</span><span>,</span> <span>rax</span>          <span>; 3 cycle latency / 1 cycle throughput</span>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>This specific intrinsic is translated into two intel opcodes, since there is no direct single instruction that performs this.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="avx2loaddquvector256--avxstore">Avx2.LoadDquVector256 / Avx.Store</h4>

<div>
  

  <p>Next up we have a couple of brain dead simple intrinsics that we use to read/write from memory into SIMD registers and conversely store from SIMD registers back to memory. These are amongst the most common intrinsics out there, as you can imagine:</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2

</pre></td><td><pre><span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>...;</span> <span>// Get some pointer to a big enough array</span>

<span>...</span>
<span>Avx</span><span>.</span><span>Store</span><span>(</span><span>ptr</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>);</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>And in x64 assembly:</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>vlddqu</span> <span>ymm1</span><span>,</span> <span>ymmword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[rdi]</span>  <span>; 5 cycle latency + cache/memory</span>

<span>vmovdqu</span> <span>ymmword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[rdi],</span> <span>ymm1</span> <span>; Same as above</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>I only included an SVG animation for <code>LoadDquVector256</code>, but you can use your imagination and visualize how <code>Store</code> simply does the same thing in reverse.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="comparegreaterthan">CompareGreaterThan</h4>

<div>
  

  <p><code>CompareGreaterThan</code> does an <em>n</em>-way, element-by-element <em>greater-than</em> (<code>&gt;</code>) comparison between two <code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code> instances. In our case where <code>T</code> is really <code>int</code>, this means comparing 8 integers in one go, instead of performing 8 comparisons serially!</p>

  <p>But where is the result? In a new <code>Vector256&lt;int&gt;</code> of course! The resulting vector contains 8 results for the corresponding comparisons between the elements of the first and second vectors. Each position where the element in the first vector was <em>greater-than</em> (<code>&gt;</code>) the second vector, the corresponding element in the result vector gets a <code>-1</code> value, or <code>0</code> otherwise.<br>
Calling this is rather simple:</p>

  <p>And in x64 assembly, this is pretty simple too:</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>vpcmpgtd</span> <span>ymm2</span><span>,</span> <span>ymm1</span><span>,</span> <span>ymm0</span> <span>; 1 cycle latency</span>
                          <span>; 0.5 cycle throughput</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>  </div>

</div>
<h4 id="movemask">MoveMask</h4>

<div>
  

  <p>Another intrinsic which will prove to be very useful is the ability to extract some bits from a vectorized register into a normal, scalar one. <code>MoveMask</code> does just this. This intrinsic takes the top-level (MSB) bit from every element and moves it into our scalar result:</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>Vector256</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>data</span><span>;</span>
<span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>Avx</span><span>.</span><span>MoveMask</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>AsSingle</span><span>());</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>There‚Äôs an oddity here, as you can tell by that awkward <code>.AsSingle()</code> call, try to ignore it if you can, or hit this footnote<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">5</a></sup> if you can‚Äôt. The assembly instruction here is exactly as simple as you would think:</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>vmovmskps</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>ymm2</span>  <span>; 5 cycle latency</span>
                     <span>; 1 cycle throughput</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>  </div>

</div>

<h4 id="popcount">PopCount</h4>

<p><code>PopCount</code> is a very powerful intrinsic, which <a href="https://bits.houmus.org/2018-08-19/netcoreapp3.0-intrinsics-in-real-life-pt2">I‚Äôve covered extensively before</a>: <code>PopCount</code> returns the number of <code>1</code> bits in a 32/64 bit primitive.<br>
In C#, we would use it as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>PopCnt</span><span>.</span><span>PopCount</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>b0000111100110011</span><span>);</span>
<span>// result == 8</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And in x64 assembly code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>popcnt</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>rdx</span>  <span>; 3 cycle latency</span>
                 <span>; 1 cycle throughput</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this series, <code>PopCount</code> is the only intrinsic I use that is not purely vectorized<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">6</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="permutevar8x32">PermuteVar8x32</h4>

<div>
  

  <p><code>PermuteVar8x32</code> accepts two vectors: source, permutation and performs a permutation operation <strong>on</strong> the source value <em>according to the order provided</em> in the permutation value. If this sounds confusing go straight to the visualization below‚Ä¶</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>Vector256</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>perm</span><span>;</span>
<span>Vector256</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>Avx2</span><span>.</span><span>PermuteVar8x32</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>perm</span><span>);</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>While technically speaking, both the <code>data</code> and <code>perm</code> parameters are of type <code>Vector256&lt;int&gt;</code> and can contain any integer value in their elements, only the 3 least significant bits in <code>perm</code> are taken into account for permutation of the elements in <code>data</code>.<br>
This should make sense, as we are permuting an 8-element vector, so we need 3 bits (2<sup>3</sup> == 8) in every permutation element to figure out which element goes where‚Ä¶ In x64 assembly this is:</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>vpermd</span> <span>ymm1</span><span>,</span> <span>ymm2</span><span>,</span> <span>ymm1</span> <span>; 3 cycles latency</span>
                        <span>; 1 cycles throughput</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>  </div>

</div>

<h3 id="thats-it-for-now">That‚Äôs it for now</h3>

<p>This post was all about laying the groundwork before this whole mess comes together.<br>
Remember, we‚Äôre re-implementing QuickSort with AVX2 intrinsics in this series, which for the most part, means re-implementing the partitioning function from our scalar code listing in the previous post.<br>
I‚Äôm sure wheels are turning in many heads now as you are trying to figure out what comes next‚Ä¶<br>
I think it might be a good time as any to end this post and leave you with a suggestion: Try to take a piece of paper or your favorite text editor, and see if you can some cobble up these instructions into something that can partition numbers given a selected pivot.</p>

<p>When you‚Äôre ready, head on to the <a href="https://bits.houmus.org/2020-01-30/this-goes-to-eleven-pt3">next post</a> to see how the whole thing comes together, and how fast we can get it to run with a basic version‚Ä¶</p>
