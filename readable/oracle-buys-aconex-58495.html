<p><strong>Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</strong><br>
This document contains certain forward-looking statements about Oracle and Aconex, including statements that involve risks and uncertainties concerning Oracle’s proposed acquisition of Aconex, anticipated customer benefits and general business outlook. When used in this document, the words “anticipates”, “can”, “will”, “look forward to”, “expected” and similar expressions and any other statements that are not historical facts are intended to identify those assertions as forward-looking statements. Any such statement may be influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the control of Oracle or Aconex, that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected, described, expressed or implied in this document due to a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential risks and uncertainties include, among others, the possibility thatthe anticipated synergies of the combined companies may not be achieved after closing, the combined operations may not be successfully integrated in a timely manner, if at all, general economic conditions in regions in which either company does business, and the possibility that Oracle or Aconex may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what impact they will have on the results of operations or financial condition of Oracle or Aconex.</p>

<p>In addition, please refer to the documents that Oracle files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and that Aconex files with the Australian Securities Exchange Ltd. (the “ASX”) on its Market Announcements Platform. These filings identify and address other important factors that could cause Oracle’s and Aconex’s respective operational and other results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements set forth in this document. You are cautioned to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this document. Neither Oracle nor Aconex is under any duty to update any of the information in this document.</p>

<p>Oracle is currently reviewing the existing Aconex product roadmap and will be providing guidance to customers in accordance with Oracle’s standard product communication policies. Any resulting features and timing of release of such features as determined by Oracle’s review of the Aconex product roadmap are at the sole discretion of Oracle.
