<p>In my last post I alluded to the tension between real-world token-based security architectures, the OAuth 2.0 scope model, JWT access tokens and the audience claim.</p>



<p>We went through a couple of iterations in IdentityServer how we deal with those concepts.</p>



<p><strong>IdentityServer3</strong><br>By that time OAuth/OIDC and the usage of JWTs was very new, so everybody made their own sense of these technologies – especially how they are supposed to work together.</p>



<p>We decided that the audience claim in JWTs doesn’t really map to OAuth and its scope concept, so we didn’t really use the <em>aud</em> claim. Instead we emitted the granted scopes in the <em>scope</em> claim.</p>



<p>Mostly to make JWT libraries happy, we also emitted a static <em>aud</em> claim. The format was <em>issuer_name/resources</em> and was a way in APIs to make sure that this is an access token coming from a certain issuer.</p>



<p><strong><em>IdentityServer4 v1-v3</em></strong><br>In IdentityServer4 we introduced the <em>ApiResource</em> abstraction to make it easier to structure the API surface. In our configuration model, you could add named APIs that could act as a container for scopes and other settings. If an API resource did not define an explicit scope, we added one under the covers with the same name as the API.</p>



<p>We continued to emit the granted scopes in the scope claim, but also started emitting the API names as the <em>aud</em> claim. We also made the static <em>aud</em> claim optional.</p>



<p>This led to many scenarios where the <em>aud</em> and <em>scope</em> claims were identical, and it felt wrong to force everyone into the resource abstraction – and certainly against the original spirit of OAuth.</p>



<p><strong>IdentityServer4 v4</strong><br>With the advent of the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html">resource indicator spec</a>, we finally have a more formalized way how resources relate to scopes – and this is also a perfect match for our resource configuration model.</p>



<p>But at the same time, we’ve done a lot of consulting for very different types of OAuth-based installation over the last years to know, that not everyone needs the resource concept.</p>



<p>That’s why we decided to give you more control – you can either model scopes as a flat list, or hierarchical. Which means you can go from a very simple model like read/write/update scopes to very complex namespaced resource/scope combinations. Also sharing scopes between resources is now possible as well.</p>



<p>We made the <em>aud</em> claim optional again (for a scopes only model) – or static – or based on the requested resource. It’s up to you now.</p>



<p>While we were at it, we also enabled easy support for parameterized scopes like e.g. <em>transaction:id</em> since they are used for some recent APIs specs like FAPI of FHIR.</p>



<p>These changes will require some minor <a href="https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/resources.html#migration-steps-to-v4">migration</a> steps when upgrading to v4, but allows for more flexibility.</p>



<p>Also, the work we did is foundational for the next step in IdentityServer’s resource access story, which is supporting resource isolation – or IOW resource indicators. This will ship in the next major update – which will be around end of this year, so stay tuned.</p>
