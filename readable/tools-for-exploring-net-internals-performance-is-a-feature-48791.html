  <p><span>15 Jun 2018 - 1954 words</span></p><p>Whether you want to look at what your code is doing ‘<em>under-the-hood</em>’ or you’re trying to see what the ‘<em>internals</em>’ of the CLR look like, there is a whole range of tools that can help you out.</p>

<p>To give ‘<em>credit where credit is due</em>’, this post is <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewwarren/status/973940550473797633">based on a tweet</a>, so thanks to everyone who contributed to the list and if I’ve <strong>missed out any tools, please let me know in the comments below</strong>.</p>

<p>While you’re here, I’ve also written other posts that look at the ‘internals’ of the .NET Runtime:</p>

<h2 id="honourable-mentions">Honourable Mentions</h2>

<p>Firstly I’ll start by mentioning that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sc65sadd.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396">Visual Studio has a great debugger</a> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging">so does VSCode</a>. Also there are lots of very good (commercial) <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3927/what-are-some-good-net-profilers">.NET Profilers</a> and <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-NET-Application-Server-Monitoring-Tool">Application Monitoring Tools</a> available that you should also take a look at. For example I’ve recently been playing around with <a href="http://www.getcodetrack.com/">Codetrack</a> and I’m very impressed by what it can do!</p>

<p>However, the rest of the post is going to look at some more <strong>single-use tools</strong> that give a <strong>even deeper insight</strong> into what is going on. As a added bonus they’re all ‘<strong>open-source</strong>’, so you can take a look at the code and see how they work!!</p>

<h3 id="perfview-by-vance-morrison"><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview">PerfView</a> by <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vancem/">Vance Morrison</a></h3>

<p>PerfView is simply an excellent tool and is the one that I’ve used most over the years. It uses <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb968803%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396">‘Event Tracing for Windows’ (ETW) Events</a> to provide a <strong>deep insight into what the CLR is doing</strong>, as well as allowing you to <strong>profile Memory and CPU usage</strong>. It does have a fairly steep learning curve, but there are some <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/PerfView-Tutorial">nice tutorials to help you along the way</a> and it’s absolutely worth the time and effort.</p>

<p>Also, if you need more proof of how useful it is, Microsoft Engineers themselves use it and many of the recent <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/02/02/net-core-2-1-roadmap/#user-content-build-time-performance">performance improvements in MSBuild</a> were carried out after using <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/search?q=PerfView&amp;type=Issues">PerfView to find the bottlenecks</a>.</p>

<p>PerfView is built on-top of the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent/">Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent library</a> which you can use in your own tools. In addition, since it’s been open-sourced the community has contributed and it has gained some really nice features, <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview/pull/502">including flame-graphs</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://mattwarren.org/images/2018/06/PerfView%20Flamegraphs.png"><img src="https://mattwarren.org/images/2018/06/PerfView%20Flamegraphs.png" alt="PerfView Flamegraphs"></a></p>

<h3 id="sharplab-by-andrey-shchekin"><a href="https://sharplab.io/">SharpLab</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/ashmind">Andrey Shchekin</a></h3>

<p>SharpLab started out as a tool for inspecting the IL code emitted by the Roslyn compiler, but has now grown <a href="https://github.com/ashmind/SharpLab">into much more</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SharpLab is a .NET code playground that shows intermediate steps and results of code compilation.
Some language features are thin wrappers on top of other features – e.g. <code>using()</code> becomes <code>try/catch</code>.
SharpLab allows you to see the code as compiler sees it, and get a better understanding of .NET languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If supports C#, Visual Basic and F#, but most impressive are the ‘Decompilation/Disassembly’ features:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are currently four targets for decompilation/disassembly:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Visual Basic</li>
    <li>IL</li>
    <li>JIT Asm (Native Asm Code)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s right, it will output the <a href="https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgZgpghgLgrgJwgZwLQBEJinANjASQDsYIFsBjCAgWwAdcIaITYBLAeyIBoYQpkNAD4ABAAwACEQEYA3AFgAUCIDMUgEwSAwhIDeSiYalqRAFgkBZABQBKPQaOOAblAQTSyGBIC8EgKwAdGIKio6OMgCcVh4wNiGOAL5KCUA==">assembly code</a> that the .NET JIT generates from your C#:</p>

<h3 id="object-layout-inspector-by-sergey-teplyakov"><a href="https://github.com/SergeyTeplyakov/ObjectLayoutInspector">Object Layout Inspector</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/STeplyakov">Sergey Teplyakov</a></h3>

<p>This tool gives you an insight into the memory layout of your .NET objects, i.e. it will show you how the JITter has <strong>decided to arrange the fields</strong> within your <code>class</code> or <code>struct</code>. This can be useful when writing high-performance code and it’s helpful to have a tool that does it for us because doing it manually is tricky:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no official documentation about fields layout because the CLR authors reserved the right to change it in the future. But knowledge about the layout can be helpful if you’re curious or if you’re working on a performance critical application.</p>

  <p>How can we inspect the layout? We can look at a raw memory in Visual Studio or use <code>!dumpobj</code> command in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/sos-dll-sos-debugging-extension">SOS Debugging Extension</a>. These approaches are tedious and boring, so we’ll try to write a tool that will print an object layout at runtime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the example in the <a href="https://github.com/SergeyTeplyakov/ObjectLayoutInspector#inspecting-a-value-type-layout-at-runtime">GitHub repo</a>, if you use <code>TypeLayout.Print&lt;NotAlignedStruct&gt;()</code> with code like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>struct</span> <span>NotAlignedStruct</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>byte</span> <span>m_byte1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>m_int</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>byte</span> <span>m_byte2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>short</span> <span>m_short</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’ll get the following output, showing exactly how the CLR will layout the <code>struct</code> in memory, based on it’s padding and optimization rules.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Size: 12. Paddings: 4 (%33 of empty space)
|================================|
|     0: Byte m_byte1 (1 byte)   |
|--------------------------------|
|   1-3: padding (3 bytes)       |
|--------------------------------|
|   4-7: Int32 m_int (4 bytes)   |
|--------------------------------|
|     8: Byte m_byte2 (1 byte)   |
|--------------------------------|
|     9: padding (1 byte)        |
|--------------------------------|
| 10-11: Int16 m_short (2 bytes) |
|================================|
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-ultimate-net-experiment-tune-by-konrad-kokosa"><a href="http://tooslowexception.com/the-ultimate-net-experiment-project/">The Ultimate .NET Experiment (TUNE)</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/konradkokosa">Konrad Kokosa</a></h3>

<p>TUNE is a really intriguing tool, as it says on the <a href="https://github.com/kkokosa/Tune">GitHub page</a>, it’s purpose is to help you</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… learn .NET internals and performance tuning by experiments with C# code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can find out more information about what it does <a href="http://tooslowexception.com/the-ultimate-net-experiment-project/">in this blog post</a>, but at a high-level it <a href="https://github.com/kkokosa/Tune">works like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>write a sample, valid C# script which contains at least one class with public method taking a single string parameter. It will be executed by hitting Run button. This script can contain as many additional methods and classes as you wish. Just remember that first public method from the first public class will be executed (with single parameter taken from the input box below the script). …</li>
    <li>after clicking Run button, the script will be compiled and executed. Additionally, it will be <strong>decompiled both to IL (Intermediate Language) and assembly code</strong> in the corresponding tabs.</li>
    <li>all the time Tune is running (including time during script execution) a graph with GC data is being drawn. It shows information about <strong>generation sizes and GC occurrences</strong> (illustrated as vertical lines with the number below indicating which generation has been triggered).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>And looks like this:</p>

<p>Finally, we’re going to look at a particular category of tools. Since .NET came out you’ve always been able to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/getting-started-with-windbg">WinDBG</a> and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/sos-dll-sos-debugging-extension">SOS Debugging Extension</a> to get deep into the .NET runtime. However it’s not always the easiest tool to <strong>get started with</strong> and as this tweet says, it’s not always the most <strong>productive</strong> way to do things:</p>

<twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-0"></twitter-widget><blockquote data-lang="en" data-twitter-extracted-i1581918707725699456="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Besides how complex it is, the idea is to build better abstractions. Raw debugging at the low level is just usually too unproductive. That to me is the promise of ClrMD, that it lets us build specific extensions to extract quickly the right info</p>— Tomas Restrepo (@tomasrestrepo) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomasrestrepo/status/973924168365498370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2018</a></blockquote>


<p>Fortunately Microsoft made the <a href="https://mattwarren.org/2016/09/06/Analysing-.NET-Memory-Dumps-with-CLR-MD/">ClrMD library available</a> (a.k.a <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime">Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime</a>), so now anyone can write a tool that analyses <strong>memory dumps</strong> of .NET programs. You can find out even more info in the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2013/05/01/net-crash-dump-and-live-process-inspection/">official blog post</a> and I also recommend taking a look at <a href="https://github.com/JeffCyr/ClrMD.Extensions">ClrMD.Extensions</a> that “<em>.. provide integration with LINPad and to make ClrMD even more easy to use</em>”.</p>

<p>I wanted to pull together a list of all the existing tools, so I enlisted <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewwarren/status/973940550473797633">twitter to help</a>. <strong>Note to self</strong>: careful what you tweet, the WinDBG Product Manager might read your tweets and <a href="https://twitter.com/aluhrs13/status/973948038380109824">get a bit upset</a>!!</p>

<twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-1"></twitter-widget><blockquote data-lang="en" data-twitter-extracted-i1581918707725699456="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well this just hurts my feelings :(</p>— Andy Luhrs (@aluhrs13) <a href="https://twitter.com/aluhrs13/status/973948038380109824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2018</a></blockquote>


<p>Most of these tools are based on ClrMD because it’s the easiest way to do things, however you can use the <a href="https://twitter.com/goldshtn/status/973941389791809540">underlying COM interfaces directly</a> if you want. Also, it’s worth pointing out that any tool based on ClrMD is <strong>not cross-platform</strong>, because <a href="https://twitter.com/goldshtn/status/973942794296406017">ClrMD itself is Windows-only</a>. For cross-platform options see <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/sasha/2017/02/26/analyzing-a-net-core-core-dump-on-linux/">Analyzing a .NET Core Core Dump on Linux</a></p>

<p>Finally, in the interest of balance, there have been lots of recent <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windbg/2017/08/28/new-windbg-available-in-preview/">improvements to WinDBG</a> and because it’s extensible there have been various efforts to add functionality to it:</p>
