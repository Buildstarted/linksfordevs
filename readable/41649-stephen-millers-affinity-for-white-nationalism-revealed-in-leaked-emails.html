Roof’s attack triggered a national conversation about racial hatred in the United States. In response, Amazon.com and other retailers <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/06/23/confederate-flag-walmart-roof-emanuel/29153957/"> made efforts to pull the Confederate flag</a>&nbsp;from their websites and stores.</p><p>Miller sought to create a counternarrative to this news through Breitbart, the emails show. He emailed McHugh with the subject line “defies modern comprehension” on June 23, 2015, following the news about the retailers, and highlighted a statistic about the deaths of Confederate soldiers with a link to history.com:</p><blockquote><p><u>Miller, June 23, 2015, 3:10 p.m. ET:</u> “‘22.6 percent of Southern men who were between the ages of 20 and 24 in 1860 lost their lives because of the war.’” [<a href="http://www.history.com/news/civil-war-deadlier-than-previously-thought">history.com link</a>]</p></blockquote><p>McHugh told Hatewatch that she and Miller spoke on the phone about the subject of Amazon yanking Confederate flag merchandise after the email. Miller appears to refer to that call in his next email and suggests that McHugh write about how Amazon was selling “commie flags.”</p><blockquote><p><u>Miller, June 23, 2015, 3:31 p.m.<strong></strong>ET:</u> “That's a really, really, really good point.</p><p>Have you thought about going to Amazon and finding the commie flags and then doing a story on that? I think you've hit on something potentially profound.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><u>McHugh, June 23, 2015, 3:32 p.m. ET:</u> “Yes, definitely. There’s all kinds of hammer and sickle merchandise, Che shirts, Stalin shirts… the list goes on and on.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><u>Miller, June 23, 2015, 3:36 p.m. ET:</u> “I think that would be a very big story. Reveals just the stunning corporate hypocrisy that defines our modern culture.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><u>McHugh, June 23, 2015, 3:42 p.m. ET:</u> “Yes, and extra lulz: [Former Obama White House press secretary] Jay Carney, who’s a senior advisor or something for Amazon, displayed Commie propaganda IN HIS HOUSE.” [<a href="http://archive.li/BwnVm">Daily Caller link</a>]</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><u>Miller, June 23, 2015, 4:33 p.m. ET:</u> “This would be the perfect time to resurrect that fact. Brilliant.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><u>McHugh, June 23, 2015, 5:07 p.m. ET:</u> “I’m going to go full Info Wars here: It’s not a coincidence that in the midst of pushing the US-ending trade deal, we’re seeing a historic artifact of real America be demonized and destroyed.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><u>Miller, June 23, 2015, 5:11 p.m. ET:</u> “I betcha they also sell lots of che gueverra garb too.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><u>McHugh, June 23, 2015, 5:13 p.m. ET:</u> “Oh they do. It took a long time to write a very short piece because I feel gripped with anger and despair. But if there was ever a time to stay cheerful, this is it!!”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><u>Miller, June 23, 2015, 5:14 p.m. ET:</u> “shoot me link when you have.”</p></blockquote><p>McHugh and Miller continued to trade emails about the subject later that night. McHugh mentioned that “Confederate monuments [are being] vandalized in the US.” She sent Miller a link to the story she wrote based on their conversation, “<a href="http://archive.li/48lDF#selection-375.0-375.75">Amazon takes down Confederate flag, continues to sell communist merchandise</a>,” noting it was “leading Breitbart.”</p><p>Miller replied:</p><blockquote><p><u>Miller, June 23, 2015, 10:34 p.m. ET:</u> “what do the [Confederate monument] vandals say to the people fighting and dying overseas in uniform right now who are carrying on a seventh or eighth generation of military service in their families, stretching back to our founding?”</p></blockquote><p>The emails show that Miller returned to the subject in subsequent days, tying the debate to immigrants and leftists. He sent an email June 24, 2015, with the subject line “story idea”:</p><blockquote><p><u>Miller, June 24, 2015, 2:07 p.m. ET:</u> “1. Should people of Spanish descent, especially those living in immigrant communities, be banned from displaying the Spanish flag given Spanish conduct in Latin America? 2. Should [Univision anchor] Jorge Ramos apologize for Spanish conduct in Latin America, and redress it by ensuring more people of indigenous backgrounds have hosting duties on his network? 3. Should the cross be removed from immigrant communities, in light of the history of Spanish conquest?”</p></blockquote><p>Miller brought up the issue again one day later:</p><blockquote><p><u>Miller, June 25, 2015, 10:38 a.m. ET:</u> “When will the left be made to apologize for the blood on their hands supporting every commie regime since stalin?”</p></blockquote><p>Preserving Confederate monuments has resonated with the far right, and Trump has repeatedly played to those views.</p><p>Following the August 2017 “Unite the Right” rally, for example, when white nationalists and neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, to protect a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, Trump appeared to defend them, saying that there were “very fine people, on both sides.” A man who marched with white nationalists at Unite the Right murdered antiracist demonstrator Heather Heyer in a car-ramming attack that Aug. 12. Five days later, <a href="http://archive.li/eg1NZ">Trump tweeted</a>:</p><p>“Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.”</p></div></div></div></div>
