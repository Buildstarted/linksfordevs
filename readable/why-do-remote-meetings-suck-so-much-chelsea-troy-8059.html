But even when the tool works perfectly, you might find remote meetings harder than colocated ones.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s harder for you to find your moments to talk and listen to others.</p>
<p>Maybe you cannot see the remote folks very well to judge their reactions.</p>
<p>Or maybe the audio lag means people accidentally talk over each other.</p>
<p data-key="171"><span data-key="170">You’re right. You are absolutely noticing these issues more often in remote meetings than colocated meetings.</span></p>
<p data-key="173"><span data-key="172"><strong>I have some bad news about why, and you’re really going to hate it, so I recommend getting a cup of tea before you read this next part.</strong></span></p>

<p data-key="175"><span data-key="174">Let’s start with an exercise.</span></p>
<p data-key="177"><span data-key="176">Picture yourself sitting or standing in a meeting room. All of the other members of the meeting are arranged around the table with you. Check all the statements that apply to you.</span></p>
<div>
<p data-key="179"><span data-key="178"><strong>Part A</strong></span></p>
<p data-key="218"><span data-key="180">__ I’m good at extemporaneous speaking</span></p>
<p data-key="218"><span data-key="180">__ I usually have ample opportunities to share my thoughts</span></p>
<p data-key="218"><span data-key="180">__ I don’t always have to think about what I have to say before I start saying it </span></p>
<p data-key="218"><span data-key="180"> __ When I start to speak in a meeting, I rarely find myself getting interrupted</span></p>
<p data-key="218"><span data-key="180">__ I only need a little bit of information about a topic before I start to form an opinion on it</span></p>
<p data-key="218"><span data-key="180"> __ When I share my thoughts in a meeting, people usually listen </span></p>
<p data-key="218"><span data-key="180">__ I think that my ideas are usually valuable contributions to discussion </span></p>
<p data-key="218"><span data-key="180">__ I get to participate in lively debates about the future of our business, products, or people</span></p>
<p data-key="220"><span data-key="219"><strong>Part B</strong></span></p>
<p data-key="259"><span data-key="221">__ I often start to speak and then miss my opportunity</span></p>
<p data-key="259"><span data-key="221"> __ I word my thought very carefully so I do not strike my coworkers as ‘abrasive’ or ‘aggressive’</span></p>
<p data-key="384"><span data-key="346">__ I regularly get interrupted multiple times in a single meeting</span></p>
<p data-key="259"><span data-key="221"> __ When I share an idea, sometimes someone repeats my idea later without mentioning that I said it</span></p>
<p data-key="259"><span data-key="221"> __ When I share a thought, I usually get ‘devil’s advocate’ questions that challenge me or ask me to prove it</span></p>
<p data-key="259"><span data-key="221"> __ I think there are topics that my personal experiences do not qualify me to publicly opine on </span></p>
<p data-key="259"><span data-key="221">__ Sometimes I watch lively debates, but I don’t feel comfortable or welcome participating in them. </span></p>
<p data-key="259"><span data-key="221">__ I often leave meetings feeling disappointed that I did not have the chance to share my ideas</span></p>
<p data-key="261"><span data-key="260"><strong>What I am thinking right now:</strong></span></p>
<p data-key="263"><span data-key="262"><strong>Part C</strong></span></p>
<p data-key="267"><span data-key="264">__ I’m starting to get an idea of what the bad news is.</span></p>
<p data-key="269"><span data-key="268"><strong>Part D</strong></span></p>
<p data-key="273"><span data-key="270">__ I really have no idea why you’re asking me to fill out this checklist.</span></p>
</div>
<p data-key="276"><span data-key="274">Great job! We’ll use your results to calculate your <strong><em>caucus score</em></strong>. </span></p>
<p data-key="276"><span data-key="274">What the heck is a caucus score?</span></p>
<p data-key="285"><span data-key="277">A&nbsp;<strong><em>caucus</em></strong>&nbsp;(and specifically an&nbsp;<em>unmoderated caucus</em>) is a type of meeting with no rules about who talks in what order or for how long. Instead folks jump in whenever they have something to say. The caucus probably sounds akin to some of your business meetings: most teams consider this meeting setup ‘not too formal’ and therefore lean on it in some format.</span></p>
<p data-key="287"><span data-key="286">How to calculate your caucus score:</span></p>
<ol data-key="297">
<li>
<div data-key="290">
<p><span data-key="288">Add up all of your checkmarks from parts A and D.</span></p>
</div>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<div data-key="296">
<p><span data-key="294">Subtract from this total the number of checkmarks from parts B and C.</span></p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p data-key="299"><span data-key="298">The maximum score is 18. The minimum score is 0.</span></p>
<p data-key="301"><span data-key="300">You caucus score describes how likely you are to have a positive, productive experience contributing to a caucus-style meeting.</span></p>
<p>
<h3 data-key="303"><span data-key="302">Suppose you have a pretty high caucus score—let’s say 14 or 15.</span></h3>
</p>
<p data-key="305"><span data-key="304">You’re questioning remote work because you’ve had more problems with remote meetings than colocated meetings. In colocated meetings, you have few qualms about taking the speaking floor and you usually have a positive experience when you do so. In remote meetings, you’ve had more trouble, and you’d like it to not be that way.</span></p>
<p data-key="305"><span data-key="304">I have to bear some bad news: the way you feel about remote meetings is the way some of your coworkers feel about <em>every</em> meeting. The remote meeting isn’t the cause of the problem: rather, the <strong><em>unwritten</em>&nbsp;<em>caucus rule</em></strong> is the cause of the problem, and remoteness happens to exacerbate that problem to the point that even people with&nbsp;<em>high </em>caucus scores notice the friction.</span></p>
<p data-key="305">What is the&nbsp;<em><strong>unwritten caucus rule</strong>? </em></p>
<p data-key="305">See if you can spot it in this example:</p>
<div>
<p>Latifah spends a few minutes presenting her perspective on something in a meeting. Her points are well-considered, and it’s clear that she has spent time considering this.</p>
<p>When Latifah finishes, Alessandra asks a poignant question the perspective Latifah just shared. Latifah (caucus score 6) has thought long and hard about that question, so she takes a breath and pauses for a moment to compose, in her head, a coherent explanation.</p>
<p>Just at that moment, Todd (caucus score 17) pipes up with his half-baked ramblings on the question. Latifah loses her chance to answer the question she was clearly well-positioned to answer, and the room spends 4 minutes listening to Todd <em>umm</em> and <em>uhh</em> his way to his opinion.*</p>
</div>
<p data-key="319">*I swear to god this example was written months ago and<i>&nbsp;</i>does not reference a particular instance. This situation happens&nbsp;<em>so much</em> that, at any given moment, it looks eerily similar to something you witnessed at work not long ago.</p>
<p data-key="319"><span data-key="316">Sure, meetings should have leeway for people to figure out what they think. But Latifah already had a very well-considered answer to this question. Todd did not. Can we agree that, based on that information, Latifah should have gotten precedence to speak? </span></p>
<p data-key="319"><span data-key="316">But in caucuses, it’s not Latifah who gets the chance to speak. Why? Because Latifah&nbsp;<em>paused</em>&nbsp;to consider what the last person said before she said anything. </span></p>
<p data-key="319"><span data-key="316">In caucuses you can’t do that because of the</span><span data-key="316"><strong><em> unwritten caucus rule</em></strong>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p data-key="319"><span data-key="316"><strong>The first person to utter something gets the floor.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p data-key="325">That delightfully informal dynamic turns out to be not so delightful.</p>
<p data-key="325"><span data-key="320">To wit: if you have something you want to say, you have to <em>stop listening</em> to the person currently speaking and instead focus on when they’re gonna pause or finish so you can leap into that <em>nanosecond</em> of silence and be the first to utter something. </span></p>
<p data-key="325"><span data-key="320">The format of a caucus encourages participants who want to contribute to&nbsp;<em>say</em>&nbsp;more and&nbsp;<em>listen</em>&nbsp;less.</span></p>
<p data-key="334"><span data-key="326">This is a big structural reason why&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/07/23/study_men_interrupt_women_more_in_tech_workplaces_but_high_ranking_women.html" aria-label="http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/07/23/study_men_interrupt_women_more_in_tech_workplaces_but_high_ranking_women.html" data-key="328"><span data-key="327">people interrupt each other all the time</span></a><span data-key="329">. When the way that you get the floor in a meeting is to&nbsp;<em>just start talking</em>, that’s what people do. Sometimes the interruption is an accident because the interrupter gets excited and forgets that it’s not their turn. Sometimes the interruption is an accident because the interruptor thought the previous speaker was finished, but&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;had just paused.</span><span data-key="329">&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/07/23/study_men_interrupt_women_more_in_tech_workplaces_but_high_ranking_women.html">Kieran Snyder has done some fascinating work around who interrupts whom, and of course there are patterns</a>. But how do we change those patterns when the unwritten caucus rule&nbsp;<em>sets us up</em> to interrupt one another?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-key="336"><span data-key="335">Imagine your largest weekly caucus-style meeting. Are there people at that meeting who rarely contribute anything? Or used to contribute more and now kind of…don’t? Or they seem (to you) to get ‘<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2017/11/30/the-4x-rule-for-tech-managers/">too aggressive</a>‘ when people interrupt them?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-key="336"><span data-key="335"><em>Bingo</em>. The way you feel about remote meetings is the way those people feel about <em>every</em> meeting.</span></p>
<p>
<h3 data-key="338"><span data-key="337">Now suppose you do not have a high caucus score.</span></h3>
</p>
<p data-key="341"><span data-key="339">This might mean that you’ve already experienced some frustrations with caucus-style meetings in general. Well, when you hold a caucus remotely, that only makes everything&nbsp;<em>worse! Joy!</em></span></p>
<p>
<h3 data-key="343"><span data-key="342">Remote meetings exacerbate the caucus problem to the point that <em>everyone</em> experiences it.</span></h3>
</p>
<p data-key="345"><span data-key="344">Take a look again at Part B of the caucus score checklist. You checked these boxes before assuming that we were talking about a colocated meeting. Let’s do it again for a meeting you are attending via teleconference:</span></p>
<div>
<p data-key="384"><span data-key="346">__ I often start to speak and then miss my opportunity</span></p>
<p data-key="384"><span data-key="346"> __ I word my thought very carefully so I do not strike my coworkers as ‘abrasive’ or ‘aggressive’</span></p>
<p data-key="384"><span data-key="346"> __ I regularly get interrupted multiple times in a single meeting</span></p>
<p data-key="384"><span data-key="346">__ When I share an idea, sometimes someone repeats my idea later without mentioning that I said it</span></p>
<p data-key="384"><span data-key="346"> __ When I share a thought, I usually get ‘devil’s advocate’ questions that challenge me or ask me to prove it </span></p>
<p data-key="384"><span data-key="346">__ I think there are topics that my personal experiences do not qualify me to publicly opine on </span></p>
<p data-key="384"><span data-key="346">__ Sometimes I watch lively debates, but I don’t feel comfortable or welcome participating in them. </span></p>
<p data-key="384"><span data-key="346">__ I often leave meetings feeling disappointed that I did not have the chance to share my ideas</span></p>
</div>
<p data-key="386"><span data-key="385">Did you check more boxes in this section for a remote meeting than a colocated meeting? Out of 9 people I tested this on, 8 did. The ninth person had checked all of the boxes in the first place and so could not check any more.</span></p>
<p data-key="388"><span data-key="387">Why? Well, jumping in during a caucus requires precise timing: your utterance must be the <em>first</em> utterance <em>after</em> someone finishes speaking <em>without</em> interrupting that speaker. A single second of audio lag can throw off your timing, so you have more people talking over one another and then stopping to figure out who should have or would have talked first. </span></p>
<p data-key="388"><span data-key="387">You also don’t have as much benefit of body language for conveying ideas, and you sometimes have to project further over a poor audio connection or a poor video setup. So you might be more careful to avoid accidentally conveying anger or frustration, which means reviewing your wording before you say things…which means pausing or slowing down. Which can mean losing your place to speak.</span></p>
<p data-key="388"><span data-key="387">And if you’re not a likely candidate to jump in in the first place, or if you have poor experiences with jumping in, then when you find yourself in the off-timing-interruption scenario, you’re very likely to yield the floor to the other person—so you don’t talk at all. In a caucus, the person speaking often does not remember to hold space at the end of their statement for the other person who wanted to speak, so the floor is up for grabs again, and you can easily go the whole meeting without getting your thoughts heard. Then you leave feeling disappointed.</span></p>
<p data-key="404"><span data-key="389">If those are the kinds of frustrations that you notice more during remote meetings, it’s worth thinking about the fact that those frustrations happen in every meeting for some of your staff.* </span></p>

<h3 data-key="404">The Upshot</h3>
<p data-key="404"><span data-key="401">When audio/visual delays exacerbate the caucus problem for people who <em>always</em> get the floor in meetings, it looks to them like a new problem. </span><span data-key="401">It’s not new; it’s just normally experienced by people in meetings with lower caucus scores. Leadership doesn’t notice because people in leadership positions tend to have higher caucus scores, and being in a position of leadership also tends to boost your caucus score (basically because people interrupt you less). But that’s a&nbsp;<em>weakness</em>&nbsp;of the way we identify decision-makers: good ideas come from everywhere, and especially from people who do a lot of thinking and observing before they say anything.</span></p>
<p data-key="409"><span data-key="405"><strong>Making meetings more accessible to remote employees doesn’t just make meetings more accessible to remote employees; it makes meetings more accessible to everyone.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-key="409"><span data-key="405">This is especially true for contributors who aren’t usually recognized as the ‘alpha’ in a meeting setting or who don’t self-select onto the speaking floor. </span></p>
<p data-key="409"><span data-key="405">And&nbsp;</span><span data-key="406">fixing that problem <a href="http://www.bretlsimmons.com/2016-08/rethinking-groupthink-great-advice-leaders-adam-grants-new-book-originals/">can hugely benefit</a> your business</span><span data-key="408">!</span></p>
<p>Remember earlier in this series, when we talked about how&nbsp;<em>some</em> remote work adaptations <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/03/09/remote-work-problems-that-you-have-seen-with-your-own-eyeballs/">would come easily, and some would really suck</a>? This is one of the sucky ones. It’s sucky because it&nbsp;<span data-key="2356">challenges our assumption that ‘informal’ meetings are working just fine. They’re not working just fine: they’re excluding potential contributors. But those are usually not the people in charge, so the problems get overlooked—until remote work makes those problems problematic for&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-key="2365"><span data-key="2362"><strong>The sucky thing about remote work is that it loudly points out the failures in your collaborative process.</strong> You can choose whether to pin those failures on remote work and halt your remote program, or to leverage your newfound insight into the failures of your collaborative process to your <em>advantage</em>—because now you know where to improve. </span></p>
<p data-key="2365"><span data-key="2362">Can we agree that excluding potential contributors in meetings is an obstacle to success? Why&nbsp;<em>wouldn’t</em> you want to gather additional perspectives and make your decisions based on as much information as possible? <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/04/05/how-do-we-make-remote-meetings-not-suck/">The solution, it turns out, has nothing to do with remote work itself. The solution is to address the underlying issue: the way we hold meetings</a>. When we address those issues directly, remote meetings feel less stressful—but also, even if you never hold another remote meeting again,&nbsp;<em>in person</em> meetings will achieve better results.</span></p>
<h3 data-key="2365">An Opportunity to Reflect</h3>
<p data-key="2365">At the end of our <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/03/09/remote-work-problems-that-you-have-seen-with-your-own-eyeballs/">second blog post</a> in this series on remote work, we did an exercise that gave you a chance to write down your feelings about remote work. If you still have that, now is an excellent time to grab it.</p>
<p data-key="2365">Take a look at how you answered that first question about your physical reaction to the idea of remote work. Do a body scan. Are you doing any of that stuff right now? Try taking a deep breath, holding it for a second, and then slowly letting it out. (Sometimes when I’m having a really rough day, I do this nine more times. And each time I exhale I picture all my struggles and commitments being pushed backwards by the force of my breath into a semicircle in front of me, leaving me space to think). Or you can go from the top of your body to the bottom: for each body part, tense it as&nbsp;<em>hard as you can</em> for a second or two, then relax it. Jaw. Hands. Arms. Shoulders. Chest. Stomach. Rear. Legs. Feet. See if this helps you feel better. (Or if it doesn’t and something else does, let me know what works for you in the comments).</p>
<p data-key="2365">Now, let’s look at how you answered the second question about what you’re afraid will happen with a remote team.&nbsp;Do you see any of that coming up in our discussion of remote meetings? Does the caucus problem, exacerbated by remoteness, play a role in any of your fears?</p>
<p data-key="2365">Finally, let’s look at how you answered the third question about your negative experiences with remote work. What were those experiences? Did any of them have to do with remote meetings? Can you connect this caucus problem, exacerbated by remoteness, to any of your sour experiences from past remote engagements?</p>
<p data-key="2365"><a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/04/05/how-do-we-make-remote-meetings-not-suck/">In the next post on this topic, we discuss some alternatives to address the caucus problem</a>. And those alternatives can improve&nbsp;your&nbsp;<em>colocated</em> meetings—not just your remote ones.</p>
