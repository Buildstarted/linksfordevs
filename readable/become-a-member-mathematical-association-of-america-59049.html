<b>V</b>isitors, <b>I</b>nstructors, <b>T</b>As, <b>A</b>djuncts, and <b>L</b>ecturers, however, we know that there is considerable variation in the naming of these positions. This category of membership is intended&nbsp;<u>for instructors employed at MAA Departmental
 Member institutions</u>&nbsp;who are not included in the usual tenure and/or promotion process and whose compensation is not commensurate with faculty who are in those positions. Depending on the institution, this may variously include part-time instructors, non-tenure
 track instructors, and employees in other ancillary instructional positions. (To qualify, you must be at an institution with a current MAA Departmental Membership and provide a validation code, which you can get from your Departmental Membership Administrator
 or Department Chair.)</p></div>
