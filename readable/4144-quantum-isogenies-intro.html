Intro</h1><div><div class="main"><p>Choosing safe post-quantum parameters
for the new CSIDH isogeny-based key-exchange system
requires concrete analysis of the cost of quantum attacks.
The two main contributions to attack cost are
the number of queries in hidden-shift algorithms
and the cost of each query.</p><p>The cost of each query includes
the cost of
evaluating a group action, a series of isogenies, in superposition.
This page reports on our results of
analyzing and optimizing this cost.
Each quantum attack incurs this cost many times.</p><p>Our main result has the following shape:
the CSIDH group action
can be carried out in <em>B</em>
nonlinear bit operations
(counting ANDs and ORs, allowing free XORs and NOTs)
with failure probability at most ε.
(All of our algorithms know when they have failed.)
This implies a reversible computation
of the CSIDH group action
with failure probability at most ε
using at most 2<em>B</em> Toffoli gates
(allowing free NOTs and CNOTs).
This in turn implies a quantum computation
of the CSIDH group action
with failure probability at most ε
using at most 14<em>B</em><em>T</em>-gates
(allowing free Clifford gates).</p><p>The paper below explains how to compute pairs (<em>B</em>,ε)
for any given CSIDH parameters.
For example,
we show how to compute CSIDH-512
for uniform random exponent vectors in {-5,...,5}^74
using</p><ul><li><p>1118827416420 = 2^40
  nonlinear bit operations
  using the algorithm of Section 7,
  or</p></li><li><p>765325228976 = 0.7 2^40
  nonlinear bit operations
  using the algorithm of Section 8,</p></li></ul><p>in both cases
with failure probability below 2^-32.
CSIDH-512 is the smallest parameter set
considered for CSIDH.
For comparison,
computing the same action with failure probability 2^-32
using the Jao–LeGrow–Leonardi–Ruiz-Lopez
algorithm,
with the underlying modular multiplications
computed by the same algorithm as in
Roetteler–Naehrig–Svore–Lauter,
would use approximately 2^51 nonlinear bit operations.</p><p>We exploit a variety of algorithmic ideas,
including several new ideas pushing beyond the
previous state of the art in isogeny computation,
with the goal of obtaining
the best pairs (<em>B</em>,ε).
We introduce
a new constant-time variable-degree isogeny algorithm,
a new application of the Elligator map,
new ways to handle failures in isogeny computations,
new combinations of the components of these computations,
new speeds for integer multiplication,
and more.</p><h3>Papers</h3><p><a href="qisog-20190305.pdf">(PDF)</a>
