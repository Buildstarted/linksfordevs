You can ask things like “Search for sushi in Auckland”, “Close tab” or “How tall is Mount Everest?”</p><p>Currently, Firefox Voice is available for the desktop browser, only supports English, and requires a user to manually <a href="https://va.allizom.org/releases/prod/firefox-voice.xpi">download and install the Add-on</a>, grant permission for microphone access, and trigger the microphone to listen by clicking on an icon in the toolbar or using a keyboard shortcut.</p></details><details><summary></summary><p>The microphone for Firefox Voice is only active when triggered with a button press or keyboard shortcut. We strive to make it clear anytime Firefox Voice is listening as privacy and trust are central to Firefox Voice and Mozilla.</p><p>The microphone access is paused between use, so you may notice an operating system indicator that Firefox is retaining the microphone.</p></details><details><summary></summary><p>By default Firefox Voice does not store voice recordings.</p><p>Users may allow Mozilla to store their voice recordings and computer-generated transcripts of their recordings. Recordings and transcripts are stored securely and without personally identifying information (this means, we don’t know who said them).</p><p>Even if users do not opt-in to allowing storage, they are able to use Firefox Voice.</p><p>In your Preferences,you can change your settings at any time.</p><p>If you allow Mozilla to store your voice recordings, we use your recordings for research purposes and to help improve Firefox Voice. For example, we may use the computer-generated transcripts of your recordings to help identify which commands we should support. We may also manually review your voice recordings to better train our speech service to respond more accurately.</p></details><details><summary></summary><p>Because you can use Firefox Voice to execute a wide variety of commands, it first needs permissions to many of those things on your behalf.</p><dl><dt>Access your data for all websites</dt><dd>This permission allows you to use Firefox Voice to control websites to do things like scroll, copy and paste, find a tab and more.<p>While this permission would make it <em>possible</em> to extract user information from a website, it does not do so. Our <a href="https://mozilla-extensions.github.io/firefox-voice/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> specifies what information we collect (set during installation or later in the preferences). It does NOT include any browsing or site information.</p></dd><dt>Read and modify bookmarks</dt><dd>This is used for commands that open, create, and delete bookmarks.</dd><dt>Read and modify browser settings</dt><dd>Used to open your preferred homepage set in the browser setting.</dd><dt>Get data from the clipboard</dt><dd>Used to enable voice control for "paste".</dd><dt>Input data to the clipboard</dt><dd>Used to enable voice commands for “copy” such as "copy link".</dd><dt>Download files and read and modify the browser’s download history</dt><dd>Used for commands such as "save page" and "save screenshot" that download files.</dd><dt>Read the text of all open tabs</dt><dd>Used for the command "find [query] in page".</dd><dt>Access browsing history</dt><dd>Used to determine your preferred music service. E.g., if you visit<code>spotify.com</code> often/recently, it is presumed to be your preferred service.</dd><dt>Hide and show browser tabs</dt><dd>Firefox Voice executes searches in the background, sometimes taking you directly to search results or cards. We use a "hidden" tab to do this, so these automatically-created search tabs do not clutter your normal tab layout.</dd><dt>Access browser tabs</dt><dd>Used for finding and managing your tabs.</dd></dl></details><details><summary></summary><p>The current release of Firefox Voice is an experiment to better understand the needs and desire for voice interactions within the browser. At this time no decision has been made on when or if the add-on will come bundled by default with Firefox. Future development depends on feedback and performance of the Add-On.</p></details><details><summary></summary><p>Mozilla is experimenting with voice in a number projects including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://voice.mozilla.org/">Common Voice</a>: A crowdsourcing project to create a free database for speech recognition software. The project is supported by volunteers who record sample sentences with a microphone and review recordings of other users.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS">Mozilla TTS</a>: A deep learning based text-to-speech engine, low in cost and high in quality.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech">Project DeepSpeech</a>: An open source Speech-To-Text engine, using a model trained by machine learning techniques.</li></ul></details><details><summary></summary><p>When you make a request using Firefox Voice, the browser captures the audio and uses cloud-based services to transcribe and then process the request. Below are the steps and services utilized.</p><ol><li>The microphone must be opened with a button press or keyboard shortcut.</li><li>After you finish speaking the microphone is turned off.</li><li>Audio from your voice request is sent to Mozilla’s Voicefill server without any personally identifiable metadata.</li><li>Voicefill sends the audio to Google’s Speech-to-Text engine, which returns transcribed text. We’ve instructed the Google Speech-to-Text engine to NOT save any recordings. Note: In the future, we expect to enable Mozilla’s own technology for Speech-to-Text which enables us to stop using Google’s Speech-to-Text engine.</li><li><p>Based on the transcribed text, Firefox Voice attempts to fulfill your request.</p><ul><li>For example, if you say “Go to…” or “Find…” a Search using your default search engine will be executed. Note: if you’re using Google Search and are logged into your Google account in Firefox, your search will be associated with your Google search history.</li><li>Requests such as “Close tab” or “Read this page” are processed directly by the browser.</li></ul></li><li>We’ve instructed Google Speech-to-text not to retain audio once the request has been processed. In addition, Mozilla does not retain any audio unless you’ve actively chosen to allow Mozilla to collect audio recordings for the purpose of improving our speech recognition service.</li></ol></details><details><summary></summary><p>Antivirus and other security software can sometimes prevent Firefox extensions from being downloaded, installed or updated.</p><img src="https://voice.mozilla.org/firefox-voice/images/connection-error.png" alt="Tooltip dialog window showing an error message upon installing the add-on. The message reads: 'The add-on could not be downloaded because of a connection failure.'"><p>If you’re having trouble installing Firefox Voice or it doesn’t update automatically, follow these steps to install the extension manually:</p><ol><li>Open a different browser, like Safari, Chrome, or Microsoft Edge.</li><li>Copy and paste the <a href="https://va.allizom.org/releases/prod/firefox-voice.xpi">download</a> link into the different browser. It will be saved as a .xpi file in your Downloads folder.</li><li>Open Firefox and drag the .xpi file to the Firefox window, then click Add.</li></ol></details><details><summary></summary><p>If you’re having trouble getting Firefox Voice to hear what you're saying and take action the microphone may not be picking up audio. Check that your microphone is set up correctly.</p><ol><li>Ensure your device has a microphone or your external microphone is plugged in.</li><li>Check Firefox Voice has permissions to access the mic.</li><li>Restart Firefox. This can often clear up the issue.</li></ol></details></section></div></div></div>
