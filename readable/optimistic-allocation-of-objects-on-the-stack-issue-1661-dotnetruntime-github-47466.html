          <h2>Background:</h2>
<p>It is always interesting to see the 2 points of view on a problem like this: "roslyn can optimize, and everyone would benefit" vs "We need a language guarantee because compiler optimisations are flaky, and sometimes can not make the assumption we would want to force them to (eg: nobody would argue that hints to force in-lining are not important). "</p>
<p>Variations of all the "what things can safely be left on the stack to make an operation non-allocating" set of discussions seems to be the primary place this occurs, and it often gets bogged down in escape analysis (eg: we can't do the above (stack alloc for local functions) for lambdas because we can't force a complaint implementation).</p>
<p>This is especially true when many of the things we take as part of the language itself are merely an implementation detail (eg: async x.ConfigureAwait(false) ).</p>
<p><em>Originally posted by <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/AartBluestoke/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/AartBluestoke">@AartBluestoke</a> in <a data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="360678826" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/1862" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/csharplang/issues/1862/hovercard?comment_id=573480509&amp;comment_type=issue_comment" href="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/1862#issuecomment-573480509">dotnet/csharplang#1862 (comment)</a></em></p>
<p>This is also partially a language request (as we would need either a new keyword, or attributes on local variables; some way to hint to the compiler that we'd like to "memory-inline" this 'new'). This issue is also vague about if the actual allocation is on the stack or in the local memory pool.</p>
<h2>Feature request:</h2>
<p>In cooperation from the runtime, request that objects be optimistically stored to the local memory pool.</p>
<p>for now this is a new keyword (compiled into an attribute) on a local variable</p>
<p><code>locallalloc var localList = new List&lt;int&gt;(); </code><br>
This is a request that the entire object for a local variable, be stored either on the the stack, or in the local memory pool. This isn't a recursive request, just for that specific 'new' call.</p>
<p>Once an object has been allocated locally it can be passed into any function. The issue is how to deal with "escaping" stack references.<br>
"escaping" in this context is defined as copying the reference to any heap allocated location.</p>
<pre><code>class c{
static IEnumerable sv;
{
localalloc var localList = new List&lt;int&gt;();
var x=localList ; // non-allocating, because x is a local
var doStuff(x); // the *function call* itself is not allocation, although any escaping assignment internal to would need to be.
sv = localList; // this is an escaping assignment, so is an expensive allocation and object relocation; 

var doOtherStuff(x); // has to pass the newly relocated memory location, not the original.
</code></pre>
<p>This is where the "Optimistic" part of this feature comes in. In a pay-for-play manner, escaping stack references are heap allocated on demand.</p>
<p>I think there are 4 places this could be done:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>promptly on object escape; as part of the execution of the line of code x=y.<br>
-- perhaps done by memory trap, but i'm not sure how to achieve this without increasing the cost of many different things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on return from the function when the local memory would be unwound potentially significantly later on return from the function with localalloc.<br>
-- This could be done via keeping a bitmap of localalloc objects that have 'escaped', and the 'escapees' and prior to function return requesting the GC relocate the object. this would hook into the concurrent mark+sweep component</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the next GC pass<br>
-- on return from a function that uses locallalloc, (and an object escaped?) the local memory section is not considered free until after the next GC gen0 pass. GC Gen 0 also considers any preserved local memory for object promotion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keep a separate section of the heap as a stack for the purpose of holding localAlloc objects - this would minimise the 'stack overflow' problem, as expanding the 'localAlloc memspace' could be done as part of a standard GC operation.<br>
-- i think this would be hard to implement in a backwards compatible manner, as the generated IL would have to change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no language, just runtime optimisation<br>
If this turns out to be cheap enough, then this could be a pure runtime issue, essentially making a new GC gen of -1 where all objects "known" to not survive can be optimistically allocated. I would propose that in this case all local variables optimistically assumed to be localloc and never escape.<br>
On a gen0 allocation those variables that escape are flagged, and the functions flagged for rejit (yes i know we currently never rejit, but here i want to; there are other use cases for this, optimising based on inlining of children recursively, devirtualization after rejit and code elimination within child calls, etc), removing the localAlloc hint.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>--<br>
Should this be over at csharplang first, as they would say 'can't do this without runtime assistance'?</p>
