It's samey, but it works very well. And by works, I mean results in higher conversions.</p><p>Part of it is a feedback loop. People can more easily use what they are familiar with, and designs people see a lot become familiar. This makes the most common design patterns more effective. More people use it because it's effective, which increases how many people are familiar with the design pattern.</p><p>This same loop applies for UX design in web and mobile apps too. If in doubt, it's a safe bet to use the most commonly accepted conventions. You end up with the same feedback loop. Sure, you can break the feedback loop and do something different, but is it worth the 20% drop in conversions?</p><p>At least with apps the functionality across the whole thing is usually different, meaning the way you use standardised components is more varied and interesting.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="t1_eh1b3v1" tabindex="-1"><div><div><p><span>level 2</span></p><div data-test-id="comment"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>Really unique websites:</p><p><em>Look how cool this looks!</em></p><p><em>But I don't know what I'm supposed to DO here...</em></p><p><em>Look how cool this looks!</em></p><p><em>Sigh...</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="t1_eh16syi" tabindex="-1"><div><div><p><span>level 2</span></p><div data-test-id="comment"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>I'd argue that this layout is becoming less effective the more that it's used. I've been to a couple websites with such a landing page recently and I can't remember a single detail of the people who were photographed for the background image, any of the links and what the company actually said. I bet that it was something about how "passionate" they are about their work.</p><p>All of the work that they put in became background noise to me because it's no longer chic and eye-catching. And it's surprising how some of these chic websites fail to work on mobile in 2019. I was viewing Triumph motorcycles website and trying to show my Dad a bike, but a UI element covered up half of the bike and there seemed to be no way to get the UI element out of the way.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="t1_eh1e9iy" tabindex="-1"><div><div><p><span>level 2</span></p><div data-test-id="comment"><p>Really it's just forms over data 95% of the time.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="t1_eh275i7" tabindex="-1"><div><div><p><span>level 2</span></p><div data-test-id="comment"><p>And increasingly software dev is just webdev wrapped in a crappy adaptor framework.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="t1_eh0sde4" tabindex="-1"><div><div><p><span>level 1</span></p><div data-test-id="comment"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>If you think this is all there is to web development, then odds are you're just code monkeying overglorified business cards over and over again.</p><p>Stop making websites like that then. Start building a portfolio of highly customized websites like <a href="https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov/</a> or <a href="https://40075.world/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://40075.world/</a> and learn some basic business skills, eventually you'll have clients who are willing to pay for sites like these. However, most web devs don't go that route because that requires actual skill and, more importantly, creativity.</p><p>EDIT from another comment:  most businesses don't need anything else. Often enough their website only serves to find their phone number or address. However there are plenty companies out there that create novel web apps. Many of which aren't even served through regular browsers. At my former workplace I contributed to a web app for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wqTYq3pD4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Bosch that's served on a digital signage solution</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="t1_eh0wgtr" tabindex="-1"><div><div><p><span>level 2</span></p><div data-test-id="comment"><p>That NASA page is way too cool</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="t1_eh0vsck" tabindex="-1"><div><div><p><span>level 2</span></p><div data-test-id="comment"><p>My notebook fans are now spinning at high speed.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="t1_eh1a73i" tabindex="-1"><div><div><p><span>level 2</span></p><div data-test-id="comment"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>People lampoon this design but as a business card it really fucking works and often the CTA leads to something much more interesting from a development perspective.</p><p>I could laden my site with unnecessary animations and pad it out with marketing content but I'd rather it be fast and serve its purpose.

I don't think you realise much time and money that NASA site would have taken to build. Many developers at agencies don't get a hand in the design concept and freelancers generally have clients with tight budget constraints, hence why they consulted a freelancer.</p><p>I say that as someone who has done both and now does product work building web apps. You're better off just going into product work than trying to convince client's they need to spend $30,000 for a site that takes 2 minutes to load.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="t1_eh0xywn" tabindex="-1"><div><div><p><span>level 1</span></p><div data-test-id="comment"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>I don't know what you mean by</p><p>&gt; This is why I'm planning to breakup with web and go for software.</p><p>I'm a web developer and I write web applications that are just as complex as any other applications, does this mean I'm not writing software?</p><p>If your job is writing HTML all day then perhaps it's time to do something more interesting (web apps, SPA's).</p><p>I don't know where people get the notion that other platforms are somehow any different.
