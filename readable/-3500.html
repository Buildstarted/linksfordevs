<p>If you've just come here to play&nbsp;one of the cooler story-mystery games in recent history, head to game developer Lucas Pope's <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/return-of-the-obra-dinn">website</a> as soon as you possibly can to download the first public demo of his new game, <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em>, for free on Windows and OS X.</p>
<p>We've been eagerly awaiting a chance to try the game again after enjoying its 15-minute demo at last month's Game Developers Conference. Pope's game-making reputation precedes him, thanks to his one-two punch of the touchscreen masterwork <em>Helsing's Fire</em> and Ars' choice for 2013&nbsp;game of the year <em>Papers, Please.</em>&nbsp;Still, we had no idea what to expect—especially from a new game so graphically rudimentary, it makes the lo-fi <em>Papers, Please</em> look like a piece of classic art in comparison.</p>
<p>"A lot of the work in making this game has been&nbsp;so that when a player&nbsp;sits down, they don't think immediately, 'why is this game in one-bit?'" Pope said to Ars during a GDC interview. "'I can't fucking see anything. Just give me more colors so I can tell what's going on. I don't care about the&nbsp;stupid art style.'"</p>
<p>Pope has pulled it off, however—and in stunning fashion. <em>Obra Dinn</em>'s demo starts with players pulling a rowboat up&nbsp;to an abandoned ship, which they board and walk around in search of treasure. The only thing on the ship, it turns out, is a crummy old&nbsp;pocket watch, but before getting off the ship, players come to realize that the&nbsp;watch can be used to discover ghost skeletons—and replay the moment in which each person died over a century earlier.</p>

Since these 3D, first-person-walking scenes are rendered in stark, one-bit fashion, players must walk around and closely examine the people in these frozen scenes to make out&nbsp;details such as faces, tattoos, clothes, and more.</p>
<p>The object of the game becomes clear toward the end of the demo: to record in a logbook exactly&nbsp;<em>how</em> everyone who was connected to this ship died (or whether they managed to outlast&nbsp;<em>Obra Dinn</em>'s most climactic moments). You'll have to keep tabs on all of the clues that come up and connect details that extend from one death vignette to the next. Names, relations, sounds, and visual cues will all play into answering for the deaths of more than 50 characters, and you'll need to answer some&nbsp;<em>specific</em> death questions to beat the game.</p>
<h2>“I really wanted to make a one-bit game”</h2>
<p>"The first inception of this game was the visual style," Pope told&nbsp;Ars. "I really wanted to make a one-bit game. What to do with that, I didn't know. I've made other games where you have to pay attention, notice visual differences, and make logical leaps between small clues and bigger solutions. That all led to the core mechanics of this game."</p>
<p>Pope has done an impressive job applying dithering and textures to his starkly painted world, which is rendered with only white pixels and black pixels, to make the death scenes look not only clear but emotionally charged. And the storytelling method reveals an&nbsp;approach that only a video game could pull off—one in which&nbsp;the plot must be uncovered and chained together by viewers, all while Pope really gets us into the heart of such tragedy and death with stark, frozen-frame scenes, along with a compelling script and solid voice-acting for at least this first taste.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet, and Pope says he still wants to come up with a cleaner system for how to assist players with connecting plot details and clues in the game's later portions, but for now, he says the game's core system is intact, and it's all been guided by his original lark to see if a one-bit game was possible. "[One-bit, low-resolution graphics] have&nbsp;been a really fun challenge for the game," Pope said to Ars. "One of the things I'm happier with."</p>
