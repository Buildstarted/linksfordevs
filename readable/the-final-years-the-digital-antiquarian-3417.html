This blogâ€™s good friend and supporter Brian Bagnall is in the home stretch now of his extended history of the late and lamented (?) Commodore Business Machines. <em>Commodore: The Final Years</em>, the third book in what has turned into a trilogy, is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1462758959/commodore-the-final-years-book?ref=cwibjn">entering its last weekend as a Kickstarter project</a>. Iâ€™m happy to say that itâ€™s already demolished its minimum funding goal, but more will help to make the book that much better, with color photos, an embossed cover, and other goodies.</p>
<p>Brian is doing a great service in recording aspects of computer history that would otherwise be lost forever. I know that researching, writing, and self-publishing a book like this one is a huge task, but if the last book is any guide itâ€™s one heâ€™ll handle with aplomb. If you havenâ€™t already, please think about joining me on the rolls of his backers!</p>
