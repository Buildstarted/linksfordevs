        <p>Every day, our data hits the market when we sign online. It‚Äôs for sale, and we‚Äôre left to wonder if tech companies will ever choose to protect our privacy rather than reap large profits with our information. But, is the choice ‚Äî profit or privacy ‚Äî a false dilemma? Meet the people who have built profitable tech businesses while also respecting your privacy. Fact check if Facebook and Google have really found religion in privacy. And, imagine a world where you could actually get paid to share your data.</p>

<p>In this episode, Oli Frost recalls what happened when he auctioned his personal data on eBay. Jeremy Tillman from Ghostery reveals the scope of how much ad-tracking is really taking place online. Patrick Jackson at Disconnect.me breaks down Big Tech‚Äôs privacy pivot. DuckDuckGo‚Äôs Gabriel Weinberg explains why his private search engine has been profitable. And Dana Budzyn walks us through how her company, UBDI, hopes to give consumers the ability to sell their data for cash.‚Äù</p>

<p>And, we‚Äôre pleased to add a little more about Firefox‚Äôs business here as well ‚Äî one that puts user privacy first and is also profitable. Mozilla was founded as a community open source project in 1998, and currently consists of two organizations: the 501(c)3 Mozilla Foundation, which backs emerging leaders and mobilizes citizens to create a global movement for the health of the internet; and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation, which creates Firefox products, advances public policy in support of internet user rights and explores new technologies that give people more control and privacy in their lives online. Firefox products have never ‚Äî and never will never ‚Äî buy or sell user data. Because of its unique structure, Mozilla stands apart from its peers in the technology field as one of the most impactful and successful social enterprises in the world. Learn more about Mozilla and Firefox at <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">mozilla.org</a>.</p>
