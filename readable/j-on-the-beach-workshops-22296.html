<p>Keeping state in memory is key to achieving high performance, but that is difficult in a distributed, scalable setting. Issues such as coordination, reconfiguration, and failures are problems which all reliable distributed systems have to deal with.</p>

<p>In this workshop, we will share patterns and technologies for building distributed, scalable applications.</p></div>

This can lead to severe security breaches and loss of your customers' data. Don't let that happen to you! You will learn how to apply current security best practices and you'll make an important step towards public-cloud-readiness and a future-proof "Zero Trust" architecture.</p>

<p>After the workshop you’ll have created a production-ready, secure and GDPR-compliant setup that you can easily build upon and extend. For that we’ll use the Identity Provider Auth0, Azure Functions and the secrets management system Azure Key Vault but the concepts can easily be applied to other vendors’ products.</p></div>
