<p>After the workshop youâ€™ll have created a production-ready, secure and GDPR-compliant setup that you can easily build upon and extend. For that weâ€™ll use the Identity Provider Auth0, Azure Functions and the secrets management system Azure Key Vault but the concepts can easily be applied to other vendorsâ€™ products.</p></div>
