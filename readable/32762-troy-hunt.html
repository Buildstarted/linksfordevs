I&apos;m a bit late with this week&apos;s update but I thought I&apos;d catch up with Scott Helme and do the video together. We&apos;re talking about the events in Vegas, the ongoing Project Svalbard process, some very screwy messaging about certificates from Sectigo and the Irish government coming on board HIBP. Next week we&apos;ll do another one from Vegas and talk about what the events of the week here were like. ReferencesSectigo made some pretty wild claims about EV certs (read the tweet thread by Scott)The subsequent rebuttals by David from Sectigo are worth reading (although they still don&apos;t justify the earlier claims IMHO)The Irish government is now using HIBP to monitor all their domains (they now join... <a href="/weekly-update-150/" class="article_link-more fa fa-long-arrow-right"></a> </p> </section> <footer class="post_tag"> <a class="tag" href="/tag/weekly-update/">Weekly update</a> </footer> </article> </p> <p class="article"> <article class="article_content wrap"> <header class="post_head post"> <time>03 August 2019</time> </header> <section class="article_text post"> <p>Over the last year and a bit I&apos;ve been working to make more data in HIBP freely available to governments around the world that want to monitor their own exposure in data breaches. Like the rest of us, governments regularly rely on services that fall victim to attacks resulting in data being disclosed and just like the commercial organisations monitoring domains on HIBP, understanding that exposure is important. To date, the UK, Australian, Spanish and Austrian governments have come onboard HIBP for nation-wide government domain monitoring and today, I&apos;m happy to welcome the Irish government as well. They now have access to all .gov.ie domains and a handful of other government ones on different TLDs.A big welcome to... <a href="/welcoming-the-irish-government-to-have-i-been-pwned/" class="article_link-more fa fa-long-arrow-right"></a> </p> </section> <footer class="post_tag"> <a class="tag" href="/tag/have-i-been-pwned-3f/">Have I Been Pwned</a> </footer> </article> </p> <p class="article"> <article class="article_content wrap"> <header class="post_head post"> <time>27 July 2019</time> </header> <section class="article_text post"> <p>What. A. Week.I&apos;ve been in San Fran meeting with a whole bunch of potential purchasers for HIBP and it&apos;s been... intense. Daunting. Exciting. It&apos;s actually an amazing feeling to see my &quot;little&quot; project come to this where I&apos;m sitting in a room with some of the most awesome tech companies whilst flanked by bankers in suits. I try and give a bit of insight into that in this week&apos;s video, keeping in mind of course that I&apos;m a bit limited by how much detail I can go into right now. As the process unfolds I&apos;ll share more, but hopefully this will give you a little taste of what I&apos;m going through at present.

That&apos;s off the back of the last week being focused on pushing out Pwned Passwords V5, loading several hundred million new records worth of new data breaches and finally launching something I&apos;ve been very excited about for a long time now: auth on the HIBP API.

My thinking at the time was that it would make the data more easily accessible to more people to go and do awesome things; build mobile clients, integrate into security tools and surface more information to more people to enable them to do positive and constructive things with the data. I highlighted 3 really important attributes at the time of launch: There is no authentication. There is no rate limiting. There is no cost. One of those changed nearly 3 years ago now - I had to add a rate limit.

Hopefully.

This wasn&apos;t so much an original work on my behalf as it was a consolidation of advice from the likes of NIST, the NCSC and Microsoft about how we should be doing authentication today. I love that piece because so much of it flies in the face of traditional thinking about passwords, for example:Don&apos;t impose composition rules (upper case, lower case, numbers, etc)Don&apos;t mandate password rotation (enforced changing of it every few months)Never implement password hintsAnd of most relevance to the discussion here today, don&apos;t allow people to use passwords that have already been exposed in a data breach.... <a href="/pwned-passwords-version-5/" class="article_link-more fa fa-long-arrow-right"></a> </p> </section> <footer class="post_tag"> <a class="tag" href="/tag/have-i-been-pwned-3f/">Have I Been Pwned</a> <a class="tag" href="/tag/pwned-passwords/">Pwned Passwords</a> </footer> </article> </p> <p class="article"> <article class="article_content wrap"> <header class="post_head post"> <time>05 July 2019</time> </header> <section class="article_text post"> <p>After a very non-stop Cyber Week in Israel, I&apos;m back in Oslo working through the endless emails and other logistics related to Project Svalbard.

On more positive news, the Austrian government came on board HIBP and my MVP status got renewed for the 9th time. I also wanted to talk this week about some of the stats from HIBP I&apos;ve been preparing as part of the acquisition.

But I also think that&apos;s the best way to earn any of the awards I&apos;ve since received; not by setting out with the award as the goal, but rather focusing on the activities for which the award is granted.

The Spanish government followed a few months later with each getting unbridled access to search their own domains via an authenticated API. As I explained in that initial post, the rationale was to help the departments tasked with looking after the exposure of their digital assets by unifying search and monitoring capabilities so the task could be performed centrally rather than having the effort replicated over and over again by individual departments. Before this effort, there were hundreds of gov domains being manually monitored by separate departments across those governments -... <a href="/welcoming-the-austrian-government-to-have-i-been-pwned/" class="article_link-more fa fa-long-arrow-right"></a> </p> </section> <footer class="post_tag"> <a class="tag" href="/tag/have-i-been-pwned-3f/">Have I Been Pwned</a> </footer> </article> </p> </div>
