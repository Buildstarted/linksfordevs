It’ll be available in just a few days on January 25.</p><p>Here’s an overview, along with a trailer:</p><blockquote><p>If you haven’t played it (you probably haven’t), SmuggleCraft is a stylized hovercraft racing game that includes local multiplayer, a custom track builder, and a quest based story-driven campaign. The race tracks are all randomly generated from beautiful alien terrain, so racing has more to do with quick reflexes than memorization.</p><p>Fans of SmuggleCraft have described it as “F-Zero meets Podracer”. It’s an aesthetically pleasing thrill ride that’s easy to learn but offers plenty of additional challenge for advanced players. Fans of future-racers will find plenty to keep them busy, with customizable crafts, a track editor, and rogue-lite mode.</p></blockquote><p>SmuggleCraft will normally cost $9.99. However, during its launch week, there will be a 70% discount on Switch. </p><p>Source: Happy Badger Studio PR</p><h3 class="jp-relatedposts-headline"><em>Related</em></h3></div></div></div></div>
