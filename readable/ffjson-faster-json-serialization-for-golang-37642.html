<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://github.com/pquerna/ffjson">ffjson</a> is a project I have been hacking on for making JSON serialization faster in the Go programing language.  <code>ffjson</code> works by generating static code for Go’s JSON serialization interfaces. Fast binary serialization frameworks like <a href="http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/">Cap’n Proto</a> or <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gogoprotobuf/">Protobufs</a> also use this approach of generating code.  Because <code>ffjson</code> is serializing to JSON, it will never be as fast as some of these other tools, but it can beat the builtin <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/">encoding/json</a> easily.</p>

<h2>goser</h2>
<p>The first example benchmark is <a href="https://github.com/pquerna/ffjson/blob/master/tests/goser/ff/goser.go#L18">Log structure</a> that <a href="http://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> uses.  CloudFlare open sourced these benchmarks under the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/goser">cloudflare/goser</a> repository, which benchmarks several different serialization frameworks.</p>
<p><img src="https://paul.querna.org/assets/posts/ffjson/goser.png"></p>
<p>Under this benchmark <code>ffjson</code> is <strong>1.91x faster</strong> than <code>encoding/json</code>.</p>
<h2>go.stripe</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/drone/go.stripe">go.stripe</a> contains a complicated <a href="https://github.com/pquerna/ffjson/blob/master/tests/go.stripe/ff/customer.go#L7">structure for its Customer object</a> which contains many sub-structures.</p>
<p><img src="https://paul.querna.org/assets/posts/ffjson/gostripe.png"></p>
<p>For this benchmark <code>ffjson</code> is <strong>2.11x faster</strong> than <code>encoding/json</code>.</p>

<p>If you have a Go source file named <code>myfile.go</code>, and your <code>$GOPATH</code> environment variable is set to a reasonable value, trying out <code>ffjson</code> is easy:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>go get -u github.com/pquerna/ffjson
ffjson myfile.go</code></pre></div>
<p><code>ffjson</code> will generate a <code>myfile_ffjson.go</code> file which contains implementations of <code>MarshalJSON</code> for any structures found in <code>myfile.go</code>.</p>

<p>At the last <a href="http://www.meetup.com/golangsf/">GoSF</a> meetup, <a href="https://twitter.com/fullung">Albert Strasheim</a> from CloudFlare gave a presentation on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/albertstrasheim/serialization-in-go">Serialization in Go</a>.  The presentation was great — it showed how efficient binary serialization can be in Go.  But what made me unhappy was how <strong>slow</strong> JSON was:</p>
<p><img src="https://paul.querna.org/assets/posts/ffjson/goser-benchmarks.png"></p>
<h2>Why is JSON so slow in Go?</h2>
<p>All of the competing serialization tools generate static code to handle data. On the other hand, Go’s <code>encoding/json</code> uses <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/reflect/">runtime reflection</a> to iterate members of a <code>struct</code> and detect their types. The binary serializers generate static code for the exact type of each field, which is much faster.  In CPU profiling of <code>encoding/json</code> it is easy to see significant time is spent in reflection.</p>
<p>The reflection based approach taken by <code>encoding/json</code> is great for fast development iteration.  However, I often find myself building programs that serializing millions of objects with the same structure type.  For these kinds of cases, taking a trade off for a more brittle code generation approach is worth the 2x or more speedup. The downside is when using a code generation based serializer, if your structure changes, you need to regenerate the code.</p>
<p>Last week we had a hack day at work, and I decided to take a stab at making my own code generator for JSON serialization. I am not the first person to look into this approach for Go.  <a href="https://twitter.com/benbjohnson">Ben Johnson</a> created <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/megajson">megajson</a> several months ago, but it has limited type support and doesn’t implement the existing <code>MarshalJSON</code> interface.</p>

<p>Go has an interface defined by <code>encoding/json</code>, which if a type implements, it will be used to serialize the type to JSON:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> Marshaler <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>MarshalJSON</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>byte</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> Unmarshaler <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>UnmarshalJSON</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>error</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As a goal for <code>ffjson</code> I wanted users to get improved performance without having to change any other parts of their code.  The easiest way to do this is by adding a <code>MarshalJSON</code> method to a structure, and then <code>encoding/json</code> would be able find it via reflection.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The simplest example of implementing <code>Marshaler</code> would be something like the following, given a type <code>Foo</code> with a single member:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> Foo <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
	Bar <span>string</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You could have a <code>MarshalJSON</code> like the following:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span>f <span>*</span>Foo<span>)</span> <span>MarshalJSON</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>byte</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>`{"Bar":`</span> <span>+</span> f<span>.</span>Bar <span>+</span> <span>`}`</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This example has many potential bugs, like <code>.Bar</code> not being escaped properly, but it would automatically be used by <code>encoding/json</code>, and avoids many reflection calls.</p>

<p>During our hack day I started by using the <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/">go/ast</a> module as a way to extract information about structures.  This allowed rapid progress, and at my demo for the hack day I had a working prototype.  This version was about 25% faster than <code>encoding/json</code>.  However, I quickly found that the AST interface was too limiting.  For example, a type is just represented as a simple string in the AST module.  Determining if that type implements a specific interface is not easily possible.  Because types are just strings to the AST module, complex types like <code>map[string]CustomerType</code> were up to me to parse by hand.</p>
<p>The day after the hack day I was frustrated with the situation.  I started thinking about alternatives.  Runtime reflection has many advantages. One of the most important is how easily you can tell what a type implements, and make code generation decisions based on it.  In other languages you can do code generation at runtime, and then load that code into a virtual machine.  Because Go is  statically compiled, this isn’t possible.  In C++ you could use templates for many of these types of problems too, but Go doesn’t have an equivalent.  I needed a way to do runtime reflection, but at compile time.</p>
<p>Then I had an idea. Inception: <strong>Generate code to generate more code.</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to keep the simple user experience of just invoking <code>ffjson</code>, and still generate static code, but somehow use reflection to generate that code.  After much rambling in IRC, I conjoured up this workflow:</p>
<p><img src="https://paul.querna.org/assets/posts/ffjson/flow.png"></p>
<ol>
<li>User executes <code>ffjson</code></li>
<li><code>ffjson</code> parses input file using <code>go/ast</code>.  This decodes the package name and structures in the file.</li>
<li><code>ffjson</code> generates a temporary <code>inception.go</code> file which imports the package and structures previously parsed.</li>
<li><code>ffjson</code> executes <code>go run</code> with the temporary <code>inception.go</code> file.</li>
<li><code>inception.go</code> uses runtime reflection to decode the users structures.</li>
<li><code>inception.go</code> generates the final static code for the structures.</li>
</ol>

<p>The inception approach worked well.  The more powerful <code>reflect</code> module allowed deep introspection of types, and it was much easier to add support for things like Maps, Arrays and Slices.</p>

<p>After figuring out the inception approach, I spent some time looking for quick performance gains with <a href="http://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs">the profiler</a>.</p>
<h2>Alternative Marshal interface</h2>
<p>I observed poor performance on JSON structs that contained other structures.  I found this to be because of the interface of <code>MarshalJSON</code> returns a <code>[]byte</code>, which the caller would generally append to their own <code>bytes.Buffer</code>.  I created a new interface that allows structures to append to a <code>bytes.Buffer</code>, avoiding many temporary allocations:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> MarshalerBuf <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>MarshalJSONBuf</span><span>(</span>buf <span>*</span>bytes<span>.</span>Buffer<span>)</span> <span>error</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This landed in <a href="https://github.com/pquerna/ffjson/pull/3">PR#3</a>, and increased performance by 18% for the <code>goser</code> structure.  <code>ffjson</code> will use this interface on structures if it is available, if not it can still fall back to the standard interface.</p>
<h2>FormatBits that works with bytes.Buffer</h2>
<p>When converting a integer into a string, the <code>strconv</code> module has functions like <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/strconv/#AppendInt">AppendInt</a>.  These functions require a temporary <code>[]byte</code> or a string allocation. By creating a <code>FormatBits</code> function that can convert integers and append them directly into a <code>*bytes.Buffer</code>, these allocations can be reduced or removed.</p>
<p>This landed in <a href="https://github.com/pquerna/ffjson/pull/5">PR#5</a>, and gave a 21% performance improvement for the <code>goser</code> structure.</p>

<p>I welcome feedback from the community about what they would like to see in <code>ffjson</code>.  What exists now is usable, but I know there are few more key items to make <code>ffjson</code> great:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Embedded Anonymous Structures:</strong> <code>ffjson</code> doesn’t currently handle embedded structures perfectly.  I have a plan to fix it, I just need some time to implement it.</li>
<li><strong>More real world structures for benchmarks</strong>: If you have an app doing high volume JSON, I would love to include an example in <code>ffjson</code> to highlight any performance problems with real world structures as much as possible. </li>
<li><strong>Unmarshal Support</strong>: This will require writing a custom scanner/lexer, which is a larger project.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any other ideas, I am happy to discuss them on the <a href="https://github.com/pquerna/ffjson">Github project page for ffjson</a></p></div></div></div>
