Despite the<br>best efforts of Browsers to ensure unambiguous requirements, there continue<br>to be issues with CAs and their understanding and successful implementation<br>of existing requirements. At present, due to the fact that validations may<br>be reused for up to 825 days, and when they are reused, may be used to<br>issue certificates valid for another 825 days, it may take up to four and a<br>half years before issues are resolved. This proposal would halve that time,<br>to a little more than two years, and represents a significant improvement.</li><li>Even when the Baseline Requirements are clear and unambiguous,<br>implementation issues by CAs routinely introduces risks of improperly<br>formed or validated certificates, allowing CAs to issue certificates which<br>have never been permitted and should never have been issued. Reducing<br>certificate lifetimes reduces the overall risk that the ecosystem is<br>exposed to these improperly formed certificates, both in terms of usage and<br>in the need for Relying Parties to support such certificates.</li><li>CRLs and OCSP have long been shown to be non-viable at Internet-scale,<br>in terms of how they externalize costs like privacy, performance, and<br>stability to Subscribers and Relying Parties. While alternative,<br>browser-specific methods also exist, they also allow CAs to externalize the<br>cost of their practices onto users and browsers, growing as the number of<br>unexpired certificates grow.  Reducing certificate lifetimes meaningfully<br>protects users, regardless of the revocation method used, and helps reduce<br>the overall costs paid by users.</li><li>Operationally, the current extensive certificate lifetime has<br>repeatedly led to issues, in that Subscribers frequently forget how or when<br>to replace certificates. Aligning on an annual basis helps ensure and<br>streamline continuity of operations, reducing the number of errors users<br>see and disruptions that sites face.</li><li>Operationally, the prolonged reuse of validation information creates<br>challenges in replacing certificates due to security risks identified with<br>the existing validation methods permitted by the Baseline Requirements.<br>Reducing this validity period similarly helps streamline the validation<br>process, allowing site operators to ensure for relying parties that the<br>certificates they use were meaningfully validated.</li><li>As shown by issues such as BygoneSSL, the misalignment between<br>certificate lifetime and the domain name system poses availability and<br>security risks to site operators. Despite such research being presented<br>directly to the CA/Browser Forum, there have been no efforts by CAs, as an<br>industry, to mitigate the risks posed to users. Certificate lifetimes<br>currently represent the greatest mitigation to these risks.</li><li>Existing certificate validity periods create risk for Relying Parties<br>wishing to enforce the Baseline Requirements or Root Program requirements,<br>by allowing CAs to “backdate” certificates in order to attempt to bypass<br>date-based program requirements. Reducing certificate lifetimes reduces the<br>window of exposure to such bypasses. As this has happened multiple times,<br>by past and present members of the CA/Browser Forum, reducing certificate<br>lifetimes represents the safest way to detect and counter this risk.</li></ul><p>While this ballot sets forward a proposal for an effective annual renewal<br>and annual revalidation, both periods should be seen as a starting point<br>for further improvements. In particular, multiple Browsers have noted that<br>the current reuse of domain validation information represents a substantial<br>security risk, and thus will seek to further reduce this in subsequent<br>ballots. In general, CAs and Subscribers are recommended to pursue<br>interoperable solutions for automation, such as RFC 8555, which allow for<br>easier and seamless validation and replacement of certificates, and thus<br>helping ensure users and Relying Parties are adequately secured.</p><p>While Browsers will be able to technically enforce these reduced validities<br>as early as April 2020, they will not fully benefit from the reduction<br>until 825 days after the last day such certificates can be issued, or June<br>2022. As a consequence, any further delays to the implementation period of<br>April 2020 would represent an even greater security risk to users and<br>Relying Parties.</p><p>This ballot further attempts to resolve ambiguities between the<br>expectations of Root Programs and the interpretations of CAs. Namely, it<br>attempts to clarify time periods in days and seconds, to avoid confusion<br>with respect to months, fractional seconds, leap seconds, and other forms<br>of date calculation, while also allowing an additional 86,400 seconds<br>between the recommended period and the required period. To address issues<br>with Validity Period, it defines the Validity Period in a way that can be<br>objectively technically enforced and verified, by measuring the period<br>between the notBefore and notAfter of certificates, as specified by RFC<br>5280. While historically the Forum has not specified timezones for<br>effective dates, and thus this ballot continues the trend, consistent with<br>the requirements of X.690, X.680, and X.509, the time and timezone for<br>effective dates shall be interpreted as midnight, Coordinated Universal<br>Time.</p><p>Changes since SC22 (V1)<br>(Informative) Redline:<br><a class="commit-link" href="https://github.com/sleevi/cabforum-docs/compare/0a72b35f7c877e6aa1e7559f712ad9eb84b2da12...sleevi:069f785ebbdc82b819dcd045330ce61542097158">sleevi/cabforum-docs@<tt>0a72b35...sleevi:069f785ebbdc82b819dcd045330ce61542097158</tt></a></p><p>This updates the date from March 2020 to April 2020. While the adoption of<br>this Ballot does not require functional or operational changes of<br>Subscribers for 18 months, and thus ample time to evaluate and prepare for<br>changes, concerns were shared that customers with freeze periods that last<br>through February may feel unprepared, particularly once the changes begin<br>to impact them in 2021. To account for this, an additional month of<br>breathing room is provided, allowing for approximately 19 months until any<br>organizational impact.</p><p>Prior to this change, there was a functional difference between the<br>Baseline Requirements' maximum information reuse period (835 days) and the<br>EV Guidelines' maximum information reuse period (13 months), although both<br>shared the same maximum Validity Period. The EV Guidelines included<br>provisions to allow for the issuance of additional EV certificates, subject<br>to the reuse period specified by the Baseline Requirements (Section<br>11.14.1), including issuing additional certificates with different keys<br>("rekey" or "re-issuance", Section 11.14.2). The alignment of the Validity<br>Period between DV, OV, and EV certificates, and the alignment of the reuse<br>of information between DV, OV, and EV certificates, renders this special<br>case unnecessary. To avoid confusion that may lead CAs to believe that the<br>EV Guidelines contradict or supercede the Baseline Requirements, which<br>could result from the special accommodations specific to the EV Guidelines,<br>Section 11.14.3 has been modified to reduce and resolve any ambiguity. This<br>attempts to be the smallest possible change, clarifying existing<br>expectations. All certificates, whether DV, OV, or EV, are subject to the<br>same information reuse period set forth in the Baseline Requirements,<br>including permitting a CA to issue additional certificates for additional<br>domain names, and without requiring additional validation for<br>organizational information.</p><p>An interpretation of the Bylaws has been put forward that voting cannot<br>start until an additional message is sent following the conclusion of<br>discussion; that is, that the may that is specified within the Bylaws is,<br>in fact, a MUST and a normative requirement. To avoid confusion or conflict<br>with such an interpretation, and until such a matter can be resolved by<br>Ballot, this v2 ballot does not specify a voting period start or end, and<br>will not do so until after the conclusion of (or modification of) the<br>discussion period.</p><p>The following motion has been proposed by Ryan Sleevi of Google and<br>endorsed by Curt Spann of Apple and Jacob Hoffman-Andrews of ISRG / Let’s<br>Encrypt.</p><p>----- MOTION BEGINS -----</p><p>This ballot modifies the Baseline Requirements, version 1.6.5, to<br>incorporate the following changes:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/cabforum/documents/compare/master...sleevi:069f785ebbdc82b819dcd045330ce61542097158?diff=split#diff-7f6d14a20e7f3beb696b45e1bf8196f2">https://github.com/cabforum/documents/compare/master...sleevi:069f785ebbdc82b819dcd045330ce61542097158?diff=split#diff-7f6d14a20e7f3beb696b45e1bf8196f2</a></p><p>This ballot modifies the EV SSL Certificate Guidelines, version 1.7.0, to<br>incorporate the following changes:<br><a href="https://github.com/cabforum/documents/compare/master...sleevi:069f785ebbdc82b819dcd045330ce61542097158?diff=split#diff-4d3fa7e751e9cac20a3014852be12e82">https://github.com/cabforum/documents/compare/master...sleevi:069f785ebbdc82b819dcd045330ce61542097158?diff=split#diff-4d3fa7e751e9cac20a3014852be12e82</a></p><p>Should this ballot be adopted, the Chair or Vice Chair shall be directed to<br>modify “SCXX” to “SC22” and “XX-Xxx-2019” within both documents’<br>informative tables to the date of the completed ballot, prior to or<br>following the IP Review Period, and “Xxxx XX” to the effective date/date of<br>publication of the Final Maintenance Guidelines.</p><p>In addition, the Chair or Vice Chair shall be directed to modify X.X.X<br>within both documents to an appropriate version, at the Chair or Vice<br>Chair's discretion.
