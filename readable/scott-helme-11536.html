	<p>There has been a huge focus on encryption on the web recently, with lots of that centred around HTTP with things like HTTPS and HSTS. Now we're taking the same concept and extending it to email with MTA-STS, or Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security.  MTA-STSYou can read about MTA-STS…</p>

	<p>With TLS having taken some great steps forwards in recent years, with TLSv1.2 in 2008 and TLSv1.3 in 2018, it's time to start dropping support for the legacy versions of TLS.  Legacy TLSTLSv1.0 was released in 1999, that's more than 20 years ago(!), and TLSv1.1 was…</p>

	<p>It's been an interesting ride over the last few years but HPKP, or HTTP Public Key Pinning, is finally coming to the end of its tenure. With support now gone in the last remaining browser, HPKP has been consigned to the scrap heap.  HPKPI first wrote about HPKP back in…</p>

	<p>Chrome has certainly been one of the main contributors towards the recent push to HTTPS online and without their contribution, I do find myself wondering how much progress would have been made. The Chrome team have just announced two more big changes coming soon and they will help push the…</p>

	<p>Everybody knows I'm a rather large fan of CSP and an even bigger fan of CSP reporting, but CSP can be hard. Part of my personal mission has been to make that easier and a lot of the tools and content I create are focused around that. To that end,…</p>

	<p>Personal like or dislike of EV aside for a moment, we can all agree on what the name of EV certs implies. Organisations get their company details in the certificate and CAs have to do some extended validation of that data compared to a normal certificate. Turns out, that doesn't…</p>

	<p>We've made some great progress in the TLS and PKI ecosystem in recent years, driven largely by the actions of browser vendors. We could have just taken another step forwards with Ballot SC22 at the CA/B Forum, but too many CAs voted against the ballot.  The CA/B ForumFor…</p>
