                        In this article we are discussing Azure Managed Identities!
                        <br>
                        Why is it a good idea to use them?
                        <br>
                        How can they help make access to Azure resources more secure and less error-prone?
                        </p><p>

                        They can significantly improve authentication process between cloud resources, reduce operational overhead and vulnerability of managing and storing authentication credentials.

                        It is convenient in case the consumer has stopped reading events and needs to continue from the exact point it left off earlier, or we might want to start consuming all events that were produced not earlier than a certain point in time. In this article we will learn how to have more flexibility around the starting point of consuming streams in Spark Structured Streaming. Previously, I wrote how we can...

                    <p>
                     In this article, we are going to set up a data ingestion system and connect to it from Spark to consume events to do further processing. As an example I’ve chosen to use Twitter data as a source, because it is freely available to anyone who creates a <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new" tagret="_blank">Twitter App</a>, and new data comes in real-time...

                    </header>
                    <p>What is the benefit of running a distributed database on Kubernetes? Time it takes to create a Kubernetes cluster with a distributed database on it is just few minutes. Same to destroy the cluster. It can take a long time to properly set up a bare metal cluster, or even a VM one, which is less flexible. If using a containerized distributed database, it can significantly reduce costs spent on clusters for development and testing, because the cluster doesn’t have to exist when unused and it provides more flexibility.

               </header>
               <p>When working on a distributed system with many moving parts and diverse platforms, there is always need to have an easy way to manage your system altogether. Azure provides a way to use well known and proven orchestrators: Kubernetes, DC/OS, Docker Swarm. If your services need to be adjustable, Azure Container Service (ACS) is a right tool with a lot of flexibility. It is possible to create an ACS cluster using Azure Portal in the UI. There are many options to set up an ACS cluster in an automated, repeatable, or immutable infrastructure paradigm, and we will go through them in this article.

               <p> Recently, Azure introduced Azure Container Instances and Web App for Linux and Containers. It makes it easier to host applications for more diverse application stacks. Azure Container Instances is the fastest way to deploy containers on Azure, because instead of building an underlying VM, ACI just assigns an existing VM to the container. It can also work with Kubernetes through an experimental ACI to Kubernetes connector...<br>

               Recently there are a lot of conversations about whether you can or can't be a good .NET engineer, or Java engineer, or whatever other engineer. The word "good" means different things to different people. We can always look at this question from many different perspectives and the answer can be yes and no.

                  If you're a good Architect, you can figure out the most reasonable architecture for some specific system at some specific point of time, based on known priorities. The major problem is - there is no general perfect architecture. Industry, science and business are moving forward fast as a light-speed rocket, so does technology. In the era of data all over the place, technologies and frameworks are polishing themselves, offering new innovative approaches. The moment will come when you have to make changes to the architecture that used to be perfect, and it's not bad - we just have to be armed and ready for that...

                  When I asked the question on twitter about what problems people see in current way of F# development and growth.. one of the answers was: "Enterprise people who think C# is the best and only the best are a problem ;) But I wouldn't know how to reach them...". So I will try to express my thoughts on this topic here.
