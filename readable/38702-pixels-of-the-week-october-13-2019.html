    <h1>Pixels of the Week &#x2013; October 13, 2019</h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>Every week I share a list of curated articles, resources and tools about UX, UI and mobile design, HTML, CSS, the web industry, process inspiration and more&#x2026;</p><p>This week&#x2019;s selection: a color palette tool, accessibility in the news, responsive screen size map, an ebook on design systems for developers, iOS 13 and PWAs, typography and text rendering, UX and animations, an article trying to explain the crappy interface we still have today, etc.</p><h2>#Now &#x2013; what I&#x2019;m up to</h2><p>Yesterday I gave a workshop on cognitive biases with my friend Laurence at Parisweb.

The card deck is in French for the moment but I might translate it back to English some day.
