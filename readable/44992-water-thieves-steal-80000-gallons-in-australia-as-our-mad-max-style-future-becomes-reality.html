And with record-breaking heat and bushfires getting even larger, it feels like Australia is living in the future. That future, unfortunately, looks a lot like <em>Mad Max</em>.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">Police in New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, report that a farmer in the small town of Evans Plain had about 80,000 gallons of water (300,000 liters) stolen from his property, according to the <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 idsfNL js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/300000-litres-of-water-stolen-from-droughthit-community/news-story/af8a0b02d303c16c34c9258b93533ad7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/300000-litres-of-water-stolen-from-droughthit-community/news-story/af8a0b02d303c16c34c9258b93533ad7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Australian</em></a></span> newspaper.

Just a couple of weeks ago, thieves in the small town of Murwillumbah stole about 6,600 gallons (25,000 liters) of water, enough to fill about six or seven fire trucks, according to <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 idsfNL js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/tens-of-thousands-of-litres-of-water-stolen-in-northern-nsw-20191212-p53jgx.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/tens-of-thousands-of-litres-of-water-stolen-in-northern-nsw-20191212-p53jgx.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local authorities</a></span>. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">And it all feels like something out of a <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 idsfNL js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d605rM0U3x0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d605rM0U3x0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sci-fi dystopia</a></span>, where battles over water are fought to sustain a meager existence.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">Australia is reeling from extreme heat this week, breaking temperature records for the <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 idsfNL js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://earther.gizmodo.com/australia-just-set-a-new-heat-record-1840506655&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/australia-just-set-a-new-heat-record-1840506655">past three days</a></span>, and reaching an average maximum temperature of 40.9 degrees Celsius (105.6 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, 41.9 degrees Celsius (107.4 degrees Fahrenheit) on Wednesday, and 40.7 degrees Celsius (105.2 degrees Fahrenheit) on <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 idsfNL js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/finger-pointed-at-climate-change-as-heatwave-smashes-records/11817884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/finger-pointed-at-climate-change-as-heatwave-smashes-records/11817884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thursday</a></span>.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">“We’re smashing the extremes by effectively a degree relative to the other cases because that’s by how much the Australian temperatures have warmed,” climate scientist David Karoly told the <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 idsfNL js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/finger-pointed-at-climate-change-as-heatwave-smashes-records/11817884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/finger-pointed-at-climate-change-as-heatwave-smashes-records/11817884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC</a></span> on Friday. “Climate change has contributed between 1C and 1.5C on top of the natural variability.”</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">And it’s not just the heat.
