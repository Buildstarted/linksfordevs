<p>
In addition to these, there are a number of other new features and changes - but in this post, we want to focus mainly on the major changes to keep the release notes to a digestible length. For those interested, the changelog and git history have a more complete list of all changes.</p><p>

Most of these changes are aimed at developers. These release notes are intentionally verbose to inform current contributors and developers, as well as to catch the interest of potential future hashcat contributors.</p><hr>
<p>
Major Feature: Plugin Interface</p><hr>
<p>
One of the first things you will notice after unpacking the new hashcat version is the new modules folder. We have had modularity in mind for a long time, and have finally managed to implement it: each and every hash type is separated into its own module. This not only makes the code much easier to read, write, and maintain, but it also comes with a very nice new architecture, interface, and added flexibility.</p><p>

In essence, this is actually just some overdue refactorization, but it comes with a lot of benefits for developers working on new hash types: it makes it much easier to write new host code (including parsers, decoders, encoders, hooks etc). The hash type code is 100% separated from the core code, meaning that there's no more need to edit the hashcat core sources to add a new hash type. This also enables much easier distribution of custom kernels which have not been pushed to the main repository.</p><p>

During more than four months of "conversion" of the old hash types, we designed a new common interface and made all existing hash modes work with this new plugin interface. We even created a new testing framework, and converted all the old testing modules. See the tools/test_modules/ folder for more information.</p><p>

A huge thanks to everyone helping to convert hash types and/or tests for these new interfaces. This has not only shown us that the new interface works great and is flexible enough to cover all the different needs from the different modules, but it also shows that contributors are able to easily write modular code.</p><p>

The new fully modularized hash-type integration makes the hash-type-specific code more compact and encapsulated, but also maintains and even adds flexibility. For instance, it is now possible to easily add hash-mode specific JiT (just-in-time) compiler flags which are used at kernel compilation runtime, or easily mark hash-mode specific unstable warnings on some specific setups (for instance depending on driver and hardware). One could easily add new restriction and limitations directly to the module, without cluttering other parts of hashcat (to avoid "spaghetti code" and "special cases" everywhere).</p><p>

There is a lot to say about this new architecture that we've designed and we could go into much further detail, but we will do our best to not go too far here. Fortunately, for everybody interested, we also wrote a hashcat plugin interface guide for developers. This guide is the first official "how to add a new hash type" document, it already consisting of almost 20,000 words. It does not cover every detail, but it gives you everything you need to get started adding your own hash type. </p><p>

Be prepared, because reading will take a bit of time. You can find it here: <a href="https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/docs/hashcat-plugin-development-guide.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/...t-guide.md</a></p><hr>
<p>
Major Feature: Backend Interface</p><hr>
<p>
Similar to the Plugin Interface feature, it took us quite some time and effort to refactor how we deal with supporting different compute devices in hashcat. </p><p>

As you will notice, we have changed many command line parameters to --backend-* as replacements of the old --opencl-* parameters. The reason for this is that hashcat now has a more flexible architecture for how we deal with different backends (like CUDA/OpenCL etc). With this system, we can add additional backends in an elegant way whenever we may need to in the future.</p><p>

The system is designed in such a way that backend-specific code is abstracted away from other operations (like loading the kernel source code etc) and uses a common interface which makes the code much more readable and easy to use.</p><hr>
<p>
Major Feature: CUDA Support</p><hr>
<p>
This is basically an "application" of the new Backend Interface feature. With the new architecture for hashcat backends, we were able to start supporting CUDA for NVIDIA devices. By NVIDIA devices, we mean any of their compute devices that support CUDA, not just discrete GPUs! This enables hashcat to run on chips such as the NVIDIA Jetson or NVIDIA Xavier. This also enables us to utilize CUDA on platforms where NVIDIA does not release a driver capable of OpenCL, including ARM platforms and IBM POWER9 platforms.</p><p>

There are several other advantages that CUDA has over OpenCL on NVIDIA devices, but the most important one is that the entire amount of GPU memory in a single block allocation can now be unlocked by the user by installing the CUDA Toolkit.</p><p>

We recommend (at the time of this writing) installing the CUDA Toolkit without the NVIDIA driver it ships with and install the latest/recommended driver from nvidia.com instead. Hashcat will actually warn you if you have an NVIDIA device, but "only" use the OpenCL driver, because you <span>should</span> install the CUDA Toolkit for CUDA-supported devices. This step is mandatory if you want to use CUDA instead of OpenCL backend because there's no JiT compiler for CUDA the way how it comes already built-in for the OpenCL with the NVIDIA drivers.</p><p>

Hashcat will list all the devices (CUDA devices in addition to OpenCL devices) with --backend-info (short: -I) and you can easily select the devices you want with --backend-devices (short: -d). Of course, hashcat prefers the "CUDA devices" if available! (and for the curious reader: no, you can't actually use OpenCL and CUDA at the same time for the same device in hashcat - we call this an alias. The speed will NOT double this way :P)</p><p>

One of the biggest advantages of CUDA compared to OpenCL is the full use of shared memory (sometimes also called Local Memory). In OpenCL, there's a minimum of 1 byte reserved by OpenCL which has bigger implications than may be apparent at first. For example, most NVIDIA cards have 48kb of shared memory. To efficiently compute bcrypt, each thread requires 4k of this shared memory pool. This means that on CUDA we are able to use 12 threads on bcrypt instead of just 11 threads with OpenCL. This and other optimizations are the reason we improved the performance of bcrypt by 46.90%.</p><hr>
<p>
Major Feature: Emulation Mode</p><hr>
<p>
This feature is basically introducing a very nice way to use kernel code within modules or host code. We came up with this strategy for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>For complex kernels with lots of code, it's easier to debug the code on the host side as a standalone project. This also saves long startup times and increases development speed.<br>
</li>
<li>Reuse complex kernel code from within the module. A good example is WPA EAPOL/PMKID, where we compute the last steps in the module parser with the goal to find already cracked hashes in the potfile. This saves maintaining the same code on two ends.<br>
</li>
<li>Reuse kernel code in order to precompute values in parsers. As a very easy example, consider some "flawed" algo that uses md5($salt) within the algorithm. In this case we could just precompute this MD5 in the host. <br>
</li>
</ul><p>
The "emulated" code is basically shared between the OpenCL/CUDA code and the host code and can, for instance, be directly included by the module (for instance src/modules/module_19100.c includes emu_inc_hash_sha256.h). This way we also avoid duplicated code and guarantee that the host code also uses the most optimized code.</p><p>

It is actually quite easy to use for developers. For an example of some basic hashing algos being used directly in modules with this new emulation mode, just take a look at existing modules (like -m 19100 as mentioned above) or glance at the include/emu_*.h files.</p><hr>
<p>
Major Feature: Memory/Thread Management</p><hr>
<p>
Lastly, a feature that is less directed at hashcat devs/contributors, but is still interesting and very important when it comes to performance: improvement in memory and thread management to reach maximum performance.</p><p>

Hashcat 6.0.0 introduces a new way that threads and device memory (VRAM) are used and optimized: with the addition of a new automatic workload tuner, we try to guarantee maximum performance depending on the available memory, hash type, attack mode, amplifiers (e.g. rules) etc. We basically changed the thread management from a "native" thread count for GPU to maximum possible threads. We've also added a command line parameter: --kernel-threads (short: -T) if you want to play with this and set the amount of threads manually.</p><p>

This obviously comes with a very nice performance gain depending on hash type, attack mode etc.</p><hr>

Changelog Technical:</p><hr>
<ul><li>Backend Interface: Added new options --backend-ignore-cuda and --backend-ingore-opencl to prevent CUDA and/or OpenCL API from being used<br>
</li>
<li>Binary Distribution: Removed 32-bit binary executables<br>
</li>
<li>Building: On macOS, switch from ar to /usr/bin/ar to improve building compatibility<br>
</li>
<li>Building: Skipping Travis/Appveyor build for non-code changes<br>
</li>
<li>Codebase: Cleanup of many unused rc_* variables<br>
</li>
<li>Codebase: Fixed some printf() format arguments<br>
</li>
<li>Codebase: Fixed some type casting to avoid truncLongCastAssignment warnings<br>
</li>
<li>Codebase: Moved hc_* file functions from shared.c to filehandling.c<br>
</li>
<li>Codebase: Ran through a bunch of clang-tidy checkers and updated code accordingly<br>
</li>
<li>Codebase: Remove redundant calls to fclose()<br>
</li>
<li>Dependencies: Updated LZMA-Headers from 18.05 to 19.00<br>
</li>
<li>Dependencies: Updated OpenCL-Headers to latest version from GitHub master repository<br>
</li>
<li>Hash-Mode 12500 (RAR3-hp): Allow cracking of passwords up to length 64<br>
</li>
<li>Hash-mode 1460 (HMAC-SHA256 (key = $salt)): Allow up to 64 byte of salt<br>
</li>
<li>Hash-Mode 1680x (WPA-PMKID) specific: Changed separator character from '*' to ':'<br>
</li>
<li>Hash-Mode 8300 (DNSSEC (NSEC3)) specific: Allow empty salt<br>
</li>
<li>Keep Guessing: No longer automatically activate --keep-guessing for modes 9720, 9820, 14900 and 18100<br>
</li>
<li>Keep Guessing: No longer mark hashes as cracked/removed when in potfile<br>
</li>
<li>Kernel Cache: Reactivate OpenCL runtime specific kernel caches<br>
</li>
<li>Kernel Compile: Removed -cl-std= from all kernel build options since we're compatible to all OpenCL versions<br>
</li>
<li>OpenCL Kernels: Fix OpenCL compiler warning on double precision constants<br>
</li>
<li>OpenCL Kernels: Moved "gpu_decompress", "gpu_memset" and "gpu_atinit" into shared.cl in order to reduce compile time<br>
</li>
<li>OpenCL Options: Removed --opencl-platforms filter in order to force backend device numbers to stay constant<br>
</li>
<li>OpenCL Options: Set --spin-damp to 0 (disabled) by default. With the CUDA backend this workaround became deprecated<br>
</li>
<li>Parsers: switched from strtok() to strtok_r() for thread safety<br>
</li>
<li>Requirements: Add new requirement for NVIDIA GPU: CUDA Toolkit (9.0 or later)<br>
