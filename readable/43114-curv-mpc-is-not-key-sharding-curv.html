It is clear to many individuals and institutional players that <strong class="gv hh">MPC is the next generation for securely storing and managing digital assets by eliminating the single point of failure associated with private keys.</strong></p><p id="8412" class="gt gu cm at gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg ec">Over the past year, the acronym MPC has been adopted by numerous solutions trying to enter the wallet space. However, many of them are actually utilizing other methods such as Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing Scheme (often called key sharding) instead of using Multi-party Computation protocols to protect the transaction. In this post, we explain the differences and how they may affect wallet security. <strong class="gv hh">Clients should be aware of the right questions to ask their providers to understand the risks to which they may be exposed and how to differentiate one from another.</strong></p><h2 id="506e" class="hi hj cm at as ce hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu">What is Key Sharding?</h2><p id="31c8" class="gt gu cm at gv b gw hv gy hw ha hx hc hy he hz hg ec">Key sharding is a method by which a private key for a wallet is first created, and then divided into pieces (shards) and distributed to multiple machines or users. Those shards are then reconstructed every time a signing operation takes place to recreate the private key and then use it to sign the transaction. There are many security challenges with this approach as it does not eliminate the fundamental attack vectors associated with private keys in the first place.</p><p id="a182" class="gt gu cm at gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg ec">If an attacker infiltrates the part of the system where the private key is being used, they might very well be able to pick up on the entire private key at the moment of its creation and then again when it is recombined for signing. Once the key is compromised, an attacker can use it to steal any funds associated with the wallet.</p><p id="25ac" class="gt gu cm at gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg ec">So to be clear, creating a private key and distributing it across multiple parties is not a multi-party computation process. It is a security practice designed for data at rest but faces significant operational and security challenges for use in the digital asset market.</p><h2 id="0985" class="hi hj cm at as ce hk hl hm hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu">What is Curv MPC?</h2><p id="5dd1" class="gt gu cm at gv b gw hv gy hw ha hx hc hy he hz hg ec">MPC eliminates the private key from the process completely. A private key is never created in the first place nor is it recombined to sign a transaction. Instead of creating a private key and then distributing it to the different parties, each party independently generates their own random and non-disclosed variable. Those independent variables are never known to any other party and MPC guarantees that when they are used in the secure protocol to sign a transaction no party can ever learn anything about the variables that were generated by the other participants.</p><p id="c0b7" class="gt gu cm at gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg ec">While that might seem insignificant, it actually changes the risk profile dramatically. Once there is no longer dependence on a single, permanent key, the variables used for signing transactions can be constantly rotated. Like sharding, the cryptographic material is still distributed over multiple machines, but unlike sharding there is no single attack vector for an adversary as data sitting on any one machine has no inherent value. And again, a key is never created or recombined, so there is no point at which the adversary can compromise the signature process in any way.</p></figure></div></div></div></div>
