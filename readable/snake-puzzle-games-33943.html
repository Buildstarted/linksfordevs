        <p>Here is a collection of all the snake-themed puzzle games in the known universe, complete with descriptions, pictures, and a few awards.  The order in which they appear is roughly the order that I played them in.  The purpose of this article</p>

<p>My main qualification to write about these games is that I have solved all the puzzles.  In describing them, I have sometimes left out key mechanics or high points, so that the reader will not lose the joy of discovery.  If you find that I have erred too far to the side of spoiler avoidance, don‚Äôt tell me!</p>

<h3 id="snakebird-by-noumenon-games"><a href="https://snakebird.noumenongames.com/">Snakebird</a> by Noumenon Games</h3>
<p>The most well-known of the snake puzzle games, and for good reason. The mechanics are deep and intriguing, and the game is well polished, with good levels and some of the best graphics of any 2D puzzle game. The main novelty is combining snake movement with gravity, and it also has growth by eating fruit, and the ability to individually control multiple snakebirds.  My favorite trailer/video of Snakebird is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77d9xVIsoHc">this one</a> (warning obscene language), which might be funniest if you watch after playing a few levels first.  There is also an in-depth <a href="http://www.electrondance.com/tail-meets-head/">article</a> by ElectronDance about his experience playing through Snakebird.  Snakebird has great puzzles that reward planning ahead, and visualizing the shapes you will need to make in order to solve them.  Its difficulty catches some by surprise, as the visuals look playful and benign.  It‚Äôs not the hardest of the games here but it‚Äôs one of the harder ones.  Overall it gets a very high recommendation!  The creation of the game is discussed by its developers <a href="http://noumenongames.com/snakebird-development-images-and-history/">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea came from misunderstanding how a game by a friend worked. My friend only linked screenshots and never actually described how it played, so when it later turned out that his game was in fact a platformer and not actually a snake game with gravity like I had thought I made a prototype to show him. The prototype was then sort of forgotten about and it would take about a year before we dug it up and started turning it into a proper game.<br>

<p>A newer game from the makers of Snakebird that uses the same mechanics, designed as an easier version that will be accessible to many more people.  The game remains fun and charming with the simpler levels, and you would be hard-pressed to find someone that wouldn‚Äôt enjoy it.  It‚Äôs quite a bit easier than the original, so for those who have completed the original game this might not feel like it adds much.</p>

<h3 id="snakebird-for-gameboy-by-freeball1"><a href="https://fb1.itch.io/snakebirdgb">Snakebird for Gameboy</a> by freeball1</h3>
<p>A remake of Snakebird done by a friend of the designer, strangely made for Gameboy.  It comes with 10 original levels clothed in retro graphics.  The new levels are well designed, are on average a bit more challenging than the original Snakebird, and have a clearly different puzzle style as well.  The lack of an undo button can sometimes get annoying, but is overcome with a bit of patience.  Based on a quick Google search, I ended up using the <a href="https://openemu.org/">openemu emulator</a>, and it worked well.  Definitely recommended if you like Snakebird.</p>

<h3 id="snakefall-by-thejoshwolfe-and-contributors"><a href="https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/snakefall/wiki">Snakefall</a> by thejoshwolfe and contributors</h3>
<p>There are three fan remakes of Snakebird that were built specifically to have a level editor.  Snakefall was developed by thejoshwolfe and is the most successful of the three.  There are by far the greatest number of levels built in Snakefall (73 at the time of writing), and they are the hardest of all snakebird levels made.   One new thing in this version that is not present in any other Snakebird variant is one-segment snakes.  Try out how these work in the first level, <a href="http://wolfesoftware.com/snakefall/#level=3tFRIoTU&amp;17&amp;29?*z0*10*11*I0111000111*K03*z0*z0*R03*701*704*003*701*E0122*002211122*00221*401110*910111*z0*M0/s0?323&amp;322&amp;351/s1?43/s2?101&amp;102&amp;131&amp;160&amp;159&amp;158&amp;129&amp;100/">Disabilities Act</a>!  The hardest level sets are by XeroOl, Gooby, and Teal Knight, while an easier but still interesting set of 3 was made by Cookie.</p>

<p>The overall quality of levels designed in Snakefall is surprisingly high, with only a few uninteresting levels in the whole mix.  Stand-out levels include (in order of appearance in the wiki): <a

      <td>There is an <a href="https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/snakefall/wiki/Experimental">experimental</a> section in the wiki, with a few new mechanics introduced. The first and main one is a type of platform that allows snakes to move up through it, but not down - a snake is supported on the platform by any of its outside edges.

<p>The second reimplementation of Snakebird, this time in PuzzleScript.  Terzalo programmed it and made one level for it, and a few others have made some levels for it.  The editor that can be used to make levels is <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html?hack=6bb3b2a7430f6d30c171">here</a>.  The first level made is Terzalo‚Äôs single <a href="http://terzalo.com/avis-anguis/">demo level</a>, which is large and demonstrates all of the mechanics from the original game.  Connorses made two levels, <a href="http://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=fad47a69f1c9fe4511fd">here</a> and <a href="http://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=284511950fad837b6cdf">here</a>. The first level is novel and interesting, and the second more standard.   I think the best is this <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=eb24626adb36ffee89ae">set</a> of three levels by CHz.  The first two are on the easier side while the third is challenging and quite nice.

<p>One of Rosden Shadow‚Äôs game-a-day that he kept up for a remarkable 87 days, it‚Äôs short but unique.  Your snake picks up segments like usual, except these segments block the snake‚Äôs movement more than in regular snake.

<blockquote>
  <p>I would have chosen to use a snake game to use as a puzzle game because I was working with every little idea I could think of. I chose to have the goal to collect all the orbs and having the orbs extend the snake and create walls because when it comes to snake games most of them are about navigating through or avoiding the wall/body that get in the way by your own movements and those mechanics worked towards enhancing and taking advantage of that effect.<br>

<h3 id="ouroboros-eggs-by-marcos-donnantuoni"><a href="https://marcosd.itch.io/ouroboros-eggs">Ouroboros‚Äô Eggs</a> by Marcos Donnantuoni</h3>
<p>A game where your snake lays eggs if it makes a loop around empty space, and each puzzle asks you to lay a certain number of eggs in the given terrain.  As with many of Marcos Donnantuoni‚Äôs games, the puzzles here were procedurally generated, though you might not have been able to tell based on just the level design.  It‚Äôs an interesting take on snake puzzles, certainly feeling different and worth trying.  There is variety in the solutions, but maybe not quite enough to justify the large number of puzzles in the game.  There are two other puzzles game by different authors that are about catching your tail, but both were abandoned in the work-in-progress phase: In <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=10346416">Ouroboros</a> by Connorses, the only goal is to catch your tail. This is made nontrivial by having more complex maps, but it ends up feeling like mostly trial-and-error. <a href="https://grogge.itch.io/ouroboros">Ouroboros</a> by Grogge adds some lock &amp; keys, and blocks that mimic your snake‚Äôs movement.  Your tail stays put, so it feels more like the exit is coincidentally where you start, rather than chasing your tail. Unfortunately it also seems to add at least one major bug.  Overall Ouroboros‚Äô Eggs is by far the most interesting exploration of the idea.</p>

<p>If you are interested in other procedurally generated puzzle games, Marcos has made many other good ones ‚Äì my favorites include <a href="https://marcosd.itch.io/always-with-the-magnets">Always With the Magnets</a>, <a href="https://marcosd.itch.io/seq-o-ban">Seq-O-Ban</a>, and <a href="https://marcosd.itch.io/dispontibus">Dis Pontibus</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://joelthefox.github.io/img/OuroborosEggs.png" alt="Ouroboros eggs"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ouroboro‚Äôs eggs uses a mechanic that I planned to use in a larger game, which was going to contain several mythological serpents, each with different powers that manifested differently. In particular, the Ouroboros activates its power (laying eggs to reproduce) each time it closes in a loop, biting herself.
This is an interesting topological idea, but constricting it to a grid made it a little more simplistic than I wanted to achieve. However, I was able to generate some interesting levels.
In particular my favorites are those where laying the required amount of eggs is very straightforward, but the challenge is to do it in a way that allows you to get out of the burrow.<br>

<h3 id="snakehole-by-jack-kutilek"><a href="https://jackkutilek.itch.io/snakehole">Snakehole</a> by Jack Kutilek</h3>
<p>Snakehole is a very interesting take on snake puzzles. As you might have guessed, there are ‚Äúholes‚Äù that play a big role in the mechanics. Exactly how, you‚Äôll need to find out for yourself! It only has 8 levels, but each one is large and meaty.  It is also has some of the nicest visuals in a PuzzleScript game (I guess the bar is low, but it‚Äôs pretty hard to make 5x5 pixels look as good as they do in this game).  This is one of my favorite snake games on this list, since it has both creative mechanics and good levels.  I found a neat modification to level 7 that makes it harder, which you can try <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=2569c0d26a4331cffc7efaa9df88607c">here</a> (with permission from the designer. Naturally one should only attempt this after beating the game. I make no claim that my level is better than the original).</p>

<p><img src="https://joelthefox.github.io/img/Snakehole.png" alt="Snakehole"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Snakehole spun out of a discussion about how you might implement snake-like movement in puzzlescript. I put together a quick demo, and once I had a nice snake of course I needed a crate to push around. I was interested in symmetric objects and mechanics, so of course the crate needed to be a snake, too. I introduced the hole as a way to get through tight spaces with a long snake, and I continued adapting its uses as I needed more mechanics for my level designs. I also used this game to practice pacing - inspired by the sequencing technique described in ‚ÄòEvery Frame a Painting‚Äôs video on ‚ÄòF for Fake‚Äô, I designed multipart levels with alternating and developing themes. The goal of this was to create frequent, structured variation in gameplay while the full consequences of the mechanics are explored and shared with the player.<br>

<h3 id="snakeoban-by-jack-lance"><a href="https://jacklance.itch.io/snakeoban">Snakeoban</a> by Jack Lance</h3>
<p>This wonderful PuzzleScript game is not well known, but the puzzles are fantastic.  The mechanics involve controlling a snake on a flat plane and eating apples to grow, very similar to the original snake.  The big difference is that in addition to eating all the apples, your goal is to place boxes on all the targets (hence the ‚Äúoban‚Äù in the name, referring to the Sokoban genre).  There are a couple of extra twists that come later, which I won‚Äôt spoil.  This is one of the best PuzzleScript games out there, and it gets quite challenging in later levels.  A few times I thought ‚Äúah, this must be the crowning puzzle of the game!‚Äù and was mistaken.  The penultimate level is one of my favorite sokoban puzzles ever.  Note, the itch version linked here contains many more levels than earlier iterations of the game had, in case you‚Äôve played it before.</p>

<p>This game is like Snake in that you have to eat all of the food, but your snake has infinite length so it‚Äôs all about picking everything up without retracing any steps.  The puzzles in dotsnake tend to be quite simple.  Mechanically, it‚Äôs actually identical to one of the puzzle types in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/">The Witness</a>. This author also made another snake-like game, <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=83015ef216bfdc4ca86bbc9f44b254fa">Jormungandr</a>, but it was abandoned in an unsolvable state.

<p>A game where your tail stays put, and you need to eat enough to extend your body until you are able to reach your tail with your head.  The graphics are nice and the music is soothing.  Most of the puzzles are quite straightforward.  Once you understand the rules, you can press ‚Äòend‚Äô to skip some of the early levels that I think are too straightforward.  The basic mechanics don‚Äôt really suggest a snake theme, but when multiple snakes are added it makes more sense.</p>

<p>A snake game where the main difficulty is restricted controls. Rather than being able to move freely in all 4 directions, you can only press left or right.  The exact results of those button presses are left as an exercise to the player.  The goal is to cover all the target squares.  The alpha version has a shorter snake, while the main version has longer snakes and few more levels. The two versions of the game don‚Äôt overlap, so you can play either of them or both.  It‚Äôs interesting, but takes a bit of time to get used to not being able to move in the direction you want to (at first it feels rather annoying!).  <a href="https://st33d.itch.io/the-fuse">Fuse</a> is another nice puzzle game from this author.</p>

<p>An interesting snake game with gravity, where you need to eat all the apples but your snake grows with every move, not only after consuming fruit.  The most common maneuver is to climb on your own body to reach greater heights, but there‚Äôs a lot more to it than that.  It‚Äôs a longer game with many interesting levels, and adds two mechanics as the game progresses: locks and keys, and one that you might guess but I won‚Äôt reveal.</p>

  <p>Lime Rick is actually pretty much an improved remake of my older game ‚ÄúI

keeping the time limit in mind I wanted to keep the concept as simple as
possible and put the most of effort on making the puzzles interesting and
compelling. I love coming up with challenging puzzles so after completing
the game I started coming up with new levels. I felt that the original
self-replicating straight-faced main character was somewhat awkward, so
when upgrading the visuals a forever growing snake felt like a natural
choice and the goal was changed to a red apple as in classical snake
games.<br>

Snake Escape is described as being based on Lime Rick, with a modified design including making the original hard levels harder, and adding 4 new extra hard levels at the end.  I went through both games side by side, and can list out the pros and cons of this edition.</p>

<p>Pros: More interesting graphics; original music (Lime Rick didn‚Äôt have music); levels 9 and 30 are made harder and more interesting; 4 new levels at the end (these are about the same difficulty as the later levels in Lime Rick).<br>
Cons: Need an emulator; no undo button; level 26 is easier and less interesting; on my machine at least, movement was slower (brief delay between key presses).<br>
In order to play I used the Fuse emulator. To get the music running, select 128k machine in the options. The controls seem to be left = O, right = P, up = Q, restart = space.  The levels are generally modified to be on a smaller grid, to make room for the more interesting graphics of each tile. Most levels turn out to have basically the same solution as in Lime Rick, with the exceptions noted above.  Although the mechanics and most levels are derived from Lime Rick, it has the blessings of Lime Rick creator Tommi Tuovinen (which I personally confirmed).</p>

<p>Bas de Reuver had an interesting idea to expand the game, which he demonstrated in a short prototype called <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=c4bf7294719b246686a456cd00e89b74">Snake Escape 2</a>, but it didn‚Äôt catch.</p>

<p>This short game could be separated into two parts for the two unconventional weapons. The first weapon is a snake gun, which shoots out a snake that travels until it hits an obstacle (and then can move in another direction). Use it to kill zombies! A fun little game that still poses a challenge.</p>

<h3 id="boa-by-steven-miller"><a href="https://steven-miller.itch.io/boa">Boa</a> by Steven Miller</h3>
<p>A neat snake game that feels like somewhat like an adventure since the levels are large.  Puzzles are a bit hit-and-miss; some puzzles are nice and some less interesting.  Adds several adventure-like mechanics, which I won‚Äôt spoil all of. One mechanism that works quite well though is ‚Äúfalling,‚Äù where your snake needs to be on top of at least one land tile in order to not fall. This is like a 2D plane version of falling in Snakebird, which worked very well.  Since none of the puzzles are too hard, the game is relatively short.</p>

<p><img src="https://joelthefox.github.io/img/Boa.png" alt="boa"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boa was my first puzzle game, and it often shows through odd pacing and difficulty drops.  It was created for MiniLD 63, the theme for which was to take a classic game and give it a twist.  I went with snake on a whim.  At that point, I hadn‚Äôt seriously played sokoban or its variants, so the mechanics were pulled from more casual games.  As it was my first foray into the genre, it wasn‚Äôt very well thought out, resulting in somewhat awkward gameplay.<br>

<h3 id="snake-trail-by-steven-miller"><a href="https://steven-miller.itch.io/snake-trail">Snake Trail</a> by Steven Miller</h3>
<p>In this game you control both a snake and a square, and the snake is used as a raft to assist the square in moving around and pushing things. Nice idea! Not too many puzzles but the later ones are good.</p>

<p><img src="https://joelthefox.github.io/img/SnakeTrail.png" alt="snake trail"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Snake Trail was my attempt at a game where the snake increased the freedom of player movement.  I had somewhat recently played Snakebird, so I wanted to try something with snakes again, but I wasn‚Äôt too fond of how restrictive the snake character is.  Instead of having the snake segments clutter the movement space, I made it part of the movement space.<br>

<h3 id="crate-snake-by-steven-miller"><a href="https://steven-miller.itch.io/crate-snake">Crate Snake</a> by Steven Miller</h3>
<p>An interesting snake game where you need to push crates onto targets (like ‚ÄúSnakeoban‚Äù), but here your snake can wrap around the screen (using torus topology).  Some of the puzzles are not that tight, in the sense that target squares could have been put in different locations without changing the solution too much. It‚Äôs still pretty fun though.</p>

<p><img src="https://joelthefox.github.io/img/CrateSnake.png" alt="crate snake"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The next snake game I worked on was Crate Snake.  At the time, I was experimenting a lot with different movement mechanics, one of which was screen wrapping.  The idea was to have the character‚Äôs length restrict movement but have the screen wrapping compensate by allowing more ways to avoid getting stuck.  I was unhappy with the result and I actually abandoned the project for a while despite it being almost done.  I released it almost 6 months later for the Finally Finish Something jam nearly unchanged.<br>

<p>These three games above were made by Steven Miller, whose best game I think is <a href="https://steven-miller.itch.io/vampire-garden">Vampire Garden</a>, a fantastic, deep puzzle game that has nothing to do with snakes.  He also made another game called Snake Blocks that I am not reviewing only because he has a major overhaul planned.  I expect it will be very good!</p>

<h3 id="snake-maze-by-zilverphoenix"><a href="https://zilverphoenix.itch.io/snake-maze">Snake Maze</a> by ZilverPhoenix</h3>
<p>Does feel very much like a snake maze - how do I escape from this labyrinth of walls, buttons, and doors? - and the 10 levels in the base game are mostly interesting.  Because the mechanics are basic, the main one being sitting on buttons with any part of your snake in order to open doors, the difficulty comes from having a lot of things to keep track of in the level. Manages to still be good overall though, and the levels are well designed.  There is a bonus level pack of 10 extra levels, which is described as being more difficult and experimental, though I found the difficulty and style to be not far off the base 10 levels.  I did slightly prefer the design of the extra levels, some having more open areas and other interesting geometries.</p>

<p><img src="https://joelthefox.github.io/img/SnakeMaze.png" alt="snake maze"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was thinking of different existing games and how their mechanics could be extended upon, one such game being Snake. The idea of a snake pressing buttons just came to me, and since I couldn‚Äôt find any games that used this mechanic, I decided I must create it myself. I think the idea was great but I acknowledge that my sadistic level design and lacking amount of additional mechanics scares many players off.<br>

<p>Each of the segments of your snake are different symbols in this twist on snake games, and you need to match the segments to target squares on the ground.  Also, instead of having your tail block movement as in most snake puzzles, here you can eat yourself, resulting in rearrangement of the symbols. A fresh feeling game with really good level design that keeps things small and elegant. It was done for a Ludum Dare with the theme ‚Äúyour life is currency‚Äù and this game fit the theme incredibly well!  If you already played the Ludum Dare version, I recommend replaying the whole game, as most of the levels have been redone and are of much higher quality now.  I will also mention that Le Slo made <a href="https://le-slo.itch.io/flockoban">Flockoban</a>, which is a wonderful puzzle game though there are no snakes.</p>

<p><img src="https://joelthefox.github.io/img/TailoftheSerpent.png" alt="tail of the serpent"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The theme of the jam was ‚ÄúYour Life is Currency‚Äù, I wanted to avoid classic interpretations so I spent most of the first day thinking. The string to pull was: a snake that pays with his body, at that moment it could be enemies with patterns, switches and doors or a weird metroidvania. Experimenting with eating your own body and leaving the tail behind pushed me to make this a puzzle game, so I spend most of the second day migrating everything to my level editor. At the end I was still confused by the eat yourself mechanic, levels were a bit random and wasn‚Äôt completely pleased with the general difficulty. Laying at night, looking at the floor, the push mechanic appeared to me and I decided ‚ÄúI need to add this tomorrow morning to the game‚Äù before falling asleep, I was glad the system surprised me that way. That caused having little time the third day to design levels, especially with the eat yourself mechanic, because I already explored it a bit.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I‚Äôm actually very happy with the result (not only the system but the aesthetic and music), I managed to make in 3 days a coherent game. I replayed it a couple of times and started finding unintended solution and redundancy between levels, of course. I gave me the 3 weeks of rating games to redesign the puzzles, finding new ideas (wow, new ideas! I couldn‚Äôt believe it) and fixing a couple of bugs. Although I‚Äôm pleased with the new levels, I think I messed up a bit the level order (classic!) and nowadays I would permute a couple of the levels. I believe that this is the game I made with the highest puzzle-theorem rate in spite of puzzle-example and I hope in the future I come up with ideas like this, that doesn‚Äôt only puzzle the players during their playthroughs but surprise me while making them. Ah, and I absolutely love level 25, it‚Äôs the best level I ever designed. [editor‚Äôs note: by puzzle-theorem he means a puzzle that requires a new discovery or insight to solve, as opposed to a puzzle-example which is an application of something already learned]<br>

<h3 id="snakes-tale-by-michael-fairley"><a href="https://m12y.com/a-snakes-tale/">Snake‚Äôs Tale</a> by Michael Fairley</h3>
<p>Nice graphics and a good set of mechanics.  The objective in each puzzle is to get a specific snake to a goal, while other snakes (that you also control) get in the way.  Several more mechanics are introduced later, and they complement each other quite well (pressure plates, eggs to eat and grow, different terrain, and more).  The puzzles themselves are on the easier side but many are interesting.  Controls were surprisingly natural when played on android.  The author wrote an extensive post-mortem blog article <a href="https://michaelfairley.com/blog/a-snakes-tale-postmortem/">here</a>.</p>

  <p>I spent some time thinking about what sorts of puzzles could be made with snakes on a grid, and something Rush Hour-like stuck out to me as a decent choice, so I started building out some levels for it and was pretty happy with the direction it was headed. I had also played Snakebird a year or so before (and loved it), and while I didn‚Äôt consciously think about it that early in the project, I‚Äôm sure it was a subconscious influence on me.

<p>A brilliant, difficult game where you are a little mouse that gets stuck inside a snake skeleton‚Äôs skull.  Mechanically, the novel idea is that you can move backwards and attach vertebrae to your skeleton.  The challenge of each level is figuring out how to place boxes on buttons, similar to the snakeoban games, but the backwards motion really adds a lot more complexity than you would first imagine.  There are a remarkable number of original concepts explored throughout, with each level presenting a new idea.  If you like hard puzzle games, this is one of the all-time best.</p>

<p>NB: Ali recently made a significant update to the puzzles in the game.  If you played it prior to August 2019 I would recommend playing again from the start.  Disclaimer - I helped a bit with the update.</p>

<p><img src="https://joelthefox.github.io/img/Vertebrae.png" alt="vertebrae"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Okay, so this game‚Äôs mechanics is based on two what-if questions applied to snake mechanics; first ‚ÄúWhat if trying to move backwards did something?‚Äù and also ‚ÄúWhat if moving onto your body did something other than kill you?‚Äù The rest followed from there, with little adjustments being made here and there and other simple mechanics being added to enable making puzzles with the main mechanics.<br>

<p>An old (2006) game with basic rules: red dots make you grow, try to eat them all and reach the exit door.  It has eight levels, and the puzzles work but are not that exciting. This is the oldest game on the list! (though only because the original Wriggle puzzles are currently out of commission)</p>

<h3 id="snake-slider-by-bas-de-reuver"><a href="https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-snake-slider">Snake Slider</a> by Bas de Reuver</h3>
<p>Snake Slider is a 2D snake game where you control both neutral snakes and a special green snake, and the goal is to get the green snake to the exit.  The premise is similar to A Snake‚Äôs Tale above, and this ends up being much like a harder version of that game.  Unlike most snake games, you can move snakes by either the head or tail in this game.  The head is still slightly different in that you can eat apples from that side.  This game is also similar to Wriggle (see below), with a few added mechanics, such as eating apples and growing.  I believe they were developed independently, though Snake Slider came out after the original Wriggler idea by Andrea Gilbert, which was in 2003.  Both were inspired by Rush Hour.</p>

<p>Snake Slider uses a move counter, and a side goal is to find the optimal solution to each puzzle.  This tends to be a divisive mechanic, as finding optimal moves generally puts more focus on brute-force logic than other types of puzzles do.  However, I found the goal to work well in this game.  All uninterrupted movements of a single snake are counted as one move, so efficient maneuvering is key.   Finding the optimal solutions to the late puzzles gets to be quite hard.  I think the game will still be interesting if you ignore finding shortest solutions, though the difficulty curve will become more variable.  Works very well on mobile (both Android and iOS, as it‚Äôs run on mobile browser).</p>

<p><img src="https://joelthefox.github.io/img/SnakeSlider.png" alt="Snake Slider"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I initially created Snake Slider as a freeware Windows game in 2005. Direct inspiration was the Rush Hour puzzle game with the little plastic cars. I wanted to create a Rush Hour game except with trains that could bend, but quickly realised using snakes would be better. When the iPhone was released, I figured it was a good fit for the game because of the touch screen. I created 2 iPhone apps of this game in 2011, a free demo and paid version. Especially the free demo version was downloaded a lot, if I remember correctly at one point it was around 8000 downloads per month.  Ultimately I had to pull the app from the App Store as it was making less money than the developer program annual fee.  Again later in 2016 I ported the iPhone version as a Javascript webversion which was published by coolmath games.  The best thing about the iPhone/web version is the really beautiful graphics, they were created by a professional company based only on some crude stick figure drawings I sent via mail.<br>

<p>Wriggler Demake should really be considered a ‚Äúpuzzle game inspired by Wriggle,‚Äù but I suppose the author was being humble about their creation.  This game is similar to Wriggle in that there are multiple snakes on a grid that can be dragged from either end, and the goal is for all the colored tiles to have that color of snake on top of them (this is the same as the original Wriggle rules. The creator of Wriggle later changed the goal to be an exit square, as in Wriggle 3D).  One difference is in the way the player controls movement using a pseudo-cursor, which I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere else.  The game is short and well done, and will be worth looking at if you enjoy the types of puzzles in Wriggle or Snake Sliders.

<p>The <a href="http://www.clickmazes.com/wriggle/ixwriggle.htm">original Wriggle puzzles</a> (the game is not currently playable, but the designer is working to update the website to fix it) by Andrea Gilbert from 2003 I think is the very first snake puzzle game!  It was initially created as a variation of sliding block puzzles of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)">Rush Hour</a> variety.  In Rush Hour, vehicles can only move by their front and back, along the line defined by their long end.  This variant relaxes the movement ‚Äì the front and rear of the objects are the only parts that can lead, but instead of moving just in a straight line, they can move in any direction and the rest of the object will follow in a snake-like way.</p>

<p>The extra flexibility in movement is countered by walls that block movement, to make puzzles that do feel quite a bit like Rush Hour, giving the same feeling of ‚Äúhow do I ever clear my path to the exit.‚Äù  I think this is a step up, being more fun and deeper than Rush Hour.  Deeper in the sense that for the same difficulty of puzzle, the solver will need to think more conceptually and strategically in this game.  Like in Snake Sliders, the secondary goal is to solve each puzzle in the fewest moves (again counting a move as dragging the end of a snake by any distance).  This proves to be quite a tough challenge, on par with Snake Sliders.  There are many really interesting puzzles in the game, the final one being exceptionally nice.</p>

<p>Wriggle 3D comprises the same 80 puzzles that were present in a now defunct mobile app called Wriggle. I find the graphics, music, and controls work well.  It is currently only available for Mac.</p>

<p>A Hamiltonian Path style puzzle game, similar to Shy Snake above, where you try to visit each square in the grid once with your snake.  There are a few twists, including locks and keys, bombs, and more, which add some fun to a sometimes mundane genre.  The puzzles are generally good, though some of them are further towards the trial-and-error side of things than I would like.  Lacks an undo button, which you may find objectionable.  Although there are a lot of puzzle games of this type, not all of which I really consider snake games, this one was interesting and snake themed, so I have included it.  See the excluded games discussion below for a number of similar puzzle games that did not make it to the main list.</p>

<p><img src="https://joelthefox.github.io/img/FillerSnake.png" alt="fillersnake"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wanted a game that had less of a repeating arcade feel and more of a 
puzzle feel. Mostly because I wanted to put more of my creativity in 
making puzzles itself. This game was inspired by other games with 
similar game-play but built upon by adding new concepts (mostly through 
the tile interactions). I believe most players like playing games that 
have ‚Äúlife‚Äù in it, so I made the main tile be a character with eyes. 
Using a snake character felt the most appropriate given the game-play.<br>

<p>SnakekanS is a fantastic iOS game that starts with the basic snake idea, where you need to eat all the animals and then reach the exit, and adds different animals that have special mechanics.  The first special animal you encounter is the frog, which changes the direction of your snake when you eat it.  Such a simple idea with such great potential!  I found the other animals also interesting, though none change the game quite as much as frogs.  The level design is also very well done, the final puzzle being particularly memorable.  Before getting comfortable with all the mechanics it can feel like some puzzles are too open-ended, having not enough direction and resulting in a lot of trial-and-error, but with time you gain the ability to spot the central ideas in each puzzle better, and are able to think through the level without as much testing.  Graphics and sound are very pleasant, and controls work well.</p>

<p>Quetzalcoatl is an iOS game that draws on the original Wriggle mechanics, where you want colored snakes to lie on specific tiles according to their color.  Quetzalcoatl makes the win condition more flexible by allowing colors to be applied to specific segments of snakes rather than entire snakes.  The game has 180 levels, that I feel is somewhat influenced by a push for quantity in iOS games in general.  I think the game would have been more enjoyable for me if the number of levels was cut down, but some may like that you can use similar techniques on increasingly difficult problems, honing your skill.  The puzzles are grouped by difficulty, including <em>easy</em>, <em>medium</em>, <em>hard</em>, and <em>ultimate</em>.  The last set of puzzles is indeed challenging, sometimes requiring insightful solutions and sometimes requiring good old hard work.  There is generally quite a bit of variety in the style of puzzles.  Some are claustrophobic ‚Äúhow do I swap these snakes in such a tight space‚Äù puzzles, while others are expansive levels where an appreciation of the overall geometry is key.  The touch controls work extremely well, and the art is nicely colorful.</p>

  <p>When we started to work on this game in 2014 we wanted to create a puzzle with snakes and colours. With this idea in mind, everything came very easily to us: a grid with coloured tiles, snakes with coloured dots, drag the snakes to match the colours. We made a quick and dirty prototype in about one hour just to validate the principle. We realised that it has a huge potential for many different levels. Then we developed a level editor (a private iOS app) and we started to work on the puzzles (everything is handmade). At the same time, we also worked on the game itself, designing the graphics and the sound effects. The minimalist graphics kind of reminded us of aztec symbols, so we wanted to name the game Quetzalcoatl (the feathered Serpent in Aztec mythology). We hesitated a lot because this word is very difficult to spell, but we didn‚Äôt find a better name and we got used to it.<br>

<h3 id="snake-blocks-by-spooky-cat"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/339320/Snake_Blocks/">Snake Blocks</a> by Spooky Cat</h3>

<p>Snake Blocks is a game about connecting pairs of colored points in 3D space, where one point is the start of that color of snake and the other point is its destination.  This is like a 3D version of the familiar 2D pen and paper puzzle ‚Äì connect pairs of points using lines without crossing.  The 3D snakes can support themselves in the air (as long as any part of it is touching the ground), meaning that the order in which you draw out the snakes doesn‚Äôt matter. I think it might have been more interesting if it worked similar to Lime Rick, where every segment of a snake needs to be supported against gravity.  There is an added constraint that each snake can only grow to a certain maximum length.  It can be a bit tough to get the snakes to go exactly where you want them to using the cursor controls, but I didn‚Äôt find it too annoying.  The puzzles provide a good exercise in thinking in three dimensions, and can be fun but at times also have a bit too much trial-and-error.</p>

<h3 id="sniks-by-shelly-alon"><a href="http://www.shellyalon.net/sniks/">SNIKS</a> by Shelly Alon</h3>

<p>In SNIKS, like in Quetzalcaotl, the goal is to have each colored square (here represented by colored fruit that you temporarily ‚Äòeat‚Äô) be matched by that color of snake on top of it.  The big twist in this game is that snake segments (but not heads) of different snakes can overlap, which makes it feel quite fresh.  There are additional mechanics common to many snake games, like teleporters and things that make you grow in length.  There is also a mechanic in world 4 that will be familiar to players of other types of puzzle games, but which has never been tried in a snake game before.  It works surprisingly well!  The music and graphics are nice, but the controls feel a little slow at times.  The puzzles in SNIKS focus equally on determining the end-state of the puzzle and on maneuvering to get there, while in Quetzalcoatl the focus is more on the maneuvering.  This game also distinguishes itself in having a large variety of mechanics to play with, whereas the variety in Quetzalcoatl comes more from its different puzzle geometries.</p>

<p>Snake Sokoban Spiral is similar to Tail of the Serpent in that the goal is to match snake segments to symbols on the ground. One idea added in this game is that segments get stuck to their ground markers for 1 turn, which allows for rearranging segments but can also make things trickier. The next addition is the ‚Äúroll‚Äù move, which works somewhat how you‚Äôd expect it to and definitely shakes things up. A short game with new ideas, interesting levels, and also some rough edges.</p>

  <p>Around the time of development I was frequently deconstructing various puzzle games and taking note of the individual actors, their states and the rules between them. It was fun to paper prototype games with a small amount of actors that maximize the state they can be in.<br>
LD45 was starting. It was around 1 in the morning. The theme was ‚ÄúStart With Nothing‚Äù and nothing exciting came to mind for a few hours. I recalled seeing a game by Lucas Le Slo titled ‚ÄúThe Tail of the Serpent‚Äù on a stream a while ago. Feeling defeated, I attempted to sleep on the idea of making a snake game. It wasn‚Äôt long before I started thinking of a design that had more actor states than actors.<br>
Instead of sleeping, I booted up my editor and messed up my sleep for the rest of the jam. I think it very clearly shows: Some of the levels have unintended solutions. The difficulty curve at the very start has a very unwelcome spike. I even neglected to think that the snake pieces should mirror their direction after being rolled!<br>
For the 48 hours it took me, I was happy with the game when I had called it done. Now having all this behind me, I can‚Äôt help but be reminded of Chris Hecker‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlease Finish Your Game‚Äù rant from GDC 2010.<br>

<p>ENIGMASH is the Frankenstein‚Äôs monster of puzzle games. Patching together different puzzle themes within individual puzzles, and then connecting those puzzles together in a single world, it‚Äôs a marvel of PuzzleScript code and puzzle design. Whether Snakes appear in it is unknown. Perhaps I am including a game <em>without</em> snakes so that the next time I add a game with surprise snakes to my snake article, nobody will see it coming.</p>

<p>Snakey Jakey is a snake that doesn‚Äôt like to follow the rules of physics. In Snakebird you can defy physics by pushing snake A with snake B, even if snake B requires snake A‚Äôs body to push off of. Jakey takes this a step further by being able to push <em>himself</em>. There are a couple of other new things expanding on that idea that you‚Äôll discover in later chapters of this PuzzleScript game. The movement feels strange initially, but you get the hang of it quickly and the experience is interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This game started out as a way to take a break from my current big project. I‚Äôve played my fair share of snake puzzle games, including many of the games on this article. For this game, I conceptualized a snake game where the snake could push itself.<br>
In the <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=7ebb5b49505d2e8fc7897a501a639c6e">original prototype</a>, the snake sort of pivoted its tail when it pushed itself. This was really unintuitive, and extremely difficult to program. So, I changed the rules to make pushing yourself be a lot simpler, and it immediately became much more intuitive, was easier to program, and had a lot more puzzle potential. After that, it was pretty easy to make the rest of the game!<br>
I‚Äôm happy with how this game turned out. If I ever need a big project that isn‚Äôt too big, then it might be nice to remake this game into a full-fledged browser game. Of course, I‚Äôve learned that I shouldn‚Äôt make promises when it comes to sequels, but it‚Äôs definitely a possibility!<br>

<p>The style of game where you need to touch all the squares in a room without revisiting any square is sometimes themed as a snake game.  Formally this type of puzzle is equivalent to finding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path">Hamiltonian Path</a> in a graph, except when there are mechanics in which order matters (like the bombs in Filler Snake), or other oddities like touching multiple squares at once in Shy Snake. The original Hamiltonian Path puzzle is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour">Knight‚Äôs Tour</a>, invented back in the 9th century!</p>

<p>There are several other games of this type that I did not include ‚Äì the list is long enough already. Here is a quick list of some that I found:</p>

<p>Alcazar was the most popular implementation of this type of puzzle game, but is unfortunately no longer available. Edderiofer wrote a couple of interesting <a href="http://edderiofer.blogspot.com/search/label/Alcazar">blog posts</a> about techniques in these types of puzzles.<br>
<a href="https://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/puzzle/ham/">Hamiltonian Mazes</a> changes connectivity from the regular square grid.<br>
<a href="https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Grand-Tour/">Grand Tour Puzzles 1</a> includes required path segments<br>
<a href="http://glenniba.com/grandtourhexbranch/GrandTour.html">Grand Tour Puzzles 2</a> is currently down because it relies on java applets<br>
<a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/carlospedroso/fillall">Fillall</a> has crossings and a type of lock &amp; key.<br>
<a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=dead21bf09bebb91c128eb27629affcb">Filler</a> has sliding tiles, crossings, portals.<br>
<a href="https://linemaze.gameindy.com/en/">Linemaze</a> seems very similar to how Alcazar was, in appearance and mechanics (I don‚Äôt know about puzzle quality but it‚Äôs unlikely to be as high).<br>
<a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/dyarosla/overlink">Overlink</a> plays on a 3D surface.<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/661430/LineWay/">Lineway</a> looks pretty, and has merged tiles, directional tiles, and some other things.<br>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/line-master-puzzle/id1450932322">Line Master Puzzle</a> has lock &amp; key, crossings, direction tiles.<br>

<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snakes-and-apples/id655078064">Snakes and Apples</a> adds apples to pick up in a specified order.<br>
<a href="https://mozz.itch.io/fill-the-world-with-your-rainbow">Fill the world with your rainbow</a> adds blocks to push around (though it‚Äôs a very short game).<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/932290/Mochi_Mochi_Boy/">Mochi Mochi Boy</a> defies description.<br>
<a href="https://nora-sellisa.itch.io/snek-konnekt">Snek Konnect</a> has a snake but no added mechanics.</p>

<p>There are some games that used the same mechanics as Snakebird or Wriggle without mentioning their inspiration, and without new ideas. With Snakebird it seems very likely that the mechanics were copied, while with Wriggle it‚Äôs possible that other developers just hadn‚Äôt known about it. <a href="http://www.whalefoodgames.com/too-many-snakes">Too Many Snakes</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trupuzzle/id430437507">TruPuzzle</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twisted-snake/id840047572">Twisted Snake</a> have the same mechanics as Wriggle, but came after Wriggle did.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/yfan/choo-choo-puzzles">Choo Choo Puzzles</a> is like Wriggle on a hex grid, but also with pushing.  It does feel a bit more like moving vehicles around than snakes, but it‚Äôs a good concept.</p>

<p>Almost a puzzle is <a href="https://hempuli.itch.io/chnakess">Chnakess</a>, a snake + chess combination where you try to eat all the chess pieces.  The pieces will escape your bite if they can move without being blocked by your tail, and if they have multiple options they choose somewhat arbitrarily. This makes it feel slightly more like an arcade game than a puzzle, but it‚Äôs worth checking out.</p>

<p><a href="https://siivergoid.itch.io/slime-path">Slime Path</a> is a game about slimes which probably would have made it if it had snake graphics. You control multiple slimes that act like infinite snakes, with some added mechanics like lock &amp; keys, and you need to get all slimes to their exits.</p>

<p><a href="https://egordorichev.itch.io/snackzzle">Snackzzle</a> technically fits but has some issues with arbitrary lock-key combinations, no undo, and uninteresting puzzles, so I didn‚Äôt include it.</p>

<p><a href="https://zeantwan.itch.io/getting-long">Getting Long</a> is a snake game disguised as a cute dog game. You need to eat all the crumpets without getting hit by a snail or spikes. Quite short and only a couple of real puzzles.</p>

<p>Some puzzles by Rosden Shadow where you leave a trail like a snake, but the rest of the mechanics are different from snake games:<br>
<a href="https://rosden.itch.io/statues">Statues</a><br>

<p><a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/rowlandrose/globule">Globule</a> is a puzzle game about a robot guiding a puddle of slime, which acts very much like a two-headed snake would.   However, the levels are mostly tedious.</p>

<p><a href="https://nusan.itch.io/the-serpents-shadow">The Serpent‚Äôs Shadow</a> has an interesting mechanic, which is that you need to shade an area of ground from a light source using your snake‚Äôs body.  The puzzles are not particularly deep though and there is a small real-time element.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.snake-pass.com/">Snake Pass</a> is a snake game that has puzzle elements, but is overall more of an adventure game.</p>

<p>Also omitted (due to both fundamental differences and my lack of experience) are the Pen and Paper snake puzzles.  Snakes in these logic puzzles tend to be contiguous groups of tiles whose shape has width 1 all along its length, and is bordered by empty tiles (ie the snake doesn‚Äôt touch itself).  The solver is tasked with finding the exact shape of the snake given certain information, such as numbers on rows and columns defining how many snake segments are present in that row or column.  Puzzle creators play around with what type of information to give, to keep things interesting.  I haven‚Äôt gone through enough of these puzzles to make recommendations, but here are some resources I found:</p>

<a href="https://puzzleparasite.blogspot.com/search?q=snake">Para‚Äôs Puzzle Site</a> (link is to search results for their snake puzzles).</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a type of physical puzzle called a snake cube, where you have a long string connecting small 1x1 cubes together in a snake-like shape, and you need to twist the snake into a 3x3 or 4x4 cube. I had one of these to practice on when I was younger, and would pretend that I hadn‚Äôt seen them before and then solve it in 2 seconds.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>The motivation for this article came from the astonishingly false realization that ‚ÄúI must have played nearly all snake puzzle games at this point!‚Äù My rate of discovery of new snake games came at just the right pace so that I always thought I was nearly done - a state lasting months.</p>

<p>The most difficult games to complete were Snakefall, Vertebrae, Snake Sliders, and Wriggle 3D.</p>

<p>Snakebird and Vertebrae have among the most deep and interesting mechanics, not only of all snake puzzle games, but of puzzle games generally.  The fan snakebird levels found in Snakefall are more difficult than the original levels, and demonstrate the depth of the mechanics to an even greater degree.  This is not to say the original is deficient in any way.  Snakebird makes use of two conceptually rich state-changing mechanisms: eating apples to grow, and gravity.  Each of these allows many lines of logical argument ‚Äì how long does a snake need to be in this position (defined by where it can travel with the limitations of terrain and gravity) to accomplish what I need it to accomplish?  And further, what combinations of snakes of different lengths do I need to achieve a more demanding goal?  One of the definitions of depth in puzzles is that there are conceptual sub-goals to plan out in service of solving the puzzle as a whole, and both gravity and apple eating allow for rich sub-goals.  These factors are discussed a bit by extratricky in his <a href="https://extratricky.com/blog/puzzle-patterns">blog post</a>, that includes some words about snakebird.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt want to spoil the mechanics of Vertebrae too much in my description of it above.  At first it sounds like all you do is push boxes onto buttons.  Oh and you can move backwards, how much could that affect things?  The awesome possibilities are revealed to the player soon enough, and explored with great success in the levels that follow.  There are many challenges that are conceptual rather than technical ‚Äì you might feel like you need to do some impossibly precise maneuvering to solve a puzzle, when the solution is instead based on a brilliant new idea.  There are also some impossibly precise maneuvering puzzles ;). Vertebrae has more ‚Äúoh <em>that‚Äôs</em> how!‚Äù moments than any other game on this list, and is perhaps the hardest of these very difficult four games.</p>

<p>Wriggle 3D and Snake Slider have nice puzzles that are made more challenging by asking for the optimal solution.  Many puzzle solvers find this a cheap way to increase difficulty, since it could be added to any grid-based puzzle out there, and usually will not make it more interesting, just more time consuming.  This criticism is often accurate, but in certain types of puzzles it actually becomes more interesting having to find the shortest solution.  This is true in the great board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/51/ricochet-robots">Ricochet Robots</a>, and I would argue also in these two snake games, though I still don‚Äôt think they will be for everyone.  Trying to find the shortest solution can be frustrating, since it‚Äôs often not clear what part of the solution you need to improve.  In a more traditional puzzle, the challenge of the puzzle is presented clearly to the solver; the most satisfying puzzles are often ones that immediately evoke a ‚Äúthis is surely impossible.‚Äù  But in finding an optimal solution, you are not given the problem up front, and have to <em>find</em> the problem first of all.  Is there a part of your solution that could be improved? Is there an entirely different approach that might work better?  This can be good and bad.  In the best case, it is exciting to discover an elegant tactic where you didn‚Äôt think one existed, or a completely new way to solve the puzzle.  It can also be exhilarating playing out a new solution idea, and seeing as you get closer to the finish whether you‚Äôll make it in the lowest number of moves.  In the worst case the solver must resort to brute force, checking all reasonable combinations of moves until stumbling upon the shortest sequence.  This unfortunate event is often caused by a lack of ‚Äòunderstandability‚Äô of the puzzle, so to speak.  The more intuitive or conceptual tools a solver has, the less trial and error they will need to use.  I was quite impressed with the two games mentioned here, whose puzzles keep the solver engaged and thinking conceptually, while searching for the optimal solutions.  There is something oddly satisfying about maneuvering snakes efficiently.</p>

<p>As a final note, I will aim to answer the age-old question: Can a snake move into its own tail?  The answer, as given by the applicable games above, is no! (by a count of 16 to 8)  I do suspect that part of this is due to the slight nuisance of programming it. Interestingly, in Snakebird there is a <a href="https://twitter.com/nohatcoder/status/621282209224368128">bug</a> whereby a snake cannot normally move into its tail, but it <em>can</em> move another object into its tail.  The reverse situation is present in Snake Slider, where a snake can normally move into its tail, but <em>cannot</em> push a different object into its tail.</p>
