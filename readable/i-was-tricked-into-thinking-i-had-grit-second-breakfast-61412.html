<p>I was tricked into thinking I had tons of grit as a student.</p>
<p>I worked hard in school. I put in long hours. I stayed up all night reading and preparing for debate topics, doing homework, writing essays.</p>
<p>It was easy for me to burn the midnight oil. I enjoy arguing. I enjoy reading. I enjoy math problems. I enjoy programming. I enjoy going down Wikipedia rabbit holes.</p>
<p>Somebody observing would or could have said I had<span></span> <span>“</span>grit.”</p>
<p>In <em>Range</em>, David Epstein talks about how Daniel Kahneman (yes, <em>that</em> Daniel Kahneman) and the Israeli military failed to predict who would become leaders based on who had taken control during an obstacle course challenge.</p>
<p>It’s possible to show leadership or grit or enthusiasm in one area, and then fail to show it in other activities. We all knew a hard-working athlete who slept through class, and a bookworm who never practiced shooting baskets.<a href="#footnote-1IPY" id="ref-1IPY"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In fact, I was (am?) one of those people with<span></span> <span>“</span>grit” when preparing for tests but not when working out.</p>
<p>A list of things where I’ve traditionally failed to be consistently<span></span> <span>“</span>gritty”:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Running</li>
<li>Lifting weights</li>
<li>Writing</li>
<li>Sticking to a diet</li>
<li>Developing a wake-up/go-to-bed schedule</li>
<li>Mindfulness</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Music (piano)</li>
<li>Baking</li>
<li>Cooking</li>
<li>Programming</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve improved at some of them. But<span></span> <span>“</span>grit” is too bold of a word to describe my slow, ebbing persistence.</p>
<p>This isn’t necessarily terrible. Epstein argues<span></span> <span>“</span>grit” is overrated, and even cites Angela Duckworth<a href="#footnote-2IPY" id="ref-2IPY"><sup>2</sup></a> as saying her message has been mis-understood. There’s value in re-evaluating, in not finishing the book or the project and moving on.</p>
<p>But it’s still important to try hard, to work hard, and to keep going. The reason I’ve stuck with the things I have isn’t because of grit, as I might have once believed. It’s because I enjoy doing them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>If you get someone into a context that suits them,” Ogas said,<span></span> <span>“</span>they’ll more likely work hard and it will look like grit from the outside.”</p>
