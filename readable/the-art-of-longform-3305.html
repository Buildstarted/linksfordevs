<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In December 2016, over two weeks, Sarah Perry and I taught the Ribbonfarm Longform Blogging Course to a pilot class of 10 participants. In June 2017, we expanded the course from 4 to 6 sessions, renamed it the Art of Longform, built out a Teachable course site, and taught it to a second cohort of ~30 participants.</p>
<p>The second time around, feeling foolhardy, we decided to record the videoconference sessions.</p>
<p><a href="https://ribbonfarm.teachable.com/p/the-art-of-longform"><img src="https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guru-bird-289x300.png" alt="" width="289" height="300" srcset="https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guru-bird-289x300.png 289w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guru-bird.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px"></a></p>
<p>Then I procrastinated for nearly a year, telling myself Iâ€™d learn video editing, auto-tune, and 3d graphics skills, polish the raw videos into TEDdy brilliance, add CGI dinosaurs, and release it as the first episode of the Ribbonfarm Cinematic Universe.</p>
<p>Well, that never happened, but I did manage to upload the raw videos, re-record one segment that Iâ€™d lost due to sloppy recording, add some new collateral, and FINALLY put the thing together (with an aesthetic pivot from summer blockbuster to cinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ© along the way).</p>
<p>So I give you: <a href="https://ribbonfarm.teachable.com/p/the-art-of-longform">The Art of Longform as a self-paced pre-recorded course.</a></p>
<p>Over 10 years of blogging experience, 650+ longform posts, millions of words, frequent appearances on aggregator front pages, insights from the work of many dozens of contributors, and the lessons of at least a handful of legit memeceptions and viral hits went into the pile of superstitions, magical thinking, and dubious blogging lore that constitutes the metis of ribbonfarm today.</p>
<p>That illegible pile of metis, distilled, legibilized and compacted into ~7 hours of&nbsp; authoritarian high-modernist cinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ©, is the Art of Longform.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
<p>The course is currently priced at $100. It currently contains 6h 48min of video content, 6 core slide decks, a handful of collateral documents, and plenty of resource links. I may add more material in the future, and/or update existing material if we do the live course again. The course home page linked above contains a brief intro video, and the syllabus. Some of the collateral material and the participant town hall video from the last session are open for free previewing.</p>
<p>If you enroll and work through the material, youâ€™re welcome to try and make your money back from the course, by <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/pitches-and-prompts/">pitching us a post</a>. As you might know, contributors receive a $100 honorarium for posts (our editors contribute for free, as befits their status as Gracious Elders Giving Back to the Blogosphere with Gravitas).</p>
<p>My goal with this course is like Thanosâ€™ goal in&nbsp;<em>Infinity War:&nbsp;</em>to bring balance to the universe. Well, balance to the operating cost structure of ribbonfarm at any rate. My cunning plan here rests on the assumption that Iâ€™ll be able to use course revenues to completely cover hosting costs and contributor honorariums. Weâ€™ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>Course alumni and ribbonfarm editors have discounts codes available to them, so if you know one of the editors or someone who took the live course, you may want to ping them.</p>
<p>If you really, really, want to take the course, but really, really cannot afford it, <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/pitches-and-prompts/">pitch us a post</a>, and if we like and accept your pitch, weâ€™ll comp you access to the course.</p>
<p><strong>If youâ€™ve EVER contributed a post to ribbonfarm, you can get free access. Just email me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p>
<p>I would like to thank the ~40 participants of the live course for helping make this happen, as well as editors-at-large Carlos Bueno, Taylor Pearson, Joe Kelly, Renee DiResta, and Kevin Simler for supporting the course by helping edit the participant course essays, and chiming in during the live sessions on occasion, and general background discussions. Carlos also contributed his world famous bird cartoon as course logo.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/EvanBThomas">Evan Thomas</a>, at the time a writing instructor at OSU, for his guest lecture, which added a modicum of credentialed respectability to this extremely shady operation that would totally be an unaccreditable diploma mill if we offered diplomas.</p>
<p><strong>Ribbonfarm School</strong></p>

<p>With this first serious offering, Iâ€™ve officially taken the plunge and decided to make Ribbonfarm School happen.</p>
<p>Right now, this is the only serious course on there, but more are in the pipeline, starting with the Breaking Smart 101 course based on Breaking Smart Season 1 workshop. Iâ€™m putting the finishing touches on that right now. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>And as always, Iâ€™m open to suggestions for other courses youâ€™d like to see.</p>
