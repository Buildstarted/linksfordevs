Judging by the blog post, async enumerables are the primary goal and that makes sense since that is something that will probably positively impact the end users. However, as Pinpoint points out, compatibility paths do exist.</p><blockquote><p>This is consistent with similar decisions announced last year for ASP.NET Core […]</p></blockquote><p>Not exactly though. ASP.NET Core 3 is moving to .NET Core to leverage the improvements of that <em>runtime</em>. For EF Core, we were <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/324" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/aspnet/Announcements/issues/324/hovercard">explicitly told</a> that it would remain on netstandard, implying that it would continue to run on the .NET Framework. If this changes now, then this would be a very big loss for applications that still sit in a legacy area but actively started to share code with modern applications, which is something that EF Core very nicely allows.</p><blockquote><p>Customers that need to run EF Core on .NET Framework, should plan to continue using EF Core 2.1 or 2.2.</p></blockquote><p>The problem now is that EF Core follows the support lifetime of .NET Core, so EF Core 2.2 is not an LTS release, meaning it will be quickly out of support when 3.0 lands. And EF Core 2.1 <em>is</em> an LTS release but will also eventually go out of support when 3.1 releases.</p><p>While Microsoft eventually <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3753" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/3753/hovercard">extended support for ASP.NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework</a>, it is unclear whether this also applies to EF Core 2.1. And even if it does, this means that customers will possibly have to downgrade from 2.2 which is something that somewhat works for ASP.NET Core, but can get pretty complicated with EF Core, especially if you use 2.2 features.</p><p>Ideally, I would like to see EF Core to be cross-compiled for netstandard2.1 and netstandard2.0. Utilize all the fancy stuff in 2.1 and make it super nice, but keep compatibility with netstandard2.0 for those that have to rely on that. Even if that means that some APIs won’t be available, or if the performance degrades because of that.</p><p>You always kept telling us that library authors should target the minimum-possible netstandard version to ensure high compatibility, and utilize cross-compiling to make use of modern stuff. So it would be really nice to actually see you do this yourself, especially on such a high traffic library as EF Core.</p></div></div></div></div>
