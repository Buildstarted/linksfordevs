                    <p>Apple is encouraging developers to prioritize newer web technologies inside their iOS and macOS applications.</p><p>In a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">short technical presentation</a> at the WWDC 2020 conference last week, Apple shared some internal statistics in the hope of convincing app developers to adopt new web technologies and protocols, such as IPv6, HTTP/2, TLS 1.3, and Multipatch TCP.</p><h3>IPv6</h3><p>One of the newer technologies that Apple would like developers to implement is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component="externalLink">IPv6</a>, the next iteration of the IP protocol, set to replace the older IPv4 version.</p><p>"Apple platforms have had native IPv6 support for a number of years, including support for IPv6-only networks," said Jiten Mehta, Internet Technologies Engineer at Apple.</p><p>"There has been a growing trend of IPv6 usage on the internet. If we look at the last month of connections made worldwide by Apple devices, we see that IPv6 now accounts for 26% of all connections made," Mehta added. "20% of the time, the connection could have used IPv6, but the server didn't have it enabled.</p>    


        

<p>"And when IPv6 is in use, the median connection setup is 1.4 times faster than IPv4. This is primarily due to reduced NAT usage and improved routing."</p><figure><span><img src="https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/07/01/0101fd99-0967-44e4-80a7-ab1c2117c331/ipv6-apple-stats.png" alt="ipv6-apple-stats.png"></span><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h3>HTTP/2</h3><p>Another technology that Apple is trying to get app developers to adopt is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component="externalLink">HTTP/2</a>, the current and latest version of HTTP, the protocol used to load websites on the internet.</p>


    
<p>Mehta said that in the last month, around 79% of all web pages loaded in Safari were loaded via an HTTP/2 connection, which were usually 1.8 times faster to load than the older HTTP/1.1 connections.</p><figure><span><img src="https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/07/01/653a93a6-80c0-4e8d-a15d-7f56dcbdf811/http2-apple.png" alt="http2-apple.png" data-original="https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/07/01/653a93a6-80c0-4e8d-a15d-7f56dcbdf811/http2-apple.png"></span><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple says that writing apps that work on top of IPv6 and HTTP/2 is now easier than ever. All that app developers have to do is to use the latest versions of the company's networking APIs -- such as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">URLSession</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Network.framework</a> -- which will guarantee the apps will work on IPv6 and HTTP/2 by default, with fallbacks to older protocols, when needed.</p><p>Furthermore, Apple is also looking ahead. The company will also add experimental support in macOS 11 and iOS 14 -- set to be released this fall -- for <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/http-over-quic-to-be-renamed-http3/" target="_blank">HTTP/3</a>, the next major version of the HTTP protocol, currently undergoing standardization at the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).</p><p>TLS 1.3 support is, however, disabled by default, and is only included on Apple devices for experimental purposes -- with users/app devs being required to flip a switch for it to work.</p><figure><span><img src="https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/07/01/c14b971d-61f9-47e1-b103-723582d0089c/http3-apple.png" alt="http3-apple.png" data-original="https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/07/01/c14b971d-61f9-47e1-b103-723582d0089c/http3-apple.png"></span><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h3>TLS 1.3</h3><p>In addition, Mehta also reported good news on the security front, where the newer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_1.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component="externalLink">TLS 1.3</a> security protocol has been widely deployed after the company added support for it in iOS 13.4 (November 2019).</p><p>Mehta said that over the past month, 49% of all HTTPS network connections on modern Apple devices were running TLS 1.3, where HTTPS connections were being established 1.3 times faster than connections handled via the older TLS 1.2.</p><figure><span><img src="https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/07/01/20197a69-edf5-47d8-9b0b-c5dc240d8a81/tls13-apple.png" alt="tls13-apple.png" data-original="https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/07/01/20197a69-edf5-47d8-9b0b-c5dc240d8a81/tls13-apple.png"></span><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h3>Multipath TCP</h3><p>And the final network technology that Apple hopes app developers chose to support is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_TCP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component="externalLink">Multipath TCP</a>, an extension of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that allows connections to use multiple network paths to load the same data.</p><p>Mehta said Apple uses this technology to allow apps to continue working without glitches even as users switch their internet network.</p><p>At Apple, Mehta said the company has had "great success" using this new technology for Apple Music, where the company reported a 13% reduction in stream stalls and a 22% reduction in stream stall duration, as the Apple Music service was able to function without re-starting downloads when users changed networks.</p><p><em>Last week, at the same WWDC 2020 conference, Apple also <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-adds-support-for-encrypted-dns-doh-and-dot/" target="_blank">announced full support for encrypted DNS</a> on iOS and macOS, with plans to support DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS starting macOS 11 and iOS 14.</em></p>
