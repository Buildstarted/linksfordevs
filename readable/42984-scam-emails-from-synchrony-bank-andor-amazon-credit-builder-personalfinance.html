(I have a retail CC they manage.) The agent who answered guessed why I was calling before I said anything. She asked if I was calling about an email or text message I received this morning.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">She stated the emails were not sent by Synchrony Bank, and they are still looking into what happened (see edit1). It is unclear if all of their customers received the email, or if my account info in specific was compromised. She stated they would send an email to affected customers when they knew more.</p><del>I would encourage anyone else to also call if you're unsure</del><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;"> (edited as commenters report they continue to get disconnected), but hopefully sharing these details will help calm some panic. I'm open to advice below if there are more immediate steps I should take.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Edit1:</strong> Others are reporting that some Synchrony agents are saying they sent the emails, but in error. Sounds like they haven't quite gotten their customer facing message consistent yet. In any case, do not click on any links in the emails.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Edit2:</strong> Commenters are reporting various similar responses from Amazon and Synchrony. All signs currently (as of 2:30pm ET) point to this being a technical glitch on the part of Synchrony, and not a scam or phish attempt. I will update this post again if either company puts out a statement.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Edit3:</strong> While we are waiting for a statement, I wanted to share the text of the tweet that <a href="https://twitter.com/AskSynchrony/with_replies" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">@AskSynchrony</a> is using. This is the most official thing I've seen in writing so far:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">"Thank you for reaching out. We are aware of an unplanned customer notification that is affecting some consumers &amp; are investigating the issue. We apologize for any confusion &amp; concerns this may have caused. You do not need to take any further action at this time."</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Edit4 - 4:35pm ET:</strong> Synchrony added the following banner to their <a href="https://www.synchrony.com/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">website</a>: "ALERT: We apologize for any confusion an unplanned email from Sycnhrony may have caused today. No action needs to be taken at this time." (Yes, the typo is theirs.)</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Edit5 - 11/26:</strong> Hopefully this is my last update here. Thank you to everyone who gave this post awards, I'm glad I could help! Synchrony finally sent an email announcement around 11:45pm ET. Contents copied below:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">At Synchrony we take customer satisfaction very seriously. We are writing to inform you one or more emails or text messages you may have received from Synchrony regarding “a trial deposit has been successfully made” or “action required on your application” on Monday, November 25 was sent in error.</em></p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">This was an internal error at Synchrony and did not involve a data breach or fraudulent activity.</em><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">We have confirmed none of your personal data was compromised.</strong><em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">We apologize for the error and regret any concerns this may have caused.
