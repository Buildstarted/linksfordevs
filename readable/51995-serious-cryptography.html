    <h1>Serious Cryptography</h1>
    <div class="field-item even"><p>On page 4, in the first paragraph, the sentence &quot;A cryptanalyst can then deduce that the key&#x2019;s length is either nine or a value divisible by nine (that is, three).&quot; should instead say &quot;A cryptanalyst can then deduce that the key&#x2019;s length is either nine or a value that divides nine (that is, three).&quot;</p>
<p>On page 13, the last sentence of the second paragraph under &quot;Semantic Security and Randomized Encryption: IND-CPA&quot; should say &quot;Decryption&#x200B; &#x200B;remains deterministic, however, because given &#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;<strong>D&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;</strong>&#x200B;&#x200B;(K, R, &#x200B;C), you should always&#x200B; &#x200B;get P, regardless of the value of R.&quot;</p>
<p>On page 14, in the second paragraph under &quot;Achieving Semantically Secure Encryption,&quot; all instances of &quot;<strong>DRBG</strong>(<em>K</em>, <em>R</em>)&quot; should instead be &quot;<strong>DRBG</strong>(<em>K</em> || <em>R</em>)&quot;</p>
<p>On page 28, the S_<em>k</em>+624 equation should use the constant 0x7fffffff instead of 0xffffffff.</p>
<p>On page 32, the caption for Listing 2-3 is incorrect. The script shows the evolution of /dev/random, not /dev/urandom.</p>
<p>On page 70, in the second paragraph under &quot;Ciphertext Stealing,&quot; the sentence &quot;The last, incomplete ciphertext block is made up of the first blocks from the previous ciphertext block . . .&quot; should instead say &quot;The last, incomplete ciphertext block is made up of the first bits from the previous ciphertext block . . .&quot;</p>
<p>On page 73, the second paragraph shows the equation <strong>E</strong>(<em>K</em>_1, <strong>E</strong>(<em>K</em>_2, <em>P</em>)). This equation should instead be <strong>E</strong>(<em>K</em>_2, <strong>E</strong>(<em>K</em>_1, <em>P</em>)).</p>
<p>On page 73, in the last paragraph, 2^<sup>56</sup> elements of 15 bytes each should come out to 1 exabyte, not 128 petabytes.</p>
<p>On page 84, the state values after &quot;Repeating the operation four times...,&quot; should be the following:
0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1</p><p>
And the subsequent paragraph should say &quot;And as you can see, the state after six updates is the same as the initial one, demonstrating that we&#x2019;re in a period-6 cycle and proving that the LFSR&#x2019;s period isn&#x2019;t the maximal value of 15.&quot;</p>
<p>On page 92, in the first paragraph of the RC4 section, Wireless Equivalent Privacy should be Wired Equivalent Privacy. The acronym list should also reflect this change.</p>
<p>On page 100, in the third paragraph, the sentence &quot;The brute-forcing takes 2^36 operations, a computation that dwarfs the unrealistic 2^220 * 2^31 = 2^251 trials...&quot; should instead say &quot;The brute-forcing takes 2^36 operations, a computation that is dwarfed by the unrealistic 2^220 * 2^31 = 2^251 trials...&quot;</p>
<p>On page 107, the SHA-256 hash values for a, b, and c are incorrect. They should be replaced with the following:
SHA-256(&quot;a&quot;) = ca978112ca1bbdcafac231b39a23dc4da786eff8147c4e72b9807785afee48bb
SHA-256(&quot;b&quot;) = 3e23e8160039594a33894f6564e1b1348bbd7a0088d42c4acb73eeaed59c009d</p><p>
SHA-256(&quot;c&quot;) = 2e7d2c03a9507ae265ecf5b5356885a53393a2029d241394997265a1a25aefc6</p>
<p>On page 147, in the paragraph under &quot;Encrypt-then-MAC,&quot; the sentence &quot;If the values are equal, the plaintext is computed as P = D(K1, C); if they are not equal, the plaintext is discarded.&quot; should instead say &quot;If the values are equal, the plaintext is computed as P = D(K1, C); if they are not equal, the ciphertext is discarded.&quot;</p>
<p>On page 152, the sentence beginning &quot;To authenticate the ciphertext, GCM uses a Wegman&#x2013;Carter MAC (see Chapter 7) to authenticate the ciphertext...&quot; should instead say &quot;To authenticate the ciphertext, GCM uses a Wegman&#x2013;Carter MAC (see Chapter 7)...&quot;</p>
<p>On page 154, the equation for <em>T</em>_2 should be <em>T</em>_2 = <strong>GHASH</strong>(<em>H</em>, <em>A</em>_2, <em>C</em>_2) + <strong>AES</strong>(<em>K</em>, <em>N</em> || 0).</p>
<p>On page 165, in the fourth paragraph, where it says &quot;when we say that an algorithm takes time in the order of <em>n</em>^3 operations (which is <em>quadratic complexity</em>),&quot; it should instead say &quot;when we say that an algorithm takes time in the order of <em>n</em>^3 operations (which is <em>cubic complexity</em>).&quot;</p>
<p>On page 181, the last sentence of the first paragraph should say &quot;(One year prior to RSA, Diffie and Hellman had introduced the concept of public-key cryptography, but their scheme was unable to perform public-key signatures.)&quot;</p>
<p>On page 182, in the second paragraph under &quot;The Math Behind RSA,&quot; the sentence &quot;We say that these numbers form a group, denoted <strong>Z</strong>^*_<em>n</em>, and call the multiplicative group of integer modulo <em>n</em>.&quot; should instead say &quot;We say that these numbers form a group, denoted <strong>Z</strong>^*_<em>n</em>, and call it the multiplicative group of integers modulo <em>n</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>On page 182, in the second paragraph under &quot;The Math Behind RSA,&quot; the sentence &quot;More precisely, RSA works on the numbers...&quot; should be deleted.</p>
<p>On page 183, the last sentence of the second paragraph starting with &quot;In other words...&quot; should be deleted.</p>
<p>On page 184, Listing 10-1 is incorrect. It should be replaced with the following:
sage: p = random_prime(2^32); p
1103222539
sage: q = random_prime(2^32); q
17870599
sage: n = p*q; n
19715247602230861
sage: phi = (p-1)*(q-1); phi
19715246481137724
sage: e = random_prime(phi); e
13771927877214701
sage: d = xgcd(e, phi)[1]; d
15417970063428857
sage: mod(d*e, phi)</p><p>
1</p>
<p>On page 189, in the fourth paragraph under &quot;The PSS Signature Standard,&quot; the sentence &quot;Although similar to PSS, OAEP has only been proven secure for encryption, not for signature.&quot; should instead say &quot;Although similar to PSS, OAEP has only been proven secure for encryption, not for signatures.&quot;</p>
<p>On page 189, in the second paragraph, the sentence &quot;Here&#x2019;s how this works: because <em>S </em>can be written as (<em>R^<sup>e</sup>M</em>)^<sup><em>d</em></sup> = <em>R^<sup>ed</sup>M^<sup>d</sup></em>, and because <em>R^<sup>ed</sup></em> = <em>R </em>is equal to <em>R<sup>ed</sup></em> = <em>R </em>(by definition)...&quot; should instead be &quot;Here&apos;s how this works: because <em>S</em> can be written as (<em>R^<sup>e</sup>M</em>)^<sup><em>d</em></sup> = <em>R^<sup>ed</sup>M^<sup>d</sup></em>, and because <em>R^<sup>ed</sup></em> = <em>R</em> (by definition)...&quot;</p>
<p>On page 191, in the third paragraph under &quot;RSA Implementations,&quot; the sentence &quot;The function EncryptOAEP() takes a hash value, a PRNG, a public key, a message, and a label (an optional parameter of OAEP), and returns a signature and an error code.&quot; should instead say &quot;The function EncryptOAEP() takes a hash function, a PRNG, a public key, a message, and a label (an optional parameter of OAEP), and returns a signature and an error code.&quot;</p>
<p>On page 195, in the first paragraph under &quot;The Chinese Remainder Theorem,&quot; the sentence &quot;The most common trick to speed up decryption and signature verification (that is, the computation of <em>y^d</em> mod <em>n</em>) is the <em>Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)</em>.&quot; should instead read &quot;The most common trick to speed up decryption and signature generation (that is, the computation of <em>y^d</em> mod <em>n</em>) is the <em>Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>On page 196, in the first paragraph, the sentence &quot;To apply this formula to our example and recover our <em>x</em> mod 1155, we take the arbitrary values 2, 1, 6, and 8; we compute <em>P</em>(3), <em>P</em>(5), <em>P</em>(7), and <em>P</em>(8); and then we add them together to get the following expression:&quot; should instead say &quot;To apply this formula to our example and recover our <em>x</em> mod 1155, we take the arbitrary values 2, 1, 6, and 8; we compute <em>P</em>(3), <em>P</em>(5), <em>P</em>(7), and <em>P</em>(11); and then we add them together to get the following expression:&quot;</p>
<p>On page 215, in the first paragraph, the equation g^4 = 13 should instead be g^4 = 3.</p>
<p>On page 215, the sentence &quot;The TLS protocol is the security behind HTTPS secure websites as well as the secure mail transfer protocol (SMTP).&quot; should instead read &quot;The TLS protocol is the security behind HTTPS secure websites as well as the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).&quot;</p>
<p>On page 221, the second sentence in the first paragraph under &quot;Adding Two Point&quot; should read &quot;and <em>R</em> is the reflection of this point with respect to the x-axis.&quot;</p>
<p>On page 227, the second equation on the page should be <em>wr</em> = <em>rk</em> / (<em>h</em> + <em>rd</em> ) = <em>v</em></p>
<p>On page 227, the fifth equation on the page should be <em>u</em> + <em>vd</em> = <em>hk</em> / (<em>h</em> + <em>rd</em> ) + <em>drk</em> / (<em>h</em> + <em>rd</em> ) = (<em>hk</em> + <em>drk</em> ) / (<em>h</em> + <em>rd</em> ) = <em>k</em> (<em>h</em> + <em>dr</em> ) / (<em>h</em> + <em>rd</em> ) = <em>k</em></p>
<p>On page 239, the last sentence in the first paragraph should read &quot;The organization that issued certificate 1 (GeoTrust) granted permission to Google Internet Authority to issue a certificate (certificate 0) for the domain name <em><a href="https://www.google.com">www.google.com</a></em>, thereby transferring trust to Google Internet Authority.&quot;</p>
<p>On page 243, the paragraph starting with &quot;Note, however, that TLS 1.3 supports many options and extensions . . .&quot; should be deleted. The information is repeated in the note below.</p>
<p>On page 254, the end of the first equation should be &quot;= (|0&gt; + |1&gt;) / &#x221A;2.&quot; The end of the second equation should be &quot;|&#x424;&gt; = (i/&#x221A;2, &#x2013;1/&#x221A;2).&quot;</p>
<p>On page 260, the first paragraph under &quot;Shor&apos;s Algorithm and the Discrete Logarithm Problem&quot; should read &quot;The challenge in the discrete logarithm problem is to find <em>x</em>, given <em>y</em> = <em>g^x</em> mod <em>p</em>, for some known numbers <em>g</em> and <em>p</em>. Solving this problem takes an exponential amount of time on a classical computer, but Shor&apos;s algorithm lets you find <em>x</em> easily thanks to its efficient period-finding technique.&quot;</p>
<p>On page 264, the arrow placement for figure 14-5 is slightly inaccurate. Please refer to the below figure instead:<br></p><center><img src="https://www.nostarch.com/images/corrections/seriouscrypto_p264_14-5.png"></center><br></div>
