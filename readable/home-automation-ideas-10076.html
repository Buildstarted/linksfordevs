<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"> <p>Here are a bunch of home automation ideas for your inspiration. These are examples of automation rules that have worked well for my family. They might work well for yours too.</p> <p>The ideas are technology agnostic and describe the concept rather than the exact implementation. They should work with just about any home automation system and they all adhere to the <a href="https://madskristensen.net/blog/home-automation-best-practices/">home automation best practices</a>. </p> <p>Let’s dig in.</p> <h2>Modes</h2> <p>Most home automation systems have the notion of modes. Typically, the names of these modes are <i>Home</i>, <i>Away</i> and <i>Night</i>, but there can be variations and some system let you add additional modes. You can use these modes as conditions for the home automation rules. For example, when the mode is set to <i>Night</i>, turn on lights on low dim in the kitchen when motion is detected.</p> <p>When set properly, modes are useful in many automations.</p> <p><b>Night</b></p> <ul><li>Manually set house in <i>Night</i> mode</li> <li>Automatic detection</li></ul> <p>Set the mode to <i>Night</i> when clicking a physical button or switch. A voice assistant could also trigger it when you say “goodnight”. Physical buttons are often easier to use than a voice assistant and works when offline.</p> <p>Setting <i>Night</i> mode could trigger the following events:</p> <ul><li>Turn off lights in the kitchen, living room and elsewhere </li> <li>Turn off media – music, TV etc.</li> <li>Lock the exterior doors if unlocked</li> <li>Close the garage door if open</li> <li>Arm the alarm system</li></ul> <p><b>Home</b></p> <p>There are two scenarios for when you want to trigger <i>Home</i> mode. The first is when you get out of bed in the morning and the second is when you come home to an empty house after having been away.</p> <p>In the morning, press a physical button or switch or say “good morning” to your voice assistant. The button/switch could be the same one that put the house into <em>Night</em> mode. </p> <p>After being away, unlocking the front door, opening the garage door or simply the detection of motion can put the house back in <i>Home</i> mode automatically.</p> <p>Setting <i>Home</i> mode could trigger the following events:</p> <ul><li>Turn on lights if dark inside</li> <li>Play music</li> <li>Turn on thermostat to cool or heat the house</li> <li>Turn on indoor holiday decorations</li> <li>Dock the robot vacuum</li></ul> <p><b>Away</b></p> <p>This mode should be set when everybody leaves the house, and nobody is home. Saying “goodbye” to the voice assistant is one way to set it, but it should really happen automatically instead. That way you never forget it and don’t have to worry about it.</p> <p>Automatic detection could happen this way:</p> <ul><li>House is in <i>Home</i> mode </li> <li>No motion detected in the house for 10 minutes</li> <li>All phones or presence sensors report they are not home</li> <li>No one is taking a nap in the house</li></ul> <p>Detecting someone napping during the daytime can be hard. We use white noise machines in the kids’ room for when they nap, so we use a power meter to detect when it’s on. When on, the house doesn’t go into <i>Away</i> mode. If you don’t use a white noise machine, a night/salt/lava lamp or similar will work just as well.</p> <p>If you wish to know when the mode changes between <i>Home</i> and <i>Away</i>, send a push notification to your phone if your system supports it. </p> <p>Setting <i>Away</i> mode could trigger the following events:</p> <ul><li>Lock all exterior doors if unlocked</li> <li>Close garage door if left open</li> <li>Turn off all lights, fans, and appliances in the house</li> <li>Start the robot vacuum</li> <li>Put the thermostat in “eco” mode</li> <li>Between sunset and midnight, turn on away-lights</li> <li>Arm the alarm system</li></ul> <h2>Bathroom</h2> <p>This is for bathrooms that have both a tub or shower and a toilet.</p> <p><b>Lights</b></p> <ul><li>Turn on lights when someone enters</li> <li>Turn off lights when everyone leaves</li></ul> <p><b>Fan</b></p> <ul><li>Turn on fan when door closes</li> <li>Turn off fan after 15 minutes</li></ul> <p>Use a motion sensor to turn on the lights when someone enters the bathroom. Use a door sensor to detect when the door is closed. When closed, the lights must not turn off automatically. That ensures that the lights don’t turn off while you’re in the shower or taking your time on the toilet.</p> <p>The fan turns on automatically when the door closes and turns off again after 15 minutes.</p> <p>When in <i>Night</i> mode, the lights should only come on at a low dim.</p> <p><b>Shower door</b></p> <p>This is if you have a dedicated light just for the shower.</p> <ul><li>Turn on shower lights and bathroom fan when shower door opens</li> <li>When shower lights are on, don’t turn off any other bathroom lights</li></ul> <p>If you have a glass shower door, add a door sensor too it. When the door opens, turn on the shower lights and fan. Turn off lights and fan after 15 minutes. </p> <h2>Garage</h2> <p>Whether you park your car in the garage or use it for storage or workspace, here are some automations that apply to all scenarios.</p> <p><b>Lights</b></p> <ul><li>Turn on when someone enters</li> <li>Turn off after the last person leaves </li></ul> <p>Add one or more motion sensors to cover the whole garage. When motion is detected, turn on the lights. When no motion was detected for 1 minute, turn off the lights. Depending on the location and speed of the motion sensors, consider adding a door sensor to the internal door that triggers the lights upon opening.</p> <p><b>Door</b></p> <ul><li>When going to bed, close garage door if open</li> <li>When leaving the house, close garage door if open</li></ul> <p>When the home automation system goes into <i>Night</i> or <i>Away</i> mode, check if the garage door is open and then close it.</p> <h2>Hallway closet</h2> <p>Some closets don’t have any lights or power outlets on the inside. The closest light source could be a ceiling light on the outside. Then we’ll use that in our automation.</p> <p><b>Lights</b></p> <ul><li>When in <i>Home</i> mode</li> <li>Turn lights on when door opens</li> <li>Turn lights off when door closes</li></ul> <p>Add a door sensor that triggers the light to turn on and off when the door opens and closes, respectively. If the light is located outside the closet, you may want to check if it was on before opening the door, so the automation doesn’t turn it off when the door closes.</p> <p>“Dumb” battery powered LED lights with basic motion sensing capabilities are also useful. We use them in some closets that have no other light source or power outlet. </p> <h2>Walk-in closet</h2> <p>Typically, a small room full of clothes and a ceiling light. The door is probably left open all the time.</p> <p><b>Lights</b></p> <ul><li>Turn on when someone enters</li> <li>Turn off after the last person leaves </li></ul> <p>Add a motion sensor above the door pointing slightly downwards so it covers the whole closet as well as the door entrance. When motion is detected, turn on the lights. When no motion was detected for 1 minute, turn off the lights.</p> <p>When in <i>Night</i> mode, turn on the lights at a lower dim setting to not be blinded by the bright light.</p> <h2>Kids rooms</h2> <p>Our kids can’t reach the light switch in their rooms, so automated lighting was very important for us. Otherwise they would keep asking us to come turn on the lights for them.</p> <p><b>Lights</b></p> <ul><li>When in <i>Home</i> mode</li> <li>Turn on when someone enters</li> <li>Turn off after the last person leaves </li> <li>Turn off lights when white noise machine starts (nap/bedtime begins)</li> <li>Turn on lights at low dim setting when white noise machine is off</li> <ul><li>Then slowly brighten lights over a 5-minute period</li></ul> </ul> <p><b>Blinds</b></p> <ul><li>Close blinds when white noise machine starts (nap/bedtime begins)</li> <li>Open blinds 10 minutes after white noise machine is off</li></ul> <p>Motion sensor triggers lights on/off when someone enters and leaves the room. A power meter connected to the white noise machine triggers the lights off when turned on. Turning off the white noise machine should very slowly start to brighten the ceiling lights from the lowest dim setting.</p> <p>Use an illumination (light) sensor to detect how light it is in the room before turning on the light. There is no reason to turn on lights in a room full of sunlight.</p> <h2>Master bedroom</h2> <p>This room is notorious for being hard to automate. The reason is that there are so many usage scenarios that it is hard to identify patterns automatically. We tried automating the lights, but there would be times when that would be annoying. We made modifications and kept iterating until we came up with a simple rule that works:</p> <ul><li>When in <em>Home</em> mode</li> <li>And it is dark outside (no light coming in)</li> <li>Turn on <b>master</b> <b>bathroom</b> lights when someone enters bedroom</li></ul> <p>Most of the time we enter the bedroom, it is to pass through into the master bathroom, which is also where the walk-in closet is. So, turning on the bathroom lights does light up the bedroom a bit, so we don’t have to walk in the dark. </p> <h2>Outside</h2> <p>Landscape lights are pretty, and they help you see the driveway when coming home at night.</p> <p><b>Lights</b></p> <ul><li>Turn on at sunset</li> <li>Turn off at sunrise</li> <li>Turn on additional driveway lights when car pulling in</li> <li>Turn on holiday lights at 30-60 minutes before sunset</li></ul> <p>You can buy “dumb” light switches with sunset/sunrise capability, but they are no fun and if you have multiple lights, then you can’t fully coordinate them. </p> <p>Hook up a motion sensor to trigger the driveway lights to guide the car in. Turn back off after 5 minutes of no motion detected.</p> <h2>Car</h2> <p>These days, the smart home includes the car.</p> <p><b>Door lock</b></p> <ul><li>Unlock front door when coming home</li> <li>Lock front door when leaving</li></ul> <p>Place a presence sensor somewhere in your car(s) and automatically unlock the front door when you arrive home. Unless the garage door is open/opening. If the garage door is open/opening then you are probably going to enter the house through the garage, so no need to unlock the door.</p> <h2>Miscellaneous</h2> <p>Here are some additional automations that could apply to multiple rooms or the whole house.</p> <p><b>Windows</b></p> <ul><li>When a window has been open for more than 1 minute, turn thermostat off</li> <li>When closing all windows, turn thermostat back on</li></ul> <p>Add window sensors (same as door sensor) to all windows.</p> <p><b>Night lights</b></p> <ul><li>Turn on lights when motion is detected</li></ul> <p>In the kitchen, living room and elsewhere, turn on lights at a very low dim setting when motion is detected in <i>Night</i> mode. Make sure it’s dim enough that it won’t wake up anyone sleeping in their rooms with the door open. </p> <p><b>Door lock notifications</b></p> <ul><li>Send notification when non-members of the household come and go</li></ul> <p>Get a push notification when anyone that has their own code to your smart lock uses it. That helps you keep track of how long the house cleaners spent cleaning or if your parents came to drop that thing of you asked them to while you were at work.</p> </div></div></div>
