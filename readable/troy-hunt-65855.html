<p itemprop="description">It's an extra early one this week and on review, I do look a bit... dishevelled! I run through a whole bunch of things from this week's Twitter timeline and there's some great audience questions this week too so thanks very much everyone for the engagement. Next we'll do it at the other end of the day again and I'm sure there'll be a heap of new stuff to cover before then. ReferencesThe feedback on open-sourcing HIBP has been 99.99% positive (that's about as good as you can ever hope for on the internet!)I reckon 10TB Western Digital Red drives are the sweet spot for storing data at volume these days (not everyone agrees, of course)Amazing how...

<p itemprop="description">What. A. Week. I've been absolutely non-stop publishing data breaches to HIBP whilst simultaneously putting in place the framework to start advising NordVPN on their cybers and open sourcing the HIBP code base at the same time (and a bunch of other more boring stuff that didn't make the cut). That's all explained in this week's update so I won't drill further into it here, there's obviously a couple of big announcements so if you have any questions, drop them in the comments below and I'll either answer them there or take them up in next week's update.

<p itemprop="description">Let me just cut straight to it: I'm going to open source the Have I Been Pwned code base. The decision has been a while coming and it took a failed M&amp;A process to get here, but the code will be turned over to the public for the betterment of the project and frankly, for the betterment of everyone who uses it. Let me explain why and how. HIBP is a Community ProjectI've been giving a great deal of thought to how I want this project to evolve lately, especially in the wake of the M&amp;A process that ended earlier this year right back where I'd started: with me being solely responsible for everything.

<p itemprop="description">I love security. I love privacy. Consequently, it will come as no surprise that I love tools that help people achieve those objectives. Equally, I have no patience for false promises, and I've been very vocal about my feelings there: But one of them is literally called “Secure VPN”, how is this possible?! “Are You Using These VPN Apps? Personal Info Of 20 Million Users Leaked: That’s 1.2TB Data” https://t.co/BPDww70Pgo — Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) July 20, 2020 VPNs are a great example of where a tool can be used to enhance security and privacy but often, they fall short of delivering on the promise. When you use a VPN, you're trusting a third party with...

<p itemprop="description">Unfortunately, our run of good luck here down in Aus has taken a bit of a turn COVID wise. Not so much in my home state, but the southern states have been copping it so this week, I pulled the pin on snowboarding. For folks overseas, that might sound like it would have been a risky proposition anyway, but only two and a half weeks ago the entire state of New South Wales had 5 active cases out of 8.1M people. Today it's 209. It's neighbouring southern state of Victoria had 40 cases in the middle of last month. Today they hit 5,385. It was just too risky for something that ultimately, is a luxury so I'm staying...

<p itemprop="description">I love this setup! A huge amount of research went into this but the PC, screens, cameras lights and all the other bits are working really well together. I did my first interview with this setup today and I think I'm actually going to be sticking with the mood lighting for most on-video events now: Fun @InfosecWhiskey interview this morning. I’m running with this lighting setup, just a couple of Hue Go lights and the screens, a beautiful pic from the camera setup.

<p itemprop="description">I was searching around for a quote along the lines of you only being as good as the tools you use and somehow, I ended up down this rabbit hole of painters quotes and carpenters quotes and stuff about artists and their brushes. Then I started thinking it sounds a bit obnoxious anyway so maybe it wasn't really that relevant (yet somehow, here we are...) until eventually, I thought "stuff it, let's just write about the computer bits". So here we are. More than a decade ago, I wrote about building the ultimate home office. Truth be told, that was originally written as an internal blog post at my old corporate job, largely because I wanted to demonstrate that a...

<p itemprop="description">I love beer. This comes as no surprise to regular followers, nor should it come as a surprise that I maintain an Untappd account, logging my beer experiences as I (used to 😢) travel around the world partaking in local beverages. When I received an email from someone over that way who happened to be a happy Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) user and wanted some cyber-assistance, I was intrigued. You'll never believe what happened next... The tl;dr is that someone with a BeerAdvocate account was convinced the service had been pwned as they'd seen evidence of an email address and password they'd used on the service being abused. They reached out to my guy (we'll call him that for...

<p itemprop="description">Nearly 7 years ago now, I started a little pet project to index data breaches and make them searchable. I called it "Have I Been Pwned" and I loaded in 154M breached records which to my mind, was rather sizeable. Time went by, the breaches continued and the numbers rose. A few years later in June 2016 on stage at NDC Oslo, I pushed HIBP through 1B records: Whoa, we're there, past a billion!There was much applause which I countered with "is it a joyous moment, because it's kinda sad as well?" But what's even sadder than 1B breached records is 10B breached records: New data breach now loading into @haveibeenpwned that'll push it *well* over 10,...

I've finally gotten on top of the camera setup and the Elgato HDMI dongle to allow the camera to be seen as a webcam over HDMI. I really want to write this up in detail for next week's update because with the new PC as well, I'm super happy with how this all works together. I'll try and put aside a day early next week to get on top of that one but for now, here's this week's: ReferencesChoosing what products to endorse is a thoughtful process (enough so that I wrote an...
