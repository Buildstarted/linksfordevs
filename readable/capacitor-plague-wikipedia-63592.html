<p>A 2003 article in <i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i> claimed that the cause of the faulty capacitors was in fact due to a mis-copied formula.

In the same year, the scientist's staff left China, stealing again the mis-copied formula and moving to Taiwan, where they would have created their own company, producing capacitors and propagating even more of this faulty formula of capacitor electrolytes.<sup id="cite_ref-IndArthur20030531_17-0"><a href="#cite_note-IndArthur20030531-17">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>All electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte age over time, due to evaporation of the electrolyte. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance" title="Capacitance">capacitance</a> usually decreases and the ESR usually increases. The normal lifespan of a non-solid electrolytic capacitor of consumer quality, typically rated at 2000&nbsp;h/85&nbsp;°C and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_temperature" title="Operating temperature">operating</a> at 40&nbsp;°C, is roughly 6 years. It can be more than 10 years for a 1000&nbsp;h/105&nbsp;°C capacitor operating at 40&nbsp;°C. Electrolytic capacitors that operate at a lower temperature can have a considerably longer lifespan.
</p><p>The capacitance should normally degrade to as low as 70% of the rated value, and the ESR increase to twice the rated value, over the normal life span of the component, before it should be considered as a "degradation failure".<sup id="cite_ref-Albertsen_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-Albertsen-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Parler_20-0"><a href="#cite_note-Parler-20">[20]</a></sup> The life of an electrolytic capacitor with defective electrolyte can be as little as two years. The capacitor may fail prematurely after reaching approximately 30% to 50% of its expected lifetime.

<p>The electrical characteristics of a failed electrolytic capacitor with an open vent are the following:
</p>
<ul><li>capacitance value decreases to below the rated value</li>
<li>ESR increases to very high values.</li></ul><p>Electrolytic capacitors with an open vent are in the process of drying out, regardless of whether they have good or bad electrolyte. They always show low capacitance values and very high ohmic ESR values. Dry e-caps are therefore electrically useless.
</p><p>E-caps can fail without any visible symptoms. Since the electrical characteristics of electrolytic capacitors are the reason for their use, these parameters must be tested with instruments to definitively decide if the devices have failed. But even if the electrical parameters are out of their specifications, the assignment of failure to the electrolyte problem is not a certainty.
</p><p>Non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors without visible symptoms, which have improperly formulated electrolyte, typically show two electrical symptoms:

<p>Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are generally called "electrolytic capacitors" or "e-caps". The components consist of two strips of aluminum foil, separated by a paper spacer, which is saturated with a liquid or gel-like electrolyte. One of the aluminum foil strips, called the anode, chemically roughened and oxidized in a process called <i>forming</i>, holds a very thin oxide layer on its surface as an electrical insulator serving as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric" title="Dielectric">dielectric</a> of the capacitor. The liquid electrolyte, which is the cathode of the capacitor, covers the irregular surface of the oxide layer of the anode perfectly, and makes the increased anode surface effectual, thus increasing the effective capacitance.
</p><p>A second aluminum foil strip, called the "cathode foil", serves to make electrical contact with the electrolyte.  The spacer separates the foil strips to avoid direct metallic contact which would produce a short circuit. Lead wires are attached to both foils which are then rolled with the spacer into a wound cylinder which will fit inside an aluminum case or "can". The winding is impregnated with liquid electrolyte. This provides a reservoir of electrolyte to extend the lifetime of the capacitor. The assembly is inserted into an aluminum can and sealed with a plug. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte have grooves in the top of the case, forming a vent, which is designed to split open in the event of excessive gas pressure caused by heat, short circuit, or failing electrolyte.

<p>The aluminum foil used in non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors must have a purity of 99.99%. The foil is roughened by electrochemical etching to enlarge the effective capacitive surface.  This etched anode aluminum foil is oxidized (called <i>forming</i>). Forming creates a very thin oxide barrier layer on the anode surface.  This oxide layer is electrically insulating and serves as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric" title="Dielectric">dielectric</a> of the capacitor. The forming takes place whenever a positive voltage is applied to the anode, and generates an oxide layer whose thickness varies according to the applied voltage.  This electrochemical behavior explains the self-healing mechanism of non-solid electrolytic capacitors.
</p><p>The normal process of oxide formation or self-healing is carried out in two reaction steps.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> First, a strongly exothermic reaction transforms metallic aluminum (Al) into <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum_hydroxide" title="Aluminum hydroxide">aluminum hydroxide</a>, Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>:
</p>
<dl><dd>2 Al + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O → 2 Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub> ↑</dd></dl><p>This reaction is accelerated by a high electric field and by high temperatures, and is accompanied by a pressure buildup in the capacitor housing, caused by the released hydrogen gas. The gel-like aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> (also called alumina trihydrate (ATH), aluminic hydroxide, aluminum(III) hydroxide, or hydrated alumina) is converted, via a second reaction step (usually slowly over a few hours at room temperature, more rapidly in a few minutes at higher temperatures), into the amorphous or crystalline form of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum_oxide" title="Aluminum oxide">aluminum oxide</a>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:
</p>
<dl><dd>2 Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> → 2 AlO(OH) + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O → Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O</dd></dl><p>This oxide serves as dielectric and also protects the capacitor from the aggressive reactions of metallic aluminum to parts of the electrolyte. One problem of the forming or self-healing processes in non-solid aluminum electrolytics is that of corrosion, the electrolyte having to deliver enough oxygen to generate the oxide layer, with water, corrosive of aluminum, being the most efficient way.

<p>The name "electrolytic capacitor" derives from the electrolyte, the conductive liquid inside the capacitor. As a liquid it can conform to the etched and porous structure of the anode and the grown oxide layer, and form a "tailor-made" cathode.
</p><p>From an electrical point of view the electrolyte in an electrolytic capacitor is the actual <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode" title="Cathode">cathode</a> of the capacitor and must have good electrical conductivity, which is actually <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion" title="Ion">ion</a>-conductivity in liquids. But it is also a chemical mixture of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvents</a> with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid" title="Acid">acid</a> or <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali" title="Alkali">alkali</a> additives,<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> which must be <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion" title="Corrosion">non-corrosive</a> (chemically <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemically_inert" title="Chemically inert">inert</a>) so that the capacitor, whose inner components are made of aluminum, remains stable over its expected lifetime. In addition to the good conductivity of operating electrolytes, there are other requirements, including chemical stability, chemical compatibility with aluminum, and low cost. The electrolyte should also provide oxygen for the forming processes and self-healing. This diversity of requirements for the liquid electrolyte results in a broad variety of proprietary solutions, with thousands of patented electrolytes.
</p><p>Up to the mid 1990s electrolytes could be roughly placed into two main groups:
</p>
<ul><li>electrolytes based on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol" title="Ethylene glycol">ethylene glycol</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boric_acid" title="Boric acid">boric acid</a>. In these so-called glycol or <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borax" title="Borax">borax</a> electrolytes, an unwanted chemical crystal water reaction occurs: "acid + alcohol gives ester + water". These borax electrolytes have been standard in electrolytic capacitors for a long time, and have a water content between 5 and 20%. They work up to a maximum temperature of 85&nbsp;°C or 105&nbsp;°C in the voltage range up to 600&nbsp;V.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup></li>
<li>almost anhydrous electrolytes based on organic solvents, such as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethylformamide" title="Dimethylformamide">dimethylformamide</a> (DMF), <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethylacetamide" title="Dimethylacetamide">dimethylacetamide</a> (DMA), or <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%93-butyrolactone" title="Γ-butyrolactone">γ-butyrolactone</a> (GBL). These capacitors with organic-solvent electrolytes are suitable for temperatures ranging up to 105&nbsp;°C, 125&nbsp;°C, or 150&nbsp;°C; have low leakage current values; and have very good long-term behavior.</li></ul><p>It was known that water is a very good solvent for low ohmic electrolytes. However, the corrosion problems linked to water hindered, up to that time, the use of it in amounts larger  than 20% of the electrolyte, the water-driven corrosion using the above-mentioned electrolytes being kept under control with chemical inhibitors that stabilize the oxide layer.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Alfonso_31-0"><a href="#cite_note-Alfonso-31">[31]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the 1990s a third class of electrolytes was developed by Japanese researchers.

<ul><li>Water-based electrolytes, with up to 70% water, are relatively inexpensive and boast desirable characteristics such as low ESR and higher voltage handling.

<li>Despite these advantages, researchers faced several challenges during development of water-based electrolytic capacitors.</li>

The capacitor plague is due to faulty electrolytes of this type.</li></ul><h3><span id="Development_of_a_water-based_electrolyte">Development of a water-based electrolyte</span><span><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Capacitor_plague&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17" title="Edit section: Development of a water-based electrolyte" data-section="17">Edit</a></span></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the 1990s, some Japanese manufacturers started the development of a new, low-ohmic water-based class of electrolytes. Water, with its high <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permittivity" title="Permittivity">permittivity</a> of ε&nbsp;=&nbsp;81, is a powerful solvent for electrolytes, and possesses high solubility for conductivity-enhancing concentrations of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)" title="Salt (chemistry)">salt</a> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ions" title="Ions">ions</a>, resulting in significantly improved conductivity compared to electrolytes with organic <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvents</a> like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Butyrolactone" title="Gamma-Butyrolactone">GBL</a>. But water will react quite aggressively and even violently with unprotected aluminum, converting metallic aluminum (Al) into <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum_hydroxide" title="Aluminum hydroxide">aluminum hydroxide</a> (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>), via a highly <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic" title="Exothermic">exothermic</a> reaction that gives off heat, causing gas expansion that can lead to an explosion of the capacitor. Therefore, the main problem in the development of water-based electrolytes is achieving long-term stability by hindering the corrosive action of water on aluminum.
</p><p>Normally the anode foil is covered by the dielectric <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum_oxide" title="Aluminum oxide">aluminum oxide</a> (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) layer, which protects the base aluminum metal against the aggressiveness of aqueous alkali solutions. However, some impurities or weak points in the oxide layer offer the possibility for water-driven anodic corrosion that forms aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>). In e-caps using an alkaline electrolyte this aluminum hydroxide will not be transformed into the desired stable form of aluminum oxide. The weak point remains and the anodic corrosion is ongoing. This corrosive process can be interrupted by protective substances in the electrolyte known as inhibitors or passivators.<sup id="cite_ref-Alfonso_31-1"><a href="#cite_note-Alfonso-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Inhibitors—such as chromates, phosphates, silicates, nitrates, fluorides, benzoates, soluble oils, and certain other chemicals—can reduce the anodic and cathodic corrosion reactions. However, if inhibitors are used in an insufficient amount, they tend to increase pitting.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup></p>

<p>The aluminum oxide layer in the electrolytic capacitor is resistant to chemical attacks, as long as the pH value of the electrolyte is in the range of pH 4.5 to 8.5.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> However, the pH value of the electrolyte is ideally about 7 (neutral); and measurements carried out as early as the 1970s have shown that leakage current is increased, due to chemically induced defects, when the pH value deviates from this ideal value.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> It is known that water is extremely corrosive to pure aluminum and introduces chemical defects. It is further known that unprotected aluminum oxide dielectrics can be slightly dissolved by alkaline electrolytes, weakening the oxide layer.<sup id="cite_ref-HHpaper_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-HHpaper-36">[36]</a></sup></p><p>The fundamental issue of water-containing-electrolyte systems lies in the control of aggressiveness of the water towards metallic aluminum. This issue has dominated the development of electrolytic capacitors over many decades.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>  The first commercially used electrolytes in the mid-twentieth century were mixtures of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol" title="Ethylene glycol">ethylene glycol</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boric_acid" title="Boric acid">boric acid</a>. But even these glycol electrolytes had an unwanted chemical water-crystal reaction, according to the scheme: "acid + <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>" → "<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester" title="Ester">ester</a> + water". Thus, even in the first apparently water-free electrolytes, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esterification" title="Esterification">esterification</a> reactions could generate a water content of up to 20 percent. These electrolytes had a voltage-dependent life span, because at higher voltages the leakage current based on the aggressiveness of the water would increase exponentially; and the associated increased consumption of electrolyte would lead to a faster drying out.<sup id="cite_ref-Albertsen_19-1"><a href="#cite_note-Albertsen-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Parler_20-1"><a href="#cite_note-Parler-20">[20]</a></sup> Otherwise, the electrolyte has to deliver the oxygen for self-healing processes, and water is the best chemical substance to do that.<sup id="cite_ref-Uzawa_18-2"><a href="#cite_note-Uzawa-18">[18]</a></sup></p>

<span><center><b>Attempt at a pictorial representation of the formation of aluminum hydroxide<br>in a pore of a roughened electrolytic capacitor anode foil</b></center></span>

<p>It is known that the "normal" course of building a stable aluminum oxide layer by the transformation of aluminum, through the intermediate step of aluminum hydroxide, can be interrupted by an excessively alkaline or basic electrolyte. For example, alkaline disruption of the chemistry of this reaction results instead in the following reaction:
</p>
<dl><dd>2 Al (s) + 2 NaOH (aq) + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O → 2 Na<sup>+</sup> (aq) + 2[Al(OH)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>−</sup> (s) + 3 H<sub>2</sub> (g)</dd></dl><p>In this case, it may happen that the hydroxide formed in the first step becomes mechanically detached from the metallic aluminum surface and will not be transformed into the desired stable form of aluminum oxide.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears. (November 2015)">page&nbsp;needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The initial self-healing process for building a new oxide layer is prevented by a defect or a weak dielectric point, and generated hydrogen gas escapes into the capacitor. Then, at the weak point, further formation of aluminum hydroxide is started, and prevented from converting into stable aluminum oxide. The self-healing of the oxide layer inside the electrolytic capacitor can not take place. However, reactions do not come to a standstill, as more and more hydroxide grows in the pores of the anode foil, and the first reaction step produces more and more hydrogen gas in the can, increasing the pressure.

<p>The Japanese manufacturer <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubycon_Corporation" title="Rubycon Corporation">Rubycon</a> became a leader in the development of new water-based electrolyte systems with enhanced conductivity in the late 1990s.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2015)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> After several years of development, researchers led by Shigeru Uzawa had found a mixture of inhibitors that suppressed the aluminum hydration. In 1998, Rubycon announced two series, ZL and ZA, of the first production capacitors using an electrolyte with a water content of about 40%, which were suitable for temperatures ranging from −40&nbsp;°C (−40&nbsp;°F; 233&nbsp;K) to 105&nbsp;°C (221&nbsp;°F; 378&nbsp;K). Later, electrolytes were developed to work with water of up to 70% by weight.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2015)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Other manufacturers, such as NCC,<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> Nichicon,<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> and Elna<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> followed with their own products a short time later.
</p><p>The improved conductivity of the new electrolyte can be seen by comparing two capacitors, both of which have a nominal capacitance of 1000&nbsp;μF at 16&nbsp;V rated voltage, in a package with a diameter of 10&nbsp;mm and a height of 20&nbsp;mm. The capacitors of the Rubycon YXG series are provided with an electrolyte based on an organic solvent and can attain an impedance of 46&nbsp;mΩ when loaded with a ripple current of 1400&nbsp;mA. ZL series capacitors with the new water-based electrolyte can attain an impedance of 23&nbsp;mΩ with a ripple current of 1820&nbsp;mA, an overall improvement of 30%.
</p><p>The new type of capacitor was called "Low-ESR" or "Low-Impedance", "Ultra-Low-Impedance" or "High-Ripple Current" series in the data sheets. The highly competitive market in digital data technology and high-efficiency power supplies rapidly adopted these new components because of their improved performance. Furthermore, by improving the conductivity of the electrolyte, capacitors not only can withstand a higher ripple current rating, they are much cheaper to produce since water is much cheaper than other solvents. Better performance and low cost drove widespread adoption of the new capacitors for high volume products such as PCs, LCD screens, and power supplies.

<p>Industrial espionage was implicated in the capacitor plague, in connection with the theft of an electrolyte formula.

<h3><span id="Incomplete_electrolyte_formula">Incomplete electrolyte formula</span><span><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Capacitor_plague&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23" title="Edit section: Incomplete electrolyte formula" data-section="23">Edit</a></span></h3>
<p>Unimpeded formation of hydroxide (hydration) and associated hydrogen gas production, occurring during "capacitor plague" or "bad capacitors" incidents involving the failure of large numbers of aluminum electrolytic capacitors, has been demonstrated by two researchers at the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Advanced_Life_Cycle_Engineering" title="Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering">Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering</a> of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland" title="University of Maryland">University of Maryland</a> who analyzed the failed capacitors.<sup id="cite_ref-HHpaper_36-2"><a href="#cite_note-HHpaper-36">[36]</a></sup></p><p>The two scientists initially determined, by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_chromatography" title="Ion chromatography">ion chromatography</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry" title="Mass spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a>, that there was hydrogen gas present in failed capacitors, leading to bulging of the capacitor's case or bursting of the vent. Thus it was proved that the oxidation takes place in accordance with the first step of aluminum oxide formation.
</p><p>Because it has been customary in electrolytic capacitors to bind the excess hydrogen by  using reducing or <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depolarizer" title="Depolarizer">depolarizing</a> compounds, such as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic" title="Aromatic">aromatic</a> nitrogen compounds or <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amines" title="Amines">amines</a>, to relieve the resulting pressure, the researchers then searched for compounds of this type. Although the analysis methods were very sensitive in detecting such pressure-relieving compounds, no traces of such agents were found within the failed capacitors.
</p><p>In capacitors in which the internal pressure build-up was so great that the capacitor case was already bulging but the vent had not opened yet, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a> value of the electrolyte could be measured. The electrolyte of the faulty Taiwanese capacitors was alkaline, with a pH of between 7 and 8. Good comparable Japanese capacitors had an electrolyte that was acidic, with a pH of around 4. As it is known that aluminum can be dissolved by alkaline liquids, but not that which is mildly acidic, an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy" title="Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy">energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy</a> (EDX or EDS) fingerprint analysis of the electrolyte of the faulty capacitors was made, which detected dissolved aluminum in the electrolyte.
</p><p>To protect the metallic aluminum against the aggressiveness of the water, some phosphate compounds, known as inhibitors or <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivation_(chemistry)" title="Passivation (chemistry)">passivators</a>, can be used to produce long-term stable capacitors with high-aqueous electrolytes. Phosphate compounds are mentioned in patents regarding electrolytic capacitors with aqueous electrolytic systems.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> Since phosphate ions were missing and the electrolyte was also alkaline in the investigated Taiwanese electrolytes, the capacitor evidently lacked any protection against water damage, and the formation of more-stable alumina oxides was inhibited. Therefore, only aluminum hydroxide was generated.
</p><p>The results of chemical analysis were confirmed by measuring electrical capacitance and leakage current in a long-term test lasting 56&nbsp;days. Due to the chemical corrosion, the oxide layer of these capacitors had been weakened, so after a short time the capacitance and the leakage current increased briefly, before dropping abruptly when gas pressure opened the vent. The report of Hillman and Helmold proved that the cause of the failed capacitors was a faulty electrolyte mixture used by the Taiwanese manufacturers, which lacked the necessary chemical ingredients to ensure the correct pH of the electrolyte over time, for long-term stability of the electrolytic capacitors. Their further conclusion, that the electrolyte with its alkaline pH value had the fatal flaw of a continual buildup of hydroxide without its being converted into the stable oxide, was verified on the surface of the anode foil both photographically and with an EDX-fingerprint analysis of the chemical components.
