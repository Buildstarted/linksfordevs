<p>UnrealCLR is a plugin which natively integrates .NET Core host into the Unreal Engine with the Common Language Runtime for direct execution of managed code to build a game logic using the full power of C# and .NET facilities with engine API. The project is aimed at stability, performance, and maintainability.</p>

<h2>Building</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unreal Engine 4.25.3 or higher</li>
<li>A native <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Development/VisualStudioSetup/index.html#runtheunrealenginepre-requisiteinstaller" rel="nofollow">compilation toolchain</a> with platform-specific dependencies</li>
<li><a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1" rel="nofollow">.NET Core SDK 3.1.302</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Auto</h3>
<h4>Compilation</h4>
<p>Create a new or use an existing Unreal Engine C++ or blueprints project. Clone the repository or download a desirable version from the <a href="https://github.com/nxrighthere/UnrealCLR/releases">releases</a> section. Navigate to <code>Install</code> folder, and run <code>dotnet run</code> command. Follow the installation instructions. Open the project after the installation process is complete.</p>
<h4>Upgrading</h4>
<p>To upgrade the plugin, re-run the installation process. Recompile custom code with an updated framework.</p>
<h3>Manual</h3>
<h4>Compilation</h4>
<h5>Plugin</h5>
<p>Create a new or use an existing Unreal Engine C++ or blueprints project. Clone the repository or download a desirable version from the <a href="https://github.com/nxrighthere/UnrealCLR/releases">releases</a> section. Copy the content of the <code>Source/Native</code> folder to <code>%Project%/Plugins/UnrealCLR</code> directory. Compile the managed runtime from <code>Source/Managed/Runtime</code> folder by running the following command: <code>dotnet publish --configuration Release --framework netcoreapp3.1 --output "%Project%/Plugins/UnrealCLR/Managed"</code>. Restart Unreal Engine, open the project, and build the plugin.</p>
<h5>Tests</h5>
<p>To quickly start testing, open a project with the plugin in Unreal Engine, copy all folders from the <code>Content</code> of the repository to <code>%Project%/Content</code> directory, and wait until they loaded in the Content Browser. Compile the managed assemblies from <code>Source/Managed/Tests</code> folder by running the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>dotnet publish "../Framework" --configuration Release --framework netcoreapp3.1
dotnet publish --configuration Release --framework netcoreapp3.1 --output "%Project%/Managed/Tests"
</code></pre>
<h4>Upgrading</h4>
<p>To upgrade, delete the plugin folder from a project, and repeat all steps from the compilation section. Recompile custom code with an updated framework.</p>
<h2>Running</h2>
<h3>Plugin</h3>
<p>The plugin is automatically loaded at startup. To make sure that it's initialized open the console window from <code>Window -&gt; Developer Tools -&gt; Output Log</code>, find <code>UnrealCLR</code> logs using the search input.</p>
<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>Open the scene with tests in the editor and enter the play mode. To switch a test, navigate to <code>Blueprints -&gt; Open Level Blueprint</code>, select the <code>Test Systems</code> enumeration, and change default value on the right panel.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Design and architecture</h3>
<p>UnrealCLR is designed to be flexible and extensible. The plugin is transparently managing core functionality of the runtime, binding and caching the engine API for managed environment. The programmer has full control over execution flow through blueprint pipelines that allow to dynamically weave native events of the engine and its objects with managed logic. There's no hidden states or obscured order of execution behind the lifecycle of scripts.</p>
<h3>Assemblies management</h3>
<p>At runtime, UnrealCLR loading managed assemblies into a cached isolated context. It allows dynamically replace assemblies after unloading them from memory, therefore the programmer can work with code without restarting the editor for continuous development. The compilation pipeline is entirely up to a developer, it can be organized in any desirable way without any limitations and with full support of <a href="https://www.nuget.org/" rel="nofollow">NuGet</a> packages.</p>
<h3>Engine application program interface</h3>
<p>The plugin and framework are evolving all the time to utilize as much power of the Unreal Engine as possible. It's crucial to have a feature-rich API. The system is created with high-performance in mind but without trading safety. The vast majority of code is written and verified by hand to prevent any unexpected behaviors at runtime and to ensure stability.</p>
<h3>Powerful tooling</h3>
<p>Use your favorite IDE and <a href="https://github.com/natemcmaster/dotnet-tools">.NET tools</a> that can be attached to the process of the engine just as to a regular .NET application for profiling and debugging. It's very convenient and works out of the box without any external effort. Analyze performance, monitor CPU usage and memory consumption, debug execution, take full control over the code. Explore new possibilities and extend your toolset in no time.</p>
<h2>Essentials</h2>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The runtime redirects all unhandled exceptions to log files and on-screen messages of the engine, however, it's highly recommended to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/exceptions/how-to-use-the-try-catch-block-to-catch-exceptions" rel="nofollow">try/catch</a> blocks to override redirections with custom handlers. It's necessary to have an attached debugger to properly trace exceptions in the editor or standalone.</p>
<h3>Memory management</h3>
<p>Unreal Engine, as well as .NET runtime, utilizes a garbage collector for memory management. The framework is designed with consistency in mind to prevent crashes and validate memory transparently for a programmer, no matter how objects were created and freed: with C++, C#, or blueprints.</p>
<h3>Hot reload</h3>
<p>The plugin is independent of the compilation routine of user assemblies. It's loading assemblies from <code>%Project%/Managed</code> folder and resolving dependencies at runtime after entering/leaving the play mode. The framework of the plugin with the engine API is automatically recognized and loaded as a dependency.</p>
<h3>Ecosystem compatibility</h3>
<p>The framework replicates the classes hierarchy of the engine with full interoperability support. Any external C++ code, blueprints, and plugins are compatible and extensible with UnrealCLR by design through the engine API.</p>
