    <h1>Fed-up graphic design outfit dangles cash to anyone who can free infosec of hoodie pics</h1>
    <div id="body"> <p>Uninspired by the stock imagery used by the media to depict cybersecurity, a graphic design group is offering cash prizes to anyone who comes up with something more original than dodgy hoodie-wearing laptop users with waterfalls of cascading 1s and 0s behind them.</p> <p>Challenging the very foundations upon which <i>El Reg</i>&apos;s image library has been painstakingly honed by the finest and most sober minds* ever seen in the field of technology journalism, Open Ideo wants to pump cash at anyone who can shift the age-old stereotype of the hoodie hacker.</p> <p>In a contest titled &quot;How might we reimagine a more compelling and relatable visual language for cybersecurity?&quot;, the foundation urges &quot;creators from diverse backgrounds&quot; to apply their skill set to &quot;this important work&quot;.</p> <div class="CaptionedImage Border width_85"><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/11/02/hacker.jpg"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/11/02/hacker.jpg?x=442&amp;y=335&amp;infer_y=1" alt="hacker" width="442"></a>
<p class="text_center">&quot;Visuals in the cybersecurity space reflect surface level understanding influenced by sensationalist media&quot;</p>
</div> <p>Bemoaning the state of stock imagery everywhere, Open Ideo said: &quot;We see pictures of locks, white men in hoodies, or green 1s and 0s that do little to convey the reality of this complicated, critically important topic.&quot;</p> <p>We here at <i>The Register</i> can&apos;t see what the fuss is about. Who hasn&apos;t been to Black Hat and seen cascading waterfalls of 1s and 0s everywhere?</p> <div class="CaptionedImage Border width_85"><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/08/31/hacker_shutterstock.jpg"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/08/31/hacker_shutterstock.jpg?x=442&amp;y=295&amp;infer_y=1" alt="hacker" width="442"></a>
<p class="text_center">Awful, isn&apos;t it?</p>
</div> <p>To stimulate the minds of graphics people, Open Ideo has <a href="https://www.openideo.com/challenge-briefs/cybersecurity-visuals">published a brief</a> about the target audiences for their challenge. They include a description of a &quot;high-profile journalist&quot;:</p> <p>We don&apos;t know why low-profile journalists (cough cough) don&apos;t get a look-in. Perhaps Open Ideo are resigned to the idea that the great unwashed outside America will continue gratuitously publishing imagery of hoodie hackers because nobody&apos;s giving us anything better to work with &#x2013; at least, not without charging megabucks in the process.</p> <p>A similar pen picture for a low-profile journalist needing non-hoodie imagery might say the following:</p> <p>&quot;Up to 25 shortlisted contributors will receive mentorship from a cybersecurity expert and $500 each,&quot; we are told by Open Ideo, while five more lucky non-hoodie-artists will have $7,000 bestowed upon each of them.</p> <p>If you are a Russian or from Eastern Europe, however, bad news: you&apos;re not eligible for the prize. Only folk from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom, and the good ol&apos; US of A can claim their spondulicks.</p> <p>Mickey-taking aside, the lack of useful imagery about what &quot;cybersecurity&quot; involves is a genuine problem for the industry as a whole.</p> <p>Joe Public doesn&apos;t know or care about the differences between a white hat and a black hat (grey hats are right out) and telly news stations, bound to compress the world&apos;s complexities into 2m 30s of footage that even your granny could understand, grab the first easy image they can think of and run with that.</p> <div class="CaptionedImage Border width_85"><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/11/16/hacker_shutterstock.jpg"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/11/16/hacker_shutterstock.jpg?x=442&amp;y=295&amp;infer_y=1" alt="Hacker" width="442"></a>
<p class="text_center">Seriously. Everyone outside it thinks infosec is some bastard offspring of <i>The Matrix</i> and that dodgy underpass near your house where the bad kids hang out</p>
</div> <p>By shifting that image of what a cybersecurity professional looks like, the wider industry stands to gain a lot and lose very little. Who doesn&apos;t want to be taken seriously by the wider world, all those know-nothing civilians whose very digital-dependent way of life depends on the uptime underwritten by &quot;those weirdos in hoodies down in the basement&quot;?</p> <p>As the allegedly porcine-fancying former UK Prime Minister David Cameron didn&apos;t quite say, it&apos;s time to stop hugging hoodies.</p> <p>Get cracking. Your industry really does need you. &#xAE;</p> <p>*Part of this statement may or may not be untrue</p> <p class="wptl btm"> <span>Sponsored: </span> <a href="https://go.theregister.co.uk/tl/1842/-7432/balancing-consumerization-and-corporate-control?td=wptl1842">Balancing consumerization and corporate control</a> </p> </div>
