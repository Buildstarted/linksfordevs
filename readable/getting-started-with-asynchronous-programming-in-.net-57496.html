<h6>Description</h6>
<p>Utilizing asynchronous principles is crucial for building fast and responsive applications. In this course, Getting Started with Asynchronous Programming in .NET, youâ€™ll learn foundational knowledge to efficiently apply the asynchronous principles to build fast and solid applications. First, youâ€™ll explore how the async and await keywords fit into your .NET applications, and how it ties together with the task parallel library. Next, youâ€™ll discover how asynchronous programming is different from parallel programming and how to use the parallel extensions to perform fast computations, which utilizes all your available processing power. Finally, youâ€™ll learn how to adapt in advanced scenarios, and where deeper knowledge of the internals may be required. When youâ€™re finished with this course, youâ€™ll have the skills and knowledge of how to apply the asynchronous programming principles in any type of .NET application.</p>

<h6>Section Introduction Transcripts</h6>
<p><span>Course Overview</span><br>Hi everyone, my name is Filip Ekberg, and welcome to the course Getting Started with Asynchronous Programming in .NET. I'm a principle consultant and CEO at a consultant agency operating out of Gothenburg in Sweden. I started this company a few years ago and focused on building fast, powerful, and easy-to-maintain solutions. This course is for those of you that want to build fast, responsive, and overall better applications by applying the asynchronous principles. We'll cover all the topics that you need to understand to safely and effectively introduce asynchronous programming in your applications. This includes introducing the async and await keywords and getting a complete understanding of how that affects the application and the potential problems that you may run into, also understanding how to use the Task Parallel Library to introduce your own asynchronous operations and how that fits into the bigger picture. You'll also be familiar with the differences between the asynchronous and parallel programming and how to perform parallel computation using the Parallel Extensions. Finally, you'll get an insight into the advanced topics, as well as the internals of async and await, which ultimately makes you appreciate all the effort the compiler is doing for us. By the end of this course, you'll know how to effectively apply asynchronous and parallel principles by using the async and await keywords, the Task Parallel Library, and Parallel Extensions. This gives you a good understanding of how that affects the application, the common issues you may run into, and how to adapt to more complex scenarios. Before beginning this course, you should be familiar with programming in C#. No prior knowledge of threading, asynchronous, or parallel programming is required. I hope you join me in this journey to learn how to build fast, responsive, and powerful applications by applying the asynchronous principles with the course Getting Started with Asynchronous Programming in .NET, at Pluralsight.</p>
