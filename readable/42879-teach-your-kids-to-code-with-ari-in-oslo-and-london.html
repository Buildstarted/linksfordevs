    <h1>Teach Your Kids to Code with Ari in Oslo and London</h1>
    <div><section class="article_text post"> <p>When I first started writing code a few decades ago, it was a rather bland affair involving a basic text editor and physical books for reference. I didn&apos;t have an opportunity to create anything usable by others until years later and perhaps most importantly in the context of this blog post, I didn&apos;t have anyone in my family able to <em>teach</em> me about coding. For many kids today, that last point is still just as relevant as it was in the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s with one major caveat - it doesn&apos;t have to be. Teaching your kids to code is easier today than ever before with zero experience required.</p><p>Since my kids have been around 6 years old, I&apos;ve been teaching them both to code via freely available online resources, namely <a href="https://code.org/">code.org</a> and <a href="https://codecombat.com/">Code Combat</a>. I cannot recommend either of these highly enough; they&apos;re both visually engaging, super easy to get started with and they load directly in your browser with no software installation required. When it comes to my kids, my very conference-centric professional life has given me the opportunity to get them involved not just in writing code at home, but becoming a part of the industry by attending events with me. In January this year, that meant getting my eldest (Ari) up on stage at NDC London and sharing what he&apos;d learned with a room full of developers (this video is a good intro to the above-mentioned resources if they&apos;re new to you):</p><iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1ldaxeznRE" class></iframe><p>For 2020, I wanted to level that up and get Ari more involved in the NDC events I&apos;ll be doing in Oslo and London this coming Jan. I didn&apos;t just want him talking to adults, I wanted him talking to his own peers as well - other kids. So we decided to run a DevClub for kids at both events and make them totally free. Just bring a kid and a laptop and you&apos;re good to go! Ari will be supported by other NDC speakers (including myself) and the wonderful folks from Code Combat are sending us over a pile of stickers to hand out as well. This will be an opportunity for parents who may not have given a lot of thought to the topic before to get their kids started on a path that may one day become both a career and a passion.</p><p><a href="https://ndc-security.com/">NDC Security in Oslo</a> runs from Jan 22-24 and we&apos;ll be running the DevClub at 17:00 on Wednesday 22 Jan:</p><p><a href="https://ndc-security.com/page/devclub/"><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/11/devclu-security.png" class="kg-image"></a></p><p><a href="https://ndc-london.com/">NDC London</a> runs from Jan 27-31 and the DevClub will be at 17:00 again albeit on Thursday 30 Jan:</p><p><a href="https://ndc-london.com/page/devclub/"><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/11/Devclub-London33.png" class="kg-image"></a></p> <section class="article-open_tag"> <a class="tag" href="/tag/kids/">Kids</a> </section> </section><footer class="post"> <section class="article-open_shere"> <a class="article-open_shere-twitter article-open_window" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Troy%20Hunt%3A%20Teach%20Your%20Kids%20to%20Code%20with%20Ari%20in%20Oslo%20and%20London&amp;url=https://www.troyhunt.com/teach-your-kids-to-code-with-ari-in-oslo-and-london/"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i> Tweet</a> <a class="article-open_shere-facebook article-open_window" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.troyhunt.com/teach-your-kids-to-code-with-ari-in-oslo-and-london/"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i> Post</a> <a class="article-open_shere-linkedin article-open_window" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://www.troyhunt.com/teach-your-kids-to-code-with-ari-in-oslo-and-london/"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i> Update</a> <a class="article-open_shere-email" href="mailto:?subject=Troy%20Hunt%3A%20Teach%20Your%20Kids%20to%20Code%20with%20Ari%20in%20Oslo%20and%20London&amp;body=https://www.troyhunt.com/teach-your-kids-to-code-with-ari-in-oslo-and-london/"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> Email</a> <a class="article-open_shere-feed" href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/TroyHunt"> RSS</a> </section> <section class="article-open_author"> <div class="article-open_author_bio"> <p>Hi, I&apos;m Troy Hunt, I write this blog, create courses for Pluralsight and am a Microsoft Regional Director and MVP who travels the world speaking at events and training technology professionals <a href="/about" class="article_link-more fa fa-long-arrow-right"></a></p> </div> </section> </footer></div>
