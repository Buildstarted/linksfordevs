    <div id="p5833" class="post"> <p class="post-info">By glazou on Saturday 29 June 2019, 08:38 - <a href="http://www.glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?category/Privowny">Privowny</a> - <a href="http://www.glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?post/2019/06/29/zxcvbn-pv">Permalink</a> </p> <div class="post-content"><p>Back in 2012, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/wheeler">Dan Wheeler</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> released the excellent <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn">zxcvbn</a>, a password strength estimator inspired by password crackers, under an Open Source license. Pretty well done, fast and easily added to Web sites and Web apps, we at <a href="https://privowny.io/">Privowny</a> started being very interested by zxcvbn despite of a few issues:</p> <ul><li>the JavaScript code is transpiled from CofeeScript, and there are too many globals and old quirks made to accomodate old browsers we&apos;re not interested in</li> <li>it&apos;s en-US only, with keyboard definitions only for the US and word frequency lists only for the US</li> <li>return text messages are not localized and not easily localizable</li> <li>the transpiled JS is not easily readable nor easily extensible</li> </ul> <p>So we decided to rewrite it in a more modern JS:</p><div><ol><li>simpler to hack, maintain, extend. We also cleaned up a few things.</li> <li>far easier to internationalize. We added word frequency lists and AZERTY keyboard adjacency lists for fr-FR. Adding your own language is now just a matter of building lists and adding your data to two much more readable files.</li> <li>the warning and suggestions returned by zcvbn can now be very easily localized in any language (default is &quot;en&quot; but that&apos;s trivial to change). We added L10N for french.</li> <li>we also integrated the fast, reliable <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#PwnedPasswords">HaveIBeenPwned Password API</a>, as an optional extra. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/">Troy Hunt</a>, behind HaveIBeenPwned, just rocks! There is then a new score value of <code>-1</code> indicating a leaked password.</li> </ol> <div>Since the original code was OSS and to thank Dan and Dropbox for their original contribution, Privowny is now giving back its fork and is glad to release <a href="https://github.com/Privowny/zxcvbn-pv">zxcvbn-pv</a> under the very same original license on Github. Pull Requests, suggestions, comments, all highly welcome! We feel it&apos;s already usable but don&apos;t be too surprised if you still find an issue or a bug. Just let us know on GH? Thanks!</div></div></div> </div>
