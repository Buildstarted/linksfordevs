<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody">     
                <p>Toll Group is staying tight-lipped on what appears to be a large-scale ransomware attack that has infected a sizable part of its IT infrastructure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/toll-group-shuts-it-systems-after-cyber-security-incident-537401" target="_blank">The logistics giant first reported</a> that it was suffering from the effects of a “cyber security incident” on Friday last week.</p>

<p>That continued into this week with pickup and tracking systems, including its MyToll portal, offline.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/toll-group-hit-by-new-variant-of-mailto-ransomware-537537" target="_blank"><strong>Read the latest:&nbsp;Toll Group hit by "new variant" of Mailto ransomware</strong></a></p>

<p>A support line for MyToll reached by<em> iTnews</em> on Monday afternoon said it was “closed” and to email instead.</p>

<p>The company said in a statement that “as a precautionary measure, in response to a cybersecurity incident on Friday, Toll deliberately shut down a number of systems across multiple sites and business units.”</p>

<p>“Toll IT teams are working closely with global cyber security experts to resolve the issue,” it said.</p>

<p>“Our immediate focus is on bringing our systems back online in a controlled and secure manner.”</p>

<p>A source with knowledge of the incident told <em>iTnews</em> that the company has been hit with a sizable ransomware infection that is impacting global operations.</p>

<p>The source said that over 1000 servers had been infected, and that staff worldwide had been told to leave desktops and laptops switched off and disconnected from the corporate network.</p>

<p>The source said Active Directory, productivity and corporate VPN applications were among those infected and taken offline.</p>

<p>This appears to mesh with other reports of the incident sighted by <em>iTnews</em>, which claimed ransomware had infected systems in Toll’s main data centre; that the company had no IT systems operating; and that it was in the process of manually cleaning servers in an effort to bring them back online.</p>

<p><em>iTnews</em> put its understanding of the incident to Toll Group’s media representatives on Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company responded with a prepared statement that did not address any of the points.</p>

<p>It did not further respond to follow-up emails and calls made to several media representatives.</p>

<p>Toll Group’s IT operating model includes a sizable workforce outsourced to Infosys.</p>

<p>An Australian spokesperson for Infosys declined to comment on the incident, including whether its teams were involved in the recovery.</p>

<p>“As a matter of corporate policy, Infosys does not comment on client matters,” its spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Toll said it was “making progress” in its recovery efforts.</p>

<p>“Staying focused on customers remains at the forefront of Toll’s priorities as we restore our services and we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused,” it said.</p>

<p>“We want to thank our customers for their patience and support.”</p>

<p>Ransomware has been back in the spotlight in the early part of 2020 with high-profile attacks such as on <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/travelex-recovers-uk-website-after-ransomware-hit-537381" rel="noopener" target="_blank">foreign exchange firm Travelex</a>, which took the best part of a month to recover from. Travelex has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/01/09/travelex-refuses-say-paid-6m-ransom-hackers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">refused to say publicly</a> if it paid the $9 million ransom or not.</p>

<p>Total losses from malware can be much more substantial, however. A Petya malware infection <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/tnt-express-pegs-petya-losses-at-374m-473837" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cost fellow logistics firm TNT Express $374 million</a>, while staff at law firm DLA Piper put in <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/dla-piper-paid-15000-hours-of-it-overtime-after-notpetya-attack-490495" rel="noopener" target="_blank">15,000 hours of overtime</a> to recover from an encounter with the same piece of malware.</p>
