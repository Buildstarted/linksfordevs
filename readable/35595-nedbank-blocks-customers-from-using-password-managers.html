This is to allow us to resolve potential security vulnerabilities, and to ensure there is no negative impact on clients,” said Chatikobo.</p><p>“The temporary disablement is being done with customers in mind, to ensure Nedbank’s platforms remain secure and trustworthy at all times.”</p><p>Chatikobo did not say how long the measure would be in place.</p><h3>Controversy around autofill and password managers</h3><p>Nedbank is not the first South African bank to disable copy-and-paste password managers on their website.</p><p>FNB controversially <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/security/316189-fnb-users-can-no-longer-save-passwords-in-their-browser.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>blocked</strong></a> these password managers in August, claiming that the decision was made to ensure that users’ passwords remained secure.</p><p>“All stored passwords on your device can be viewed during a malware attack. Passwords can be easily accessed on your unattended/unlocked/stolen device,” said FNB.</p><p>Prominent security experts such as “Have I Been Pwned?” creator&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1163540704578031616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Troy Hunt</strong></a> were heavily critical of FNB’s decision, saying that it negatively affected user security.</p><p>This is because users would be forced to use simpler passwords which they can remember, which makes it exponentially easier for hackers to crack their credentials.</p><p>However, after users began developing <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/banking/316895-how-to-bypass-fnbs-password-manager-block.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>workarounds</strong></a> that allowed them to use password managers, FNB <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/banking/316921-fnb-reverses-decision-to-block-password-managers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>reversed its decision</strong></a>.</p><p>“We note with concern the recommendation to install unauthorised software and browser extensions by some users in a bid to circumvent the auto-filling of passwords,” said FNB head of digital banking Giuseppe Virgillito.</p><p>“The use of this type of software for your banking is strongly discouraged as it places the user at a high risk of introducing malicious software onto their device.”</p><p>“Alternatively, it also places users at an increased risk of phishing. As a consequence, hereof, we have decided to revisit the decision to prevent auto-filling of passwords at this time,” said Virgillito.</p></div></div></div></div>
