My goal has always been to have exactly 100 episodes.</p><p>As many of you know, we've had our 100th episode recorded (me telling my story) for a couple of years now. I didn't want to just release it skipping episodes #91-99. So I've started recording new episodes.</p><p>So far we have two new episodes with new ones coming in approximately weekly (depending on recording schedules).</p>

My wife has already heard all of my stories, so I have to start recording myself.</p><p>The idea with this series is to talk about the inner world of developers. I might dig into some technology, but usually in a more general way. I'm still getting used to shooting in my office, so bear with the giant head.</p><p>I'm going to do my best to do one of these each week.

Because I'm a .NET developer, my first instinct is always to just File-&gt;New an ASP.NET site. But should I?</p><p>Instead of using ASP.NET, these sites are typically one-pagers to promote something. I've done this with my <a href="https://helloworldfilm.com/">https://helloworldfilm.com</a>, <a href="https://imfinefilm.com/">https://imfinefilm.com</a>, and most recently my COVID-19 state-by-state tracking site: <a href="https://covidstates.azurewebsites.net/">https://covidstates.azurewebsites.net</a>.</p><p>The benefit of skipping ASP.NET in these cases is simplicity. They're just HTML/CSS/JS. Since I don't need any server-side code running, I just create the HTML and post it. Even in the cases of the film sites, I use widgets (in my case with MailChimp) to collect emails instead of doing the email work server-side.</p>
