[…]</p><p>Evan was willing to try anything to get users. When he was home in Pacific Palisades, <strong>he would go to the shopping mall and hand out flyers advertising Snapchat.</strong> “I would walk up to people and say, ‘Hey would you like to send a disappearing picture?’ and they would say, ‘No,’” Evan later recalled. </p><p>— <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Turn-Down-Billion-Dollars/dp/1250108616">How to Turn Down a Billion Dollars, The Snapchat Story</a> by Billy Gallagher</p></blockquote><h4>Neighborhood HOAs — Nextdoor</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2df11107-8f0a-493f-9741-310426bf4978_810x540.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2df11107-8f0a-493f-9741-310426bf4978_810x540.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2df11107-8f0a-493f-9741-310426bf4978_810x540.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:540,&quot;width&quot;:810,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><blockquote><p>Back then, the founding team knew that it would only work if they could find a neighborhood to embrace the idea of a social network for neighborhoods, as well as test it along the way. Choosing the right neighborhood was essential.</p><p>That neighborhood is known as Lorelei. Nestled close to the Bay on streets shaded by trees, the neighborhood was close-knit and small yet vibrant, with the longest-standing homeowner’s association in the state of California. The community already had some ways to communicate with each other, which was a promising sign. <strong>We reached out to board members of the homeowners association, and they were more than willing to hear us out.</strong> After an initial conversation, they invited us to present the concept to more residents at their next board meeting.</p><p>— <a href="https://blog.nextdoor.com/2017/05/22/celebrating-lorelei-americas-first-nextdoor-neighborhood/">Sarah Leary</a></p></blockquote><h4>Craft fairs — Etsy</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87cad1ca-a2ce-4390-8cd2-e5c42ec1c986_1024x683.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87cad1ca-a2ce-4390-8cd2-e5c42ec1c986_1024x683.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/87cad1ca-a2ce-4390-8cd2-e5c42ec1c986_1024x683.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:683,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:386254,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><blockquote><p>Etsy decided to actually <strong>go into all these fairs across the United States</strong>, having people travel to all these craft fairs and recruit sellers because the sellers would eventually recruit their own buyers to the website instead of just using digital marketing.</p><p>— <a href="https://hbr.org/podcast/2019/04/the-right-way-to-get-your-first-1000-customers">Thales Teixeira</a></p></blockquote><h4><strong>Apple stores — Pinterest </strong></h4><blockquote><p>We did all kinds of pretty desperate things, honestly. I used to walk by the Apple store on the way home. <strong>I’d go in and change all the computers to say Pinterest</strong>. Then just kind of stand in the back and be like, “Wow, this Pinterest thing, it’s really blowing up.”</p><p>— <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/ben-silbermann-at-startup-school/">Ben Silbermann</a></p></blockquote><p><em>(Note: This strategy will obviously be less effective while we shelter-in-place </em>😷<em>) </em></p><h2>2.

You could make the application name really really long. And the search engine on the App Store gives more weight to the application name rather than the keybookwords defined. So we put a really long application name, "make awesome music videos with all kinds of effects for Instagram, Facebook, Messenger”. And then traffic came from the search engine. That's how we initially got started.</p><p>— <a href="https://news.greylock.com/productsf-2016-b753fa9159b8">Alex Zhu</a></p></blockquote><h4><strong>ProductHunt — Loom</strong></h4><blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>First ~3k</strong> came in from Product Hunt on launch day + 1-2 days after. </p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>3k-20k</strong>: Came from early champions at organizations (we tried to build 1:1 relationships with all of them).</p></li><li><p><strong>21k+</strong>: we introduced our referral system ($5 in credits for every coworker you refer up to $50)</p></li></ul><p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/_shahedk/status/1252353316861820929">Shahed Khan</a></p></blockquote><h4>Piggy-back off of an existing online community — Netflix and Buffer</h4><blockquote><p>To help us connect further with customers, we brought in Corey Bridges to work on customer acquisition – or, more specifically, on something we jokingly called Black ops. A one-time English major at Berkely, he was a brilliant writer with a gift for creating characters. </p><p>He'd realized, early on, that <strong>the only way to find DVD owners was in the fringe communities of the internet: user groups, bulletin boards, web forums, and all of the other digital watering holes where enthusiasts met up</strong>. <strong>Corey's plan was to infiltrate these communities.</strong> He wouldn't announce himself as a Netflix employee. Posing as a home theater enthusiast or cinephile, he would join the conversation in communities geared toward DVD fanatics and movie buffs, befriend the major players, and slowly, over time, alert the most respected commenters, moderators, and website owners about this great new site called Netflix. <strong>We were months from launch, but he was planting seeds that would pay off...big time</strong>.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.amazon.com/That-Will-Never-Work-Netflix/dp/0316530204/ref=nodl_">That Will Never Work</a> by Marc Randolph (Netflix)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Solely through guest blogging we’ve acquired around 100,000 users</strong> within the first 9 months of running Buffer. Here is more on this number, a bit before we hit the 100,000. It’s been something that was very gradual though. Within the space of around 9 months, I wrote around 150 guest posts. Of course the early ones barely drove any traffic and only very gradually did things improve, I think that’s very important to understand. It will take a while until you can find the right frequency of posting. </p><p>— <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2012/07/26/how-guest-posting-propelled-one-site-from-0-to-100000-customers/">Leo Widrich</a> (Buffer)</p></blockquote><h2>3. Invite your friends</h2><p><strong>Key question: </strong>Do your friends fit into the target user group? If so, have you invited them yet?</p><h4>Yelp</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Inviting people from our network (mostly former coworkers from PayPal) drove our initial users</strong>. We asked all our network to invite their friends, and being startup people who wanted to help us, they obliged, so two-degrees out we probably got to 1k or so users. The takeaway is not to underestimate the power of one's personal referral network and to think deeply about the incentive and mechanics.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/russel-simmons-9562/">Russel Simmons</a></p></blockquote><h4>Lyft</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee35622f-e3a1-4a98-acf3-bb97542136fc_2172x1530.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee35622f-e3a1-4a98-acf3-bb97542136fc_2172x1530.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ee35622f-e3a1-4a98-acf3-bb97542136fc_2172x1530.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1026,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:556,&quot;bytes&quot;:672172,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><blockquote><p>Before the waitlists came <strong>personal email invites to our friends,</strong> like the one above.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilycwarren/">Emily Castor Warren</a></p></blockquote><h4><strong>Facebook</strong></h4><blockquote><p>Thefacebook.com went up on Wednesday, February 4, 2004. “It was a normal night in the dorm,” Moskovitz recalled. “When Mark finished the site, <strong>we told a couple of friends. And then one of them suggested putting it on the Kirkland House online mailing list</strong>, which was, like, three hundred people.
