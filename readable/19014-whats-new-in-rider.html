                            with some very exciting new features.</p><p>First, we’ve <strong>introduced performance indicators</strong>. Rider will highlight
                            event functions that are called each frame, such as <em>Update</em>, <em>FixedUpdate</em>,
                            and <em>LateUpdate</em>, as well as coroutine methods.</p><p>Second, we’ve extended our <strong>Find Usages</strong> with data pulled from Unity scenes,
                            assets, and prefabs. If you search for a class or method used as an event handler,
                            Rider will show where it’s used in your Unity files, grouped by type,
                            component name, and parent game objects. Even better, double clicking the item will
                                highlight the usage directly in the Unity Editor.</p><p>Pulling this information from Unity files also means that Rider will now <strong>correctly
                            highlight event handler methods as being implicitly used</strong>. We’ve moved the
                            <em>implicit usage</em> highlights from the text editor gutter icons and
                            turned them into Code Vision links, so you can see at a glance what
                            classes, methods, and fields are implicitly used by Unity. And clicking the link
                            will find those usages, even inside Unity files.</p><p>The debugger learned more about Unity, too, and is now able to <strong>show
                            extra data for Unity objects</strong>. It can also give you data for <strong>raw
                            pointers</strong>, which is helpful for examining native containers in ECS jobs.
