    <h1>Becoming a Microsoft MVP</h1>
    <div class="entry-content"><p>On November 1, 2019, I received an email stating that I had been awarded Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies for my community contributions.</p> <p>I was actually in a conference call with some work folks when I received the email, and I may have - MAY - have got a little excited and interjected that I had received it. Okay, not &#x201C;may&#x201D;, definitely &#x201C;did&#x201D;.</p> <p>I was nominated back in June (or July?) of 2019, so I knew I was &#x201C;in the system&#x201D;. I regularly had to go and log contributions into the website for things that I had done. And, that&#x2019;s when it hit me. I hadn&#x2019;t <em>just</em> got nominated for <em>current</em> contributions. You see, I had to log, approximately, the last year&#x2019;s worth. I realized while doing that, that I had been doing some of those things for a while. And, while I most likely said to myself at some point, &#x201C;let&#x2019;s go for MVP&#x201D;, I had been working towards it for quite some time without necessarily realizing it.</p> <p>Why is that?</p> <p>Because I was doing what I loved doing. It just so happens that a lot of what I love doing, overlaps into MVP territory.</p> <p>You see, I had started submitting PRs against documentation to various repositories (though, honestly, mostly Microsoft docs because thats usually where I spend most of my time). I started open sourcing my own creations (you can find them on my <a href="https://luv2.dev/github">github profile</a>). Some of those creations were developed on my <a href="http://live.codingwithcalvin.tv">live stream</a> (which I also started during that time frame). Of course, one of the unfortunate things about streaming on Twitch is that the videos will &#x201C;disappear&#x201D; after a short time period, so I also ending up starting a <a href="http://archive.codingwithcalvin.tv">YouTube channel</a> where I push all of the recordingsI made conscious decisions to volunteer in the community, because, well, I love the community. Then, I started a <a href="https://www.dotnetbytes.fm">podcast</a> - because one has to these days, but also because I think its fun (we just released our 11th episode!).</p> <p>What I&#x2019;m saying is, I was going for MVP and didn&#x2019;t even realize it until much later because I was making the contributions <em>to help others</em> and <em>have fun</em>. I hope that&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;ll get it, too.</p> <p>If you have questions, please feel free to reach out - comment here, twitter, email, etc., whatever works best for you.</p>
