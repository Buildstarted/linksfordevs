				<p>So…after quite a serious thing which was writing <a href="https://prodotnetmemory.com/">Pro .NET Memory Management book</a>, I’ve decided to experiment with a little pet project for having some more fun. I have quite a few very interesting ideas going on in my head. Yet, I needed to choose one!</p>
<p>And that’s how an idea of <strong>OutOfMemory</strong> game prototype materialized! Ladies and gentleman, please meet<strong> the first in the world card game about .NET-based high performance and memory-aware programming</strong>. Sounds so nerdy, doesn’t it?! That’s by design and I like it! From developer to developers, with love 😉 It contains a huge amount of stuff related to programming, hardware architecture and… GC obviously! <strong>This is going to be a physical card game</strong>, not a computer or a mobile one.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to build an application. You build it by playing on the table so-called <strong>Feature</strong> cards – the first player getting a given amount of <strong>Feature</strong> points wins!</p>
<p><a href="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype01.png"><img src="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype01.png" alt="prototype01" width="650" height="325" srcset="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype01.png 650w, http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype01-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></a></p>
<p>But each <strong>Feature</strong> has its cost! Each <strong>Feature</strong> card allocates <strong>Memory</strong> and consumes CPU <strong>Ticks</strong>. At the end of each player’s turn, you add an appropriate amount of <strong>Memory</strong>. If you hit a given limit – OutOfMemory occurs! CPU <strong>Ticks</strong> play also an important role in limiting possible actions in a turn.</p>
<p>In each turn, the player takes a single card from a deck. Or two, if she has an appropriate special card which is… <a href="https://adamsitnik.com/">Adam Sitnik</a>‘s card (an example of a Hero card). Another example of .NET Hero card is Ben Adams – very powerful as it both reduces <strong>Memory</strong> and CPU <strong>Ticks</strong>, has a special <strong>ability</strong> (removes all the nasty <strong>Issues</strong>&nbsp;played against you by your opponents) and even adds a single <strong>Feature</strong> point (having Ben contributing to your app is a feature by itself)!<a href="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype02.png"><br>
</a></p>
<p><a href="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype02b.png"><img src="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype02b.png" alt="prototype02b" width="360" height="232" srcset="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype02b.png 360w, http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype02b-300x193.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"></a></p>
<p>Guess who is on the other Hero cards?! Currently, I plan eight such cards!</p>
<p>Card(s) taken from the deck can be used immediately or kept at hand (but there is a limit of cards in hand, reflecting CPU cache my dear!)</p>
<p>There are various other types of cards. For example, there are Garbage Collection <strong>Action</strong> cards so if you are lucky enough (and plan to keep them in advance) you can clean your <strong>Memory</strong> periodically.</p>
<p><a href="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype03.png"><img src="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype03.png" alt="prototype03" width="750" height="247" srcset="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype03.png 750w, http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype03-300x99.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></a></p>
<p>A lot of cards help you to keep <strong>Features</strong> while reducing their <strong>Memory</strong> and/or <strong>Ticks</strong> costs, like Span&lt;T&gt; or Lock-free programming<a href="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype04.png"><br>
</a></p>
<p><a href="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype04.png"><img src="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype04.png" alt="prototype04" width="550" height="244" srcset="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype04.png 550w, http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype04-300x133.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></a></p>
<p>There are also nasty <strong>Bug</strong> and <strong>Issue</strong> cards that you can play against your opponents, removing their <strong>Feature</strong> points or making their app more allocating and slower!</p>
<p><a href="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype05b.png"><img src="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype05b.png" alt="prototype05b" width="550" height="240" srcset="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype05b.png 550w, http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype05b-300x131.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></a></p>
<p>Additionally, there are various <strong>Action</strong> cards that can be played to receive a short, single-turn benefit. Some influence only you, some a given opponent, and some all the players – like Black Friday cards that makes all Features double-allocating in the next turn (due to high volume traffic!).</p>
<p><a href="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype06.png"><img src="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype06.png" alt="prototype06" width="360" height="241" srcset="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype06.png 360w, http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype06-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"></a></p>
<p>All this is in a very early prototype stage, requiring possibly quite a lot of rethinking. And a lot of balancing is required to create playable and enjoyable deck. Currently, my prototype consists of 80 cards.</p>
<p><a href="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype07.jpg"><img src="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype07.jpg" alt="prototype07" width="650" height="366" srcset="http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype07.jpg 650w, http://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/prototype07-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></a></p>
<p>I am playing this game a lot with… myself, to balance the very first prototype. When ready, <strong>I plan to publish self-printable very rough version</strong> and I hope there will be .NET developers out there willing to try it out! With your feedback, we may create an amazing game!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <strong>I would LOVE to start receiving your feedback RIGHT away</strong>! Do you like this idea? Do you have ideas of Hero, Bug, Issue, Fix and Feature cards?</p>

<p>Note also that this initiative is a part of a bigger <a href="https://conf.dotnetos.org/">Dotnetos initiative</a>&nbsp;– although currently only I am involved in the design of this game, most probably sooner or later&nbsp;all three Dotnetos will be somehow involved in it – I hope so!</p>
<p><em>Note. <strong>All graphics on cards and the cards itself are prototypes and do not reflect the final quality</strong>. Moreover, all cliparts were taken from Free Vectors via <a href="https://www.vecteezy.com/">vecteezy.com</a>.</em></p>
