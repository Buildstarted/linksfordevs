      <p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/wtax.html">Paul Graham wrote an article about wealth tax</a>. In the article he ‘models’ the effect of a wealth tax on the fortune of a person. His assumption for the modeling is a person who earned a lot of money with a startup in her 20s. Paul Graham shows how much of the earned stocks/money would be taken by the government by a wealth tax.</p>
<p>Paul Graham comes to the conclusion that wealth taxes have “dramatic effects” and that “even a .5% wealth tax would start to keep founders away from a state or country that imposed it.”</p>
<p>I think this conclusion is wrong. His model assumes that the earned money just lies on a big pile and is not used for 60 years. A more reasonable model would include interest being earn with the money. For this I will use an extended model:</p>
<p><code>(growth * (1-wealth_tax)^years</code></p>
<p>If we assume a reasonable return of investment of 2% per year the number shifts dramatically. Instead of “losing” 25% at 0.5% wealth tax you end up with 242% of your original value after 60 years. Even a wealth tax of 3% would only half your wealth.</p>

<p>Paul Graham’s article also misses to mention that a wealth tax only affect people with ALOT of money. Elizabeth Warren’s <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax">“Ultra-Millionaire Tax”</a> would only tax assets over $50 million. Once you are affected by a wealth tax you have enough money to live a luxurious life (and your children will probably never have to work to live). Most startup founders never reach this amount of wealth.</p>
<p>As this tax only targets the super rich let’s look at the effect this tax would have on Jeff Bezos (data source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos">Wikipedia</a>):</p>

  </figure>
</div>

<p>Even a high wealth tax of 5% leaves Bezos the majority of his wealth. If Bezos stopped earning new wealth in 2018 he could bequeath $30 billion to his children in 2080 with a 2% wealth tax. With a 5% wealth tax his children would still inherit over $4 billion!</p>
<p>The questions I’m asking myself when thinking about a wealth tax are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should a person have virtually unlimited resources for the rest of her life, just because she had a clever idea in her 20s?</li>
<li>Should children have virtually unlimited resources for the rest of their lives, just because one of their parents had a clever idea in her 20s?</li>
<li>Should grandchildren have virtually unlimited resources for the rest of their lives, just because one of their grandparents had a clever idea in her 20s?</li>
</ul>
