<p>While working on an issue in Codespaces, I figured this would be a good case to implement some regex. Each time I work with regex I need to figure out how it works again, but also each time I am impressed with how powerful it is. And actually, this time I learned something new: regex named groups. Regex has the ability to name each matched group which is very easy to subsequently use in C# code. In this post, I will tell you how to do exactly that.</p>



<h2>Outline</h2>



<p>The issue I was working on had to do with Azure DevOps URLs. Apparently, the Azure DevOps URL should be formatted like <code>https://myaccount@dev.azure.com/myaccount/foo/bar</code> in order to work properly while using git.</p>



<p>But as youâ€™re just remembering a URL, itâ€™s very easy to simply switch to <code>https://dev.azure.com/myaccount/foo/bar</code>. However, this will fail your git clone. Since the part right after the domain is the same thing we need in front with the @ sign, we could at least give it some attempt to unblock our user here.</p>



<h2>First Attempt without Regex Named Groups</h2>



<p>For a first attempt I simple started to split the string. Since you can probably use http and https, or even leave the protocol out, I would go look for <code>dev.azure.com</code>. Split that. Then find the next <code>/</code>, but maybe there is no next <code>/</code> indices, lengths, putting it together againâ€¦ The code for this started to become very verbose for something seemingly simple. There had to be another way.</p>



<h2>Enter Regex </h2>



<p>Then I remembered regex! As mentioned before; each time I do something with regex I need to relearn it, but once you got the hang of it, that will go faster each time. At the same time, whenever I do some work with regex I remember how powerful it is! This time I would even discover a feature that makes it more powerful than I realized.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Pretty quickly I came up with a regex pattern like this: <code>(http[s]?://)*(dev.azure.com/([a-zA-Z]*)(.*))</code> which will recognize all kinds of variations without having to account for them in code.</p>



<p>I wonâ€™t go into all the things of regex, you can write a book about that. But some tools and references that can help you with this are <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://regexr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://regexr.com/</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://regexstorm.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://regexstorm.net/</a>. Note that there are some dialects in regex. For instance, when using regexr, youâ€™ll need to escape the forward slashes with a backslash (like <code>http://</code>).</p>



<p>The thing I will say is that each portion in brackets will show up in a separate group. But some groups are optional, so this presented a problem; I still needed to write code to see if all the necessary parts are there.</p>



<h3>Regex Named Groups to the rescue</h3>



<p>As it turns out, you can <em>name</em> each group. By simply putting <code>?&lt;yourname&gt;</code> right after the opening bracket you can refer to the group by its name. The resulting expression would be something like this: <code>(?&lt;protocol&gt;http[s]?://)*(?&lt;domainandpath&gt;dev.azure.com/(?&lt;accountname&gt;[a-zA-Z]*)(.*))</code></p>



<p>You can see that there is one nested group. Since I donâ€™t care what is after the account name, I put that in one big group that I can simply re-add in the new URL as a whole.</p>



<p>When we put this together in C# code it looks like below.</p>

<p>We see if there is a match, including the group names. When there are, we rebuild the URL through these group names. The cool thing being we can just reference them by their string index in the C# collection ðŸ¤¯.</p>



<h2>In Closing</h2>



<p>Pretty cool and powerful, right?</p>



<p>Another thing that helped my iterating over this pretty fast is <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://try.dot.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">try.dot.net</a>. This little website lets you run C# code as if it were a console application. Just take the code from above (add <code>using System.Text.RegularExpressions;</code> at the top) and run it! You can quickly iterate over it to see if you get the right results and then put it in your codebase. It seems from <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/try-dotnet" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the website</a> that you will be able to embed these code runners in your browser at a later stage. #awesomesauce!</p>
