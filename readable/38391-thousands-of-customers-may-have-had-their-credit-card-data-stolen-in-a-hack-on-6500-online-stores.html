class="mol-para-with-font">That code was designed to record and transfer credit card numbers entered into online forms and was embedded into Volusion's servers this week.</p><div><p class="mol-para-with-font">MailOnline's request for comment on the breach was not returned before time of publication.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to ZDNet, the hack qualifies as what's

e-commerce.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Attackers typically target online stores with the goal of scraping and stealing credit card information.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">The number of such attacks has been growing in recent years with many companies unaware that their servers have been compromised.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Hacks may persist for weeks, months, or even years without being noticed.&nbsp;</p></div></div><p class="mol-para-with-font">The number of such hacks has been increasing, researchers say, and has affected more than 18,000 online stores in the pas few months.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">A now infamous Magecart attack on British Airways compromised nearly 400,000 customers' credit car information last year.&nbsp;</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">According to the security firm <a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.riskiq.com/blog/external-threat-management/magecart-growing-threat/">RiskIQ</a>, Magecart hacks have become particularly perilous for e-commerce companies since they often don't have access to the underlying code that runs their online stores.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">This allows hackers to remain undetected in servers for long periods of time that can range from weeks, to months, or even years.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">'Skimming code can exist on a breached website for weeks, months, or even indefinitely, victimizing any visitor that makes purchases on that site,' writes RiskIQ.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><mol-permabox id="mol-919d5930-ea12-11e9-a29d-ddac22a6e847"><div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2"
