But many of you, like me, are facing this as a new reality. This means increased work as we juggle working from home with our families, or increased spare time on our hands that we weren’t expecting.</p><p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/03/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200324172505257_COVER-scaled.jpg" data-featherlight="image"> <img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/03/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200324172505257_COVER-scaled.jpg" alt="Image 00100dPORTRAIT 00100 BURST20200324172505257 COVER" width="2048" height="1536" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/03/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200324172505257_COVER-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/03/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200324172505257_COVER-300x225.jpg 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/03/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200324172505257_COVER-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/03/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200324172505257_COVER-768x576.jpg 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/03/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200324172505257_COVER-1536x1152.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"> </a><span>My cat Nika, attempting to cut off my access to the outside world</span></p><p>COVID-19 continues to impact the lives of people around the world. The Visual Studio Subscriptions team wants to do everything we can to support you, wherever you’re at during this tough time. We’ve got some suggestions for staying productive at home, and ways that you can take advantage of benefits in your Visual Studio subscription to maximize this time of great uncertainty.</p><p>Almost everything we’re sharing can be accessed right from your subscription, so just sign into the <a href="https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits" target="_blank">subscriptions portal</a> to get started.</p><h4><strong>Monthly Azure Dev/Test Individual Credit</strong></h4><p>Many subscriptions include a monthly Azure credit of up to $150 that you can use to explore and try Azure services, including: Visual Studio Online, Windows Virtual Desktop, and Azure Functions to name a few. You can also use your credit to create your first bot or leverage speech service to add speech recognition to an app. Check out some <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/#azure-credits" target="_blank">other usage scenarios</a> and get started by activating your credit in the <a href="https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits" target="_blank">subscriptions portal</a>.</p><p>When you reach the monthly cap for your credits, your Azure services will stop until your next monthly credits are added, no additional cost.</p><p>In some regions, you may see less options available than usual – in the event of capacity constraints, Azure prioritizes services for first responders, health and emergency management services, critical government infrastructure organizational use, and ensuring remote workers stay up and running. Read more about Azure’s <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/our-commitment-to-customers-and-microsoft-cloud-services-continuity/" target="_blank">commitment to customers and Microsoft cloud services continuity.</a></p><h4><strong>Training</strong></h4><p>Use your downtime to build new skills—<strong>Pluralsight</strong> allows you to learn anytime, anywhere, even without an internet connection. If you’re tired of sitting in front of your computer all day, you can sit on your couch with the cat and use apps to stream over 7000 courses to your TV, learning about topics such as: cloud, mobile, security, IT and data. Visual Studio subscribers are eligible for up to six months of free access to Pluralsight courses. Activate your benefit by clicking on the Pluralsight tile in the <a href="https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits" target="_blank">subscriber portal</a>. Check out this <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/remote-work-guide" target="_blank">remote work guide</a> from Pluralsight for some great tips and tools to make the most of working from home.</p><p>Enhance your skills with expert-led, online video tutorials from industry experts through <strong>LinkedIn Learning</strong>. You can sign up for the free trial or activate the LinkedIn Learning benefit included in selected Visual Studio subscriptions. Check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/remote-working-setting-yourself-and-your-teams-up-for-success?u=104" target="_blank">16 LinkedIn Learning courses available</a> for free, including tips on how to: stay productive, build relationships when you’re not face-to-face, use virtual meeting tools, and balance family and work dynamics in a healthy way.</p><p>Increase your data science skills from the comfort of your browser with <strong>DataCamp</strong> to learn all the data science skills you need from the comfort of your browser. You choose when and what you learn, with no software to install and no special hardware requirements.</p><h4><strong>Visual Studio </strong></h4><p>If you have a Visual Studio subscription and need to develop at home, you can download it to your home computer and use Visual Studio the same way you do in the office. Make sure your company’s policy allows for this, and don’t forget—only users with an appropriate Visual Studio subscription can use the software.</p><h4><strong>Visual Studio Online</strong></h4><p>If you don’t have access to a development environment at home, or don’t have the hardware to support Virtual Machines, cloud services can help. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/online/overview/what-is-vsonline" target="_blank">Visual Studio Online</a>&nbsp;is a service that creates cloud-hosted dev environments from any hosted Git repo. You can connect to these environments directly from Visual Studio Code (Visual Studio is in private preview), which provides an experience that looks and feels local. You can also use the built-in browser-based editor, which works on any device. For tasks that require access to specialized hardware, devs can&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/online/how-to/vscode#self-hosted" target="_blank">link their existing&nbsp;machine</a>&nbsp;to Visual Studio Online. You can also use your monthly Azure individual dev/test credit for this service.</p><h4><strong>Visual Studio Live Share</strong></h4><p>Working&nbsp;remotely can be a challenge if you&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;peer reviews&nbsp;or&nbsp;pair programming, where&nbsp;you&nbsp;would normally&nbsp;sit&nbsp;side by side&nbsp;and&nbsp;learn&nbsp;from each other.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;developers&nbsp;use&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/liveshare/quickstart/share" target="_blank">Visual Studio Live Share</a>&nbsp;for joint debugging sessions and peer learning. Live Share allows you to work together and independently, and feels a lot like in-person collaboration.</p><h4><strong>Teams</strong></h4><p>All of us at Microsoft use Teams daily for chat, meetings, calls, and collaboration. Now that we find ourselves working remotely, every meeting is now a Teams meeting. Our team has even started a coffee chat each morning, where those water cooler conversations happen online. I’ve seen online lunches and happy hour meet-ups too!</p><p>Teams is part of&nbsp;Office 365. If your organization is licensed for&nbsp;Office 365, you already have it. But Microsoft wants to make sure everyone has access to it during this time.
