The data &#x2013; customer names, email addresses, dates of birth and betting records &#x2013; was discovered in December by an anonymous source who tipped off Australian security researcher <strong>Troy Hunt</strong>.</p><p>Hunt, who runs the haveibeenpwned.com service, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-difficulty-of-disclosure-surebet247-and-the-streisand-effect/">confirmed</a> that at least some of the names in the database &#x2013; including a German citizen living in Germany, raising concerns of violations of the European Union&#x2019;s General Data Protection Regulation &#x2013; had indeed registered with SureBet247 and that the personal information in the data Hunt received was accurate.</p><p>Convinced that the data was genuine, Hunt attempted to contact SureBet247&#x2019;s parent company ChessPlus International Ltd without success. Hunt then contacted iAfrikan&#x2019;s <strong>Tefo Mohapi</strong>, who was able to contact SureBet247, but received what he charitably described as a &#x201C;nonchalant&#x201D; response.</p><p>On January 4, SureBet247&#x2019;s official Twitter account urged followers to &#x201C;kindly ignore the information going round about a hack into our system.&#x201D; The tweet went on to say that all &#x201C;sensitive private and financial information are stored on a secured server and protected by the best firewall to prevent intrusions.&#x201D;</p><p>SureBet247 appears to have made this claim without ever seeing the data that both Mohapi and Hunt tried to discuss with the company. SureBet247&#x2019;s Twitter also blocked the accounts of Mohapi, Hunt and any customer who subsequently confirmed their information was among the data Hunt received.</p><p>Also on January 4, SureBet247&#x2019;s managing director <strong>Sheriff Olaniyan</strong> <a href="https://www.iafrikan.com/2020/01/06/nigeria-data-protection-regulation-surebet247-national-information-technology-development-agency-nitda-breach-security-leak-soccer-betting-sports-gambling/">sent iAfrikan a message</a> saying SureBet247&#x2019;s management &#x201C;seriously frown at this malicious news been [sic] promoted by your organization.&#x201D; Olaniyan denied that any customer data had been &#x201C;breached or exposed&#x201D; and called iAfrikan&#x2019;s reporting &#x201C;pure blackmail.&#x201D;</p><p>Olaniyan also claimed that the anonymous individual who came forward with the data breach &#x201C;was asking for payment and this was demanded from us.&#x201D; Both Hunt and Mohapi concluded that the company was almost certainly the target of a shakedown but that didn&#x2019;t negate the fact that sensitive data had been obtained.</p><p>On Monday, <a href="https://businessday.ng/technology/article/nitda-moves-to-investigate-alleged-leak-of-surebet247-customers-data/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">Nigerian media</a> reported that the country&#x2019;s National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) had asked its Data Breach Investigation Team to look into the matter.</p><p>While SureBet247 customers represented the bulk of the stolen data, files bearing the names of several other betting operators &#x2013; including <strong>BetAlfa</strong>, <strong>BetWay</strong>, <strong>BongoBongo</strong> and <strong>TopBet</strong> &#x2013; also appeared in the compromised data that Hunt received. Mohapi&#x2019;s attempts to contact any of these operators were also met with silence.</p> <h3>Comments</h3></div>
