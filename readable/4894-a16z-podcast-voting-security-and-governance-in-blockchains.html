It’s the natural human tendency for how to organize decisions, and in distributed systems without centralized middlemen, it’s the only clear Schelling point we can come up with.</p><p>But too many people design voting mechanisms in distributed systems <em>in isolation</em> — sometimes naively “porting over” assumptions from the real world or from simple cryptoeconomic models without thinking through the economic adversaries present in a larger, more rational (vs. “honest”) game-theoretic system.&nbsp;So how are blockchain systems different from real-world paper and electronic voting systems? How can such systems be gamed, and what are the implications for cryptoeconomic security… as well as the governance of distributed organizations?</p><p>This hallway-style episode of the a16z Podcast covers all this and more. Recorded as part of our NYC roadtrip, it features Cornell Tech PhD student and software engineer&nbsp;<a href="https://pdaian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phil Daian</a>, who researches applied cryptography and smart contracts — and who also wrote about “<a href="http://hackingdistributed.com/2018/07/02/on-chain-vote-buying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On-chain Vote Buying and the Rise of Dark DAOs</a>” in 2018 (with&nbsp;Tyler Kell, Ian Miers, and his advisor Ari Juels). Daian is joined by a16z crypto partner Ali Yahya (previously a software engineer and machine learning researcher at GoogleX and Google Brain), who also recently presented on crypto as the evolution — and future — <a href="https://a16z.com/2018/12/16/future-trust-crypto-summit-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of trust</a>.</p><p><span class="footnote"><span>The views expressed herein are those of the individual personnel quoted herein.&nbsp;</span><span>This presentation is provided solely for informational purposes and should not be relied upon&nbsp;</span><span>when making any investment decision.
