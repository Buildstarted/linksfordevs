<p>This is an asynchronous chat that sends + receives messages in the browser with no reloads and no javascript.</p>
<h2>Ok so how</h2>
<p>Background-images loaded via pseudoselectors + a forever-loading index page (remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)" rel="nofollow">Comet</a>?).</p>
<h2>Say that again?</h2>
<p>Ok, so there are two things we need the browser to do: send data and receive data.  Let's start with the first.</p>
<h3>Sending Data</h3>
<p>CSS is really limited in what it can do.  However, we <em>can</em> use it to effectively detect button presses:</p>
<pre><code>.some-button:active {
  background-image: url('some_image.jpg')
}
</code></pre>
<p>What's cool is that a browser won't actually load that background image until this selector is used - that is, when this button is pressed.  So now we have a way to trigger a request to a server of our choice on a button press.  That sounds like data sending!</p>
<p>Now, of course, this only works once per button (since a browser won't try to load that image twice), but it's a start.</p>
<h3>Receiving Data</h3>
<p>Since we can't use JS, it's really hard to change a page after it's already been loaded.  But it <em>is</em> possible.</p>
<p>Back before websockets were widely supported, we had to use clever hacks if we wanted to push data from a server to a client in an ongoing basis.  One such hack was just to make the page never finish loading.  It turns out that you can tell the browser to start rendering a page before it's finished loading (using the <code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code> http header).  And when you do that, you don't <em>actually</em> have to stop loading the page.  You can just keep adding stuff to the bottom of the html forever, at whatever rate you want.</p>
<p>So, for example, you could start sending a normal html page, then just stop sending html (while still telling the client you're sending) until you're ready to deliver another message.</p>
<p>Now, all this lets us do is periodically append html to the page.  What can we do with that?  How about, when you load the index page, this happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>We load up the first pile of html we want to show.  A welcome message, etc.</li>
<li>We stop loading html for a while until we want to send some sort of update.</li>
<li>Now we load up a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element that <code>display: none</code>'s all the previous html</li>
<li>Then we load up whatever <em>new</em> html we want to show</li>
<li>Finally we wait until the next update we want to send and GOTO 3.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Single-use buttons?</h3>
<p>Ok, so we have that problem earlier where each button is only single-use.  It tries to send a get request once, then never will again.</p>
<p>Thankfully, our method of receiving data fixes that for us.  Here's what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>We show an "a" button whose background image is like "img/a".</li>
<li>When you press it, the server receives the image request for "a"</li>
<li>The server then pushes an update to the client to hide the current button and replace it with one whose background images is "image/aa".</li>
</ol>
<p>If the buttons you pressed were "h", "e", and "l", then the "a" button's background image url would be "img/hela".  And since we're replacing all buttons every time you press one, the single-use button problem goes away!</p>
<h3>Misc other details</h3>
<ul>
<li>We actually encode a bit more info into the button urls (like each client's id)</li>
<li>Because the data-sending and data-receiving happens on different threads, we need inter-thread communication.  That sounds like work, so we'll just use Redis pubsub for that.</li>
</ul>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>What inspired this?</strong> Chernobyl, Hindenburg, The Tacoma Narrows Bridge...</p>
<p><strong>Really?</strong> No, it was this <a href="https://twitter.com/davywtf/status/1124130932573839360" rel="nofollow">clever tweet</a> by davywtf.</p>
<p><strong>Why's your code suck</strong> Why do <em>you</em> suck?</p>
<p><strong>No but really</strong> Because I was mostly making this up as I went.  There's a lot of exploratory coding here that I only minimally cleaned up.  If I rebuilt it I'd store the UI state for a client in redis and just push it out in its entirety when needed via a single generic screen-updating mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>What could go wrong with this technique?</strong> Broken by browser bg-image handling changes; long-request timeouts; running out of threads; fast-clicking bugs; generic concurrency headaches; poor handling by proxies; it's crazy inaccessible; etc etc</p>
<p><strong>Should I use this in real life?</strong> Dear god yes.</p>
<p><strong>I have an idea for how this could be made better/worse/hackier</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/kkuchta" rel="nofollow">Tweet at me (@kkuchta)</a>.  I'm always down to see a terrible idea taken further!</p>
<h3>Practical Details</h3>
<p>If you want to install and use this locally you should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Re-evaluate your life choices</li>
<li>If you simply must continue, check out INSTALL.md</li>
