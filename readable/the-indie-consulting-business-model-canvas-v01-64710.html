  <p>Earlier this week we ran a highly experimental session around defining and mapping out an indie consulting business model canvas.</p>

<p>Indies unfortunately are starved for any kind of ‚Äúreview‚Äù of their business - no peers, no colleagues, no performance review, and sometimes no time to reflect. This work can be incredibly useful - to just stop and reflect on your own practice. Especially on where you might want to evolve / grow your practice in the future.</p>

<p>So I created a template for spending some time with your business, journaling, mood boarding and filling out a picture of what your practice looks like, how it works and where there might be blind spots.</p>

<p>The canvas I created is geared towards my own worldview, my own practice and so on - so please treat this as only one possible way to do this. There are as many indie styles as there are indies!</p>

<p>For my canvas I structured the canvas around 4 ‚Äúworlds‚Äù - and within each theme 3 provocations:</p>

<h2 id="inner-world">Inner World</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What stage is my indie consulting at?
    <ul>
      <li>Provocation: Who are your peers? Who do you look up to?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Who am I? How do I describe myself?
    <ul>
      <li>Provocation: How would you describe the work you <em>want</em> to do not just what you currently do?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What‚Äôs my growth story?
    <ul>
      <li>Provocation: How might you turn your personal growth story into a client-relevant narrative?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="outer-world">Outer World</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How strong is my network?
    <ul>
      <li>Provocation: Do people in my network have an accurate detailed picture of the kind of work I do / want?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How do clients know they can trust me?
    <ul>
      <li>Provocation: What is the most trusted brand or institution that you‚Äôre associated with? How can you make that more visible?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How do I show my thinking?
    <ul>
      <li>Provocation: How can you make your thinking more edgy? <a href="https://artofgig.substack.com/p/bootstrapping-with-beefs">Venkatesh‚Äôs theory of 20% beef</a> applies here.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="client-world">Client World</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What do clients look like?
    <ul>
      <li>Provocation: What common traits can you identify in your clients as humans? What are common traits of your point of contact not just the company?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What does my strategy work look like?
    <ul>
      <li>Provocation: What are the expanded contexts above/adjacent to my strategy work?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What does my stewardship work look like? (<a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/04/04/the-strategic-independent/">More info on strategy/stewardship here</a>)
    <ul>
      <li>Provocation: What parts of my strategy work are NOT part of my stewardship work? How might I learn how to do them or partner to provide expanded stewardship?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="money-world">Money World</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What is the financial situation?
    <ul>
      <li>Provocation: Where is the panic level? What is enough? How long can you go without work?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the avg size of a client? Avg year?
    <ul>
      <li>Provocation: How can you smooth the gaps between projects? Do you have any passive / recurring income?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the avg length of a client engagement?
    <ul>
      <li>Provocation: What triggers a client project ending? How can you reflect / identify these earlier?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-own-reflections">My own reflections</h2>

<p>I spent a few hours (yes it took me that long!) mulling these and sketching out some answers and you can get a feel for it here (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/f0wQtdL.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f0wQtdL.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Note - I think the right stance here is to use the text on the left as journaling and the grey areas on the right as a mood board. The aim is to create an open, exploratory sense of your practice - NOT to create a definite, polished ‚Äúone pager‚Äù for your business.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm still opening up and mulling some of the ideas but a few things I realized about my own practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google is such a core part of client‚Äôs perception of me and yet I never ever reference Google. How to expose this part of my identity more publicly? (without talking about the times I cried in the office lol)</li>
  <li>I do a lot of writing but almost none of it is tied to arcs and narratives clients care about! The handful of times I‚Äôve written about decentralized branding, content &amp; brand etc have driven client interest directly. I should do more of that.</li>
  <li>I have no beef in my public persona :(</li>
  <li>Executive sparring is a key piece of personal growth and definitely the <em>next</em> type of work I‚Äôm after</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="go-make-your-own">Go make your own!</h2>

<p>The figma file with my own template and a blank template is here:</p>

<p>Go make a copy and have fun!</p>

<p>I‚Äôd love your feedback on what is most/least valuable here? And I‚Äôd definitely encourage asking your own provocations - adapt this to your own practice!</p>

<p>Please share back on email, DMs, discord etc.</p>
