It's sometimes easy to forget there's a world outside of Git and GitHub, and it was interesting dipping a toe in!</p><h2 id="the-motivation-improving-net-standard-support" class="heading-with-anchor">The motivation: improving .NET Standard support<a href="#the-motivation-improving-net-standard-support"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>At <a href="https://www.elevatedirect.com/">Elevate Direct</a>, we use a <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sasa/">library called Sasa</a> quite extensively in our .NET projects. It contains a variety of utility types, but we use it primarily for the implementation of functional concepts like <code>Option&lt;&gt;</code>. The library has been around for a long time (since 2013), and at the start of 2019, <a href="https://higherlogics.blogspot.com/2019/01/sasa-v100-rc1.html">Sandro Magi added .NET Standard support</a>.</p><p>He did a great job <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support">supporting a wide range of platforms by targeting</a> .NET Standard 1.3. Unfortunately, if you're using a platform that supports <code>netstandard2.x</code>, then referencing a <code>netstandard1.x</code> package can result in a huge dependency tree being dumped in your folder output.</p><p>To work around this issue for consumers, library authors can add an <em>additional</em><code>netstandard2.x</code> target to their library. Unfortunately <em>that</em> can cause issues for people targeting <code>net461</code>. If you follow <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/cross-platform-targeting">the official advise on cross-platform targeting</a> to its conclusion, eventually you end up targeting at least four frameworks:</p><ul><li><code>netstandard1.x</code> for maximum compatibility</li><li><code>netstandard2.x</code> to avoid large dependency trees in .NET Core 2.x etc</li><li><code>net461</code> to avoid issues caused by <code>net461</code>'s "fake" .NET Standard 2.0 support</li><li><code>net472</code> to "override" the previous <code>net461</code> target, as .NET Framework 4.7.2 includes <em>real</em> .NET Standard 2.0 support.</li></ul><p>If you already have a library targeting <code>netstandard1.3</code>, then adding the extra targets is pretty easy: just change this line in your <em>.csproj</em> project file:</p><pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>TargetFramework</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>netstandard1.3<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>TargetFramework</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>to this (note the <code>s</code> in <code>TargetFrameworks</code>)</p><pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>TargetFrameworks</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>netstandard1.3;netstandard2.0;net461;net472<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>TargetFrameworks</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>Given all the hard work had been done to convert Sasa to use .NET Standard 1.3, I thought I'd help out by making the update, and sending a PR. I envisioned a 20 minutes piece of work, tops. </p><p>Then I realised the project was hosted on SourceForge, and uses Mercurial for version control.</p><h2 id="forking-a-project-on-sourceforge" class="heading-with-anchor">Forking a project on SourceForge<a href="#forking-a-project-on-sourceforge"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>I've pretty much gone my whole life barely using SourceForge. I'm sure I've downloaded a few things here and there, but I've certainly never hosted, contributed, or even really looked at any projects on there. </p><p>Unlike GitHub, where the code is front-and-center when you view a repository, it feels like you have to go hunting a bit further on SourceForge. The project landing page is much more focused on downloads and project activity (and Ads ðŸ¤®) but overall the process of submitting a patch should be quite familiar in principal if you're used to GitHub.</p><p>Start by clicking the <strong>Code</strong> tab in the project, which for the Sasa project takes you to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/sasa/code/">https://sourceforge.net/p/sasa/code/</a>. This is similar to the default GitHub view, and is where you can browse the code, view branches and commits, and fork the project.</p><p><img src="/content/images/2019/source_forge_0.png" alt="The code page for Sasa on SourceForge"></p><p>Just as with Git and GitHub, if you want to send a patch to a project on SourceForge, you first need to <em>fork</em> the code (i.e. create a "personal" copy of the project). After clicking <strong>Fork</strong> from the code page, you'll be taken to your fork of the project. After a few moments, the clone will be complete and you'll see a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/u/andrewlock/sasa/ci/default/tree/">copy of the code in your account</a>:</p><p><img src="/content/images/2019/source_forge_2.png" alt="The upstream copy after forking"></p><blockquote><p>I assume the <code>u/</code> prefix is to indicate that this is a clone of an existing project, but I'm not sure. It also mentions that the project is a clone of Sasa in the left sidebar.</p></blockquote><p>Once the project is forked, it's time to download the code and make the fix. Sasa uses <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial source code management</a> (rather than Git), so you need to install and use the <code>hg</code> tool. I've used SVN before, but never Mercurial so was interesting to give it a try.</p><blockquote><p>The nerd in me loves that their tool is <code>hg</code>, the chemical symbol for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element">mercury</a>). But I'm not sure about having a version control system who's name means "<a href="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/mercurial">subject to sudden or unpredictable changes of mood</a>"!</p></blockquote><h2 id="installing-mercurial" class="heading-with-anchor">Installing Mercurial<a href="#installing-mercurial"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>After a brief read of the <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/about">Mercurial about page</a>, it actually looks pretty interesting. It sounds very much like Git in a lot of ways, and was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial#History">started about the same time</a>. It's a distributed version control system, and branching and merging are cheap, just like Git. It does have some <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-mercurial/">interesting extra features</a>, but frankly it seems like Git has already won, so I probably won't be looking into any more than the basics ðŸ˜‰</p><p>You can <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/downloads">download Mercurial from their website</a>. As it's mostly written in Python, cross-platform installers are available for loads of different operating systems (compare that to Git, where Windows definitely used to feel second-class!) Version 4.9.1 was the latest at the time I downloaded the <em>Inno Setup installer - x64 Windows</em>, though I see <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/release/windows/Mercurial-5.0-x64.exe">version 5.0 is out now</a>.</p><p>Once downloaded and installed, you can test everything is working correctly by typing <code>hg</code> at the command line:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span><span class="token function">hg</span>

Just as with Git, you need to setup your username locally. create a new file at <em>%USERPROFILE%/mercurial.ini</em> with the format shown below and add your username and email:</p><pre class="language-ini"><code class="language-ini"><span class="token selector">[ui]</span><span class="token constant">username</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span> Andrew Lock &lt;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b6d3ced7dbc6dad3f6d3ced7dbc6dad398d5d9db">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;</span></code></pre><p>At this point, Mercurial is installed and ready to go, but we don't have any code on our machine yet. </p><h2 id="cloning-the-repository-and-committing-a-change" class="heading-with-anchor">Cloning the repository and committing a change<a href="#cloning-the-repository-and-committing-a-change"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>Cloning the repository creates a copy of it on your local machine, including all the branches and history, just like with Git. The code page in SourceForge shows the command you need to run. In my case, it was </p><pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell">hg clone ssh:<span class="token operator">/</span><span class="token operator">/</span><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5c3d32382e392b30333f371c343b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a><span class="token punctuation">.</span>code<span class="token punctuation">.</span>sf<span class="token punctuation">.</span>net<span class="token operator">/</span>u<span class="token operator">/</span>andrewlock<span class="token operator">/</span>sasa u<span class="token operator">-</span>andrewlock<span class="token operator">-</span>sasa
</code></pre><p>This command clones the repository into a folder called <em>u-andrewlock-sasa</em>. You'll need to confirm the authenticity of the SourceForge host, and enter your password:</p><pre class="language-powershell"><code class="language-powershell">&gt; hg clone ssh:<span class="token operator">/</span><span class="token operator">/</span><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4f2e212b3d2a3823202c240f2728">[email&nbsp;protected]</a><span class="token punctuation">.</span>code<span class="token punctuation">.</span>sf<span class="token punctuation">.</span>net<span class="token operator">/</span>u<span class="token operator">/</span>andrewlock<span class="token operator">/</span>sasa u<span class="token operator">-</span>andrewlock<span class="token operator">-</span>sasa

This takes you to the Request merge page, where you can enter a title, chose the source and destination branches, and enter a description. This should be very familiar if you're used to GitHub, though the description text isn't markdown unfortunately. </p><p><img src="/content/images/2019/source_forge_4.png" alt="Creating a merge request"></p><p>After creating <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/sasa/code/merge-requests/1/">the merge request</a>, the owner of the repository will hopefully receive a notification, and they can review (and hopefully merge) your code! You can track the merge request in the original project's repository (i.e. in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/sasa/code/merge-requests/1/">Sasa's repository in my case</a>). </p><p>It took a while (thanks to a lack of notification from SourceForge it seems), but my contribution was merged! Success ðŸ™‚ </p><p>Trying out both SourceForge and Mercurial for the first time was interesting. Mercurial was super easy to use, and looks like it would generally be easier to get into than Git for newcomers. And I didn't even get to the really interesting parts, like preserving history on file moves or the built in web-server(!). Unfortunately, while Mercurial is in use at some very notable places (e.g. <a href="https://code.fb.com/core-data/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/">Facebook</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial#Open_source_projects_using_Mercurial">notable projects</a>, it feels like Git has probably won the hearts-and-minds. </p><p>And I think part of that has to be thanks to GitHub. It's become somewhat of the de-facto location for open source projects. And after using SourceForge, albeit briefly, I'm not surprised. SourceForge feels like a website from 10 years ago. It's not especially welcoming to newcomers, and was hard to get my head around. I'm just glad the fact the fork/merge request paradigm mirror's GitHub's terminology. If it didn't, I doubt I would have ever figured it out before I got frustrated and gave up.</p><p>Still, it was worth it in the end. If you haven't already, check out the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sasa/1.0.0-RC3">Sasa library on NuGet</a>, it has a whole variety of <a href="https://higherlogics.com/dev/sasa/api/index.html">useful utility implementations</a>.</p><h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor">Summary<a href="#summary"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>In this post I described the process I went through of submitting a change to a project hosted on SourceForge, using the Mercurial source control system. I described the process of forking a repository, installing Mercurial, cloning a repository, and pushing your changes. Finally, I described how to create a merge request. </p></div></div></div></div>
