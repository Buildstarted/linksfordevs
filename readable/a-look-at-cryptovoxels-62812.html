<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The term<span></span> <span>“</span>Metaverse” was orig­i­nally coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neal Stephenson</a> in his 1992 novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snow Crash</a>. In the Metaverse hu­mans, as avatars, in­ter­act with each other and soft­ware agents, in a three-di­men­sional space that uses the metaphor of the real world.

It uses the Ethereum blockchain to track own­er­ship of goods in its econ­omy, most im­por­tantly prop­erty. It has come a long way since the orig­i­nal trailer (above) was re­leased.</p><blockquote><p>Cryptovoxels is a vir­tual world pow­ered by the Ethereum blockchain. Players can buy land and build stores and art gal­leries. Editing tools, avatars, text chat and voice chat are built in. — cryp­tovox­els.com</p></blockquote><p>There are other sim­i­lar pro­jects on Ethereum, such as <a href="https://www.decentraland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decentraland</a> and <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sandbox</a>, but this post will fo­cus on Cryptovoxels.</p><h2 id="why-ethereum%3F">Why Ethereum? <a href="#why-ethereum%3F"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p>From an im­ple­men­ta­tion stand­point, there is no rea­son you <em>tech­ni­cally</em> need a blockchain to build a Metaverse. In fact, build­ing Cryptovoxels on Ethereum likely came with its unique set of chal­lenges.</p><p><em>However</em>, build­ing on Ethereum also comes with some unique ad­van­tages. For one, it just ﬁts the <em>ethos</em>. In Ready Player One the <span>OASIS</span> be­comes so im­por­tant that the com­pany run­ning it be­comes one of the most valu­able in the world. In fact, the <span>OASIS</span> is so valu­able that the cen­tral con­ﬂict of the movie is about who owns and con­trols it.</p><p>Having Cryptovoxel par­cel own­er­ship be tracked on Ethereum pro­vides users with strong guar­an­tees that their as­sets can­not sim­ply be taken away by the cre­ators. While it is true that the en­tire game is­n’t de­cen­tral­ized, and that the cre­ators could change the game to <em>ig­nore</em> what Ethereum says, the fact that it is built on Ethereum shows a com­mit­ment to let­ting the users own the world.</p><p>This com­mit­ment has al­lowed Cryptovoxels to at­tract the right kind of early adopters, who have taken own­er­ship of the world in their own right. More specif­i­cally, it has at­tracted de­sign­ers, painters, mod­el­ing ex­perts, ar­chi­tects, dig­i­tal artists, etc…. These artists have done an amaz­ing job in build­ing out the world and <a href="https://fragosti.com/posts/a-look-at-cryptovoxels/#what-can-you-do%3F">mak­ing it a place worth ex­plor­ing and hang­ing out in</a>.</p><p>Finally, there is at least one more tan­gi­ble ad­van­tage to build­ing a Metaverse on Ethereum: ex­ist­ing as­sets and in­fra­struc­ture. The Cryptovoxel world is highly com­pat­i­ble with the rest of the Ethereum ecosys­tem, es­pe­cially the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ERC-721</a> stan­dard (also known as Non-Fungible Tokens).</p><p>Many users al­ready own NFTs (such as <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CryptoKitties</a>), and will see Cryptovoxels as a per­fect place to dis­play and sell them. Cryptovoxel parcels are also NFTs, and so are com­pat­i­ble with <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/cryptovoxels?sortBy=assets_prod_main_price_asc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ex­ist­ing ex­change in­fra­struc­ture</a>, which means the cre­ators of Cryptovoxels never had to build an ex­change to let their users trade parcels.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-do%3F">What can you do? <a href="#what-can-you-do%3F"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p>While Cryptovoxels feels like a game, it is just an open world.

Every time I ex­plore, I ﬁnd some­thing new and sur­pris­ing.</p><p>You can see that <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the map</a> dis­plays a few is­lands and neigh­bor­hoods, such as<span></span> <span>“</span>Proxima” or<span></span> <span>“</span>Moon”. At the time of writ­ing, there are 31 neigh­bor­hoods and 4 is­lands, al­though <a href="https://fragosti.com/posts/a-look-at-cryptovoxels/posts/a-look-at-cryptovoxels/#how-to-get-a-parcel">more are com­ing on­line every week</a>.</p><p><img src="https://fragosti.com/assets/img/cv-area-51.jpg" alt="Area 51" loading="lazy" data-src="/assets/img/cv-area-51.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <img src="https://fragosti.com/assets/img/cv-kitties.jpg" alt="CryptoKitties" loading="lazy" data-src="/assets/img/cv-kitties.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <img src="https://fragosti.com/assets/img/cv-frankfurt.jpg" alt="Frankfurt" loading="lazy" data-src="/assets/img/cv-frankfurt.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p><p>Each neigh­bor­hood has its unique look-and-feel. In <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/neighborhoods/area-51" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Area 51</a>, you’ll see a lot of alien themed con­tent, and in <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/neighborhoods/kitties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kitties</a>, you’ll see a lot of ref­er­ences to and col­lectibles from the CryptoKitties game. Neighborhood build­ing re­stric­tions come into play as well, as some neigh­bor­hoods such as <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/neighborhoods/frankfurt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frankfurt</a> al­low for taller build­ings and there­fore have a big city vibe.</p><p>Of course, neigh­bor­hoods are just com­posed of in­di­vid­ual parcels with unique own­ers and unique builds — some more im­pres­sive than oth­ers. Take the <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/1418" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>DAI</span> House</a> for ex­am­ple, which is a trib­ute to the <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>DAI</span> cryp­tocur­rency</a> and boasts foun­tains and spin­ning <span>3D</span> <span>DAI</span> mod­els. Another ex­am­ple is the <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/2908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Token Smart Amphitheatre</a>, which dis­plays some im­pres­sive ar­chi­tec­ture and even a cafe, or <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/2792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sugar Club</a> where peo­ple go to lis­ten to mu­sic and dance (yes, there is a dance but­ton).</p><p><img src="https://fragosti.com/assets/img/cv-dai-house.jpg" alt="DAI House" loading="lazy" data-src="/assets/img/cv-dai-house.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <img src="https://fragosti.com/assets/img/cv-amphitheatre.jpg" alt="Amphitheatre" loading="lazy" data-src="/assets/img/cv-amphitheatre.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <img src="https://fragosti.com/assets/img/cv-sugar-club.jpg" alt="Sugar Club" loading="lazy" data-src="/assets/img/cv-sugar-club.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p><p>There are also quite a few per­son­al­i­ties and mag­nates in Cryptovoxels, who are re­spon­si­ble for build­ing and ad­ver­tis­ing some of the biggest builds and events. Artist, ar­chi­tect and<span></span> <span>“</span>Photoshop Priest” <a href="https://twitter.com/money_alotta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alotta Money</a> re­cently ad­ver­tised the open­ing party for the <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/2377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Voxel Hotel</a>, which has to be the most im­pres­sive build I’ve seen in Cryptovoxels so far.</p><p>In fact, as re­cently as yes­ter­day, peo­ple have been gath­er­ing at the Voxel Hotel and else­where for le­git­i­mate meet-ups and events. Many of these meet-ups are <a href="https://www.vraf.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well or­ga­nized</a> and have con­sid­er­able thought put into them.</p><p>There are plenty of se­crets to dis­cover as well, as some of the best builds and ex­pe­ri­ences are hid­den away. If you check out <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/2902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EtherBrews</a> it ap­pears to be a sim­ple brew­ery on the wa­ter, but if you go in­side and ﬂy over the wall, you’ll ﬁnd a beau­ti­ful tree. Some builds are straight up puz­zles, like <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/1861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yours Truly Puzzle</a> (can you get in?). Finally, you may even ﬁnd <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=S@289W,3U,476N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">games like Breakout</a> ap­pear on ran­dom cor­ners of the world since bet­ter script­ing func­tion­al­ity has been added.</p><p><img src="https://fragosti.com/assets/img/cv-tree.jpg" alt="EtherBrews" loading="lazy" data-src="/assets/img/cv-tree.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <img src="https://fragosti.com/assets/img/cv-puzzle.jpg" alt="Yours Truly Puzzle" loading="lazy" data-src="/assets/img/cv-puzzle.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <img src="https://fragosti.com/assets/img/cv-breakout.jpg" alt="Breakout" loading="lazy" data-src="/assets/img/cv-breakout.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p><p>The above only scratches the sur­face of what you can ex­plore in Cryptovoxels.

People are go­ing nuts over these vir­tual prod­ucts that are en­tirely gen­er­ated by the com­mu­nity.</p><p><img src="https://fragosti.com/assets/img/cv-hats.jpg" alt="Cryptovoxels Hat" loading="lazy" data-src="/assets/img/cv-hats.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <img src="https://fragosti.com/assets/img/cv-car.jpg" alt="Cryptovoxels Car" loading="lazy" data-src="/assets/img/cv-car.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <img src="https://fragosti.com/assets/img/cv-watches.jpg" alt="Cryptovoxels Watch" loading="lazy" data-src="/assets/img/cv-watches.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p><p>This is what it looks like when your avatar is com­pletely decked out.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-a-parcel">How to get a par­cel <a href="#how-to-get-a-parcel"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p>If the prices you see for parcels on OpenSea are a bit out of your price range, you should know that new parcels are minted every Tuesday at ap­prox­i­mately 5pm <span>PST</span>. To get in on the ac­tion the best ﬁrst step is to join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bv68xT4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cryptovoxels Discord</a>, where the <code>#general</code> and <code>#new-island</code> chan­nels will be the most rel­e­vant.</p><p>Every Tuesday the Cryptovoxels team re­leases new is­lands around Origin City. The process is likely to change in the fu­ture, but the way it works for now is that the team will bulk sell 20-30 new prop­er­ties at prices from 1 <span>ETH</span> and above (perhaps lower, de­pend­ing on the is­land).</p><p>To see the parcels be­fore they go on sale, you can check OpenSea for <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/cryptovoxels?sortBy=assets_prod_main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span><span>“</span>Recently Born” parcels</a>, se­lect the par­cel that you’re in­ter­ested in, and press<span></span> <span>“</span>View on Cryptovoxels” to visit the par­cel it­self. Once the sale goes live, you’ll likely want to <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/cryptovoxels?sortBy=assets_prod_main&amp;refinementList%5B_tags%5D%5B0%5D=The%20Bronx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ﬁl­ter for that spe­ciﬁc is­land, and sort by price</a>.</p><p>If you are tech­ni­cally savvy, I’ve writ­ten a <em>very</em> sim­ple <a href="https://github.com/fragosti/sea-sniper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">script</a> that will par­tic­i­pate in the sales for you. However, un­less you un­der­stand the code, I rec­om­mend tak­ing the OpenSea ap­proach. In my ex­pe­ri­ence, it has been very easy to get a par­cel this way.</p><p>When you suc­ceed feel free to come say hi at <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/1994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my par­cel</a>!</p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts <a href="#final-thoughts"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p>It’s not too late to join the party. The com­mu­nity is very wel­com­ing and the Cryptovoxels team seems to be al­ways im­ple­ment­ing fea­ture re­quests from peo­ple in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bv68xT4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> chan­nel. It’s a lot of fun to see it evolve, and I’m sure it will be a lot dif­fer­ent just a cou­ple of months from now.</p><p>As men­tioned above, new parcels are be­ing added all the time.
