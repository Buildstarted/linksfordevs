And why’s it so exciting? with Chris Sainty<br>- 🍻 Virtual Bar</p><p>👉 What is Blazor? And why’s it so exciting?</p><p>What started as a prototype in 2017 has become one of the hottest technologies in the .NET ecosystem. Blazor is Microsoft’s new front-end framework for building single page applications using C#, not JavaScript. That’s right, C# running in your browser. No plugins, transpilation or voodoo magic involved - just web standards.</p><p>In this talk, you'll learn all about this game changing platform and how it brings choice back into front-end development.</p><p>Starting from the beginning, you'll explore Blazor's flexible architecture and it's different rendering modes. You'll learn how C# code is able to run in the browser via a technology called WebAssembly. You'll also cover Blazor's component model, syntax, project types and more.</p><p>By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of what Blazor is and how it could be the last framework you'll ever need!</p><p>👨‍🏫 About the speaker:<br>Chris Sainty is a Microsoft MVP, software engineer and blogger with over 15 years experience working with ASP.NET. He currently works at Flagship Group, a housing association in the east of England, leading a team building repairs and maintenance solutions using .NET Core technologies.</p><p>Chris is passionate about sharing his knowledge with the community. He is an avid blogger and speaker. He maintains several open source projects under the Blazored banner and regularly contributes to open source projects. Chris is also a proud member of the .NET Foundation.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/@chris_sainty" title="https://twitter.com/@chris_sainty" target="__blank">https://twitter.com/@chris_sainty</a><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-sainty/" title="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-sainty/" target="__blank">https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-sainty/</a><br><a href="https://chrissainty.com/" title="https://chrissainty.com/" target="__blank">https://chrissainty.com/</a></p><p>🍻 The Virtual Bar<br>Due to the current environmental situation after the online event, we'll be heading off to the "virtual bar".
