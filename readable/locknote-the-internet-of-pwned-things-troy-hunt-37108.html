            If it connects, it can be pwned! As much as we may love IoT, it introduces all new vulnerabilities in places we've never before seen them. We're collecting classes of data that have never been digitised before, storing it on the cloud and opening up control of devices to potentially anyone with an internet connection.

This talk delves into real world examples of how IoT fails us. It looks at what the vulnerabilities are, how they were exploited, the impact they're having and importantly, how we need to evolve as an industry to prevent future incidents. It's an often frightening and sometimes hilarious look at just how pwned the internet of things is becoming.
