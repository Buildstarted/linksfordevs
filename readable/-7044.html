They make up less than 0.5% of the Icelandic flock, and are distinguished by distinctive physical and behavioral traits that are genetically based.&nbsp; There is evidence that they arrived in Iceland with the original settlers as they are mentioned in some of the earliest records, and over the centuries were selected for their intelligence and their ability to lead the flock, sense danger, etc., rather than for meat (brains not brawn!).&nbsp; While no longer used as extensively on the farms as in the past, the sheep continue to lead the flocks, especially at the fall gathering. The numbers of leadersheep in Iceland have remained fairly constant for several decades, with approximately 1400 purebred leadersheep and approximately 500 "hybrids" - those sheep with between 50% and 99% leader genetics.&nbsp; In appearance, leader sheep will be taller and thinner than the “typical” Icelandic sheep, and are generally solid colored with white socks and a blaze, although the badgerface pattern was formerly quite common. Leadersheep are highly intelligent: individual leader rams held by the Southram Breeding Center in Iceland are described as “calm and sensible,” “alert,” “gentle and eager to please people,” “eager to learn.”</p><p>As with any genetically-based characters, the physical and behavioral traits of leadersheep are easily lost through cross-breeding. In Iceland, retaining leadersheep below 50% is discouraged as these lower percentage sheep do not show the range of leader behaviors, and do not improve the conformation of the commercial "typical" sheep.&nbsp;In North America, the only imported leadersheep was a leader daughter (Yeoman Blessa); she is described as showing noticeable traits of flock protection.&nbsp; However, with usual breeding, the leader genetics and traits she displayed were soon be diluted. &nbsp;The availability of pure leadersheep semen from Iceland for artificial insemination (AI) has made it possible to up-breed leadersheep in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>At Trinity Farm, we are dedicated to conserving leadersheep genetics.&nbsp; To date, we have introduced seven leader lines (Florgodi, Geri, Golsi, Joakim, Karl Philip, Loftur, and Ungi) new to North America, thus increasing the genetic diversity of North American leadersheep.&nbsp; We have also attained high percentage leaders (to date, to 97% leader), the highest outside Iceland, and we have supplied these leader genetics to other farms committed to preserving these rare animals.&nbsp; We are very proud of this achievement, and anticipate further progress in our project of conserving the genetics of these unique animals.</p><p>Below are illustrated the AI leader sires represented in the leader genetics of Trinity Farm sheep, the "foundation" leader ewes and genetic lines they possess, and a selection of the leader lambs born at Trinity Farm.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1515213974005_89656"><div><p><strong>UNGI 13-938</strong></p><p>Related to Leifur 02-900 (double great grandsire) and more distantly to Joakim 08-863</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_7_1458421735090_13275"><p><h2><strong>FOUNDATION LEADER LINE EWES</strong></h2></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_7_1458421735090_15731"><p><h2><strong>A SELECTION OF THE</strong></h2><h2><strong>LEADERSHEEP </strong></h2><h2><strong>BORN AT TRINITY FARM</strong></h2></p></div></div></div>
