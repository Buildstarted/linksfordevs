                            Now that we can summarize light transport at every interface, we need to be able to express the transport for specific groups of light paths. <strong>*click*</strong><p>Lets take the following example of a group of light paths refractive two times before being reflected by the bottom interface and leaving the layered structure after two more refractions. <strong>*click*</strong></p><p>In our framework, we use the central path to estimate the statistics. <strong>*click*</strong> This central path is constructed by converting all interfaces as smooth ones. Thus it correspond to a purely specular path. <strong>*click*</strong></p><p>We start at the first vertex of this path and set the statistics to match a dirac in the incident direction. <strong>*click*</strong></p><p>Then, we apply the first operator which in this case is a refraction. <strong>*click*</strong> This will specify the statistics of the outgoing radiance. <strong>*click*</strong> We convert those statistics into incident statistics by mirroring the statistics. and proceed with the next interface. <strong>*click*</strong>

                            We continue this process for the remaining vertices of the path until the outgoing direction is reached. <strong>*click until end*</strong> Note that this example is here to give the intuition of how operators chain together, there exist an infinite number of specular paths and in practice we can not explicitly evaluate them all. Instead, we rely on three mechanisms for efficient evaluation: merging of statistics, analytic form for multiple scattering, and adding-doubling.
