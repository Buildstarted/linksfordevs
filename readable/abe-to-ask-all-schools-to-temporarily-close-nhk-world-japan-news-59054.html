                <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he will ask all elementary and high schools across the country to temporarily close beginning Monday.</p>
                <p>The development comes after a man in his 80s who was infected with the new coronavirus died in the northern prefecture of Hokkaido. Fifteen new cases of infection were reported there on Thursday.</p>
                <p>Hokkaido's governor said the man who died had pre-existing conditions.</p>
                <p>Naomichi Suzuki said, " The patient was more susceptible to respiratory problems compared to healthy people."</p>
                <p>Officials say 2 of the 15 new cases are children under 10 years of age.</p>
                <p>The latest cases bring the number of confirmed infections in Hokkaido to 54, the most in Japan.</p>
                <p>All elementary and junior high schools in the prefecture will be closed for about a week.</p>
                <p>Infected people there include students, a teacher, and a school-bus driver.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile health officials in the western prefecture of Osaka revealed a woman in her 40s has tested positive for the coronavirus for a second time.</p>
                <p>The patient is a tour guide. She led a bus with visitors from Wuhan, China ... the city at the center of the outbreak ... last month. She was later diagnosed and hospitalized.<br>
The woman was discharged after testing negative in early February. But she felt pains in her throat and chest and came back positive on Wednesday.</p>
                <p>The latest developments came as crew members aboard the quarantined ship docked near Tokyo began disembarking Thursday.</p>
                <p>Those without symptoms will be quarantined and undergo medical checkups for 14 days.</p>
                <p>It will take about 3 days for the approximately 240 crew members of the Diamond Princess to disembark.</p>
                <p>Across Japan, more than 900 cases of infection have been confirmed. More than 700 of those are from the cruise ship. Eight people have died.</p>
                <p>The outbreak has prompted the Japanese government to call for major events to be canceled, delayed or scaled back over the next two weeks.</p>
