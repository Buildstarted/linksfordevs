29 December 2017
</p>
<p>While discussing <a href="https://danluu.com/keyboard-latency/">Dan Luuâ€™s keyboard latency experiments</a> I realized that I had never tested my keyboardâ€™s latency. I use <a href="https://thume.ca/2014/09/08/creating-a-keyboard-1-hardware/">a custom keyboard I designed and built</a>, but when I wrote the firmware I was focused on getting it working and didnâ€™t pay any attention to latency. When I took a look at the source code and immediately saw a 10ms delay that was there for no other reason than paranoia, I knew I was in for some fun.</p>
<p>After a bunch of measuring, finding and squashing sources of latency, I managed to improve the latency of the main loop from 30 <em>milliseconds</em> to 700 <em>microseconds</em>. I then added a feature that changed the colour of the keyboardâ€™s RGB LEDs on every key press so that I could use the <a href="http://isitsnappy.com/">Is It Snappy</a> app with my iPhoneâ€™s high speed camera mode to do some latency testing.</p>
<p>The first thing I found was that with my improved firmware the end to end latency of typing a character in Sublime Text and XCode 9 near the top of my Macbook display is around 42ms<sup id="fnref:fps"><a href="#fn:fps">1</a></sup>. This is pretty good, but the astonishing thing is that it means that before I fixed the firmware <strong>my keyboard used to account for almost <em>half</em> of my end-to-end typing latency</strong>. This is measuring from the LED colour change so it doesnâ€™t count the around 15ms<sup id="fnref:fps:1"><a href="#fn:fps">1</a></sup> according to my testing from starting to press one of my keys the switch activating.</p>

<p>I also tested my Macbook keyboard, as well as a few older low speed USB Apple keyboards, and found that they had around 67ms<sup id="fnref:fps:2"><a href="#fn:fps">1</a></sup> of end-to-end latency, measuring from when the switch was fully depressed while hitting the key as fast as I could. I suspect part of the reason for this is that these keyboards only poll at 8ms and 10ms intervals according to USB Prober (an old Apple dev tool), whereas the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html">Teensy</a> in my custom keyboard polls every millisecond. According to Danâ€™s post newer Apple external keyboards also poll at 1000hz.</p>
<p>Note that the 700us main loop doesnâ€™t translate into 700us switch-to-USB latency, since the USB transfer is done asynchronously via DMA by the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html">Teensy</a>â€™s USB controller when it is polled, which happens at 1000hz.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s interesting that I used my keyboard for 3 years without noticing that it added 30ms of latency. I have a few guesses why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although I can perceive 30ms of latency in a comparison test, I have to pay attention, my keyboard having 30ms of extra latency just made it feel different, but thatâ€™s unsurprising since it was different in a bunch of ways.</li>
<li>My only comparison was other high-latency keyboards, like my Macbookâ€™s. 30ms of latency difference is more perceptiple than 5-10ms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyhow hereâ€™s how I managed to bring the latency down from 30ms to 700us:</p>
<ol>
<li>I added some measurement code that printed the time spent in the main loop to the Serial console after every key press. This gave me the 30ms figure.</li>
<li>I removed the 10ms delay in the main loop, and everything still worked.</li>
<li>I searched for other delays and found one 2ms one between enabling a row for scanning and reading it, which I removed with no apparent consequences. I added back in a 2 microsecond delay just in case.</li>
<li>I had tried to make the display on my keyboard only update when it changed, but I messed this up somewhere else and it was taking 5ms to update on every key press.</li>
<li>The right half of my keyboard is scanned using an I/O expander over i2c since I didnâ€™t have enough pins on the Teensy. This is the same way the two halves of the <a href="https://www.ergodox.io/">Ergodox</a> work. Based on some Ergodox firmware I saw, I reinitialized the direction registers of the I/O expander before every scan, just in case. Unfortunately this added 2ms and wasnâ€™t really necessary since unlike the Ergodox you canâ€™t disconnect the second half of my keyboard with a cable.</li>
<li>Now my loop was taking 3.8ms which was almost entirely the i2c communication with the I/O expander. A friend recommended I check out <a href="https://github.com/nox771/i2c_t3">nox771â€™s fast i2c library</a>. Unfortunately, it wouldnâ€™t compile on the super old version of the Arduino/Teensyduino software I was using. I decided to upgrade, and after several hours in C++ compilation hell and accounting for a few changes, it worked. I bumped the i2c frequency up to 1.8 megahertz and now my loops took 700us!</li>
<li>Now I started running into bouncing problems that lead to the occasionally doubled letter, so I needed to implement debouncing. Some ways of implementing debouncing add latency but thatâ€™s totally unnecessary. <a href="https://github.com/trishume/PolyType/commit/372c2056d705211fb5554a6975eeca34b59f0bc8">I implemented</a> a simple technique that sends transitions immediately and then doesnâ€™t update a key for 5ms after.</li>
</ol>
<p>The specifics are only relevant to other people building keyboard firmware, especially the fast i2c one which I donâ€™t think most ErgoDox firmwares use. But I think itâ€™s interesting to see how easy it was to improve the latency of software that wasnâ€™t designed for it with only a few hours work.</p>
