<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p>You can probably tell at a glance that a “Chanel” handbag going for $20 at a flea market is fake. But you might not give a second thought to items that arrive on your doorstep via Amazon Prime. With <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/blog/amazon-counterfeit-fake-products/">the rise of third-party sellers</a> on Amazon, maybe you should.</p><p>Although Amazon <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/blog/amazon-counterfeit-fake-products/#amazon-fights-back">has taken many measures to prevent counterfeits and unsafe products</a> from showing up on its site, plenty of fakes still slip through. Over the past several months, we’ve purchased counterfeits and knockoffs making fraudulent safety claims and encountered a few instances in which a seller switched in an authentic product but from a discontinued or lesser-quality line—all delivered through Amazon Prime. We also obtained authentic items, either directly from the manufacturer or with confirmation from the brand. While the fakes and knockoffs may look like the real products at first glance, they’re often lower in quality, sometimes hiding potential health or safety issues.</p><p>Many people think that counterfeits and knockoffs are so obviously inferior—visually and otherwise—that it’s easy to spot the difference between a fake and the real thing. But increasingly, that’s not the case with counterfeits purchased online. Test yourself: Can you spot the real thing in the photos below?</p><h3>1.

It was an early recommendation on Wirecutter and is made by Joseph Enterprises, a small company based in San Francisco that also produces the <a href="https://chia.com/joseph-enterprises-inc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as-seen-on-TV Clapper and Chia Pet</a>.</p><p>The counterfeit glove, which we purchased from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ove-Glove-Resistant-Resistance-Household/dp/B000VS63DE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this Amazon page</a> from a third-party seller, looked almost identical to the real thing, with near-perfect packaging. The major differences:</p><ul><li>The real glove’s blue lines were cleaner, and there was a tag inside with material information as well as a loop for hanging. The fake glove arrived with a snag in the weave.</li><li>The heat protection was slightly better on the real glove, which was thicker and had a longer wrist. The fake glove’s painted-on lines gave off a melted-plastic smell when we used it to hold a heated cast-iron pan for 10 seconds.</li><li>The real glove cost us $5 more than the fake glove, a 50 percent difference.</li></ul><p>Although knockoffs are also present on separate Amazon listings, counterfeit ‘Ove’ Gloves often pop up on the product page for the real ‘Ove’ Glove, according to Michael Hirsch, vice president of Joseph Enterprises. To combat them, the company buys the fakes and then informs Amazon of the copyright infringement. Getting the fake gloves removed from Amazon can be a long process, Hirsch said, taking weeks or even months of playing whack-a-mole with counterfeit sellers: “Once they’re off, they come back under a different brand and name.”</p><p>It’s easy to see why the fakes persist. We found counterfeit ‘Ove’ Gloves for sale for about <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Heat-Resistant-Hot-Surface-Handler-Oven_62058031913.html?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.normalList.239.3eacf8faNT5GRT" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2 a piece in bulk on Alibaba</a>, the photograph clearly showing a knockoff version with black stitching instead of white around the wrist.</p><p>The authentic ‘Ove’ Glove is available for purchase through a page indicating that it is sold and shipped by Amazon.com or sold by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;asin=B0797DTFLM&amp;isAmazonFulfilled=1&amp;isCBA=&amp;marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;orderID=&amp;seller=A1V9XSPT1QBWV1&amp;tab=&amp;vasStoreID=" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joseph Ent</a>, the Amazon storefront for Joseph Enterprises.</p><p>The seller was blocked not long after I purchased the glove, and their storefront no longer exists.</p><h3>2.

The materials on the YXTDZ felt flimsier.</li><li>The Mifold’s lap-belt guide locked into place in three positions, while the YXTDZ’s did not lock in place at all.</li><li>The Mifold had a label with instructions and safety and manufacture information stitched onto the seat (as required by federal regulation), while the YXTDZ did not.</li><li>We purchased the YXTDZ seat via a third-party seller with fulfillment by Amazon Prime for nearly $24. The Mifold was about $33, sold and shipped by Amazon.</li></ul><p>Although the YXTDZ booster is not trying to pass itself off as a Mifold by name, it’s clearly a knockoff of the Mifold’s unique design. And it’s not the only one: Mifold CEO Jon Sumroy told us that he began to see copycats almost as soon as the company launched. “They don’t copy exactly the design, but what they have done is copy the concept of the product.” (Sumroy compares his invention against cheap knockoffs in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWeLhWxQbMo&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this video</a>.) The physical differences are clear, but it’s those invisible differences—including the fact that whereas the Mifold is compliant with federal safety requirements for child-restraint systems, the knockoff does not appear to be—that are far more worrisome.</p><p>The listing no longer exists.</p><h3>4.

The patented and trademarked harness is made by AmSafe, an aviation-products manufacturer that makes restraint systems for 600 airlines, <a href="https://www.amsafe.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the company’s website</a>.

The Amazon-purchased harness had thin, plastic buckles—including, inexplicably, latches to release the shoulder straps. The cheaper harness’s adjustable shoulder straps did not lock in place.</li><li>Whereas the CARES device had safety installation and manufacture information printed directly on the belt, the bought-on-Amazon harness arrived with a paper printout only.</li></ul><p>Charley Fussner, a business unit manager at AmSafe, told us that the company has suffered “significant losses - hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales” due to knockoff harnesses that look like the Kids Fly Safe harness but lack the FAA stamp of approval.

The cost to own one can add up over time because the heads can be expensive—around $8 each, which amounts to $32 a year if you replace them at the recommended three-month interval. Still, <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/blog/electric-toothbrush-brush-heads/">we recommend using the brand-name heads</a> over cheap generics for better feel and the confidence of using American Dental Association–approved accessories.</p><p>It took me some digging to reach the conclusion that a malfunctioning head I bought for my own use in 2019 wasn’t actually a fake but was likely discontinued stock with a slightly different design and harder bristles than the newer design had. I found minor but noticeable differences between Sonicare Sensitive toothbrush heads purchased from a third-party seller through Amazon Prime and those purchased through the Philips website:</p><ul><li>I purchased Sonicare Sensitive toothbrush heads from <a href="https://wrctr.co/37KodB6" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Philips.com</a> for almost $27 for a pack of three.

One of the heads I received from Amazon did not fit well on the toothbrush handle, falling off with a little shaking.</li><li>The logo on the neck of the Philips-purchased head was raised and textured, and the metal ring on the bottom of the head appeared to be slightly wider and more matte. The logo on the Amazon-purchased head looked more narrow and was not raised or textured.</li><li>The packaging on the Philips-purchased toothbrushes matched current fonts and logos used on Sonicare packaging, with a copyright date on the box of 2017. The label on the Amazon-bought brushes had a copyright date of 2012, and the printing was grainier.</li></ul><figure id="attachment_139807"><figure><img alt="A person holds a Philips Sonicare toothbrush with a fake brush head that falls off." data-src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/amazon-fakes-toothbrush.gif" width="570" height="380"></figure><figcaption> The toothbrush head we purchased from Amazon fell off the toothbrush with a little shaking. <span>Video: Rozette Rago</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/blog/what-to-do-amazon-purchase-fake/">Amazon seller returned my money</a> after I asked whether the toothbrush heads were authentic.
