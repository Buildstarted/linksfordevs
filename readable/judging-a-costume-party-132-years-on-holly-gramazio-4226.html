They’re pictures from a children’s costume party from 1887, and they are <em>extremely fascinating</em>. (Due warning, if you go through the whole photoset a few of them are also <em>pretty racist.</em>)</p><p id="2c8e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now, obviously the appropriate thing to do with a set of 132-year-old photos of a children’s costume party is to go through and award prizes.</p><p id="ed7e" data-selectable-paragraph="">There are a <em>lot </em>of different costumes. There are six-year-olds dressed as fairies and flowers and cricketers. There are teenagers who you might imagine would be too grown up, but who nonetheless are taking it all very seriously, like “Lizzie Stevenson aged 17 years old, dressed as a Hornet”, and “Darcy Aird aged 16 years old, dressed as a Jester”. Lizzie is unfortunately 149 years old now and also dead, so is unable to respond to requests to be my new best friend.</p></div></div><div><div><p id="ca5e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Most of the boys are dressed up as sailors, Neapolitan fishermen, or Etonians. It’s not clear to me why a load of schoolboys in Australia decided that the best thing to dress up as was “a different, much richer, type of schoolboy”, but two things <em>are</em> clear:</p><ul><li id="7f3b" data-selectable-paragraph="">A whole load of them did it; and</li><li id="9994" data-selectable-paragraph="">Their understanding of what an Etonian might look like was inconsistent at best, for example:</li></ul></div></div><div><p id="fa38" data-selectable-paragraph="">Meanwhile at least six different girls dressed up as a “girl graduate”, “girl undergraduate” or “Girton girl”, making “woman at university” easily one of the most popular costumes for girls. In 1887! The local university, Adelaide, had allowed women to study informally since it opened in 1876, and started admitting them formally <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/about/university-profile/history/#progressive-institution" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in 1881</a>; that made it the first university in Australia to have women students, and is pretty early as far as the world at large is concerned. (Though it certainly wasn’t, as the page above claims, the second ever university to admit women). The university’s first woman graduate, Edith Emily Dornwell (also its first ever science graduate of any gender), had graduated in 1885, two years before this ball.</p></div><div><div><p id="280a" data-selectable-paragraph="">Heartwarming though the popularity of the “woman student” costume is, the costumes themselves aren’t anything <em>too </em>special. My 132-years-in-retrospect awards go instead to a selection of participants with more unusual costumes.</p><h2 id="2843" data-selectable-paragraph="">Special Award for Most Eye-Rollingly Specific Costume</h2><p id="8d2b" data-selectable-paragraph="">It’s Herbert Lander aged 17 years old, dressed as Boccaccio! Congratulations, Herbert!</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/40/1*Cp1kI8RKlgw5cfCptj1fUw.jpeg?q=20" width="685" height="1024" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="685" height="1024" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="64df" data-selectable-paragraph="">Why has Herbert come dressed specifically as Boccaccio and not, say, “Italian nobleman” like everyone else? Who can say, but if my increasingly vague memories of being a grumpy 17-year-old in Adelaide serve, probably: because this way he gets to talk about how he’s definitely read Boccaccio.</p><h2 id="bf1f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Special Award for Most Dedicated Prop Work</h2><p id="ff35" data-selectable-paragraph="">It’s John Carter aged 11, as a Red Cross Knight!</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/40/1*v3tIM9ygTD2Uco_F7Sxe8g.jpeg?q=20" width="686" height="1024" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="686" height="1024" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="8152" data-selectable-paragraph="">I would not personally bring both a large wooden shield and an <em>enormous banner a foot taller than myself that I have to carry constantly </em>to a party. But maybe that’s why I’ve spent my afternoon looking at old photos and writing a Medium post that nobody will ever read again after next Tuesday, while John is still being written about well after his death for something he did as an eleven-year-old child. Good work, John.</p><h2 id="0055" data-selectable-paragraph="">Special Award for the <em>Costume That Made Me Spend The Most Time Thinking “Huh, What?” And Googling</em>:</h2><p id="e692" data-selectable-paragraph="">Well done to Geraldine Hargrave, aged 17, dressed as “Masherette”!</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/40/1*LbaeSzlMRgaGKPrh335OPw.jpeg?q=20" width="690" height="1024" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="690" height="1024" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="0b48" data-selectable-paragraph="">What’s a Masherette? Well, it’s still not totally clear to me: most of the old books I could find talking about masherettes are just instruction manuals for costume parties, all of which urge you to go as a Masherette but none of which explain what a Masherette actually <em>is.</em></p><p id="8642" data-selectable-paragraph="">But I <em>think</em> it might go something like this: a “masher” is a dandy, a man who is well-dressed to the point of excess. (In some contexts it also has implications of making excessive advances to women; “ugh no, I wouldn’t, I’ve heard stuff about him,” you might say to your friends about today’s equivalent of a masher. But sometimes it’s just a guy who wears nice clothes and is perhaps quite flirty.)</p><p id="5be2" data-selectable-paragraph="">A <em>masherette </em>seems to be just <em>a woman dressed as a masher (</em>as distinct from “a female version of a masher”: not “a flirty well-dressed woman” but rather “a woman in costume as a flirty well-dressed man<em>, </em>except not wearing trousers because it’s 1887 and that would be extremely scandalous”). That explains why the word mostly comes up in relation to costume parties. See eg the Auckland Evening Star, 3 October 1889, reporting on one fancy dress ball:</p><blockquote><p id="a570" data-selectable-paragraph="">Miss Thornton’s costume, as dashing coquettish “Masherette,” was one of the most piquant and attractive in the room, and undoubtedly the best-sustained character.</p></blockquote><p id="7b56" data-selectable-paragraph="">Or The Wanganui Herald, 18 July 1885:</p><blockquote><p id="6844" data-selectable-paragraph="">The dresses chosen by the ladies showed that a considerable amount of ingenuity had been used in selecting the characters. For novelty and originality the “Masherette” of Miss Brassey took first place; this young lady sported the orthodox stand-up collar, eye glass, dress coat and shirt-front of the swell masher, and altogether looked the character chosen.</p></blockquote><p id="c7a1" data-selectable-paragraph="">But if anyone knows anything more about masherettes, please do let me know!</p><h2 id="1b88" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Special Award for The Whole Situation Here</strong></h2><p id="eeb4" data-selectable-paragraph="">It’s Master Rymill, aged 15, as Pantaloon — well done Master Rymill!</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/40/1*alZYUwDpPuLBzBNiQBdJPQ.jpeg?q=20" width="688" height="1024" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="688" height="1024" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="9d67" data-selectable-paragraph="">I love this: the way it draws attention to the extraordinarily ugly three-legged table; the polka-dots on his face; the weird alien tuft on top of his head; the belled knee-frills, and his super-casual pose that makes them fall awry; the way his costume shows <em>so much dedication </em>and yet his face shows <em>nothing</em>, not doubt, not self-consciousness, not triumph, not a feigned in-character snarl, just an unrelenting stare that refuses to acknowledge its surroundings<em>.</em></p><h2 id="39d7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Special Award for Being Interestingly Different To The Costume We’d Expect To See Now</h2><p id="2594" data-selectable-paragraph="">It’s Augustus Honner aged 17 years old, dressed as Robin Hood! Picture Robin Hood, and then look at Augustus:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/40/1*QXSTBWH3fsdfcueRHSYpig.jpeg?q=20" width="688" height="1024" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="688" height="1024" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="05e4" data-selectable-paragraph="">Interesting, right? The bow and perhaps the boots could double in a Robin Hood costume for 2019, but the fur-edged coat and the <em>wrong sort of jaunty hat </em>are totally out of the question. Also, wow, this photographer had so many props. We’ve seen the fern before, but a tree stump!</p><h2 id="60d8" data-selectable-paragraph="">Special Award for Technological Innovation</h2><p id="5ed2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Our final special award goes to Antonia Bircher aged 10 years, dressed as a telephone!</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/40/1*YGOfgI5nCOp-274d-IOe0g.jpeg?q=20" width="696" height="1024" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="696" height="1024" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="c850" data-selectable-paragraph="">Normally I don’t approve of costumes that are mostly headwear, but that dress is <em>delightful </em>so let’s just pretend it’s what the base of a telephone looked like in 1887. More importantly, this is so forward-thinking — it would be <a href="http://sahistoryhub.com.au/subjects/telephone" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another five years</a> before the first domestic telephones were installed in South Australia (although from 1882 there were a few at the post office that you could pay to use). I also like the very contemporary standing-in-a-corner-trying-to-hear telephone call stance.</p><h2 id="bb0d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Grand Prize for Best Costume, Children’s Fancy Dress Ball of 1887</h2><p id="5941" data-selectable-paragraph="">And finally, congratulations to A. May aged 14 years old, dressed as a Clock! How do you dress as a clock, you ask? Like this, obviously:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/42/1*R1sEnNwVdhhusF8OlIFnAA.jpeg?q=20" width="702" height="1024" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="702" height="1024" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="3c7f" data-selectable-paragraph="">The crown! The Season-Three-Jenny-Humphrey accessories! The numbers that are just <em>everywhere! </em>The way her dress is a clock with a clock on it, and also she’s carrying a bag which is another clock! The layered tulle! <em>Magnificent. </em>A worthy winner.</p></div></div></div></div>
