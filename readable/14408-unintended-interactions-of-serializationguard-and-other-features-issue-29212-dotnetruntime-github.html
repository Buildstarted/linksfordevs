And until that evidence appears I don't see us doing anything about it.</p></blockquote><p>People use Process.Start and file writes because it's the most straightforward thing. Take that away, and people will just find the next straightforward thing (registry, WMI, whatever). It's easy to anticipate the next step here - this feature doesn't have a broad enough stroke.</p><p>If we go and block the next straighforward thing too, it adds to the argument of getting unintended interactions in many places. If we don't block it, this feature becomes pretty much useless (a speed bump that everyone knows how to drive around). Neither of those options make me feel like this is a sustainable design.</p></div></div></div></div>
