<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Most product managers are asked for advice on breaking into the field. It’s understandable: Product management has become a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coveted-job-title-for-m-b-a-s-product-manager-1456933303">desirable job</a>. It’s often a “chicken and egg” role, where you need experience to <em>get</em> the job, but you can’t gain experience until you <em>have</em> the job.</p>



<p>Companies have a low appetite for risk when hiring product managers. They prefer false negatives in the hiring process to false positives (for candidates who aren’t a definite “yes,” they’d rather say “no”). A good product management hire can be a force multiplier for their team, but a bad hire can derail a much larger group of people.</p>



<p>“Breaking in” is hard, and that’s okay; everything worth doing is hard. But it isn’t impossible. The majority of people in product management followed one of these paths:</p>



<ol><li><strong>They transferred internally within a company. </strong>An internal transfer was my path; I moved from sales strategy to product management.</li><li><strong>They entered through a rotational program.</strong> There are many, including Google APM, Facebook RPM, LinkedIn APM, and more.</li><li><strong>A post-MBA intake. </strong><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-changes-the-way-it-recruits-m-b-a-s-11582021802">Amazon</a>, for example, is known for hiring recently graduated MBAs to product management roles.&nbsp;As are Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe.</li><li><strong>Specialized knowledge in an industry. </strong>E.g., someone with deep expertise in crypto could be a great product manager candidate at Coinbase, even without prior product management experience.</li><li><strong>More rarely, an acquisition or acqui-hire. </strong>Many large companies convert founders to product managers during the acquisition process.</li></ol>



<p>This list isn’t exhaustive. E.g., with a strong referral, you may be able to land a product role at a company without prior experience. But this is an exception, not the norm.</p>



<p>Of the above five, 1-3 are by far the most common, and 2-3 are mechanically similar, so I’ll group them. We end up with two main paths: “internal transfer” and “graduate intake.”</p>







<p>I’m an advocate of this path because it worked for me. I went to an oddball college in Australia, I didn’t go to a top business school, and through a combination of luck and persistence, I landed in product management at LinkedIn.</p>



<p>Experienced internal transfers tend to be strong candidates because product management is a deeply collaborative role. Expertise in another function, understanding the mechanics of the business and having strong intra-company relationships are all advantages on which you should capitalize.</p>



<p>Those I know who have taken this path have done, at a minimum, something like this:</p>



<ol><li>They joined a company that supports internal mobility. LinkedIn is useful for research; look for companies where people transferred internally.</li><li>They crushed their role. Every hiring manager will look at current performance as an indicator of future performance and potential.</li><li>They got closer to the product management team: This could mean being part of a function that works closely with product management or working on a particular project to get you closer to product management.</li><li>They built knowledge, a reputation, and relationships that made them uniquely qualified for a product management role at their company.</li></ol>



<p>Doing 2-4 well will put you in a strong position for product management when the right role arises. Ultimately, without product management experience, you need someone to take a bet on you. Crushing your job, building relevant knowledge, and developing a reputation and relationships will get you there.</p>



<p>You’ll often take a level cut when transferring internally, and that’s fine. Companies look after good people, and you’ll make it back “up” quickly. </p>



<p>Reid Hoffman, a LinkedIn co-founder, has a <a href="https://amzn.to/3iIKW6x">great book</a> on navigating your career, with intra-company mobility as a central theme. Oddly enough, it’s the book that inspired me to apply at LinkedIn years ago.</p>







<p>“Graduate intake” is arguably the most direct—and most competitive—path to product management. For those early in their career, Google <a href="https://careers.google.com/programs/apm/">APM</a>, Facebook <a href="http://www.fbrpms.com/">RPM</a>, and LinkedIn <a href="https://careers.linkedin.com/apm">APM</a> probably the most coveted.</p>



<p>There are many more, including <a href="https://www.uberapms.com/">Uber</a>, <a href="https://www.lyft.com/careers/apm">Lyft</a>, <a href="http://www.twitterapm.com/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://asana.com/jobs/university-recruiting">Asana</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/company/careers/graduates/apm">Atlassian</a>, <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/company/careers/university-recruiting/product/product-apm/">Salesforce</a>, <a href="https://yahooapms.com/">Yahoo</a>, and <a href="https://www.yelp.careers/us/en">Yelp</a>. Microsoft and Dropbox also hire early-career product managers, but they don’t have structured rotational programs.</p>



<p>While you don’t need an MBA to succeed, many large companies actively recruit from MBA programs; Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe, to name a few. The hiring process at large and recognizable companies is fiercely competitive, so it’s worth also exploring smaller companies and startups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While I’m not going to go into the details of the interview process, keep in mind that you need to differentiate yourself. There are a few ways you can do this, none of which are unique to product management:</p>



<ol><li>Gain relevant experience, like an internship or side-project.</li><li>Get a referral or recommendation from someone at the company.</li><li>Have exceptional credentials: School, GPA (for undergrads), etc.</li></ol>



<p>Aim for 2-3 of the above to get an interview. In my experience, once you get the interview, your resume doesn’t matter. Unless you’re going for a specialized or senior role, interview performance will be the most significant factor. &nbsp;</p>







<p>Remember that companies <em>want </em>you to succeed at interviews. The recruiter will guide you through the process, which varies across companies. The two books that were most helpful to me were <a href="https://amzn.to/3h71s04">Cracking the PM Interview</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/30WpsNE">Decode and Conquer</a>, which both cover the interview process in great detail.</p>



<p>At a high level, every company is looking for competency in:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Product sense: </strong>Understanding products, and the ability to critique, learn from, and design them.</li><li><strong>Leadership and management: </strong>Inspiring others to achieve a shared vision, leading a team, and navigating a complex organization.</li><li><strong>Communication: </strong>Communicating effectively, creating clarity and alignment, managing expectations, and building relationships.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Problem-solving: </strong>Breaking down nuanced problems into their component parts, tackling each piece methodically, and solving the problem.</li><li><strong>Strategy &amp; planning:</strong> Understanding leverage, 80/20, and the ability to define a multi-step strategy.</li><li><strong>Analytical skills: </strong>A/B testing, using metrics to measure product success, and making thoughtful data-driven decisions.</li><li><strong>Business acumen:</strong> Pricing, competitive analysis, sales models, and how product value drives business value.</li><li><strong>Technical ability: </strong>Understanding<strong> </strong>technology and technical complexity, working effectively with engineering, and a vision for how technology is changing.</li></ol>



<p>How these are weighted will differ between companies. Google, for example, is known for screening more heavily on technical ability. Facebook, LinkedIn, and Amazon less-so. Often, it’s role dependent, e.g., a product manager at AWS will need to be technical.</p>



<p>As products and companies grow in complexity and functions become more specialized, I believe that product management will, over time, trend towards a more generalized “GM” role. For that reason, on average, I think we’ll see “on the tools” technical skills become less important, provided you have a base level of fluency, can partner effectively with engineering, and stay attuned to technology trends.</p>



<p>When preparing, I found it helpful to deeply study a few different products and analyze them using the <a href="https://www.impactinterview.com/2016/06/circles-method-product-design-framework/">CIRCLES Method</a>. I’d recommend choosing a few products you use heavily; this will make it far more authentic (I used Spotify.)</p>







<p>LinkedIn is where I work. The LinkedIn product hiring process looks for: product sense, execution, communication &amp; cross-functional ability, management &amp; leadership, and ecosystem thinking (i.e., considering how your product fits into the broader LinkedIn product ecosystem.)</p>



<p>The three most common paths to product management at LinkedIn are the APM program, internal transfer, or experience external hire. The <a href="https://careers.linkedin.com/apm">LinkedIn APM program</a> is fantastic. Many of the best product managers I know are, or have been, part of the APM program. As you might expect, product management opportunities at LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?f_C=1337&amp;keywords=product%20manager">are posted on LinkedIn</a>.</p>







<p>I’ve narrowed this down to the top three “must-read” books and articles for those looking to better understand and break into product management:</p>



<p><strong>Books:</strong></p>



<ol><li><a href="https://amzn.to/2CwaHI3">Cracking the PM Interview</a>: This was the book that I studied the most while interviewing internally.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/30ZDFta">Decode and Conquer</a>: This was the book I studied the <em>second-most</em> while interviewing internally.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Management-Launch-Career-ebook/dp/B083D667N2">Principles of Product Management</a>, by Peter Yang: This is a helpful overview of the “mechanics” of product management. Light on vision, heavy on process.</li></ol>
