Balaji will evangelize for both crypto and for Coinbase, educating the world and recruiting crypto-first talent to the company.</p><p id="a686" class="gt gu em at gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg ee">In addition to welcoming Balaji, we’re also very pleased to welcome the Earn.com team to Coinbase. Earn allows senders to pay users in cryptocurrency to reply to emails and complete tasks. We’re going to be doubling down on the Earn business within Coinbase, as they have built a paid email product that is arguably one of the earliest practical blockchain applications to achieve meaningful traction.
