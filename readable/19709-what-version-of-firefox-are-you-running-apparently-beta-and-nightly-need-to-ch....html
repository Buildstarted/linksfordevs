Obviously the latter didn't happen.</p><p>Chances are a connection failure in the browser console is unrelated, the browser console is basically constantly spewing error messages, you should just ignore them unless they are in response to something you did.</p><p>All I can really suggest over the internet is to try reinstalling your addons - that might work - in which case I would assume they just got uninstalled somehow. If it doesn't I'm not sure what to suggest, and I can't realistically debug something too complex over HN comments. You might just have to wait for mozilla to publish an update to the browser that fixes this properly.</p><p>I do want to emphasize that I'm just some dude on the internet being helpful by the way, not associated with Mozilla or anything.</p><p>Edit: Just saw this error message you also posted: """WebExtensions: failed to add new intermediate certificate:"""</p><p>That sounds like an issue that happened when installing the .xpi? Did it give any other related debugging information?</p></div></div></div></div>
