	    <p>I and my wife finally managed to visit the USA like we wanted to do for quite a while now. This post is a mix of impressions, tips and photos from the trip.

I believe that is quite hard to take landscape photographs already and even harder to take them with time constraints at places never seen before. So let‚Äôs just enjoy the holiday and take few photos for our ‚Äútrip down memory lane‚Äù photo book. It was also a good ‚Ä¶ <a href="http://sebasphotography.com/trip-to-the-usa-los-angeles/">Continue reading <span>Trip to the USA ‚Äì Los Angeles</span></a></p>
