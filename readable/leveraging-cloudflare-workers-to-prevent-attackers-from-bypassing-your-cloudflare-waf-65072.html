<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><div><div><p><img src="https://sandrino.dev/me.jpeg" alt="Sandrino Di Mattia"></p><p>Sandrino Di Mattia<!-- --> / <!-- -->July 31, 2020</p></div><p>6 min read<!-- --> â€¢ <!-- -->268 views</p></div></div><h2 id="introduction"><p>Introduction<a aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction">#</a></p></h2><p>Over the past few years the popularity and usage of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> has seen a tremendous growth, really living up to their mission of building a better Internet by making it faster and more secure.</p><img alt="Cloudflare Overview" src="https://sandrino.dev/_next/static/images/cloudflare-d9104bd5a9fb9889f7403a975723eb9e.jpeg"><p>And while Cloudflare adds a lot to the table from a security point of view with their Bot Detection, WAF, DDoS Protection, ... there's still a chance that all of these protections can be bypassed by attacking the Origin IP directly. This is not an issue with Cloudflare itself, but with how the actual web applications have been configured to accept traffic. Tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.crimeflare.org:82/cfs.html#box">CrimeFlare</a> try to map Cloudflare protected sites to their original IP address.</p><img alt="Cloudflair Bypass" src="https://sandrino.dev/_next/static/images/bypass-f50c38867d3d04d7c8ce6959966615fe.jpeg"><p>Ideally your applications should only accept traffic from Cloudflare, but this introduces some level of complexity depending on the implementation. There's also a lot of content available today describing techniques on how to bypass Cloudflare and find unprotected web applications where the Origin IP can be attacked:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/cloud-security/cloudflare-bypassing-cloud-security/">Introducing CFire: Evading CloudFlare Security Protections</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://enciphers.com/bypassing-cloudflare-waf-to-get-more-vulnerabilities/">Bypassing Cloudflare WAF to get more vulnerabilities</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.detectify.com/2019/07/31/bypassing-cloudflare-waf-with-the-origin-server-ip-address/">Bypassing Cloudflare WAF with the origin server IP address</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.christophetd.fr/bypassing-cloudflare-using-internet-wide-scan-data/">CloudFlair: Bypassing Cloudflare using Internet-wide scan data</a></li></ul><h2 id="existing-solutions"><p>Existing Solutions<a aria-label="anchor" href="#existing-solutions">#</a></p></h2><p>There's several solutions documented which will make it harder for attackers and in some cases will really solve the issue.</p><h3 id="keeping-the-origin-ip-hidden"><p>Keeping the Origin IP hidden<a aria-label="anchor" href="#keeping-the-origin-ip-hidden">#</a></p></h3><p>A lot of content suggests doing everything in your power to hide the Origin IP, like avoid having DNS record pointing to your IP address directly, being careful with MX records, disabling XML-RPC Pingback, ...</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">Security trough obscurity</a> at its best and not a true solution.</p><h3 id="only-accepting-traffic-from-cloudflare"><p>Only accepting traffic from Cloudflare<a aria-label="anchor" href="#only-accepting-traffic-from-cloudflare">#</a></p></h3><p>An other type of advice that is commonly given is restricting access to your application based on IP address ranges, only allowing traffic originating from Cloudflare:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/force-the-traffic-through-cloudflare-even-on-direct-aws-link/151513">Force the traffic through Cloudflare even on direct AWS link</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/prevent-users-bypassing-cloudflare-to-access-my-site/4606">Prevent direct access to IP</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/prevent-users-bypassing-cloudflare-to-access-my-site/4606">Prevent Users Bypassing Cloudflare To Access My Site</a></li></ul><p>Even though this makes things slightly harder for attackers, it still doesn't solve the issue. Nothing prevents an attacker from also using Cloudflare and attacking your Origin IP through Cloudflare. Your servers would not be able to distinguish traffic coming from your Cloudflare account vs. traffic coming from the attacker's Cloudflare account.</p><p>This also introduces some complexity: you'll need to setup some automated tooling which will constantly monitor <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/">Cloudflare's IP Ranges</a> and change your firewall rules to make sure you don't block new IP addresses used by Cloudflare.</p><h3 id="authenticated-origin-pulls"><p>Authenticated Origin Pulls<a aria-label="anchor" href="#authenticated-origin-pulls">#</a></p></h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/204899617-Authenticated-Origin-Pulls">Authenticated Origin Pulls</a> give you the guarantee that the request originates from Cloudflare and has been processed by the WAF.</p><img alt="Authenticated Origin Pulls" src="https://sandrino.dev/_next/static/images/origin-pulls-17e0653b064322de7c5b4c79133d5f28.jpeg"><p>This capability is based on TLS client certificate authentication and will require some changes to your web server. This is also not always an option depending on where you host your application (PaaS and Serverless environments for example):</p><pre mb="4"><code>ssl_client_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/cloudflare.crt<span>;</span>
ssl_verify_client on<span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>The reason why this feature does not solve the bypass problem is because it guarantees that traffic comes from Cloudflare, but there are no guarantees that the request originated from your Cloudflare account. This is because your web server will only validate that the client certificate is signed by the Cloudflare CA chain.</p><h3 id="cloudflare-argo-tunnel"><p>Cloudflare Argo Tunnel<a aria-label="anchor" href="#cloudflare-argo-tunnel">#</a></p></h3><p>The best solution to this problem is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/reference/how-it-works/">Argo Tunnel</a>, which creates an encrypted tunnel between your web server and your Cloudflare account. With this feature, you don't have to make your application publicly available on the internet.</p><img alt="Cloudflare Argo Tunnel" src="https://sandrino.dev/_next/static/images/argo-b53ac3da068987bc7d114633f21d2a22.jpeg"><p>This solution does come at an extra cost (including a cost per GB) and at might not work in all environments. Argo Tunnel currently requires to run an agent on your web server:</p><pre mb="4"><code>cloudflared tunnel --hostname www.acme.com http://localhost:8000
</code></pre><p>Running an agent like <code>cloudflared</code> might not be an option if you don't have full access to your hosting environment (PaaS and Serverless platforms).</p><h3 id="an-alternative-using-cloudflare-workers"><p>An alternative using Cloudflare Workers<a aria-label="anchor" href="#an-alternative-using-cloudflare-workers">#</a></p></h3><p>There's an alternative solution similar to <strong>Authenticated Origin Pulls</strong> which we can build using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>. By using Cloudflare Workers, we can change the request before it is forwarded to the origin.</p><p>What this allows us to do is to configure a secret on both sides (Cloudflare and the web application). The web application can then decide to only accept requests for which the secret is provided (in a header for example). This could be a static value, a HMAC signed request, a JWT ... In this example we're going to secure our origin using a shared secret:</p><img alt="Shared Secret" src="https://sandrino.dev/_next/static/images/secret-0c68f7b1e0ac8e2b32a0b5a52e10f8db.jpeg"><p>Let's start by creating a worker which will add an additional header to the request:</p><pre mb="4"><code><span>function</span> <span>handleRequest</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> newRequest <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Request</span><span>(</span>request<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  newRequest<span>.</span><span>headers</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>'x-cf-key'</span><span>,</span> <span>CF_SECRET</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span>newRequest<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'fetch'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  event<span>.</span><span>respondWith</span><span>(</span><span>handleRequest</span><span>(</span>event<span>.</span><span>request</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>The <code>CF_SECRET</code> will be replaced with an environment variable which we can configure on the worker. This setting will contain our shared secret:</p><img alt="Worker Secret" src="https://sandrino.dev/_next/static/images/worker-secret-bc1ac402fad39e509c66c30c654cc793.jpeg"><p>As a final step I'm going to enable the worker for the domain on which my application runs:</p><img alt="Enable Worker" src="https://sandrino.dev/_next/static/images/enable-worker-609723fa27b06a2d32462469e10e9eeb.jpeg"><p>My application runs on Heroku (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hello-world-sandrino.herokuapp.com/">https://hello-world-sandrino.herokuapp.com/</a>) and is also proxied through Cloudflare (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hello.sandrino.run/">https://hello.sandrino.run</a>). I've created a simple page which lists all of the request headers and for any request served through Cloudflare we can now see the additional header with the shared secret:</p><img alt="Secret forwarded in a header" src="https://sandrino.dev/_next/static/images/header-9be1db69ba905d0cc331363d1fb49f70.jpeg"><p>Note: You will want to treat this header as a secret. It should not be leaked to your users.</p><p>The final step is to make sure requests are only served when a <code>X-CF-KEY</code> header is provided and it contains a valid shared secret. In the example below I'm illustrating how this can be done using a middleware in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, but this can be done in virtually any framework or web server. Most of these allow you to run logic before requests are served and that's the point where you would validate the presence of this header.</p><pre mb="4"><code><span>const</span> app <span>=</span> <span>express</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>...</span>

app<span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>req<span>,</span> res<span>,</span> next</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> key <span>=</span> req<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'x-cf-key'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>key <span>!==</span> <span>'a618e605-fd2d-4e0e-8fe0-139a41193945'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> res<span>.</span><span>sendStatus</span><span>(</span><span>404</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>next</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>,</span> req<span>,</span> res<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

app<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'/'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>req<span>,</span> res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  res<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>'homepage'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>Here's the final result. Requests made through Cloudflare are accepted and served as expected because Cloudflare will provide a valid <code>X-CF-KEY</code> header to our web application. Requests that are made directly to the web application will fail because the header is not present.</p><img alt="Enforcing the header" src="https://sandrino.dev/_next/static/images/enforce-93024817aa369503e3ccbfd21dab5888.gif"><h2 id="-success"><p>âœ… Success!<a aria-label="anchor" href="#-success">#</a></p></h2><p>Through the use of Cloudflare Workers we can guarantee that the request originates from your Cloudflare account which can be used as a mechanism to prevent bypassing of your Cloudflare configuration. This is a valid solution in case you cannot leverage Argo Tunnels in your environment.</p><p>If possible you should configure Cloudflare account to use Full (strict) SSL/TLS encryption and Authenticated Origin Pulls for improved security and to prevent MITM attacks.</p></article></div></div>
