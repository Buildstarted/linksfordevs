<div>
<p>This post follows on from <a href="https://andrewlock.net/inserting-middleware-between-userouting-and-useendpoints-as-a-library-author-part-1/">my previous post</a> - if you haven't already, I strongly recommend reading that one first.</p>
<p>These posts are in response to a question from a reader about how library authors can ensure consumers of their library insert the library's middleware at the right point in their app middleware pipeline. In the previous post I showed an approach that allowed you to ensure your middleware runs before a given (named) piece of middleware, for example just before the <code>EndpointMiddleware</code> added via a call to <code>UseEndpoints()</code>.</p>
<p>One of the limitations of this approach is that you can only run your middleware <em>before</em> a given named middleware. There's no way to run your middleware <em>after</em> a named middleware. For example, maybe I want my middleware to run immediately <em>after</em> the call to <code>UseRouting()</code>. </p>
<p>In my approach from the previous post, there's no way to achieve that - you can only select a middleware to run <em>before</em>. In this post I adapt the approach to allow you to specify which middleware you want to run after. I warn you now though, it's not very pretty…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://disqus.com/by/disqus_5fuKnO8yCp/">Kamushek</a> pointed out a significant flaw in the approach taken in these posts - you can only have a single library use this approach to add middleware. That's a shame, but I'm not really sure I would recommend using these approaches anyway: they're more of an intellectual exercise!</p>

<h2 id="the-middleware-pipeline-is-built-in-reverse">The middleware pipeline is built in reverse<a href="#the-middleware-pipeline-is-built-in-reverse"></a></h2>
<p>In the previous post, I used the <code>RequestDelegate</code> passed in to our custom middleware's constructor to discover what the <em>next</em> middleware is. The middleware pipeline is built up is by creating an instance of middleware, and obtaining a reference to it's <code>Invoke</code> method. This reference is used to create the <code>RequestDelegate</code> for the <em>previous</em> middleware. So each middleware has a reference to the next middleware in the pipeline.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/c7937640a4079465d36441724933eae5a9ca0085/src/Http/Http/src/Builder/ApplicationBuilder.cs#L82-L109">That means the pipeline is built from the end first, working back to the start of the pipeline</a>. Each <em>earlier</em> middleware "wraps" the rest of the pipeline.</p>

</picture>
<p>This is a problem for us when we want to add middleware <em>after</em> a given named middleware like the <code>EndpointRoutingMiddleware</code>. When the pipeline is being built, there's no way to know what the "previous" middleware in the pipeline will be - we're building the pipeline back-to-front, so it hasn't been created yet!</p>
<p>Of course at <em>runtime</em> the opposite is true. Middleware <em>early</em> in the pipeline can send signals to later middleware, for example by setting values in the <code>HttpContext.Items</code> collection, or via a service in the DI container.</p>
<p>In order to insert middleware at a specific point in your pipeline, we could use these two facts in combination, as I show in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="when-in-doubt-add-moar-middleware">When in doubt, add moar middleware<a href="#when-in-doubt-add-moar-middleware"></a></h2>
<p>I've described two features of the middleware pipeline that we can use to achieve our goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>At build time (and at runtime) a given middleware can inspect the type of the next middleware/<code>RequestDelegate</code> that will run </li>
<li>At runtime, middleware can send messages to <em>later</em> middleware</li>
</ul>
<p>The approach we'll use is:</p>
<ul>
<li>When explicitly adding middleware to the pipeline (in <code>Startup.Configure</code>), intercept the call, and add two extra piece of middleware - one before the target middleware (<code>NameCheckMiddleware</code>), and one after (<code>ConditionalMiddleware</code>). This is similar to the <code>AnalysisMiddleware</code> approach I showed in <a href="https://andrewlock.net/inserting-middleware-between-userouting-and-useendpoints-as-a-library-author-part-1/">the previous post</a>. </li>
<li>Record the name of the "wrapped" middleware at build time</li>
<li>At runtime, pass the name of the wrapped middleware from the "pre-" middleware to the "-post" middleware</li>
<li>If the name indicates it's the middleware we're looking for, run the extra functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all a bit confusing - hopefully the example below makes more sense. In this example we want to run our middleware immediately after the call to <code>UseRouting()</code>.</p>

<p>Like I said at the start, it's not pretty. But it does work…</p>
<h2 id="implementing-the-middleware">Implementing the middleware<a href="#implementing-the-middleware"></a></h2>
<p>Hopefully you have a grasp of what we're trying to achieve here, so lets show some code. There's not really many additional concepts from last time, but I'll provide all the necessary code for completeness.</p>
<p>We'll start with the <code>NameCheckMiddleware</code>. This is the "pre-" middleware that records the name of the middleware being wrapped:</p>
<pre><code><span>internal</span> <span>class</span> <span>NameCheckerMiddleware</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>RequestDelegate</span> _next<span>;</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>string</span> _wrappedMiddlewareName<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>NameCheckerMiddleware</span><span>(</span><span>RequestDelegate</span> next<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        _wrappedMiddlewareName <span>=</span> next<span>.</span>Target<span>.</span><span>GetType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>FullName<span>;</span>
        _next <span>=</span> next<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>Task</span> <span>Invoke</span><span>(</span><span>HttpContext</span> httpContext<span>)</span>

        httpContext<span>.</span>Items<span>[</span><span>"WrappedMiddlewareName"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> _wrappedMiddlewareName<span>;</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>_next</span><span>(</span>httpContext<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The name of the <code>RequestDelegate</code> is calculated in the constructor, i.e. only once, when the middleware is constructed. In the <code>Invoke</code> method we set the middleware in the <code>HttpContext.Items</code> dictionary, for use by our "post-" middleware, the <code>ConditionalMiddleware</code> shown below:</p>
<pre><code><span>internal</span> <span>class</span> <span>ConditionalMiddleware</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>RequestDelegate</span> _next<span>;</span>

        <span>await</span> <span>_next</span><span>(</span>httpContext<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The difference between this <code>ConditionalMiddleware</code> and <a href="https://andrewlock.net/inserting-middleware-between-userouting-and-useendpoints-as-a-library-author-part-1/#inserting-middleware-before-useendpoints">the version from my previous post</a> is that we don't know at the middleware build-time whether a given <code>ConditionalMiddleware</code> instance is the one we need. Instead, we have to check the <code>HttpContext.Items</code> dictionary to see what the previous middleware was. If it's the one we're looking for, then we run the extra code.</p>
<p>To add these middleware to the pipeline we provide a custom <code>IApplicationBuilder</code>, just as we did in the last post. The code here is almost identical; the only difference is we're adding both the <code>ConditionalMidleware</code> <em>and</em> the <code>NameCheckerMiddleware</code> in the <code>Use()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code><span>internal</span> <span>class</span> <span>ConditionalMiddlewareBuilder</span> <span>:</span> <span>IApplicationBuilder</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In order to use the custom builder, we can use the same <code>IStartupFilter</code> as in the last post:</p>
<pre><code><span>internal</span> <span>class</span> <span>ConditionalMiddlewareStartupFilter</span> <span>:</span> <span>IStartupFilter</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>string</span> _runAfterMiddlewareName<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>ConditionalMiddlewareStartupFilter</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> runAfterMiddlewareName<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        _runAfterMiddlewareName <span>=</span> runAfterMiddlewareName<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> Action<span>&lt;</span>IApplicationBuilder<span>&gt;</span> <span>Configure</span><span>(</span>Action<span>&lt;</span>IApplicationBuilder<span>&gt;</span> next<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> builder <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>var</span> wrappedBuilder <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>ConditionalMiddlewareBuilder</span><span>(</span>builder<span>,</span> _runAfterMiddlewareName<span>)</span><span>;</span>
            <span>next</span><span>(</span>wrappedBuilder<span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, a couple of extension methods to make adding the startup filter easy:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>ConditionalMiddlewareExtensions</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>IServiceCollection</span> <span>AddConditionalMiddleware</span><span>(</span><span>this</span> <span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>,</span> <span>string</span> afterMiddleware<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> services<span>.</span><span><span>AddTransient</span><span>&lt;</span><span>IStartupFilter</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span>_ <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>ConditionalMiddlewareStartupFilter</span><span>(</span>afterMiddleware<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>IServiceCollection</span> <span>AddConditionalMiddlewareAfterRouting</span><span>(</span><span>this</span> <span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> services<span>.</span><span>AddConditionalMiddleware</span><span>(</span><span>"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.EndpointRoutingMiddleware"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>AddConditionalMiddlewareAfterRouting()</code> method looks for the <code>EndpointRoutingMiddleware</code> added by the <code>UseRouting()</code> call. All that remains is to call the method in our app:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Startup</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>

    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Configure</span><span>(</span><span>IApplicationBuilder</span> app<span>)</span>

        app<span>.</span><span>UseHttpsRedirection</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        app<span>.</span><span>UseStaticFiles</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        app<span>.</span><span>UseRouting</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        

        app<span>.</span><span>UseAuthentication</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        app<span>.</span><span>UseAuthorization</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        app<span>.</span><span>UseEndpoints</span><span>(</span>endpoints <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span>
            endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapRazorPages</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Just as in the previous post, we only had to add one line, even though there's a <em>lot</em> going on behind the scenes. </p>
<p>Again, this example is just a proof of concept - it doesn't do anything interesting other than print the following log message just after the <code>EndpointRoutingMiddleware</code>:</p>
<pre><code>info: MyTestApp.ConditionalMiddleware<span>[</span>0<span>]</span>
      Running conditional middleware after Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.EndpointRoutingMiddleware
</code></pre>
<p>The approach in this post will have slightly more impact at runtime than the approach in the previous post. While we can do the middleware name check up front at pipeline build time, we need to pass this name through the <code>HttpContext.Items</code> dictionary and add a check for every <code>ConditionalMiddleware</code> instance. This is obviously a pretty small penalty in the grand scheme of things, but it's still something I'd be hesitant forcing on consumers of my library. </p>
<p>As in my last post, as <a href="https://disq.us/p/26yd7u9">highlighted by Kamushek</a>, this technique only works once - you can't add multiple middleware in this way, as they will conflict with each other. That makes the approach of very limited usefulness in my book, but you never know!</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary"></a></h2>
<p>In this post I expanded on the problem posed in my previous post: how can a library author insert middleware at a specific point in a consuming app's middleware pipeline. In the previous post I discussed the approach when you need to place middleware <em>before</em> a specific target middleware. In this post I discuss the slightly trickier task of placing middleware <em>after</em> a target middleware.</p>
<p>The solution in this post requires wrapping each standard piece of middleware in two additional middleware instances. The first, <code>NameCheckerMiddleware</code> records the name of the wrapped middleware, and writes it to the <code>HttpContext.Items</code> dictionary. The subsequent <code>ConditionalMiddleware</code> checks this value to see if the target middleware (e.g. (<code>EndpointRoutingMiddleware</code>) was just executed, and if it was it executes its logic. The end result is definitely not pretty, but it works!</p>
