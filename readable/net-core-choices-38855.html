<p><i>This blog entry is somewhat based on portions of a talk I gave last week to 
the Chicago .NET Users Group.</i></p>

<hr>

<p>.NET Framework first arrived on the scene in 2002.  In the next decade or so, 
it became very successful.  Extremely successful.  It is the platform under countless pieces of software, 
across server, client, and web.  And it is installed on hundreds of millions of computers.</p>

<p>In fact, the specific way that 
.NET Framework is installed helped make it
a victim of its own success.  Because it is installed 
as part of the Windows operating system, there is only one
instance of .NET Framework per computer, shared by
all programs that need it.</p>

<p>An axiom here is that backward compatibility is very important.  
Users hate it when they update a system component
and something else stops working.</p>

<p>When .NET Framework was young, each new release was
bold and cool (hey look, generics! wow, async/await!).  Later, each release became more
and more conservative (er, we've got TLS 1.2 now).</p>

<p>Eventually, .NET Framework became that moment
in a Jenga game where every possible move is too risky.</p>

<h2>Again</h2>

<p>Simultaneously, while .NET Framework was gradually losing
its ability to change, the need for it to change was growing.
When contrasted with other development ecosystems, and viewed
in terms of major industry shifts like cloud and mobile,
.NET was not aging gracefully.</p>

<p>At some point, folks inside Microsoft realized that the future 
of .NET would be much brighter if it could be 
open source, cross platform, and faster.  But .NET Framework
could not be any of those things without (at least the risk of) a compatibility
break.</p>

<p>So it was time for a "reboot", which I mean in the Spider-Man
sense of the word.</p>

<p>Every so often, the Spider-Man movie franchise starts over (usually
from the beginning, as if we all really want to watch Uncle
Ben die one more time).  Why?  Because the actors age, and
because the context keeps changing.</p>

<p>The movie industry borrowed the word "reboot"
from us computer folk so they could apply it to situations where they want to make
something again.  I'm just borrowing the word back, because their
set of connotations are a pretty good fit.
The future of .NET would be much brighter with a younger
actor playing Peter Parker and a fresh approach
across the board.</p>

<p>So if .NET Core were a movie, its title would be ".NET Core:  A Way Forward",
and its movie poster would have three big-name stars above the title:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cross Platform</li>
<li>Open Source</li>
<li>Better Performance</li>
</ul>

<h2>The original</h2>

<p>What does this mean for .NET Framework?</p>

<p>Well, we can go back and re-watch Spider-Man 2 with Doc Ock anytime we want, right?</p>

<p>Actually, at the .NET Conf in September
2019, somebody from Microsoft addressed this issue with the F-word: "FOREVER".</p>

<p>Yes, they actually said, ".NET Framework is going to be supported FOREVER".
Now I'm sure we're all eager to get more detail on what "forever" actually means, 
but it was a strong statement.</p>

<p>And that's good news.  We have a choice.  If we want to stay on
.NET Framework, we can.</p>

<p>The bad news here is that we have a choice.  A choice implies pros
and cons, and there definitely are some, on both sides.</p>

<h2>Choices</h2>

<p>Yes, I was aiming for a chuckle by saying that the existence of a
choice is both good news and bad news, but it's actually true.
A choice implies the requirement to make a decision.
That requires information and time.  It can be stressful to try and 
figure out which sets of pros and cons are preferable.  
It is quite rational to (perhaps secretly) wish that you
did not have a choice.</p>

<p>And not just in software.
All kinds of product companies routinely underestimate the customer 
stress that results when you offer them a choice.</p>

<p>Why does FoodSaver
have so many different models?  Every one of them does essentially the same
thing.  (Here I am, trying to stay excited about this cool new
sous vide approach, but the %#$@ food sealer company is making
me think. And I'm getting angry about it.)
As far as I can tell, their product lineup would be
massively improved if they cut everything down to one model,
or two at most.</p>

<h2>What if .NET Core never happened?</h2>

<p>Did Microsoft have a good reason for
rudely giving its developers a choice?</p>

<p>Personally, I am very thankful that they did.</p>

<p>I mean, can you imagine what .NET would be like right now
if it were still closed-source and Windows-only?</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>To be fair, I am oversimplifying, by talking only about
the forest and ignoring certain trees.</p>

<p>What about the specific pros and cons?</p>

<p>For example, one reason that .NET Core 3.0 is a huge release is
the support for Windows Forms and WPF.  For Windows desktop scenarios, 
this was a big shift in the pros-and-cons.  Without WinForms and WPF, 
every Windows desktop app would have no way to move to .NET Core.</p>

<p>What about the other items that are getting left behind
with .NET Framework?</p>

<ul>
<li>WCF</li>
<li>WWF</li>
<li>ASP.NET 4.x Web Forms</li>
<li>System.Reflection.Emit</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Lots of folks are asking questions.  "Couldn't you'all have moved a few more of these over to
the other side?  Or even just ONE of them?  (meaning, of course, the one that matters most to ME)"</p>

<p>It's not as if folks are asking for backward stuff, like putting Zendaya's MJ into
Tobey Maguire's movies.  This is more like wondering why
the latest round of movies doesn't have Harry Osborn.  Stuff
is getting left behind, and people are wondering why.</p>

<p>I'm not gonna try to defend Microsoft's decisions
at this level of detail.  In each of these cases, bringing
the technology along would reduce the "cons" of .NET Core, but
they had to decide which ones are worth the trouble.
They're smart folks, and I respect their decisions,
but I admit it would probably be harder for me to say that 
if I had a big pile of WCF code.</p>

<h2>Endgame</h2>

<p>Taking the movie analogy a bit further, this is all one big saga.  
Each film is a story of its own, but it also supports the larger arc.</p>

<p>Some of the early films did much better with critics than
they did at the box office.  .NET Core 1.0 was groundbreaking work, but
it wasn't a terribly compelling alternative for people on
.NET Framework to switch.</p>

<p>The GitHub acquisition was that oddball film that is so very important
to the saga even though most people don't understand it.</p>

<p>.NET Core 3.0 is a big-budget summer blockbuster that took
forever to make and is now setting all kinds of box office records.</p>

<p>The Xamarin acquisition can be seen as another result that
proceeded from the same basic decision that caused the 
producers to green-light .NET Core
(make .NET be cross-platform and open source).  So far, the
Xamarin films feel a little bit disconnected from the main
story line.</p>

<p>But this whole thing is heading toward a huge climax called
.NET 5, the point where it all comes together.</p>

<p>(Whimsical aside for MCU fans:  Remember the "on your left" moment from Avengers
Endgame?  .NET 5 is that moment, where all the characters "assemble".  
It is the scene where we learn, just as we suspected, that Miguel de Icaza 
was worthy of Mjolnir all along.)</p>

<p>.NET 5 is the grand ending of this multi-year phase.</p>

<p>And it is also the beginning of the next phase.</p>

<p>A ton of things happened behind the scenes to make this whole thing work, but one 
of the big moments was the difficult decision to leave .NET Framework behind.</p>
