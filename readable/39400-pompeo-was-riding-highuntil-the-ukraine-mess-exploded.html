Two of Thayer’s investors were the Wichita business titans and GOP financiers Charles and David Koch, then the co-owners of  Koch Industries, an energy giant. Pompeo was an appealing soldier-scholar, an erudite and cultivated West Point intellectual, and in the years ahead they helped him at nearly every twist in his business and political career.</p><p>Indeed, while the Kochs have helped finance and boost numerous Republican politicians, few have been bolstered as directly as Pompeo, whose business career and modest wealth both stem heavily from Koch-backed ventures. (In a cabinet stocked with multiple multimillionaires, his financial disclosure forms show a net worth of a few hundred thousand dollars.)</p><p>Pompeo met his current wife, Susan Justice Mostrous, a Wichita native, while she worked as a banker and was closely involved in a deal in which Thayer Aerospace acquired one of her clients. “At our bank, like many Midwestern banks, it’s very relationship-driven,” she told me. “What struck me: He was serious and smart, even, I would say, very Kansan—just really easy, easy to be around.” She recalls that their first date was to Wichita’s Orpheum Theatre, a wearied community fixture Pompeo was helping raise funds to restore. They married in 2000 and Mike formally adopted Susan’s son Nicholas from a previous marriage.</p><p>When Pompeo left Thayer in 2006, he moved over to become president of an oil-field supply business that <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://thinkprogress.org/meet-mike-pompeo-the-congressional-candidate-spawned-by-the-kochtopus-2b5530a2e2ac/&quot;}" href="https://thinkprogress.org/meet-mike-pompeo-the-congressional-candidate-spawned-by-the-kochtopus-2b5530a2e2ac/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> partnered with another Koch company in Brazil, served as a trustee of a Koch-backed think tank, and spoke at rallies organized by the Koch-founded Americans for Prosperity.</p><p>Pompeo ran for Congress in 2010 amid the Tea Party wave against incumbent Raj Goyle, a Democrat whose parents immigrated to the US from India. It was a nasty race that included a pro-Pompeo billboard urging Kansans to “<a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://thinkprogress.org/pompeo-supporter-urges-voters-to-vote-american-against-indian-american-opponent-raj-goyle-8f2b8c9e72b6/&quot;}" href="https://thinkprogress.org/pompeo-supporter-urges-voters-to-vote-american-against-indian-american-opponent-raj-goyle-8f2b8c9e72b6/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vote American</a>.” He proudly touted the backing of KochPAC, saying he was “grateful” for the support since “the Koch companies are among the largest employers in the Fourth District, providing thousands of good jobs for people in south-central Kansas.” He was the nation’s top recipient of Koch money in his congressional race.</p><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--blockquote-embed"><blockquote class="blockquote-embed blockquote-embed--has-top-border"><p>Between the daily briefings, weekly lunches, and extended overseas summits, no member of the cabinet appears to spend as much time with Trump as Pompeo.</p></blockquote></div><p>In Congress, Pompeo then carved out a name for himself as a fierce member of the Tea Party, helping to lead the Benghazi investigation against Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and becoming fast friends on Capitol Hill with another fiery junior congressman, Tom Cotton. The two men bonded over “<a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/magazine/mike-pompeo-translates-trump.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/magazine/mike-pompeo-translates-trump.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investigative trips</a>” to Europe as they teamed up to oppose President Barack Obama’s push for a nuclear deal with Iran. (As Cotton told me, “He believes—as I believe—that while Iran is not a great power like Russia or China, it has the potential be an even more destabilizing power than those countries because it’s really a revolutionary cause that’s hijacked the apparatus and the powers of the state.”)</p><p>Pompeo wasn’t originally a natural choice for Trump as CIA director. The famously thin-skinned president overlooked Pompeo’s early 2016 primary backing of Marco Rubio as well as <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/pompeo-in-2016-warned-trump-would-be-an-authoritarian-president-2019-8&quot;}" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pompeo-in-2016-warned-trump-would-be-an-authoritarian-president-2019-8" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">comments</a> where Pompeo warned that Trump would be an authoritarian president. Yet Vice President-elect Pence championed Pompeo to the president-elect, and when he and Trump met the week after the election, they hit it off immediately. As Trump has <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/with-mike-pompeo-at-the-state-department-are-the-uber-hawks-winning&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/with-mike-pompeo-at-the-state-department-are-the-uber-hawks-winning" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>, “I’ve always, right from the beginning, from day one, I’ve gotten along well with Mike Pompeo.”</p><p>When Pompeo called his adopted son Nicholas in November 2016 to tell him he had been picked to be the new CIA director, the then 26-year-old thought he was joking. After all, for years over dinner table conversations Pompeo had said that his dream job would be as deputy director of the CIA, the intelligence agency’s second in command. “Dad, you overshot,” Nicholas teased, when he heard his dad had gotten the top spy post instead.</p><p>Confirmed to head the spy agency just three days after the inauguration, Pompeo began in the Trump administration delivering the President’s Daily Brief, the highly classified Oval Office intelligence report. Until the mid-2000s that task had traditionally belonged to the CIA director, but starting in 2005 the responsibility was handed over to the newly created post of the Director of National Intelligence. Yet when former Indiana senator Dan Coats became DNI, Pompeo didn’t yield the PDB and continued accompanying Coats to the Oval Office—seeming to understand that in the daily circus of the West Wing, such face time with the president was the coin of the realm.</p></div></div></div></div>
