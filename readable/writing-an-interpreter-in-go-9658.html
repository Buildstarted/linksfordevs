      <h4 id="why-this-book">Why this book?</h4>

<p>This is the book I wanted to have a year ago. This is the book I couldn't find.
<strong>I wrote this book for you and me</strong>.</p>

<p>So why should you buy it? What's different about it, compared to other
interpreter or compiler literature?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Working code is the focus</strong>. Code is not just found in the appendix. Code is
the main focus of this book.</li>
  <li><strong>It's small!</strong> It has around <strong>200 pages</strong> of which a great deal is
readable, syntax-highlighted, working code.</li>
  <li>The code presented in the book is <strong>easy to understand, easy to extend, easy
to maintain.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>No 3rd party libraries!</strong> You're not left wondering: "But how does tool X do
that?" We won't use a tool X. We only use the Go standard library and write
everything ourselves.</li>
  <li><strong>Tests!</strong> The interpreter we build in the book is <strong>fully tested!</strong> Sometimes
in TDD style, sometimes with the tests written after. You can easily run the
tests to experiment with the interpreter and make changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this book we'll create an interpreter for the Monkey programming language.
Monkey is a language especially designed for this book. <strong>We will bring it to
life by implementing its interpreter</strong>.</p>

<p>Monkey looks like this:</p>

<pre><code><span>// Bind values to names with let-statements</span>
<span>let</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Monkey programming language"</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>myArray</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>];</span>
<span>let</span> <span>coolBooleanLiteral</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use expressions to produce values</span>
<span>let</span> <span>awesomeValue</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>10</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>5</span> <span>+</span> <span>30</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>arrayWithValues</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>];</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Monkey also supports function literals and we can use them to bind a function to
a name:</p>

<pre><code><span>// Define a `fibonacci` function</span>
<span>let</span> <span>fibonacci</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>0</span>                <span>// Monkey supports implicit returning of values</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>      <span>// ... and explicit return statements</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span> <span>// Recursion! Yay!</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The data types we're going to support in this book are booleans, strings, hashes,
integers and arrays. We can combine them!</p>

<pre><code><span>// Here is an array containing two hashes, that use strings as keys and integers</span>
<span>// and strings as values</span>
<span>let</span> <span>people</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Anna"</span><span>,</span> <span>"age"</span><span>:</span> <span>24</span><span>},</span> <span>{</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Bob"</span><span>,</span> <span>"age"</span><span>:</span> <span>99</span><span>}];</span>

<span>// Getting elements out of the data types is also supported.</span>
<span>// Here is how we can access array elements by using index expressions:</span>
<span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>myArray</span><span>[</span><span>4</span><span>]);</span>
<span>// =&gt; 5</span>

<span>// We can also access hash elements with index expressions:</span>
<span>let</span> <span>getName</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>person</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>person</span><span>[</span><span>"name"</span><span>];</span> <span>};</span>

<span>// And here we access array elements and call a function with the element as</span>
<span>// argument:</span>
<span>getName</span><span>(</span><span>people</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span> <span>// =&gt; "Anna"</span>
<span>getName</span><span>(</span><span>people</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]);</span> <span>// =&gt; "Bob"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>That's not all though. Monkey has a few tricks up its sleeve. In Monkey
functions are first-class citizens, they are treated like any other value. Thus
we can use higher-order functions and pass functions around as values:</p>

<pre><code><span>// Define the higher-order function `map`, that calls the given function `f`</span>
<span>// on each element in `arr` and returns an array of the produced values.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>map</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>iter</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>,</span> <span>accumulated</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>accumulated</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>iter</span><span>(</span><span>rest</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>),</span> <span>push</span><span>(</span><span>accumulated</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>first</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>))));</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>};</span>

  <span>iter</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>,</span> <span>[]);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>// Now let's take the `people` array and the `getName` function from above and</span>
<span>// use them with `map`.</span>
<span>map</span><span>(</span><span>people</span><span>,</span> <span>getName</span><span>);</span> <span>// =&gt; ["Anna", "Bob"]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And, of course, Monkey also supports closures:</p>

<pre><code><span>// newGreeter returns a new function, that greets a `name` with the given</span>
<span>// `greeting`.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>newGreeter</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>greeting</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// `puts` is a built-in function we add to the interpreter</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>greeting</span> <span>+</span> <span>" "</span> <span>+</span> <span>name</span><span>);</span> <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>// `hello` is a greeter function that says "Hello"</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hello</span> <span>=</span> <span>newGreeter</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Calling it outputs the greeting:</span>
<span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>"dear, future Reader!"</span><span>);</span> <span>// =&gt; Hello dear, future Reader!</span>
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Yes! All of this works with the interpreter we build in the book!</strong></p>

<p>So, to summarize: Monkey has a C-like syntax, supports <strong>variable bindings</strong>,
<strong>prefix</strong> and <strong>infix</strong> operators, has <strong>first-class and higher-order
functions</strong>, can handle <strong>closures</strong> with ease and has <strong>integers</strong>,
<strong>booleans</strong>, <strong>arrays</strong> and <strong>hashes</strong> built-in.</p>

  "Compilers was the most surprisingly useful university course I ever took.
  Learning to write a parser and runtime for a toy language helps take away a
  lot of "magic" in various parts of computer science. I recommend any engineer
  who isn't familiar with lexers, parsers, and evaluators to read Thorsten's
  book."

  "This book is not only educational, but the code quality is incredible, which
  allows the reader to move seamlessly from chapter to chapter without the need
  to scratch their head over what the code means or how it works. It is cleanly
  separated, well optimized, highly readable, and very precise in its
  functionality. Because of this, it provides an excellent example for both
  novices and veterans of the Go programming language, and will serve readers
  beyond a purely intellectual understanding of programming language design and
  functionality; the code used in the book will also provide a solid foundation
  in Go programming that can be practically applied right away. This balance is
  tough to achieve, and made the book a joy to read."

  "Thorsten's writing style is fun and easy to understand with detailed

    Rust</a>, translating the example Go code into Rust as I read through. Lexers,
  parsers, and interpreters are such a fundamental part of CS, these skills are
  valuable to more than just programmers implementing programming languages. As
  a project for picking up a new language, this book is perfect because it only
  requires the standard library and has extensive test driven development,
  which means you get quick feedback as you go along. I highly recommend it for
  programmers wanting to learn more about lexers, parsers, and interpreters or
  Go programmers picking up a new language looking for a project to learn
  through."

  <li><strong>Writing An Interpreter In Go</strong> and <a href="https://compilerbook.com/">Writing A Compiler In Go</a> in one package for a <strong>reduced bundle price</strong>!</li>
  <li>Both books in <strong>ePub (iBook), Mobi (Kindle), PDF and HTML</strong>.</li>
  <li>The complete code presented in both books, including the Monkey
interpreter from <em>Writing An Interpreter In Go</em> and the <strong>Monkey bytecode
compiler and virtual machine</strong> from <a href="https://compilerbook.com/">Writing A Compiler In Go</a>.</li>
</ul>

        <h4 id="faq">FAQ</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do I need previous experience with interpreters or compilers?</strong></p>

    <p>Absolutely not! On the contrary, this book was written for you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Can I read the book even though I'm not a Go programmer?</strong></p>

    <p>Yes! I wrote the book with the aim to keep the code as easy to understand as
possible. If you are experienced in other programming languages you should be
able to understand it. Take a look at the <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/sample.pdf">free
excerpt</a> - that's as advanced as the Go code gets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Can I buy a bundle of the eBook and the paperback?</strong></p>

    <p>I'm sorry to say it, but no, I cannot bundle eBooks with paperbacks. It's not
that I don't want to (I do!) but I can't. The eBooks are sold and distributed
through Gumroad, where I have a lot of influence on the process, but the
paperback editions are being printed, sold and shipped by Amazon and I don't
have many options there. I can't tell Amazon to bundle digital files with the
paperback. Sorry!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I found a typo/mistake/error in the book. What now?</strong></p>

    <p>Take a look at the <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/changelog">changelog</a> to see whether I've already fixed
it. If I haven't or you're not sure I have, please send me an email to
<strong>me&nbsp;@&nbsp;thorstenball.com</strong> â€”&nbsp;I really appreciate it!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Why isn't the book called "Writing An Interpreter In Golang"? Wouldn't that
be better for SEO?</strong></p>

    <p>Well, I always thought I could use the "Golang" somewhere on the landingpage,
maybe in the FAQ or something.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The books are too expensive for me. Can you help me out?</strong></p>

    <p>Sure, just send me a picture! I'm always fascinated by new places and love
seeing where people live, so here's my proposal.</p>

    <p>You go outside, take a picture of where you live and send it to me to
<strong>me&nbsp;@&nbsp;thorstenball.com</strong>. Tell me what you feel comfortable paying
for the book(s) and we'll make that happen.</p>

  The Lost Chapter: A Macro System For Monkey
</h4>

</a></p>

<p>More than half a year after publishing <em>Writing An Interpreter In Go</em> I decided
to write another chapter. An additional chapter that's available to everyone:
<strong>free to read online or to download as an eBook.</strong></p>

<p>It's called <em>The Lost Chapter: A Macro System For Monkey</em> and can be thought of
as the fifth chapter for <em>Writing An Interpreter In Go</em>. It builds directly
upon the previous four and extends the Monkey interpreter as it stands at the
end of the book.</p>

<p>In the chapter we add a fully-working Lisp-style macro system to Monkey, that's
close to the way Elixir's macro system works. It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code><span>let</span> <span>unless</span> <span>=</span> <span>macro</span><span>(</span><span>condition</span><span>,</span> <span>consequence</span><span>,</span> <span>alternative</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>quote</span><span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>unquote</span><span>(</span><span>condition</span><span>)))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>unquote</span><span>(</span><span>consequence</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>unquote</span><span>(</span><span>alternative</span><span>);</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>unless</span><span>(</span><span>10</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"not greater"</span><span>),</span> <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"greater"</span><span>));</span>
<span>// outputs only: "greater"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Building your own programming language is likely not something you do in your
day job. But adding a fully working macro system? Well, that's not just
unlikely, but <strong>outright bizarre and, oh, so much fun!</strong> Macros are code that
writes code. Can you imagine how much fun it is to write code that allows us to
write code that writes code? Exactly!</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Thorsten Ball. I'm a programmer living in Germany. My whole
professional life as a software developer I've been working with web
technologies and have deployed Ruby, JavaScript, Go and even C code to
production systems.</p>

<p>Maybe you've read one of my blog posts. Some of them are pretty popular. There's
the one about <a href="http://thorstenball.com/blog/2014/03/12/watching-understanding-ruby-2.1-garbage-collector/">the Ruby Garbage
Collector</a>.
And the one about <a href="http://thorstenball.com/blog/2014/06/13/where-did-fork-go/">the fork system
call</a>. If you
haven't read one of them, then maybe the one about <a href="http://thorstenball.com/blog/2014/10/13/why-threads-cant-fork/">forking processes in a
multi-threaded
environment</a>.</p>

<p>I also give <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGhlQomeqKc">talks about Unix
software</a> and other topics. And I
turned one talk into a <a href="http://thorstenball.com/blog/2014/11/20/unicorn-unix-magic-tricks/">blog
post</a> which
got super popular and remains my favorite.</p>

<p>Writing an interpreter from scratch in Go has been one of the most enjoyable
and fun things I ever did as a programmer. So I hope you enjoy this book as
much as I enjoyed writing it.</p>
