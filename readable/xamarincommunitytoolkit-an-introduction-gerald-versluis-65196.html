<p>Today I can proudly introduce to you the XamarinCommunityToolkit package! In this post you will read all about this package (also known as <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinCommunityToolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XamarinCommunityToolkit</a>). What it does, my vision for it and how you can use it, today!</p>



<p>—</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE!!!1!!1!1!</strong>; once again naming has proven to be hard. Despite our best intensions, it seems that we cannot use the Microsoft.Toolkit.* prefix. We’re very sorry this happened and are working to resolve this. This will mean, we need to pick something different. If you have any good suggestions for a good name/namespace, make sure to tweet it at me!</p>



<p>I have unlisted the NuGet package mentioned here and we will have on up ASAP. In the meantime you can use our nightly feed mentioned below.</p>



<p>Thanks and sorry for any inconvenience anyone</p>



<p>—</p>



<h2>A Bit of History</h2>



<p>Actually, to be honest, I am not sure of the entire history. I see that the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinCommunityToolkit/commit/2bc0cce3b7da50d3ac5ac1e12a194ba9c3d24854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first commit</a> is from December 22nd 2016 by our best friend in the entire world; James <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://montemagno.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Montemagno</a>. Probably as a Xamarin.Forms counterpart to the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Community Toolkit</a>, which has been around for a while and has some impressive development.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems the XamarinCommunityToolkit has not seen much action and faded away quickly. Recently though, we were asked if we maybe wanted to revive this great initiative. Who “we” are is something I will get to in a second. And the answer was an unmistakable: of course!</p>



<p>In the past month or so we have been working hard to cleanup the repository, make an inventory of what we want to add in here, start with a fresh code base and most importantly: get our infrastructure up to be able to push NuGet packages as fast as possible.</p>



<p>As a part of all this and with the eye on Xamarin.Forms transforming into .NET MAUI, we also did a little name change to Microsoft.Toolkit.Xamarin.Forms. This will align us more with the Windows toolkit, as well as give us the possibility to evolve together with Forms when time comes.</p>



<h2>The Vision for the XamarinCommunityToolkit</h2>



<p>I don’t know if this is <em>the</em> vision, I know it’s mine. What I want out of this package is a couple of things.</p>



<ul><li>Low threshold project where everyone should feel welcome to contribute</li><li>Core team that is willing and able to help you with the above</li><li>Aggregate much used code (converters, animations, behaviors, effects, and even controls) that users copy &amp; paste/reinvent over and over again</li><li>Provide a nursery for controls and other concepts to prove themselves and maybe be upgraded to Forms/.NET MAUI from there</li><li>Provide a single library (not necessarily a single binary) under the Microsoft name to ease your compliance needs</li><li>Have fun &amp; learn!</li></ul>



<h3>Who is Driving This?</h3>



<p>The answer to that is basically: YOU!</p>



<p>This package is all about community. We would love to see our (already supporting and great) community contribute to this with all the code that you want to share with us. And of course not stop there, we also have a spot on the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/xamarin-communitytoolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Docs</a> that needs some filing, help us by doing reviews, creating issues with detailed specs of what you’d like to see, etc.</p>



<p>But as you might understand it comes in handy to have a couple of core people that can help move things along and keep their eye on it. That is why we have a core team that consists of mostly community members, and a couple of Microsoft employees that have some rights in the right systems.</p>



<h4>Core Team</h4>



<p>If you have been using Xamarin.Forms, I think there will be a couple of names that sound familiar.</p>



<ul><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/Andrik_Just4Fun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrei Misiukevich</a></li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://xamgirl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlin Agramonte</a></li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://depblog.weblogs.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glenn Versweyveld</a></li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sharpnado.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jean-Marie Alfonsi</a></li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://thewissen.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steven Thewissen</a></li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/jsuarezruiz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Javier Suárez</a> (Microsoft, Xamarin.Forms team)</li><li>Me! (Microsoft)</li></ul>



<p>These fine people are all here to keep an eye on things. If you want to reach out to us, you can use the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://aka.ms/dotnet-discord" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DotNetEvolution Discord</a>. We are in the <code>xamarin-community-toolkit</code> channel. We of course also have a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinCommunityToolkit/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">code of conduct</a> in place. If you find anything not in order to that regard, please feel free to reach out to any of us in private, we are all glad to help and address your concerns.</p>



<h2>What’s in the XamarinCommunityToolkit Box?!</h2>



<p><s>I am writing this post because we have just released version 1.0.0-pre1</s> (see update at the top). Because we are still setting up, I don’t have any formal release notes or anything yet, but this is what we have in this pre-release right now:</p>



<h3>Behaviors</h3>



<p>A whole bunch of behaviors!</p>



<ul><li>Email validation</li><li>Event to Command (!!)</li><li>Numeric validation</li><li>Text validation</li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://xamgirl.com/plug-and-play-animations-in-xamarin-forms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animations</a></li></ul>



<h3>Controls</h3>



<ul><li>RangeSlider</li><li>AvatarView</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ezgif.com-optimize-2.gif" alt="Screen capture of the AvatarView on iOS Simulator in Microsoft.Toolkit.Xamarin.Forms"><figcaption>AvatarView in action</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Converters</h3>



<p>Need another shape or form? You’ve come to the right place</p>



<ul><li>BoolToObject</li><li>DoubleToInt</li><li>Equal</li><li>IndexToArray</li><li>IntToBool</li><li>InvertedBool</li><li>IsNotNullOrEmpty</li><li>IsNullOrEmpty</li><li>ItemSelectedEventArgs</li><li>ItemTappedEventArgs</li><li>ListIsNotNullOrEmpty</li><li>ListIsNullOrEmpty</li><li>MultiConverter</li><li>NotEqual</li><li>TextCase</li></ul>



<h3>Effects</h3>

<p>I would say that is pretty complete already! But this is just a pre-release 🤯</p>



<h2>Get Started with XamarinCommunityToolkit Today</h2>
