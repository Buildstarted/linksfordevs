<p>First up: the Pixel 4 will supposedly have a 90Hz &quot;smooth display&quot; feature, just like the OnePlus 7 Pro. This means the entire interface should refresh at 90 frames per second instead of the usual 60, which&#x2014;on the OnePlus 7 Pro at least&#x2014;proved to be an absolute revelation for UI smoothness and making the phone feel fast and responsive.&#xA0;Until 90Hz displays came along, Google was the leader in Android UI &quot;smoothness,&quot; so it&apos;ll be interesting to see what the company can do with a faster display.</p>
<p>Quicker display refresh rates are rapidly becoming the next big upgrade for Android phones&#x2014;as evidenced by the aforementioned 90Hz OnePlus phone and even a 120Hz OLED screen from Asus with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/asus-rog-phone-ii-features-a-120hz-display-a-new-soc-and-a-giant-battery/">ROG Phone 2</a>. At the Note10 launch, we were disappointed to see Samsung shipping a regular old 60Hz display on its $1,000 flagship, and now it looks like even Google is going to beat Samsung to the punch.</p>
<p>9to5Google also lists two sizes for the Pixel 4, with 5.7-inch and 6.3-inch variants on the way. The larger version gets a 3700mAh battery, while the smaller version will supposedly have a 2800mAh battery. 2800mAh sounds pretty paltry for a 2019 smartphone, and this is actually a downgrade from the Pixel 3, which had a 2915mAh battery.</p>
<p>We should at least see one big Pixel problem fixed by a jump from 4GB to 6GB of RAM. The Pixel 3 was criticized last year for only having 4GB of RAM when other phones had 6 or 8GB, and the phone <em>did</em> end up being RAM starved for power users&#x2014;to the point that Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124250/google-pixel-3-memory-camera-patch-now-available">released an update</a> to try to tweak the phone&apos;s memory management. Six gigabytes of RAM is still not spectacular in 2019, with some phones shipping with double that amount today, but it&apos;s better than 4GB.</p>
<p>If these rumors pan out like the last ones did, the Pixel 4 is shaping up to have a rare property for a Pixel device: novel and unique hardware.&#xA0;In the past the Pixel story has been all about the software, and you would buy a Google phone&#xA0;<em>in spite</em> of the hardware. After spending time with the OnePlus 7 Pro, we think 90Hz displays should be mandatory in flagship smartphones, and for once Google is jumping on the train early, even before Samsung. Google&apos;s Project Soli radar sensor <em>is&#xA0;</em>truly unique, but Google will have to come up with a way to make it useful in a smartphone, and not just redundant when you already have a giant touchscreen in front of you.</p>
<p>That&apos;s it for this latest round of rumors. Google has been blowing up the tech news cycle lately and taking the unprecedented step of&#xA0;<i>confirming</i>&#xA0;<em>rumors</em>&#xA0;from the Internet as they pop up. So far the company has released its&#xA0;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/google-posts-the-first-official-pixel-4-image/">own phone render</a>&#xA0;after the rumor mill outed the design, and later it&#xA0;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/google-announces-the-pixel-4-will-have-faceid-radar-powered-gestures/">announced Project Soli integration</a>&#xA0;after that rumor was posted at 9to5. Let&apos;s see if Google has anything to say about this one&#x2014;Google, here&apos;s my rumor, so call me, maybe?</p> <p><em>Listing image by Google</em></p> </div>
