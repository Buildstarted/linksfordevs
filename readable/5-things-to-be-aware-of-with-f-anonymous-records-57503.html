<p>In our <a href="https://www.compositional-it.com/news-blog/5-tips-for-working-with-f-anonymous-records/">previous post</a> on Anonymous Records, we looked at some of the <em>benefits</em> of working with them. In this post, I want to discuss five "gotchas" that you should be aware of when using anonymous records that you may not have considered.</p>

<p>Unlike standard F# records, the F# compiler won't look at instances of anonymous records that have been declared, nor type aliases, when performing type inference. This normally isn't a problem when <em>returning</em> anonymous records out of e.g. a function, but when taken as an <em>input</em>, it's invariably an issue.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> foo <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span> Name <span>=</span> <span>"Isaac"</span> <span>|</span><span>}</span>


<span>let</span> bar x <span>=</span>
    x<span>.</span>Name

bar foo</code></pre>
<p>You can resolve this either by explicitly entering a type annotation, or by using a type alias:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> bar <span>(</span>x<span>:</span><span>{</span><span>|</span>Name<span>:</span>string<span>|</span><span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> x<span>.</span>Name


<span>type</span> FooData <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span> Name <span>:</span> string <span>|</span><span>}</span>
<span>let</span> bar <span>(</span>x<span>:</span>FooData<span>)</span> <span>=</span> x<span>.</span>Name</code></pre>
<p>Often the latter will be preferable to improve readability, and acts as a useful "bridge" when moving towards full records.</p>

<p>Error messages with anonymous records are different to those for standard records, and in F#4.7 are not always particularly easy to reason about.</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> FullRecord <span>=</span> <span>{</span> Name <span>:</span> string<span>;</span> Age <span>:</span> int <span>}</span>


<span>let</span> x<span>:</span>FullRecord <span>=</span> <span>{</span> Name <span>=</span> <span>"Isaac"</span> <span>}</span>

<span>type</span> AnonymousRecord <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span> Name <span>:</span> string<span>;</span> Age <span>:</span> int <span>|</span><span>}</span>


<span>let</span> y<span>:</span>AnonymousRecord <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span> Name <span>=</span> <span>"Isaac"</span> <span>|</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Observe how the former understands what record type is required and explains what field(s) are missing. The latter requires you to scan through all fields to identify the difference between both lists. If you have more than just a few fields, and more one difference, it can quickly become very, very difficult to identify what those differences are. Thankfully <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/8091">this issue</a> has been fixed and will be included in the next version of F#. Other issues still exist with error messages, such as <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/8127">this one</a> - I hope that such improvements are implemented in time.</p>

<p>You cannot pattern match on anonymous record fields, even if you use type annotations to tell the compiler which record is being used. You can work around this to some extent by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/active-patterns">Active Patterns</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>|</span>Name<span>|</span>_<span>|</span><span>)</span> v <span>(</span>x<span>:</span>AnonymousRecord<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>if</span> x<span>.</span>Name <span>=</span> v <span>then</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>else</span> None
<span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>|</span>Age<span>|</span>_<span>|</span><span>)</span> v <span>(</span>x<span>:</span>AnonymousRecord<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>if</span> x<span>.</span>Age <span>=</span> v <span>then</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>else</span> None
<span>let</span> greet <span>(</span>r<span>:</span>AnonymousRecord<span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>match</span> r <span>with</span>
    <span>|</span> Name <span>"Test"</span> <span>&amp;</span> Age <span>20</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>"Hello!"</span>
    <span>|</span> _ <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>"Goodbye"</span>

foo <span>{</span><span>|</span> Name <span>=</span> <span>"Isaac"</span><span>;</span> Age <span>=</span> <span>21</span> <span>|</span><span>}</span> 
foo <span>{</span><span>|</span> Name <span>=</span> <span>"Test"</span><span>;</span> Age <span>=</span> <span>20</span> <span>|</span><span>}</span> </code></pre>

<p>You can't put members on anonymous records. Again, there's a workaround using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/type-extensions#extension-methods">Extension Methods</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>open</span> System<span>.</span>Runtime<span>.</span>CompilerServices

<span>let</span> y<span>:</span>AnonymousRecord <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span> Name <span>=</span> <span>"Isaac"</span><span>;</span> Age <span>=</span> <span>21</span> <span>|</span><span>}</span>

<span>[</span><span>&lt;</span>Extension<span>;</span> AbstractClass<span>;</span> Sealed<span>&gt;</span><span>]</span>
<span>type</span> Extensions <span>=</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&lt;</span>Extension<span>&gt;</span><span>]</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>member</span> Description <span>(</span>ty<span>:</span> AnonymousRecord<span>)</span> <span>=</span>
        sprintf <span>"%s is %d years old"</span> ty<span>.</span>Name ty<span>.</span>Age

y<span>.</span><span>Description</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> </code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You cannot use type extensions; only extension methods are allowed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whilst anonymous records <em>appear</em> to be structural records with e.g. static duck typing and so on, they aren't - they're still nominal records that are defined statistically.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> p1 <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span> Name <span>=</span> <span>"Fred"</span> <span>|</span><span>}</span>
<span>let</span> p2 <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span> Name <span>=</span> <span>"Tim"</span> <span>|</span><span>}</span>
<span>let</span> p3 <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span> Name <span>=</span> <span>"Frank"</span><span>;</span> Age <span>=</span> <span>34</span> <span>|</span><span>}</span>
p1<span>.</span><span>GetType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> p2<span>.</span><span>GetType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> 
p1<span>.</span><span>GetType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> p3<span>.</span><span>GetType</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> </code></pre>
<p>So, whilst the compiler does support <em>some</em> nice features, be aware that there are limits. For starters, you can construct one anonymous record as a superset of another, but you can't compose more than one "source" record, and nor can you create "subset" records.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> a <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span> Fruit <span>=</span> <span>"Bananas"</span> <span>|</span><span>}</span>
<span>let</span> b <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span> Color <span>=</span> <span>"Yellow"</span> <span>|</span><span>}</span>
<span>let</span> c <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span> a <span>with</span> Climate <span>=</span> <span>"Hot"</span> <span>|</span><span>}</span> 
<span>let</span> z <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span> a <span>with</span> b <span>with</span> Age <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>|</span><span>}</span> </code></pre>
<p>You also cannot do things such as this:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> capitaliseFruit <span>(</span>x<span>:</span><span>{</span><span>|</span>Fruit<span>:</span> string<span>|</span><span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    x<span>.</span>Fruit<span>.</span><span>ToUpper</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

capitaliseFruit c </code></pre>

<p>Anonymous Records are an extremely useful tool in the arsenal of an F# developer. They provide an excellent alternative to Tuples in terms of documentation and readability, some unique features that "full" records don't have, and a smooth migration path towards full records when required.</p>
<p>However, there are definitely some limitations over full records - although these often have workarounds by using alternative language features. Often, type annotations and hints can get you quite far, although if you're continuously resorting to these atypical workarounds, I would advise considering moving to full records.</p>
