Hello Cracked.to Members,</p><p>

I wish I would have never been forced to do such a thread but that's what you get for trusting the wrong people. I will take full responsibility as it was only my fault. </p><p>

Today, <span>27.07.2019</span>, I got the message that an old person of my trust has forum backups that contains the database and folder files. Those backups could be valid from <span>End of 2018 until June 2019</span>.<br>
Since it's not longer in my hands that the database and forum files remain private, I wanted to use this thread to give everyone a warning about what <span>could</span> happen.</p><p>

The database has not been published yet. However there is a chance that it's going to happen, hence we forced every user to change his password. We are also resetting all database sessions within the next few hours.</p><p>

<span><span>Before everyone panics:</span></span></p><p>

<span>We have changed the hashing&nbsp;algorithm of passwords from mybb default (md5) to something more advanced a few months ago, which makes it almost impossible to decrypt your passwords.</span></p><p>

I'm beyond sorry that this has happened, especially for the community. </p><p>
