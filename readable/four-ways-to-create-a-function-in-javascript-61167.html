			<p><span>We'll look at the four ways of creating a function in JavaScript: as a statement, as an expression, as an arrow function, and using the Function constructor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I wish undefined was a function in JavaScript.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are four ways a function can be created in JavaScript. They are as follows: </p>
<ul>
    <li>A function as a statement </li>
    <li>A function as an expression </li>
    <li>A function as an arrow function </li>
    <li>A function created using the Function constructor </li>
</ul>
<p>All four ways of function creation have distinct features such as an arrow function that does not have its own <code>this</code> object, a function statement that is hoisted on the top of the execution context, and a function expression that can be immediately invoked without creating a separate scope. Having a good understanding of various characteristics of different types of JavaScript functions is useful to write better code. This article explains these functions. </p>
<h2 id="afunctionasastatement">A Function as a Statement</h2>
<p>A function as a statement can be created as shown the following code example:</p>

<p>A function statement starts with the function keyword. It can return a primitive type value, object, or another function. For example, a function statement can return an object as shown in the following code example:  </p>

<p>The main characteristic of a function statement is it is hoisted at the top of the execution context. Therefore, you can call a function statement before it is declared, as shown in the following code example: </p>

<p>As you see, that <code>Add</code> function is called before it is created, and this is possible because a function statement is hoisted at the top of the execution context. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A function statement is hoisted at the top of the execution context. So, it can be invoked before it is created. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a function statement, you can pass primitive values as either parameters or non-primitive values, such as an object or array. The primitive parameters are passed as a value, and the non-primitive values are passed as a reference. So, if you pass an object to a function statement and the function changes the object’s properties, that change is visible outside the function, as shown in the following code example:</p>

<p>In the above code, JavaScript updates the <code>Title</code> of the product object. However, if you pass a string, number, or Boolean parameters in the function, it won’t be reflected globally. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a function statement, primitive parameters are <strong>passed as a value</strong>, and non-primitive parameters such as objects and arrays are <strong>passed as a reference</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="afunctionasanexpression">A Function as an Expression</h2>
<p>A function as an expression can be created as shown in the following code example. </p>

<p>In a function expression, you assign a function to a variable. A function expression can also be created as anonymous without a name, as shown in the following code example: </p>

<p>The name of the function expression is local to the function body and very useful for recursions or any scenario in which you need to refer to the function inside the function body. You can write a factorial function by using function expression name: </p>

<p>The main differences between a function statement and a function expression are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>A function expression can be created without a name, whereas a function statement must have a name</li>
    <li>A function expression is not hoisted on the top of the execution context, whereas a function statement is hoisted at the top of the execution context</li>
</ul>
<p>Since a function expression is not hoisted at the top of the execution context, calling the function before it is created throws <strong>ReferenceError</strong>, as shown in the following code example: </p>

<p>So, you can summarize the hoisting difference as: </p>
<ul>
    <li>A function statement is hoisted at the top of the execution context, so it can be invoked before it is created</li>
    <li>A function expression is not hoisted at the top of the execution context, so it cannot be invoked before it is created</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A function expression is not hoisted at the top of the execution context. So, it cannot be invoked before it is created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One other important feature of a function expression is that it can be immediately invoked as soon as it is defined, which is also known as&nbsp;<strong>Immediately Invoked Function Expression</strong>:</p>

<p>On the other hand, a function statement cannot be immediately invoked as soon as it is defined without creating a separate scope, as shown in the following code example. </p>

<h2 id="anarrowfunction">An Arrow Function</h2>
<p>The arrow functions were introduced in ECMA 2015 with the main purpose of giving a shorter syntax to a function expression. Besides providing shorter syntax, which increases the readability of the code, it does not have its own value of the <code>this</code> object. The value of <code>this</code> object inside an arrow function is inherited from the enclosing scope.
</p>
<p>You can write an arrow function to add two numbers as shown in the next code example.</p>

<p>Some syntax rules for an arrow function are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Parameters should be passed in a small bracket</li>
    <li>If there is only one parameter, then the bracket is optional</li>
    <li>If there is no parameter, then it must have a small empty bracket</li>
    <li>If there is only a single expression in the function body, then using parentheses is optional</li>
    <li>If there is only a single expression in the function body, then using the return statement is optional</li>
</ul>
<p>    You can apply the above syntax rules to create arrow functions, as shown in the following code example.</p>

<p>To return an object from an arrow function, you can either use a return statement or a slightly different syntax of enclosing the object in a small bracket, as shown in the following example:</p>

<p>Some other important features of an arrow function are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>It supports the rest parameters </li>
    <li>It supports the default parameters </li>
    <li>It does not have arguments object </li>
    <li>It does not have its own <code>this</code> object </li>
    <li>It cannot be used as a constructor</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of <code>this</code> object inside an arrow function is inherited from the enclosing scope.  To understand it in a better way, consider the following code example:</p>

<p>The function <code>foo</code> is called indirectly using the <code>call()</code> method to pass the <code>Product</code> object as the value of <code>this</code> inside it. And since the function <code>koo</code> is called using the function invocation pattern, the value of <code>this</code> object for it is the global object. So, even though <code>koo</code> is an internal function of <code>foo</code>, it has its own value of <code>this</code> object.</p>
<p>But, if you refactor the <code>koo</code> function as an arrow function, then instead of having its own <code>this</code> object, it inherits it from the enclosing scope, as shown in the next code example.</p>

<p>The other restriction on arrow functions is that they cannot be used as constructors, so the following code example throws an exception. </p>

<h2 id="usingfunctionconstructor">Using Function Constructor</h2>
<p>A function can be dynamically created using the Function constructor, but it suffers from security and performance issues and is not advisable to use.
</p>
<p>You can create a function using the Function constructor as shown in the following example.</p>

<p>In the <code>Function</code> constructor, you pass parameters and function body as a string. The function created with the Function constructor is always created in the global scope. </p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this article you learned about various ways of creating a function and their characteristics – for example, a function statement is hoisted at the top of the execution context, a function expression is not hoisted and can be created without a name, and an arrow function does not have its own <code>this</code> object.</p>
<p>
I hope you found the article useful. Thanks for reading. </p>
