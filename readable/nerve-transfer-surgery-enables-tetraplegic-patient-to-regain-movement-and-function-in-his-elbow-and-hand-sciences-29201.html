As a recently graduated physical therapist this intrigues me so much...I have only really worked with a handful of SCI patients. With one of my rotations I spent nearly two weeks with young lady suffered from tetraplegia and is was heartbreaking that really the only thing I could do was some passive range of motion and pressure relief.</p><p>In school we were always taught to be carefully honest in how we responded to patients asking us about their potential to return to their previous lifestyles again. It’s exciting to see that “the future research out there” is starting to make some progress.</p></div></div></div></div>
