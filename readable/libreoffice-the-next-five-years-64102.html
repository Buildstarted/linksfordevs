The <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> project would
seem to be on a roll.  It produces what is widely seen as the leading
free office-productivity suite, and has managed to move out of the shadow
of the moribund (but brand-recognized) <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/729460/">Apache
OpenOffice</a> project.  The 
LibreOffice&nbsp;7 release is coming within a month, and the tenth
anniversary of the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/407339/">founding</a> of the <a href="https://www.documentfoundation.org/">Document Foundation</a> arrives in
September.  Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-online/">LibreOffice
Online</a> is taking off and, seemingly, seeing some market success.
So it is a bit surprising to see the project's core developers
in a sort of crisis mode while users worry about a tag that showed up in
the project's repository.
</p><p>

LibreOffice was based on firm free-software principles, and is an
egalitarian organization overall, so it is not surprising that the
appearance of a "Personal Edition" tag in a recent 7.0 release candidate
raised some eyebrows.  Company-dominated projects will often withhold
features for "enterprise" customers, delaying their arrival into the
second-class "community edition" or keeping them entirely proprietary.  But
LibreOffice is not supposed to be such a project; it is owned by an
independent foundation and its development is driven by a few companies.
LibreOffice is freely shared by everybody, or at least it has been so far.
</p><p>

The fuss quickly reached a level that required the Document Foundation's
board to <a href="https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2020/07/06/board-statement-on-the-libreoffice-7-0rc-personal-edition-label/">issue a statement</a> about what was
going on.  The board emphasized that there will be no license change for
LibreOffice, and no changes to "<span>the license, the availability, the
permitted uses and/or the functionalities</span>".  But there is still
something going on:
</p><p>
	 This "Personal Edition" tag line is part of a wider 5 years
	 marketing plan we are preparing and it has the purpose of
	 differentiating the current, free and community supported
	 LibreOffice from a LibreOffice Enterprise set of products and
	 services provided by the members of our ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
So, while nothing is going to change, there is still a plan to create
different versions of LibreOffice, some of which will need to be paid for.
</p><h4>Some problems</h4>
<p>
The driving force behind the changes is easy enough to understand; it is
one that many successful free-software projects face.  LibreOffice is a
huge program, and developing it takes a lot of work.  According to <a href="https://nextcloud.documentfoundation.org/s/jzryGw7XDkJadmo#pdfviewer">this
marketing plan [PDF]</a> put together by the project, nearly 70% of the
changes to LibreOffice come from developers paid by "ecosystem companies";
those companies pay about 40&nbsp;people to work on LibreOffice.  That is
not a small expense; the companies involved will only be able to sustain
that level of development if LibreOffice is bringing in a corresponding
amount of revenue.
</p><p>

In a lengthy post titled "<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/825602/">Some problems</a>",
project co-founder Michael Meeks explained that this revenue is <i>not</i>
coming in.  Part of the problem is that
Microsoft provides "<span>poor to non-existent support to the
majority of users</span>" of Office, he said, so nobody thinks in terms of
buying support for any office suite:

</p><p>
	It is routinely the case that I meet organizations that have
	deployed free LibreOffice without long term support, with no
	security updates etc. Try the Cabinet Office in the UK (at the
	center of UK Government), or a large European Gov't Department I
	recently visited - 15,000 seats - with some great FLOSS enthusiasm,
	but simply no conceptual frame that deploying un-supported FLOSS in
	the enterprise hurts the software that they then rely on.
</p>
<p>
Companies think of LibreOffice, he said, in the same way that they think
about web browsers, which are available for free and are well supported.
But work on web browsers is paid for by advertising, which is not a model
that works for an office suite.
</p><p>
The problem is compounded by companies that sell inexpensive "support" for
LibreOffice, but which are not involved in its development and are not
really able to provide that support.  Those companies "<span>file all their
tickets up-stream and hope they are fixed for free</span>".  Companies
working in that mode have no problem pricing their offerings below those of
the companies doing the actual work (and thus winning much of the business
that does exist).  In addition, they simply call their
offerings "LibreOffice", which actually looks <i>more</i> authentic than
services from other companies, which are trying to build their own brands
around LibreOffice support.
</p><p>
LibreOffice, he concluded, has tried to do something unique and is finding
its path to be difficult:
</p><p>
	As we look around the industry we see tons of organizations
	exploring ways to solve similar problems. LibreOffice's is
	‑particularly‑ challenging, because we aspire to being a vendor
	neutral project. There are reasonably well-known ways to build a
	company controlled, branded, FLOSS project - we know and love lots
	of them: openSUSE, Fedora, Nextcloud, ownCloud etc. this is the
	norm. With TDF we tried to do something far harder - to create an
	vendor neutral ecosystem that can help retain the community spirit
	while delivering on our mission. That has proved extraordinarily
	harder.
</p>
<p>
The result of all this is that the LibreOffice ecosystem "<span>is under
long term stress</span>".
</p><h4>The plan</h4>
<p>
In response to these problems, members of the LibreOffice community have
been working on a five-year marketing plan, the core of which can be seen
in the slides linked above.  The intent is to create differentiated
versions of LibreOffice while avoiding open-core or proprietary business
models.  Part of that involves getting a better handle on the LibreOffice
brand.
</p><p>
The plan starts by creating the concept of the "LibreOffice Engine", which
is a term to describe the core LibreOffice code.  It is meant to be a way
to enable products selling under their own brand to associate themselves
with LibreOffice while maintaining their own identity.  "LibreOffice
Engine" is described in the plan as a sort of equivalent to the highly
successful "Intel Inside" branding effort.  Presumably this term would be
trademarked by the Document Foundation; the plan does not get into what
constraints would be put on who could use the trademark (and how).
</p><p>
Then, there is the Personal Edition, which would be "<span>forever
free</span>" and only available from the Document Foundation.  This release
would be tagged, according to the plan, "<span>volunteer supported, not
suggested for production environments or strategic documents</span>".  The
alternative would be "LibreOffice Enterprise", which would only be
available from "ecosystem members".  This version would come with
commercial support and a corresponding price tag.
</p><p>
LibreOffice Online seems to be a place where a lot of tension resides,
perhaps unsurprisingly, since that is where the bulk of the money is being
made with LibreOffice now.  Companies would like to keep parts of
LibreOffice Online to themselves, but that threatens to disrupt the
volunteer part of the development community.  The plan involves the same
split between "personal" and "enterprise" offerings, but adds a little
note: "<span>There will be an X month gap between the release of the two
versions: LibreOffice Online Enterprise and LibreOffice Online
Personal</span>".
</p><p>
The hope is that this plan will give the true "ecosystem members" something
attractive to sell and, to an extent, free them from the difficult
challenge of competing with the free LibreOffice offering.  It is, in many
ways, reminiscent of the path Red Hat took years ago to differentiate its
Enterprise Linux offering, complete with insinuations that the free version
might not be fully trustworthy.  That approach has clearly worked well for
Red Hat; it would be hard to argue that it has not worked well for the
wider Linux community too.
</p><p>
Free software is an inherently challenging base upon which to try to build
a company.  Many in the free-software community are happily indifferent to
the fate of companies working with the code, but without successful
companies we would not have much of the code that we depend on every day.
As Meeks pointed out, LibreOffice without companies would look a lot like
the cobweb-strewn OpenOffice project; it is hard to see that as a win for
anybody.  So one can only wish LibreOffice and the Document Foundation luck
as they seek a way to solve this problem while remaining true to the
free-software principles that sparked the project's launch in the first
place.  Ten years of LibreOffice is nowhere near enough.<br clear="all"></p>
