In response, the exchange emailed all potentially impacted users and informed them of a forced password reset on their accounts.&#xA0;</span></p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">&quot;Earlier this week we emailed a small group of our customers (about 1% of our total base), requiring them to reset their Poloniex password in response to a tweet claiming to contain a list of leaked email addresses and passwords,&quot; the exchange <a href="https://medium.com/poloniex/addressing-our-december-29-2019-password-reset-email-f384b4952549">said in its statement</a>. &quot;To confirm, there was no information or data leak originating from Poloniex and our actions represented a swift response to an external threat.&quot;</p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text"><span>In its new statement, Poloniex said that &quot;our investigation has concluded that approximately 90% of the passwords listed already appear in the haveibeenpwned.com list of exploited passwords. Additionally, our security team is in touch with haveibeenpwned.com and has requested that they update their database to include additional missing information we have identified.&quot;</span></p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text"><span>Poloniex emphasized that it does not store user&apos; passwords in plain text or any recoverable form. Rather, it stores them as salted bcrypt hashes.</span></p><p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" type="text">Additionally, Poloniex stated that &quot;[l]ess than 5% of the email addresses on the posted list were associated with Poloniex accounts.&quot;</p></div>
