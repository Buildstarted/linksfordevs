					<p>Hey Folks!</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce some changes to the way we release new builds to all Windows Insiders.</p>
<p>We are transitioning and converting our current <strong>ring model</strong>, based on the <strong>frequency</strong> of builds, to a new <strong>channel model</strong> that pivots on the <strong>quality</strong> of builds and better supports <strong>parallel</strong> coding efforts. In addition to this change, Insiders will also find similar offering names and expectations across <strong>Windows and Office programs and soon Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Teams</strong>. Our goal is to not only make it clearer for existing Insiders to choose the experience that’s right for them, but also for new Insiders to pick the right channel as they join. The Insider community is very important to us all and we’re working to align how all our Insider programs work better together across Microsoft.</p>
<p>Read on to learn more about channels, why we’re making the change, and what existing Insiders need to do to be prepared. (Spoiler: Nothing. We got you covered!)</p>

<p>When we first began flighting new Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2014/10/21/were-rolling-out-our-first-new-build-to-the-windows-insider-program/">over 5 years ago</a>, Windows Insiders were asked to join one of two rings based on the frequency of when new builds would be delivered to their device—“Fast” or “Slow.” Insiders who wanted updates the fastest and were comfortable with some rough edges joined the Fast ring. Insiders who would rather wait for more polished and stable updates joined the Slow ring. And, in early 2016, we introduced the Release Preview ring for Insiders who wanted to receive early access to servicing updates on released versions of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Over the years, we’ve adjusted how we’ve used the rings as we have evolved the way we build and release Windows 10. Originally, we flighted builds from a single product release. Now, we’re innovating on features in multiple product releases at the same time. In the middle of 2019, Insiders were running builds from 3 different releases (at various stages in our development cycle) with the Fast ring being on 20H1, the Slow ring on 19H2 code, and the Release Preview ring on 19H1 code. We began to realize that we were “outgrowing” the original concept for rings.</p>
<p>As we continue to evolve the way we release Windows 10 and the diversity of Insiders we serve is greater than ever, it is critical that Insiders have a flighting option that is tailored to their needs. <strong>We believe the best way to do this is to shift focus from frequency to quality. </strong>Insiders can pick a channel that represents the experience they want for their device based on the quality they are most comfortable with. Our intention is to ensure Insiders will continue to receive frequent updates no matter which channel they’ve chosen.</p>

<p>Later this month, the <strong>Fast</strong> ring will become the <strong>Dev Channel</strong>, the <strong>Slow</strong> ring will become the <strong>Beta Channel</strong>, and the <strong>Release Preview</strong> ring will become the <strong>Release Preview Channel</strong>. Here is what that mapping looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/06/be63c233f03586473dc5a970f53d284d.png"><img src="https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/06/be63c233f03586473dc5a970f53d284d.png" alt="Table for mapping the new Channels: Fast ring will become the Dev Channel, the Slow ring will become the Beta Channel, and the Release Preview ring will become the Release Preview Channel." width="703" height="506" srcset="https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/06/be63c233f03586473dc5a970f53d284d.png 1281w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/06/be63c233f03586473dc5a970f53d284d-300x216.png 300w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/06/be63c233f03586473dc5a970f53d284d-1024x737.png 1024w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/06/be63c233f03586473dc5a970f53d284d-768x553.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px"></a></p>
<h2><strong>Dev Channel</strong></h2>
<p>Ideal for highly technical users. Insiders in the Dev Channel will receive builds that is earliest in a development cycle and will contain the latest work-in-progress code from our engineers. These builds will have rough edges and some instability that could block key activities or require workarounds.</p>
<p>These builds are not matched to a specific Windows 10 release. New features and OS improvements in this channel will show up in future Windows 10 releases when they’re ready and may be delivered as full OS build updates or servicing releases. Insider feedback here will help our engineers with major fixes and changes to the latest code.</p>
<h2><strong>Beta Channel </strong></h2>
<p>Ideal for early adopters. Insiders and IT Professionals in the Beta Channel can check out upcoming Windows 10 features, while still getting relatively reliable updates that are validated by Microsoft.</p>
<p>As a part of the Beta Channel, Insiders will see builds that will be tied to a specific upcoming release, like 20H1 previously. Your feedback will be especially important here, since it will help our engineers make sure that key issues are identified and fixed before a major release.</p>
<h2><strong>Release Preview Channel</strong></h2>
<p>Insiders and IT Professionals in the Release Preview Channel will have access to the upcoming release of Windows 10 prior to it being released to the world, with advanced quality updates and certain key features. These builds are supported by Microsoft. The Release Preview Channel is where we recommend companies preview and validate upcoming Windows 10 releases before broad deployment within their organization.</p>
<p>As we continue to evolve the way we’re building and releasing Windows 10 in the future, we may introduce new channels for new experiences for Insiders.</p>

<p>We are extremely excited to be aligning with Office, where <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/office-365-blog/a-new-wave-of-innovation-to-help-it-modernize-servicing-of/ba-p/1380733">new channel names were recently announced</a>. An Insider can make a choice as to which experience, they want and have it mean the same thing between Windows and Office. Insiders still need to opt into each Insider Program separately, but we are looking to improve this experience over time.</p>

<p>Moving to channels is another step in bringing the Windows and Office Insider Programs even closer together!</p>

<p>For Windows Insiders, the move to channels will be easy. If your device is currently flighting, we’ll <strong>automatically move your devices</strong> based on your current ring to the new channel that best corresponds with that experience. You won’t have to take any action for this change to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Fast ring = Dev Channel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slow ring = Beta Channel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Release Preview ring = Release Preview Channel</strong></p>
<p>Insiders can always adjust these settings by going to <a href="https://aka.ms/WIPSettings">Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Insider Program</a> if they want to change channels and try out new experiences.</p>
<p>IT Professionals can manage the Beta and Release Preview Channel builds using their typical Windows Update for Business or Windows Server Update Service management tool, or through the use of Azure Marketplace virtual machines (VMs).</p>
<p>And if you’re not yet flighting, give it a try! Get started by going to <a href="https://aka.ms/WIPSettings">Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Insider Program</a> and choosing with the channel/experience that best suits your needs. <strong>The transition to channels will start showing up on the Windows Insider Program’s Settings page in builds later this month.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for helping us grow and evolving with us as we make this move from rings to channels. As always, feel free to share with us your thoughts or questions <a href="https://twitter.com/windowsinsider">by tweeting at us</a> or submitting feedback in Feedback Hub.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
