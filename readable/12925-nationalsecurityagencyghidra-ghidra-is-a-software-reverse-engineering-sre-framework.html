This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Capabilities include disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along with hundreds of other features. Ghidra supports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and executable formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes. Users may also develop their own Ghidra plug-in components and/or scripts using Java or Python.</p><p>In support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve scaling and teaming problems on complex SRE efforts, and to provide a customizable and extensible SRE research platform. NSA has applied Ghidra SRE capabilities to a variety of problems that involve analyzing malicious code and generating deep insights for SRE analysts who seek a better understanding of potential vulnerabilities in networks and systems.</p><p>To start developing extensions and scripts, try out the GhidraDev plugin for Eclipse, which is part of the distribution package.  The full release build can be downloaded from our <a href="https://www.ghidra-sre.org/" rel="nofollow">project homepage</a>.</p><p>This repository contains the source for the core framework, features, and extensions.
If you would like to contribute, please take a look at our <a href="/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributor guide</a> to see how you can participate in this open source project.</p><p>If you are a U.S. citizen interested in projects like this, to develop Ghidra, and
other cybersecurity tools, for NSA to help protect our nation and its allies,
