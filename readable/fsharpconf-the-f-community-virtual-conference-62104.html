    <h2>Announcing our first speakers!</h2>
    <p>
      This one-day virtual event will feature more than 8 hours of talks. You can find the
      list of early confirmed speakers below. They will be covering a wide range of topics
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Getting started</strong> with F# for the .NET, mobile and the web.</li>
      <li><strong>Functional architecture</strong> on both the client and the server</li>

      <li><strong>Beyond the basics</strong> - solving hard problems with F#</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We're working on finalizing the agenda and we'll share it soon. Do you have a talk idea
      or a topic suggestion? Tweet us at <a href="https://twitter.com/fsharponline">@fsharponline</a>,
      or contact any of <a href="#org">the organizers</a>.

    <h2>About F# and fsharpConf</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.fsharp.org/"><img id="fsharp-logo" alt="F# Software Foundation" src="http://fsharpconf.com/design/logo.png"></a>
    </p>

    <p>F# is an open-source, cross-platform, functional first programming language. F# makes it
      easy to solve complex problems with simple code. It integrates smoothly with existing
      .NET code bases. And... it makes coding fun again! </p>

    <p>F# has an active open-source community building on a wide range of tools for web programming,
      data analytics, testing, cloud computing and much more. At <strong>fsharpConf</strong>, we
      want to bring some of the community together in a single-day online event!</p>

    <p>The <strong>fsharpConf</strong> conference is organized by the F# community<!--
      and is supported by the <a href="http://www.fsharp.org">F# Software Foundation</a> -->.
      The event is the third edition, following a successful <a href="http://fsharpconf.com/2018/index.html">fsharpConf in 2018</a>
      and <a href="http://fsharpconf.com/2016/index.html">2016</a>.
      It was originally inspired by <a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/">dotNetConf</a> and we
      are excited to be continuing this great tradition of virtual events!</p>

    <h2>Recordings from previous editions</h2>
    <p>Can't wait for this awesome new content? Check out the great talks that we recorded
      at <strong>fsharpConf 2016</strong> and <strong>fsharpConf 2018</strong> covering
      quantum computing, Xamarin, Fable Docker, types and tests, the geometry of Abu
      Dhabi Louvre and much more!</p>

                    <h2>Probabilistic Programming: The What, Why and How</h2>
                    <p><img src="http://fsharpconf.com/photos/maria.jpg"></p><p>f(x) = y, but y = 5. What’s the probability that x =1? Probabilistic programming is the idea of describing probabilistic models as programs, to then automatically infer how our beliefs about model parameters change given observed data. In recent years, probabilistic programming languages (such as Stan) have demonstrated the power of this approach by becoming the underlying tool behind numerous projects in social science, biology, genetics, astrophysics, and engineering.</p>
                    <p>But why haven’t such languages been more widely adopted yet? In this talk, Maria will talk about the nuts and bolts of probabilistic programming languages, addressing the challenges behind making these languages general-purpose, automatic, and efficient. In addition, she will discuss how ideas from programming-language research can be adopted in probabilistic systems, and how F# has helped her in the endeavour of bridging the gap between statistical modelling and probabilistic inference.</p>
                    <h3>Maria Gorinova</h3>
                    <p>Maria is a PhD Student at the University of Edinburgh with broad interests range from programming languages and verification, to machine learning and human-computer interaction. More specifically,      she's interested in probabilistic programming languages, and in exploring ways of applying program-analysis techniques to existing PPLs in order to improve usability of the language or efficiency of inference. During her PhD, she has been working on these topics in relation to the probabilistic programming languages Stan and Edward2.</p>
