    <h1>Difference between shamir secret sharing (SSS) vs Mutlisig vs aggregated signatures (BLS) vs distributed key generation (dkg) vs threshold signatures posted 51 minutes ago</h1>
    <article class="mathjax"> <p>That title is a mouthful! But so is the field.</p>
<p>Let me introduce the problem: Alice owns a private key which can sign transactions. The problem is that she has a lot of money, and she is scared that someone will target her to steal all of her funds.</p>
<p>Cryptography offers some solutions to avoid this being a key management problem.</p>
<p>The first one is called <strong>Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS)</strong>, which is simply about splitting the signing private key into n shares.
Alice can then split the shares among her friends. When Alice wants to sign a transaction, she would then have to ask her friends to give her back the shares, that she can use to recreate the signing private key. Note that SSS has many many variants, for example VSSS allows participants to <strong>verify</strong> that malicious shares are not being used, and PSSS allows participants to <strong>proactively</strong> rotate their shares.</p>

<p>This is not great though, as there is a small timeframe in which Alice is the single point of failure again (the moment she holds all the shares).</p>
<p>A logical next step is to change the system, so that Alice cannot sign a transaction by herself.
A <strong>MultiSig</strong> system would require n participants to sign the same transaction and send the n signatures to the system.
This is much better, except for the fact that n signatures means that the transaction size increases linearly with the number of signers required.</p>
<p>We can do better: <strong>aggregated signatures</strong>. Signature schemes like <strong>BLS</strong> can be used exactly like the previous multisig system, except that it also allows you to compress the n signatures in a single signature. Note that it is currently much slowler, so there must be a trade off between speed and size.</p>
<p>We can do even better though!</p>
<p>With multisig or aggregated signatures, one still has to maintain a set of n public keys so that a signature can be verified. <em>Distributed Key Generation (DKG)</em> allows a set of participant to collaborate on the construction of a key pair, and on signing operations.
This is very similar to SSS, except that there is never a single point of failure. This makes DKG a <strong>Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</strong> algorithm.
Interestingly, the BLS signature scheme can also aggregate public keys into a single key that will verify their aggregated signatures, which makes it a DKG scheme as well.</p>
<p><img alt="recap" src="/upload/Screen_Shot_2019-12-19_at_4.22_.47_PM_.png"></p>
<p>Note that all these schemes can be augmented to become <strong>threshold schemes</strong>: we don&apos;t need n signatures from the n signers anymore, but only a threshold m of n.</p>
<p>Having said that, when people talk about <strong>threshold signatures</strong>, they often mean the threshold version of DKG.</p>
<p>That&apos;s the difference!</p>
<p>One last thing: there&apos;s been some recent ideas to use <strong>zero knowledge proofs (ZKP)</strong> to do what aggregated signatures do but for multiple messages (because all the previous solutions all signed the same message). The idea is to release a proof that you have verified all the signatures associated to a set of messages. If the zero knowledge proof is shorter than all the signatures, it did its job!</p>
