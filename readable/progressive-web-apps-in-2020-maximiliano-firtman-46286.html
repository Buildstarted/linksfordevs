How Progressive Web Apps look like now that 2020 is starting? What has been added in 2019 to the ecosystem that you might not be aware of? Let‚Äôs find out.</p><h2 id="1ba2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Message from the sponsor (me üòÇ)</h2><p id="4177" data-selectable-paragraph="">Last year, I delivered several updated workshops and talks on PWAs, some of them available in <a href="https://firt.mobi/talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">video</a>.

In my case, I‚Äôm defining in 2020 a PWA as a design pattern to develop app experiences using web technologies with different APIs, such as Service Workers for asset management, Web App Manifest for browser installation, Trusted Web Activities for Play Store distribution, among other.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*THlujtRrsfUy-tzCsOc44A.png?q=20" width="1416" height="786" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="1416" height="786" role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1416/1*THlujtRrsfUy-tzCsOc44A.png"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">A modern PWA Cheat Sheet form my <a href="https://firt.mobi/talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JSConf Europe 2019 talk</a></figcaption></figure><p id="02c9" data-selectable-paragraph="">It‚Äôs difficult to have information about how many companies are creating PWAs or how users are reacting to them in terms of installation. I didn‚Äôt particularly felt in 2019 an increase in companies going for PWAs or users using them more. There are some niches like people looking for privacy removing native apps, but it‚Äôs not the big market out there.</p><p id="48f7" data-selectable-paragraph="">We saw during 2019 one of the most visited websites in the world going PWA: YouPorn, but we don‚Äôt have info on usage. You can see the info about the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/19/youporn-goes-progressive-with-new-mobile-web-apps-for-android-and-ios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">YP PWA here</a> (no porn in the link, open it with confidence.)</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*pe2Xqcl4CF7WO5G9_Vpl8g.png?q=20" width="1678" height="856" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="1678" height="856" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">One of the most visited website in the world is now a Progressive Web App</figcaption></figure><p id="50b7" data-selectable-paragraph="">What it‚Äôs still new (for developers, website owners, and users) is that PWAs can be installed on the desktop. I didn‚Äôt see so many desktop-optimized PWAs yet, but from 2020 and Microsoft push with the new Edge we may see this growing. During 2019, Starbucks and Uber took the time to talk about their PWAs running on the desktop, such as in <a href="https://eng.uber.com/web-booking-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Building a more seamless booking flow for Uber</a>.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Produck is one of the first desktop-optimized PWA that I found published early 2019</figcaption></figure><p id="2a89" data-selectable-paragraph="">The only recent data we have about PWAs comes from Samsung Internet browser:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="6ea7" data-selectable-paragraph="">So we have 80,000 different origins with at least one PWA inside in the period April-December 2019; while it‚Äôs not a fair count of different PWAs, it‚Äôs a good approximation. Samsung Internet counts for +6% of users, so it‚Äôs a good amount of users to take that value as representative for the whole web.</p><p id="49d3" data-selectable-paragraph="">You can say it‚Äôs not so good compared with 2.9 million apps in the Play Store or 3.9 million apps in the App Store. However, we don‚Äôt know how many of those apps had at least one install in the past 9 months to have a fair comparison. Also, because we have the information on domains and not different PWAs, it might be a good idea to compare 80,000 with the number of different publishers in the stores, counting around 800,000 in the Play Store and 792,000 in the AppStore. Taking this amount, we can say there might be 10% of PWAs compared with native apps. But we need to remember, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/the-top-1-of-app-store-publishers-drive-80-of-new-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">80% of new downloads from stores come from only 1% of publishers</a>. Now with PWAs in the Google Play Store, the comparison will become more difficult.</p><p id="bb57" data-selectable-paragraph="">Progressive Web Apps have full support (service workers included) when used in a browser in <strong>93% of current users browsing the web.</strong></p><p id="7d97" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>PWA can be installed as standalone experiences in 86% of users</strong> (82% installation from the browser, 4% is only from stores and not from their current used browsers).</p><p id="2bbf" data-selectable-paragraph="">We can install PWAs in <strong>Android, iOS, iPadOS, Windows 10 (</strong>and future<strong> 10X), Windows 7, Windows 8.x, Xbox One, macOS, Linux 64 bits, Chrome OS </strong>and<strong> kaiOS</strong>.</p><p id="b68c" data-selectable-paragraph="">We can also say that PWAs can‚Äôt be installed in any way in Smartwatches, Smart TVs, Apple TV, Chromecast, Android TV, PlayStation, Tesla cars (yes, the car has a browser), another game consoles, digital assistants such as Facebook Portal, Nest Home or Amazon Echo, or VR/AR headsets such as Oculus headsets.</p><p id="5a69" data-selectable-paragraph="">I see the potential of PWAs on VR/AR headsets, digital assistants and event game consoles, but they will also fight against internal politics in their companies.</p><p id="c8cf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let‚Äôs see the platforms where we can install PWA in January 2020</p><h2 id="6546" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Android</strong></h2><p id="0f57" data-selectable-paragraph="">We can install Progressive Web Apps on Android devices (phones and tablets) using the following methods:</p><ul><li id="4194" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong><em>Browser installation:</em></strong> Chrome (<em>WebAPK</em>) / Firefox / Samsung Internet (<em>WebAPK only on Samsung devices</em>) / UC / Edge / Opera / Brave / Baidu.

Instead of publishing a URL, you need to publish a PWA Launcher, a native app that opens the browser in standalone mode, rendering the URL of the PWA.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*s0--fDVP5tGhARBI?q=20" width="2044" height="1028" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="2044" height="1028" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">At Chrome Dev summit, the browser team mentioned OYO Lite, a PWA in the Google Play Store, confirming for the first time that TWAs -shipped several months before- can be used for PWA store distribution</figcaption></figure><p id="069a" data-selectable-paragraph="">Trusted Web Activities were available all 2019 but Chrome didn‚Äôt publicly talk about using that feature to publish PWAs in the Play Store for 10 months (politics within Google II; you can‚Äôt imagine how many messages I got from random people saying that I was lying because ‚ÄúTWAs were not for PWAs in the Store (sic)‚Äù). It‚Äôs still a great feature that is hidden in public sight, and I didn‚Äôt see any updates for the future of the technology (there were ideas to connect native code with the TWA for example). TWAs are currently supported in Chrome. It‚Äôs based on the open protocol Custom Tabs (being renamed to Android Helper Browser Library), so other browsers such as Firefox and Samsung Internet will add support for it soon (it‚Äôs already available in Firefox Preview and Samsung announced it will bet there but <a href="https://link.medium.com/pNySTfhMW2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will be discouraged</a>). That means the user will be able to change the engine she wants to use for PWAs from the Play Store.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*DOO6VpARx1dJfO8vM6Aa3Q.png?q=20" width="2140" height="1392" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="2140" height="1392" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">Samsung Galaxy Store is supporting web app submissions</figcaption></figure><p id="9848" data-selectable-paragraph="">Samsung during 2019 added a simple way to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/using-twa" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">submit PWAs to the Galaxy Store</a> without any need for packaging ‚Äî what we all were expecting from Google Play Store. The feature is still manual (submission is done through an email address) and PWAs appear under a ‚Äúweb app‚Äù section which I‚Äôm not sure I like as users don‚Äôt care about the technology behind. I‚Äôm not sure how many active users that store though.</p><h2 id="6d55" data-selectable-paragraph="">Search engine indexing</h2><p id="d9a1" data-selectable-paragraph="">Microsoft announced in 2017 that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps/microsoft-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bing will index Progressive Web Apps</a> from 2018 and they will be listed automatically in the Microsoft Store for Windows 10. The reality is that <strong>this project is a failure</strong>.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="1cda" data-selectable-paragraph="">And even if Microsoft didn‚Äôt release any statement saying this feature was shut down, I didn‚Äôt see any new PWAs being added to the Store under this mechanism and I <a href="https://twitter.com/firt/status/1102626427025920000" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">heard in a podcast in 2019</a> that Microsoft is not encouraging this anymore and developers should create the APPX package to submit the PWA manually to the store.</p><p id="a841" data-selectable-paragraph="">Because of all the internal politics, I‚Äôm not seeing Google web crawler doing this anytime soon, unfortunately.</p><h2 id="5840" data-selectable-paragraph="">Enterprise distribution</h2><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*WV5VqkZi2quh4mBe.png?q=20" width="1034" height="797" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="1034" height="797" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">Adding PWAs to enterprise users; the Web App Manifest is ignored and we can set up only basic metadata from the web portal</figcaption></figure><p id="c37d" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is one of the features that are probably less used today (also less known).

The Play Store will use the WebAPK minting service to create an APK from a URL and offer it to users. It‚Äôs unfortunate to see this in action for enterprise users and not for the public store for end-users; it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs not a technological barrier.</p><p id="665a" data-selectable-paragraph="">On the Apple side, we have the Mobile Configuration file accepted by iOS and iPadOS. Using Apple Configurator 2 you can create these files that can include Web Clips (icons in the home screen).

My initial testing says it‚Äôs not, but further testing is needed.</em></p><p id="2052" data-selectable-paragraph="">In terms of abilities of PWAs in 2020, I think we can split the ecosystem in three:</p><ul><li id="cc5f" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Chromium empire</strong>: With the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/teams/web-capabilities-fugu" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">project Fugu</a> and <a href="https://chromestatus.com/features" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new abilities</a>, new APIs have appeared in 2019 and more are coming in 2020 that will increase the abilities of the Web Platform for Google Chrome, Samsung Internet, Microsoft Edge, and others. That‚Äôs why in this empire you will find better abilities this year, including more background execution mechanisms, hardware and platform access (such as Contacts, WebNFC, Shortcut menus for PWAs, Screen enumeration, Tabbed application mode, Window Application Placing) along with what‚Äôs already there (WebAssembly, WebRTC, WebPush, WebAuthn, WebShare, WebXR, RequestPayment, etc.)</li></ul><p id="1579" data-selectable-paragraph="">Having said that, there are some features (mostly when talking about the Android platform) that are taking a different pace that in my opinion has to do with this internal fight between Android/Play Store and Chrome within Google: Trusted Web Activities evolution, Install badge in the omnibox, or the 2 years that it took to Chrome to support proper icons for Android 8+ with the new Maskable icon format. On desktop, Chrome seems to be moving faster when it has to do with platform integration.</p><ul><li id="81d8" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>WebKit kingdom</strong>: it‚Äôs known that the WebKit team (powering Safari) doesn‚Äôt follow the Chromium empire in its need for more power in the Web, and they are more cautious and interested in privacy and performance before abilities. Some abilities are currently there (such as WebAssembly, WebAuthn -initial release-, Sign In with Apple, Apple Pay, and RequestPayment), but others such as hardware access, WebPush or background execution don‚Äôt look like something that will happen anytime soon on WebKit. You can take a look at what WebKit wants for this year at this <a href="https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKitGoalsfor2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">roadmap 2020 draft</a> and what‚Äôs actually <a href="https://webkit.org/status/#?status=under%20consideration" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">under consideration</a> or <a href="https://webkit.org/status/#?status=in%20development" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in development</a>.</li><li id="60ad" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>The edge of the world</strong>: Here we have a set of engines that don‚Äôt have a clear path for the future, including <a href="https://platform-status.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gecko</a> (that implements a lot of APIs from the Chromium empire, but in the PWA world is much slower and without clear ideas for the future), kaiOS (that seems stuck in older version of Gecko without transparency about the future engine), TWA and Windows Store Universal Windows APIs.</li></ul><p id="3afd" data-selectable-paragraph="">2019 introduced as with three new concepts that will affect PWA design:</p><ul><li id="deaf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Dark mode</li><li id="76e2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Foldable devices</li><li id="ec4f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Maskable icons</li></ul><h2 id="ae36" data-selectable-paragraph="">Dark mode</h2><p id="dc52" data-selectable-paragraph="">For dark mode, while the content of your PWA can be changed by using CSS media queries, the Web App Manifest spec is not up to the task and there is no way to customize icons or theme color easily for dark mode.

There is still nothing specific for them and on some platforms, the experience can be between buggy and just a window resize.
