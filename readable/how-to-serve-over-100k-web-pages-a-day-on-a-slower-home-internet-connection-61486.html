   <p>The cheapest way to run a website is from the home Internet 
      connection that you already have.  It's essentially free if you 
      host your website on a very low-power computer like a Raspberry 
      Pi.  The problem with this approach is that upload bandwidth 
      is often very limited on home Internet connections, so your 
      website may occasionally miss potential traffic during 
      "high-traffic" periods.  For this reason, and because of the 
      headache associated with hosting a website from a computer in 
      your physical possession, the conventional wisdom is that you 
      should not host a website from a server based in your home.  
      However, there are ways of capturing high-traffic spikes even 
      on many low-bandwidth home Internet connections.</p><p>Let's look at some numbers.  The type of Internet service one can 
      get in the United States varies widely from place to place.  So, many 
      in the US are stuck with home Internet connections that are less 
      conducive to hosting a home webserver.  Let's assume your only option 
      is AT&amp;T's 12 Mbit/s DSL service, which has an upload speed that 
      fluctuates from second-to-second between 64 KBytes/s and 128 KBytes/s 
      (between 512Kbits/s and 1 Mbit/s).  This means that after the overhead 
      associated with the connection, your average data upload speed is only 
      about 90 KBytes/s.  Now, let's say your website is a fairly average 
      blog that gets around 3000 visitors and 6000 page views a month.  On 
      a 90 KB/s connection, your webserver should have no problem at all 
      handling that kind of traffic on normal days.</p>

   <p>On rare occasions, however, you post that golden article on social 
      media that goes viral and many more people than usual want to read 
      it.  Let's assume that a particular article takes an average of 2.16 
      seconds to be accessed from your server by each of your readers.  That 
      means that it can only be read about 40,000 times in a 24-hour 
      period.  Things are a little more complicated by a number of factors,
      including the fact that readers 
      will not come in a steady stream.  But, let's say for this 
      hypothetical scenario, which is a best-case scenario for you, that 
      readers do come in a fairly steady stream.  Let's say 70,000 people 
      attempt to read the article in the first day after you post it.  That 
      means 30,000 readers will not be able to read your article during that 
      first-day traffic spike.  Since your website normally gets only 
      around 72,000 page views per year, missing out on 30,000 page views 
      during that one-day traffic spike means you lose a substantial portion 
      of your potential readers for the year.</p>

   <p>Don't give up hope just yet, however.  There are ways of capturing 
      those rare traffic spikes.  Given that you can't increase your upload 
      speed, and you can't tell your readers to wait until tomorrow to read
      your article, you 
      generally have only two viable options for getting your article to 
      more readers in a short amount of time: 1) reduce the amount of data 
      that must be uploaded, and 2) maximize the percentage of time that 
      your server is actually transmitting data, as opposed to doing other 
      things like connecting to the visitor's browser, SSL handshaking, 
      waiting for the visitor's browser to make the next request, etc.</p>

   <p>Before we get into the details, let me talk generally about what 
      happens when a visitor brings up one of your web pages in his 
      browser.  I'll only give generalities, because we are only really 
      concerned about the chain of events and how to increase the speed of 
      each event.  First, the visitor's browser queries a DNS server to 
      get your website's IP address.  Then his browser connects to your 
      webserver and a mostly one-way conversation takes place about the 
      characteristics of 
      his browser and his computer.  This is called the connection portion 
      of the page transfer.  Then, if your website is an HTTPS website, an 
      SSL handshake takes place where the TLS protocols that will be used 
      are established, the webserver gives it's SSL certificate, and the 
      browser verifies that it is legitimate.  The SSL handshake alone can 
      take as long as a third of a second.  Once the browser trusts the 
      webserver and a secure connection has been established, the data 
      transfer is ready to begin.</p>

   <p>The data on your web page is transmitted in stages, called requests.  
      Each type of data is requested in a different request.  First the 
      HTML file for the page is requested by the visitor's browser.  Then, 
      data is sent one request at a time for each file that is referenced 
      inside the HTML code.  Examples of files that can be referenced in 
      HTML code are CSS data files, picture files, video files, sound 
      files, and favicon files.  If your web page contains 50 pictures, the 
      visitor's browser must make 50 requests to get all 50 pictures.</p> 

   <p>After each request, the browser waits for the webserver to receive the 
      request and begin sending back data.  Some amount of wait time is 
      always required for the beginning of the data transmission to reach the 
      browser.  Depending on the distance from the webserver to the 
      visitor's computer, the wait time associated with each request can be 
      anywhere from a few milliseconds to a quarter of a second or more.  If 
      a web page has 50 pictures and the visitor is on the other side 
      of the world from the webserver, it is possible that transmitting 
      those 50 pictures one at a time could take over 12.5 seconds plus the 
      time required to transmit the data in the picture files.  Often, 
      many requests occur in parallel, however, so the elapsed time to send 50 
      pictures may be significantly less than 12.5 seconds.  But, it doesn't 
      have to be.</p>

   <p>Timelines can also be complicated even more by the fact 
      that a webserver may have several visitors all trying to download the 
      same web page at the same time, and many of the requests  
      by different visitors may be occurring in parallel.  
      This is another reason that predicting the exact time required to 
      download a web page can be difficult.</p>

   <p>Now that you have a basic understanding of what happens when a 
      visitor's browser downloads web pages from a webserver, let's talk 
      about 7 ways you can increase the amount of traffic your server can 
      handle on a low-bandwidth connection.</p>
   <h2>1. Make Sure You don't have any Page Loading Issues:</h2>
   <p>You can make many types of mistakes in creating a web page, so I won't 
      list them all here.  The Google web console and web page load-speed 
      testers like the <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/">Pingdom Website 
      Speed Test</a> will look for mistakes on your web page and show you 
      any that they find.  The first thing you need to do to increase the 
      load speeds of your web pages is to remove all of these mistakes.</p>
   <h2>2. Create Static or Mostly Static Web Pages:</h2>
   <p><a href="https://www.takeshape.io/articles/why-the-best-websites-are-static/">Static</a> 
      web pages generally load much faster than dynamic web pages and 
      require less bandwidth.  One reason is that static pages do 
      not require JavaScript to be sent to a visitor's browser.  If 
      you must have some dynamic content, consider using PHP code that runs 
      on your server instead of your visitor's computer.  But remember, the 
      more code you run on your server, the more powerful your server must 
      be, and increased power means increased electricity costs.  If you 
      have a low-bandwidth Internet connection and don't want to have high 
      electricity costs, you should forget about animation on your web 
      pages.  Forget about database programs.  Forget about anything other 
      than very simple code running inside your web pages.  Most of the eye 
      candy you see on the Internet these days is served via high-speed 
      Internet connections by servers costing thousands of dollars each that 
      are owned by large companies that can afford to pay for them and the 
      electricity to run them.  Unfortunately, nearly all the information that 
      you are likely to find about the best approach for developing a 
      website will be about these types of websites.  Don't fall 
      into the trap of thinking these are the only types of websites you 
      can build.</p>

   <p>If you absolutely must have some dynamic content, think very carefully 
      about ways of minimizing it.  For example, instead of a full analytics 
      package, write your own PHP code that does nothing more than count the 
      number of times a page is visited.  Instead of running some commercial 
      visitor comment code that also requires you to run a database program, 
      write your own smaller, faster code.  Or, use 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/babbleweb.html">Babbleweb</a> for visitor comments.  And, 
      consider disabling comments after 20 or 30 have accumulated on a 
      particular article.</p>
   <h2>3. Reduce the Amount of Data on Each Web Page:</h2>
   <p>Reducing the amount of data per web page that your server must upload 
      can increase page load speeds significantly.  For example, going 
      from three, 500 KB pictures on a page to one 50 KB picture can save 
      over 16 seconds on a 90 KByte/s Internet connection.  Even reducing 
      the amount of HTML text by writing more succinctly or breaking a long 
      article up into two or more shorter articles can help.  And, if your 
      CSS code is in a separate file from your HTML code, you should clean 
      up your CSS code to get rid of anything that is no longer used and 
      minimize the number of comments.  It goes without saying that a text 
      file takes much less time to upload than the same information 
      presented in an audio or video file format.</p>

   <p>Don't forget to use picture file formats that minimize the file size 
      of your pictures.  You should experiment with sites like 
      <a href="https://picresize.com/">Picresize</a> and 
      <a href="https://compressor.io/compress">Compress.io</a> to see how 
      much compression you can get away with and still have 
      pictures that will not detract from the overall appearance of your 
      website.</p>
   <h2>4. Reduce the Number of Requests per Page:</h2>
   <p>As the introduction to this article notes, the number of requests a 
      visitor's browser must make to get the entire contents of a web page 
      can have a large effect on the page load time.  So, it pays to 
      minimize the number of unnecessary pictures and other types of data 
      included in your web pages.  Also consider putting CSS code inside 
      HTML files, rather than in separate files.  Putting CSS code in a 
      separate file that is used by multiple HTML files allows you to more 
      easily change the look of your website, but it also means that an 
      additional request must be made for each web page that includes that 
      CSS file.</p>

   <p>Any visitor that tries to access a page on your website via HTTP and 
      must be transferred to the HTTPS page takes up an additional request.  
      Think of ways of minimizing the number of times that happens.  Speaking 
      of HTTP vs. HTTPS, no one seems to mention that the price you pay for 
      the added security of HTTPS is increased bandwidth and CPU 
      requirements.  The SSL handshake alone can increase the page load time 
      by more than a quarter of a second.</p>
   <h2>5. Compress Your Web Pages:</h2>
   <p>Most webservers can automatically compress content before uploading 
      it to visitors' browsers.  This can reduce the amount of data that 
      must be uploaded for HTML and CSS code by 50 to 70%.  As far as I can 
      tell, compression does not take a lot of CPU power.  I've also noticed 
      that when one dynamic web page is receiving a large amount of traffic, 
      the Lighttpd webserver appears to hold that dynamically-compressed 
      page in RAM for a while, so it doesn't have to re-compress the page 
      before each upload.  Static web pages are only compressed once, no 
      matter how many times they are uploaded.</p> 

   <p>You should compress your picture files <i>before</i> you include 
      them in your web pages.  As a result, asking your server to compress 
      pictures again does not reduce their file sizes significantly. It only 
      increases your CPU requirements.  So, you should tell your webserver 
      not to compress pictures.</p>
   <h2>6. Don't use Website Development Software to Create Your Website:</h2>
   <p>Not using commercial website development software goes against just 
      about everything everyone else on the Internet is telling you.
      Nevertheless, it is the right thing to do for low-bandwidth Internet 
      connections.  To illustrate my point, I picked <a href="https://ma.tt/2020/04/five-levels-of-autonomy/">this 
      web page</a> from Matt Mullenweg's blog that runs on Wordpress.  I 
      chose this web page because it is mostly text with just a few pictures 
      and no advertising.  This page has 9669 bytes of text that the reader 
      sees, but the HTML file contains 144591 bytes of HTML code, thanks to 
      Wordpress!  For comparison, I picked 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/trade-war.html">this 
      article</a> from my website that I wrote myself in HTML.  It has one 
      picture and no advertising.  The reader sees 9698 bytes of text, and 
      the HTML file contains only only 15074 bytes of code.  That's about 
      one tenth of the code in Matt's article!  I could probably have 
      reduced that to less than 12000 bytes if I had really wanted to.
      By the way, I also have a 3105 byte CSS file that is included in 
      my HTML file.  Matt's HTML file includes three CSS files that I
      did not bother to find the sizes of.</p>

   <p>Now, let's look at the cost of letting Wordpress create your HTML 
      code.  The time required to upload the 15074 bytes of HTML code in my 
      article over 
      a 90 KB/s Internet connection would be 0.167 seconds.  The time to 
      upload Matt Mullenweg's HTML code over the same Internet connection 
      would be 1.607 seconds.  HTML code is usually compressed before it is 
      sent to the reader, so the time difference would not be as large as 
      that, but it would still be significant.</p>

   <p>The average time to load 
      just the compressed HTML portion of my article, the associated 
      compressed CSS file, and a small favicon file according to 
      https://tools.pingdom.com with a slight adjustment to simulate a 90 KB/s 
      connection is 0.496 seconds, and 0.076 seconds of that is due to 
      uploading my HTML file that has been compressed to 6.8 KB.  
      Assuming Matt's article is compressed by the same ratio, just the HTML 
      code of his article would take about 
      (0.496 - 0.076 + (6.8/15.1)*144.6/90) 
      = 1.144 seconds to come up in the reader's browser.  This means that 
      without considering embedded pictures about 2.3 of my 
      articles (1.144/0.496 = 2.31) can be uploaded to readers in the same 
      amount of time as Matt's article.  So, over an 
      Internet connection that can upload 90 KBytes/s, readers could view the 
      text-only portion of Matt's article about 76000 time per day and the 
      text-only portion of my article about 174000 times per day. 
      In other words, the text of my article can be viewed about 98000 
      times a day more than Matt's.  That 98000 additional page views 
      could be a significant portion of the yearly traffic for a small 
      website.  So, even with HTML code compression, it is still worthwhile 
      to write your own HTML code.</p>

   <p>Note that I have simplified my anlaysis
      by not taking into account the slight improvement that many 
      visitors requesting pages at the same time could receive due to some 
      amount of parallel delivery of web pages.  However, the basic fact that
      my web page can be read by several tens of thousands more visitors per 
      day than Matt's is still correct.</p>
   <h2>7. Use a Free CDN service to Temporarily Host Pictures in New 
       Articles</h2>
   <p>For typical web pages, picture files often contain more data than 
      HTML files, so it can be very beneficial in terms of bandwidth to host 
      pictures somewhere other than on your webserver.  One place you can 
      move your pictures is to a CDN (Content Delivery Network).  The HTML 
      file of your web page will then have a link to the picture on the 
      CDN, instead of a link to the picture on your webserver.  For those 
      of you who do not want to rely on a CDN to permanently host part of 
      your content, there is another way.  Most traffic spikes occur within 
      the first week of posting a new article on social media.  So, you 
      will probably only need to host pictures in new articles on a CDN for 
      the first week after publishing them.  After that, you can put your 
      pictures on your own webserver.  For small websites, CDN's are likely 
      to charge by the amount of content hosted, rather than by the number 
      of downloads, so hosting only a few pictures at a time can mean you 
      pay little or nothing for the use of the CDN service.</p>
   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>Here are the seven ways that I have suggested for capturing those peak 
      traffic spikes that may occasionally occur on your webserver:</p>
   <br>

   <div>
   <h3>7 Tips for Hosting a Website on a Low-Bandwidth Internet Connection</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>Make Sure You don't have any Page Loading Issues.</li>
      <li>Create Static or Mostly Static Web Pages.</li>
      <li>Reduce the Amount of Data on Each Web Page.</li>
      <li>Reduce the Number of Requests per Page.</li>
      <li>Compress Your Web Pages.</li>
      <li>Don't use Website Development Software to Create Your Web Pages.</li>
      <li>Use a Free CDN service to Temporarily Host Pictures in New Articles.</li>
   </ol>
   </div>
   

   <p>By using these methods, you may be able to increase the peak traffic 
      that your webserver can handle on your low-bandwidth home Internet 
      connection by a factor of four, five, or even more.  This can allow 
      you to continue hosting your website from home virtually for free, 
      even when your website is getting occasional traffic spikes of 
      well over a hundred thousand page views a day.</p>
