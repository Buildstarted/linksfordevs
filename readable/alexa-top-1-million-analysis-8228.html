						<p>It's a little late but here it is! The analysis of the Alexa Top 1 Million sites for February of 2019. We have good news, increased numbers, new comparisons and more!</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h4 id="the-crawl">The crawl</h4><p>I can't believe this is the <em>8th</em> report I've done on the Alexa Top 1 Million and the project has been going for over 4 years now. As always, the data has been taken from my <a href="https://crawler.ninja/">crawlers</a> so you can check out the raw data over there and maybe consider making a small donation to keep them running! Without any further interruption though, let's dive into the data and look what's changed over the last 6 months. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

Here are the highlights of the Feb 2019 data:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-9.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h4 id="https">HTTPS</h4><p>Not as much growth as I'd like but another 12.9% increase in HTTPS in the top 1 million taking us to a little over 58% in total. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-10.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>You can see on the graph above the rate of growth is slowing, and it's even more obvious here. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-11.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Still though, the line is going in the right direction and we should be really happy with that, I just want to make sure we're not starting to see the introduction of a plateau...</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-12.png" width="40%"></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h4 id="hpkp">HPKP</h4><p>I talked in my last report about how I was <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/im-giving-up-on-hpkp/">giving up on HPKP</a> and that Chrome <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/the-death-knell-for-hpkp/">was deprecating it</a>, but while the deprecation hasn't taken place just yet, we've seen a massive blow to the HPKP numbers with PKP headers dropping 92% and PKPRO headers dropping 97%. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-13.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Whilst the graph is now showing a trend in use at the top, which is a complete reverse from the last report, the real thing to note is the massive reduction in the Y axis values. Here's the HPKP graph from Aug 2018 for comparison purposes.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-6.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Digging further into this data, it seems the entire crash in the use of HPKP can be attributed to one site, Tumblr. In the previous report I noted that the vast majority of sites using HPKP were <code>*.tumblr.com</code> and obviously had the policy site for them. In this report there isn't a single trace of HPKP on those same sites.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Things are continuing to go well for the adoption of Security Headers with growth in usage in all the right places. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-14.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Use of CSP saw a rise of almost 24%, STS just over 9.5% and XXP saw just over 11% too. That's some pretty significant growth but again the numbers are slightly down on the last report. We're still going in the right direction though!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h4 id="let-s-encrypt">Let's Encrypt</h4><p>Following the growth in HTTPS we're also seeing continued growth for Let's Encrypt too. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-15.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The numbers look a little erratic lower down the ranking but there is more movement of sites there compared to those near the top of the ranking which tend to be a lot more stable. That aside though, there is still a definite increase in the presence of Let's Encrypt certs in the Alexa Top 1 Million! For those interested here are the top 10 issuing intermediates in the Alexa Top 1 Million:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><pre><code><span>C</span> = US, O = Let<span>'s Encrypt, CN = Let'</span>s Encrypt Authority X3 <span>204</span>,<span>625</span>

The EV number would still rise, but they were being outpaced by DV resulting in a net loss of market share for EV. This scan sees a further blow to the use of EV certificates which were present on 25,158 sites in August 2018 but only 23,705 sites in February 2019. An extra 63,136 sites turned on HTTPS in the last 6 months, but there's 1,453 less EV certificates. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-16.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The largest issuer of EV certificates in the Alexa Top 1 Million is ranked as the 13th largest certificate issuer overall and only issued 6,146 EV certificates.

There is a small cluster of sites that set the CAA records in particularly high numbers and while they have moved up the ranking slightly, you can see that the pattern is still the same.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h4 id="security-txt">security.txt</h4><p>I introduced tracking for the new <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/say-hello-to-security-txt/">security.txt</a> file in the last scan so this will be the first time we can compare numbers, and.... they're down...</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-18.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>From 11,994 back in Aug 18 down to 5,805 in Feb 19 that's a pretty significant drop. Nothing has changed on the crawler in that time, same infrastructure and code, so I don't think it's anything I did. Looking at the data there are some big chunks of sites lower down the ranking that used to have security.txt files, which you can see on the blue line, and they no longer have files in such numbers. It could be that the group dropped out of the ranking or they're a group of managed sites that had it removed, but, they're definitely not there now....</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h4 id="referrer-policy">Referrer Policy</h4><p>The <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/a-new-security-header-referrer-policy/">Referrer Policy</a> is another recently added metric so we can do some comparison now.

I added metrics to the crawler to look at various aspects of TLS configuration and whilst things are improving, we still have a long way to go in some areas.

Unsurprisingly we see 2 suites using RSA keys for authentication at the top of the list and an ECDSA suite only making it in 3rd place. They do all support <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/perfect-forward-secrecy/">Forward Secrecy</a> though and that's a great thing using the EC version of the DHE key exchange. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-23.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Next up is the TLS protocol itself and my crawler supports everything up to TLSv1.2, there no TLSv1.3 just yet. That means the values you see on these diagrams are the highest TLS protocol version the server at the other end supports. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-24.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>TLSv1.2 is way out there in the lead, there's a tiny sliver of TLSv1 down at the bottom and as you'd probably expect almost no TLSv1.1 at all. Remember, these protocol version are the <em>highest</em> the site we scanned can support, it's a bit worry to see anything other than TLSv1.2 on here really. To show that another way, the vast majority of sites do support TLSv1.2 but there are still some out there that don't. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-25.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I'm hoping to have the crawlers update with TLSv1.3 support before the next report so we should be able to include some numbers for that next time. </p><h4 id="get-the-data">Get the data</h4><p>I make all of the data that this report was based on available in my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IvrkNgwBLf88XQUoUUHmgNeIJAGKZPdA5HRJ6_KoUe8/edit#gid=1934235273">Google Sheet here</a>.
