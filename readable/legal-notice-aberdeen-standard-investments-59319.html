<p>The term "third-party" indicates that rather than having a direct relationship with a user, a company has a relationship with one or more of the websites that a user visits.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a user visits standardlifeaberdeen.com directly, that website is the "first party."&nbsp;&nbsp;If standardlifeaberdeen.com partners with an advertising network, platform, or exchange to place ads, the network, platform, or exchange is the "third party."&nbsp;&nbsp;The advertising network uses cookies when the user visits standardlifeaberdeen.com to help it select and serve the best ad. These cookies are considered "third-party cookies."&nbsp;&nbsp;First parties partner with third parties in this way because third parties have technology and expertise to enable more efficient ad placement across websites. Working with brands, publishers and websites, use third-party cookies to make advertising more engaging and relevant to users and more valuable to publishers and advertisers.</p>
