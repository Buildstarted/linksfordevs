# 🤔 Why YAML is the right devops technology for you 🤔
#
# - 100% test coverage, always compiles just fine with no errors or warnings, always shippable
# - no enforced error handling during development because runtime "panic at the disco" in production is dope
# - "something broke" is way better than stack traces with line numbers
# - you need to burn hours as part of setting up a new CI pipeline
# - safe choice with unquestionable industry adoption, "used by kubernetes"
# - is marginally better than windows.ini
# - unlike json [1], YAML supports comments
# - you need a super safe way to "execute this code"

# 🍿 wait a sec, did you say "executable yaml"?? 🍿

# 🚨 Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway 🚨
# `NO` is parsed as a boolean type, which with the YAML 1.1 spec, there are 22 options to write "true" or "false."
# You have to wrap "NO" in quotes to get the expected result.
NI: Nicaragua
NL: Netherlands
NO: Norway # 💣!
