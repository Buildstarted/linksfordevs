# Improvements welcome, mash the &#x2197;&#xFE0F; Octocat &#x2197;&#xFE0F; and share how YAML makes your life better. No: Body: Wants: To: Write: - YAML # &#x1F914; Why YAML is the right devops technology for you &#x1F914;
#
# - 100% test coverage, always compiles just fine with no errors or warnings, always shippable
# - no enforced error handling during development because runtime &quot;panic at the disco&quot; in production is dope
# - &quot;something broke&quot; is way better than stack traces with line numbers
# - you need to burn hours as part of setting up a new CI pipeline
# - safe choice with unquestionable industry adoption, &quot;used by kubernetes&quot;
# - is marginally better than windows.ini
# - unlike json [1], YAML supports comments
# - you need a super safe way to &quot;execute this code&quot; # &#x1F37F; wait a sec, did you say &quot;executable yaml&quot;?? &#x1F37F;

# `NO` is parsed as a boolean type, which with the YAML 1.1 spec, there are 22 options to write &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false.&quot;
# You have to wrap &quot;NO&quot; in quotes to get the expected result.

# &quot;Today we&#x2019;re going to look at some general problems with the YAML format&quot;
# &#x1F449; https://arp242.net/yaml-config.html &#x1F448;
#
# &quot;We replaced 1,000 lines of YAML with 10 structs and people started contributing again&quot;

# &quot;What if you used the same language and tools you use to define your app to define your infrastructure?&quot;

# &quot;A YAML file is almost always still &apos;valid&apos; even if it is trunca&quot;
# &#x1F449; https://twitter.com/colmmacc/status/1057316977457324032 &#x1F448;
#
# &quot;the bug was that the YAML parser ignored the negative signs ... so negative GPS coordinates became positive ones&quot;

# &quot;Every YAML parser is a custom YAML parser&quot;
