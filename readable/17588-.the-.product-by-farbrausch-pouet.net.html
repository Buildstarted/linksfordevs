Or go work at some ad agency, or anything else, but the demo scene has always been for showing off skills, be it those of coders, musicians, or graphicians, and I DO hope this will never change.<br>Even for full-size demos, this should be the fact again... there are so many well-designed demos which i can't watch because it's made by guys with a nice feeling for design, but not even the most basic skills you'd need for doing flat shading. And IMO, this does suck.<p>And the fact that also 64k demos are rated only by their "artistic" level (as if any of them would reach a level which real "artists" wouldn't laugh at) does quite scare me off.</p><p>Then, what is "artistic" ?</p><p>I don't want to say, that I consider FR08 that much of an artistic demo, no, the scenes definitely don't fit together, the music was done quite in a hurry without letting me getting used to the synth and its possibilities, and our general mood at the end was something like "ok, let's shock the scene a bit, we've enough time to do a GOOD intro thereafter"..</p><p>... but who the f*** does define that thisandthat is art and other things are not?</p><p>Why can't the way the camera moves be artistic and thoughtful? Many (99%) of those "considered art" demos have camera movements which fly around the object, and fly around, and then fly around them, without any sense, somewhere in the senseless gap between "no real camera operator would so something silly like that" and "nah, for a special effect it's just too boring". But still, FR08 (and also Kasparov eg.) are considered "boring 3D flybys", even if their camera movements have NOTHING in common with most of the rest of the demos. </p><p>Look at the completely overrated "Purple" by Orion eg. Does it have a story? No, sorry, if i remove the texts, i have 3D flybys of the most boring and senseless kind, some mediocre music, but hey, let's put some texts about an enslaved civilisation below them and soon everybody thinks it's "art" and doesn't even recognize that this handfull of polygons doesn't run in a sufficient speed with GeForce DDR and 256 Megs of RAM. That's cool. Art is the perfect disguise for lack of skills and creativity.</p><p>crs, it's perfectly ok that you dislike FR08, it's ok if it doesn't give anything to you, but don't try to define what's "art" here - and don't try to define what's important for the scene and what isn't, ok?</p><p>So, enough of flaming, now let's all go back to work and produce some creative, stunning, artsy cutting-ende demos and intros for MS2001, thanks :)</p></div></div></div></div>
