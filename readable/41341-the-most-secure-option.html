    <h1>The Most Secure Option</h1>
    <div class="article-body"> <p>&#x201C;The auditors have finished examining our codebase.&#x201D;</p> <p>That was how <strong>Randy</strong>&#x2019;s boss started the meeting, and she delivered the line like a doctor who just got the tests back, and is trying to break the news gently.</p> <p>After someone in another department did the whole &#x201C;I found a thumb drive in the parking lot, let me plug it into my work laptop!&#x201D; thing, management realized that they hadn&#x2019;t done any kind of security evaluation in years, and brought in a bunch of highly paid consultants to evaluate their practices. Part of that meant doing audits of their software portfolio for compliance with the new security standards.</p> <p>Now, Randy&#x2019;s boss was running a cross-functional meeting- developers, operations, and even a few support desk representatives, to review the audit results. Most of the hits they took on the audit were the kind of slipshod stuff that accrues over years of under-budgeted, over-specced projects. Passwords stored in source control. A few SQL injection vulns. But the one that seemed like an easy win was the fact that they didn&#x2019;t use any SSL on their web applications.</p> <p>&#x201C;Oh, we should be able to fix that, easy,&#x201D; Randy said.</p> <p>&#x201C;Oh, we <em>should</em>, should we?&#x201D; Benny, the sysadmin said. He leaned over the table, with his hands clasped. &#x201C;How many SSL certs have <em>you</em> provisoned?&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;Well, a bunch, I&#x2019;ve-&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;Because <em>I</em> have, and it&#x2019;s no walk in the park, and it&#x2019;s <em>very</em> expensive.&#x201D;</p> <p>Randy blinked, and glanced over at his boss. She didn&#x2019;t have anything to add.</p> <p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s&#x2026; not true?&#x201D; Randy said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not that expensive to buy a cert, but we can also go with LetsEncrypt, which is <em>free</em>.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;Ah ha!&#x201D; Benny said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s very expensive <em>to do it right</em>. You can&#x2019;t just use some service from the Internet. We&#x2019;re here to talk about our security audit, and using LetsEncrypt is not possible. Anything hosted externally and accessible via the Internet poses a huge organizational risk. Free SSL from <em>the Internet</em> is an easy target for a hacker.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;Right,&#x201D; Randy&#x2019;s boss said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll table this for now, but it looks like we probably won&#x2019;t add SSL until we have a better sense of the costs.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;My advice is that we don&#x2019;t use SSL at all,&#x201D; Benny said. &#x201C;That will be more secure than what Randy&#x2019;s proposing.&#x201D;</p> <p>The audit happened early this year. No one has yet formulated a plan to move to SSL.</p> </div>
