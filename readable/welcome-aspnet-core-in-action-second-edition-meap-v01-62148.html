<p>Thanks for purchasing the MEAP for <i>ASP.NET Core in Action, Second Edition</i>. This book has been written to take a moderately experienced C# developer, without web development experience, to being a well-round ASP.NET Core developer, ready to build your first web applications.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The genesis of ASP.NET Core goes back several years, but I first really started paying attention shortly before the release of ASP.NET Core RC2. As an ASP.NET developer for many years, the new direction and approach to development Microsoft were embracing was a breath of fresh air. No longer are Visual Studio and Windows mandated. You are now free to build and run cross-platform .NET applications on any OS, with any IDE, and using the tools that you choose.</p> 
<p>Along with that, the entire framework is open-source, and developed with many contributions from the community. It was this aspect that drew me in initially. The ability to wade through the framework code and see how features were implemented was such a revelation (compared to the dubious documentation of old) that I was hooked!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ASP.NET Core has grown massively since its release in 2016—.NET Core 3, released in 2019, was the fastest adopted version of .NET ever. <i>ASP.NET Core in Action</i> is my attempt to get you started and productive with the latest version of the framework as soon as possible. In the first half of the book, you will work through the basics of a typical ASP.NET Core application, focusing on how to create basic web pages using Razor Pages and Web APIs using MVC controllers.</p> 
<p>In the second half, you will build on this core knowledge, looking at more advanced requirements and how to add extra features to your application. You will learn how to secure your application behind a login screen, how to handle configuration and dependency injection, and how to deploy your application to production. In the last part of the book you will look in depth at further bending the framework to your will by creating custom components.</p> 
<p>There’s already a lot of ground to cover in such a big framework, so I won’t be covering Blazor in this book, but I will be updating the book to cover .NET 5 before final publication. Your feedback is essential to creating the best book possible, so please be sure to post any comments, questions or suggestions you have about the book in the <a href="https://livebook.manning.com//book/asp-net-core-in-action-second-edition/discussion"><span>liveBook discussion forum</span></a>. I appreciate knowing where to make improvements to ensure you can get the most out of it!</p>
