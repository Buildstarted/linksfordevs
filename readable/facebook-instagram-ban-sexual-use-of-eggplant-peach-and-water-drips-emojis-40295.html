<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>KUALA LUMPUR ‚Äî Social media giants Facebook and Instagram are doing some trimming in their emoji garden in a bid to limit the use of emojis that are deemed to be sexually suggestive.</p>

<p>Following Apple‚Äôs release of new emojis with the iOS 13.2 update, Facebook, who owns Instagram, also revealed that would be banning sexually suggestive emojis.</p>

<p>The list includes the popular eggplant, peach as well as the water drips emojis.</p>

<p>The emojis, which are widely known to represent a penis (eggplant), bum (peach), and ejaculation (water drip), will still be allowed in captions, but can no longer be used in a manner that suggests anything sexual.</p>

<p>This comes after American rapper Kanye West accused the social media platforms of fuelling sex addiction and distressing married men, ‚Äúmaking them suffer like Jesus.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suffer ‚Äî and I appreciate the suffering because we can just feel a little bit of what Jesus felt when we suffer, but social media makes me suffer,‚Äù Mr West said in an interview on&nbsp;Beats1&nbsp;on Apple Music.</p><p><strong>Read also: <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/indonesia-warns-messaging-apps-drop-same-sex-emoticons?cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_03092019_todayonline"><b>Indonesia bans 'gay' emojis on messaging apps</b></a></strong></p>

<p>‚ÄúI suffer from that and by me saying this out loud, I'm sure there's other married men that suffer in a similar way that are happy to hear me say, 'Oh ya, I'm suffering,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>According to American news agency New York Post, the new rules are part of the social platforms‚Äô new community standards, which were officially enacted in September.</p>

<p>It was reported that under the new terms, pairing an eggplant or peach emoji with any sexual expressions now qualifies as ‚Äúsexual solicitation.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Read also: <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singlish-emoji-app-launched?cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_03092019_todayonline"><b>Singlish emoji app launched </b></a></strong></p>

<p>If it has been found that a user has used the emojis in a sexual manner, Facebook or Instagram would have the right to remove the post, and if it happens repeatedly, it can result in the user‚Äôs account being deactivated.</p>

<p>Nude photos where emojis cover genitalia, butts or female nipples are also now formally not allowed, as are any links or info leading to pornographic or otherwise adult material.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt taking action on simply the emojis,‚Äù an Instagram spokesperson said, according to the New York Post.</p><p><strong>Read also: <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/say-it-smiley-more-prefer-express-feelings-emojis-instead-phone-calls-study-finds?cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_03092019_todayonline"><b>Say it with a smiley: More prefer to express feelings via emojis instead of phone calls, study finds</b></a></strong></p>

<p>‚Äú(Content)&nbsp;will only be removed from Facebook and Instagram if it contains a sexual emoji alongside an implicit or indirect ask for nude imagery, sex or sexual partners, or sex chat conversations.‚Äù MALAY MAIL</p>

<p>Many social media users also took to twitter to poke fun at the new rules.</p>

<p>Twitter user Alan Boccadoro teasingly suggested that the ban opens up new opportunities for the banana, carrot, hotdog, taco and donut emojis to finally make their debut.</p>
