<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-click-id="text"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>EDIT: Gloomhaven Jaws Of The Lion</p><p>I got into board games about a year ago with Catan. I then picked up Patchwork, Secret Hitler, and Splendor (my fave) over the year. I saw on this subreddit about Gloomhaven and it was way too daunting, and there was no way I was going to convince any of my friends to play, until i heard about Jaws of the Lion.  I am an avid RPG video gamer so i was very interested, yet have never played a sophisticated board game.</p><p>I live with 3 other guys, all weight lifting, party going, frat bros that I've known for years and were all great friends, and the closest thing they have in gaming experience is COD Warzone (When they're not out partying, they're playing COD). They just got into Catan about 2 months ago and now love playing it, and then 1 of them will play Splendor every now and then, but the others think its not for them. I made them a deal that if I learned how to surf, they would have to play Gloomhaven just one evening with me.</p><p>I finally can surf after about 2 weeks and they agreed, so I picked up a copy at my Target, and then watched youtube videos for about 2 days before attempting to play.</p><p>I setup each character board, and told them to go around the table read the description of the character and if it feels "cool" to you, then play that guy, I said i would fill in the extra. They all fought to be the Red Guard, but ended up playing rock paper scissors and they each landed on a character, I ended up being Voidwarden.</p><p>After a few beers, and a few dead vermilion raiders. They understood the modifier mechanics, the attack phases, movement, line of sight, teamwork, status's, advantages/disadvantages and all the goofy little things. We finally beat the first campaign after about an hour and 20 minutes of learning.</p><p>I was exhausted from trying to describe everything, how things worked, why they worked, why it was designed that way (to the best of my ability). On the other hand, they were so HYPED, they all wanted to play the next campaign, and were talking about setting up a schedule cause they want to level their guys, and fight new monsters, get new skills and everything.</p><p>I enjoyed it for the most part, but they LOVED it.</p><p>I am learning how to set up the next campaign, and learn the next set of game mechanics that come into the game starting in campaign 2. They want to play again tonight, but I am not sure I can learn everything properly by then.</p><p>My favorite thing is we wake up this morning, and they are like "sup red knight" passing by in the kitchen, "oh demolition dave finally woke up". It was wholesome. Their only gripe was, "No social media, this is probably the nerdiest thing I've ever done, but I love it".</p><p>So all in all, I think Gloomhaven Jaws of the Lion paved a path to get into the full game with my roommates that have never board gamed really. If my non-board gamer friends can learn this game, I think almost anyone can. It's super fun, and I think any other game after this will have a smaller learning curve.</p><p>Just wanted to share my experience if anyone else is daunted by Gloomhaven or just wants to listen :).</p><p>P.S.</p><p>If anyone knows a good way to store the game, or containers i can buy to help organize the game better, please let me know. There are a lot of pieces and it was hard to get the box closed last night.</p><p>Also if there are ways to make the pieces last longer, I feel like the cards are going to get a lot of wear and tear from constantly being used.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
