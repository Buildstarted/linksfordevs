<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span face="Verdana">Hello everyone, I am the Lead Architect of the&nbsp;CLR/UIFX group&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Chief Architect of the .NET Frameworks. &nbsp;I was thinking about what I should put in the first entry of my blog… as one of the founders of the CLR I thought it would be interesting to give you some history of how CLR was born in my blog’s intro entry. </span></p>

<p><span face="Verdana">Before the CLR I was working on JVM. When Mike Toutonghi, Peter Kukol, Anders Hejlsberg, and I realized that the JVM would not give us the flexibility to innovate in the places we cared about - support for other languages, deep interop with COM and unmanaged code, extensive frameworks to expose MS technology - we decided to join force with the COM team and form a new group, &nbsp;tentatively named COM 2.0. </span></p>

<p><span face="Verdana">We soon&nbsp;disagreed about object management, specifically about explicit management like COM (AddRef/Release) versus automatic management (Garbage Collection), we decided to form 2 groups: COM+ and CLR. This marked the birth of the CLR group.</span></p>

<p><span face="Verdana">Early on, we were joined by a meta data group who had been prototyping some meta data schema for the C++ compiler. Peter Kukol and the C++ group collaborated on the IL instruction set. I designed&nbsp;the architecture of&nbsp;the&nbsp;runtime&nbsp;and wrote the Garbage Collector (and yes the GC prototype was&nbsp;was written in Common Lisp first and I wrote a translator to convert it to C++).</span></p>

<p><span face="Verdana">Soon we had all the fundamental components of a runtime, some runtime helpers for the base classes (String and Object), and a new cool language: C#. We were in the business to build the full fledge CLR and the Framework. </span></p>

<p><span face="Verdana">So there you go, for those curious minds this is how CLR was started.</span></p>

<p><span face="Verdana">In the next blog entry I will be writing about server modeling. Also feel free to let me know if there are specific topics you want to see me write about.</span></p></div></div></div>
