    <div><div id="article-image"> <img id="ContentPlaceHolder1_ucArticle_imgImage" src="https://i.nextmedia.com.au/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https%3a%2f%2fi.nextmedia.com.au%2fNews%2fCRN-690-Toll-pm-news-1213-toll530.jpg&amp;w=480&amp;c=0&amp;s=1" alt="Toll Group tight-lipped on alleged ransomware attack"> <meta> <meta> <meta> </div><div id="article-body"> <p>Toll Group is staying tight-lipped on what appears to be a large-scale ransomware attack that has infected a sizable part of its IT infrastructure.</p> <p><a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/toll-group-shuts-it-systems-after-cyber-security-incident-537401">The logistics giant first reported</a> that it was suffering from the effects of a &#x201C;cyber security incident&#x201D; on Friday last week.</p> <p>That continued into this week with pickup and tracking systems, including its MyToll portal, offline.&#xA0;</p> <p><a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/toll-group-confirms-targeted-ransomware-attack-537494"><strong>Read the latest: Toll Group confirms &quot;targeted&quot; ransomware attack</strong></a></p> <p>A support line for MyToll reached by<em> iTnews</em> on Monday afternoon said it was &#x201C;closed&#x201D; and to email instead.</p> <p>The company said in a statement that &#x201C;as a precautionary measure, in response to a cybersecurity incident on Friday, Toll deliberately shut down a number of systems across multiple sites and business units.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x201C;Toll IT teams are working closely with global cyber security experts to resolve the issue,&#x201D; it said.</p> <p>&#x201C;Our immediate focus is on bringing our systems back online in a controlled and secure manner.&#x201D;</p> <p>A source with knowledge of the incident told <em>iTnews</em> that the company has been hit with a sizable ransomware infection that is impacting global operations.</p> <p>The source said that over 1000 servers had been infected, and that staff worldwide had been told to leave desktops and laptops switched off and disconnected from the corporate network.</p> <p>The source said Active Directory, productivity and corporate VPN applications were among those infected and taken offline.</p> <p>This appears to mesh with other reports of the incident sighted by <em>iTnews</em>, which claimed ransomware had infected systems in Toll&#x2019;s main data centre; that the company had no IT systems operating; and that it was in the process of manually cleaning servers in an effort to bring them back online.</p> <p><em>iTnews</em> put its understanding of the incident to Toll Group&#x2019;s media representatives on Monday.&#xA0;</p> <p>The company responded with a prepared statement that did not address any of the points.</p> <p>It did not further respond to follow-up emails and calls made to several media representatives.</p> <p>Toll Group&#x2019;s IT operating model includes a sizable workforce outsourced to Infosys.</p> <p>An Australian spokesperson for Infosys declined to comment on the incident, including whether its teams were involved in the recovery.</p> <p>&#x201C;As a matter of corporate policy, Infosys does not comment on client matters,&#x201D; its spokesperson said.</p> <p>Toll said it was &#x201C;making progress&#x201D; in its recovery efforts.</p> <p>&#x201C;Staying focused on customers remains at the forefront of Toll&#x2019;s priorities as we restore our services and we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused,&#x201D; it said.</p> <p>&#x201C;We want to thank our customers for their patience and support.&#x201D;</p> <p>Ransomware has been back in the spotlight in the early part of 2020 with high-profile attacks such as on <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/travelex-recovers-uk-website-after-ransomware-hit-537381">foreign exchange firm Travelex</a>, which took the best part of a month to recover from. Travelex has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/01/09/travelex-refuses-say-paid-6m-ransom-hackers/">refused to say publicly</a> if it paid the $9 million ransom or not.</p> <p>Total losses from malware can be much more substantial, however. A Petya malware infection <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/tnt-express-pegs-petya-losses-at-374m-473837">cost fellow logistics firm TNT Express $374 million</a>, while staff at law firm DLA Piper put in <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/dla-piper-paid-15000-hours-of-it-overtime-after-notpetya-attack-490495">15,000 hours of overtime</a> to recover from an encounter with the same piece of malware.</p> </div></div>
