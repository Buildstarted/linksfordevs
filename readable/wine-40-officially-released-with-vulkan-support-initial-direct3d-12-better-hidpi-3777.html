<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&amp;q=Wine%204.0">Wine 4.0</a> is now officially available as the new annual stable release to Wine for running Windows programs and games on Linux and other operating systems.
</p><p>
Following seven weekly release candidates, Wine 4.0 was ready to ship today as judged by Wine founder Alexandre Julliard. Wine 4.0 is a big release bringing initial Vulkan graphics API support, Direct3D CSMT is enabled by default, early Direct3D 12 support via VKD3D, continued HiDPI work, various OpenGL improvements, multi-sample D3D texture support, 64-bit improvements, continued Android support, and much more...

The very brief Wine 4.0 release announcement can be read on <a href="https://www.winehq.org/news/2019012201">WineHQ.org</a>.
</p><p>
The bi-weekly Wine 4.x development releases will now commence with Git master back open for feature development, culminating with Wine 5.0 next year. Hopefully Valve's Proton will soon be re-based to the current Wine 4.0 state.</p></div></div></div>
