<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h4>(No, this isn’t a political statement)</h4><h4>July 17th, 2020</h4></p><div><p>As a member of the hyped-up Gen Z, you’d think I’d be an expert on TikTok. But no, I only downloaded it this week because I heard it might be taken down soon.</p>
<p>It turns out TikTok is kinda cool. That’s not to say I think it should or shouldn’t get banned, but it’s easy to see the appeal after a week of using it. </p>
<p>And ironically, TikTok is a lot more democratic than a lot of other social networks.</p>

<p>Partly, because of the shared toolkit.</p>
<p>On Instagram, the 3rd party toolkit ranges from airbrush apps to After Effects.
On Youtube you have kids using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKfS5zVfGBc">unregistered HyperCam 2’s</a> pitted against aspiring Jake Paul’s using Adobe Premiere.</p>
<p>But on TikTok, almost all videos are filmed on mobile devices and edited in the app itself. You can’t assume much based on a thumbnail or the production quality of a clip.</p>
<p>This means I can put less effort + time into production quality and making sure my videos meet at a base standard. <strong>The friction from idea to delivered video is significantly less</strong> on TikTok vs. the other two platforms.</p>

<p>Then there’s the infinite scroll governed by <em>the algorithm</em>.</p>
<p>Every major social network has one of these algorithms, and they all seem to be equally mysterious. Your entire future might be decided by a set of ever-changing if’s and else’s written in SV or Beijing.</p>
<p>And while most platforms use their feed algorithms to maximize engagement, TikTok uses it to maximize meme discovery.†</p>
<p>Can I compete against Addison Rae’s profile? Probably not, but apparently you can sneak in a lot more dancing Chilean software engineers on my TikTok Feed than my IG Explore feed. If social media is a status game, putting players on equal footing is just about the greatest thing you can do for engagement. And really, <strong>you only have to make people think they have a chance</strong>.</p>

<p>So the common theme here is that TikTok did one thing really well: create an efficient meme factory. <strong>The conversion from idea to meme is near-frictionless. The distribution of your newly created meme is effortless.</strong> No need to growth hack with suggestive thumbnails and follow-4-follow’s, just let the algorithm run its course.</p>
<p>Rather than let attention follow a power-law distribution, <strong>TikTok democratized attention</strong> and memes.</p>
<p>And while I’m no advocate for fallible centralized systems (the Algorithm controls enough about our lives as is), it’s a damn good way to grow a social network.</p>

<p>As a side note, some of my friends work on Instagram’s algorithms. I've seen the work Facebook is putting into similar efforts. But now I’m forced to see Instagram as a dying network. A culture built on flexing* and highlighting your best moments can’t compete against a culture that embraces mass-participation and sharing everyday living. </p>
<p>Just ask yourself, in our brave new post-flex world, where will you turn to find relatable content?</p>

<p>† Of course, this is all assuming the algorithm isn’t compromised. The risk of bad actors abusing it in order to subtly influence us and our youth is real.</p>
<p>* Because of all this Covid-19 funny business, we may very well be entering into a post-flex era of social media. This might be what finally changes Instagram’s culture. So either we slowly turn our main Instagrams into our Finstas, or Instagram will become a place dominated by shitty FuckJerry accounts and generic aesthetic pictures. So basically, an inferior blend of Pinterest and Twitter.</p></div></div></div>
