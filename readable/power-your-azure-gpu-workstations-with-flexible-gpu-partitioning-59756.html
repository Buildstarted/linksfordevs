                        <p>Today we're sharing the general availability of NVv4 virtual machines in South Central US, East US, and West Europe regions, with additional regions planned in the coming months. With NVv4, Azure is the first public cloud to offer GPU partitioning built on industry-standard SR-IOV technology.</p>

<p>NVv4 VMs feature AMD’s <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/professional-graphics/instinct-mi25" target="_blank" data-event="page-clicked-link" data-bi-id="page-clicked-link" data-bi-area="content">Radeon Instinct MI25</a> GPU, up to 32 AMD <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/processors/epyc-7002-series" target="_blank" data-event="page-clicked-link" data-bi-id="page-clicked-link" data-bi-area="content">EPYC™</a> 7002-series vCPUs with clock frequencies up to 3.3 GHz, 112 GB of RAM, 480 MB of L3 cache, and simultaneous multithreading (SMT).</p>

One- and three-year Reserved Instance and Spot Pricing for NVv4 VMs will be available on April 1. Support for Linux will be available soon.</p>

<h2>Affordable, modern GPU powered virtual desktops in the cloud</h2>

<p>As enterprises look to the cloud to provide virtual desktops and workstations in a secure way to a highly mobile workforce, they face the significant challenge of managing cost and performance while meeting user experience expectations. Traditionally, public clouds offered virtual machines with one or more GPUs, which are best suited for the most GPU intensive workloads that required the full power and resources of a GPU. But for the regular knowledge worker profile, a full GPU could be overkill. For some of these customers, multi-session virtual desktops like those offered by <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/" target="_blank" data-event="page-clicked-link" data-bi-id="page-clicked-link" data-bi-area="content">Windows Virtual Desktop</a> fit the bill, by letting concurrent sessions share the GPU dynamically. However, some VDI customers need a dedicated virtual machine (VM) per user, either for performance or isolation reasons. For these kinds of workloads, customers are looking for a scale-down option to choose the right GPU size to meet the requirements.</p>

<p>Our customers needed cost-effective VM options that are sized appropriately with dedicated GPU resources for each user, starting from office workers running productivity apps to engineering workstations running GPU-powered workloads such as CAD, gaming, and simulation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“With the new AMD-powered Workspot cloud desktops on Azure, we now have several perfectly sized cloud workstations for our different workloads. We’ve found the new entry level cloud workstation, using a fraction of the AMD GPU, is just right for our users running Microsoft Office 365 productivity tools and Adobe design tools (Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign). This fills in an additional much-needed point on the price/performance curve, which allows us to move even more users to the AMD-powered Workspot cloud desktops on Azure.” Andy Knauf, CIO, Mead &amp; Hunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Pick the right GPU virtual machine size for the VDI user profile</h2>

<p>The NVv4 virtual machine series is designed specifically for the cloud virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and the desktop-as-a-service (DaaS) markets. We wanted to bring GPU processing power to the masses by putting a slice of the GPU in every desktop in the cloud. NVv4 enables enterprises to provide modern desktops in the cloud, with the ideal balance of price and performance for their workloads.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows how the different VM sizes align with the different VDI user profiles and requirements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Based on the application requirements of each engineer, we can dedicate all or a fraction of the AMD GPU to their Workspot workstation on Azure. This finer resolution of control gives us the financial edge we need to move more people to Workspot cloud desktops on Azure and increase our overall productivity.”&nbsp; Eric Quinn, CTO, C&amp;S Companies.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Predictable performance and security with hardware partitioning of the GPU</h2>

<p>In Azure, the security of the customer's workload is always a top priority. SR-IOV based GPU partitioning provides a strong, hardware-backed security boundary with predictable performance for each virtual machine. We partition a single AMD Radeon Instinct MI 25 GPU and allocate it up to eight virtual machines. Each virtual machine can only access the GPU resources dedicated to them and the secure hardware partitioning prevents unauthorized access by other VMs.</p>

<h2>Designed to work with Windows Virtual Desktop and VDI partners you use today</h2>

<p>Customers in the VDI segment have many choices for remote protocol and infrastructure management. We worked closely with the key partners to ensure support for NVv4 virtual machines.</p>

<p>Windows Virtual Desktop supports the new NVv4 virtual machines with native WVD deployments that use RDP as well as solutions delivered by Citrix and VMware, our approved providers.</p>

<p>NVv4 virtual machines support Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Teradici PCoIP, and HDX 3D Pro. The graphics API support covers DirectX 9 through 12, OpenGL 4.6, and Vulkan 1.1.</p>
