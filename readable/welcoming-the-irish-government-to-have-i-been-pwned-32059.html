            <p>Over the last year and a bit <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-uk-and-australian-governments-are-now-monitoring-their-gov-domains-on-have-i-been-pwned/">I've been working to make more data in HIBP freely available to governments around the world</a> that want to monitor their own exposure in data breaches. Like the rest of us, governments regularly rely on services that fall victim to attacks resulting in data being disclosed and just like the commercial organisations monitoring domains on HIBP, understanding that exposure is important. To date, the UK, Australian, Spanish and Austrian governments have come onboard HIBP for nation-wide government domain monitoring and today, I'm happy to welcome the Irish government as well. They now have access to all .gov.ie domains and a handful of other government ones on different TLDs.</p><p>A big welcome to the Irish National Cyber Security Centre!</p>
