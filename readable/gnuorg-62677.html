<h2>Teaching My MIT Classes with Only Free/Libre Software</h2>


<hr>

<div>

<p>This spring (2020) MIT moved all its classes online 
because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  It made available 
licenses for various nonfree programs, but I objected 
to them on grounds of principle.  For my class, an 
advanced class in computer programming, I made 
arrangements to avoid suggesting any nonfree software 
to my students.</p>

<p>Instead, I used an installation of BigBlueButton 
running on a server owned by the Free Software Foundation.  
Rubén Rodriguez of the FSF helped get this and other 
software working.  (Thank you, FSF and Rubén!)</p>

<p>The class used a draft textbook that Chris Hanson and 
I have written.  The book is entitled “Software Design 
for Flexibility (how to avoid programming yourself into 
a corner)”; it will be published by MIT Press soon, with 
a Creative Commons Share Alike license (and all the
code in support of the book is under the GNU GPL).</p>

<p>I also did not ask my students to use nonfree software 
for one-on-one conversations about classwork, or thesis 
work, or projects.  I used a Jitsi Meet server that I 
installed on an obsolete and otherwise useless computer 
that was sitting idle in my laboratory, on its way to the 
electronics junk heap.</p>

<p>I am pleased to report that my classes were successfully 
presented, my students were well served, and we were all 
reasonably happy with the results.</p>

<p>The one flaw that the server software still has is that 
Jitsi Meet and BigBlueButton don't indicate for <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> that their JavaScript 
code is free.  It IS free—its source code is clearly 
licensed—but LibreJS can't determine this automatically.</p>
