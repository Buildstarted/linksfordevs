Additional information on the award can be found here, and the following statement can be attributed to SpaceX President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell.</p><p>“SpaceX is honored to continue supporting NASA’s critical scientific observational missions by launching PACE, which will help humanity better understand, protect, and preserve our planet.”</p><p>SpaceX has completed 82 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy missions to-date, including two for NASA’s LSP – Jason-3 and TESS. In addition to PACE, SpaceX’s future launch manifest includes NASA’s LSP missions SWOT, Sentinel-6A, DART, and IXPE.</p></div>

<div id="msg_2042395"><blockquote>The total cost for NASA to launch PACE is approximately $80.4 million, which includes the launch service and other mission related costs.</blockquote><p>Even with "other mission related costs", I would imagine that SpaceX will make a large profit on this flight even though I also imagine that they had the lowest bid. Putting a 1700 kg satellite into a sun-synchronous orbit, even from <del>Canvera</del>l (edit; OK, that might be hard; certainly it'd be easy from Vandenberg) seems like a softball for them and (I'm guessing) it will be a return-to-launch-site mission.</p><p>Not that I'm complaining, even as a US taxpayer. I'd like to see beyond earth orbit human exploration and IMO I get better bang-for-the buck having the US Govt give money straight to SpaceX, than spending it themselves trying to accomplish lesser and more expensive BEO objectives. Such is the world we live in....</p></div>

<div id="msg_2042400"><p>This was in the 2019 GAO assessment of major NASA projects:</p><blockquote>Launch<br>The PACE project is continuing to pursue a shared ride agreement with the Air Force, which could help to mitigate a launch vehicle risk that the project is tracking. The launch vehicle cost remains one of the project’s top risks, which could cause the project to exceed the $705 million allocated to the project or have to reduce its science capabilities. The project has $105 million budgeted toward the launch vehicle, but officials say a rideshare would significantly reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force have determined there is a path for a shared launch vehicle procurement, but no partner mission has been identified. The project currently plans to begin the procurement process in early 2019 and award the launch vehicle contract in November 2019.</blockquote></div>

If NASA permits SpaceX to sell the residual capacity under their smallsat program, the main satellite should have roughly the same $/kg. <br>$50mln/1700kg gives ~29,4K $/kg. <br>That's nearly six times the smallsat program fare. </p><p>Could this possibly have something to do with launching from Vandenberg instead of the East coast?<br>[No, Multiple sources state it will launch from Cape Canaveral.]</p><p>In Europe launch orders are delayed so Vega-C and Ariane 6 can prove themselves with their maiden launch.

<div id="msg_2042673"><blockquote>In Europe launch orders are delayed so Vega-C and Ariane 6 can prove themselves with their maiden launch. (Sentinel C &amp; D's) Why doesn't this happen in the US?</blockquote><p>I'm not aware of any US launch vehicles nearing the end of development that would be suitable for this payload?&nbsp; If NASA is paying for the launch then it's going on a US vehicle.&nbsp; If ESA or JAXA were partnering on the mission then there might be other options like Vega-C or H-3.</p></div>

<p>There's no current or soon to be available competition in the domestic market for this launch class. The upcoming small satellite launchers are too small.</p>
