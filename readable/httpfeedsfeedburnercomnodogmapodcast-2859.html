        <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Mark Eisenberg discusses why enterprises should adopt microservices, what is stopping them, and how they can overcome those problems.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p>Who he is, what he does. Mark's interest in microservices. What a microservice is, why it is important, why it is difficult; what he means by "enterprise". What enterprises are currently doing - using new technology in an old way. Are enterprises changing for the wrong reasons; what are the right reasons - "fear". Time to market and scale is very short, think of Uber, Airbnb, etc. Product Enterprises don't always see the threat that is coming. Changes needed - culture, support from business units, CI/CD, build security in from start, cloud is not necessary, Jez Humble's book Accelerate, everything has to change. Better, faster, cheaper is what the execs are interested. Microsoft's recommendations on getting microservices into the enterprise. Concrete steps an enterprise can take - training, developers should be driving the change. Don't start with "can't", focus on what and why.</p>

        <p> <strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Jeff Glennon used to be an agile consultant helping companies align their departments to deliver better software, but he left that world behind and is now the Chief Operations Officer at Night Shift Distributing, a distributor of craft beers and other beverages in Massachusetts. Jeff talks to me about his move, the skills he brought with him and what he has learned.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p>What he used to do, moving to Nightshift Brewing, bringing his skills from the software world. Setting goals, doing it as a team, "commitments", scaling, going beyond the local customers, opening another location. Being the chief operating officer and leading sales at same time. Differences and similarities between agile consulting and role as COO.<br>
An agile approach to beer distribution, partnering with their customers, when to drop a partner.<br>
Scaling problems, logistical challenges, capital investments, big decisions affect many families, how they make big decisions, strategy is a day to day and week to week thing. Three to five year plan. It's not lines of code it's beer, the similarities between the software and beer worlds. What he has learned in two years, "the value of stopping for a second", saying no and letting people challenge you is important. Jeff doesn't plan to go back to tech. "It's just beer"</p>

<p>Who he is, what he does, working on Bing lead to the book, Bing is probably the biggest C# app in the world. Why worry about performance, pay for play, serverless; sometimes more machines are the best solution. Where to start with the CLR, the garbage collector, JIT, be careful of enum flags. More on GC, using generations to improve efficiency, aim for very short lived or very long-lived memory, memory efficiency is as important as CPU efficiency. What about the network, async await all the way down, Ben likes TPL, "immutability is key". LINQ hides allocations, closures delegates. Be careful with Func and Actions, delegates cause allocations. Spans. Concurrent collections. Just in Time, small methods compile faster, Bing loads thousands of dlls. Readability and maintainability vs performance. for vs foreach.</p>

<p>Who he is, what he does. What is a monolith, tell-tale signs of a monolith, coupling and decoupling. Why we built monoliths. N-tiers and monoliths. Software is rarely a green field. Were we ever able to swap tiers. Advantages of a monolith, it's familiar. Companies need a visionary to effect change. Risk raises its head. SOA didn't work, client server didn't work, n-tier didn't work. Successful companies went from monoliths to microservices when they needed to. RPC is from the 1960s, are you running one piece of code on one machine or ten machines. How to get off the monolith, find a visionary. Time to respond to a challenge is very short.

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p>Who he is and what he does, Mads and the other guy, cross platform experience, playing guitar. Why move to incremental c# releases, bug fixes, move language forward more quickly, csharplang on GitHub, changes needed to compiler, C# releases are tied to Visual Studio releases. Could C# become a NuGet package. Preventing accidental use of 7.1. Possible dates. Release cadence, halting problem. Speed of change of c# vs ASP.Net, slow evolution is the plan. Balancing features and performance against ease of use. More pattern types coming. Shapes and extensions, extension everything - properties, constructors. Optional interfaces. The future of c#.

<p>David Mead of Start With Why talks about improving communication skills, leadership and handling conflict.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p>Simon Sinek and start with why, David's own background. Start with why, golden circle. What we do, how we do it, why we do it; without why it is much harder to differentiate ourselves. Most companies start with what, examples of companies that start with why. People like to be around people like them and believe what they believe. Imperfect companies can have a nobel higher goal.<br>
How can engineers improve their communication; it's a skill that can be learned; give people tasks and roles that inspire. Better communication across the whole organization, sharing the big picture. Simple tips to improve communication skills, set goals that are attainable with low risk. How to handle conflict, don't take a position against something, stand for something. Conflict as a useful tool to resolve issues. What to do if conflict has become the norm, get back to the why; what to do when the why is not enough, "we can't fix people, we can provide the environment where they can be inspired to change themselves". Don't promote because of skill; when leading a team you are responsible for the team not the job, "management is about getting stuff done, leadership is about people". Always keep an eye on the bigger picture.</p>

"Infrastructure changes", very hard to keep up, big companies telling small companies that they are doing things wrong. "The year of AI", again; AI silos, no overarching system.

<p>Who he is. What he does. His first games was in BASIC. What Disbelief does. "A game is a piece of art that can move". Game dev is iterative and never the vision of one person, why it is thought to be that way. The visionary is more of a guide, deciding what to include and exclude. Hundreds of people involved. Using game engines. Prototyping, "made four games and shipped one". Avoiding "group think". Sequels are common, holding back features. Sharing ideas between devs and companies. What happens after prototyping - playing end to end, the doldrums, getting it back together, closing stages, technical debt, making a product. How long a game takes to make. Specialized work of Disbelief, frame rates, VR. Disbelief is hiring in Boston and Chicago.</p>
