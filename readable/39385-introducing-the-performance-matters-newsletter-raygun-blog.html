The good news is that there are companies who have achieved their performance goals — and more. There’s a lot to learn from juggernauts like <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog" target="_blank">Netflix</a>, but also the lesser-known performance pioneers breaking the boundaries of what we thought possible.</p><p>That’s why we’re launching <a href="https://performancematters.dev/" target="_blank">Performance Matters</a> - a weekly email curation of software performance news and inspiration delivered to you, the tech leader, every week.</p><p>Here are a few reasons why you should subscribe.</p><p>We’ve noticed an uptick in software professionals talking about software quality and performance. As an industry, we’re starting to ask how we can measure software quality and what that might look like in a high-performing team. With Performance Matters, we want to add fuel to that conversation.</p><p>At <a href="https://raygun.com" target="_blank">Raygun</a>, we care about performance. Articles are suggested by both our existing community and our internal team, and sometimes our CEO joins in!</p><p><img src="/blog/images/performance-matters/screenshot.png" alt="Performance Matters"></p><h4 id="3-software-performance-really-does-matter">3) Software performance really does matter</h4><p>Bugs and poorly performing software has a genuine impact on the world way beyond the customer experience. We want to see you meet your software performance goals.</p><h4 id="4-tips-and-tricks-aren-t-helpful">4) Tips and tricks aren’t helpful</h4><p>Today’s tech leaders need frameworks, strategies, and new ways of thinking to thrive in a competitive environment. Our newsletter focuses exclusively on the above - it’s a zero-fluff read.</p><p>So, if you’re just as passionate about software performance as us, <a href="https://performancematters.dev/" target="_blank">subscribe here</a>, and if you have a suggestion, send us an email at <strong>hello@performancematters.dev</strong>.</p></div></div></div></div>
