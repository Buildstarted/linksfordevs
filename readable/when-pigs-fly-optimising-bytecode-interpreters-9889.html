Our ‚Äúpig‚Äù only understands one kind of data ‚Äî a 64-bit word ‚Äî and performs all calculations (involving integers only) on a stack with a maximum depth of 256 words.

On that basis, we decided to go with a pig assembler language.</p><p id="02df" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is what the program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 65,536 looks like in the assembler language:</p><pre><span id="522e" data-selectable-paragraph=""># sum numbers from 1 to 65535</span><span id="f917" data-selectable-paragraph=""># init the current sum and the index<br>PUSHI 1<br>PUSHI 1<br># stack s=1, i=1<br>STOREI 0<br># stack: s=1</span><span id="d960" data-selectable-paragraph=""># routine: increment the counter, add it to the current sum<br>incrementandadd:</span><span id="cf1a" data-selectable-paragraph=""># check if index is too big<br>LOADI 0<br># stack: s, i<br>ADDI 1<br># stack: s, i+1<br>DUP<br># stack: s, i+1, i+1<br>GREATER_OR_EQUALI 65535<br># stack: s, i+1, 1 or 0<br>JUMP_IF_TRUE done<br># stack: s, i+1<br>DUP<br># stack: s, i+1, i+1<br>STOREI 0<br># stack: s, i+1<br>ADD<br># stack: s+i+1<br>JUMP incrementandadd</span><span id="496a" data-selectable-paragraph="">done:<br>DISCARD<br>PRINT<br>DONE</span></pre><p id="b0ee" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is not Python, of course, but we have everything here that you‚Äôd need to make a pig happy: comments, labels, conditional and unconditional transitions between them, mnemonics for instructions and the option of specifying direct arguments for instructions.</p><p id="f9fa" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Piglet Machine comes with an assembler and a disassembler, which brave readers with a lot of free time on their hands can try out for themselves.</p><p id="f2c0" data-selectable-paragraph="">The numbers add up very quickly, so I wrote another program to test productivity: a na√Øve implementation of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>.</p><p id="582d" data-selectable-paragraph="">In actual fact the pig is able to run quite fast on its own (its instructions are close to machine instructions), so in order to obtain clear results, I am going to perform each measurement for a hundred program launches.</p><p id="cb5c" data-selectable-paragraph="">The first version of our non-optimised pig runs something like this:</p><pre><span id="518c" data-selectable-paragraph="">&gt; ./pigletvm runtimes test/sieve-unoptimized.bin 100 &gt; /dev/null<br>PROFILE: switch code finished took 545ms</span></pre><p id="ec43" data-selectable-paragraph="">Half a second!

The second rule of fast code is never to do any extra work. So, what is the extra work the Piglet Machine‚Äôs doing?</p><p id="1673" data-selectable-paragraph="">Observation one: the profiling for our program reveals that there is one particular sequence of instructions that we encounter more often than others. Let‚Äôs not torture our pig and limit ourselves to just a couple of instructions:</p><ol><li id="6563" data-selectable-paragraph="">LOADI 0, ADD ‚Äî push a number from the memory to the stack, mapping it to 0, and add it to the number at the top of the stack.</li><li id="605f" data-selectable-paragraph="">PUSHI 65536, GREATER_OR_EQUAL ‚Äî push a number to the stack and compare it with the number which was previously at the top of the stack, pushing the result of the comparison (0 or 1) back to the stack.</li><li id="99de" data-selectable-paragraph="">PUSHI 1, ADD ‚Äî push a number to the stack, add it to the number which was previously at the top of the stack, and push the resulting sum back to the stack.</li></ol><p id="d841" data-selectable-paragraph="">Our Piglet Machine has just over 20 instructions. We represent every instruction using a single byte, which means we have 256 possible instruction codes. Introducing new instructions isn‚Äôt a problem, so that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll do:</p><pre><span id="a0ca" data-selectable-paragraph="">for (;;) {<br>    uint8_t instruction = NEXT_OP();<br>    switch (instruction) {<br>    /*<br>     * Other instructions here<br>     * */<br>    case OP_LOADADDI: {<br>        /* get immediate argument as an memory address , add it to value from the address to the top<br>         * of the stack */<br>        uint16_t addr = NEXT_ARG();<br>        uint64_t val = vm.memory[addr];<br>        *TOS_PTR() += val;<br>        break;<br>    }<br>    case OP_GREATER_OR_EQUALI:{<br>        /* get the immediate argument, compare it with the value from the address to the top of the stack */<br>        uint64_t arg_right = NEXT_ARG();<br>        *TOS_PTR() = PEEK() &gt;= arg_right;<br>        break;<br>    }<br>    case OP_ADDI: {<br>        /* Add immediate value to the top of the stack */<br>        uint16_t arg_right = NEXT_ARG();<br>        *TOS_PTR() += arg_right;<br>        break;<br>    }<br>    /*<br>     * Other instructions here<br>     * */<br>}</span></pre><p id="a72d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Nothing complicated here. Let‚Äôs see what the outcome is:</p><pre><span id="10cc" data-selectable-paragraph="">&gt; ./pigletvm runtimes test/sieve.bin 100 &gt; /dev/null<br>PROFILE: switch code finished took 410ms</span></pre><p id="7c50" data-selectable-paragraph="">Wow! Only three new instructions in the code and yet we‚Äôve ‚Äúwon‚Äù ourselves 150 or so milliseconds!</p><p id="ff79" data-selectable-paragraph="">The gains achieved here are thanks to the fact that our piglet, when performing these instructions, isn‚Äôt performing any extra moves: the execution thread isn‚Äôt straying into the main loop, there isn‚Äôt anything extra being decoded and the arguments for instructions are not being sent through the stack again unnecessarily.</p><p id="6997" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is what we call static superinstructions, since additional instructions are determined statically ‚Äî that is to say, by the virtual machine programmer at the development stage. This is a simple and effective technique which, in one way or another, all programming language virtual machines use.</p><p id="6ddb" data-selectable-paragraph="">The main problem in the case of static superinstructions is that, without a specific program, it isn‚Äôt possible to determine which particular instructions should be combined. Various programs use various sequences of instructions, and these sequences can only be found out once you run a given code.</p><p id="62be" data-selectable-paragraph="">The next step could have been the dynamic compilation of superinstructions within the context of a particular program, that is to say dynamic superinstructions. In the 90s and the early 2000s, this technique was used in primitive JIT compilers. However, it‚Äôs a lengthy step, so we‚Äôll be skipping it this time.</p><p id="74b6" data-selectable-paragraph="">Normal –° doesn‚Äôt allow you to create instructions ‚Äòon the go‚Äô, and our piglet is within its rights not to consider this a fair contest. Fortunately, I have a couple of better exercises for it.</p><p id="37ae" data-selectable-paragraph="">According to our rules for fast code, let‚Äôs ask that age-old question once again: what can we NOT do?</p><p id="4795" data-selectable-paragraph="">When we were first introduced to the set up for the Piglet Machine, I listed off all the actions a virtual machine performs for each opcode. And point 2 (checking whether the opcode value fits into the permissible interval of switch values) is the one which raises the most questions.</p><p id="9ecb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let‚Äôs look more closely at how GCC compiles the switch construction:</p><ol><li id="4982" data-selectable-paragraph="">A transitions table is built, that is to say a table which displays the opcode value, mapping it to the code which executes the instruction body;</li><li id="850a" data-selectable-paragraph="">The code is inserted, checking whether the opcode obtained fits into the interval for all possible switch values, and sends it to the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù label if there is no handler for the opcode;</li><li id="15c0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Code is inserted which transitions to the handler.</li></ol><p id="026d" data-selectable-paragraph="">But why perform a value interval check for each instruction? We consider that the opcode is either correct (terminating execution by means of an OP_DONE instruction) or incorrect, straying outside bytecode. The tail of the opcode stream is marked by a zero, and zero is the opcode for the OP_ABORT instruction, which terminates execution of the bytecode with an error.</p><p id="cf0b" data-selectable-paragraph="">It turns out that this check isn‚Äôt needed at all! And the piglet must be able to communicate this to the compiler. Let‚Äôs try to correct the main switch a little:</p><pre><span id="bcb5" data-selectable-paragraph="">uint8_t instruction = NEXT_OP();<br>/* Let the compiler know that opcodes are always between 0 and 31 */<br>switch (instruction &amp; 0x1f) {<br>   /* All the instructions here */<br>   case 26 ... 0x1f: {<br>       /*Handle the remaining 5 non-existing opcodes*/<br>       return ERROR_UNKNOWN_OPCODE;<br>   }<br>}</span></pre><p id="4824" data-selectable-paragraph="">Knowing that we only have 26 instructions, we use a bitmask (hexadecimal value 0x1f ‚Äî this is binary 0b11111, covering the values interval from 0 to 31) on the opcode and add handlers for unused values in the interval from 26 to 31.</p><p id="17b2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Bit instructions are some of the cheapest in the x86 architecture, and they are definitely cheaper than problematic conditional transitions along the lines of the one used by the values interval check. Theoretically, we should be able to win several cycles for each instruction due to be performed, if the compiler gets our hint.</p><p id="75c3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Incidentally, the means for specifying the values interval in ‚Äòcase‚Äô is not standard C, but a GCC extension. However, for our purposes this code will do, especially since it isn‚Äôt complicated to redo it for several handlers for each of the unnecessary values.</p><p id="090b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let‚Äôs give it a try:</p><pre><span id="3a50" data-selectable-paragraph="">&gt; ./pigletvm runtimes test/sieve.bin 100 &gt; /dev/null<br>PROFILE: switch code finished took 437ms<br>PROFILE: switch code (no range check) finished took 383ms</span></pre><p id="4cb1" data-selectable-paragraph="">Another 50 milliseconds! Piglet, it‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre starting to get into shape!</p><p id="0cd7" data-selectable-paragraph="">What other exercises might help our piglet out? The greatest time savings were achieved thanks to superinstructions. They reduce instances of interaction with the main loop and allow you to cut out associated overheads.</p><p id="0cc5" data-selectable-paragraph="">The central switch is the main problem area for any processor that‚Äôs executing instructions out of order. Contemporary branch predictors have learnt how to predict even such complex indirect transitions and are now not bad at doing so, but spreading branch points throughout the code could help the processor to transition quickly from one instruction to another.</p><p id="c55b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Another problem is the byte-by-byte reading of opcodes for instructions and direct arguments from the bytecode. Hardware machines operate using a 64-bit machine word and don‚Äôt like it very much when the code operates using lower values.</p><p id="f73b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Compilers often operate using<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> basic blocks (BB)</a>, that is to say sequences of instructions without internal branches or labels. A basic block starts either from the start of a program or from a label, and finishes at the end of a program, a conditional branch or a direct jump to a label beginning the next basic block.</p><p id="93ab" data-selectable-paragraph="">There are lots of advantages to working with basic blocks, but our pig is specifically interested in its key distinguishing feature, namely that instructions within the scope of a basic block are carried out in sequence. It would be great to somehow highlight these basic blocks and perform instructions in them, not losing time on interaction with the main loop.</p><p id="9f3e" data-selectable-paragraph="">In our case we can even broaden out the definition of the basic block to include a full trace. A trace, in terms of the Pig Machine, would include all basic blocks connected in sequence (through unconditional jumps).</p><p id="25eb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Besides the sequential execution of instructions, it also wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea in advance to decode direct arguments for instructions.</p><p id="00b8" data-selectable-paragraph="">This all sounds rather scary and is reminiscent of dynamic compilation, the use of which we decided against. This even made our ‚Äòpig‚Äô begin to doubt its abilities somewhat, but in practice it didn‚Äôt all turn so bad.</p><p id="d15c" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let‚Äôs begin by thinking how we might represent an instruction included in the trace:</p><pre><span id="6f37" data-selectable-paragraph="">struct scode {<br>    uint64_t arg;<br>    trace_op_handler *handler;<br>};</span></pre><p id="78ac" data-selectable-paragraph="">Here arg is a previously decoded instruction argument, and handler a pointer to a function which executes the instruction logic.</p><p id="6736" data-selectable-paragraph="">The representation for each trace now looks like this:</p><pre><span id="d668" data-selectable-paragraph="">typedef scode trace[MAX_TRACE_LEN];</span></pre><p id="beff" data-selectable-paragraph="">So a trace is a sequence of s-codes of limited length.

This technique has many variations, but they all come down to, instead of an array of opcodes, proceeding along an array, for example, of pointers for functions or labels, transitioning between them directly, without intervening opcode-based dispath.</p><p id="3659" data-selectable-paragraph="">Function calls are expensive and don‚Äôt make particular sense in our day and age; for the most part other versions of threaded code cannot be implemented within the confines of standard C.

We used various techniques: superinstructions, cutting out checks for value intervals, a complicated trace mechanism and, finally, even threaded code. In doing so, generally speaking, we acted within the confines of what is implemented in all popular C compilers. Speeding things up by a factor of 1 ¬Ω, it seems to me, isn‚Äôt a bad result and our pig has earned itself an edible reward.</p><p id="6cb1" data-selectable-paragraph="">One of the implicit conditions which, along with our pig, we set ourselves, was to retain the stack architecture of our Piglet Machine. Migrating to a register architecture, as a rule, reduces the quantity of instructions necessary for the programs‚Äô logic and can help cut out unnecessary interactions with the instruction dispatcher. I think another 10‚Äì20% of our time could be saved on that.</p><p id="8dac" data-selectable-paragraph="">Our main condition, the absence of dynamic compilation, isn‚Äôt a hard-and-fast rule either. In our day and age it isn‚Äôt complicated to pump a pig full of ‚Äústeroids‚Äù in the form of JIT compilation: libraries such as<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_lightning" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> GNU Lightning</a> or<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libjit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> LibJIT</a> have already done the preliminary dirty work for us. However, this majorly increases the time invested in development and also the overall volume of code, even when making use of libraries.</p><p id="f030" data-selectable-paragraph="">There are, of course, other approaches that our pig hasn‚Äôt tried yet, but our journey has to come to an end at some point. If you can think of any interesting ways of getting our pig moving, we‚Äôd be glad to give them a try.</p><p id="4d58" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>PS </strong>‚Äî Special thanks go to my sister, Renata Kazanova, for her initial sketches for the illustrations, and to our illustrator, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vovazomb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vladimir Shopotov</a> for the final drawings.</p><p id="3625" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>PPS</strong> ‚Äî The original piglet wasn‚Äôt very talkative and only understood a primitive assembler.

Unexpectedly, this change makes threaded code the fastest option of all and the sieve of Eratosthenes works twice as fast as the na√Øve, original version of the interpreter.
