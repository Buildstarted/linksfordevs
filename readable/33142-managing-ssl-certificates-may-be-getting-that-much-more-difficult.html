In this case, we feel that further shortening certificate lifetimes, especially absent reasonable timelines for companies to prepare, would have the opposite effect in causing significant pain to customers and possibly leading to some human-caused errors as they scramble to adjust. 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We believe the goal of improving certificate security is better served by allowing more time for companies to continue their growing use of automation and to prepare for these changes. DigiCert would like to continue the conversation and gather customer input before this issue is brought to a ballot. We think this discussion should include a timeline that allows for companies to properly plan for shorter lifetimes.      
</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless of the outcome of this ballot, we stand ready to help our customers. DigiCert’s focus and deployment of discovery and automation tools make sure our systems are fully capable of helping our customers meet changes that may arise in industry standards, including shortening lifecycles. In fact, DigiCert currently offers certificate lifetimes as short as eight hours for customers who want that option. Having said that, our ability to help our customers with these changes doesn’t mitigate all the potential impact that a rushed implementation would have on the industry.</p></div></div></div></div>
