    <main class="talk-main"> <p>Debugging is often misunderstood. Many people that are unfamiliar with debugging tend to think it&apos;s all about mastering difficult and austere tools. Kevin often had coworkers asked him &quot;what sequence of commands should I type in WinDbg to debug this kind of issue?&quot;, as if debugging was about applying a simple flowchart with a complex tool. This is, in fact, quite the opposite. Debugging is all about the mindset and the methodology, and the tooling is the simple part. </p>
<p>To illustrate this, we will diagnose and fix a bug in a mainstream application without having the source code or any prior knowledge of its inner workings. Faced with an overwhelming number of unknowns, we&apos;ll see how to methodically gain knowledge about the issue, formulate theories, verify them, and use the results to make progress in the investigation. </p> <br> </main>
