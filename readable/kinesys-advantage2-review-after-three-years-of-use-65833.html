<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>About three-and-a-half years ago, I decided to pay a rather large sum for
    a rather unusual computer keyboard - the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KR1C5PY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01KR1C5PY">Kinesys
    Advantage 2</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" alt="">.</p>



<p>$300 is rather a lot to pay for a keyboard, but as it's something I'm
    using all day when I'm at home, I'm happy to pay for something
    comfortable. But this is not a usual keyboard, as the photo
    indicates.</p>

<p>The most notable statement on the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">product page</a> is that it's an
    <i>ergonomic</i> keyboard. Hence when I mentioned it, the common reaction
    was that I was getting it to combat RSI. But that isn't the case. I did
    suffer from RSI, but that was in the 1990's and I solved it with some
    combination of a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y414QXJ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07Y414QXJ">Microsoft Ergonomic
    Keyboard</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" alt="">, and a palm rest for my mousing hand. </p>

<p>But comfort is more than combating RSI. A good keyboard is just a more
    pleasant experience when you're typing all day. And reading about the
    Kinesis on <a href="https://avdi.codes/why-you-should-spend-350-on-a-computer-keyboard/">Avdi Grimm's blog</a> intrigued me with its
    other features.</p>

<div><p><img src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/kinesis-advantage2/IMG_2930.jpg"></p><p>The keyboard has a concave shape, to make it
    more comfortable to type with (once you're used to it).</p>
</div>

<p>The first one is obvious from the photo - there's no spacebar. On a
    regular keyboard the only thing your thumbs do is insert a space. While
    that's a common occurrence, it seems a shame to have two of your strongest
    digits only do that one thing. The Kinesis instead has thumb clusters with
    several useful keys: return, backspace, space, and forward delete. I find it
    so helpful to be able to hit  keys without taking my hands off the home
    keys. (Although, I actually don't use forward-delete. I'm used to that being
    &lt;CTRL&gt;-D).</p>

<p>Another unusual element for this keyboard is this:</p>

<div><p><img alt="foot pedals" src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/kinesis-advantage2/IMG_2929.jpg"></p>
</div>

<p>I'm sitting at key desk all day, why shouldn't I use my feet? The natural
    thing to use feet for is modifier keys, and I've set it up so that the left
    pedal is CTRL and my right pedal is âŒ˜. I like being able to use my feet to
    avoid tangling my hands in awkward key combinations. I still have the keys
    on the keyboard (with CTRL in the caps-lock position, of course) but most of
    the time I let my feet do the work. I also have the middle pedal set for
    Alt, but I find it's too awkward to use, so I hardly ever use it. (The
    pedals were an extra $100.)</p>

<p>I mention "setting it up", and that's because another serious feature of
    this keyboard is its extreme customizability. I can set any key to do any
    action, and there's a special modifier key to make this easier, allowing the
    user to insert common phrases or any other key combination. I haven't used
    any of this, since my editor is Emacs, and thus I already have as much
    customizability as anyone could ever need.</p>

<p>I might mention my Emacs configuration is a little unusual. I learned
    Emacs back in the 80's, and learned it using Esc as the Meta key. I prefer
    that, as I generally prefer prefix keys to modifiers. So for the Kinesis, I
    configured one of the thumb cluster keys to Esc, and that suits my setup
    perfectly. Again my hands don't leave the keyboard to type Esc. If you look
    at the photo you'll see that the navigation arrow keys are also placed where
    I can easily reach them with my hands on their normal places. I only have to
    move my hands for the mouse or the function keys.</p>

<p>With such an unusual setup, I knew that it would take a while to get used
    to typing with the new configuration. Not just is the spacebar gone, but the
    keys are laid out in a subtlety different way - more comfortable, but ready
    to do a number on my touch-typing. The first week was very frustrating - I
    certainly wasn't used to getting confused between typing a space and a carriage
    return. But after that week, things were mostly ok, and I steadily got better.</p>

<p>One worry I had was that I'd have difficulty typing on a regular keyboard
    once I was used to the Kinesis. Thankfully that hasn't happened. It
    certainly isn't as nice working on the laptop keyboard, and it's another
    reason to miss my home setup. But I have had no difficulty switching from
    one to the other (although I do wonder if my extra-long period at home due
    to covid-19 might make it harder once I disconnect the laptop from its dock
    again).</p>

<p>Not long after I bought it, I started having some faults with the
    keyboard. Kinesis's customer support was excellent, they sent me replacement
    parts, all has been well since.</p>

<p>Would I change anything? Oddly enough I do miss having a big spacebar,
    not when I'm typing, but because it's often used as a control for other
    things, such as the mute/unmute on zoom. I've also wondered if something
    could be done with that space between the keys, perhaps a trackpad, or some
    apple-ribbon like display? But these are nits, all-in-all I've been really
    happy with buying it, and consider it well-worth its high price.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://avdi.codes/why-you-should-spend-350-on-a-computer-keyboard/">Avdi's review</a> has a lot more detail on the keyboard, including
      explanations of its unusual key layout.)</p>
