        </figure><p>Tesco is issuing new cards to 600,000 Clubcard account holders after unearthing a security issue.</p><p>The supermarket giant said it believed a database of stolen usernames and passwords from other platforms had been tried out on its websites, and may have worked in some cases.</p><p>No financial data was accessed and its systems have not been hacked, it added.</p><p>It said this was a precautionary measure and apologised for the inconvenience.</p><p>"We are aware of some fraudulent activity around the redemption of a small proportion of our customers' Clubcard vouchers," a Tesco spokesperson said.</p><p>"Our internal systems picked this up quickly and we immediately took steps to protect our customers and restrict access to their accounts."</p><p>The supermarket said it had emailed everybody potentially affected, that nobody would lose their points and new vouchers would also be issued.</p><p>One of those who received an email was Josh, who works in IT. </p><p>"The email was very ambiguous," he said.</p><p>"I thought it was because I'd just used a new bank card.  I didn't realise it was actually my account details that could have been compromised.</p><p>"It worried me - I feel better now it's been clarified."</p><p>Others responded in good humour on social media, questioning how much their points would actually be worth to a hacker.</p><p>The UK loyalty scheme offers one point for every pound spent in store. Every 100 points are worth Â£1.</p><p>The BBC understands about 19 million people have a Clubcard account.</p><p>Jake Moore, cyber-security specialist at the firm Eset, told the BBC plenty of people still use simple passwords or similar log-ins for many different platforms.</p><p>"Cyber-criminals can do a lot of damage with a large breached list simply containing names and emails or other trivial data," he said. </p><p>"The big risk is via brute force attacking the accounts where criminals use leaked common password combinations against the emails to try to break into other personal accounts."</p><p>Mr Moore suggested using password managers to generate and store uniquely different passwords, and two factor authentication where possible - in which a text message or email code is required as well as the password.</p>
