Just like with <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0-preview-8/" rel="nofollow">Preview 8</a>, weâ€™ve focused on polishing .NET Core 3.0 for a final release and arenâ€™t adding new features.

We will launch .NET Core 3.0 during <a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/?utm_source=dotnet&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=savedate" target="_blank">.NET Conf</a>. Yes, that means that Preview 9 is the last preview, and .NET Core 3.0 will be released in its final version later this month. We have a lot of great speakers and content prepared for .NET Conf this year. Itâ€™s one of the big .NET developer events each year, and you cannot beat the price. Itâ€™s free and <a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/?utm_source=dotnet&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=savedate" target="_blank">streaming online</a>.</p><h2>Visual Studio Support</h2><p>.NET Core 3.0 is supported with <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2019 16.3 Preview 3</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/install-preview?view=vsmac-2019" target="_blank">Visual Studio for Mac 8.3</a>, which were also released today. Please upgrade to it for the best (and supported) experience with .NET Core 3.0 Preview 9. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes-preview#16.3.0-pre.3.0" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2019 16.3 release notes</a> for more information.</p><p>We know that some folks have been successful using .NET Core 3.0 builds with Visual Studio 2019 16.2 and wonder why 16.3 is required. The short answer is that we only test .NET Core 3.0 with Visual Studio 2019 16.3 and have made many improvements and key fixes that are only in 16.3. The same model applies to Visual Studio for Mac 8.3.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode" target="_blank">C# Extension</a> for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> is always updated to support new .NET Core versions. Make sure you have the latest version of the C# extension installed.</p><h2>Go Live</h2><p>NET Core 3.0 Preview 9 is supported by Microsoft and can be used in production. We strongly recommend that you test your app running on Preview 9 before deploying into production. If you find an issue with .NET Core 3.0, please file a <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a> and/or contact <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportforbusiness/productselection?fltadd=sps-business-1&amp;sapId=4fd4947b-15ea-ce01-080f-97f2ca3c76e8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft support</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft .NET Site</a> has been updated to .NET Core 3.0 Preview 9 (see the .NET Core runtime version in the footer text). Itâ€™s been running great on previews, starting with Preview 7, on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Azure WebApps</a> (as a self-contained app). Check out the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft .NET site</a> and see for yourself how it performs on Preview 9.</p><h2>Closing</h2><p>The .NET Core 3.0 release is coming close to completion, and the team is solely focused on stability and reliability now that weâ€™re no longer building new features. Please tell us about any issues you find, ideally as quickly as possible. We want to get as many fixes in as possible before we ship the final 3.0 release.</p><p>If you missed earlier (more exciting) posts about .NET Core 3.0, check out the improvements that were part of <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0-preview-6/" rel="nofollow">.NET Core 3.0 Preview 6</a> (last preview with new features) and earlier releases.</p><p>If you install daily builds, read an important <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/118" target="_blank">announcement about .NET Core master branches</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>
