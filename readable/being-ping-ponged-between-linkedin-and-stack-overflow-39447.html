        <p>I'm truly sorry this happened to you, but unfortunately, this is on LinkedIn, and we can do little to help.</p>

<p>We have extensive guidance on which questions you can ask here, and how companies can support their product here. The ones applicable to this situation are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/255746">Why can't I ask customer service-related questions?</a> (I've already shared this one with you when closing the question)</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/product-support">Can I support my product on this site?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These kind of support questions are just not acceptable on Stack Overflow, and that's not going to change. Anything that can't be answered by a person knowledgeable in the subject, but not employed at LinkedIn is not a good question here.</p>

<p>Apparently, this is a longstanding issue, and the text you got is very similar to the one quoted in <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/278748/7296893">LinkedIn directing people to SO?</a> (asked in 2014), and there's been <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/281019/7296893">a call to reach out to LinkedIn</a> back in 2014 too.</p>

<p>You can try linking them this question and answer, and hope they change their ways. We can also hope a community manager at Stack Overflow picks up on this issue, and has a talk with LinkedIn about our rules. But we can't just reopen your question and hope it gets answered, because that would open the flood gates for other companies to redirect their customer support to Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>If you want to be sure this gets picked up by the community team at Stack Overflow, you can contact them via <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/contact">https://stackoverflow.com/contact</a>, as linked in <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/255746">Why can't I ask customer service-related questions?</a>. Note that this sometimes has a substantial waiting time.</p>
