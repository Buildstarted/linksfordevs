We are bringing together technologists, from all backgrounds and from around the globe, with two important goals in mind: to raise awareness and provide financial support for the many people fighting the current coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic, while also delivering hope and reconnecting those in our global developer community.

Dev Around The Sun is a cross-platform, language-agnostic event, with high-level tech talks, as well as human skills talks. We have renowned speakers from a broad set of communities, spanning many technologies and all continents, who will educate, entertain, and inspire our international audience in the comfort of their own homes.

We want to ensure that no matter who you are and what role technology plays in your life, you have the opportunity to take part in a very important cause during these times, while at the same time being part of a vast community of people with shared interests.

By collecting funds via attendee contributions, corporate sponsorships, and matching donations, we will all be able to give back to those affected by this crisis, with the hope that folks taking part in this event will be able contribute in any way they can.

Our schedule of speakers is available on the website: https://devaroundthesun.org/schedule
