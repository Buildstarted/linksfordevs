Eg: "You can order 3 Uber rides for free, no data use, with us!"</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Which I guess makes more sense. The point is still the same though... ISPs are looking inside your data packets to make these content discrimination decisions.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">(edited to fix my horrible 6AM grammar)</p></div></div></div></div>
