    <div class="css-8atqhb"><p class="css-vz0241">It&apos;s a bitter brew, but it&apos;s far more than a storm in a teacup - your so-called smart kettle may be selling you out to cyber criminals.</p><p class="css-vz0241">That&#x2019;s the grim warning from some of the country&#x2019;s top tech experts as millions of Aussie families welcome more internet-connected devices into their homes.</p><p class="css-vz0241">Last year the &#x201C;internet of things&#x201D; - or IoT - market in Australia grew by 57 per cent to be worth $1.1 billion, <a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="https://www.telsyte.com.au/announcements/2019/5/14/australian-iothome-market-cracks-1bn-paving-the-way-for-iot-commerce-services">new research</a> by tech analysts Telsyte reveals.</p><p class="css-vz0241">It says more than half of Aussie households now have at least one &#x201C;smart home&#x201D; product installed, an increase of more than 30 per cent on 2017 figures.</p><p class="css-vz0241"><strong>Watch the video above.</strong></p><p class="css-vz0241">But as we adopt smart speakers, TVs, fridges, light bulbs, air conditioners, security cameras, robotic vacuum cleaners and even smaller appliances such as wifi enabled kettles and rice cookers, experts fear the <a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="http://now.northropgrumman.com/hacking-devices-in-the-not-so-smart-home/">tech may be moving faster</a> than our capacity to secure it.</p><h2 class="css-bjbesg">Hackers pounce</h2><p class="css-vz0241"><a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="https://www.gearbrain.com/smart-home-devices-attract-hackers-2628317309.html">Tests conducted </a>by cybersecurity firm NetSocut over the last Christmas period found that hackers would pounce within five minutes of a new device going online.</p><p class="css-vz0241">&#x201C;Manufacturers make these things so easy to use - imagine if you bought a kettle and you had to spend 10 minutes making it secure - everything is now plug and play so it is compromised from the beginning,&#x201D; <a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="https://www.acs.org.au/">Australian Computer Society </a>president Yohan Ramasundara told 7NEWS.com.au.</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--no-attrib css-a47apt"><svg class="css-q320ic"><path/></svg>You are opening up for hackers to come in.&apos;</blockquote><p class="css-vz0241">&#x201C;As these things become the norm, you are simply opening up all sorts of possibilities for hackers to come in.&#x201D;</p><p class="css-vz0241"><strong>For more technology news click <a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="https://7news.com.au/technology">here</a>.</strong></p><p class="css-vz0241">Security expert Troy Hunt - founder of website <a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>, which allows individual users to see if their security has been compromised - says the IoT risks are threefold.</p><p class="css-vz0241">&#x201C;One of the risks is that IoT is collecting a lot of data out there &#x2026; The other class of risk is control of the IoT device by another party,&#x201D; he told 7NEWS.com.au.</p><p class="css-vz0241">&#x201C;And the third thing is that often these devices are a pinhole into the network,&#x201D; he said.</p><p class="css-vz0241">Hunt uses the example of smart lightbulbs which, to a cyber crook with a bit of nouse, effectively leak wifi passwords and &#x201C;become the vector by which people can get into the network&#x201D;.</p><h2 class="css-bjbesg">Security lagging</h2><p class="css-vz0241"><a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="https://www.finder.com.au/author/alexkidman">Tech and telco editor at finder.com.au</a> Alex Kidman warns there has not yet been &#x201C;a consistent approach to security around these devices&#x201D;.</p><p class="css-vz0241">Kidman points out that for smartphone, laptop and desktop operating systems, the software and security is constantly updated by the likes of tech titans such as Apple, Microsoft and Google.</p><blockquote class="pullquote pullquote--no-attrib css-a47apt"><svg class="css-q320ic"><path/></svg>It could be prone to security flaws down the track.&apos;</blockquote><p class="css-vz0241">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t tend to see that as frequently with IoT gadgets and if a vendor shifts to a new gadget they might change their entire architecture, and abandon an existing one, so it may still work, but it could be prone to security flaws down the track with no resources being put into that device,&#x201D; he said.</p><p class="css-vz0241">But the worst of it is not even knowing your home has been digitally broken into, as Ramasundara points out.</p><p class="css-vz0241">&#x201C;Back in the day, when someone broke into your house and you&#x2019;d see a smashed door or window, there would be something physical, but when people hack your systems, there is no sign, you could be compromised for years before you find out.</p><p class="css-vz0241">&quot;And it doesn&apos;t get reported into a central location, so I think there is a lot more going on than what it is reported and it is going to increase every day.&quot;</p><h2 class="css-bjbesg">Hacking horror</h2><p class="css-vz0241">In 2016, Troy Hunt revealed<a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35642749"> how easily the Nissan electric car, the Leaf </a>could be hacked to hijack the vehicle&#x2019;s climate control systems and get data about the driver&#x2019;s journeys, leaving the global manufacturing giant scrambling to fix the flaw.</p><p class="css-vz0241">In 2017, <a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/02/28/cloudpets-data-leak-is-a-privacy-nightmare-for-parents-and-kids/#b053f7b0bfa4">Hunt also discovered that internet-connected toys called CloudPets</a> could be used as remote surveillance devices and that personal data associated with, as well as messages recorded by kids on the toys could also be easily accessed.</p><p class="css-vz0241">Over the past few years there have been myriad reports of baby monitors being hacked and used as surveillance devices. Earlier this year <a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2019/02/12/smart-home-devices-like-nest-thermostat-hacked/39049903/">a US couple awoke to threats being broadcast through their baby monitor </a>while in another instance a young mum realised she was being <a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/06/05/617196788/s-c-mom-says-baby-monitor-was-hacked-experts-say-many-devices-are-vulnerable">watched as she breastfed her son</a>.</p><p class="css-vz0241">Meanwhile, last month <a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="https://esafety.gov.au/about-the-office/newsroom/blog/when-smart-is-not-necessarily-safe-rise-of-connected-devices-to-extending-domestic-violence?fbclid=IwAR2F26HWyqE94ArDaXaI-xwmz4xF5gwMajVfTOHm9A7_LQ6zjVsJYOO0XP8">Australia&#x2019;s eSafety Commissioner</a> cited an example of a man hacking his former partner&#x2019;s smart TV to leave threatening messages, while another hacked into his former partner&#x2019;s car to limit how far she could drive it.</p><h2 class="css-bjbesg">Staying safe</h2><p class="css-vz0241">If you do have wifi connected cameras, keep them pointed where they can do no harm.</p><p class="css-vz0241">Keep your home IoT devices and your PCs, laptops and smartphones on separate networks.</p><p class="css-vz0241">Ask yourself whether you really need the smart devices you have.</p><p class="css-vz0241">Constantly check for app updates for your smart devices.</p><p class="css-vz0241">Check out <a class="css-1qv0k0w" href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-iot-smart-home-security-core.html">Norton&apos;s 12 tips to help secure your smart home and IoT devices</a>.</p></div>
