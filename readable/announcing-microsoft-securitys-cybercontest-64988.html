						<p>The realm of cybersecurity is more than a combination of its technical components like hardware and software. It’s an industry that’s founded on the innovation and creativity of its practitioners—continually discovering better ways to protect our homes and our businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="toc-hId-1200807049">Historical Moments in Cybersecurity</h3>

<p>Without creativity, many of the historical milestones in cybersecurity wouldn’t have been possible. The ingenuity of security and IT leaders has enabled us to not just communicate remotely around the world but <em>securely </em>communicate. Let’s take a short trip down memory lane to relive some of the industry’s evolutions:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>870: </strong>Though door locks have been around for 4000 years (privacy is…key), the first all-metal lock came out of England.</li>
<li><strong>1959: </strong>Machine learning was first defined in the late 50s, and today we’re finding more and more applications of machine learning in cybersecurity, from intelligently blocking malware attacks to correlating events into incidents.</li>
<li><strong>1961: </strong>The first-ever password (Who wants to bet it was “1234”?) was created to secure a MIT computer. Now, more than 50 years later, we’re releasing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-my/security/business/identity/passwordless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noopener noreferrer">passwordless</a> technology like biometrics.</li>
<li><strong>1987: </strong>The first removal of a virus in the wild—Vienna Virus—happened in 1987. The creator of the virus was never identified, and though it was neutralized, it was used as a template for many complex variants over the years.</li>
<li><strong>1993: </strong>The first DEF CON conference was hosted in Las Vegas, naturally. Since its inception, the event has grown its attendance from 100 people to a whopping 30,000.</li>
<li><strong>1999:</strong> The first version of SSL was released in 1999. Over 20 years later, TLS has replaced SSL as the industry standard—fixing bugs and vulnerabilities which enabled attackers to gain access to personal information.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2000s have seen even more advancement as we continue to bring technologies—such as deep learning, decentralized identity, and biometrics—into our everyday lives. The goal: a safer world and more sci-fi-esque gadgets.</p>

<h3 id="toc-hId--606647414">Celebrating Ongoing Improvement</h3>

<p>It’s truly great to see how the community has continued to iterate and evolve the cybersecurity space.&nbsp;<strong>Over the next few weeks, we’re partnering with cartoonist Drew Dernavich from The New Yorker Magazine to capture the central role of creativity in security. </strong><strong>Comment or direct message us on </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/msftsecurity/status/1283794773556572165" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>@MSFTSecurity</strong></a><strong> with an example of how you used creativity to solve a security challenge and be entered to win a cartoon of your story! Don’t forget to use the hashtag #CyberContest.</strong></p>
