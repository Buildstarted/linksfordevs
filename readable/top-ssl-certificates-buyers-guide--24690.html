        <h2>What Is an SSL Certificate?</h2>
<p>If you're looking to celebrate National Small Business Week by starting your own online business, then you must be thinking about website security, and that means purchasing an SSL certificate. <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/51944/ssl" target="_self">Secure Sockets Layer</a> (SSL) certificates are most often associated with e-commerce sites, both retail and service-oriented, but really it's a key component any time you're connecting two computers. That's because it's central to encrypting the data stream that's running between those two machines, and these days, encryption is a baseline for almost any kind of Internet transaction. Having an recognized SSL certificate managing your site's encryption is also a requirement for ensuring that Google doesn't flag your website as being a potential threat to visitors.</p>

<p>Without the ability to guarantee that data is safe and authentic, conducting business over the web would be risky and unreliable. If you don't have an SSL certificate, then your web traffic is open to snooping by hackers. Furthermore, in 2014, <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html" target="_blank">Google announced</a> that a website's search rank would be heavily influenced by whether or not it uses SSL, so it's a big factor in getting noticed on the web. With Google's "HTTPS Everywhere" initiative in full force, everyone with a web presence should consider having an SSL certificate but it's practically mandatory for <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2484670,00.asp">e-commerce</a> merchants.</p>

<h2>What Are My Options?</h2>
<p>If you're wondering how to get an SSL certificate or deciding which is the best for you, it's important to understand the three types of certificates available. Many <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/web-hosting-services/9189/the-best-web-hosting-services">web hosting providers</a> have certificate options they'll push at you or offer as part of one-stop-shop bundles, but very few actually require you to use those certificates. So shop around because your options should remain open.</p>

<p>All SSL certificates are used to encrypt data, but there is no guarantee that the server on the other end is friendly or even the one to which you're expecting to talk. To solve this problem, you have a trusted third party, known as a certificate authority, that charges a fee to investigate the company and issue the SSL certificate. The logic is that, if you trust the third party and the third party trusts the SSL certificate, then you can trust the certificate and the server that's showing it to you. What separates out SSL certificates is how much due diligence has gone toward establishing that trust. For the most part, SSL certificates break down into three categories:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Domain-Validated (DV) Certificate</strong>. Ranging in cost from free to cheap, such as Geotrust's QuickSSL Premium option or RapidSSL's offering, this kind of SSL certificate is fine for internal projects but not acceptable for the open web. Use extreme caution on websites that use this kind of certificate. In fact, you're probably best off clicking away from them as fast as you can.</li>
	<li><strong>Organization-Validated (OV) Certificate</strong>. Because businesses and organizations already have some level of authentication with a governing body, they can be easily verified by the certificate authority as legitimate. Generally, the organization listed on the request will be contacted and asked to provide some proof that it is valid. This is the bare minimum level of SSL certificate that should be considered for a commercial website.</li>
	<li><strong>Extended Validation (EV)</strong> <strong>Certificate. </strong>This is the third and most-trusted level of SSL certificates. The <a href="https://cabforum.org/extended-validation/" target="_blank">published guidelines</a> for EV certificates are both strict and thorough. It's not uncommon for proof of identity, capacity, and place of business to be requested and verified. Before the EV certificate is issued, the identity of the legal entity that controls the website is determined and published. As a bonus, most modern web browsers will indicate that an EV certificate is being used by showing a green <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/53516/url">Uniform Resource Locator</a> (URL) bar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each level of SSL certificate also has two variations. A single-domain certificate, like it sounds, protects a single website. As a result, it tends to be cheaper. Its cousin, the wildcard certificate, lets you protect multiple sub-domains and tends to be more expensive. However, if you want an EV certificate, then the only option is to get a single-domain certificate. This is due to the extra scrutiny placed on how and where it's used. If you need to cover multiple sub-domains with EV certificates, then sometimes you can get a volume discount but this will vary from provider to provider.</p>

<h2>SSL Certificate Implementation</h2>
<p>It's not enough to simply click "buy," add an SSL certificate to your cart, and then check out. The software you want to secure will have a certificate request procedure that will need to be followed to the letter. All reputable SSL certificate vendors, including GeoTrust, GoDaddy, and Symantec, have instructions for generating this request so it pays to carefully read through those. This is especially true if you're applying for an EV certificate.</p>

<p>After generating the request, you'll submit it to the SSL certificate authority for processing. This could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few weeks. After passing any verification requests, you will receive the completed SSL certificate that can be loaded into your web server.</p>

<h2>TLS vs. SSL</h2>
<p>If you recently purchased an SSL certificate, then you likely installed it and went about your daily business, knowing that your website was more secure for your visitors. However, the reality is that the SSL protocol has been deprecated for years due to some specific <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-reveals-major-flaw-in-outdated-but-widely-used-ssl-protocol/" target="_blank">security issues</a>. The term, however, has persisted.</p>

<p>At its core, SSL is simply a "handshake" protocol, meaning it's the method that two computers use to securely decide on what kind of encryption they'll use when communicating with each other, and what secret password they're going to share to make that work. But the handshake is a critical stage in the secure communications process because, if it's compromised, then the encryption step that follows is rendered useless. Fortunately, the handshake protocol that's supplanted SSL these days is called <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/52944/tls" target="_self">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS). While TLS is similar, it's still a significantly better option.</p>

<p>TLS was introduced only a little after SSL as a similar but more secure follow-on. The two continued to evolve in parallel until SSL was eventually retired in 2015. Since then, TLS has continued to be the preferred option, and most browsers these days will not show you a padlock icon if SSL 2.0 or SSL 3.0 protocols are being used. But this shift has happened very much under the proverbial covers outside of hardcore web administrator circles, so it's perfectly logical to be asking “Are my SSL certificates compatible with TLS?”</p>

<p>Short answer: Yes, they absolutely are. The main takeaway is that terminology can sometimes be misleading because it evolves not only as the industry does, but also according to the laws of common usage. You can rest assured, however, that, if you’ve bought a certificate from a trusted authority, then you didn’t buy something outdated. Remember that protocols are always evolving; TLS is already at version 1.2 and will continue to change as time goes on. The certificate is necessary, but it is the web servers that decide on both encryption type and handshake protocols.</p>

<h2>What to Avoid</h2>
<p>Since it's not uncommon to spend hundreds or even several thousands of dollars per year on certificates, there is a strong temptation to use bargain-basement options that promise the same level of protection for a lower price. In fact, 2048-bit certificates are often pushed as a selling point. The plain truth is that anything below that isn't even recognized by Microsoft browsers as of Jan. 1, 2017. It's only a matter of time before other browsers and platforms follow suit. So, while it's important that your certificate be hashed with <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/68965/sha" target="_self">Secure Hash Algorithm 2</a> (SHA-2) and support <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/36979/256-bit" target="_self">256-bit encryption</a>, it's easy to get lost in the technical details.</p>

<p>The real defining attribute is how much the world trusts the organization issuing the certificate. Authorities such as Network Solutions and Symantec are well-known and accepted by browser developers. Certificates issued by the major players are trusted by default. While it's easy to get a certificate from a bargain-basement authority, there are often additional hoops and hurdles through which to jump to get it recognized. This is not a position in which you want to put your customers and, if you do, many will probably click the Back button anyway. In summary, shop around but remember: You usually get what you pay for.</p>
