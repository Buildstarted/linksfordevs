<h2>Books available from Amazon</h2>
<h2>Buy <a href="http://amzn.to/2F4nz7k" rel="nofollow">Volume 1</a></h2>
<h2>Buy <a href="http://amzn.to/2EQtPR2" rel="nofollow">Volume 2</a></h2>
<h2>Free Kindle Apps</h2>
<p>The books are available from Amazon in Kindle form. Amazon makes a
free Kindle reader for practically anything with a screen. You can
download them at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp</a></p>

<p>This directory holds files that aren't figures or notebooks.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DL-layer-icons.ai</code> The icons I use in the book for deep learning layers. The file is stored in the legacy Adobe Illustrator CC format, so it should be readable on any version of Illustrator from then on.</li>
<li><code>DL-layer-icons.png</code> A 300 dpi image version of the AI file, for those without Illustrator.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only three chapters in the book contain explicit code. Chapter 15 discusses
the Scikit-Learn library, and Chapters 23 and 24 discuss the Keras library. All of
the code in these chapters is in Python, and is provided in Jupyter notebooks.</p>
<p>Most other chapters in the book contain at least some figures that were generated
procedurally using Python. Those chapters also have associated notebooks which are
available here. Those notebooks are not part of the book itself, but are offered
as a kind of "behind the scenes" look at how the figures were made for those who
want to dig into the process. These notebooks are only lightly documented.</p>
<p>Because of their role as learning materials, all of the code in these notebooks
was written to emphasize clarity over all other stylistic concerns. This means
that much of it can be shortened, and probably made faster as well. Feel free
to dig in, optimize, convert to other languages, or otherwise play with the code.</p>
<p>All the notebooks are released under the MIT license. Informally, you're free to
do pretty much anything with the code, including using it in your own projects,
or even including it in commercial projects, as long as you keep my copyright
along with the code. While I strove for accuracy and correctness, there is no
warranty that the code is bug-free or fit for any purpose.</p>
<p>Some notebooks work with images. The images I used in the book are included
with the notebooks. See the section below on Figures for details on their
licensing, and see the book for the URL where each image may be found. All images
without an explicit citation in the book are by the author, and are released
under the MIT license.</p>
<p>The code for Volumes 1 and 2 are each in their own GitHub repo:</p>
<h3>Notebooks for Volume 1:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blueberrymusic/DeepLearningBookCode-Volume1">https://github.com/blueberrymusic/DeepLearningBookCode-Volume1</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Notebooks for Volume 2:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blueberrymusic/DeepLearningBookCode-Volume2">https://github.com/blueberrymusic/DeepLearningBookCode-Volume2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The book is illustrated with roughly 1000 original figures. Most were drawn
by the author in Adobe Illustrator. A few were drawn in Photoshop. All
are available here in PNG format.</p>
<p>Most of these images are saved at high resolution (300 dpi or better), so
they are appropriate for presentations and talks even when projected
to large size.</p>
<p>All of these figures are released under the MIT license, like the code. This
means you're free to use them any way you like, as long as you keep the
copyright associated with them somehow. Use them for your classes,
reports, papers, presentations, whatever you like!</p>
<p>You're not required to attribute me or the book if you use these images,
but I'd appreciate it if you would.</p>
<p>Some figures include photographs. Many of these are by the author. All other
photos are from Wikiart, Wikimedia, or Pixabay. The book provides a citation
and URL to the source of each of these images. The first two sites state that
their images are in the public domain. All images selected from Pixabay are
labeled as released under the Creative Commons CC0 license, and explicitly
state, "Free for commercial use. No attribution required."</p>
<p>To help you better sort through and choose figures, thumbnails for all
the figures are available.</p>
