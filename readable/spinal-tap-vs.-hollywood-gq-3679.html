The group, they decided, would be called Spinal Tap, a name meant to parody the gothic pretensions of heavy metal. They—“they” being Harry Shearer, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Rob Reiner, four comedic actors in their 30s—spent hours inventing the band's extensive backstory, which they would memorize before cameras rolled.</p></inline-embed><p>Shearer, who plays bassist Derek Smalls, says everything from the title of the band's first single (“Gimme Some Money”) to the cause of death of one of their many drummers (spontaneous combustion) came out of these early meetings, where the goal was to crack one another up. “That's the scientific term for our methods: sitting around laughing,” he says. A beat, and then he adds with a wry smile: “So why should we be paid for it?”</p><p>In the 33 years since the release of <em>This Is Spinal Tap</em>—which Guest once labeled “spomage,” for its rare mixture of spoof and homage—the film has become not just a beloved cult classic but also a national treasure. The Library of Congress has deemed it “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.” A whole generation of comedians (and not just comedians) has grown up quoting it. Ricky Gervais called it “a huge influence” and “my favorite comedy of all time.” But even as the film's most hilarious moments have become touchstones—guitarist Nigel Tufnel's explanation, say, of precisely why an amp that goes to 11 is louder than one that goes to 10 (“Well, it's one louder, isn't it?”)—the royalty checks from <em>This Is Spinal Tap</em> have remained suspiciously tiny. What started as a send-up of the music business has turned into a lesson in the absurdities of the film business.</p><p>“I think we all shared this inchoate fantasy that because we'd made fun of this stuff, it wouldn't happen to us,” Shearer tells me not long after I meet him at his home in New Orleans. He's talking about the real-life indignities that the fake band has endured over the years, but there's a hint of the creators' current predicament in there as well: “When we started getting fucked over, we were just like, ‘My God!’—in blank disbelief.”</p><p>The guys are all believers now, which is why they've filed a $400 million lawsuit against the French conglomerate Vivendi and its film subsidiary Studiocanal, which owns the rights to <em>Spinal Tap</em>. Among the suit's charges: fraud, breach of contract, and abuse of power “as part of an intentional scheme” to deprive the creators of what is legitimately theirs. (Vivendi's lawyers deny any wrongdoing, calling the $400 million figure “fanciful” at best.)</p><p>Central to the band's case is the claim that Vivendi has been hiding millions of dollars in profits from <em>Spinal Tap</em> by packaging the movie with flops, an accounting trick known as cross-collateralizing. The film, the company insists, is barely breaking even. “Do they believe their own financial statements?” Shearer asks. “Because if they're believing what they send to us, I think they need medical attention.”</p><p>Shearer filed the initial complaint in October; Guest, McKean, and Reiner joined as co-plaintiffs in February. (They declined to be interviewed for this story, sending word that Shearer would speak for the lawsuit and the band.) In a February motion to dismiss the case, Vivendi's lawyers claim <em>Spinal Tap,</em> which Shearer says cost just $2.25 million to make, has generated less than $5 million in U.S. ticket sales. But box-office receipts are only a portion of what Shearer and the others are after. Their 1982 contract says they are due 40 percent of all net receipts that emanate from the film and 50 percent of gross receipts related to the music. Since the film was released, there have been numerous VHS and DVD editions, follow-up albums, and reunion concerts, and all sorts of merchandise sold along the way. To quote the movie, <em>Spinal Tap</em> has become, like a cherished electric guitar, “famous for its sustain.” Yet, according to the band's filing, the four creators' supposed share of total worldwide merchandising income between 1984 and 2013 was only $81. Their share of music sales for a similar period was $98.</p><p>“If you don't fight, you're really just roadkill,” Shearer says, his wiry five-foot-eight-inch frame straining over his dining-room table. “If I had a slogan, that would be it: Fight or be roadkill.” The credo explains not only this lawsuit but also Shearer's approach to nearly everything. “I've, through no fault of my own, gained a certain reputation in the business as a troublemaker,” he says. Most famously, he battled 20th Century Fox—and won—over the terms of his contract on <em>The Simpsons.</em> (He voices 23 characters on the show, including Ned Flanders, Mr. Burns, and Principal Skinner.) When I tell Shearer that I've read that he considers himself an Old Testament guy, he grins. “That's true. My God is a God of vengeance.”</p></div></div><div><div><figure><figcaption data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Caption&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Caption&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><span><p>Spinal Tap shooting a music video in 1992, eight years after the release of the film.</p>
</span><span>Henry Diltz / Morrison Hotel Gallery</span></figcaption></figure><p>Shearer's home in New Orleans, a four-story converted macaroni factory, provides evidence of where his combative approach has gotten him. There are gold-paneled walls, impossibly high ceilings, parquet floors, a marble ballroom (complete with baby-grand piano), and the gaudiest collection of Mardi Gras tiaras and crowns ever assembled in one place. Shearer himself is bedecked in a riot of color—a navy-gold-and-red striped dress shirt over a purple T-shirt, maroon jeans, and a rainbow-striped pair of Y3 Yohji Yamamoto high-tops. <em>The Simpsons,</em> it's clear, has been very good to Shearer, which is why he can afford to go after the “larcenous executives” who he says are doing him and countless others wrong. “I think that there is a public interest in exposing what happens to artists and creators as they encounter the giant wheels of commerce,” he says. “I'm not doing this to stage a spectacle, but by the same token I'm not in a big hurry to go behind closed doors with somebody who is not wearing a robe.” A trial, in addition to possibly providing the band with a long-deferred payday, could force Vivendi to finally pull back the curtain on its accounting practices.</p><p>“Look, we put the number 11 on the map,” Shearer says, enjoying how silly it sounds to say that. His eyes gleam as he leans closer to my tape recorder. “Warning to Vivendi,” he growls, “I'm like a dog with a bone.”</p><inline-embed childtypes="" name="dropcap"><p>Vivendi isn't the only company that's been accused of using accounting tricks to avoid paying out profits. Movie studios routinely insist that even the biggest blockbusters make no money. In the two years after its release, for example, <em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</em> grossed $612 million for Warner Bros., but the net-profit statement still showed a loss.</p></inline-embed><div data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GenericCallout&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GenericCallout&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><figure><figcaption data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Caption&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Caption&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><span><p>Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer) in 1992.</p>
</span><span>Henry Diltz / Morrison Hotel Gallery</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The whole system, of course, is structured for just such an outcome. Here's how Warner Bros. did the math for Mr. Potter: A $211 million distribution fee came right off the top, plus an additional $131 million in advertising and publicity (some of which was likely spent on TV networks owned by the studio's parent company, Time Warner) and $61 million in other “expenses” (stuff like prints, dubbing, and shipping). Then came the studio's $313 million in “negative cost” (what the film cost to make) and nearly $58 million in interest. The bottom line: The film was said to have lost $167 million.</p><p>Shearer, who hired a forensic accountant adept at finding where revenues are stashed in order to build his case against Vivendi, sums up the business model of the major studios like this: “‘Here's your budget. It's a loan at prime plus two, and then we'll do your distribution for a fee of 30 percent off the top, and all of our costs are chargeable against you.’ It's ludicrous. Nobody else in the world could get away with it.” Add to this the fact that any artists promised a portion of net profits must rely on the studios to report what they're owed, and the table is set for mischief. Not for nothing did David Mamet include these lines in <em>Speed-the-Plow,</em> his satirical dissection of the American movie business: “Two things I've learned, 25 years in the entertainment industry.… The first one is: There is no ‘net.’… And I forgot the second one.”</p><p>When it comes to the lawsuits this system inevitably provokes, studios prefer to settle rather than open their books to scrutiny. (The numbers for <em>Harry Potter</em> are public only because they were leaked to Deadline.com.) In 1988, however, in what is widely regarded as the granddaddy of such cases, Art Buchwald struck a blow for transparency when he sued Paramount Pictures. Buchwald claimed that the studio had stolen his script treatment and made it into Eddie Murphy's comedy <em>Coming to America.</em> But when the case went to trial, what the judge called the studio's “unconscionable” accounting methods drew more attention than any underlying thievery. At the time, worldwide box-office receipts for <em>Coming to America</em> were more than $350 million, on an estimated budget of $39 million, but the studio was still showing a loss. Buchwald would later write that the brouhaha was “a minor breach-of-contract case which turned into an historic legal battle over the way the motion picture studios keep their books and diddle their talent.” The studio settled for an undisclosed amount.</p></div></div><div><div><p>In the intervening years, everyone from Stan Lee to Peter Jackson to the estate of J. R. R. Tolkien has sued, alleging that their rightful piece of the back end had been withheld, and almost all those cases have been settled for undisclosed amounts. Consider producer Irwin Winkler's 2015 suit against Warner Bros., which stated he hadn't been paid his 50 percent share of the net profits from the 1990 Mob classic <em>Goodfellas.</em> According to the complaint, Warners sent periodic net-profit reports for a while (the studio eventually stopped, claiming the film would never, ever be in the black), but those reports intentionally misrepresented how much the film had made (allegedly more than $275 million). Winkler claimed that Warners had concealed about $140 million in revenue by playing a sort of shell game with its wholly owned subsidiary, Warner Home Video, and had also charged fees and interest on past fees. “This was ‘studio accounting’ on steroids,” the suit alleged. “It was also fraud.” Warners settled last year.</p><div data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GenericCallout&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GenericCallout&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><figure><figcaption data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Caption&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Caption&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><span><p>Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) in 1992.</p>
</span><span>Henry Diltz / Morrison Hotel Gallery</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Disputes don't always end up in court. Years ago, the talent agent who repped Peter Cattaneo, the director of the indie comedy <em>The Full Monty</em> (which was 20th Century Fox's runaway hit of 1997), took him to lunch at Spago to go over the studio's accounting report. While <em>The Full Monty</em> had cost just $3 million to make and had taken in almost $200 million worldwide, the report said Cattaneo was not yet due any back end. Dumbfounded, the agent flagged down Bill Mechanic, the then head of Fox's movie studio, who was walking by. Mechanic sat down, read over the accounting statement, and said, “We owe you some money.” A few days later, Fox delivered a $1 million check.</p><p>Shearer says he understands why others shy from battle: Suing has a way of making you unpopular (read: unemployable). But thanks to Shearer's financial wherewithal and advancing years (he's 73), he doesn't have to worry about that. “I'm at a point in my life where I couldn't care less,” he says. “Everything gets you labeled diffcult. If you want to do it the right way, it gets you labeled diffcult. If you want to hew more closely to your style as opposed to somebody else's, it gets you labeled diffcult. But sometimes you just have to protect yourself.”</p><inline-embed childtypes="" name="dropcap"><p>Creative Hollywood accounting may have inspired the lawsuit, but Shearer seems equally fired up about a different legal mission: reclaiming control of the Spinal Tap name. Shearer says Vivendi currently requires the men who invented Tap to ask permission (and sometimes pay fees) before they can perform in character. (Vivendi's lawyers declined to comment.) “It's safe to say that the only people they've gone after to enforce their claimed rights are the creators of the picture,” Shearer grumbles. “All the bootleggers have gotten off scot-free.” But creators can regain control of their copyrights in some circumstances after 35 years.</p></inline-embed><p>Vivendi has stated that the film was written by Shearer, Guest, McKean, and Reiner as a “work for hire”—essentially, that it was created with the understanding that the company is the statutory author and rights holder. (“Vivendi is re-writing history,” Guest countered in a statement released on Fairness Rocks, Shearer's website about the case.) The company claims that the four creators were under contract during the shooting and editing of the movie, beginning in 1982, so the intellectual property belongs to the studio. But, importantly, the first appearance of the band was much earlier, in 1979, in a three-minute skit on a short-lived series spearheaded by Reiner: <em>The T.V. Show.</em></p><p>The skit, about a heavy-metal trio called Spinal Tap, grew out of an experience Guest had in a hotel lobby in England, when he found himself eavesdropping on the idiotic back-and-forth of a group of aging rockers. When the group decided to make a feature film about Spinal Tap, they created a 20-minute demo, complete with costumes and musical numbers, to shop around Hollywood in lieu of a script. The fact that the characters were fully realized, with backstories and music and lyrics, before the film was pitched is proof that it wasn't work for hire, the plaintiffs' latest filing asserts. “Copyrights to these works belonged, unencumbered, to the creators,” it says.</p><p>Several Tap songs, including “Big Bottom,” “Stonehenge,” and “Sex Farm,” appeared in the demo. The band also performed a few practice gigs before unsuspecting crowds at places like The Whisky a Go Go on Sunset Boulevard. At one show, Spinal Tap was supposed to open for Iron Butterfly, of “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” fame, but a member of that band had a dentist appointment early the next morning, so Butterfly went on first. Surreally, Shearer says, “they opened for us.”</p><div data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GenericCallout&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GenericCallout&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><figure><figcaption data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Caption&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Caption&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><span><p>David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) in 1992.</p>
</span><span>Henry Diltz / Morrison Hotel Gallery</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Once the demo was complete, Reiner—who was to direct the film—traded on his recognizable name to book meetings with the production heads at every major studio in town. Shearer says each meeting went the same way: “We walk in, everybody shakes hands, the lights go down, and this thing shows for 20 minutes. The lights come up, and it's blank stares, like, ‘What was that?’ ” When the foursome explained that the film would follow a fake, past-its-prime metal band on a U.S. tour, they were told that rock 'n' roll movies didn't make money. Every major studio turned them down. (But the demo—produced before any contract was signed—still exists: “I think it was included as a DVD extra in one of the many editions that were churned out for a film that ‘never made any money,’ ” Shearer says with a smirk.)</p></div></div><div><div><p>Eventually, <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/norman-lear-the-comedy-godfather-of-television"><em>All in the Family</em> creator Norman Lear</a> and his partner, Jerry Perenchio, green-lighted <em>Spinal Tap</em> at their tiny indie studio, Embassy Pictures. Instead of a script, there was a written breakdown of scenes: “basically, just stage directions for the crew to know who is in it and what they're shooting,” Shearer says. Paul Shaffer, who played Artie Fufkin, the Midwest promotions rep for Spinal Tap's label, recalls that before shooting began, he asked Shearer, “Will I be getting the lines in advance?” Shearer replied, “You'll be making them up, sir.” This lack of dialogue made for bizarre auditions—the members of the band would improvise conversations with the actors trying out for the roles—but the resulting cast was stacked with comedy's rising stars, including Fred Willard, Fran Drescher, Billy Crystal, and Dana Carvey.</p><p>To prepare for the scenes in which Reiner, playing the documentarian Marty DiBergi, interviewed the band members, they assembled an elaborate 17-year history of the group—a bible for each to memorize so they could keep their stories straight. “It was absolutely vital because we didn't know what questions Rob was going to ask,” McKean told <em>The Washington Post</em> the year the movie came out. “But we did know the answers.” The bible included all their past album titles (among them: <em>Intravenus de Milo</em> and <em>The Sun Never Sweats</em>) and other details that would (or would not) emerge in the film, such as the fact that Spinal Tap had once been called the Originals, then the New Originals, and then the Thamesmen.</p><p>What appealed to the foursome was not merely the potential for hilarity but also something not usually associated with spoofs: the chance to get their subject right. They were dead serious about rock 'n' roll, and it bugged them how movies about the music business never seemed to capture the true sights, sounds, and smells of hardworking musicians on the road. “The little touches add up, and that was a lot of the joy in the project,” Guest told the <em>Post</em>. “People out here in Hollywood have a tendency to say nobody will notice, nobody will care, nobody will see that, and our contention was completely the opposite. It got very technical and very bizarre at times, but we had to stick to our guns.”</p><p>The band members were unrelenting in their pursuit of authenticity. One day, they were scheduled to shoot a scene backstage in a club; the stage directions called for “typical backstage graffiti” on the walls. “We walk in,” Shearer says, “and it looks like the art director has visited freeway underpasses near Mexican-gang areas. So we say, ‘No, no. Here is the phone number of the Troubadour,’ ” a famous L.A. club. “ ‘Go to the Troubadour, and go upstairs. We'll wait.’ ” Only when the set was redecorated did the cameras roll.</p><p>The crew included the cinematographer who'd shot <em>Gimme Shelter,</em> a production designer who'd worked with Santana, and a lighting designer who'd collaborated with the band Boston. All the instruments that Shearer, McKean, and Guest played—and, yes, that's them actually playing—were period-appropriate, as were the microphones. U2 guitarist the Edge said that when he first saw <em>Spinal Tap,</em> “I didn't laugh, I wept”—because it captured the ethos of the music business so perfectly.</p><div data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GroupCallout&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GroupCallout&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><figure><figcaption data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Caption&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Caption&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><span><p>The members of Spinal Tap in...</p>

</span><span>David Corio</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Once all the footage was edited, Guest, McKean, Reiner, and Shearer delivered it to the studio more or less as a finished product. Since then, the film has had more owners than Kiss has had revival tours. After Embassy Pictures, the film was owned for a time by Coca-Cola, then by Dino De Laurentiis, and then, according to Shearer, by a subsidiary of L'Oréal called Parafrance, in response to which the Tap creators formed a company called Parapants. “At that point, our basic mode of attack was just ridicule, because we didn't think there was anything else we could do.” In or around 1989, <em>This Is Spinal Tap</em> was sold to Studiocanal, which was then bought by Vivendi.</p><inline-embed childtypes="" name="dropcap"><p>At a bookstore in New Orleans's Garden District, a fan approaches Shearer. “I saw you 18 years ago, when you showed up as Derek Smalls at the Maple Leaf,” the guy says, but Shearer tells the man he is mistaken. “I can tell you the two times that Derek has been in New Orleans,” he says, ticking off a Sunday morning in 1993, when the band played a merchandising convention at the local Marriott, and then “last year, at one in the morning, one night during Jazz Fest, Derek made an appearance with Snarky Puppy at The Howlin' Wolf. Those are the only two times.”</p></inline-embed><p>Over the years, the band members have reprised their roles on several occasions, and they've kept adding to their characters' backstories. Smalls, for example, has been in therapy for an Internet addiction, has worked as a substitute crossing guard in L.A., and has long been obsessed with trying to breed a black carnation. For the most part, though, everyone is busy with other projects. McKean is a regular on the AMC series <em>Better Call Saul</em>; Guest and Reiner are directing their own films; Shearer is hosting a weekly radio show, doing voices for <em>The Simpsons,</em> developing his own animated series, and working on a memoir. (Will it be a tell-all? I ask. “I'm going to tell some tales, yeah,” he says. “It's not a revenge document, but I'm not going to use whole gallons of varnish, either.”)</p><div data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GenericCallout&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GenericCallout&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><figure><figcaption data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Caption&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;Caption&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><span><p>Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) on set.</p>
</span><span>Embassy Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The foursome are cordial, though there have been tensions. In 2014, discussions broke down over a proposed Spinal Tap 30th-anniversary live tour. But in its way, the suit has brought the boys back together. Shearer tells me he alerted everyone to his intention to file through Guest, with whom he maintains the closest ties. After the initial complaint was made public, the band members made statements of support, then discussed joining the action via telephone tree. Shearer says Reiner called him, then Reiner called McKean, and so on. “It was never all of us in a room at the same time,” Shearer says. “Anybody who's been in a band knows that cat herding is easy by comparison.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Like Shearer, none of the other members of Spinal Tap are in desperate need of money; they've joined the lawsuit in part to make a lasting impact on the way entertainment conglomerates do business. “Look,” Shearer says, “one can be grandiose and hope that if this is an unpleasant enough experience for Vivendi, other companies might decide to be fairer to creative people, since creative people are the cause and the source of any money they make. I'm not enough of a dreamer to think that automatically is going to happen. But if Art Buchwald had never sued, maybe other people wouldn't have gotten into the habit of suing.”</p><p>In the meantime, Tap fans will be interested to know that Derek Smalls is hard at work on a new project: his first solo album. The septuagenarian bassist is finally stepping out on his own, with songs that shed light on the travails of partying hard in one's twilight years. Already, more than a few real rockers have recorded cameos (Steely Dan's Donald Fagen, for example, sings the bridge on “Memo to Willie,” a little ditty about erectile dysfunction; Peter Frampton and Steve Vai are also on board). There's a song called “MRI,” and another called “It Don’t Get Old,” which describes the decaying pleasures of life on the road. <em>Smalls Change</em> (as it's tentatively titled) is aiming for a release later this year. When it does appear, Shearer—in a glittery outfit, with a wig and muttonchops gone horror-movie white—plans a live tour to support it. No word yet on whether he'll ask Vivendi for permission.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared in the June 2017 issue with the title "Spinal Tap vs. Hollywood."</em></p><hr><p>Introducing GQ Backstory, amplified by American Express:</p><p>Listen to exclusive audio content from GQ editors</p><figure data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;IframeEmbed&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;IframeEmbed&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><div></div></figure></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
