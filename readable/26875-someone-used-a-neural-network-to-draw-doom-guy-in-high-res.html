And while the resulting thread reveals that the process wasn’t as straightforward as it seems, the image is still a startling example at how adept artificial intelligence has&nbsp;become at filling in the gaps in a low-fidelity input — and spitting out something new and convincing.</p><figure id="attachment_163888" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163888" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-163888 size-full" src="https://wp-assets.futurism.com/2019/06/xok26jqf7q431.png" alt="" width="960" height="960"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-163888" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/c1a9vc/neural_network_generated_drawings_of_the_man_from/">1MightBeAPenguin/Reddit</a></figcaption></figure><h2>Step By Step</h2><p>The final image is actually the product of several AI systems taking the improving on one another. According to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/c1a9vc/neural_network_generated_drawings_of_the_man_from/ercpve4/">Reddit thread</a>, the original “Doom Guy” sprite was fed into the AI of photo-editing programs including FaceApp, Waifu2x, and GIMP. That resulted in an improved, but still very pixelated and maybe pinkeye-infected <a href="https://i.redd.it/c761yzybz0lz.png">version of the face</a>.</p><p>From there, the image was fed into StyleGAN, the Nvidia AI system that people have used to <a href="https://futurism.com/incredibly-realistic-faces-generated-neural-network">create photorealistic portraits</a> and nightmarish <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/neural-network-pokemon">Pokémon sprites</a>. StyleGAN churned out a more <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D7VKYhJU0AEGJIN.jpg">realistic image</a> then took another pass to <a href="but%20the%20artistic%20style%20of%20the%20original%20design%20left%20the%20man%20with%20unrealistic%20dimensions%20so">smooth it out</a>. But because the original sprite had unrealistic proportions, the new image was manually reshaped, into this <a href="https://i.redd.it/hr0pt7rev9031.png">final version</a>.</p><h2>The Short Version</h2><p>Basically, one algorithm couldn’t take the pixelated blob that is Doom Guy and turn it into a real-looking face — it took a few steps to get there.</p><p>But once that process is set up, AI can do some cool stuff — the original Reddit post, for instance, shows how editing teeth into the pixelated sprite convinces the AI to create a very different portrait, reshaping Doom Guy’s entire expression into a big beaming smile.</p><p><strong>More on StyleGAN: </strong><em><a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/site-tests-spot-ai-generated-faces">This Site Tests Whether You Can Spot AI-Generated Faces</a></em></p></div></div></div></div>
