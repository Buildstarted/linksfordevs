    Collapse OS' first incarnation was written in Z80 assembler. One of the
    first feedbacks I had after it went viral was "why not Forth?". I briefly
    looked at it and it didn't seem such a great choice at first, so I first
    dismissed it. Then, I had what alcoholics refer to as a
    <a href="https://github.com/hsoft/collapseos/issues/4">"Moment of clarity"</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Forth is a stellar fit to Collapse OS design goals. If you're not familiar
    with it, it might be hard to understand why. Let me try to explain.
</p>
<h2>What it's not</h2>
<p>
    Some Forth enthusiasts like the language for itself. They think that its
    easier to express much of the logic of a program in this language. Many
    books and tutorials are touting this.
</p>
<p>
    That's not my opinion. Forth is a fine and capable language, but I tend to
    agree with those who say that it tends to produce write-only programs.
    Most of the books on Forth are very old and compare Forth's elegance to
    Fortran's or COBOL's. I'm of the opinion that C is more expressive and
    generally produce more elegant and maintainable code.
</p>
<p>
    When you look for Forth's advantages, don't look there.
</p>
<p>
    Forth isn't particularly fast either. As an interpreted language, it is
    blazing fast, but the speed tax of the indirect threaded model still has
    to be paid, so it will generally be slower than code produced by a C
    compiler.
</p>
<p>
    However, as a Python developer, I know this tradeoff well. It's not 100%
    of your program that needs to be fast, only bottlenecks. Like with Python,
    it's easy in Forth to write bottlenecks in native code. Therefore, speed
    is not such a big issue.
</p>
<h2>What it is</h2>
<p>
    Forth is, to my knowledge, the most <em>compact</em> language allowing
    high level constructs. It is so compact that Collapse OS' Forth implementation
    achieves self-hosting with about the same amount of resources than its
    assembler counterpart!
</p>
<p>
    <em>What is this sorcery?</em> At face value, nothing can be more compact
    than native code. It's self-evident. If a piece of Forth code is doing the
    exact same piece of logic in a way that is as compact as native code, you've
    been lazy on your assembly writing!
</p>
<p>
    To understand this compactness, we have to look deeper.
</p>
<p>
    The Z80 asm version of Collapse OS self-hosts on a RC2014 with a 5K shell on
    ROM, a 5K assembler binary loaded in RAM from SD card (but that could be in
    ROM, that's why I count it as ROM in my project's feature highlights) and 8K
    of RAM. That is, it can assemble itself from source within those resources.
</p>
<p>
    The biggest piece of software to assemble is the assembler itself. It's a
    reasonably well-featured assembler that supports forward labels, includes,
    many useful directives. The code implementing those features requires those
    aforementioned resources to assemble.
</p>
<p>
    ...But also, the features included in the assembler are required to assemble
    its source code! I could cut a bit on its features to reduce resource
    usage, but I'd need to adapt the assembler's code for this lack of features
    and possibly make the code much more complex. I believe that with this
    assembler, I stroke a good balance and achieved something close to optimal.
</p>
<p>
    If I wanted to re-implement that assembler feature-for-feature in Forth, it
    would probably require much more resources to build. Even though higher
    level words are more compact, the base of the pyramid to get there couldn't
    compete with the straight assembler version. This was under this reasoning
    that I first dismissed Forth.
</p>

<p>
    So, again, what makes Forth more compact than assembler?
    <em>Simplicity.</em> The particularity of Forth is that it begins "walking
    by itself", that is, implementing its own words from its base set, very,
    <em>very</em> early. This means that only a tiny part of it needs to be
    assembled into native code. This tiny part of native code requires much
    less tooling, and thus an assembler with much less features. This assembler
    requires less RAM.
</p>
<p>
    What is more compact than something that doesn't exist? Even Z80 assembler
    can't beat the void.
</p>
<p>
    That's how although Forth is not more compact that native code (duh!),
    <em>a Forth Collapse OS achieves self-hosting with as much resources than
    its Z80 counterpart</em>.
</p>
<p>
    So for the very low price of manageable speed constraints, we get a high
    level language that is much more powerful and extensible than the BASIC
    shell that was previously there. I call that a definite win.
</p>
<h2>Cherry on top</h2>
<p>
    Because compactness has always been a primary design goal of Collapse OS,
    I initially chose Z80 assembler over high level languages so that I could
    continue to meet that design goal.
</p>
<p>
    However, now that I can have my cake and eat it too, thanks to Forth, new
    opportunities open. First and foremost, multiple architectures! Although
    I was ready to give that up when I tied myself to the Z80, I'm now very
    glad to have it and will certainly take advantage of it.
</p>
<h2>Culture of simplicity</h2>
<p>
    Forth's culture of simplicity is worth writing about. At face value, a
    traditional Forth environment is severly constrained according to modern
    standards.
</p>
<p>
    Who would want to work within the constraint of 64x16 blocks filesystem?
    Someone who knows the complexity associated with implementing a filesystem
    and everything that underpins it. When simplicity is valued, such
    constraints are gladly accepted.
</p>
<p>
    We can't say that asceticism is a dominant trait of our relation to
    technology. We aren't used at all to willingly accept constraints with
    regards to what we could call our convenience. Why would anyone not want a
    piece of software or hardware to be easier to use, more accessible to the
    layman, more featureful? If someone is willing to build that complexity,
    Moore's law allow us to adopt it, and we do. This leads to cancerous
    complexity, layers upon layers upon layers with each new generation of
    developers blissfully accepting the previous layers.
</p>
<p>
    (Something analogous can probably be said about our collapsing civilization,
    and probably even eloquently quote Joseph Tainter)
</p>
<p>
    The base design of Forth is entirely built around a <em>primal
    simplicity</em>. Even better, the path of least resistance generally guides
    you towards simplicity. When a word definition becomes too big and
    complicated, it generally prompts you to reorganize your code toward a
    simpler solution that might not have occurred to you in another language.
</p>
<p>
    To be clear: Forth doesn't elegantly describe complex algorithms, at least
    not when compared to languages like C. Those generally make the head hurt
    when reading. However, this mental pain does makes you question your need
    for complexity and encourages "sideways" solutions.
</p>
<p>
    This is something that I think few developers are familiar with and
    is hard to describe with words. It needs to be experienced. One of the
    good ways to experience it I think is to implement your own Forth.
