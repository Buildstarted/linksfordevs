    <h1>ZKProof Standards</h1>
    <div id="content"> <p>Zero Knowledge Proofs are a cutting edge cryptographic tool that is starting to see adoption. This breakthrough technology forms the basis of several cryptographic applications, improving the trade-offs between data privacy and integrity. Zero Knowledge Proofs allow a prover to convince a verifier that some computational statement is correct without revealing any information except the veracity of the statement. </p> <p><a href="http://zkproof.org">ZKProof.org</a> is an open initiative of industry and academia to standardize the use of zero knowledge proofs. We are planning several workshops to standardize the security, implementation, applications and all other related aspects of this technology. </p> <ul> <li>The <a href="first_workshop.html">first workshop</a> took place in Boston and brought together academic and industry experts in the field. </li> <li>The <a href="workshop2/main.html">second workshop</a> took place in Berkeley and jump-started the process of standardization and consolidated the Community Reference document.</li> <li>The <a href="workshop3/main.html">third workshop</a> will take place, for the first time in Europe, in London, UK on April 4-6 2020 <a href="workshop3/registration.html">Save your spot now!</a></li> </ul> <p>Join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/zkproof.org/forum/?hl=en#!forum/zkproof-standards-community"> ZKProof Standards Community mailing list</a> to keep up to date with all the developments. We encourage researchers, developers, practitioners, businessmen and women, and others to <a href="contact.html">join us</a>, get involved and contribute to the effort.</p> <h3> Steering Committee Members: </h3> </div>
