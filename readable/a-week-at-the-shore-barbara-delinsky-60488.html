<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p><strong>In her new bestseller, NYT bestselling Barbara Delinsky explores how lives and relationships are forever changed when three sisters reunite at their family Rhode Island beach house.</strong></p>
<p>One phone call is all it takes to lure real estate photographer Mallory Aldiss back to her family Rhode Island beach home. It's been twenty years since she's been gone—running from the scandal that destroyed her parents' marriage, drove her and her two sisters apart, and crushed her relationship with her first love. But going home is fraught with emotional baggage—memories, mysteries and secrets abound.</p>
<p>Mal's thirteen-year-old daughter, Joy, has never been to the place where Mal's life was shaped and is desperate to go. Fatherless, she craves family and especially wants to spend time with the grandfather she barely knows.</p>
<p>In just seven watershed days on the Rhode Island coast three women will test the bonds of sisterhood, friendship and family, and discover the role that love and memory plays in defining their lives.</p>

<p><strong>Backstory</strong></p>
<p>Imagine traveling to your favorite place – and being able to stay there not for a week or two, but for a year and a half! That’s where at A Week at the Shore began. Before I had any idea what the book would be about, I decided to set it on the Rhode Island shore. It’s a spot that my family loves, and the thought of living there, virtually speaking, for however long it took to conceive and plot and write the book, excited me.</p>
<p>Then came memory. Given that I’m a psychologist at heart, I’ve always wanted to write a book about how memory can be spot-on or all wrong, how it can based on reality or dreamed up, how it can change with time or be completely repressed.</p>
<p>And the people experiencing these memories? Sisters. I’m one of three, and the dynamic between us intrigues me. Same with the Aldiss sisters in A Week at the Shore. When they come together at the start of the book, after twenty years apart, they bring very different memories of many of the same events. I was fascinated watching them reconcile those difference. Hopefully, you will be, too.</p>
