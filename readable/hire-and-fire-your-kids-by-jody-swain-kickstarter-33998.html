<p>Are you tired of nagging your kids?&nbsp; Sick of the clothes on the floor?&nbsp; Had enough of their behaviour, &nbsp;whining or fighting and not listening? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I was too.&nbsp; So I developed a behavior and chore game-like system that has CHANGED OUR LIVES and other families’ lives for the better.&nbsp; I've shared the system with neighbours, friends, co-workers and even strangers and every single family has praised it's benefits.&nbsp; Every. single. family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn't until I was let go from my 20+ year corporate job in retail that I realized just how much I believed in the system. &nbsp;I was home with the kids playing the game and realized I wanted to share this idea with the world and pursue it as a real business. &nbsp;Seeing how well it worked for us and those around me, I truly and honestly wanted to help more families. &nbsp;So I spent over a year&nbsp;and all of my severance building it into a mobile app! &nbsp;An app we believe will become the <em>future of parenting in a digital age</em>!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>THE APP - </strong>&nbsp;allows Kids to "Apply" to Jobs (chores) for HIRE and avoid getting FIRED by following the Behavioural Expectations set in the home. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine your Kids WANTING to help around the house, WANTING to behave better and actually signing up for chores on their own without you having to constantly nag at them or repeat yourself a million times!</p>
<p>Our game motivates the Kids to take initiative vs. parents assigning or telling their Kids what to do. &nbsp;We use Recognition, Reward &amp; Discipline, teaching the Kids how to respect your family values, how to be a team player, be responsible and be accountable. &nbsp;All while preparing them for the important skills they'll need when they get out in the real world.</p>
<p>The Kids love choosing from the HFK characters within the app and enjoy playing “employee”, earning their “pay day allowance“ and competing for the coveted Employee Of The Month reward! &nbsp;And parents love seeing their Kids taking the initiative, learning to take responsibility, work together, having fun and feeling proud of their accomplishments.</p>

<p><strong>WHY AM I ASKING FOR HELP?</strong> &nbsp;I've spent my money building the app as a MVP. &nbsp;HFK is available for sale today in both the App Store and Google Play. &nbsp;Going forward, not only do I need help with marketing and PR to help grow this business, but I will be expanding the app's functionality based on Beta Testing finds and to include more fun features like "vacation days", "sick days" "overtime", and reloadable 'pre-paid cash cards" (<a href="https://hireandfireyourkids.com/new-versions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://hireandfireyourkids.com/new-versions</a>)! &nbsp;The money raised here will go towards these areas and will allow you and other families to enjoy the coolest parenting, chore and behavior app on the market.</p>
<p><strong>WHY DO I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THIS?</strong> &nbsp;Our digital world is rapidly changing, the app is a playful solution to communicate as a family, driving awareness around values/expectations and contributing to the home in a gaming format. &nbsp;I've seen how HFK changes a family dynamic , how it builds teamwork among family members, how it brings the family closer together, reduces family friction and how it prepares Kids for the real world - learning about financial literacy, recognition and how positive behaviors and hard work are rewarded. &nbsp;I've never been more passionate about anything in my life. &nbsp;I'm a first time entrepreneur and have fully embraced it, learning and growing everyday! &nbsp;I've been working harder at this than I ever have in my 20+ years in my corporate career.</p>

<p><strong>WITH THESE FUNDS, HOW WILL I MAKE MY GOALS HAPPEN? </strong>We've had a lot of interest with the media, pitched on Dragon's Den - episode airs Thursday October 24th at 9pm and other media found here: <a href="https://hireandfireyourkids.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://hireandfireyourkids.com/media</a>. &nbsp;Our name definitely intrigues people and captures attention! &nbsp;We plan to use the money to launch a marketing campaign and work with influencers, experts, educators and the media alike to expand across the Country promoting Hire and Fire your Kids and driving the brand awareness. &nbsp;We have already had behavioural analysts, psycologists, behavioural consultants, social workers and Registered Early Childhood Educators who have recommended Hire and Fire your Kids. &nbsp;As well as numerous testimonials from our "test families" <a href="https://hireandfireyourkids.com/testimonials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://hireandfireyourkids.com/testimonials</a> . &nbsp;The more eyes we can get on us the better!
