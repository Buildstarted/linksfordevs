How did it achieve such miraculous speed and comfort improvements in a mere six months?</p><p>They paved it. </p><p>Yes, for those keeping score, in a mere two years we’ve gone from a futuristic vision of electric skates zooming around a variety of vehicles in a network of underground tunnels to—and I cannot stress this enough—a very small, paved tunnel that can fit one (1) car.</p><p>The video’s marketing conceit is that the car in the tunnel beats a car trying to go the same distance on roads. You’ll never believe this, but the car that has a dedicated right of way wins. Congratulations to The Boring Company for proving dedicated rights of way are important for speedy transportation, something transportation planners figured out roughly two centuries ago. I’m afraid for how many tunnels they’ll have to dig before they likewise acknowledge the validity of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/09/citylab-university-induced-demand/569455/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/09/citylab-university-induced-demand/569455/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">induced demand</a></span>.<br></p><p>Indeed, The Boring Company hasn’t just given up on the sleds in the test track. The company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-boring-company-secures-48-6-million-contrac-1834971506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-boring-company-secures-48-6-million-contrac-1834971506">recently signed a $48.6 million contract</a></span> with Las Vegas to build a short people-mover through their convention center. But, as Curbed’s Alissa Walker has been pointing out, that plan is also for the familiar technology of cars with rubber tires in tunnels on pavement.</p><p>Why did Musk give up on his sled dream? Why was the tunnel paved over? Here’s from the man himself:<br></p><p>To recap: Musk’s company spent two years developing a very narrow car tunnel. To anyone who ever believed Elon Musk’s bullshit: you’ve been had.</p><p><strong>Update 7:31 p.m.</strong>: This story has been updated to clarify The Boring Company’s relationship to Hyperloops.<br></p></div></div></div>
