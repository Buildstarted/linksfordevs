 The <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom">Game Engine Black Book: DOOM</a> features a whole chapter about DOOM console ports and the challenges they encountered. The utter failure of the 3DO, the difficulties of the Saturn due to its affine texture mapping, and the amazing "reverse-engineering-from- scratch" by Randy Linden on Super Nintendo all have rich stories to tell.</p><p>
 
  Once heading towards disaster<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, the Playstation 1 (PSX) devteam managed to rectify course to produce a critically and commercially acclaimed conversion. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85npx14HUI">Final DOOM</a> was the most faithful port when compared to the PC version. The alpha blended colored sectors not only improved visual quality, they also made gameplay better by indicating the required key color. Sound was also improved via reverberation effects taking advantage of the PSX's Audio Processing Unit.</p><p>
 
 The devteam did such a good job that they found themselves with a few extra CPU cycles they decided to use to generate animated fire both during both the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJB0gfP-GRY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10">intro</a> and the <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/psx_screen_sky.png">gameplay</a>. Mesmerized, I tried to find out how it was done. After an initial calling found no answer, I was about to dust off my MIPS book to rip open the PSX executable when Samuel Villarreal replied on Twitter to tell me he had already reverse-engineered the Nintendo 64 version<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. I only had to clean, simplify, and optimize it a little  bit.</p><p>
 
 It was interesting to re-discover this classic demoscene effect; the underlying idea is similar to the first <a href="http://agilerepose.weebly.com/water-ripple.html">water ripple</a> many developers implemented as a programming kata in the 90's. The fire effect is a vibrant testimony to a time when judiciously picked palette colors combined with a simple trick were the only way to get things done.
</p></div>


<p><b>Core idea</b></p><hr>
<div><p>
At its core, the fire effect relies on a simple heightmap. A screen-sized array is populated with thirty-seven values ranging from 0 to 36. Each value is associated with a color from white to black, using yellow, orange, and red along the way. The idea is to model the fire particle's temperature as it elevates and cools down.</p><table><tbody><tr>

The framebuffer is initialized full black (with zeros) with a single line of white pixels at the bottom (36) which will be the "source" of the fire.</p><picture>
    <source srcset="basis.webp" type="image/webp">
    <img src="http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/basis.png" type="image/png">
  </picture> <p>

For each screen refresh the "heat" is propagated up. A new value for each pixel in the framebuffer is calculated. Each pixel is updated based on the value directly below. In the code, upper-left is at array index zero and lower-right is at index FIRE_HEIGHT * FIRE_WIDTH - 1.
</p></div><pre><span>function</span> doFire<span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span><span>(</span>x<span>=</span><span>0</span> <span>;</span> x <span>&lt;</span> FIRE_WIDTH<span>;</span> x<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>(</span>y <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> y <span>&lt;</span> FIRE_HEIGHT<span>;</span> y<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            spreadFire<span>(</span>y <span>*</span> FIRE_WIDTH <span>+</span> x<span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
 <span>}</span>

 <span>function</span> spreadFire<span>(</span>src<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    firePixels<span>[</span>src <span>-</span> FIRE_WIDTH<span>]</span> <span>=</span> firePixels<span>[</span>src<span>]</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
 <span>}</span>
</pre>
<div><p>
Notice that line 0 is never updated (y iteration starts at 1 instead of 0). This line populated with zeros is the "generator" of fire. This simple version with linear cooling (-=1) yields a boring uniform output.</p><picture>

We can tweak the spreadFire() function a little bit and change how fast a heat points decays. Adding randomness works well.
</p></div><pre> <span>function</span> spreadFire<span>(</span>src<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> rand <span>=</span> <span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>round</span><span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>3.0</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
    firePixels<span>[</span>src <span>-</span> FIRE_WIDTH <span>]</span> <span>=</span> firePixels<span>[</span>src<span>]</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span>rand <span>&amp;</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
 <span>}</span>
</pre>


<div>
   
<p><img src="http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/variable_decay.png" type="image/png"></p><p>

That's better. To improve the illusion further, the heat can be randomly propagated to go not only above but also left and right.</p></div><pre> <span>function</span> spreadFire<span>(</span>src<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> rand <span>=</span> <span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>round</span><span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>3.0</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
    <span>var</span> dst <span>=</span> src <span>-</span> rand <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    firePixels<span>[</span>dst <span>-</span> FIRE_WIDTH <span>]</span> <span>=</span> firePixels<span>[</span>src<span>]</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span>rand <span>&amp;</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
 <span>}</span>
</pre>

Et voila! Notice that by adjusting how the fire propagates up, wind can also be simulated. I will leave that as an exercise for the readers who had the courage to read up to here.
