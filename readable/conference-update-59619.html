                                    <p>The health and safety of our community is our first priority. As a result of the global COVID-19 virus situation we are transforming our upcoming 2020 events to online. We know an online event canâ€™t fully replace an in-person event, but we are working hard to ensure our online events will be of the highest quality. Our fantastic speakers are committed to doing whatever it takes. We are so grateful for your loyalty, and support of the developer community.</p><p>People who have purchased tickets can choose between the following options:</p><ul><li>Take part in the online event and be refunded the price difference between the online ticket and the paid ticket</li><li>Take part in the online event and receive a 50% off voucher for any future NDC conference</li><li>Receive a full ticket refund</li></ul><p>Needless to say, we hope you will take part in our online events. Not only do we anticipate excellent workshops and presentations, but doing so will help ensure we can return to our live-in- person events as soon as it is safe for everyone to attend.</p><p>If you have any questions please contact us at <a>info@ndcconferences.com</a>. All emails will be answered.</p><p>Our thoughts are with the many people who have been infected, have friends, colleagues, and relatives who have been infected, and everyone in the high-risk groups.</p><p>Kind regards</p><p>Jakob Bradford <br>CEO <br>NDC Conferences</p>
