          <p>
    Computer games were big with Apple employees, too. "The early Apple staff, starting with Woz [Steve Wozniak], loved playing and creating games," Hertzfeld
    recalls. "Many of the Apple engineers spent a fair percentage of their time playing the latest hot game [on the Apple II computer]."
</p>
<p>
    Games were also a fun and effective way to test the Mac's work-in-progress graphical user interface, with its mouse input and desktop metaphors that stood
    in stark opposition to the text-only command-line interfaces on the IBM PC, Apple II, Commodore 64, and other personal computers at the time.
</p>
<p>
    "One of the earliest Mac demo programs I wrote was a version of <em>Breakout</em>, the classic Atari/Apple II game," says Hertzfeld. He wrote his homage in
    April 1981 on an early Mac prototype. "We hardly had any software running on the Mac and [I] thought that it would be nice to have a mouse-based game," he
    explains. It seemed a fitting gesture, given the game's history, to have it help in some small way to shape the future of computing (again).
</p>
<p>
    "It only took a day or two to write initially," Hertzfeld recalls. "After I had it going, [Apple Mac team colleague] Bud Tribble suggested that I spice it
    up by having the bricks fall when they were hit by the ball instead of disappearing, and you'd have to dodge them as they fell since you'd lose your ball
    if they hit your paddle.
</p>
<p>
    "I also made a nice explosion when a falling brick hit the paddle. It was fun to play, but was written in a low-level, stand-alone fashion and not
    maintained as the system software evolved.”
</p>
<p>
    Other Mac team members also made games to test hardware and software features. In 1984, after the first Mac came out, programmer Gene Tyacke developed a
    version of Greg Thompson and Dave Colley's (among many others') primitive first-person shooter <em>Maze War</em> to test the in-development AppleTalk
networking feature that allowed multiple Macs to share files and send messages to each other across a cable connected to the printer port.    <em>Bus'd Out</em> was later leaked out unfinished, but not before Burt Sloane, a programmer in a different Mac department, independently created a version
of his own that eventually became <em>Maze Wars+</em>, one of the first commercially-available network games. (See Chapter 15 for more on    <em>Maze Wars+</em> and the Mac’s role in the growth of network games.)
</p>
<p>
    Games were more than a fun testing ground for software development on the Mac. An early business plan called for a minimum of two “Macintosh quality” games
    that would be “unlike the world has ever seen” because “it further endears the office user to his Mac, titillates the college user, and provides a reason
    for office types to carry their Macs home to their family.”
</p>
<p>
One of those "Macintosh quality" games was being developed by Bill Budge, who had just found huge success on the Apple II with    <em>Pinball Construction Kit</em> — a game in which players could craft their own virtual pinball tables and then play them. Budge was given an early
    Macintosh, well before its official release. He recalls that the original Mac "had a pretty fast CPU combined with a relatively small screen. That made it
    possible to paint the screen fast enough to do good 3D animation." To that end, Budge was making a flight simulator. "I actually got a demo working that
    approached a runway for landing and had an impressive frame rate for the time."
</p>
<p>
    It never came to anything. "I abandoned the project because the display was only black and white, so grey scales had to be simulated by dithering or
    patterning, which didn't look that great," he says. "And because it would have been a lot of work to import the geographical database and I lost interest."
</p>
<p>
    The creator of the other launch-ready Macintosh-quality game followed through, however, and that game came from within the company. Everybody at Apple
    played Steve Capps' computer game. <em>Alice</em> combined the careful strategy of the ancient game of kings with the speed and immediacy of
    quarter-guzzling modern arcades. It was an <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>-themed reimagining of chess wherein Alice herself stood in for the white pieces.
    She faced down the red queen's army on the other side of the board, and the player could click on the board to tell her where to go. If the square clicked
    on was a legal chess move for the type of piece Alice was acting as, she'd hop there. If an enemy piece occupied that space, it would disappear. The end
    goal was to clear the board of all enemy pieces.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike chess, <em>Alice</em> moved at break-neck speed. Enemy pieces hopped about without waiting even a second for the player to complete his move. The
    pieces themselves combined the basic appearance of traditional chess pieces with the illustrative style of Sir John Tenniel, who had illustrated the
    original <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> and <em>Through the Looking Glass</em> books. They were drawn in black and white, as was the faux-3D chessboard that
    floated on a black background.
</p>
<p>
    Capps' <em>Alice</em> had the Macintosh and Lisa software teams captivated. One person in particular took to <em>Alice</em> like glue. Joanna Hoffman, the
    Mac's first marketing person, was indisputably the best player. But she found the game too easy and pressured Capps to make it tougher. He tweaked
    parameters and added features, including a special mode where the board became invisible. He did whatever was necessary to keep his friends from getting
    bored of his game, and those changes all stuck for the final release.
</p>
<p>
    "The problem was that I was designing it for people who were expert <em>Alice</em> users," he explains, "so for the person that first picked it up it was
    actually frustratingly, shittily hard. To the point that I blew it." More than anything, <em>Alice</em> was brutally difficult because it assumed its
    player had already mastered the art of pointing and clicking.
</p>
<p>
    Most people who bought a Macintosh had never used a mouse before, nor had many even tried to operate a computer. They had to learn from scratch even things
    that are as fundamental as moving a mouse cursor and clicking to select a file or reposition a text prompt, or double clicking to open something, or any
    manner of other actions computer users take for granted today.
</p>
<p>
    Apple had conducted user tests prior to the release of the Macintosh to see how people fared in setting it up and learning to operate the system without
    any guidance. Capps recalls one tester who got his running without a hitch but held the mouse such that the cord ran out the bottom instead of the top and
    his palm rested over the button.
</p>
<p>
    "The guy had never touched a mouse before," Capps says. "He's sitting there and he moves it to the right and the cursor moves to the left. And he moves the
    mouse up and the cursor moves down. So it's essentially backwards. Thinking of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, he's fallen through the looking glass, and he
    teaches himself to use it in the half an hour there."
</p>
<p>
    Asked afterwards what he thought of the Mac, the man said, "You know, I didn't understand why it was backwards like that. But I got used to it, so I think
    you guys got a great product there."
