You can check it out on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/samples" data-linktype="external">docs.microsoft.com/samples</a>. With this release, we aim to make it easier for you to discover relevant code examples to get started, no matter what Microsoft product or service you're using.</p><p><img src="media/code-samples/sample-page-new.gif" alt="Samples browser on docs.microsoft.com" data-linktype="relative-path"></p><p>Starting today, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/samples" data-linktype="external">docs.microsoft.com/samples</a> is the place where you find the most up-to-date code samples relevant to your workflows. We've made sure that we powered the hosted content and search by code hosted on <a href="https://github.com" data-linktype="external">GitHub</a> - you can contribute to any of the samples we index by going to the repository and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests" data-linktype="external">opening a pull request</a>! Found a bug in the sample as you were running it? You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue" data-linktype="external">open an issue</a> in the repository where the sample is as well, and the team managing the code will be able to look at it!</p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/samples" data-linktype="external">Try the new samples browser</a></p><p>The new site also brings you a range of benefits, outlined below, making it easier than ever to embark on your development journey.</p><h2 id="one-click-azure-deployment">One-click Azure deployment</h2><p>We host multiple samples that have built-in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates" data-linktype="external">Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates</a> associated with them. Now, you can deploy those samples to Azure directly from the page on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com" data-linktype="external">docs.microsoft.com</a> - in one click!</p><p><img src="media/code-samples/deploy-to-azure.gif" alt="One-click deployment of a code sample to Azure" data-linktype="relative-path"></p><h2 id="download-just-what-you-need">Download just what you need</h2><p>How many times were you in the situation where you wanted to look at just one sample from a repository that contains tens of them, but had to clone all content to be able to work on just that one project? With <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/samples" data-linktype="external">docs.microsoft.com/samples</a>, you can now download the relevant code without having to clone the entire repository. The <strong>Download ZIP</strong> functionality allows you to get the latest version of the specific sample from GitHub right away.</p><p><img src="media/code-samples/download-zip.jpg" alt="Button that shows how to download a ZIP for a sample" data-linktype="relative-path"></p><h2 id="navigate-directly-to-the-code">Navigate directly to the code</h2><p>There are many repositories out there, often with samples nested several levels deep. You no longer need to spend time figuring out where in the repository the code sample is located if you want to take a closer look at its implementation - just press <strong>Browse code</strong> and get to the location within the GitHub source instantly!</p><p><img src="media/code-samples/navigate-to-sample.gif" alt="Navigate directly to the code sample from the sample page" data-linktype="relative-path"></p><h2 id="instant-search-results-and-filtering">Instant search results and filtering</h2><p>When looking for the right sample, it's now possible to use both keyword search and in-page filters - all within one view, with results shown right as you make your selections.</p><p><img src="media/code-samples/filter.gif" alt="Filtering and searching code samples" data-linktype="relative-path"></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>We are excited to bring you a better code samples experience, and as we learn more from developers on what works best in their environments, we will be continuously improving <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/samples" data-linktype="external">docs.microsoft.com/samples</a>. We're also continuing to add more samples to our index, so if you find any official Microsoft code that is not yet discoverable, <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/feedback/issues/new?template=Custom.md" data-linktype="external">let us know</a>.</p><p>Stay tuned for future announcements!</p><h2 id="we-want-your-feedback">We want your feedback</h2><p>As we roll out the new samples browser, we want to hear from you on what we can improve! Reach out to us on <a href="https://twitter.com/docsmsft" data-linktype="external">Twitter</a> or the official <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/feedback" data-linktype="external">docs.microsoft.com feedback repo</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>
