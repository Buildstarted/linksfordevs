We survey methods that utilize Monte Carlo (MC) integration to simulate light transport in scenes
with participating media. The goal of this course is to complement a recent EUROGRAPHICS 2018
state-of-the-art report providing a broad overview of most techniques developed to date, including a
few methods from neutron transport, with a focus on concepts that are most relevant to CG
practitioners. The wide adoption of path-tracing algorithms in high-end realistic rendering has
stimulated many diverse research initiatives aimed at efficiently rendering scenes with participating
media. More computational power has enabled holistic approaches that tie volumetric effects and
surface scattering together and simplify authoring workflows. Methods that were previously
assumed to be incompatible have been unified to allow renderers to benefit from each method's
respective strengths. Generally, investigations have shifted away from specialized solutions, e.g.
for single- or multiple-scattering approximations or analytical methods, towards the more versatile
Monte Carlo algorithms that are currently enjoying a widespread success in many production
settings. The goal of this course is to provide the audience with a deep, up-to-date understanding of
key techniques for free-path sampling, transmittance estimation, and light-path construction in
participating media, including those that are presently utilized in production rendering systems. We
present a coherent overview of the fundamental building blocks and we contrast the various
advanced methods that build on them, providing attendees with guidance for implementing existing
solutions and developing new ones.... <a href="2018-novak-mcvolrendering-abstract.pdf">Extended abstract</a></p><hr noshade="noshade"><h3>Reference</h3><p>
