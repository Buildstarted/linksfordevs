<p>The organization<br>
<a href="https://github.com/SignalR">@SignalR</a><br>
could probably also use a new description to reflect the change</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, the <code>SignalR</code> GitHub organization hosts ASP.NET SignalR (the version that predates this one). We are doing some work to consider how to restructure things like this though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, I'm curious about what make you choose between ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We considered most of these:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>@dotnet/signalr</code> continues to indicate SignalR can only be used with .NET, which has the same problem as <code>@aspnet/signalr</code>. With the Azure SignalR Service REST APIs and Azure Functions bindings, it's now possible to write a SignalR app without a single line of C# (though C# is still a fantastic language to do so in!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@signalr/client</code> gives us a place to hang other things, and creates a new identity, but in general we've been leaning away from doing that and want to consolidate a bit around a few Microsoft identities (see <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft">https://github.com/Microsoft</a> for example)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@azure/signalr</code> would align it with a bunch of other Azure clients. However, this has the opposite problem of <code>@aspnet/signalr</code>. While we don't want people to think SignalR can only be used with .NET, we <strong>also</strong> don't want people to think it can only be used with Azure! It can be used in either environment and works great in each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@microsoft/signalr</code> makes it clear it's the official SignalR client, produced by Microsoft. Other SignalR components can still be named things like <code>@microsoft/signalr-...</code> (like the MessagePack protocol library). It doesn't create brand new NPM orgs (there is already an <code>@microsoft</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end <code>@microsoft/signalr</code> was the clearest choice. Since it is somewhat disruptive to rename package names, we don't really expect to do it again, getting to something that is truly general (<code>@microsoft</code>) means we'll be happiest to live with it for a long time and avoid disrupting the ecosystem any more.</p>
