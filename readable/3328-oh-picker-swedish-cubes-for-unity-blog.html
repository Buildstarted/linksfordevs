It is a finished project in that I did what I wanted to do and don't plan to do any more.
</p><p>It's called OH Picker and it is an experimental program for applying affine transformations to colors in L*a*b* (aka CIELAB) space using a scene graph. I made it as a personal exercise in working with both L*a*b* and the Dear ImGui library.
</p><p>OH Picker takes advantage of the fact that, because L*a*b* has perceptual uniformity, it can be treated as a Euclidean space. Colors are treated as points and affine transformations (applied via a scene graph akin to many game engines') correspond to color alterations. Translation becomes tinting, scaling becomes saturation, and reflection becomes -- among other things -- hue shifting.
</p><p>You can learn learn more about it (and the color space it employs) through this video. Those who are familiar with L*a*b* can skip to 9:14, and those who want to open the program up and start playing around with it needn't watch past 15:48.
