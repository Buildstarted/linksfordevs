                            <h3>        The implementation of the commitment scheme in the SwissPost-Scytl mixnet uses a trapdoor commitment scheme, which allows anyone who knows

                                This allows undetectable vote manipulation by anyone who implemented, administered, or otherwise took control of
                                a mix server.</h3>

                                Verifiability, trust, and why this matters
                            </h2>
                        <section>
                            <p>Verifiability is a critical part of the trustworthiness of e-voting
                            systems. Universal verifiability means that a proof of proper election
                            conduct should be verifiable by any member of the public.

                            </p><p>The <a href="https://www.post.ch/en/business/a-z-of-subjects/industry-solutions/swiss-post-e-voting">SwissPost e-voting system,</a> provided by Scytl, aims to offer a partial form of verifiability,
                            called ``complete verifiability'', which resembles universal verifiability
                            but adds the assumption that
                            at least one of the components on the server-side, i.e., the computers
                            running the voting system, behaves
                            correctly.  (Universal
                            verifiability offers guarantees
                            even if all server-side components are malicious.)</p>

                            <p>In the SwissPost system, encrypted electronic votes need to be
                            shuffled to protect individual vote privacy.
                            Each server who shuffles votes
                            is supposed to prove
                            that the set of input votes it received corresponds exactly to the
                            differently-encrypted votes it output.
                            This is intended to provide an electronic equivalent of the publicly
                            observable use of a ballot box or glass urn.
                            </p>

                            <p>We show that the mixnet specification and code
                            recently made available for analysis
                            does not meet the assumptions of a sound shuffle proof and hence does
                            not provide universal or complete verifiability.</p>

                            <p>We give two examples of how an authority who implemented or administered
                                a mix server could produce a perfectly-verifying transcript while
                            actually - undetectably - manipulating votes.</p>

                        </section>
                            <section>
                                <h2>
                                    Details
                                </h2>

                                <p>The problem derives from the use of a trapdoor commitment scheme in
                                    the shuffle proof.  If a malicious authority knows the trapdoors for
                                    the cryptographic commitments, it can provide an apparently-valid
                                    proof, which passes verification, while actually having manipulated
                                    votes. There is no modification of the audit process that would make
                                    it possible to detect if a manipulation happened. Instead, the key
                                    generation process for the commitment scheme needs to be modified in
                                    such a way that it offers evidence that no trapdoor has been
                                    produced, and the audit process should include the verification of
                                    this new evidence.</p>

                                <p>The first cheating example requires knowing the randomness used to generate the vote ciphertexts that will be manipulated.  There are several ways this could be achieved.  For example, an attacker could compromise the clients used for voting.  Weak randomness generation (such as that which affected the Norwegian Internet voting system) would allow the attack to be performed without explicit collusion.</p>

                                 <p>   The second cheating example does not require any extra information at
                                    all, though it does rely on the election parameters having been set up in a particular way, and on multiple selections being accepted as valid votes.</p>

                                We have not thoroughly tested or examined all other aspects of the system.
                                Even if this issue is corrected, there may be other unnoticed problems.

                                <p> Each pair of transcripts illustrates an example of how the commitment trapdoor could be used to
                                    produce an apparently-valid proof when actually manipulating votes.  In each case, we have
                                    provided both a normal transcript with realistic encrypted votes, and a transcript
                                    with all randomness set to zero.  The latter is not a normal run of the mix, but you can
                                    see immediately that the votes change.  </p>
                                <p> You will need a running copy of the SwissPost-Scytl code in order to verify the cheating proofs.  See the README
                                    for instructions.

                            <p>Nothing in our analysis suggests that this problem was introduced deliberately.  It is entirely consistent
                            with a naive implementation of a complex cryptographic protocol by well-intentioned people who lacked a full
                            understanding of its security assumptions and other important details.  Of course, if someone did want to
                            introduce an opportunity for manipulation, the best method would be one that could be explained away as an
                            accident if it was found.  We simply do not see any evidence either way.</p>
