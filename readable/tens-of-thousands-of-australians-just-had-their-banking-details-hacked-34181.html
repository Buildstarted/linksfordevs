It's a system used by all of the big four banks, with customers from each believed to have been affected.</p><p>When a registered mobile number is typed into the app, it also displays the owner of the account's name.</p><p><strong>More on 7NEWS.com.au</strong></p><ul><li><a data-link-type="article-inline" target="_blank" href="https://7news.com.au/business/banking/westpac-bank-to-refund-home-loan-customers-after-processing-error-c-205524"><strong>Westpac bank to refund home loan customers after processing error</strong></a></li><li><a data-link-type="article-inline" target="_blank" href="https://7news.com.au/business/banking/westpac-cyber-attack-bank-under-fire-after-thousands-of-customers-details-exposed-c-147291"><strong> Westpac cyber attack: Bank under fire after thousands of customers' details exposed </strong></a></li><li><a data-link-type="article-inline" target="_blank" href="https://7news.com.au/news/commonwealth-bank-atms-reportedly-failing-across-the-country-c-210142"><strong>Commonwealth Bank ATM, EFTPOS machine outage across the country</strong></a></li></ul><p>It's believed fraudulent accounts worked to generate a series of random numbers.</p><p>The millions of randomly-generated numbers would eventually coincide with real phone numbers registered in the app and reveal customers' names and details.</p><p>The most recent breach follows a strikingly similar attack on Westpac from early June.</p><p>In that instance, about 98,000 customers' information was shared with seven fraudulent accounts.</p><p>At the time, a Westpac spokesperson told 7NEWS.com.au: "Westpac Group takes the protection of customer data and privacy extremely seriously and we continually monitor our systems."</p><p>It was believed that, since all of the big four banks offer PayID, other banks' customers could be vulnerable.</p><h2>Westpac respond</h2><p>The spokesperson now says it was notified of the breach when a customer of another bank was affected.</p><p>It's understood the bank which raised the alarm was not one of the big four.</p><p>"Westpac was made aware of an incident at another financial institution which has resulted in the disclosure of PayID account data of a number of individuals.</p><p>"This incident has affected customers from other banks including Westpac and we have notified all impacted Westpac customers."</p><h2>Scam warning</h2><p>Customers are encouraged to remain vigilant for any emails or texts that look dodgy.</p><p>"We are urging all customers to be wary of any SMS phishing attempts – for example, a personalised message which looks like a legitimate message from Westpac or another bank, in an attempt to acquire banking credentials and password."</p><p>No customers from Bank of Melbourne, BankSA and St. George were impacted.</p><h2>New Platform Payments</h2><p>In a statement, the New Payments Platform said it was aware of a "vulnerability" of data.</p><p>"The affected data included PayID name and account numbers," the statement read.</p><p>"None of the details involved can, on their own, enable the withdrawal of funds from a customer’s account without the customer’s specific further involvement."</p></div></div></div></div></div>
