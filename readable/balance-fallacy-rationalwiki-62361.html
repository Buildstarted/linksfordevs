<p>The <b>balance fallacy</b> is an <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy" title="Informal fallacy">informal logical fallacy</a> that occurs when two sides of an <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument" title="Argument">argument</a> are assumed to have equal or comparable value regardless of their respective merits, which (in turn) can lead to the conclusion that the answer to a problem is always to be found between two <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Extremism" title="Extremism">extremes</a>. The latter is effectively an inverse <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/False_dilemma" title="False dilemma">false dilemma</a>, discarding the two extremes rather than the middle.
</p><p>While the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rational" title="Rational">rational</a> position on a topic is often between two extremes, this cannot be assumed without actually considering the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence" title="Evidence">evidence</a>. Sometimes the extreme position is actually the correct one, and sometimes the entire spectrum of belief is wrong, and <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Truth" title="Truth">truth</a> exists in an orthogonal direction that hasn't yet been considered.
</p><p>Balance is often a problem in the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Media" title="Media">media</a>, where confrontational or adversarial <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Journalism" title="Journalism">journalism</a> might present more of a controversy about some topic than actually exists, giving equal time to <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fringe" title="Fringe">fringe</a> minority viewpoints to draw in viewers. It is effectively the opposite of <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Bias" title="Bias">bias</a> — whereas bias over-emphasises one view to the detriment of another legitimate, well-supported view to give the impression of one being favoured, false balance over-emphasises a minority or unsupported view to the detriment of a well-supported view to give the impression that neither is favoured.

<p>There is a choice to make between doing <i><b>X</b></i> or doing <i><b>Y</b></i>. Therefore, the answer is somewhere between <i><b>X</b></i> and <i><b>Y</b></i>.
</p><p>The problem is that it's possible that either <i><b>X</b></i> or <i><b>Y</b></i> is entirely true, meaning that only partially doing the right thing makes little sense. This argument is generally built around the idea that the middle point between two extremes is equal parts of each side and therefore equally acceptable to both sides; but as the saying goes, half a kitten is not half as cute, it's a bloody mess.

<p>The application of the fallacy leads to major problems:
</p>
<ul><li>It can lead to equal exposure of an argument <i>despite</i> its lack of merit or relevance. This may arise due to a misunderstanding of <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Probability" title="Probability">probability</a>, that two outcomes or positions lead to a probability of 50:50 for each, and so both deserve an equal chance to put themselves forward. In fact, probability is not necessarily equal.</li></ul>
<ul><li>It can lead to the belief that the truth must lie somewhere in-between the two opposing sides, when it's very much possible that one side is completely wrong. In this context the fallacy is sometimes known as the <b><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Appeal_to_moderation" title="Appeal to moderation">argument to moderation</a></b> or (<i>argumentum ad temperantiam</i>), and may be the result of attempts to reach a compromise between mutually exclusive positions, as often found in <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Political" title="Political">political</a> <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Debate" title="Debate">debate</a> where there is not necessarily an <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Objective_morality" title="Objective morality">objective</a> "truth", as such, to be found behind a political policy.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The currency of experts is over-inflated, and one could argue that the bubble has popped. When CNN is presenting <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Professor_of_nothing" title="Professor of nothing">Doctor Joe Bloggs</a> as a climate change "expert" against someone with a Princeton degree who has dedicated their life to the topic, the public now needs an expert to examine credentials before they can examine evidence given by experts. Conversely, the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> instructed their reporters to stop giving credence to climate deniers in 2014.</li></ul>

<p>Avoiding the balance fallacy requires objective criteria for assessing arguments and cannot rely on just giving all arguments equal exposure for the sake of fairness. Arguments must be assessed using criteria such as <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Formal_logic" title="Formal logic">formal logic</a>, scholarly consensus and <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Empirical" title="Empirical">empirical</a> <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence" title="Evidence">evidence</a> to see if a legitimate controversy exists between two viewpoints. Avoiding the balance fallacy does not entitle someone to the freedom to reject any and all criticism because they claim to have sufficiently "proven" their position, however. The fallacy is also avoided in generalised criticisms of "both sides", as long as the speaker does not try to imply that there is equality within the criticised concept. For example, saying "both feminists and anti-feminists alike make bad arguments" is not an example of the balance fallacy, though suggesting that they use equally bad logic overall probably is. Here, the criticised concept is "making bad arguments". 
</p><p><b>Moral equivalence</b> is a related concept, which refers to the degree of comparability of different actions or beliefs on a moral basis. Basically, how morally justifiable is a certain viewpoint? For example, right-wingers often point out that both <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Communists" title="Communists">communists</a> and <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fascists" title="Fascists">fascists</a> killed people, yet, fascism is seen as more negative. Furthermore, while Nazi symbols are often subject to significant controversy and legal restrictions<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>, while, comparatively, communist symbols are not.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> However, many on the left would be quick to point out the lack of a moral equivalence between these ideologies; the flaws of fascism and Nazism lie not only in the method - an extremely authoritarian, jingoistic government - but also in the underlying ideals, which include <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Racism" title="Racism">racial purity</a> and genocide. Communism, while implemented poorly, does not necessitate these exclusionary and fringe aspects in order to coherently function as a theory, so it is allowed to be promoted, even if considered extremist. Here, there is a false moral equivalence between fascism and communism. This concept was also brought up during the 2017 Charlottesville protests, where <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Trump" title="Trump">Trump</a> condemned violence on "many sides"<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>. Technically, he is correct to do so, though this is arguably a false equivalence because anti-fascist violence is justified when defending against actual fascists.
That being said, moral equivalence may not always be relevant. For example, if one has a low opinion of both Antifa and fascists (for different reasons), it is not a balance fallacy to criticise them both. Arguing the contrary risks invoking <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Not_as_bad_as" title="Not as bad as">relative privation</a>, a fallacy in which because "we're not as bad as them, there's no problem". The fact that fascists generally suck doesn't excuse *all* of the actions of Antifa, and invoking 'moral equivalence' here is a mere distraction.
</p><p><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> avoids the balance fallacy (to some degree) with its policy of not giving undue weight<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> to minority viewpoints or <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fringe" title="Fringe">fringe</a> theories<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> in its articles. <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/RationalWiki" title="RationalWiki">RationalWiki</a>, on the other hand, avoids the balance fallacy by calling fringe theories <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Bullshit" title="Bullshit">bullshit</a> from start to finish even though some of the theories of the greatest scientists of all time were considered "fringe" theories in their time.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[note 1]</a></sup>

<p>In general, politics is a process of compromise between interest groups making extreme demands; for example, the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gun_control" title="Gun control">gun control</a> debate does have people on one side who want to ban kitchen knives and people on the other who think it should be lawful for civilians to own <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear weapons</a>. Indeed, in politics the term "extremist" has a connotation of unreasonableness attached to it. However, it is still true that extremists are not wrong simply because they are extreme; in <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Hitler" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> wanted to kill all the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jews" title="Jews">Jews</a>, while the Jews didn't want him to kill any of them. Most would <i>not</i> argue the logically correct answer was to kill half the Jews.
</p><p>It may sound <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Hyperbole" title="Hyperbole">hyperbolic</a>, but remember that the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Alt-right" title="Alt-right">alt-right</a> has become a legitimate political movement. <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" title="Donald Trump">Donald Trump</a> has created <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Concentration_camp" title="Concentration camp">concentration camps</a> for refugees, has accused <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">his predecessor</a> of being a foreign agent, and has refused to release his <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Tax" title="Tax">tax</a> returns (<a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney" title="Mitt Romney">Romney</a> tried this stunt and got battered for his evasion). The press is forced to entertain his point of view. America hasn't changed that much in four years, but the media landscape has. Cable networks like <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/CNN" title="CNN">CNN</a> are desperate. Their biggest share of viewers are older and whiter than the general public, and that skews <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Republican" title="Republican">Republican</a>.

<p>While evolution bears the brunt of the balance fallacy, issues of <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine" title="Evidence-based medicine">evidence-based medicine</a> suffer from news reports wanting to put forward balanced views.

</p><p>The main issue with health scares is that while balance is sought in terms of content and exposure, it's rarely ever achieved in terms of what the public perceive, not least because if balance <i>was</i> properly achieved, the audience wouldn't go away thinking that there was a controversy. In debates regarding health, the evidence side will usually be represented by a doctor who states facts, figures and research, while the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Paranoid" title="Paranoid">paranoid</a> side will be represented by some "human interest" (<a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jenny_McCarthy" title="Jenny McCarthy">Jenny McCarthy</a> for example). While the "human interest" side would cite no <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fact" title="Fact">facts</a> or figures, their <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Emotional_appeal" title="Emotional appeal">emotive stories</a> resonate far more with the public who can empathise with an individual more than they can do with a <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Clinical_trial" title="Clinical trial">clinical trial</a>. Therefore the message received by the audience is more "individuals are concerned and are suffering, why aren't scientists taking note of them" rather than the more accurate "the plural of <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Anecdote" title="Anecdote">anecdote</a> is not data."

<p>Simply drawing attention to some perceived flaw of a position or group can be seen as a wholesale attack on the <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Stereotype" title="Stereotype">entire position or group</a>. Thus, people often engage in the balance fallacy not out of any true belief that both flaws that they are mentioning are equal, but rather out of desire to avoid <i><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Tu_quoque" title="Tu quoque">tu quoque</a></i> attacks. This then often backfires and results in accusations of being a <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Concern_troll" title="Concern troll">concern troll</a>.

<p>In political <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Journalism" title="Journalism">journalism</a>, a similar phenomenon often referred to as "<b>Broderism</b>," after the late David Broder, former senior editor at the <i><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Washington_Post" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i>.  It is often said that there is no single scandal, no matter how overwhelmingly <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Partisan" title="Partisan">partisan</a>, that he couldn't find some instance of the other party doing something maybe, kind of, almost close to being in the ballpark of the same thing, so that every thing wrong in <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Washington,_DC" title="Washington, DC">Washington</a> is the fault of both parties.  An example of Broderism would be that, while many <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Republican" title="Republican">Republican</a> elected officials have embraced <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Birtherism" title="Birtherism">Birtherism</a> wholeheartedly, these one or two <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Democratic_Party" title="Democratic Party">Democratic</a> supporters are <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/9/11_truthers" title="9/11 truthers">9/11 truthers</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[note 5]</a></sup> so each party is equally crazy.
</p><p>On <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fark" title="Fark">Fark</a>, similar arguments are referred to as "BSABSVR," short for "Both Sides Are Bad, So Vote Republican."
</p><p>There is an old joke in journalism: "As Mr. <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Hitler" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> would say…" The joke is that you can't do even a story about how horrible the Holocaust is without including Hitler's viewpoint, in the name of balance.

As critics of historical-Jesus (HJ) research have pointed out, most "experts" who insist on a HJ are <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> researchers who are primarily <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Theology" title="Theology">theologists</a> and literature experts with some historical training. The "experts" are overwhelmingly <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Christian" title="Christian">Christian</a> or formerly Christian, while secular professional historians whose research focuses on ancient history tend to be less insistent. Moreover, the multitude of often mutually-radically contradictory conceptions about the HJ is highly unusual for people whose historical existence is secure and does not inspire confidence in the field, as does the employment of authenticity criteria unique to biblical studies. In contrast, <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Socrates" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> researchers admit to the serious difficulties with attempts to reconstruct details about the historical Socrates and his teachings much more readily, even though the evidence for him is much better, which is why his historical existence is not controversial. While Jesus mythicism admittedly attracts lots of crackpots and shoddy arguments, there are quite sane, competent and methodically rigorous HJ <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Sceptic" title="Sceptic">sceptics</a> and even outright advocates of mythicism, such as Doherty and Carrier, who tend to be quite annoyed by low-quality mythicism. Many <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Secular" title="Secular">secular</a> sceptics feel that it is the HJ research, that, even though respected in the mainstream, is almost equally bullshit as some of the more outlandish variations on the Jesus myth theory.</span>
