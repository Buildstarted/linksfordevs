    <h1>Hiring for .NET Teams in Prague, Czech Republic</h1>
    <div class="wrapper"> <p>As of 2019/6/5 we are hiring 2 full .NET teams in Prague, Czech Repubic:</p>
<ol> <li><strong>.NET Engineering Services team</strong> - see <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/i/us/en/job/632975/Software-Engineer-Core-Development-Tools">full job description</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/ziki_cz/status/1136498403418955776">tweet &#x201C;teaser&#x201D;</a> </li> <li><strong>Base Class Libraries / Networking team</strong> - see <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/i/us/en/job/633945/Software-Engineer-NET-Core-Platform">full job description</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/ziki_cz/status/1136498644725698561">tweet &#x201C;teaser&#x201D;</a> <ul> <li>Primary contact: <a href="https://twitter.com/ziki_cz">@ziki_cz</a> (Twitter DM is prefered, see my profile for other contact info like email) - expect answer in &lt;24h, if not, feel free to ping me again (to avoid accidentally missed DMs/emails)</li> <li>Positions: Software Engineer</li> <li>Start discussion with answers to these 2 questions - to see if it makes sense to send over resume or apply to the job post (expect cross time-zone delays in replies): <ol> <li>What is your related library-level, system-level or networking-related experience from work or hobby projects?</li> <li>Describe some interesting technical challenge (ideally related to the job). An investigation, bug fix or feature, etc. Something you are proud of.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Details: <ul> <li>Library-level = producing libraries used by multiple projects, ideally by multiple companies.</li> <li>System-level = anything low-level, close to OS APIs, drivers, HW interaction, or some non-trivial backend (e.g. difficult multi-threading, scale).</li> <li>Networking = libraries / APIs / protocols operating on network to communicate between computers. Server-side, or client-sie, or both.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>
</ol> <p><strong>Basic infornation:</strong></p>
<ul> <li>Location: Prague, Czech Republic</li> <li>Remote: No (we expect 60% presence in Microsoft Prague office)</li> <li>Relocation: Yes</li> <li>Visa sponsorship: Yes</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> We expect to get through first wave of candidates in a few weeks.
Interviews will be likely held in Prague between end of July, and September (details are TBD and subject to change).</p> <h3 id="international-teams-working-across-time-zones">International teams working across time-zones</h3> <p>Note that the teams are part of larger international teams working across time-zones (esp. in US West-coast time-zone - PT, which is 9 hours behind CET time-zone in Europe, so 9am PT is 18 CET).
Expect, that the job will require also occasional availability in US West-coast business hours.</p> <p>It does not mean you have to work more or longer hours!
Your work hours will be flexible, but the job will require you at times to attend some meetings, or communicate with some colleagues at hours outside of &#x201C;classic&#x201D; European business hours.
While it is manageable, it is something to consider as it may impact your established schedule and it may require some flexibility from your side.</p> <p>If you have questions, or concerns, please bring it up in your discussion with primary contact above.</p> <p>Note that our larger teams already have a few individual remote workers working from Europe, incl. Prague.
Our US-based team members are used to working with remote workers in Europe and to accomodate to their availability limitations.
We can share some of their experiences with you if it helps you to make a decision.</p> <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2> <h3 id="what-if-i-am-interested">What if I am interested?</h3> <p>We recommend to reach out to the primary contact listed above to:</p>
<ul> <li><strong>Discuss your experience and fit for the role.</strong></li> <li>Learn more about the position, team dynamics, the location, team culture, etc.</li>
</ul> <h3 id="can-i-apply-directly-to-the-job-posting">Can I apply directly to the job posting?</h3> <p>Yes, you can.
However, starting the discussion with primary contact will help you learn more upfront and it will give us information about your fit for the role.
It is also more interactive (while asynchronous) communication channel.
Typically it gives candidates higher chance to highlight relevant things than just submitting their resume.</p> <h3 id="should-i-send-you-my-resume">Should I send you my resume?</h3> <p>For <strong>Base Class Libraries / Networking team</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/ziki_cz">@ziki_cz</a>), please start with answering the 2 questions above before you send over your resume.</p> <p>For <strong>.NET Engineering Services team</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/ElaMoscicka">@ElaMoscicka</a>), please start chat with her via email <a href="mailto:elmoscic@microsoft.com">elmoscic@microsoft.com</a> (please do NOT send your resume/CV via email due to GDPR).</p> <h3 id="what-should-i-highlight-in-my-resume">What should I highlight in my resume?</h3> <p>Make sure you include things which are relevant.</p> <p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> Great way to highlight your relevant experiences in resume/CV, is to start with first page as &#x201C;cover letter&#x201D;.
Describe most relevant things and why do you think you are a good fit for the job position.</p> <h3 id="what-should-i-expect-from-interview">What should I expect from interview?</h3> <p>Check official description from Microsoft recruiters: <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/life/how-to-ace-a-technical-interview-at-microsoft">How to ace a technical interview at Microsoft</a></p> <p>You can also view my personal suggestions and resources I collected lately to help others grow and succeed in interviewing for Microsoft: <a href="/interview_prep">Preparing for Interview at Microsoft</a>
