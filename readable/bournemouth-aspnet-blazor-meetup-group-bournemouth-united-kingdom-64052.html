We are aware that many use this platform to meet in person and meet socially but we have created it for busy people who already have many responsibilities with secular activities and families but would still like to benefit from learning new technology or just curious as to what Blazor is all about. From the feedback we have received from some well-known guest speakers, they really appreciate being able to deliver talks online which saves on, quite often long journeys to travel down, and it also enables us to reach out to really capable people anywhere in the world, which we think is awesome!</p><p>Look forward to seeing you next time!</p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div id="eventCard-270925515"><p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Bournemouth-ASP-NET-Blazor-Meetup-Group/events/270925515/"><span>Building a Blazor WASM &amp; Tailwind CSS search engine with Jon Hilton</span></a></p><div><div><div><div><div><p><time datetime="1595354400000"><span><span>Tue, Jul 21</span>, <span><span>7:00 PM GMT+1</span></span></span></time></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>We'll open the Zoom meeting at 6:45 pm and aim to start the presentation at 7:00 pm sharp.

Jon Hilton:
Jon spends his day's building applications using Microsoft technologies (plus, whisper it quietly, a little bit of JavaScript) and his spare time helping developers level up their skills and knowledge via his blog, courses, and books. He's especially passionate about enabling developers to build better web applications by mastering the tools available to them.

Talk 1:
Get Up and running with Blazor!

Talk 2:
Building a Blazor search engine!

- More Details
We are delighted to have Jon Hilton who will be conducting 2 Blazor presentations for us, the first aimed as an introduction to Blazor components and how to make use of them followed by a deeper dive into building a Blazor search engine with the UI being composed using Tailwind CSS.

Format of the evening:

[Presentation 1]
- Get Up and running with Blazor
An initial demo showcasing some of the key aspects of Blazor's component model, and how you can use them...

[Brief Intermission]

[Presentation 2]
- Building a Blazor search engine
Then dive into building a Marvel search engine, using Tailwind CSS.
Demonstrating the process of iterating from simple requirements to something a bit more fully-functional, which also looks decent.
