Like most collaborations, there were times when the two disagreed. Unlike most collaborations, their disagreements sometimes made it onto the printed page.&nbsp;</p><p>

The purpose of this blog is to document and analyze these instances of Lee-Kirby Dissonance.

<br></p><p><b>How Did This Happen?</b></p><p>Tight deadlines meant there wasn’t always time for Lee to get an art correction when it didn’t match his sensibilities, so he’d try to change it with text.&nbsp;</p><p>In later years, the two sometimes just willfully ignored each other’s ideas, which they were able to do because they collaborated using the Marvel Method.</p><p><b>What’s The Marvel Method?</b></p><p>Originally a writer would write a script and the artist would draw it. Since Jack Kirby and Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko were accomplished storytellers rather than just illustrators, Stan Lee devised a way to hand off some of the story creation to them so that he could write more books.</p><p>In the Marvel Method (also called working “Marvel Style”), the writer gives the artist a basic plot summary, and the artist fleshes it out into a story. Once the pages are drawn, the writer then adds dialogue to each panel.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s important to note that the writer was not always the one coming up with the initial plot. Lee &amp; Kirby would often discuss the plot together before Kirby went off to draw it. Steve Ditko eventually went one step further, delivering finished art without any discussion with Lee.</p><p>

He wrote the final dialogue in the panels themselves for the letterer to letter over, which leaves a mystery as to why he was writing those notes in the margins to himself. The prevailing theory is that he jotted them down hastily during the same meeting that Kirby was verbally explaining the story to him.</p><p>However, it seems just verbally explaining wasn’t working, so Kirby started writing things down. These early notes were pretty concise, but they gradually became more and more detailed as years went on, possibly in an attempt to safeguard the story from being misunderstood by Lee. However, it didn’t keep Lee from just ignoring and/or changing the intent of a story.&nbsp;</p><p>Kirby wasn’t the first to write story notes to Stan in the margins. <i>Daredevil</i> #1, published three months earlier, contains margin notes that are likely from artist Bill Everett. Steve Ditko may’ve been writing notes even earlier, though to the best of my knowledge he wrote on a separate sheet of paper and never in the margins, so we may never know for sure.</p><p><b>Avengers #6 (Page 20)</b></p><p>The earliest known issue to contain Kirby margin notes is <i>Avengers</i> #6. In the example at top, Kirby has written&nbsp;“Gonna finish off Black Knight,” the character Thor was fighting on the previous page. Since the note is written from Thor’s perspective, it’s possible he wanted Stan to write something dramatic for Thor to say while charging at the villain.</p><p>On the right I’ve adjusted the levels so you can read the note more easily. Also notice how you can see that Kirby originally drew Thor’s right leg going straight behind him.</p><p><b>Fantastic Four #28 (Page 2)</b></p><p>Above this panel, Kirby helpfully reminds forgetful Stan Lee that “Torch knows Iceman,” who met in an issue of <i>Strange Tales</i> also drawn by Kirby.</p><p>On the right there’s a note pointing to the newspaper, but it was chopped off when the art boards were trimmed. I can only assume it’s a note about what the headline should say, and it appears to be in Lee’s handwriting rather than Kirby’s.</p>

                                                    <p><b>Fantastic Four #18 (Pages 20 &amp; 21)</b></p><p>This is a very strange sequence for multiple reasons.</p><p>It starts out with Stan Lee having Sue give credit to all the guys for her being able to sneak up behind and tackle the Super-Skrull. Jack Kirby has her leading the Super-Skrull into a crater as part of a plan to seal him in, but then Stan Lee does something uncharacteristic:</p><p>Kirby has drawn the Super-Skrull leaping at Sue, and Reed pulling her out at the last minute, while Lee has added a caption to say that Sue actually tripped him! Strangely, Lee has her say&nbsp;“Reed!! Oh, thank heavens!,” which would’ve made sense in the context of Kirby’s version, but makes much less sense if she tripped him. Lee has actually created caption-dialogue dissonance with <i>himself</i>.</p><p>But that’s not all. In the next panel, Kirby has drawn Sue…well, I’m not sure how to describe it. Which is very uncharacteristic of Kirby, who normally draws body language that is very clear and expressive. For some reason she has her arms crossed in front of her and is leaning into Reed as if she’s cold, but that makes no sense. On top of that, her legs are spread in a very active pose that contradicts the language of her upper body. Could this have been a last minute redraw?</p><p>Very strange.</p>

After this, the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby each handled Sue Storm would begin to diverge.</p><p>In an 11-page story giving readers a glimpse into the lives of the Fantastic Four, two pages worth of story was devoted to lecturing readers who had negative comments about Sue Storm in fan letters they’d sent in.</p><p>Despite the way Stan Lee frames it here, very few readers actually wanted Sue off the team. According to poll results published in the letter column of the previous issue, 639 readers wanted her to stay, while only eight said they wanted her to go.</p><p>The problem was that every time a reader mentioned Sue Storm in a letter, they had the same criticism: we want to see her take a more active role. There was also some criticism of her ending up as a damsel in four of the first eight issues.</p><p>Stan Lee’s response is that Sue is like Abe Lincoln’s mom.</p><p>While it’s easy to rest all the blame on Lee, we don’t actually know for certain how different Kirby’s own opinions were at the time. The images do appear to match the words, including the Abe Lincoln bust (unless Lee had that added in by someone else).</p><p>However, Ben’s comment about&nbsp;“lady wrestlers” sounds very unlike Kirby’s views, at least based on what we’ll see in the issues that follow. It’s possible Kirby may have taken these letters to heart, as we see him begin to make Sue tougher. Maybe too tough for Lee, who will start using dialogue to undermine this shift.</p>
