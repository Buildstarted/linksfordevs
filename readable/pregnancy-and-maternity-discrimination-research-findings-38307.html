<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the Equality and Human Rights Commission commissioned a programme of research to investigate the prevalence and nature of pregnancy discrimination and disadvantage in the workplace. The Equality Act 2010 legislation prohibits pregnancy and maternity discrimination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The results in this report are based on interviews with <strong>3,034 employers and 3,254 mothers</strong>.</p>

<p>The two surveys cover the views and experiences of employers and mothers on a range of issues related to managing pregnancy, maternity leave and mothers returning to work. The report explored:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The type and incidence of potential pregnancy and maternity-related discrimination.</li>
	<li>The characteristics of women who experience possible discrimination.</li>
	<li>Availability and effectiveness of advice and support.</li>
	<li>Experiences of women who raise complaints or attempt to enforce their legal rights.</li>
	<li>Employer awareness of and attitudes to their legal rights and responsibilities.</li>
	<li>Employer attitudes towards recruiting and managing women of childbearing age, pregnant women, those on maternity leave and women with children.</li>
	<li>Availability of advice and support for employers (particularly small and medium-sized enterprises).</li>
	<li>Why some employers may possibly discriminate and others are successful in promoting good practice.</li>
	<li>The demand among mothers to breastfeed or express milk in the workplace and employer attitudes, policies and practices in relation to breastfeeding in the workplace.</li>
</ul></div></div></div></div></div>
