    <article itemprop="text"><p>Hey everyone - this is not just a one off thing, there are likely to be <em>many</em> other modules in your dependency trees that are now a burden to their authors. I didn't create this code for altruistic motivations, I created it <em>for fun</em>. I was learning, and learning is fun. I gave it away because it was easy to do so, and because sharing helps learning too. I think most of the small modules on npm were created for reasons like this. However, that was a long time ago. I've since <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/through" rel="nofollow">moved on from this module</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pull-stream" rel="nofollow">moved on from that thing too</a> and in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/push-stream" rel="nofollow">the process of moving on from that as well</a>. I've written way better modules than this, the internet just hasn't fully caught up.</p>

<p>If it's not fun anymore, you get literally nothing from maintaining a popular package.</p>
<p>One time, I was working as a dishwasher in a resturant, and I made the mistake of being too competent, and I got promoted to cook. This was only a 50 cents an hour pay rise, but massively more responsibility. It didn't really feel worth it. Writing a popular module like this is like that times a million, and the pay rise is zero.</p>
<p>I've shared publish rights with other people before. Of course, If I had realized they had a malicious intent I wouldn't have, but at the time it looked like someone who was actually trying to help me. Since the early days of node/npm, sharing commit access/publish rights, with other contributors was a widespread community practice. <a href="https://felixge.de/2013/03/11/the-pull-request-hack.html" rel="nofollow">https://felixge.de/2013/03/11/the-pull-request-hack.html</a> open source is driven by sharing! It's great! it worked really well before bitcoin got popular.</p>
<p>So right now, we are in a weird valley where you have a bunch of dependencies that are "maintained" by someone who's lost interest, or is even starting to burnout, <em>and that they no longer use themselves</em>.
You can easily share the code, but no one wants to share the responsibility for maintaining that code. Like a module is like a piece of digital property, a right that can be transferred, but you don't get any benefit owning it, like being able to sell or rent it, however you still retain the responsibility.</p>
<p>I see two strong solutions to this problem...</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay the maintainers!! Only depend on modules that you know are definitely maintained!</li>
<li>When you depend on something, you should take part in maintaining it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I prefer the second, but the first probably has it's place.
These arn't really mutually exclusive, anyway.</p>
<p>As to this particular issue, I have emailed npm support and suggested that they give the module to @FallingSnow and ar @XhmikosR</p>
