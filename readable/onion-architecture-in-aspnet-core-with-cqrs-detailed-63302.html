<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="bsf_rt_marker"><div><div><p>In this article, We will talk about Onion Architecture In ASP.NET Core and it’s advantages. We will also together build a WebApi that follows a variant of Onion Architecture so that we get to see why it is important to implement such an architecture in your upcoming projects. You can find the source code of this implementation on my <a href="https://github.com/iammukeshm/OnionArchitecture" target="_blank" aria-label="GitHub (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Disclaimer : This is a pretty huge article with around 3500+ words. Do bookmark this page and continue 😀 </strong></em></p></blockquote><h2><span id="The_Need_to_Follow_an_Architecture"></span>The Need to Follow an Architecture<span></span></h2><p>To maintain structural Sanity in Mid to Larger Solutions, it is always recommended to follow some kind of architecture. You must have seen most of the Open Sourced Projects having multiple layers of Projects within a complex folder structure.</p><h3><span id="Layer_Vs_Tiers"></span>Layer Vs Tiers<span></span></h3><p>When there is just a logical separation in your application, we can term it as layers or N Layers. In cases where there is both a physical and logical separation of concerns, it is often referred to as n-tiered application where n is the number of separations. 3 is the most common value of N. In this article, we will deal with the Layered Architecture.</p><p>This layering can help in the separation of concerns, subdividing the solution into smaller units so that each unit is responsible for a specific task and also to take advantage of abstraction. For mid to larger scaled projects where multiple teams work, layering has very obvious advantages up its sleeves. It lets a specific team or individual work on a particular layer without disturbing the integrity of the others. It makes it much easier to track changes using source control.</p><p>Also, <strong>It just makes your entire solution look clean.</strong></p><p>Before getting into Onion Architecture in ASP.NET Core, let’s first refresh our knowledge on N Layer Architecture.</p><h2><span id="Brief_Overview_of_NLayer_Architecture"></span>Brief Overview of N-Layer Architecture<span></span></h2><p>Let’s look at the one of the most popular Architecture in ASP.NET Core Applications. Here is a simple diagramatic representation of a variation of the N-Layer Architecture. Presentation Layer usualy holds the Part that the User can interact with, i.e, WebApi, MVC, Webforms and so on. Business Logic is probably the most important part of this entire setup. It holds all the logics related to the Business Requirement. Now, every application ideally has it’s own dedicated Database. Inorder to access the Database, we introduce a Data Access Layer. This layer usually holds ORMs for ASP.NET to fetch/write to the database.</p><div><figure><img alt="N-Tier Architecture Diagram" title="N-Tier Architecture Diagram" data-srcset="https://www.codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/N-Tier-Architecture.png 700w, https://www.codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/N-Tier-Architecture-480x480.png 480w" data-src="https://www.codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/N-Tier-Architecture.png" data-sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" src="https://www.codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/N-Tier-Architecture.png" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" srcset="https://www.codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/N-Tier-Architecture.png 700w, https://www.codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/N-Tier-Architecture-480x480.png 480w"></figure></div><h2><span id="Disadvantages_of_NLayer_Architecture"></span>Disadvantages of N-Layer Architecture<span></span></h2><p>To clearly understand the advantages of Onion Architecture in ASP.NET Core Applications, we will need to study the issues with N Layer Architecture. It is one of the commonly used Solution Architecture amongst .NET developers.</p><p>Instead of building a highly decoupled structure, we often end up with several layers that are depending on each other. This is something really bad in building scalable applications and may pose issues with the growth of the codebase. To keep it clear, in the above diagram we can see that the presentation layer depends on the logics layer, which in turn depends on the data access and so on.</p><p>Thus, we would be creating a bunch of unnecessary couplings. Is it really needed? In most of the cases the UI (presentation) layer would be coupled to the Data Access Layers as well. This would defeat the purpose of having a clean architecture, yeah?</p><p>In N Layer Architecture, the Database is usually the Core of the Entire Application, i.e It is the only layer that doesn’t have to depend on anything else. Any small change in the Business Logics layer or Data access layer may prove dangerous to the integrity of the entire application.</p><h2><span id="Getting_Started_with_Onion_Architecture"></span>Getting Started with Onion Architecture<span></span></h2><p>The Onion architecture, introduced by Jeffrey Palermo, overcomes the issues of the layered architecture with great ease. With Onion Architecture, the game-changer is that the Domain Layer (Entities and Validation Rules that are common to the business case ) is at the Core of the Entire Application. This means higher flexibility and lesser coupling. In this approach, we can see that all the Layers are dependent only on the Core Layers.</p><div><figure><img alt="Onion Architecture In ASP.NET Core Diagram" width="700" height="700" title="Onion Architecture In ASP.NET Core Diagram" data-srcset="https://www.codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Onion-Architecture-In-ASP.NET-Core.png 700w, https://www.codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Onion-Architecture-In-ASP.NET-Core-480x480.png 480w" data-src="https://www.codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Onion-Architecture-In-ASP.NET-Core.png" data-sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" src="https://www.codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Onion-Architecture-In-ASP.NET-Core.png" srcset="https://www.codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Onion-Architecture-In-ASP.NET-Core.png 700w, https://www.codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Onion-Architecture-In-ASP.NET-Core-480x480.png 480w"></figure></div><p><strong>Here is how I would breakdown the structure of the proposed Solution.</strong></p><p><strong>Domain and Application Layer</strong> will be at the center of the design. We can refer to these layers at the Core Layers. These layers will not depend on any other layers.</p><p>Domain Layer usually contains enterprise logic and entities. Application Layer would have Interfaces and types. The main difference is that The Domain Layer will have the types that are common to the entire enterprise, hence can be shared across other solutions as well. But the Application Layer has Application-specific types and interface. Understand?</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the Core Layers will never depend on any other layer. Therefore what we do is that we create interfaces in the Application Layer and these interfaces get implemented in the external layers. This is also known and DIP or Dependency Inversion Principle.</p><p>For example, If your application want’s to send a mail, We define an IMailService in the Application Layer and Implement it outside the Core Layers. Using DIP, it is easily possible to switch the implementations. This helps build scalable applications.</p><p><strong>Presentation Layer</strong> is where you would Ideally want to put the Project that the User can Access. This can be a WebApi, Mvc Project, etc.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure Layer</strong> is a bit more tricky. It is where you would want to add your Infrastructure. Infrastructure can be anything. Maybe an Entity Framework Core Layer for Accessing the DB, or a Layer specifically made to generate JWT Tokens for Authentication or even a Hangfire Layer. You will understand more when we start Implementing Onion Architecture in ASP.NET Core WebApi Project.</p><h2><span id="Implementing_Onion_Architecture_in_ASP_NET_Core_WebApi_Project"></span>Implementing Onion Architecture in ASP.NET Core WebApi Project<span></span></h2><p>To keep things simple but demonstrate the architecture to the fullest, we will build an ASP.NET Core Web API that is quite scalable. For this article, Let’s have a WebApi that has just one entity, Product. We will perform CRUD Operations on it while using the Onion architecture. This will give you quite a clear picture.</p><p>Here is a list of features and tech we will be using for this setup.</p><ul><li>Onion Architecture</li><li>Entity Framework Core</li><li>.NET Core 3.1 Library / .NET Standard 2.1 Library / ASP.NET Core 3.1 WebApi</li><li>Swagger</li><li>CQRS / Mediator Pattern using MediatR Library</li><li>Wrapper Class for Responses</li><li>CRUD Operations</li><li>Inverted Dependencies</li><li>API Versioning</li></ul><h3><span id="Setting_up_the_Solution_Structure"></span>Setting up the Solution Structure<span></span></h3><p>We will start off by creating a Blank Solution on Visual Studio.

Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore</pre><p>We have a Entity named Product. Now we need to establish this class as a Table using Entity Framework Core. So we will need a ApplicationDBContext. But the catch is that, we won’t create the actual concrete implementation of the ApplicationDbContext here in the Application Layer. Rather, we will just add a IApplicatoinDbContext Interface so that the EF Logics does not fall under the Application Layer, but goes to the Persistence layer which is outside the core,</p><p>This is how you can invert the dependencies to build scalable applications. Now , the advantage is that, tommorow, you need a different implementation of the ApplicationDbContext, you don’t need to touch the existing code base, but just add another Infrastructure layer for this purpose and implement the IApplicationDbContext. As simple as that.</p><p>Create a new folder Interfaces in the Application Project. Add a new interface in it, IApplicationDbContext</p><pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public interface IApplicationDbContext

Do you add all this 100 lines of code to the Startup.cs to register them in the container? That would be insane in the maintainability point of view. To keep things clean, what we can do is, Create a DependencyInjection static Class for every layer of the solution and only add the corresponding . required services to the corresponding Class.</p><p>In this way, we are decentralizing the code lines and keeping our Startup class neat and tidy.

Few of the solutions developed and maintained by Microsoft MVPs like <a href="https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb" target="_blank" aria-label="eShopOnWeb  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">eShopOnWeb </a>and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers" target="_blank" aria-label="eShopOnContainers  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">eShopOnContainers </a>also follow a similar (slightly more complicated variant of this approach).</p><p>I hope that this is quite understandable to all, especially the ones starting about with the entire Solution Architecturing Stuff. Let me know your feedback and the scopes of improvement in this approach.
