Itâ€™s convenient to retrieve the value of arguments or local variables of methods in the callstack. Recently, for an investigation, I ran across the need to dump those values for a few thousand threads. Obviously this is not something youâ€™d want to do by hand, so I checked what was possible to do with ClrMD.</p><p id="534b" data-selectable-paragraph="">ClrMD defines an <code>EnumerateStackObjects</code> method on the <code>ClrThread</code> object, which seems to do exactly whatâ€™s needed. To make sure, we can write this small program and compare the output with the !DumpStackObjects command:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="fa6b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Letâ€™s see whatâ€™s going on here. <code>EnumerateStackObjects</code> returns a list of <code>ClrRoot</code> instances. Those instances represent references. The <code>Address</code> field contains the address of the reference <strong>on the stack</strong>, whereas the <code>Object</code> field contains the address of the object the reference is pointing to (the value youâ€™re likely interested in). If we compare the output of our program with WinDbg, it seems indeed to match:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*7UMo-nN0P-gKsh2B9Ns5vQ.png?q=20" width="1468" height="358" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="1468" height="358" role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1468/1*7UMo-nN0P-gKsh2B9Ns5vQ.png"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">ClrMD on the left, WinDbg/SOS on the right</figcaption></figure><p id="c724" data-selectable-paragraph="">That isâ€¦ on Windows. For my investigation, I needed to do the same thing with a Linux coredump. ClrMD is compatible with Linux, so it shouldnâ€™t be a problem, or so I thought. But when I ran the same code on Linux, no stack objects were found.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*0C7EU0Mtb0lrUdrZ0NkBkQ.png?q=20" width="2212" height="462" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="2212" height="462" role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2212/1*0C7EU0Mtb0lrUdrZ0NkBkQ.png"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">LLDB/SOS on the left, ClrMD on the right</figcaption></figure><p id="b943" data-selectable-paragraph="">Digging into the <code>EnumerateStackObjects</code> implementation, it seems that it gets the address range of the stack by inspecting <code>ClrThread.StackBase</code> and <code>ClrThread.StackLimit</code>, then checks every value in that range to find references. In my case, <code>StackBase</code> and <code>StackLimit</code> both returned 0, so it makes sense that the algorithm would then fail to find anything. So how are <code>StackBase</code> and <code>StackLimit</code> implemented?</p><p id="4c00" data-selectable-paragraph="">In ClrMD, <code>StackBase</code> and <code>StackLimit</code> are read from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32_Thread_Information_Block" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thread environment block (TEB)</a>. The contents of the TEB are retrieved directly from the DAC using the <code>GetThreadData</code> method. If we look at <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/d2a8b55d4c944438df1599c9a78262bc48f07266/src/debug/daccess/request.cpp#L752" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the implementation of that function in the CoreCLR repository</a>, the problem becomes quite obvious:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="f474" data-selectable-paragraph=""><code>FEATURE_PAL</code> is defined on all other platforms than Windows. It means that when running .net core on Linux, the TEB information of the thread will be empty. It actually makes sense since TEB is a Windows concept, but then how is the SOS DumpStackObjects function working on Linux?</p><p id="61af" data-selectable-paragraph="">This time, the answer lies <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/blob/367aa5cd433e5e5a9e128aee5acb8196231ac769/src/SOS/Strike/strike.cpp#L616" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in the dotnet/diagnostics repository</a>. Here is a stripped down version with only the interesting bits:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="7238" data-selectable-paragraph="">The code starts by getting the current stack pointer from the registers by calling the <code>GetStackOffset</code> method, and assigns it to <code>StackTop</code>. Then, <strong>only on Windows</strong>, it reads the TEB to get the address of the beginning the stack. For other platforms, thereâ€™s a fallback code where <code>StackBottom</code> is initialized to <code>StackTop + 0xFFFF</code> if no value has been assigned. This hack puzzles me quite a bit. 0xFFFF (64KB) is much smaller than the default size of the stack, and at the same time I donâ€™t think it offers any guarantee that we wonâ€™t read memory outside of the stack (I searched for a while but couldnâ€™t find any evidence that a guard page is allocated above the stack).</p><p id="0dca" data-selectable-paragraph="">However surprising it may look, our goal is just to mimic the DumpStackObject output, so can we implement the same logic in ClrMD?</p><p id="d525" data-selectable-paragraph="">For that, we need a way to retrieve the value of the RSP register, to get the stack offset. This is done by calling the <code>GetThreadContext</code> method with the id of the thread. It takes as parameter a byte array (or an <code>IntPtr</code>), in which is serialized the contents of a structure representing the registers. That structure is <code>AMD64Context</code>, <code>ArmContext</code>, or <code>Arm64Context</code> depending on the target architecture. In our case, we only care about AMD64:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="7c43" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once we have this information, we can start browsing the stack and search for references (the code is shamelessly copied <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-samples/blob/master/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime/CLRMD/ClrStack/Program.cs#L81" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">from the ClrMD samples</a>):</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="bb49" data-selectable-paragraph="">We start by trying to dereference any value we find in the stack, then we call <code>ClrHeap.GetObjectType</code> to find if it points to a valid object. If so, we display the result to the console.</p><p id="4bed" data-selectable-paragraph="">I tried running this code and it worked fine for a few hundred threads, then it crashed with a segmentation fault. I managed to track it down to a call to <code>ClrHeap.GetObjectType</code> with a specific address. Itâ€™s likely that we found a pointer to a value outside of the managed heap, which is causing some unpredictable behavior. How is SOS coping with this? Looking back at <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/blob/master/src/SOS/Strike/util.cpp#L1988" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the implementation</a>, it looks like we forgot a sanity check:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2aa3" data-selectable-paragraph="">With ClrMD, we can achieve the same result by enumerating the GC segments and making sure our address is inside one of those:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="a08e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now we have everything we need to finish our implementation of DumpStackObjects for Linux:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="062c" data-selectable-paragraph="">And this time, we get the same output as the !DumpStackObjects command, as expected:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*daCqEHgl0E3cX9_fNc2JYw.png?q=20" width="2215" height="488" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="2215" height="488" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div></figure></div></div></section></div></div></div>
