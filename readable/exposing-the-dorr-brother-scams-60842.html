Welcome. If you have been directed to this site, it is most likely because you have worries about one or more of the many groups run by or associated with the Dorr Brothers (Aaron, Chris, Ben, and Matt).</p><p>

We are happy you are here and hope you will learn the truth and that you will help us spread the word about this scheming group of fraudsters that are having a splendid time collecting your well-intended donations for their personal use while using confrontational politicking to harm and disparage some of our best legislators and some of the most effective lobbying and pro-gun, pro-life advocating groups around.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HWDnP7TCxWk/Xpyd1SLJVDI/AAAAAAAAAQw/pYWc0WfBq9oz6UO2YRAAjTVVyaCmOGGwQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/11states24orgs.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="181" data-original-width="395" height="146" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HWDnP7TCxWk/Xpyd1SLJVDI/AAAAAAAAAQw/pYWc0WfBq9oz6UO2YRAAjTVVyaCmOGGwQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/11states24orgs.jpg" width="320"></a></p>
<br></div>
<div>












<p><span>4/19 Note - the number of groups they are creating grows daily as they add additional&nbsp;</span><span>"</span><span>&lt;state&gt; Against Excessive Quarantine</span><span>"</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>"Reopen&lt;state&gt;</span><span>"&nbsp;</span><span>Facebook pages and web pages. We are adding as they get reported to us. They have already been busted twice (so far) stealing existing facebook page names from existing groups -&nbsp;<i>Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Reopen Minnesota</i>.</span></p>

Ask yourself:</p></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>How on God's green earth can they passionately, effectively, be involved in 22 organizations in 11 states, across four markets (2nd Amendment, Pro-Life, Disaster Relief, and Trump Clubs) and create the positive outcomes your donation(s) demand?</li>
<li>If they are so passionate about Pro-Gun (or Pro-life) legislation in my state, why don't they even live in my state?&nbsp;</li>
<li>If their deep passion and expertise is in fighting for 2nd Amendment rights, why did they jump into the Pro-life movement? ... and then Disaster Relief... and now Trump 2020?</li>
<li>Why are there over 2700 people in just Iowa alone, "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/trueiowagunowners/" target="_blank">The Truth About Gun Owners and the Dorr Brothers Scam</a>," Facebook page interested in exposing the group?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Why did the Minnesota GOP launch a <a href="https://www.mnscammersexposed.com/" target="_blank">website</a> dedicated to warning Minnesotans of the Dorr Brother organizations there?</li>
<li>Why do they always attack the most ardent pro-life and pro-2nd Amendment legislators? </li>
<li>Why do they always attack the most effective pro-life and pro-2nd Amendment advocate groups?</li>
<li>Why are there <a href="https://www.dorrbrotherscams.com/p/comprehensive-list-of-dorr-brothers_5.html" target="_blank">common complaints across the different states and groups</a>? Nearly always attacking the best of our legislators, always using confrontational politic tactics to fundraise? Taking credit for passed legislation they had little or nothing to do with?</li>
<li>If the Dorr Brothers love the unborn, wouldn't they do better for the unborn by trying to help unseat pro-abortion Democrats in lieu of attacking the best pro-life legislators and threaten their incumbencies?</li>
<li>Why do the same names keeping popping up on different social media posts, regardless of the issue (2A or pro-life)? The same people with the same tiresome, combative, argumentitive, confrontational (cruel and dishonest mostly) accusations thrown out there in the defense of the Dorr Brothers?&nbsp;</li>
