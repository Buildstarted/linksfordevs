			<h2>A better ergonomic keyboard.</h2>
			
			<p>It's the product customers have been begging us to do for years —&nbsp;an ERGONOMIC keyboard that gives you all of the tactile feedback, greater comfort, faster typing speeds, and quiet operation of a Matias mechanical keyboard.</p>
			
			<p>We also think it has the best layout of all the ergonomic keyboards so far.</p>
            			
			<p></p><h2>The best switches.</h2>
			<p>To put it bluntly, most ergonomic keyboards “cheap out” on their keyswitches.  They use rubber, instead of metal. Compromising here can ruin an otherwise good  keyboard.</p>
			<p>We’ve used the BEST keyswitches for typing... <a href="http://matias.ca/switches/quiet">Matias Quiet&nbsp;Click mechanical switches</a>.</p>
			<p>Their ALPS-inspired design delivers generous amounts of tactile feedback, while providing enough resistance to support the weight of your hands —&nbsp;exactly what you need for fast, comfortable typing.</p>
			<p>Plus, unlike every other mechanical switch, they are quiet enough to use in office environments.  You don’t need to worry about disturbing your co-workers.<a name="lowforce"></a></p><h2><a name="lowforce"></a>Low Force option also available.</h2>
			<p>For those who need (or prefer) typing with a lighter touch, a <b><i>Low&nbsp;Force Edition</i></b> of the Ergo Pro is also available.</p>
			<p>It uses <a href="http://matias.ca/switches/linear">Matias Quiet&nbsp;Linear switches</a> for a smooth, low&nbsp;force feel.  These same switches are used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype">stenotype machines</a>, capable of typing speeds upwards of 225&nbsp;words per minute.</p>


			<h2>A better navigation cluster.</h2>
			<p>Navigation keys have always been a big problem for ergonomic keyboards.</p>
			
			<p>If you follow the standard, the keyboard is too wide.</p>
			
			<p>If you don’t follow the standard, there’s a long learning curve, and users are stuck having to suffer with an awkward, unfamiliar layout.</p>
			
			<div><p>We’ve designed a truly new and better navigation cluster —&nbsp;one that’s much closer to standard AND more ergonomic...</p><p>
			
			</p><p>
			We’ve arranged the navigation keys in their traditional pattern, but we laid them out <i>horizontally</i>, and then positioned them along the bottom row, more like a laptop keyboard.</p></div>
			
			<p>It works beautifully, and the adjustment time is virtually zero.  Try it once, and you’ll never want to go back.<a name="tilt"></a></p><h2><a name="tilt"></a>Narrower than most<br>
			&amp; more comfortable with a mouse.</h2>
			<p>Thanks to our unique navigation cluster, the Ergo&nbsp;Pro is not as wide as other ergonomic keyboards.  It’s not much wider than a laptop keyboard.</p>
			
			<p>This makes it much more comfortable to use with a mouse.  Since you’re not reaching as far for it, your elbow doesn’t need to flare out at an awkward angle.</p>
            			
			<p></p><h2>Leg supports for tilting &amp; tenting.</h2>
			<div><p>As you would expect, the Ergo&nbsp;Pro comes equipped with leg supports for 9° tenting and 4.5° negative tilt.  It can also be used&nbsp;flat.
			</p><p>
			</p><p>
			For even greater adjustability, you can mount the two sides of the keyboard onto a pair of small <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-709B-Table-Tripod-Black/dp/B0000YD2JC/">tabletop tripods</a> (any standard type).</p></div>
		    
		    
			<h2>Spacious palm supports.</h2>
			<p>The palm supports are big and comfortable.  Plus, they can be removed, if your desk already has palm supports built-in.</p>
            			
			<p></p><h2>Everything is in the box.</h2>
			<p>We’ve included everything you need in the box.  There’s nothing extra to buy.  You are all ready to go.</p>

			<p>BUT if you did want to add a spot of color, we have replacement palm supports available <a href="http://matias.ca/sku/palmsupports">in 4 gorgeous colors</a>.</p>
            			
			<p><a href="http://matias.ca/sku/palmsupports"><img src="http://matias.ca/ergopro/pc/resources/images/PS403_960x540.jpg" width="444" height="250" alt="Color Palm Supports"></a></p><h2>Dedicated keys for...&nbsp;&nbsp;Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste</h2>
			<p>We’ve added dedicated hotkeys for the 4 most important keyboard shortcuts —&nbsp;undo, cut, copy, and paste.  Best of all, no drivers are required.  Everything works, right out of the box.</p>
            
            
			<h2>3 extra USB 2.0 ports.</h2>
			<p>Some keyboards have 2 USB ports — most have none.  We’re giving you three!  You can plug in flash drives, digital cameras, your mouse, and more.</p>
		    
		    
			<h2>Laser etched keys.</h2>
			<p>All those symbols are handy, but what happens when they wear off?   They won’t. They’re laser etched — burned into the keys with a laser — so they’ll never wear off.</p>
            
            
			<h2>Sculpted keytops.</h2>
			<p><img src="http://matias.ca/ergopro/pc/resources/images/SculptedKeytops_240.jpg" alt="keycap photo" width="120" height="120">The latest trend in keyboards is to have very flat &amp; wide keys, with little or no space between them. You see this a lot on laptops and netbooks. While they look great, they can also be a little tricky to type on. The flatness makes it very easy to slide out of home row and lose your bearings.</p>
			<p>The Ergo&nbsp;Pro bucks this trend. It has traditional sculpted keytops, curved to fit your fingertips, and keep you from sliding out of home position.</p>
		    
		    
			<h2>Audio &amp; media controls.</h2>
			<p>By holding down the Fn key, you gain access to strategically placed keyboard shortcuts for Volume Up&nbsp;/&nbsp;Down, Mute, Pause&nbsp;/&nbsp;Play, Next Track, and Previous Track.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Ghosts busted.</h2>
			<p>Most keyboards allow only a few keys to be pressed at once, so they can’t keep up with very fast typists. The result is called ghosting — letters missing from what you actually typed, or additional letters that you didn’t type.</p>
			
			<p>The Ergo&nbsp;Pro has special Anti-Ghosting Circuitry (also called n-key rollover) to eliminate these problems. You can type as fast as you’re able; the Ergo&nbsp;Pro will keep up.</p>
