				<p>Hello Windows Insiders, today we‚Äôre releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview <strong>Build 19546 </strong>to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring.</p>
<p>If you want a complete look at what build is in which Insider ring, head over to <a href="https://aka.ms/flighthub">Flight Hub</a>. You can also check out the <a href="https://aka.ms/wip-docs">rest of our documentation here</a>, including a list of new features and updates.</p>
<p>Not seeing any of the features in this build? Check your <a href="https://aka.ms/winsider-settings">Windows Insider Settings</a> to make sure you‚Äôre on the Fast ring. <a href="https://aka.ms/InsiderMissingFeature">Submit feedback here</a> to let us know if things weren‚Äôt working the way you expected.</p>

<h2>Introducing Graphing Mode in Windows Calculator</h2>
<p>Today, we‚Äôre updating Windows Calculator for Insiders with a preview of our new <em>graphing mode</em>. Adding support for graphing is one of our top feature requests in Feedback Hub, and we‚Äôre excited to bring this feature to our users. Graphing capabilities are also essential for students who are beginning to explore linear algebra. With this feature, we hope to empower students to learn mathematics by improving their conceptual understanding and attitudes towards math.</p>

<p>Here are a few things you can try out with this new feature:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plot one or more equations on the graph.</strong> Enter multiple equations so that you can compare plots against each other and see interactions between the lines. You can also customize the line style and graph viewing window to suit your needs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add equations with variables.</strong> If you enter an equation with a secondary variable (e.g., ‚Äúy = mx + b‚Äù), you‚Äôll be able to easily manipulate those variables so that you can quickly understand how changes to the equation affect the graph.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Analyze the graph.</strong> Trace plots with your mouse or keyboard to better understand the relationship between variables in the equation on the graph. You can also analyze equations to help identify key graph features, like the x- and y- intercepts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introducing the Indexer Diagnostics app</h2>
<p>Available now in beta via <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N25LZCZWGS4">the Microsoft Store</a>, the Indexer Diagnostics app was created to help enhance your understanding of the capabilities of search, as well as increase the troubleshooting ability and support for general Windows Search issues.</p>
<p>The tool will continue to be improved with more functionality added over time‚Äîas always, appreciate your feedback! The app is available for anyone running Windows 10 version 1809 or higher.</p>

<ul>
<li>We fixed an issue resulting in Timeline not showing any activities.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue resulting in Outlook search not working for some.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue significantly impacting Task View reliability for some.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where pressing Spatial Sound -&gt; Off in the sound menu caused Explorer.exe to crash.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>BattlEye and Microsoft have found incompatibility issues due to changes in the operating system between some Insider Preview builds and certain versions of BattlEye anti-cheat software. To safeguard Insiders who might have these versions installed on their PC, we have applied a compatibility hold on these devices from being offered affected builds of Windows Insider Preview. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4526620/updating-to-some-windows-insider-preview-builds-on-devices-with-certai">See this article for details.</a></li>
<li>We are aware Narrator and NVDA users that seek the latest release of Microsoft Edge based on Chromium may experience some difficulty when navigating and reading certain web content. Narrator, NVDA and the Edge teams are aware of these issues. Users of legacy Microsoft Edge will not be affected. NVAccess has released a <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/post/nvda-2019-3beta2-now-available-for-testing/">beta of NVDA</a><span> that resolves the known issue with Edge. Further information can also be found in the </span><a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/post/in-process-16th-january/">In Process blog post</a><span> that goes into more detail about the beta.</span></li>
<li>The cloud recovery option for Reset this PC isn‚Äôt working on this build. Please use the local reinstall option when performing Reset this PC.</li>
<li>We‚Äôre looking into reports of the update process hanging for extended periods of time when attempting to install a new build.</li>
<li>We‚Äôre investigating reports that some Insiders are unable to update to newer builds with error 0x8007042b.</li>
<li>We‚Äôre looking into reports of certain external USB 3.0 drives not responding with Start Code 10 after they‚Äôre attached.</li>
<li>The Optimize Drives Control Panel is incorrectly reporting that optimization has never run on some devices. Optimization is completing successfully, even though it is not reflected in the UI.</li>
<li>The Documents section under Privacy has a broken icon (just a rectangle).</li>
<li>Remote Desktop Connection crashes when attempting to connect to multiple sessions.</li>
<li>Snipping isn‚Äôt working on secondary monitors.</li>
<li>The IME candidate window for East Asian IMEs (Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and the Japanese IME) may not open sometimes. We are investigating your reports. As a workaround if you encounter this, please change the focus to another application or editing area and back to the original and try again. Alternatively, you can go to Task Manager and end the ‚ÄúTextInputHost.exe‚Äù task from the Details tab, and it should work afterwards.</li>
</ul>
