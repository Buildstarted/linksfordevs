Senator Ron Wyden, one of the few lawmakers vocal about this issue, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/24/fbi-surveillance-devices-may-interfere-with-calls-us-senator-says/">sent a letter in August</a> encouraging the Department of Justice to "be forthright with federal courts about the disruptive nature of cell-site simulators." No response has ever been published.

</p><p>The lack of action could be because it is a big task -- there are hundreds of companies and international bodies involved in the cellular network. The other reason could be that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have a vested interest in exploiting these same vulnerabilities. But law enforcement has other effective tools that are unavailable to criminals and spies. For example, the police can work directly with phone companies, serving warrants and Title III wiretap orders. In the end, eliminating these vulnerabilities is just as valuable for law enforcement as it is for everyone else.</p><p>As it stands, there is no government agency that has the power, funding and mission to fix the problems. Large companies such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, Google and Apple have not been public about their efforts, if any exist.</p></div></div></div></div>
