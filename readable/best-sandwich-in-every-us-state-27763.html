<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The English may have invented the sandwich, but it's safe to say the Americans have perfected it. From the humble grilled cheese to slow-cooked pulled pork, there's something for everyone at establishments across the nation.</p>
<p>Sandwich preferences vary widely from state to state: Some can be held in your hands, much like the original; other behemoths require a fork and knife to dig into. As far as we're concerned, a sandwich is anything between two slices of bread or halves of a roll (burgers and hot dogs notwithstanding â€“ that's a whole other story!), and every one of the 50 states has something exciting in that regard to offer.</p>
<p>To create our list, we first did a deep dive into the culinary history and local specialties of each and every state in order to identify its emblematic sandwich. Once we'd zeroed in on the dish that best represented the local cuisine, we delved into reviews on Yelp, Facebook, Instagram and TripAdvisor to find the restaurants, sandwich shops and food carts that locals claimed were making the very best examples of what their state had to offer.</p>
<p>Did your favorite sandwich make the cut?</p></div></div></div></div>
