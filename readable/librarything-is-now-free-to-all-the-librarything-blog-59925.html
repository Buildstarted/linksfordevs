			<h3>LibraryThing Is Now Free to All</h3>

				<p><a href="https://blog.librarything.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LibraryThingNowFreetoAll.png"><img src="https://blog.librarything.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LibraryThingNowFreetoAll-1024x536.png" alt="LibraryThingNowFreetoAll" width="450" height="236"></a></p>
<p>Starting today, <strong>LibraryThing is free to all!</strong> We’re dropping all membership fees and limits.</p>
<p>Since opening in 2005, LibraryThing&nbsp;has charged a fee to catalog more than 200 books—$10 per year, or $25 for a lifetime. We felt it was important to have customers, not an “audience” we sell to advertisers. So we focused on attracting customers who paid us by choice—and kept us alive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we&nbsp;created a series of products for public and academic libraries. These include <a href="https://proquest.syndetics.com/">Syndetics Unbound</a>, co-developed with ProQuest, which enhances thousands of libraries around the world. We also made&nbsp;<a href="https://www.librarycat.org/">TinyCat</a>, our library catalog for very small libraries. Both of these draw in various ways&nbsp;from LibraryThing infrastructure, software&nbsp;and data, but,&nbsp;in time these have become our primary&nbsp;source of revenue. That gives us the opportunity to make LibraryThing itself entirely free, so nobody has to avoid using LibraryThing because of the cost, or drop a membership for financial reasons. </p>
<p>Our plan was to go free when we rolled out “LT2,” our upcoming redesign. But the coronavirus has changed our plans, along with everyone else’s. A lot of people are now stranded at home, with nothing to do but read and catalog their books, movies, and music. A lot of kids are at home too—free cataloging help. And with the economy in freefall, many are worried about money. We want everyone to be able to use LibraryThing. <strong>This is the right time to go free.</strong></p>
<p>So, starting today, LibraryThing.com, both on the web and using&nbsp;our cataloging app, are free to all, to add as many books as you want. <strong>And, no, we’re not going to add ads.</strong> (We will keep showing a few Google ads to visitors, but they vanish as soon as you become a member.)</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who paid for a membership before. You kept us alive when we needed it. We’ll always be grateful for that.</p>
