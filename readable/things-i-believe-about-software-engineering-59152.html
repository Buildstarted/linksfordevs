            <p>Inspired by <a href="https://gist.github.com/stettix/5bb2d99e50fdbbd15dd9622837d14e2b">Jan Stette's "Things I Believe"</a> post, I decided to write down some of the more contentious beliefs I have about software engineering. I've selected some of my more extreme opinions here, so I expect reasonable people to disagree with me. That's ok.</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing non-trivial software that is correct (for any meaningful definition of correct) is beyond the current capabilities of the human species.</li>
<li>Being aligned with teammates on what you're building is more important than building the right thing.</li>
<li>There are many fundamental discoveries in computer science that are yet to be found.</li>
<li>Peak productivity for most software engineers happens closer to 2 hours a day of work than 8 hours.</li>
<li>Most measures of success are almost entirely uncorrelated with merit.</li>
<li>Thinking about things is a massively valuable and underutilized skill. Most people are trained to not apply this skill.</li>
<li>The fact that current testing practices are considered "effective" is an indictment of the incredibly low standards of the software industry.</li>
<li>How kind your teammates are has a larger impact on your effectiveness than the programming language you use.</li>
<li>The amount of sleep that you get has a larger impact on your effectiveness than the programming language you use.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've omitted explanations of why I believe these things, mostly so that I could get this post out the door at all - each one of these could easily be it's own blog post. Think about them for a bit, and possibly you'll find them compelling :)</p>
