    <h1>Here Are Some of the Women Who Made History in the Midterm Elections</h1>
    <div class="padded"> <p class="dc">Already in 2018, women candidates have <a href="http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/potential-candidate-summary-2018#house">broken the records for the number of candidates for governor</a>, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2018/04/05/record-number-women-file-run-for-house-seats/rxuONDGcoze5heg09xYPDO/story.html">U.S. House</a> and <a href="https://www.apnews.com/0faa6b3475d24ec4a3a2f786a3c07d74">U.S. Senate</a>. And that trend continued in the 2018 midterm elections.</p> <p>The U.S. House of Representatives <a href="https://time.com/5446944/women-midterm-results/">elected a record number of women,</a> with at least 90 women expected to make their way to Washington, D.C. in January.</p> <p>Individual candidates also achieved historic firsts. Democrats Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib <a href="https://time.com/5445303/ilhan-omar-rashida-tlaib-midterm/">became the first Muslim women elected to Congress.</a> Republican Marsha Blackburn <a href="https://time.com/5445358/marsha-blackburn-tennessee-midterms-results/">became Tennessee&#x2019;s first female Senator</a>. Democrats Deb Haaland and Sharice Davids became the first Native American women elected to Congress. Republican Kristi Noem became South Dakota&#x2019;s first female governor.</p> <p>Some trailblazing candidates fell short &#x2014; like Democratic Vermont gubernatorial candidate Christine Hallquist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/us/politics/christine-hallquist-vermont.html">who would have become</a> the nation&#x2019;s first openly transgender governor. Hallquist lost to incumbent governor Phil Scott, who has served since 2017, in the general election.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s a closer look at some of the women who made &#x2014; or could make &#x2014; history in the 2018 midterms.</p> <h2>These candidates made history</h2> <h2><strong>Kyrsten Sinema</strong></h2> <div class="component inline image margin-32-tb"> <div class="image-wrapper"> <div class="component lazy-image no-upscale "> <div class="inner-container js-inner-container "> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p><strong>Became the first openly bisexual senator and the first female senator from Arizona. </strong></p> <p>Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat currently representing Arizona in the House of Representatives, <a href="https://time.com/5444385/arizona-senate-kyrsten-sinema-win-midterms/">defeated</a> Republican Martha McSally in the race for the Arizona senate seat vacated by retiring Republican Jeff Flake.

Kristi Noem defeated Democrat Billie Sutton in the 2018 midterms to become South Dakota&#x2019;s first female governor.</p> <p>Her platform included improving the state&#x2019;s economy and keeping the state free of income tax. During her campaign, Noem <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rep-kristi-noem-on-2018-women-dont-want-to-just-talk-about-womens-issues/">told CBS News that female voters</a> don&#x2019;t &#x201C;just want to talk about women&#x2019;s issues,&#x201D; and said that she focused her campaign on her experience and ideas.</p> <h2>Deb Haaland</h2> <div class="component inline image margin-32-tb"> <div class="image-wrapper"> <div class="component lazy-image no-upscale "> <div class="inner-container js-inner-container "> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p><strong>Became one of the first Native American women elected to Congress.</strong></p> <p>Democrat Deb Haaland, the former chairwoman of New Mexico&#x2019;s Democratic Party, <a href="https://time.com/5304507/deb-haaland-first-native-american-congresswoman/">won</a> New Mexico&#x2019;s 1st Congressional District in the 2018 midterms. She defeated Republican Janice Arnold Jones in the district, which typically votes Democratic.</p> <p>Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, will become one of the first Native American women elected to Congress alongside Democrat Sharice Davids, who won Kansas&#x2019; 3rd Congressional District.

Kevin Yoder for Kansas&#x2019; 3rd Congressional District seat in the 2018 midterms.</p> <p>Davids, a member of Wisconsin&#x2019;s Ho-Chunk Nation tribe and an open lesbian, is also the first openly LGBT person to represent Kansas in Congress. Her <a href="https://www.narf.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017NAVRCsurvey-summary.pdf">win comes amid renewed discussions</a> about the barriers Native Americans face while voting in the U.S.</p> <h2>Marsha Blackburn</h2> <div class="component inline image margin-32-tb"> <div class="image-wrapper"> <div class="component lazy-image no-upscale "> <div class="inner-container js-inner-container "> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p><strong>Became Tennessee&#x2019;s first female Senator. </strong></p> <p>Republican Marsha Blackburn, who currently serves in the U.S. House of Representatives, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-tennessee-marsha-blackburns-embrace-of-trump-tests-her-standing-with-female-voters/2018/05/28/174f085c-621b-11e8-a768-ed043e33f1dc_story.html?utm_term=.baaf7d957da5">became Tennessee&#x2019;s first female senator after winning </a>retiring Republican Sen.

Aside from her age, Ocasio-Cortez has attracted attention for her platform, which she described as <a href="https://time.com/5323584/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democratic-reaction/">democratic socialism</a>. She has advocated for Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage and housing as a human right, among other things.</p> <h2>Ayanna Pressley</h2> <div class="component inline image margin-32-tb"> <div class="image-wrapper"> <div class="component lazy-image no-upscale "> <div class="inner-container js-inner-container "> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p><strong>Became the first black Congresswoman from Massachusetts. </strong></p> <p>Ayanna Pressley, the first black woman to serve on Boston&#x2019;s City Council, became the first black Congresswoman from Massachusetts in the 2018 midterm elections.

Her platform differed little from Capuano, who has been a consistent progressive vote in Congress.
