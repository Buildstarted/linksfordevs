Users will be able to access certificate details by clicking on the locked padlock icon (next to the red arrow in the image). The domain owner's name is outlined in red in the image shown.&nbsp; This change only impacts the way in which EV certificates are displayed in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. The technical properties of the certificate remain unchanged. The display change affects all web pages that are secured by an EV certificate regardless of the activation date or issuing certification authority (CA). </p><p><img alt="EDC SLT Panel" data-cfstyle="max-width: 300px" data-cfsrc="/-/media/images/social/blog-images/2019/ev-cert-blog.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=AF1C50CF0FCECF6EE67B5C27E1727A95"></p><p><strong>WHY EV STILL MATTERS</strong></p><ul class="bulleted-list"><li>EV is used by major anti-phishing services to determine safe websites. Brands with EV will still be treated as more trustworthy by browser filters.</li></ul><ul class="bulleted-list"><li>Organizations that have EV are well positioned for forthcoming regulations in the EU that put identity at the forefront of digital security. Regulations for PSD2 compliance will require financial service providers to secure transactions and open banking APIs with a Qualified Website Certificate (QWAC), which is built upon the foundation of an EV certificate.&nbsp; </li></ul><ul class="bulleted-list"><li>Most browsers are still using EV indicators. &nbsp;Google and Mozilla will continue to use them as well. The changes will require user action to view the detail provided by EV certificates. </li></ul><ul class="bulleted-list"><li>Identity provides the foundation for security. </li><ul class="bulleted-list"><li>Users should be able to easily determine who they are transacting with </li><li>EV is still recognized and used as a best practice for identity verification</li><li>Legitimate organizations still want their identity clearly visible to their users</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Entrust Datacard product impacted:</strong></p><ul class="bulleted-list"><li>EV Multi-domain certificates</li></ul><p><strong>Expected release dates:</strong></p><p>Identity continues to serve as the foundation for digital security. &nbsp;EV certificates are still considered a best practice for securing website transactions and identifying an authentic website. It's interesting that browsers are starting to obscure identity indicators at a time when the trend toward identity transparency is increasing. This trend is indicated in new technological standards such as: <a title="solutions" data-label="Revised  Payment Services Directive (PSD2)" class="track-event" href="/solutions/payment-services-directive-psd2">Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2)</a> and the Federal Office for Information Security in Germany (BSI), for example. </p><p><strong>Additional resources:</strong></p><p>Â© Copyright 2019 Entrust Datacard Corporation.
