We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause. We already have made contact with police department in Japan and a lawyer to consult this situation.</p></blockquote><p>Two things stand out about these breaches, the first being that few of the companies seemed to be aware they’d been breached until contacted for confirmation by journalists.</p><p>A second is the sheer number of breached companies the hackers were able to break into over a period of months.</p><p>The first round of breached data <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/02/15/photography-site-500px-resets-14-8-million-passwords-after-data-breach/">included photography site 500px</a>, which later said the data had been taken from its servers around 5 July 2018. According to ZDNet, five of the six companies in the latest cache data appear to have been breached as recently as last month.</p><p>According to the same report, allegedly, other victims were saved from being named because they agreed to pay an extortion ransom to keep it private.</p><h2>What to do</h2><p>Here’s the list of sites previously known to have been breached as part of the Gnosticplayers leak (in addition to those from the latest cache mentioned above):</p><p>500px, Dubsmash, MyFitnessPal, MyHeritage, ShareThis, HauteLook, Animoto, EyeEm, 8fit, Whitepages, Fotolog, Armor Games, BookMate, CoffeeMeetsBagel, Artsy, DataCamp, Xigo, YouNow, Houzz, Ge.tt, Coinmama, Roll20, Stronghold Kingdoms, PetFlow, Legendas.tv, Jobandtalent, Onebip, StoryBird, StreetEasy, GfyCat, ClassPass, Pizap.</p><p>Anyone who has an account with any of these sites should change their password as soon as possible, regardless of whether they’ve been asked to do so. If two-factor authentication (2FA) is offered, turn it on.</p></div></div></div></div>
