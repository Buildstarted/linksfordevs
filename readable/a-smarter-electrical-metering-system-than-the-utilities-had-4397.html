			<ul><li><strong>Name: Jay Jacobson</strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7460931" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7460931">Patent Number: 7,460,931</a></strong></li><li><strong>Patent: "Method and System for Improving the Efficiency and Reliability of a Power Grid." A system for metering apartment buildings that saves renters money‚Äîbut ended up running afoul of utility companies.</strong> </li></ul><ol></ol><p>I‚Äôve been in the energy conservation business since 1979. I started in renewables and whatnot, and I got into apartment buildings, because at the time only a small company could really service them properly. We were very good at fixing what was broken. And that‚Äôs kind of the way I look at what I do. I hate things that are broken, and when people use more energy than they should, I consider it broken.</p><p>If you looked at the total energy consumption of an apartment building, most of the energy was being used in the units. And the renters pay the bills. But the owner of the building is the one who buys the appliances. So why would the owner, who is a businessman, want to buy, say, a more efficient refrigerator? Well, he wouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a split incentive, as they call it in the field.</p><p>So I tried to change the deal, okay? <br></p><p>The bigger the bill you give the electric company, you can get into cheaper commercial rates. So my solution was to have a new ‚Äúmaster‚Äù meter (A) installed on the building for the utility, then re-meter the units (B) with my own meters. We were able to buy from the utility at commercial rates, then sell to renters at resale rates. I passed some savings on to renters and used some to buy more efficient appliances (C). And that turned into enough of a process that I could patent it.</p><div data-align="center" data-size="medium">

 <p>I never thought I could patent a process. Objects‚Äîthat I knew. But then I was trying to help my nephew, who was a drywaller trying to patent a different way of building Sheetrock stilts because his legs were always hurting, and all of a sudden he started looking into process patents. And I go, What the hell is that? You can patent a method of building a car engine, as an example. You build it with a method that is cheaper, faster, or whatever. You don‚Äôt patent the engine‚Äîit‚Äôs still a 350 Chevy when you‚Äôre done. It‚Äôs just a different way of making it.</p><div data-align="center">

<p>My object was to save energy to prevent pollution. I had long hair at the time. The utilities were more than happy to work with me: Apartment buildings are tough. It‚Äôs a high turnover rate, people skip out on bills. I was getting rid of a problem. Well, then marketing probably got ahold of it and saw I was taking their $8 metering charge, or whatever. Suddenly I‚Äôve got $600,000 of equipment sitting in a warehouse that the utility won‚Äôt let me install. Sued me. Cease-and-desist. It took me five years to beat them in court. But then two years later they changed the rules with the utilities commission to say I couldn‚Äôt mark up the power I was buying from them. By the time I got the patent, it was too late.</p><div data-align="center" data-size="medium">

<p>When I got my patent, it was a shock. Just because I‚Äôm nuts, okay? I‚Äôve always worked outside the box. Or as my father used to tell people: My son has never seen the box. I‚Äôve always looked at things differently, and most people assume that means I‚Äôm an idiot. So I really liked getting a patent. I could feel good about my ideas.</p><hr><p><em>This appears in the March 2019 issue. Tell us your patent story at editor@popularmechanics.com.</em><br></p>
