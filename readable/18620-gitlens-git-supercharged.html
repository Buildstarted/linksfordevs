I ‚ù§ open-source ‚Äî both building and contributing. I love the collaboration and the sharing of knowledge driven by the open-source movement.</p><p>At the same time, open-source comes with a cost, of which gets paid by trading time and energy from other areas ‚Äî for me it is usually sleep üí§, but sometimes also family. Of course, by sponsoring me and my work, you can't create time, but you can certainly help increase the reward aspect of trading this precious time and help ensure that it continues.</p><p>I spend a lot of my ‚Äúfree‚Äù time building and maintaining GitLens and have for well over 3 years now. From its very humble beginnings, GitLens has grown wildly beyond my expectations ‚Äî in both its reach as well as its demands on my time and attention. GitLens now has over 4 million installs (~34M downloads üò±) and is used by teams of all sizes, from single devs to enterprise teams. I also author and maintain many other VS Code extensions (and have ideas for many more) as well as contribute to many open-source projects.</p><p>üíñ Thank you for your future sponsorship! And to my incredible sponsors ‚Äî thank you so much for your contributions. I am truly humbled by your generosity and support.</p><p>While GitLens is generously offered to everyone free of charge, if you find it useful, please consider supporting it.
