<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A common issue I see is understanding the flow of commands, events and queries within a typical CQRS ES based system. The following post is designed to clear up what happens at each step. Hopefully this will help you to reason about your code and what each part does.<span id="more-134"></span></p><div><p><a href="https://danielwhittaker.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CQRS-flow.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_637,h_397/https://danielwhittaker.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CQRS-flow.jpg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_637,h_397/https://danielwhittaker.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CQRS-flow.jpg" alt="CQRS and Event Source Diagram" width="637" height="397"></a></p><p>A diagram of the typical flow of a CQRS and Event Sourced architecture</p></div><h2>What is CQRS and what does it stand for?</h2><p><strong>CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. It is an architectural programming pattern. It is based on the idea that there are significant benefits resulting from seperating code for the â€˜writeâ€™ and the â€˜readâ€™ parts of an application.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This makes more sense when you consider the number of reads to a database in order to display infomration in a typical business application, such as a blog CMS or customer ralationship manager, compared to the number of times you write to the database.</p><p>Given that premise, the following is typically how you would structure the various elements of the architecture.</p><h2>1. A Command is generated from the UI</h2><p>The UI displays data to the user. The user generates a command by requesting some form of change. This implies a different style of user interface sometimes known as a <strong>Task Based UI.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>UIâ€™s today often reflect the CRUD idea where data is layed out and you make changes. But in contrast, a task based UI leads a user through a task. To make this difference more clear take the following example:</p><p>Changing an address.</p><p>In a CRUD based system, the address would be displayed and the address changed. But the system would not know <em>why&nbsp;</em>the address was changed. Was it due to a spelling mistake or because the customer has moved house?</p><p>In contrast, a <span>task-based </span> approach would allow the user to request to change the address because the customer is moving house. This can be of great importance to a business as it may trigger new offers or change the <span>perceived </span>risk etc.</p><h2>2. The Message Router or Bus receives the command</h2><p>The message bus is responsible for routing the command to its handler. Each command by definition is handled by a single handler.</p><p>This concept of routing the command allows your system to remain flexible and easy to maintain. You can create a pipeline for every command to follow which could do things like checking a user has <span>permission </span>and superficial validation and or record application performance data. The options are endless.</p><h2>3. The handler prepares the aggregate root</h2><p>The handler gets the <a title="Aggregate Root" href="https://danielwhittaker.me/2014/11/15/aggregate-root-cqrs-event-sourcing/">aggregate root</a> and applies all previous events to it. This brings the AR (aggregate root) up to itâ€™s latest state. This is typically very fast, even with thousands of events, however, if this becomes a performance bottleneck, a snapshotting process can be adopted to overcome this issue.</p><p>Aggregate roots are what is commonly known as â€˜domain objectsâ€™. These are distinct from typical domain layers objects as they have no getters and setters (other than a getter for the ID). These objects are <strong>not</strong> designed to be <span>queryable</span>. They contain all the functionality and or other classes designed to perform some business role.</p><h2>4. The command is issued</h2><p>Once the <a title="Aggregate Root" href="https://danielwhittaker.me/2014/11/15/aggregate-root-cqrs-event-sourcing/">AR</a> is up to date the command is issued. The AR then ensures it can run the command and works out what would need to change but <strong>DOESNâ€™T</strong>&nbsp; at this point change anything. Instead, it builds up the event or events that need to be applied to actually change its state. It then applies them to itself. This part is crucial and is what allows â€˜eventsâ€™ to be re-run in the future. The command phase can be thought of as the behaviour and the apply phase is the state transition.</p><h2>5. The command handler requests the changes</h2><p>At this point, assuming no exceptions have been raised, the command handler requests the uncommitted changes. Note that <strong><em>no</em></strong> persistence has actually taken place yet. The domain classes have no dependencies on external services. This makes them much easier to write and ensures they are not polluted by persistence requirements (Iâ€™m look at you Entity Framework).</p><h2>6. The command handler requests persistence of the uncommitted events</h2><p>Here is when an event storage service comes into play. Its responsibility is to persist the events and also to ensure that no concurrency conflicts occur. You can read up on how to do this on a previous post of mine: <a title="Handling concurrency issues in a CQRS and Event Sourced system" href="https://danielwhittaker.me/2014/09/29/handling-concurrency-issues-cqrs-event-sourced-system/">How to handle concurrency issues in a CQRS Event Sourced system</a>.</p><h2>7. The events are published onto the Bus or Message Router</h2><p>Unlike commands which only trigger 1 command handler, events can be routed to multiple de-normalisers. This enables you to build up very flexible optimised read models.</p><h2>8. De-normalisers build up the Read Model</h2><p>The concept of a <a title="How to Build a Master Details View when using CQRS and Event Sourcing" href="https://danielwhittaker.me/2014/10/05/build-master-details-view-using-cqrs-event-sourcing/">de-normaliser</a> can at first be a little tricky. The problem is that we are all trained to think in â€˜entitiesâ€™, â€˜modelsâ€™ or â€˜tablesâ€™. Generally these are derived from normalised data and glued together into the form required for the front end. This process often involves complex joins, views and other database query techniques. A <a title="How to Build a Master Details View when using CQRS and Event Sourcing" href="https://danielwhittaker.me/2014/10/05/build-master-details-view-using-cqrs-event-sourcing/">de-normaliser </a>on the hand translates certain events into the perfect form required for the various screens in your system. No joins required at all, ever! This makes reads, <em>very fast</em> and is the basis behind the claim that this style architecture is, almost, linearly scalable.</p><p>Most people begin to get twitchy at this point when they realise that duplicate data may exist in the read model. The important thing to remember is that the â€˜event streamâ€™ <strong>is the only source of truth</strong> and there is no (or should be no) accidental duplication within it. This allows you to re-create the entire read model or just parts of it, at will.</p><h2>9. Data Transfer Objects are persisted to the Read Model</h2><p>The final phase of the de-normaliser is to persist the simple DTOâ€™s (data transfer objects) to the database. These objects and essentially property buckets and usually contain the ID of the aggregate they are associated with and a version number to aid in concurrency checking. These DTOâ€™s provide the information the user requires, in order to form new commands and start the cycle over again.</p><h2>All this results in a Highly Optimised Read Side Model</h2><p>The read/query side is entirely independent of the commands and events, hence CQRS (Command Query Responsibility <strong><em>Segregation</em></strong>). The query side of the application is designed to issue queries against the read model for DTOâ€™s. This process is made entirely trivial due to the de-normalisation of the read data.</p><h2>A. User requests data</h2><p>All the data is optimised for reading. This makes querying very simple. If you require values for a â€˜type-ahead drop-down listâ€™, just get the items from an optimised list designed especially for the task. No extra data need be supplied apart from that required to drive the dropdown. The helps keep the weight of the data payload light which in turn helps the application remain responsive to the user.</p><h2>B. Simple Data Transfer Objects</h2><p>The read model just returns simple and slim DTOâ€™s that are, as I said before easy to work with on the front end.</p><h2>In Conclusion</h2><p>CQRSâ€™s biggest hurdle is itâ€™s perceived complexity. Donâ€™t be fooled by all the steps above. Unlike a â€˜simple CRUDâ€™ approach which starts off simple but quickly gains in complexity over time. This approach remains relatively resistant to increased complexity in the scope of the application.</p> </div></div></div>
