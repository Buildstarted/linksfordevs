                <p>The Mission of JuneteenthConf is to provide a judgment free space for underrepresented people in tech to learn and grow and to amplify their voices. To be a counterbalance to the biases, implicit or otherwise, that hold our industry and our society back.</p><p>This will be our first JuneteenthConf and we are so excited to see you there!</p><p>"<br>Juneteenth is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States. Dating back to 1865, it was on June 19th that the Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, landed at Galveston, Texas with news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were free. Note that this was two and a half years after President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation - which had become official January 1st, 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation had little impact on the Texans due to the minimal number of Union troops to enforce the new Executive Order. However, with the surrender of General Lee in April of 1865, and the arrival of General Granger’s regiment, the forces were finally strong enough to influence and overcome the resistance.</p><p>On June 19th, 1865, Union General Gordon Granger led thousands of federal troops to Galveston, Texas, to announce that the Civil War had ended, and slaves had been freed. Approximately 250,000 Texan slaves had no idea that the government had secured their freedom.</p><p>"</p><p>~ Elizabeth Stephens</p>
