    Loved by Scott Hanselman
</h2><p><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a> is a software developer
    who knows a thing or two about great tools. He's downloaded and used pretty much
    every piece of software on the internet and Scott's giant list of tools (at <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/tools">
        hanselman.com/tools
    </a>) is widely read and used by developers everywhere.
    What does he think of NimbleText? <strong>
        Scott rates NimbleText as one of his "BIG
        TEN LIFE AND WORK-CHANGING UTILITIES"
    </strong></p><blockquote><h2><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/tools"><img src="/images/ScottHanselman.png" title="Scott Hanselman"></a><br>BIG TEN LIFE AND WORK-CHANGING UTILITIES:
    </h2><p><span>NimbleText</span> – Regular Expressions are hard and I'm
        not very smart. NimbleText lets me do crazy stuff with large amounts of text without
        it hurting so much.
        <br>—<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a></p></blockquote><h2>
    Stop! Wait! What's all this about Regular Expressions?
</h2><p>
    Did he mention regular expressions? Regular Expressions are hard. NimbleText is
    secretly powered by regular expressions, but YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW THAT. You don't
    have to know a single thing about regular expressions to be an expert at using NimbleText.
</p><p>
    Let me give you a metaphor. You can sit on a fine timber chair without being an
    expert carpenter. Similarly you can get the benefits and power of regular expressions
    without actually writing them yourself. <strong>This is called the Zen of NimbleText.</strong></p><blockquote><center><strong>Free your mind and your text will follow.</strong></center><img src="/images/george-clinton.jpg" class="rightHere" title="George Clinton of Parliament Funk: Free your mind and your text will follow."><br></blockquote><h2>
    Years of Work
</h2><p>
    Almost a decade of work has gone into NimbleText. It was initially a very simple
    tool called 'The Programmers Mate'. In the 10 years since then it has been completely
    rewritten many times and continually refined and sharpened. It is a labour of love
    between man and keyboard.
</p><p>
    Every time I catch myself performing a repetitive task I stop and assess the situation.
    <strong>This is my curse and this is also my gift to you.</strong> NimbleText is
    the product of that continual analysis of the repetitive nature of the work we're
    all performing.
</p><p>
    On top of that I have many years of Engineering experience, bringing rock-solid
    products to market, and carefully fine-tuning every aspect of the product to make
    it dependable, comfortable and well-balanced. NimbleText, in the hands of a user,
    should have the same easy nature as any hand-crafted tool from a master craftsman.

    Database Professionals, NimbleText is for you!
</h2><p>
    NimbleText is great for generating SQL statements. If you write a lot of SQL, then
    this is a vital tool.
</p><p>
    Need to <a href="/HowTo/GenerateInsert">generate an insert statement</a>? NimbleText
    has you covered. Want to <a href="/HowTo/GenerateUpdate">make an update statement</a>?
</p><p>
    Or to <a href="/HowTo/OneQueryManyTables">run one query against many tables?</a></p><p>
    I bet you do! You do that all the time, and so does NimbleText!
</p><p>
    Give those tired fingers a rest, <strong>let NimbleText do the boring repetitive stuff</strong>,
    so you can get on with the thinking!

    Software Developers, You'll Love NimbleText!
</h2><p>
    No matter what language you write in, NimbleText speaks your language.
</p><p>
    NimbleText generates Javascript, it generates C#, it generates Java, it generates
    Ruby. You know the secret already: code is just text, and NimbleText manipulates
    text with less effort and greater versatility than any tool around.
</p><p>
    Want to transform a list of column names into a class definition? NimbleText can
    do that.
</p><p>
    Want to reverse a bunch of assignments? No sweat.
</p><p>
    Want to format a bunch of numbers into an array, or bind members of an array to
    a series of controls: those little bits of repetitive code that crop up all the
    time are best done with NimbleText.
</p><img src="/images/monkey_135465557_175bc49efc_o.jpg" alt="happy monkey" class="rightHere" title="You're not a monkey doing monkey work... Leave that to NimbleText!"><h2>
    Stop doing the repetitive monkey work!
</h2><p>
    You don't get <strong>paid the big dollars</strong> because you manipulate text,
    you get the big money because you think clearly, solve real problems and add real
    value.
</p><p>
    So hand the text manipulation and the monkey work to NimbleText. It will free up
    your wonderful brain to do the unique and special things you do so well!
</p><h2>
    Data Analysts, NimbleText is the solution!
</h2><p>
    You're the clever-clogs who turns the company's messed up data into something meaninful
    that gets the big bosses excited.
</p><p>
    And you know the data doesn't turn up all neat and ready for crunching. It has to
    be formatted, and <a href="/Help/Where/">filtered</a> and sorted and beaten into
    shape before you can even begin to make head or tail of it. That's where our Nimble
    friend comes in!
</p><p>
    Need to grab the fifth column, but only in rows where the third column is empty?
    Messy little jobs like that happen all the time. Put NimbleText to work, and the
    messy data you're receiving will be ship shape in a flash!
</p><img src="/images/frustrated_25.jpg" alt="frustrated businessman" class="rightHere" title="Spreadsheets getting you down?"><h2>
    Spreadsheets Getting You Down?
</h2><p>
    The enterprise sure does love its spreadsheets! And you're the girl or guy they
    call when the problem is too tricky for their own spreadsheet skills.
</p><p>
    Whether it's mistreating text as numbers, or insisting that a number is a date,
    spreadsheets are often the wrong tool for the job. NimbleText has <a href="/Help/DateFormat/">
        versatile date formatting
    </a> features, and <a href="/Home/Professional/">
        other
        goodies
    </a> to get the job done.
</p><h2>
    This Is Serious TADMAP!
</h2><p>
    When you want to perform some <em>serious TADMAP</em>, you need a tool like NimbleText
    that excels at <em>TADMAP</em></p><p>
    (What's TADMAP? <em><a href="/Home/Tadmap" rel="Appendix">
