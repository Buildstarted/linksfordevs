This version of Babylon.js is a major step forward in one of the world’s leading WebGL-based, graphics engines. Babylon.js 4.0 represents an incredible amount of hard work by a very passionate community of developers from around the world, and it is our honor to share it with all of you.</p><figure class="gl gm gn go gp gq"><p id="c8fd" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu">From a new visual scene inspector, best-in-class physically-based rendering, countless performance optimizations, and much more, Babylon.js 4.0 brings powerful, beautiful, simple, and open 3D to everyone on the web. Babylon.js has come a long way from its humble beginnings, and version 4.0 is our biggest update yet.</p><p id="e793" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu"><strong class="fv gu">Visual Scene Inspector</strong></p><p id="d76e" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu">Along with new capabilities in the Babylon.js engine, we also want to improve the overall development experience with better debugging tools. Babylon.js 4.0 includes a new inspector tool which helps developers and artists setup or debug a scene. The inspector lets you configure and test all aspects of a Babylon.js scene like textures, materials, lighting, etc. For example, the properties panel in the inspector window can be used to configure all aspects of the updated physically-based material system.</p><figure class="gl gm gn go gp gq cl cm paragraph-image"><figcaption class="bo en hj hk hl cn cl cm hm hn bj em">Babylon.js inspector</figcaption></figure><p id="2aaa" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu">You can learn more about the inspector and how to use it in our video tutorial series: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsaE__vWcRalvl-IVLePqGSmQWnlXD54m" class="at cg gh gi gj gk" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Intro to Inspector</a>.</p><p id="6fd7" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu"><strong class="fv gu">Smaller Download Size</strong></p><figure class="gl gm gn go gp gq"><p id="62fd" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu">The entire Babylon.js codebase has been moved to independent modules (ECMAScript 6). This will enable developers to create optimized payloads for the Babylon.js engine and reduce the overall download size. For simple 3D object viewing scenarios, we are seeing <strong class="fv gu">up to 80% smaller download payloads</strong>. The modularized engine is available as part of Babylon.js 4.0 and you can find out how to take full advantage of it <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/es6_support" class="at cg gh gi gj gk" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p id="21e9" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu"><strong class="fv gu">Faster Performance</strong></p><figure class="gl gm gn go gp gq cl cm paragraph-image"><p id="9b9f" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu">A fast, high performance engine is one of the core principles for Babylon.js. Babylon.js 4.0 includes many performance optimizations, making it on average 15% faster than previous releases. In addition, we have also added support for new WebGL extensions like <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/OVR_multiview2/" class="at cg gh gi gj gk" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">multi-view</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/KHR_parallel_shader_compile/" class="at cg gh gi gj gk" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">parallel shader compilation</a>, so you can take advantage of the latest web graphics technologies.</p><p id="fe9e" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu"><strong class="fv gu">Realistic Rendering</strong></p><figure class="gl gm gn go gp gq"><p id="93a9" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu">A common request around rendering real world objects is to improve the realism of certain materials like fabric, glassware and metallic paint. To enable more realistic rendering of these materials, Babylon.js 4.0 adds new capabilities to its physically-based materials such as clear coat, anisotropy, sheen and sub-surface scattering. You can learn more about these new rendering capabilities <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/physically_based_rendering_master" class="at cg gh gi gj gk" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p id="8fe3" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu"><strong class="fv gu">Better Physics and More</strong></p><p id="b455" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu">Babylon.js already has a plugin system that enables developers to choose their own physics engine. Now Babylon.js 4.0 includes support for the <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/using_the_physics_engine" class="at cg gh gi gj gk" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ammo.js physics engine</a> as a plugin. The ammo.js plugin brings new capabilities like soft-body physics where you can simulate interactions between objects like cloth or rope. This <a href="https://aka.ms/babylonjs/4/physics" class="at cg gh gi gj gk" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">demo</a> showcases the many physical interactions that can be simulated using the ammo.js plugin.</p><figure class="gl gm gn go gp gq cl cm paragraph-image"><p id="90af" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu">These are a few highlights of the new capabilities available in Babylon.js 4.0. There are many more capabilities for you to explore like <a href="https://aka.ms/babylonjs/4/trailmesh" class="at cg gh gi gj gk" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Trail Mesh</a> and <a href="https://aka.ms/babylonjs/4/motionblur" class="at cg gh gi gj gk" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Motion Blur</a>.

Alongside version 4.0, we’re also very happy to introduce you to the new look for Babylon.</p><figure class="gl gm gn go gp gq cl cm paragraph-image"><p id="ab96" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu">Starting today, Babylon.js has a bold new identity and a freshly designed website that reflects a “future of dimensionality.” We see a future where 3D web experiences are as accessible as photos and video are today. By unlocking the power of 3D for developers and artists across the web, we see a more open, entertaining, and interactive online world…and it was important to us, that our brand boldly represent that vision.</p><figure class="gl gm gn go gp gq cl cm paragraph-image"><a href="https://www.babylonjs.com"></a></figure><p id="624a" class="ft fu dc bk fv b fw fx fy fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg cu"><a href="https://www.babylonjs.com">Whether you are just starting your journey with web-based 3D or you are a seasoned professional, we sincerely hope that you’ll find something unique and delightful with Babylon.js 4.0. It’s built <em class="hw">by</em> people like you <em class="hw">for </em>people like you.</a></p></figure></figure></figure></figure></figure></figure></div></div></div></div>
