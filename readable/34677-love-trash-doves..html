From the outside, to most, I think it looked fun. And some of it was. But it was also huge, terrible, wonderful, terrifying, sickening, and just altogether inexplicable &#x2014;The improbable explosion of my work online changed my life and the course of my illustration career entirely.</em></p><p id="e7fd" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc"><em class="kd">I&#x2019;ve had journalistic offers and suggestions to host this story in other ways &#x2014; but I am simply no longer interested in documenting the phenomenon in the way that would require me to share every single awful screenshot of the threats I received, call out entities involved outside of narrative context, or revisit any battle over which my interest is expired.</em></p><p id="0d8f" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc"><em class="kd">I have used a few speaking opportunities to tell this story in person (thank you, LGAL Team Tern and the CSCA audience for sitting through my traumatized recount) but now &#x2014; I simply wish to share the story from my perspective, as I remember it happening &#x2014; to let it out, talk about it, and grow from there.</em></p><figure class="kf kg kh ki kj dw v w paragraph-image"><img alt class="fm n o fl x" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/400/1*UETlbADKgLaZ_FyBE7ZyqA.png" width="200"></figure><p id="de28" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">In September of 2016, I was living in my southern US college town and working as an <a href="https://www.adobe.com/about-adobe/creative-residency.html" class="bb cn lm ln lo lp">Adobe Creative Resident</a>. This meant traveling extensively, meeting interesting people in my field, and being paid to paint &#x2014; the absolute dream. Because of their support, I was streaming my painting process daily on Twitch Creative and Adobe&#x2019;s Twitch channel, exploring my style and sharing my workflow, and developing a dedicated community for my work. I was only 5-months post-undergrad &#x2014; it felt like there was no where to go but up.</p><p id="1d0f" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">A month prior, Apple had updated iMessage to include a sticker store. A good friend and fellow illustrator with an equal lack of coding skills figured out that it was quite easy to develop sets, and suggested that I also make some to upload and sell.</p><figure class="kf kg kh ki kj dw fj lr cl ls lt lu lv lw bi lx ly lz ma mb mc paragraph-image"><img alt class="fm n o fl x" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4514/1*1kvWaCufnY0QGsNyFqvzHQ.jpeg" width="2257"><figcaption class="bw du mh mi hc cs v w mj mk br dt">original pigeon drawings made in Loring Park, Minneapolis</figcaption></figure><p id="d69b" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">I thought, fun! I sat down for a weekend, and based on some pigeons I&#x2019;d doodled earlier in the summer while in Loring Park, Minneapolis, drew and animated nearly an entire set &#x2014; and streamed the whole process as a novelty. It became a small marathon to finish &#x2014; with my community and following hyped for a new fun thing.</p><p id="20d2" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">I submitted them to the App Store, made a bizarre set of gifs to market the pack, and tossed it to the internet. They were immediately quite popular, got an App Store feature, and good pigeon fun was had all around &#x2014; over the next two months, I released an update with new stickers and a followup pack for the holiday. Fans of the Doves began asking for them on other platforms &#x2014; namely Facebook Messenger.</p><p id="3784" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">While at Adobe Max, a Facebook representative came by the Residency booth and excitedly kept one of the free vinyl Doves stickers we&#x2019;d had printed. They said they would pass my info onto the Messenger team, who would likely want to put the Doves on the platform. I wasn&#x2019;t optimistic &#x2014; I had been trying to get the right contact for that for a while. Several weeks later, however, I did get an email &#x2014; Facebook was interested in having the Doves on Messenger.</p><p id="350e" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc"><em class="kd">I can&#x2019;t talk freely about my dealings with Facebook due to NDA.</em></p><p id="f84b" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">A few weeks of signing and file processing later, the Doves were live on Facebook. Anyone registered on the platform could download the pack and use them in onsite comments or within the desktop/mobile direct messaging client. My work at the fingertips of billions of people &#x2014; for free.</p><p id="9aa4" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">The US had a rough couple of months between the Doves iMessage and Facebook releases. Namely &#x2014; the presidential election, aftermath and inauguration. I spent several weekends over these months streaming charity commission drawings, running online donation drives for Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, and generally being very outspoken against Trump.</p><p id="a703" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">I woke up on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning, about a week and a half after they&#x2019;d been released, to a flurry of phone notifications. My then-partner had already gotten up and left the house &#x2014; I laid in bed alone, scrolling in blurry disbelief through hundreds of unknown names names sending my private Facebook page messages in a language I couldn&#x2019;t read, all followed by my stickers.</p><p id="89eb" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">I got to message that shared a video &#x2014; posted to a large Thai meme/content page &#x2014; of my bird, composited over live footage to make it dance with people in an office. The video had thousands of views, shares and reacts.</p><figure class="kf kg kh ki kj dw"></figure><p id="6398" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">Over the Floridian night, on the other side of the world, my bird had become a viral meme in Thailand &#x2014; and was quickly spreading. A few kind souls among the message influx had reached out to me to explain, in English, what was happening on their social media &#x2014; culturally (and this is my rough understanding,) &#x2018;to be birded&#x2019; was the equivalent of &#x2018;being put in the friendzone&#x2019; and my flailing purple bird had become a new symbol of this concept. Facebook users were posting the sticker consecutively in message threads &#x2014; clicking &#x2018;expand&#x2019; on a post with hundreds to thousands of replies would reveal that every comment was just a Trash Dove sticker.</p><p id="1659" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">Because the sticker set was credited to my name on the official Messenger sticker page, the small Facebook page I had for posting my art &#x2014; previously at around 200 page &#x2018;likes&#x2019; (mostly family and friends) &#x2014; was nearing the 10k mark.</p><p id="2857" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">It was fairly easy to find my personal profile as well &#x2014; I was not a regular platform user, my privacy settings were mostly at default &#x2014; thousands of people all over the world were now &#x2018;following&#x2019; me there too. They were able to see personal posts and comments, photo tags of me from friends with lax permissions, &#x2018;likes&#x2019; and family/relationship connections. Strangers had begun to litter my own comment fields with my dancing bird (and based on the perceived gender demographic of users commenting on my personal photos, I began to very personally contextualize how it had been weirdly sexualized.) I locked the account privacy settings down and pointed everyone who did not belong back to my professional pages.</p><p id="2184" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">I made a public fan page for the Doves as well, alongside my own public profile, and worked with Facebook to verify it in response to dozens of unofficial fan pages that had cropped up. Pages sharing user-made memes and videos about the dancing bird that were posing as official outlet for the character, and not always representing the bird in the best light with some of the more mean-spirited memes.</p><p id="5914" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">I had previously made this drawing of the pigeon holding a flag for the US election (woof&#x2026;) To make a quick social media post acknowledging the phenomenon, I swapped out the Thai flag for the US dots and stripes, and posted a &#x2018;Thank You, Thailand!&#x2019; message on Facebook. However, though I meant entirely well, I got myself into a bit of a pickle.</p><figure class="kf kg kh ki kj dw v w paragraph-image"><img alt class="fm n o fl x" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1992/1*QT9aCSli7W3wmjV0s2FuWQ.jpeg" width="996"></figure><p id="44f9" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">I had no idea that in Thai culture, the flag was considered sacred. I also had no clue that feet were considered very lowly and unclean, and to have the bird hold the Thai flag with its foot (it doesn&#x2019;t have any hands) was very offensive to many traditionally-minded Thai nationals. People began posting angry messages that Google could only half-translate &#x2014; many cursing me and asking why I hated Thailand &#x2014; I contacted a Thai friend from college, who explained to me the situation, and suggested I make a new post to smooth things over &#x2014; I created a new thank-you note, with the flag in the beak instead, and shared that with a small apology.</p><figure class="kf kg kh ki kj dw v w paragraph-image"><img alt class="fm n o fl x" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5284/1*7_ZUoAauWf8Gc9rOD-b-8Q.jpeg" width="2642"></figure><p id="ad01" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">I really don&#x2019;t know if this worked. Thailand, I am still sorry. I&#x2019;d like to visit your beautiful country one day &#x2014; please don&#x2019;t hate me.</p><p id="d9c8" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">The bird spam quickly lost its specific social meaning, but from there &#x2014; and apparently for the pure novelty of it &#x2014; a wave of my dancing birds washed over comment threads everywhere. Over the next two or three days, I began receiving messages reporting sightings across Taiwan, The Philippines, Japan and South Korea &#x2014; people were confused, annoyed, but mostly amused &#x2014; and were trying to understand the big, inexplicable joke.</p><p id="1dbe" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">Interview requests from Asian channels and blogs popped up, and responding to them meant talking to their daytime reporters in the middle of the night, my local time. In return for this, I saw my face, my dog (?) and my bird art on Thai PBS, among other news broadcasts and outlets &#x2014; just two or three days after it had all begun. Many of the interviewers asked me if I had planned for this to happen &#x2014; I told them that I certainly didn&#x2019;t. Many asked about the foot thing, and I continued my apology tour to the best of my fumbling diplomatic ability.</p><figure class="kf kg kh ki kj dw v w paragraph-image"><img alt class="fm n o fl x" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*1yDHDr58Z-C31FUsnbZrNg.jpeg" width="960"><figcaption class="bw du mh mi hc cs v w mj mk br dt">Thai PBS (I still have no idea what this says)</figcaption></figure><p id="148d" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">Because I couldn&#x2019;t read most of the articles, comments or spin-off memes being generated, I truly don&#x2019;t believe I ever had or will have insight into much of the vortex Asian internet created at the time &#x2014; or the experience as a whole from this perspective. I am still at an everyday loss to explain any of that aspect of it to myself, and it still feels extremely surreal.</p><figure class="kf kg kh ki kj dw v w paragraph-image"><img alt class="fm n o fl x" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*6_hmPGo4lWXJJii2uuVbvQ.jpeg" width="960"><figcaption class="bw du mh mi hc cs v w mj mk br dt">Fanart of me with my birds, sent to me early on &#x2014; I was never able to find the original post and source, but I loved this one a lot.</figcaption></figure><p id="a29d" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">The first weekend into this strange cycle, I was up late streaming games with friends. I think I had around 60 viewers hanging around (I was playing an early, now-unrecognizable version of Astroneer, just to de-stress and keep myself up for another night of the Asian/European news cycle) and the chat vibe was chill and fun. My follower notification pinged, and I looked at the chat to thank the newcomer by name &#x2014;only to see that the username listed was, simply, my house number and street address. Someone was letting me know that they knew where I was &#x2014; a quiet, idle threat often used by harassers to scare a streamer into thinking they may be in danger. Panic sparked, but I stayed calm &#x2014; I let my moderator know what was happening, blocked the account and flushed my notifications, and told my chat that I was going to the restroom.</p><p id="259e" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">I paused my game, muted the stream and called my Twitch partnerships manager&#x2014; she was in line for pizza after work, a detail I realize is strange to remember. I was told to shut my stream down and call the local police in the event that I was being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting" class="bb cn lm ln lo lp">swatted</a>. I signed off, citing tiredness while not letting my viewers know what had happened and called the non-emergency line. By now, it was well past midnight &#x2014; the deputy working late-night desk duty boredly listened to me tell my story (birds and all,) took my name down, but told me that they couldn&#x2019;t do anything unless a direct threat was made to my safety, that he didn&#x2019;t know what else to tell me.</p><p id="19b2" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">While scrolling through my backed-up Facebook message inbox to make sure no other threats using my address had been sent (there were, actually, I got to call the cops back &#x2014; they still didn&#x2019;t care,) I noticed several others from an anonymous individual &#x2014; obviously a fake name, recently created account, no profile photos. The message basically read, &#x2018;I keep an eye on some scary parts of the Internet and wanted to let you know that these people are talking about you,&#x2019; and linked to 4Chan /pol. At the time, I had very little idea about that particular forum &#x2014; I did not frequent the site as a teenager &#x2014; but I feel it needs no explanation past this today, aside from, it&#x2019;s a festering campground for the alt-right/fascists/neo-nazis.</p><p id="6f10" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">Remember <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/46133193/Smiling-Faces-Avatars-for-Charity" class="bb cn lm ln lo lp">what I was doing</a> right before the virality boom? Raising money for Planned Parenthood, being generally very outspoken against the American election results? That I was a &#x2018;purple-haired, feminist Hillary-supporter&#x2019; was the consensus /pol had arrived at, and they thought I should be punished for my sudden burst of visibility and artwork success.</p><p id="561e" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">I scrolled through threads of people talking about me, sharing photos of me that were found online (both personal and professional images of my likeness.) Many were asking what my bird was, making fun of it/blaming its movement on various disabilities while admiring the Asian Facebook users for creating a nuisance of a meme &#x2014; and because of its popularity and their newfound personal dislike of me, early discussions of how to co-opt the imagery for their own subliminal messaging. Even scarier still, at the time, were a few individuals mentioning attempts to find my address, trawling the internet for personal information like government ID and banking logins, and tracking down the names and addresses of my immediate family.</p><p id="67af" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">I showed them to my partner, who was now becoming equally as concerned after the address threats. I messaged both Adobe and Facebook contacts about the doxxing and the forum discussion &#x2014; then poured myself an even larger glass of wine, got as drunk as I could to try to go to sleep, and laid fitful until morning &#x2014; the Monday after everything had started.</p><figure class="kf kg kh ki kj dw fj lr cl ls lt lu lv lw bi lx ly lz ma mb mc paragraph-image"><img alt class="fm n o fl x" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5100/1*0SmpYDamGQ766Qxsk2PJIg.jpeg" width="2550"></figure><p id="8de3" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">Messages from new places started coming in as more countries woke up. People in Great Britain from Brazil to South Africa were sending the birds greetings and welcoming them to their countries as the global user base of Facebook began to join the bird dance party in comment boxes everywhere.</p><p id="64bf" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">I made a drawing of the Dove standing on the world and posted on the official page, asking people to comment where they were visiting from &#x2014; the geographical variety of reply staggered me.

Western print-on-demand sites (notorious for looking the other way when it came to user image upload licensing) became infested with stolen Trash Doves merchandise. Shirts, stickers, patches, buttons, mugs, pillows, and cheap socks with an 200x200 pixel image downloaded from google search slapped onto them became widely available for purchase.</p><p id="1016" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">Companies and personalities piggybacked onto the meme phenomenon, most not considering licensing or legalities &#x2014; just using the hype to run ads or use the bird for other marketing purposes.</p><figure class="kf kg kh ki kj dw v w paragraph-image"><img alt class="fm n o fl x" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*8Ft2-zZPBf2StHaa06IDQg.jpeg" width="640"><figcaption class="bw du mh mi hc cs v w mj mk br dt">do i really need to caption this one</figcaption></figure><p id="5ef8" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">Knockoff apps appeared on the App Store, Google and other marketplaces.

I explained to him what had happened, sobbing &#x2014; by my sheer luck, he knew someone who knew someone. I sat down and put together an appeal, citing every single good article, piece of fanart, cosplay video, statistic I was permitted to share, and even cases of theft by &#x2018;reputable&#x2019; companies using the Doves to advertise illegally&#x2014;and I was assured that my case would be escalated to the review board and deliberated immediately.</p><p id="2662" class="jp jq fo bs jr b js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc">My parents called &#x2014; both of them on the phone at once, unusual &#x2014; they suspected things weren&#x2019;t going well.

I&#x2019;m going to make fun things and share them again, and I&#x2019;m going to use them to make this dark world as bright as I can. I hope you can find it in yourself to do the same.
