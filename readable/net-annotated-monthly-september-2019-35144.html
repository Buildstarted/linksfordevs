            <p>Ahhh, September. It’s such a great month that it’s been memorialized in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs069dndIYk">a popular song by Earth, Wind, and Fire</a>. In many places, school starts again and autumn will soon be upon us (for the north half of the world). As the weather becomes milder, it’s nice to sit outside and catch up on some technical reading. Besides, once the kids go back to school you can actually get some reading done.</p>
