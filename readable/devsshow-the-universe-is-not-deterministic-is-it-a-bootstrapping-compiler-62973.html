<p>Last night I started watching the HULU show Devs, starring Nick Offerman.</p>



<p>In the first episode, we learn that Nick’s character – Forest is building a quantum computing powered machine to model the universe to a great degree of fidelity.</p>



<figure><img src="https://arturpiszek.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/596ee6f9795f066c003cddce7738330b.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>In the scene pictured above, Forest is launching into a monologue that <b>Universe is deterministic</b>. If he indeed succeeded in building a working model of the universe with predictive powers, then indeed, his conclusion would be accurate. I haven’t watched the whole series, but I suppose we will learn more.</p>



<p>In a second episode, we hear that they have a problem with the „fidelity” part. Their modeling is crude, and one proposed explanation is that:</p>



<blockquote><p><span>modeling the universe may need an entire universe – one qubit per particle.</span></p></blockquote>



<h3>Why I don’t think this is possible</h3>



<p>What struck me as wrong in this statement is that even if we somehow get a universe-size quantum computer with each particle tracked, <b>the universe is made from more than particles.</b>
</p>



<p>In the model proposed in the series, we would model all of classical physics, but what about all the quantum soup?</p>



<p>What about the modeling machine itself and it’s interference? How do we model all those qubits?</p>



<p>The universe is a second-order chaotic system, which means that it reacts to predictions. This aspect is beaten to death in every pop-culture product featuring time travel, and implications are well-explored in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox">grandfather paradox</a>.</p>



<p>Another Science-Fiction cliche, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">Shroedinger’s Ca</a>t experiment presents problems with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics:</p>



<blockquote><p>The scenario presents a hypothetical cat that may be simultaneously both alive and dead,&nbsp;a state known as a quantum superposition, as a result of being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur.</p></blockquote>



<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation">The Copenhagen interpretation states</a>, that the „randomness” of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">uncertainty principle</a> collapses to a state on observation. Deterministic universe (and an ability to run a simulation) would require us to predict this collapse.</p>



<p>Modeling only particles, how can we predict that? And since we cannot discount non-particles from the simulation, the question is:</p>



<p><strong>Can the Universe be modeled using the tools we have in <span>this</span> universe?</strong></p>



<h3>Bootstrapping compilers</h3>



<p>Bootstrapping is a process of compiling a new programming language. The idea is to write a programming language (they are created as any other program – people write them) using<span> the language itself.</span> Then, a bootstrapping compiler will compile the kernel of the „real” compiler, and it will take it from there.</p>



<p>The bootstrapping compiler is written in a different language – a one that already has a compiler (or assembly language that does not need one).</p>



<p>So my question may be translated: Is the universe a bootstrapping compiler or does it need one?</p>



<h3>Living in a deterministic universe means no free will.</h3>



<p>Humans are meaning-making machines. When Elon Musk proposed, that we may live in a simulation, people felt a little taken aback. However, it does not really matter if we do – and <a href="https://singularityhub.com/2016/08/03/we-might-live-in-a-virtual-universe-but-it-doesnt-really-matter/">SingularityHub has a good explanation of why</a>.</p>



<p>We will never be able to access „the layer running the simulation”, so for intents and purposes – it does not matter, it’s purely theoretical.</p>



<p>That is also why we won’t be able to model THIS universe. We may be able to model A universe – in that sense, we are a bootstrapping compiler. We may be a model running in some other universe – a bootstrapping compiler for us.</p>



<p>The term „bootstrapping” came from the expression „pulling oneself by one’s bootstraps”:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Widely attributed to The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen, (1781) where the eponymous Baron pulls himself out of a swamp by his hair (specifically, his pigtail), though not by his bootstraps; misattribution dates to US, 1901</em></p><cite><em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pull_oneself_up_by_one's_bootstraps">Wiktionary</a></em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Bootstrapping itself is used as an example of a tall tale – something impossible and contradictory.</p>



<h3><strong>Even if it’s impossible, it will prompt us to learn more about reality</strong></h3>



<p>My coworkers and I had a chance to listen to a private keynote by <a href="https://piszek.com/2020/05/26/post-it/">Stephen Wolfram</a>. While explaining the story behind Mathematica, he shared a quote that stuck with me:</p>



<blockquote><p> <span>If we are building models, one of the things we could make the model of is the universe</span> </p><cite>Stephen Wolfram</cite></blockquote>
