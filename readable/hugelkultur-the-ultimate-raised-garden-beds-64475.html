</div>

<p>It's a german word and some people can say it all german-ish.  I'm an american doofus, so I say "hoogle culture".
I had to spend some time with google to find the right spelling.  Hugal, hoogal, huegal, hugel ....   And I really like saying it out loud:  "hugelkultur, hoogle culture, hoogal kulture ...."  - it could be a chant or something.  
</p>

<p>I learned this high-falootin word at 
my <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums">permaculture</a> training.  I also saw it demonstrated on the 
Sepp Holzer terraces and raised beds video - he didn't call it hugelkultur, but he was doing it.</p>

<p>Hugelkultur is nothing more than making raised garden beds filled with rotten wood.  This makes for raised garden beds loaded with
<a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/18.0" target="_blank">organic</a> material, nutrients, air pockets for the <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3498_0/permaculture/roots-tap-and-otherwise" target="_blank">roots</a> of what you plant, etc.  As the years pass, the deep <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/5056_0/permaculture/building-soil-faster-than-nature" target="_blank">soil</a> of your raised garden bed becomes incredibly rich and loaded with soil life.  As the wood shrinks, it makes more tiny air pockets - so your hugelkultur becomes sort of self tilling.  The first few years, the <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/2592_0/organic-sustainable-practices/composting" target="_blank">composting</a> process will slightly warm your soil giving you a slightly <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/2761_0/permaculture/season-extenders" target="_blank">longer growing season</a>.  The woody matter helps to keep nutrient excess from passing into the ground water - and then refeeding that to your garden plants later.  Plus, by holding SO much water, hugelkultur could be part of a system for <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3961_0/permaculture/urban-desert-permaculture" target="_blank">growing garden crops in the desert with no irrigation</a>.</p>

<p>I do think there are some considerations to keep in mind.  For example, I don't think I would use <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3961_0/permaculture/urban-desert-permaculture" target="_blank">cedar</a>.  Cedar lasts so
long because it is loaded with <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/6970_0/permaculture/the-myth-of-allelopathic-wood-chipswood-chips-made-from-cedars-will-kill-plants" target="_blank">natural pesticides/herbicides/anti-fungal/anti-microbial</a> (remember, good soil has lots of fungal and microbial stuff).  Not a good mix for <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3904_0/permaculture/grow-tomatoes-without-irrigation-or-fertilizer" target="_blank">tomatoes</a> or melons, eh?  Black locust, black cherry,
black walnut?  These woods have issues.  <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/224_0/woodland-care/what-makes-black-locust-last-so-long-is-it-safe-for-gardens" target="_blank">Black locust</a> won't rot - I think because it is so dense.  <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/1249_0/organic-sustainable-practices/juglone-planting-under-walnuts" target="_blank">Black walnut</a> is very toxic to most plants, and <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/8771_0/organic-sustainable-practices/the-best-cherry-varieties">cherry</a> is toxic to animals, but it might be okay when it rots - but I wouldn't use it until I had done the research.  Known excellent woods are: <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/5978_0/woodland-care/the-value-of-alder-alnus-glutinosa" target="_blank">alders</a>, <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/998_0/permaculture/growing-apples-from-seeds-vs-cloning" target="_blank">apple</a>, <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3603_0/woodland-care/about-cottonwood-trees">cottonwood</a>, <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/2497_0/woodland-care/poplar-good-for-what">poplar</a>, willow (dry) and birch.  I suspect maples would be really good too, but am not certain.  Super rotten wood is better than slightly aged wood.  The best woods are even better when they have been cut the same day (this allows you to "seed" the wood with your choice of fungus - shitake mushrooms perhaps?).</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that wood is high in carbon and will consume nitrogen to do the compost thing.
This could lock up the nitrogen and take it away from your growies.  But well rotted wood doesn't do this so much.  If
the wood is far enough along, it may have already taken in sooooo much nitrogen, that it is now putting it out!</p>

<p>Pine and fir will have some levels of tanins in them, but I'm guessing that most of that will be gone when the wood has
been dead for a few years.</p>

<p>In the drawings at right, the artist is trying to show that while the wood decomposes and shrinks, the leaves, duff and accumulating organic matter from above will take it's place.  The artist is showing the new organic matter as a dark green.</p>

</div>

<p>I find I most often build hugelkultur in places where the soil is shallow.  So I end up finding excess soil from somewhere else on the property and piling it on some logs.  Presto!  Instant raised garden beds!  This is usually the easiest/fastest way too.  Especially if you have earth moving equipment.</p>

<p>For those times that the soil is deep and you are moving the soil by hand, I like to dig up the sod and dig down a foot or two.  Then pile in the wood.  Then put the sod on top of the wood, upside-down.  Then pile the topsoil on top of that.  Even better is to figure out where the paths will be, and dig down there too.  Add two layers of sod onto the logs and then the double topsoil.</p>

<p>I have discovered that a lot of people are uncomfortable with the idea of raised bed gardens.  They have seen the large flat gardens for years and are sure this is the way to do it.  Some people are okay with raised beds that are three to six inches tall - they consider anything taller than that unsightly.  </p>

<p>So this is gonna sound crazy, but I hope to convince you that the crazy-sounding stuff is worth it.</p>

<p>If you build your hugelkultur raised garden beds tall enough, you won't have to irrigate.  At all (after the second year).  No hoses.  No drip system.  Anything shorter won't require as much irrigation - so there is still some benefit. Imagine going on vacation in the summer without having to hire somebody to <s>kill</s> water your garden! As a further bonus, the flavor of everything you grow will be far better!</p>

<p>To go all summer long without a drop of rain, you need to build your hugelkultur raised bed gardens .... six feet tall.  But they'll shrink!  Mostly in the first month.  Which is why I suggest you actually build them seven feet tall.</p>

<p>Hugelkultur raised garden beds can be built just two feet tall and will hold moisture for about three weeks.  Not quite as good, but more within the comfort zone of many people - including urban neighbors.</p>

<p>Some people will start out with hugelkultur raised garden beds that are two and a half feet tall and plant only annuals.  And each year they will build the size of the bed a foot.  So that after a few years, they will have the bigger beds and the neighbors never really noticed.  And if they've tasted what comes from it - they might be all for it without caring about the big mounds.</p>

<p>Besides, isn't this much better use of the wood than hauling it to the dump, or chipping it, or putting it in those big city bins for yard waste?</p>

<h2 id="comparison">different kinds of hugel beds</h2>
</header>

<content>

<p>I usually build hugelkulture raised garden beds about five feet wide.  This makes for some mighty steep beds.  Just pack that soil on tight and plant it with a mix of heavy rooted plants to hold it all together.  Quick! Before it rains!  If you are going to build beds shorter than three feet tall, I suggest that you make the beds no wider than four feet wide.  Unless you are doing  <a href="https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/6518_0/permaculture/starting-a-key-hole-garden" target="_blank">keyhole style raised garden beds</a>, in which case you should be able to get away with something wider.</p>

	<p>This DVD is part of a 3 DVD set called World Domination Gardening. In this DVD we talk about hugelkultur and terraces. This location gets frost in the winter and can be really hot in the summer. A lot of the surrounding area looks very desert like. We decide to make a hugelkultur bed shaped into a sun scoop. And the angle of the slope is optimized to the level of the sun in winter. We also talk about how swales are excellent at creating frost pockets which works to your advantage in the summer. What type of wood and different variations for hugelkultur are covered. A terrace is constructed to hold the hugelkultur bed.</p>

<p>The hugelkultur raised garden beds below were built in an urban lot between the curb and the sidewalk (sometimes called a parking strip).  The final raised garden bed is about two feet tall.  The beds are about six feet wide with keyholes.  There is rotted maple on the inside and black locust (will rot in about 70 years) on the outside:</p>

<h2 id="FAQ">hugelkultur raised beds FAQ</h2>
</header>

<content>

<p><b>My HOA won't allow anything like that, what do I do?  (my neighbors would freak out, what do I do?)</b>
</p>

<p>There are many possibilities.  Some people dig a trench five feet deep, fill that with organic matter and have something that is either flush with the surface or it appears to be only one foot tall (which is in the comfort zone of neighbors and HOA folk).  Other people will build something that is 18 inches high the first year, and add a foot each year.  Still others will have so many neighbors build them all at once that it is difficult the buck the tide.  And then there is always the back yard.</p>

<p><b>I have standing trees that are about to be cut down.  I don't want to have a bunch of logs sitting around until they are old to be used for raised garden beds.  What do I do?</b></p>

<p>The wood doesn't have to be old to be used. In fact, it is even better when fresh!</p>

<p><b>Do I need a wood chipper/shredder?</b></p>

<p>No.  This style of raised garden beds works much better if the wood is not chipped.  So much more peaceful and less smelly too!</p>

<p><b>How do I till it every spring?</b></p>

<p>Once the raised garden bed is built, you don't ever till it.  As the wood breaks down inside the bed, it will sorta-kinda till its insides itself.  And with a really tall, really steep raised garden bed, nobody will step on it, so the soil will not become compacted.</p>

<p><b>I'm 81 years old. Does this make gardening less work?</b></p>

<p>More work to set up.  But less work as the years pass.  Planting and harvesting should be easier since you won't have to bend down as much.  On the second year and beyond, all irrigation and fertilization will be eliminated - so that's less work.  When combined with permaculture and polyculture techniques, you can even eliminate planting seeds, so that in the end, all you ever do is harvest.</p>

<p><b>What will this do to the flavor of the food?</b></p>

<p>It will make for stronger flavor.  Especially for fruits.  Expect far more flavor in tomatoes and berries.</p>

	<p>So I guess a person could think of the wood used in hugelkultur as "wild compost"!  Available in twig, stick and log
sizes!</p>

<p>So I popped on out to my local hugelkultur store and I saw this:</p>

<p>Yummy!  I'm guessing that somebody did some thinning and stacked this to use for firewood in the future.  Only they
never came back and got it.  So the years passed and the wood rotted ...</p>

<p>I took most of it and put it on my tractor:</p>

<p>I left stuff that was so rotten that it would not transport well.  Besides, it's going to do some good for the forest if
not for my raised beds.</p>

<p>Instant raised bed!  Just lay down wood, and cover with dirt!  That's all there is to it!  Just two easy steps!</p>

<p>That's a hurky big bed!  It will probabably be about 1/3 the size a year from now.  Then we'll place rocks around it and
rework it a little into a slightly more elegant raised bed.  This year:  potatoes!</p>

		<h2 id="micro-doc">micro Documentary on hugelkultur for gardeners</h2>
	</header>
	<content>
		<p>Bart and I created a micro documentary for all of the supporters. It is animation rich, and a very polished, professional creation. Topics covered include:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> How to shape your landscape to be warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.
		</li><li>Encouraging diversity inside the hugelkultur as well as outside.
		</li><li>Organic vs. Permaculture 
		</li></ul>
		
		<p>While the full 3-DVD set is for urban gardeners as well as people with acreage, and the full 3-DVD set will contain far more information on hugelkultur, this micro documentary will be focused on gardening and have no focus on projects with larger acreage.</p>
