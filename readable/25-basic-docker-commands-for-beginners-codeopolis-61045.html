<p>If youâ€™re trying to learn <a href="http://docker.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker</a> you will first have to master its various terminal commands.  This guide aims to help you get started with basic docker commands.  </p>



<p>This tutorial assumes that you already have Docker installed on your system.  If not, you can start <a href="https://codeopolis.com/posts/quick-and-easy-steps-to-install-docker/">here</a> to learn how to quickly install Docker.  Select a topic from the table of contents below.  </p>



<h2><span id="Working_with_Docker_Containers"></span>Working with Docker Containers<span></span></h2>



<p>The below commands are docker commands that can be used when working with containers.  Below you will learn how to create, remove, start and stop containers.  </p>



<h3 id="CreateContainer"><span id="Creating_a_Container"></span>Creating a Container<span></span></h3>



<p>To create a simple container, use the below command and replace <code>[IMAGE_NAME]</code> with the name of the image you want to run. When you hit the&nbsp;<code>enter</code> key, Docker will search the <a href="http://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker Hub</a> for that image, download it to your system and create a stopped container.</p>







<h3 id="RunContainer"><span id="Creating_and_Running_a_Container"></span>Creating and Running a Container<span></span></h3>



<p>To create <em>and</em> run a container, use this command.  As with before, replace <code>[IMAGE_NAME]</code> with the name of the image that you want to run.  This command will search the Docker Hub for the image that you specified, download it, create a container and start that container.</p>







<h3 id="StartContainer"><span id="Starting_a_Stopped_Container"></span>Starting a Stopped Container<span></span></h3>



<p>To start a container on your system that is stopped, you can run the following command.  Replace <code>[CONTAINER_NAME]</code> with the name <em>or</em> ID of the stopped container on your system that you would like to start.  </p>







<h3 id="StopContainer"><span id="Stopping_a_Running_Container"></span>Stopping a Running Container<span></span></h3>



<p>Use this command to stop a container on your system that is running.  Once the container is stopped you can start it later by running the <a href="#StartContainer">start command</a>.  Replace <code>[CONTAINER_NAME]</code> with the name <em>or</em> ID of your running container.</p>







<h3 id="Restart"><span id="Restarting_a_Running_Container"></span>Restarting a Running Container<span></span></h3>



<p>Occasionally you may need to restart a running container to give it a fresh start.  Just replace <code>[CONTAINER_NAME]</code> with the name <em>or</em> ID of the container you would like to restart. </p>







<h3 id="Pause"><span id="Pausing_a_Running_Container"></span>Pausing a Running Container<span></span></h3>



<p>If you need to pause the process within a running container temporarily, run the following command after replacing <code>[CONTAINER_NAME]</code> with the name <em>or</em> ID of the container that you would like to pause.</p>







<h3 id="Resume"><span id="Resuming_a_Paused_Container"></span>Resuming a Paused Container<span></span></h3>



<p>After pausing a container, you can resume a paused container by using the below command.  Replace <code>[CONTAINER_NAME]</code> with the name <em>or </em>ID of the container that you need to resume. </p>







<h3 id="ContainerLS"><span id="List_Running_Containers"></span>List Running Containers<span></span></h3>



<p>If you need to view a list of running containers on your system, run the below command.</p>







<p>or</p>







<h3 id="RemoveContainer"><span id="Removing_a_Container"></span>Removing a Container<span></span></h3>



<p>In order to delete a container from your system you can run the following command.  Replace <code>[CONTAINER_NAME]</code> with the name <em>or </em>ID of the container that you would like to delete.</p>

<h2 id="Images"><span id="Working_with_Docker_Container_Images"></span>Working with Docker Container Images<span></span></h2>



<p>Docker container images are files that contain the operating system, application and initial state of a docker container.  They can be built from Dockerfiles or created from containers that you already have running.  The following docker commands will help you get started working with container images.</p>



<h3 id="Build"><span id="Building_an_Image_from_a_Dockerfile"></span>Building an Image from a Dockerfile<span></span></h3>



<p>A <a href="https://thenewstack.io/docker-basics-how-to-use-dockerfiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dockerfile</a> is a list of commands that docker uses to create and build a container image.  You can build an image from a dockerfile by running the below command.  Repace <code>[DOCKERFILE_PATH]</code> with the URL to the dockerfile you would like to build from.</p>







<h3 id="Commit"><span id="Building_an_Image_from_a_Container"></span>Building an Image from a Container<span></span></h3>



<p>You can also build an image from a running container.  This is a quick to take a backup snapshot of a container that you are working with.  Replace <code>[CONTAINER_NAME]</code> with the name of the container that you would like to create an image from.  Replace <code>[IMAGE_NAME]</code> with the image name you would like to use for the newly created image.</p>







<h3 id="Pull"><span id="Pulling_an_Image_from_the_Docker_Hub"></span>Pulling an Image from the Docker Hub<span></span></h3>



<p>Use the below command to download an image from the Docker Hub to your system.  Replace <code>[IMAGE_NAME]</code> with the name of the image used on the hub.</p>







<h3 id="Push"><span id="Pushing_an_Image_to_the_Docker_Hub"></span>Pushing an Image to the Docker Hub<span></span></h3>



<p>Before you push a container image to the docker hub, you must <a href="https://hub.docker.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create an account</a> at the docker hub and login from your terminal.  Once you have your account ready, run the following command in your terminal:</p>







<p>You will then be asked for your docker hub username and password.  Once you are logged in, you can push an image to the hub by using the following command.  Replace <code>[IMAGE_NAME]</code> with the name of the image that you would like to push.</p>







<h3 id="ImageLS"><span id="List_Container_Images"></span>List Container Images<span></span></h3>



<p>If you need to view a list of images on your system, run the following command:</p>
