</p><div id="" class="">He went on to <a href="https://jaxenter.com/microsoft-ready-contribute-openjdk-163550.html">reaffirm Microsoft's commitment to Java</a> and that the team is looking forward to giving something back to the Java community. However, the team will not just barge in with a heavy hand, but will start with smaller bug fixes and the like so they can learn how to be "good citizens within OpenJDK."   <p>Borges, himself a former Oracle developer, is Principal Product Manager for Java at Microsoft. He presents Martijn Verburg as the Java engineering team lead who will be working together along with other partners in the Java ecosystem.  Verburg is also CEO of jClarity, a <a href="https://jaxenter.com/adoptopenjdk-contributor-jclarity-acquired-microsoft-161112.html">leading AdoptOpenJDK contributor acquired by Microsoft</a> in August this year, so presumably he will stay true to form and continue to contribute to the Java world, only now with Microsoft at his back... </p><p>Microsoft's acquisition of jClarity was just the latest in their efforts to gain a foothold in the Java community. There are many Java developers and Java champions who now practice their trade under Microsoft's banner... At JAX London a few weeks ago, Program Chair Sebastian Meyen opened the conference by giving a speech in which he said "Microsoft is now a Java shop". He sees this as a great development, as "it's always good when industry giants stand behind Java."</p></div></div></div></div>
