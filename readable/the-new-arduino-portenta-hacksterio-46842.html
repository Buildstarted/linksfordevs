<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p><span>Announced today at </span><a href="https://ces.tech/" rel="nofollow">CES</a><span> is the Arduino </span><a href="http://arduino.cc/pro" rel="nofollow">Portenta H7 </a><span>module. Despite visual similarities to their other MKR form factor boards, and putting aside the lack of classic Arduino blue color, this new board isn’t really like other Arduinos. Designed for industry, not makers, the new Portenta is rather different.</span></p><p>The first Arduino boards were arrived back in what seems almost like pre-history now, all the way back in 2005, but it wasn’t until the introduction of the Arduino Uno, which didn’t come along until 2010, that the boards really become one of the pillars of the maker movement.</p><p><span>However, a lot has changed over the course of the last decade. Distracted as they were by their </span><a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/07/28/arduino-vs-arduino-musto-out-banzi-in/" rel="nofollow">legal troubles,</a><span> many would argue that Arduino lost track of the things that made them successful.</span></p><p><span>The plummeting price of hardware, which led to the </span><a href="https://medium.com/@aallan/capable-computing-50867847a8d8" rel="nofollow">capable computing </a><span>movement, computing that is “</span><em>good enough,</em><span>” as well as the arrival of boards running MicroPython and JavaScript, </span><a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/06/26/the-next-generation-of-high-powered-microcontrollers/" rel="nofollow">changed the hardware landscape </a><span>rather profoundly, and Arduino didn’t seem to adapt. Or at least, not quickly enough.</span></p><p><span>But over the last year (or two) things have started changing a lot more quickly. While the classic Arduino form factor may be </span><a href="https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/11/05/welcoming-new-humble-masterpieces-into-momas-collection/" rel="nofollow">iconic,</a><span> it </span><a href="https://blog.hackster.io/introducing-two-new-boards-from-arduino-f4654b7bd0ec" rel="nofollow">is also dying.</a><span> The ‘legacy’ Uno form factor is </span><a href="https://blog.hackster.io/introducing-the-arduino-uno-wifi-7118f428ad39" rel="nofollow">still around,</a><span> and it’s likely to stick around for more than a few more years yet, but increasingly newer boards from Arduino use the more modern </span><a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino/arduino-mkr-family" rel="nofollow">MKR form factor,</a><span> while the </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/introducing-four-new-arduino-nanos-869b8abbccb4" rel="nofollow">return of the Arduino Nano </a><span>has allowed the company to remain competative at the cheaper end of the market.</span></p><p>Other changes have been a bit more subtle than new hardware, but in a way, far more significant, and may be indicating a change of direction for the entire company.</p><div><div><p><span>The Arduino Portenta H7 module.

However these days, it is showing its age. So perhaps the biggest amongst the indicators was the </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/arduino-pro-development-environment-announced-at-maker-faire-rome-06da6ab01e32" rel="nofollow">arrival of the Arduino Pro Development Environment,</a><span> announced at the tail end of last year at Maker Faire Rome. A step down a path by Arduino towards support for small manufacturers rather than its core maker audience.</span></p><p><span>The Arduino team has also made “…</span><em>a range of Arduino reference design assets, from validated component symbols and footprints to schematic and layout templates”</em><span> available in Altium Designer to shorten times between prototyping and production.</span></p><div><div><p><span>The new Portenta and carrier board. (📷: Alasdair Allan)</span></p></div></div><p><span>The new Portenta module is the first product in what will be a new family of boards. It is built around an STMicroelectronics </span><a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32h747-757.html" rel="nofollow">STM32H747</a><span> with a dual-core Arm Cortex-M7 and a Cortex-M4 on chip, running at 480MHz and 240MHz, respectively. Designed and rated for industrial applications, it can operate in temperatures between -40° and 85°C.</span></p><div><div><p><span>1 / 2</span> • <span>The new Portenta with a camera board.
