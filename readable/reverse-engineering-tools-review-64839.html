   <p itemprop="description">Review of reverse engineering (i.e. software reversing) tools. Advantages and disadvantages, alternative solutions.</p>

   <p>Reverse engineering or <a href="https://www.pelock.com/services/reverse-engineering" title="Reverse Engineering Services">software reversing</a>, is a set of techniques use to analyze closed source software in order to extract seemingly unavailable information, e.g. algorithms, hidden access passwords (e.g. to databases), information on how certain files are encrypted, and so on.</p>

   <p>Reverse engineering is used for example in the fields of software analysis for potential security vulnerabilities (exploitation), malware analysis (antivirus developers) or <a href="https://www.pelock.com/services/software-and-games-localization" title="Software and Games Localization">software and games localization</a>.</p>

   <p>Advanced software analysis requires the knowledge of examined files structure, so most often a knowledge of executable files formats is required, <em><a href="https://www.secnews.pl/2014/12/24/portable-executable-poster/">Portable Executable</a></em> for Windows system or <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" title="Executable and Linkable Format" rel="nofollow">ELF</a></em> format for Linux type systems. It is also required to know <a href="https://www.pelock.com/articles/when-and-how-to-use-an-assembler-assembly-programming-basics" title="When and how to use an assembler. Assembly programming basics.">basis of assembler</a> for 32 and 64 bit platforms, in order to understand properly compiled code in closed-source software, its structure and widely used conceptions and software constructions transformed into binary data.</p>

   <p>Even having appropriate knowledge, we will not be able to use it without proper tools. In this article, I'd like to present dedicated tools, used in reverse engineering, divided into categories. The majority of the dedicated tools, divided into categories presented here, qualify as a material for separate articles; however, it was my idea to present as many types of software as possible to show a variety of uses.</p>

   <p>Complicated character of reverse engineering software and the process of its creation is often connected with the fact that those programs are also expensive, but I tried to present alternative solutions and free equivalents of presented examples.</p>

   <p>There is a wide variety of both programming languages and compilers. Apart from applications created in script languages, we can differentiate applications compiled to the processor's native code. Apart from that, there is a number of methods of protecting applications and their resources, and all of that affects the final result of binary file image on disk.</p>

   <p>If we are not sure what the software that we are looking at was created with, as we have no expertise in distinguishing characteristic features in compiled files (section names, imported libraries, etc.), using identification (or detectors), tools that have signature base of popular compilers, program and cryptographic libraries or application security systems, is worth trying.

A quick analysis will let us decide what our next step should be (e.g. unpacking the application)</p>

   <p>With knowledge about what we are dealing with or, to be precise, what programming language and compiler this application was created with, we begin analysis in disassembler or decompiler. It is their task to analyze compiled, binary file and display its code and structure in a way easy for a human to understand.</p>

   <p>Thanks to the process of disassembling and decompiling we will know all the functions of the application, what text strings are inside and what fragments of code references to them, what outside functions of the operating system are used by the application or which functions are exported (e.g. in the case of <em>DLL</em> dynamic libraries).</p>

   <p>Disassemblers job is to depict application's code in the for of low-level assembler, so if analyzed software was written in C++, Delphi, Visual Basic or any other high-level language compiled to native code, the disassembler will show us its object code in the form of x86 or x64 assembler code.</p>

   <p>Decompilers are able or try really hard to recreate original high level code from the code of compiled applications. As you can guess, recreating a high level language code, e.g. <em>C++</em> with recognition of data structures, types and construction of programming language from compiled code of assembler is a very complicated process, so the amount of tools that allow such action is very small and if they are good, they are in the same time very expensive.</p>

   <p>Decompilers can be divided basing on categories of software that they are able to analyze. Compilers of languages like e.g. C# (.NET Framework family), Visual Basic, Java generate object code in the intermediate form, meaning that this code is not directly executed by processor like x86 code, it is a pseudo code (so called <em>P-Code</em>), that is executed by a virtual machine of those programming systems (to run we need e.g. .NET Framework or JVM installed).</p>

   <p>Such output code, because of its simplicity and most information stored in the form of pseudo instructions and metadata, resulted in the fact that decompiling in such cases is much more simple than decompiling x86 or x64 code. This caused creation of many dedicated decompilers, that became a nightmare of programmers writing in those languages, as it was very easy for anyone to take a peek at unprotected software, practically it's the version with source code wide open.</p>

   <p>That was short introduction, now it is time for a list of most popular disassemblers and decompilers and their usage examples.</p>

   <p>When you must face analysis of software created in a programming language based on .NET Framework, e.g. C# or VB#, <em>.NET Reflector</em> decompiler will prove invaluable help. With its help, you will be able to quickly and efficiently take a peek at application's structure and code.</p>

   <p><em>Reflector's</em> big advantage is the fact that it has a small but very useful plugin base, with available, for example a plugin that allows recreating of the whole project for Visual Studio, from decompiled application. In addition, integration with Microsoft Visual Studio allows for simultaneous debugging of own code and code of closed libraries.</p>

   <p>Because of simplicity of decompiling programs created for .NET Framework, many security tools were created, of course we are talking here about obfuscators that remove meta data from compiled programs, are able to modify <em>IL</em> code, encrypt text strings etc. If we come across such a program, we should familiarize ourselves with <em><a href="https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot" rel="nofollow">de4dot</a></em> deobfuscator, that is able to automatically remove protections used by dozens of obfuscator types.</p>

   <p><em>JD-GUI</em> or <em>Java Decompiler</em> is a decompiler for Java applications, hence its name. It allows for viewing of compiled units code<em>*.class</em> or whole <em>*.jar</em> bundles.</p>

   <p>It contains very useful search engine with filters that allow for searching by names, types, constructors, fields, methods and text strings.</p>

   <p>Apart from stand alone application there are also plugins for programming environment <em><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" rel="nofollow">IntelliJ IDEA</a></em>, that allow for viewing code of compiled modules.</p>

   <p>If you've ever used or you keep using well-known decompiler <em>JAD</em> (that was discontinued in 2001) then it's about time for an update, not only does <em>JD-GUI</em> support new elements of Java language, but also navigation over decompiled project is very easy and fun.</p>

   <p>It also needs to be mentioned that, just like with .NET applications, that have been protected with obfuscators, Java applications can be protected and then decompiler functioning is limited or even impossible.</p>

   <p>Applications created with Visual Basic 5 and 6 are all in the past now.

   <h2 id="debuggers"><a href="#debuggers" aria-label="Anchor link for: debuggers" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>Debuggers</h2>

   <p>Every programmer sooner or later gets to know the functioning of a debugger in his favourite programming environment. Thanks to debugger we are able to track application running in real time, see how instructions affect contents of memory or variables and detect potential errors. However debugging of our own software, when we have access to information about source code and usually debug high-level code, straight from programming environment, is a piece of cake compared to debugging of application without access to source code. This is where dedicated debuggers, with advanced analysis of binary application structures, come in handy, but their use requires knowledge of low-level languages as well as basis of functioning of processor, for which this application was compiled.</p>

   <h3 id="ollydbg"><a href="#ollydbg" aria-label="Anchor link for: ollydbg" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>OllyDbg</h3>

   <p>This is de facto a standard debugger for Windows in the world of reverse engineering (alongside built-in debugger for <em>IDA</em> disassembler). It has capabilities of application code analysis and allows for interference with almost every aspect of application running.</p>

   <p>Other interesting functions include <em>OllyDbg</em> that allows for conditional code tracing, has vast plugins database, including those hiding its presence from anti-debug methods (<em>Phant0m</em> plugin), or plugins that allow for controlling of debugger running from the script level (<em>ODbgScript</em> plugin), while those scripts, most often used for unpacking of unprotected applications, come in hundreds.</p>

   <p>Popularity of <em>OllyDbg</em> is obvious with the fact, that no other debugger, including legendary <em>SoftICE</em> system debugger has had so many plugins and modified versions like <em>OllyDbg</em>. It is interesting that a special version <em>OllyDbg</em> was created under the name of <em>Immunity Debugger</em> with built-in Python script support, meant for analyzing malware and creating exploits</p>

   <p>There are currently two versions of OllyDbg, old with number 1.10, that has the most extensions and new version 2.01 that is becoming more and more popular. It is good news that a new 64-bit version is being developed because of the popularity of 64-bit operating systems.</p>

   <p>x64dbg are basically two debuggers, one dedicated for 64 bit software debugging and second for 32 bit applications. It features
   modern interface, plenty of configuration options, internal engine based on modern programming libraries like

   <p>Number of supported features is really impressing, plugins, built-in scripting language, Yara signatures scanning, built-in decompiler and many more.
   And it's development is very active. Taking the fact that 64 bit OllyDbg never left the development stage, x64dbg has become de facto
   standard debugger for 64 bit applications.</p>

   <h2 id="hex-editors"><a href="#hex-editors" aria-label="Anchor link for: hex editors" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>Hex editors</h2>

   <p>If you have analyzed your application in disassembler, traced its running in debugger, there may be a need to interfere with program code in order to input corrections or to change some text strings, fix values or other information included in application's binary file.</p>

   <p>For that purpose hex editors are used. At times when I used to read games magazine <a href="http://www.topsecretfan.com/" rel="nofollow">Top Secret</a>, I associated hex editors only with save games modification, as readers were sending numerous <em>offsets</em> (addresses in a file) as well as values that needed to be changed in save files, e.g. to get a certain amount of cash or other resources in the game.</p>

   <p>There are many hex editors on the market, with numerous different functions and applications, like e.g. built-in view over data structure (meaning that this hex editor can visually display for example bitmap elements or internal structure of exe file). An example of such an editor is e.g. well known <em>WinHex</em>, that is used in data retrieval (it contains built-in support for many system files), however, in my opinion, it is not very good for works connected with 'digging' in application's binary files, despite the fact that it has appropriate functions.</p>

   <h3 id="hiew"><a href="#hiew" aria-label="Anchor link for: hiew" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>HIEW</h3>

   <p>This is my number one for hex editors, I cannot imagine my work without it. It is seemingly an old console application, but in reality it is a true beast. <em>HIEW</em> (by <em>Hacker’s View</em>) is a hexeditor, disassembler that supports architecture of x86, x64, ARM V6 processors, it also supports <em>NE</em>, <em>LE</em>, <em>PE/PE32+</em>, <em>ELF/ELF64</em> files. This program has vast user database has been developed since 1991 and updates are regular.</p>

   <p>Thanks to <em>HIEW</em>, we are able not only to edit binary file data but if that is an application, also its code. Built-in disassembler allows for navigation over the code and its functions as well as to easily modify existing instructions with the help of built-in assembler, which means that you don't have to know hex codes by heart. Instead, it is enough to write e.g. <code>mov eax,edx</code> and <em>HIEW</em> will automatically compile that instruction and insert it into binary file.</p>

   <p><em>HIEW</em> is also able to repeatedly replace tools like <em>IDA</em>, if we have a simple task to do, its greatest advantages are its ability to operate very fast and built-in code analysis and direct modification options.</p>

   <h2 id="resource-editors"><a href="#resource-editors" aria-label="Anchor link for: resource editors" data-anchorjs-icon=""></a>Resource editors</h2>

   <p>Characteristic feature of Windows applications is the fact all resources like icons, images, forms, localized texts, as well as other information, can be saved in <em>PE</em> file structure, within a special area called resources. Those data are saved when linking. As all application files are saved in one <em>EXE</em> or <em>DLL</em> output file, if there is a need to change those information and if their size is unchanged, we will be able to modify them using hex editor, however, if we need to add new data or set different that have a larger size (e.g. longer text or another image), because of the structure of those data we will have to use proper resource editor.</p>

   <p>Apart from modifications in application's resources, resource editors are also used just for taking a peek what additional data are stored in the application's file.</p>
