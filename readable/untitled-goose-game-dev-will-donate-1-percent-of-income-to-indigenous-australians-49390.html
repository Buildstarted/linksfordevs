                                                             <div><p>Australian developer House House has pledged to donate at least 1 percent of its income to the nation's Indigenous groups as part of the 'Pay the Rent' initiative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The studio, which recently launched <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/356224/Untitled_Goose_Game_has_topped_1_million_sales_in_three_months.php">hugely popular puzzler <em>Untitled Goose Game</em>,</a> said its video games are currently being made on stolen Wurundjeri land, and that it intends to acknowledge that fact by handing over a portion of its earnings to the original residents.</p>

<p>"We at House House will be paying at least 1 percent of our income to Indigenous groups, in perpetuity, as part of the Pay the Rent movement. We'd encourage others to do the same," wrote the company on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As a start, we're giving to the Wurundjeri Tribe Council, Warriors of Aboriginal Resistance, and Seedmob. If you're a settler living and working on Aboriginal land, like we are, please consider paying the rent."</p>

<p>Pay the Rent asks that non-Aboriginal Australians give back some&nbsp;of the wealth they gained from the invasion and appropriation of Indigenous land to help "traditional land owners in their struggle for self-determination and economic independence."</p>

<p>"Today Pay the Rent is a reasonable, rational, and responsible way of ensuring the survival of the oldest living culture in the world," reads an explainer on the <a href="https://www.invasionday.org/pay-the-rent-campaigns">Pay the Rent website</a>. "It is a significant con tribulation to the process of Reconciliation, and embracing its philosophy is a sign of growing maturity among today's 'Australians.'"&nbsp;</p>

<p>Considering&nbsp;<em>Untitled Goose Game</em> recently surpassed 1 million sales in just three months, House House's income pledge could amount to a serious lump of cash if the game continues to sell well.</p></div>
