<p>The <b>ST3000DM001</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive" title="Hard disk drive">hard disk drive</a> released by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagate_Technology" title="Seagate Technology">Seagate Technology</a> in 2011 as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagate_Barracuda" title="Seagate Barracuda">Seagate Barracuda</a> series. It has a capacity of 3 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte" title="Terabyte">terabytes</a> (TB) and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeds_and_feeds#Spindle_speed" title="Speeds and feeds">spindle speed</a> of 7200&nbsp;rpm. This particular drive model was reported to have unusually high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_failure" title="Hard disk drive failure">failure</a> rates.

<p>The ST3000DM001 uses three 1&nbsp;TB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_platter" title="Hard disk drive platter">platters</a>, compared to five platters in the previous generation Barracuda XT drive, and has a spindle speed of 7200&nbsp;rpm. The drive uses a 40&nbsp;nm dual-core <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSI_Corporation" title="LSI Corporation">LSI</a> controller and 64&nbsp;MB of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR2_SDRAM" title="DDR2 SDRAM">DDR2</a>-800 as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRAM" title="DRAM">DRAM</a> cache. As part of the release of its 1&nbsp;TB-platter drives, Seagate announced that it was phasing out its Barracuda Green line of 5900&nbsp;rpm hard drives.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_Lal_Shimpi" title="Anand Lal Shimpi">Anand Lal Shimpi</a> of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AnandTech" title="AnandTech">AnandTech</a></i> noted that the ST3000DM001 is "a bit faster in sequential performance than the old Barracuda XT, at lower power consumption" and that "Seagate appears to have optimized the drive's behavior for lower power rather than peak performance". He said he was "personally ok" with the lower performance under heavy loads as long as the drive is used together with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" title="Solid-state drive">solid-state drive</a> (SSD) in a system.<sup id="cite_ref-anand_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-anand-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backblaze" title="Backblaze">Backblaze</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_backup_service" title="Remote backup service">remote backup service</a> company, observed that its ST3000DM001 drives have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_failure" title="Hard disk drive failure">failed</a> at rates far higher than the average of other hard drives.<sup id="cite_ref-extremetech-failure_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-extremetech-failure-2">[2]</a></sup> Only 251 of the 4,190 ST3000DM001 hard drives placed in service in 2012 were still in service as of 31&nbsp;March 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-backblaze_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-backblaze-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>According to Backblaze, the company switched to Seagate 3&nbsp;TB hard drives after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Thailand_floods" title="2011 Thailand floods">2011 Thailand floods</a> disrupted the supply of hard drives and increased their prices by 200–300%. Backblaze, which normally used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HGST" title="HGST">HGST</a> 3&nbsp;TB hard drives, were only able to find Seagate 3&nbsp;TB drives in "decent quantity". Backblaze noted that the failure rates of the ST3000DM001 did not follow a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathtub_curve" title="Bathtub curve">bathtub curve</a> typically followed by hard disk drive failure rates, instead having 2.7% failing in 2012, 5.4% failing in 2013, and 47.2% failing in 2014. Other 3&nbsp;TB hard drives that Backblaze placed in service in 2012, which were operated in a similar environment as the Seagate drives, did not show signs of increased failure.<sup id="cite_ref-backblaze_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-backblaze-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>Joel Hruska of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExtremeTech" title="ExtremeTech">ExtremeTech</a> noted that Backblaze was unable to explain the high failure rates of the ST3000DM001 compared to other products. Hruska pointed out that Seagate cut the warranty for these drives, along with most other hard disk drive manufacturers, from three years to one year in 2012. Hruska provided supplier-change or part substitution, shipping of substandard hardware to increase profits, and Backblaze's use of consumer hard drives in an enterprise environment as possible explanations.<sup id="cite_ref-extremetech-failure_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-extremetech-failure-2">[2]</a></sup> Paul Alcorn of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%27s_Hardware" title="Tom's Hardware">Tom's Hardware</a> pointed out that of the 3&nbsp;TB hard disk drive models that were in service with Backblaze, the ST3000DM001 was the only drive without a rotational vibration sensor that counteracts excessive vibration in heavy-usage cases.<sup id="cite_ref-tom's_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-tom's-4">[4]</a></sup>

<p>In 2016, Seagate faced a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action" title="Class action">class action</a> over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_failure" title="Hard disk drive failure">failure rates</a> of its ST3000DM001 3&nbsp;TB drives.<sup id="cite_ref-tom's_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-tom's-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-pcworld_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-pcworld-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-digital_trends_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-digital_trends-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-techreport_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-techreport-7">[7]</a></sup> Law firm Hagens Berman filed the lawsuit on 1&nbsp;February in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Northern_District_of_California" title="United States District Court for the Northern District of California">United States District Court for the Northern District of California</a>, and primarily cited reliability data provided by Backblaze. The lawsuit also pointed to user reviews of the hard disk drive on Newegg, which totaled more than 700 reviews with 2 or fewer stars.<sup id="cite_ref-pcworld_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-pcworld-5">[5]</a></sup> 
</p><p>The lawsuit lists Christopher Nelson, who purchased a Seagate Backup Plus 3&nbsp;TB drive and a Seagate Barracuda 3&nbsp;TB hard disk drive in October 2011, as its plaintiff. Both products subsequently failed, and the lawsuit contended that Seagate replaced them with inherently faulty products.<sup id="cite_ref-tom's_4-2"><a href="#cite_note-tom's-4">[4]</a></sup> 
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Berman_(lawyer)" title="Steve Berman (lawyer)">Steve Berman</a>, managing partner of Hagens Berman, said that the hard drives "failed to deliver on Seagate’s promises, and replacements from Seagate were just as defective".<sup id="cite_ref-digital_trends_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-digital_trends-6">[6]</a></sup> Bruno Ferreira of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tech_Report" title="The Tech Report">The Tech Report</a> compared the lawsuit with the high failure rates faced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Deskstar" title="IBM Deskstar">IBM Deskstar</a> 75GXP and 60GXP hard drives in 2002.<sup id="cite_ref-techreport_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-techreport-7">[7]</a></sup> Paul Alcorn of Tom's Hardware argued that Backblaze used the drives in a manner that "far exceeded the warranty conditions" and questioned the "technical merits" of the lawsuit.<sup id="cite_ref-tom's_4-3"><a href="#cite_note-tom's-4">[4]</a></sup>
