This came after a week in which several revelations about his past and present actions came to light, from several sources. Allegations of sexual and emotional abuse, of fits of violence, of additional misconduct towards those who now worked for him. I had no issue believing them. I still believe them. And not just out of some principle. I’m not one to just make a snap judgement about someone I’ve known for 6 years. The reason I believe the many allegations has roots that go back those entire 6 years. I want to talk about those 6 years now.</p><p id="e850" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">I won’t discuss too many specifics of the allegations others have made against Alec. Those aren’t my stories to tell. I have my own story.</p><p id="b248" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">There’s a hole in my life where he was until not very long ago. My relationship with Alec was complicated. He was, depending on when you asked, my friend, my collaborator, a nightmare, the origin of my PTSD, and the reason I was in therapy. Sometimes all of those at the same time. There are several people who could say the exact same thing about him. Too many, I’m finding out.</p><p id="6687" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">My time with Alec was very public in a lot of ways. Which is to say just about all anyone knows about it is what was put online at some point. In a tweet, in a video of a talk, in a podcast. But online is just that- it’s online. The vast majority of life, of our relationships, the things we do to one another, most of that never makes it onto a screen for a stranger to pick through, to respond to, to form an image with. We end up with these snapshots of personalities and events, most of which barely correspond to the whole reality of a person or the things they fill their lives with. None of that is an original observation. And it’s easy to blame that on the internet. But real life has a way of being this way too, often tragically.</p><p id="b78d" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">In June of 2013 I was a typical struggling freelance animator, designer, and artist. Alec saw my tweets, which he thought were funny, and my animations, which I guess he thought were funny as well. He got in touch and asked if I’d ever wanted to make a video game. And of course I had. We spoke for the first time that very night. We talked about what we considered interesting indie games during what was in hindsight the waning years of an indie game boom- colorful, nonviolent, narrative. Alec had made a name for himself as co-creator of the award-winning game Aquaria a few years earlier. In the years between he worked on things here and there, most notably a perpetually stalled project about a living marionette. He mentioned that project almost immediately. That he could never quite figure out what to do with it- how it looked, how it played, 2d or 3d, whatever. He was looking for a change of pace and thought I looked like a strong collaborator to get him out of his rut. I just heard “would you like to make a video game?”</p><p id="555e" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">We hit it off pretty much immediately despite being very different people. I was a 32 year old artist who had struggled to make a living since I was 18. I had been married for almost a decade. I live in Pittsburgh. Alec was 29, a wealthy game developer coming off a huge success, living in a house with a bunch of other younger developers, in Vancouver. I knew little about Canada. Alec knew next to nothing about the US. I remember him asking me what the chances were that he would get shot if he visited Pittsburgh. Not likely, I told him. Alec seemed very hyperactive, ready to go. He ran very hot, seemed to take offense to things very quickly, but balanced that with boundless enthusiasm for whatever it was he was doing. That was my first impression of him. And we were both on medications for mood disorders. So we had a lot to talk about.</p><p id="5fc3" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">The story of how our game got going has been told several times in other places, so I won’t go into it here in too much detail. The shorthand was that we messed around with some uninspired ideas for a few months, then one night I wrote the basic ideas that came to be Night In The Woods, and Alec liked them. From that point Alec trusted me with a lot of creative decisions on the game. This terrified me, as I had never ever made a game before. Alec was great at creating interesting ways for things to work, inventing little systems to do everything, creating toolsets for my novice self to use, and just figuring things out in general on a technical level. When he was at his best, at least as I knew it, this was him. In contrast, I knew nothing. I was terrified that I would have little to offer the project, and would be just dead weight.</p><p id="08b7" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">Alec suggested we take 6 months to make a prototype of the game. I told him that I couldn’t possibly take 6 months off of client work. When he suggested a kickstarter, I thought it would fail miserably, and then it didn’t. And suddenly, and not for the last time, we were NEWS. Without much warning I wasn’t a freelance animator anymore. I was a full time game developer with a legal requirement to deliver a game with someone I barely knew. We made a short little game a few weeks after the kickstarter just to make something, and show people that we were actually capable of completing something. I’d originally just wanted to make an animated yule log thing but Alec said hey, we make video games, let’s make it interactive. And so we did. I pitched him on a central mechanic and story, and we pulled it off in maybe 10 days, if I remember correctly. It became the first real installment of the Night In The Woods project. This was Longest Night. It was rough and the writing was terrible, but we were so excited. We’d made something. It was the first game I’d ever made, certainly. Alec I think was just happy to be past his block. Or so he later told me.</p><p id="b982" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">The next 6 months were a whirlwind. Bethany came on board officially. We began working on Night In The Woods full time in February of 2014. A couple months later we’d made a quick not very good demo that we showed off at GDC. Our publisher Finji, who we’d hooked up with shortly after the kickstarter, got us invited to E3 that year. My first game event ever was E3. I’d never met Alec in person before. I’d never see him more than maybe once or twice a year since. Our E3 experience was exhausting and demanding, but our demo got some favorable press, picking up some early buzz as a game to watch.</p><p id="b8c4" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">Earlier that year at GDC I’d watched Alec on social media, and watched him snap pretty viciously at some people. He messaged me that he was drunk and was going to go run around San Francisco until someone killed him. This was weird to hear from another 30 something colleague at an industry event. I didn’t sleep that night. The next morning he said he’d forgotten to take his meds and that being in places with a lot of people made him anxious. Fair enough, I thought. I reminded him to take his meds.</p><p id="a78f" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">A month or so later, a roommate of his texted me in the middle of the night, saying that Alec was scaring him. That he was worried Alec was going to do something to himself or someone else. I messaged Alec to see what was going on. Nothing, he said, his roommate was just being dramatic after a fight. I didn’t know any of these people. I lived in a different country. It was the middle of the night. I was worried, but the next day they seemed fine, joking around online. Just weird roommate drama, I guessed.</p><p id="93d9" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">At E3 I had a mostly good time with Alec. We clicked as partners on the E3 floor very well. I was more of a talker so I did the legwork there, while Alec helped people with controls and tweaked the build when it would crash from time to time. After a full day standing on the floor we’d walk back to the hotel and eat at the restaurant there. During those dinners he’d sometimes say something about an ex-girlfriend that caught my ear. He had nothing but very, very bad things to say about everyone he’d ever dated, going back years. All of them were horrible, just awful, they didn’t understand him. All of them, I asked? He got increasingly angry. I changed the subject. He said he was just tired, he didn’t know what he was talking about.</p><p id="408a" class="fm fn dc bk fo b fp fq fr fs ft fu fv fw fx fy fz cu">Alec would make comments from time to time that seemed off and always explained them later as him being tired, or he didn’t know what he meant, etc. I didn’t know the guy well at the time. I didn’t know that corner of the indie games scene other than it seemed like a social mess. I didn’t know who almost any of the people he mentioned were.</p></div></div></div></div>
