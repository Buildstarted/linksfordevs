<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recent events across the world have had a devastating impact on many people’s lives. The earthquake in Mexico City, Hurricane Harvey in Houston, and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico have all taken their toll - not to mention the many refugees that have been displaced over the last few years because of the conflict in Syria. Our hearts go out to all who have suffered so much, especially to the young children who are innocent that have been caught up in these tragic events. And because our hearts go out to them, we as artists are combining our efforts and doing what we do best - draw and paint. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The result is this beautiful digital art book called <em>Beginnings</em>, which celebrates the innocence and wonder of childhood. Coming in PDF format, the book will be perfect for viewing on an iPad or similar tablet, or on a desktop computer. We’ve partnered with the wonderful people at Save the Children and Crowdrise in order to make this happen. For a donation of just $10 to this campaign, you can download a copy of <em>Beginnings </em>as a gift from all of us. All of the proceeds go towards Save the Children which directly blesses the lives of many innocent children around the world that are in need right now. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each artist that contributed to this book was asked a simple question: what inspired you as a child? Maybe it was a person they looked up to. Or perhaps it was a beautiful location. It could have been a particular moment in time or a set of events that brings back feelings of nostalgia. Or maybe it was just the interesting way in which they saw the world as a kid. Each person answered for themselves and over 60 professional artists from around the world and from the various fields of animation, comics, cartooning, illustration, and visual development contributed, including: Max Grecke, Elsa Chang, Brett Bean, Wouter Tulp, Armand Serrano, Pernille Orum, Adam Rex, Floyd Norman, Gustavo Duarte, Dave Guertin and Greg Baldwin from CreatureBox, Nathan Fowkes, Ty Carter, and many more! Half the fun of this book will be in discovering the answers they came up with and gaining a little insight into their younger years. The other half of the fun, of course, will be in seeing all of the stunning new artwork that they spent hours creating in order to support this cause.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your generous donation to Save the Children! We hope you enjoy the book and that it, in return, becomes a source of inspiration to you..</p></div></div></div>
