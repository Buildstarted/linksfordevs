That word implies an association that brings ridicule, one that makes you ashamed by association,&nbsp;and if <em>that’s</em> something you claim to have experienced over the past eight years by having Barack Obama representing you in the world—I’m going to suggest you rethink your word choice.</strong></p><p><strong>You weren’t “embarrassed” by Barack Obama.</strong></p><p><strong>You were threatened by him.<br>You were intimidated by him.<br>You were challenged by him.<br>You were triggered by him.</strong></p><p><strong>But I don’t believe it had anything to do with his resume or his experience or his character or his conduct in office—because you seem fully proud right now to be associated with a three-time married, serial adulterer&nbsp;and confessed predator; a man whose election and business dealings and relationships are riddled with controversy and malfeasance. You’re perfectly fine being represented by a bullying, vile, obnoxious, genitalia-grabbing, Tweet-ranting, Prime Minister-shoving charlatan who’s managed to offend all our allies and alienate millions of our citizens in a few short months. And you’re okay with him putting on religious faith like a rented, dusty, ill-fitting tuxedo and immediately tossing it in the garbage when he’s finished with it.</strong></p><p><strong>None of that you’re embarrassed by? I wonder how that works. </strong></p><p><strong>Actually, I’m afraid I have an idea.</strong></p><p><strong>Listen, you’re perfectly within your rights to have disagreed with Barack Obama’s&nbsp;policies or to have taken issue with his tactics. No one’s claiming he was a flawless politician or a perfect human being. But somehow I don’t think that’s what we’re talking about here. I think the thing President Obama did that <em>really</em> upset you, white friend—was having a complexion that was far darker than you were ever comfortable with. I think the President we have&nbsp;now feels much better.</strong></p><p><strong>Because objectively speaking, if what’s happening in our country right now doesn’t cause you great shame and doesn’t induce the continual meeting of your palm to your face—I don’t believe embarrassment is ever something you struggle with.</strong></p><p><strong>No, if you claimed to be embarrassed by Barack Obama but you’re somehow not embarrassed by Donald Trump—I’m going to strongly suggest it was largely a pigmentation issue.</strong></p><p><strong>And as an American and a Christian committed to diversity and equality and to the liberty at the heart of this nation—<em>that </em>embarrasses me.</strong></p><p>Get John’s book, ‘HOPE AND OTHER SUPERPOWERS’ <a href="https://johnpavlovitz.com/books/#hope-book">here</a>!</p></div></div></div></div>
