That word implies an association that brings ridicule, one that makes you ashamed by association,&#xA0;and if <em>that&#x2019;s</em> something you claim to have experienced over the past eight years by having Barack Obama representing you in the world&#x2014;I&#x2019;m going to suggest you rethink your word choice.</strong></p><p><strong>You weren&#x2019;t &#x201C;embarrassed&#x201D; by Barack Obama.</strong></p><p><strong>You were threatened by him. You were intimidated by him. You were challenged by him.<p> You were triggered by him.</p></strong></p><p><strong>But I don&#x2019;t believe it had anything to do with his resume or his experience or his character or his conduct in office&#x2014;because you seem fully proud right now to be associated with a three-time married, serial adulterer&#xA0;and confessed predator; a man whose election and business dealings and relationships are riddled with controversy and malfeasance. You&#x2019;re perfectly fine being represented by a bullying, vile, obnoxious, genitalia-grabbing, Tweet-ranting, Prime Minister-shoving charlatan who&#x2019;s managed to offend all our allies and alienate millions of our citizens in a few short months. And you&#x2019;re okay with him putting on religious faith like a rented, dusty, ill-fitting tuxedo and immediately tossing it in the garbage when he&#x2019;s finished with it.</strong></p><p><strong>None of that you&#x2019;re embarrassed by? I wonder how that works. </strong></p><p><strong>Actually, I&#x2019;m afraid I have an idea.</strong></p><p><strong>Listen, you&#x2019;re perfectly within your rights to have disagreed with Barack Obama&#x2019;s&#xA0;policies or to have taken issue with his tactics. No one&#x2019;s claiming he was a flawless politician or a perfect human being. But somehow I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re talking about here. I think the thing President Obama did that <em>really</em> upset you, white friend&#x2014;was having a complexion that was far darker than you were ever comfortable with. I think the President we have&#xA0;now feels much better.</strong></p><p><strong>Because objectively speaking, if what&#x2019;s happening in our country right now doesn&#x2019;t cause you great shame and doesn&#x2019;t induce the continual meeting of your palm to your face&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t believe embarrassment is ever something you struggle with.</strong></p><p><strong>No, if you claimed to be embarrassed by Barack Obama but you&#x2019;re somehow not embarrassed by Donald Trump&#x2014;I&#x2019;m going to strongly suggest it was largely a pigmentation issue.</strong></p><p><strong>And as an American and a Christian committed to diversity and equality and to the liberty at the heart of this nation&#x2014;<em>that </em>embarrasses me.</strong></p><p>Get John&#x2019;s book, &#x2018;HOPE AND OTHER SUPERPOWERS&#x2019; <a href="https://johnpavlovitz.com/books/#hope-book">here</a>!</p></div></article>
