However, I didn't want to say anything earlier because (<em>no matter how I word it</em>) - it will imply that I didn't think it deserved it <em>(or worse, that I'm a "sore loser")</em>.</p><p>Honestly, I've only played Dykie Street a bit (<em>mainly because I don't understand much French - sorry!</em>). TBH, I was more surprised with "Heavy Karate from Hell" winning best music (<em>again, REALLY not trying to bash it here</em>) - but it's tough not to be surprised when compared to the other MANY impressive nominees.</p><p>At the end of the day - if any vote "stacking" was done (<em>e.g. asking friends/classmates to vote</em>), then that's fine - as it seems no rules were broken. Is what it is. <strong>¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</strong></p><p>For me, as <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=9551"> @kittenm4ster</a> says above - it really was just an honour to be nominated for awards. Anything more would've been just a bonus ;o)</p><p>I would also like to publicly thank <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=24585"> @Jusiv</a> again for creating, organising and running this whole awards system <strong>BY HIMSELF</strong>, unprompted, just because he thought it would be a nice thing to do for the PICO-8 community. <strong>*claps*</strong></p><p>And again, congrats to the winners and all the nominees.</p></div></div></div></div>
