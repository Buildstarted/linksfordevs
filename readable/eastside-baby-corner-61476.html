<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EBC helps kids reach their full potential tomorrow by meeting basic needs today.  The immediate, tangible assistance kids and families receive through EBC provides the tools caregivers need to care for their family, and the essentials kids need to grow up healthy. Through a network of agency partners, low-income children each week get what they need, when they need it.  Because of EBC, children, ages birth through 12 are warm, safe, and fed. </p></div><div><p>EBC strengthens families, builds resilient kids, reduces inequity for a stronger community through the procurement, packaging and distributing of critical essentials for children (ages 0-12) living in poverty or distress.  The community donates children's clothing and goods, and EBC purchases vital supplies for children, such as formula, car seats, pack-n-play beds, and diapers.  Volunteers donate nearly  30,000 hours annually. Founded in 1990, EBC annually distributes more than 110,000 orders of essentials for kids in central Puget Sound, including King, south Snohomish, Kitsap, and west Pierce Counties.</p><p>Spring 2020 Update:  The public health crisis of spring 2020 means more families needing tangible assistance today and in the foreseeable future.  Families need diapers, clothes, formula, school supplies...and much more to care for their children.  EBC's agency partners need our support as they help families find housing, financial assistance, protection from domestic violence,  support parents, provide medical aid, or teach our children.  Kids need both, and they need to be safe, warm, and nourished.  </p><p>In 2019, the lives of 9,132 children (unduplicated) in our area were changed by giving them tangible goods that reduce the stress of living in poverty, promote their health and well-being, and prepare them for success in school.  The assistance EBC provides not only helps kids, but their family as well - imagine trying to care for a baby without having diapers, or formula, or having shoes and coat for a schoolchild.  The enormous stress on a family struggling with economic issues or disruption can harm the relationship between child and caregiver, as well as the child's health.  That's why EBC is here, providing families engaged with 54 organizations like Hopelink, YES, and Head Start, with the goods kids need:  1, 098, 184 diaper changes in 2019, 5,339 cans of formula, 1,653 car seats, 1,692,400 diaper wipes, and over 7,500 Big Bundles (a week's worth of clothing, shoes, coat, toothbrush/paste, toys, and books), and much, much more.</p><hr></div><div><p>We would like to thank Christian Manley Orthodontics for their generous support in matching fund donations made to EBC . Because of Dr. Manley and other loyal supporters, we are able to increase your donation made to Give Big with matching funds.</p><p>Thank you to our anonymous donor for their generous support of Give Big on May 6th with a $5,000 match for donations made today.</p><p>We have hit our goal and are beyond  grateful for the outpouring of community support. With every donation to EBC through GiveBig Washington, EBC can keep babies dry and fed and school children dressed and ready for learning. EBC is also committed to helping those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic through our Rapid Response Program. We are open and filling orders daily for the essentials that children need.</p><hr></div></div></div>
