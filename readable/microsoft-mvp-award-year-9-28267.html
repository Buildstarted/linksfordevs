            <p>I've become especially reflective of my career this year, especially as <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/project-svalbard-the-future-of-have-i-been-pwned/">Project Svalbard</a> marches forward and I look back on what it's taken to get here. Especially as I have more discussions around the various turning points in my professional life, there's one that stands out above most others: my first MVP award.</p><p>This is not a path I planned, in fact when I originally got that award I referred to myself as <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/accidental-mvp/">The Accidental MVP</a>. But I also think that's the best way to earn any of the awards I've since received; not by setting out with the award as the goal, but rather focusing on the activities for which the award is granted. I wrote a blog people found useful and I continue to do that today. The first award prompted me to start speaking publicly and obviously that's something I continue to do today too. So, before anyone asks "how do I become a Microsoft MVP", there's your answer. That and a pointer to the page on <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/pages/what-it-takes-to-be-an-mvp">What it takes to be an MVP</a>.</p><p>One last thing to add to that and it's the value of community <em>encouragement</em>. There's no way I would have stuck to this path if it wasn't for all the social media engagement, blog comments and conference selfies. It's hard to express just how what a massive role encouragement plays in keeping me motivated to do this; knowing that your work is valued is just absolutely essential and I still get a kick of seeing messages like this from just last week in Israel:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-0" data-tweet-id="1144582824177078273"></twitter-widget> <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Incidentally, <a href="https://rd.microsoft.com/en-us/troy-hunt">I'm still a Microsoft Regional Director too</a> which runs as a parallel program. I still don't have a region, I still don't direct anything and I still don't get paid by Microsoft. Everyone with me? Good!</p>
