And with record-breaking heat and bushfires getting even larger, it feels like Australia is living in the future. That future, unfortunately, looks a lot like <em>Mad Max</em>.<br></p><p>Police in New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, report that a farmer in the small town of Evans Plain had about 80,000 gallons of water (300,000 liters) stolen from his property, according to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/300000-litres-of-water-stolen-from-droughthit-community/news-story/af8a0b02d303c16c34c9258b93533ad7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/300000-litres-of-water-stolen-from-droughthit-community/news-story/af8a0b02d303c16c34c9258b93533ad7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Australian</em></a></span> newspaper. The farmer only noticed the theft from two enormous storage tanks on Sunday, though it could have happened at anytime between December 9 and December 15, according to authorities.</p><p>It’s becoming more and more common to see thieves targeting water storage facilities, as climate change continues to devastate Australia as it heads into summer. Just a couple of weeks ago, thieves in the small town of Murwillumbah stole about 6,600 gallons (25,000 liters) of water, enough to fill about six or seven fire trucks, according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/tens-of-thousands-of-litres-of-water-stolen-in-northern-nsw-20191212-p53jgx.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/tens-of-thousands-of-litres-of-water-stolen-in-northern-nsw-20191212-p53jgx.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local authorities</a></span>. </p><p>And it all feels like something out of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d605rM0U3x0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d605rM0U3x0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sci-fi dystopia</a></span>, where battles over water are fought to sustain a meager existence.</p><p>Australia is reeling from extreme heat this week, breaking temperature records for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://earther.gizmodo.com/australia-just-set-a-new-heat-record-1840506655&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/australia-just-set-a-new-heat-record-1840506655">past three days</a></span>, and reaching an average maximum temperature of 40.9 degrees Celsius (105.6 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, 41.9 degrees Celsius (107.4 degrees Fahrenheit) on Wednesday, and 40.7 degrees Celsius (105.2 degrees Fahrenheit) on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/finger-pointed-at-climate-change-as-heatwave-smashes-records/11817884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/finger-pointed-at-climate-change-as-heatwave-smashes-records/11817884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thursday</a></span>.</p><p>“We’re smashing the extremes by effectively a degree relative to the other cases because that’s by how much the Australian temperatures have warmed,” climate scientist David Karoly told the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/finger-pointed-at-climate-change-as-heatwave-smashes-records/11817884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/finger-pointed-at-climate-change-as-heatwave-smashes-records/11817884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC</a></span> on Friday. “Climate change has contributed between 1C and 1.5C on top of the natural variability.”</p><p>And it’s not just the heat.
