<p><code>Sundown</code> is a Markdown parser based on the original code of the
<a href="http://fossil.instinctive.eu/libupskirt/index" rel="nofollow">Upskirt library</a> by Natacha PortÃ©.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fully standards compliant</strong></p>
<p><code>Sundown</code> passes out of the box the official Markdown v1.0.0 and v1.0.3
test suites, and has been extensively tested with additional corner cases
to make sure its output is as sane as possible at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Massive extension support</strong></p>
<p><code>Sundown</code> has optional support for several (unofficial) Markdown extensions,
such as non-strict emphasis, fenced code blocks, tables, autolinks,
strikethrough and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-8 aware</strong></p>
<p><code>Sundown</code> is fully UTF-8 aware, both when parsing the source document and when
generating the resulting (X)HTML code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tested &amp; Ready to be used on production</strong></p>
<p><code>Sundown</code> has been extensively security audited, and includes protection against
all possible DOS attacks (stack overflows, out of memory situations, malformed
Markdown syntax...) and against client attacks through malicious embedded HTML.</p>
<p>We've worked very hard to make <code>Sundown</code> never crash or run out of memory
under <em>any</em> input. <code>Sundown</code> renders all the Markdown content in GitHub and so
far hasn't crashed a single time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customizable renderers</strong></p>
<p><code>Sundown</code> is not stuck with XHTML output: the Markdown parser of the library
is decoupled from the renderer, so it's trivial to extend the library with
custom renderers. A fully functional (X)HTML renderer is included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimized for speed</strong></p>
<p><code>Sundown</code> is written in C, with a special emphasis on performance. When wrapped
on a dynamic language such as Python or Ruby, it has shown to be up to 40
times faster than other native alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zero-dependency</strong></p>
<p><code>Sundown</code> is a zero-dependency library composed of 3 <code>.c</code> files and their headers.
No dependencies, no bullshit. Only standard C99 that builds everywhere.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p><code>Sundown</code> is based on the original Upskirt parser by Natacha PortÃ©, with many additions
by Vicent Marti (@vmg) and contributions from the following authors:</p>
<pre><code>Ben Noordhuis, Bruno Michel, Joseph Koshy, Krzysztof Kowalczyk, Samuel Bronson,
Shuhei Tanuma
</code></pre>
<h2>Bindings</h2>
<p><code>Sundown</code> is available from other programming languages thanks to these bindings developed
by our awesome contributors.</p>

<h2>Help us</h2>
<p><code>Sundown</code> is all about security. If you find a (potential) security vulnerability in the
library, or a way to make it crash through malicious input, please report it to us,
either directly via email or by opening an Issue on GitHub, and help make the web safer
for everybody.</p>
<h2>Unicode character handling</h2>
<p>Given that the Markdown spec makes no provision for Unicode character handling, <code>Sundown</code>
takes a conservative approach towards deciding which extended characters trigger Markdown
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Punctuation characters outside of the U+007F codepoint are not handled as punctuation.
They are considered as normal, in-word characters for word-boundary checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whitespace characters outside of the U+007F codepoint are not considered as
whitespace. They are considered as normal, in-word characters for word-boundary checks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>There is nothing to install. <code>Sundown</code> is composed of 3 <code>.c</code> files (<code>markdown.c</code>,
<code>buffer.c</code> and <code>array.c</code>), so just throw them in your project. Zero-dependency means
zero-dependency. You might want to include <code>render/html.c</code> if you want to use the
included XHTML renderer, or write your own renderer. Either way, it's all fun and joy.</p>
<p>If you are hardcore, you can use the included <code>Makefile</code> to build <code>Sundown</code> into a dynamic
library, or to build the sample <code>sundown</code> executable, which is just a commandline
Markdown to XHTML parser. (If gcc gives you grief about <code>-fPIC</code>, e.g. with MinGW, try
<code>make MFLAGS=</code> instead of just <code>make</code>.)</p>
