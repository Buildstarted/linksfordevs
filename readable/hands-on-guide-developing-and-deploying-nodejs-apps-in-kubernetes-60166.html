  --name<span>=</span>mongo 
  --rm 
  --network<span>=</span>knote mongo</span></code></pre></div><p>Note the following about this command:</p><ul><li><code>--name</code> defines the name for the container â€” if you don't specify a name explicitly, then a name is generated automatically</li><li><code>--rm</code> automatically cleans up the container and removes the file system when the container exits</li><li><code>--network</code> represents the Docker network in which the container should run â€” when omitted, the container runs in the default network</li><li><code>mongo</code> is the name of the Docker image that you want to run</li></ul><p>Note that the <code>docker run</code> command automatically downloads the <code>mongo</code> image from Docker Hub if it's not yet present on your machine.</p><p>MongoDB is now running.</p><p><strong>Now you can run your app as follows:</strong></p><div><header><p>bash</p></header><pre><code><span>docker run

  knote</span></code></pre></div><p>Note the following about this command:</p><ul><li><code>--name</code> defines the name for the container</li><li><code>--rm</code> automatically cleans up the container and removes the file system when the container exits</li><li><code>--network</code> represents the Docker network in which the container should run</li><li><code>-p 3000:3000</code> publishes port 3000 of the container to port 3000 of your local machine. That means, if you now access port 3000 on your computer, the request is forwarded to port 3000 of the Knote container. You can use the forwarding to access the app from your local machine.</li><li><code>-e</code> sets an environment variable inside the container</li></ul><p>Regarding the last point, remember that your app reads the URL of the MongoDB server to connect to from the <code>MONGO_URL</code> environment variable.</p><p>If you look closely at the value of <code>MONGO_URL</code>, you see that the hostname is <code>mongo</code>.</p><p><em>Why is it <code>mongo</code> and not an IP address?</em></p><p><code>mongo</code> is precisely the name that you gave to the MongoDB container with the <code>--name=mongo</code> flag.</p><p>If you named your MongoDB container <code>foo</code>, then you would need to change the value of <code>MONGO_URL</code> to <code>mongodb://foo:27017</code>.</p><p><strong>Containers in the same Docker network can talk to each other by their names.</strong></p><p>This is made possible by a built-in DNS mechanism.</p><p><em>You should now have two containers running on your machine, <code>knote</code> and <code>mongo</code>.</em></p><p>You can display all running containers with the following command:</p><div><header><p>bash</p></header><pre><code><span>docker <span>ps</span>
