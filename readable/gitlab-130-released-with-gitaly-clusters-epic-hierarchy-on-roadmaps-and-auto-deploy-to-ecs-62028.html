<h2 id="progress-since-gitlab-120">Progress since GitLab 12.0</h2>
<p>At this milestone release of 13.0, we’d like to take a moment to reflect. We’ve accomplished so much since our 12.0 release! We've put together a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/05/21/version-12-year-in-review/">blog to recap GitLab 12.0 to 12.10</a>. Three favorites from version 12 releases include: <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released/#create-and-view-requirements-in-gitlab">Requirements Management</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/defend/container_network_security/">Container Network Security</a>, and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/01/22/gitlab-12-7-released/#parent-child-pipelines">Parent-child pipelines</a>. In addition to product enhancements, we've embraced <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/2020-04-21-gitLab-ramps-up-channel-and-partner-investment-with-launch-of-a-new-global-partner-program.html">partnerships/integrations</a>, adding <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/integrations/secure.html">integration guidelines</a> for third-party security scanners, and have grown our <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/services/catalog/">professional services</a> to help you with things like Jira and Jenkins migrations. Our new channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFGfElNsQthYDx0A_FaNNfUm9NHsK6zED">Learn@GitLab</a> makes it easy to find many new how-to videos such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0iQD1qgxZg&amp;list=PLFGfElNsQthYDx0A_FaNNfUm9NHsK6zED&amp;index=10&amp;t=0s">Getting started with CI</a>.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-is-the-key-to-resilience">Iteration is the key to resilience</h2>
<p>GitLab is enabling IT and business teams to adapt, respond, and thrive. <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/02/04/power-of-iteration/">Iteration</a> is the key. To do so you must collaborate rapidly, optimize for efficiency, and automate processes to handle security and compliance while you focus on delivering business value. GitLab 13.0 can help you iterate quickly and with greater insight. At the same time, access to Git repositories is critical, and we have enhanced our <a href="#gitaly-cluster-for-high-availability-git-storage">Gitaly cluster for high availability Git storage</a> to ensure there are always multiple warm replicas ready to take over if an outage occurs.</p>
<h3 id="rapidly-collaborate-and-respond-across-the-entire-team">Rapidly collaborate and respond across the entire team</h3>
<p>GitLab builds upon capabilities that help with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFNUjvgm2_4">collaborative development</a>, reporting, organizing, and managing work. Version control is foundational to collaboration and, with 13.0, we have added <a href="#versioned-snippets">version control for snippets</a>. To manage more complex projects, 13.0 allows you to <a href="#view-epic-hierarchy-on-a-roadmap">view the epic hierarchy on your roadmap</a>, <a href="#view-milestones-on-the-roadmap">view how your epics line up with your various milestones</a>, and <a href="#update-releases-milestone-in-web-ui">add a single or multiple milestones to your releases</a> while <a href="#raise-warning-when-closing-an-issue-with-open-blockers">alerts upon closing an issue with open blockers</a> help you focus on critical path items.</p>
<p>Designers are an important part of the development team. While working on one of the most popular new features, the <a href="#dark-theme-in-the-web-ide">dark themed web IDE</a>, we <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/05/20/creating-a-dark-ui-for-gitlabs-web-ide/index.html">learned how</a> to pull designers in to collaborate more closely. At the same time, we moved <a href="#design-management-moved-to-core">Design Management to core</a> recognizing users who are designing products as individual contributors.</p>
<h3 id="optimize-for-efficiency">Optimize for efficiency</h3>
<p>As many businesses strive to be more responsive and efficient, GitLab helps streamline existing software development processes. New features aimed at efficiency include things like <a href="#auto-deploy-to-ecs">simplified deployment to Amazon ECS</a> and a new consolidated <a href="#aggregate-it-alerts-from-external-tools-in-gitlab">list of alerts</a> that provides a single interface aggregating IT alerts originating from multiple sources. In addition, Terraform users will rejoice. GitLab 13.0 lets you <a href="#review-summary-of-terraform-plan-in-merge-requests">review the summary of <code>terraform plan</code> in Merge Requests</a> and <a href="#gitlab-http-terraform-state-backend">use GitLab as an HTTP Terraform state backend</a>.</p>
<h3 id="trust-your-processes-and-dont-sacrifice-security-or-compliance">Trust your processes and don’t sacrifice security or compliance</h3>
<p>GitLab helps businesses embrace security and compliance controls end-to-end in the software development lifecycle, reducing risk and freeing up resources to focus on business critical needs. Our Application Security Testing capabilities help you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgCHtr-6uG8&amp;list=PLFGfElNsQthYDx0A_FaNNfUm9NHsK6zED&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s">find and fix security vulnerabilities earlier</a> and for these, GitLab was just named as a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/resources/report-gartner-mq-ast/">Niche Player</a> in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing. Since Gartner's evaluation of 12.4, we have added many new features. In 13.0 alone we've added the ability to <a href="#rest-api-support-for-dast-scans">scan REST APIs via DAST</a> and a <a href="#secret-detection-for-the-full-history-of-a-repository">full commit history scan for secrets</a> for even greater detection. More importantly, we have rearchitected the way we handle <a href="#standalone-vulnerability-objects">vulnerability objects</a>. This enabled the ability to <a href="#export-vulnerabilities-list-from-project-security-dashboard">export vulnerabilities from the security dashboard</a> and will unlock many more robust <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/defend/vulnerability_management/">Vulnerability Management</a> capabilities in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to security scanning, GitLab automates policies and, with 13.0, provides more granular control with new features such as setting a <a href="#implement-a-deployment-freeze-with-the-freeze-period-api">deployment freeze with the Freeze Period API</a> to easily prevent an unintended production release during a specified period of time. To simplify audits, you can now <a href="#filtered-search-for-instance-level-audit-events">filter search for instance-level audit events</a> as part of a the <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3179">larger epic</a>.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>We are excited about our <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/upcoming-releases/">upcoming releases</a>, particularly features that will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/dev/#enterprise-compliance">compliance framework</a> and automatically adopt associated controls and reporting</li>
<li>Iterate with better insight with <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2966">A/B testing</a> and control via several Feature Flag enhancements (<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35558">filter feature flags by status</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/34813">A/B testing based on feature flags</a>, and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33394">ability to create feature flag from merge request</a>)</li>
<li>Identify bottlenecks and waste by visually depicting <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210315">Value Stream Analytics stages as a flow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214729">Manage policies</a> and let GitLab automate their use, including things like an <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216074">out-of-the-box Container Network Policy set</a></li>
<li>Work within an ecosystem to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33906">fuzz test</a> application APIs, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28321">read Vault CI variables</a></li>

Gitaly Cluster for high availability Git storage
</h2>

<p>GitLab now supports highly available Git storage without using NFS. High Availability (HA) configurations improve the availability of important systems, like Git storage, by removing single points of failure, detecting outages, and automatically switching to a replica. This means that an individual component of the system can fail without causing the end user to experience an outage. Access to Git repositories is critical to developers and businesses, because when an outage occurs, developers can’t push code, and deployments are blocked.</p>
<p>Internally, Git repository storage is handled by <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/09/12/the-road-to-gitaly-1-0/">Gitaly</a>, and now Praefect too. Praefect is a new router and transaction manager we built for Gitaly to coordinate leader election and asynchronous replication. When using a Gitaly Cluster, requests for Git data are routed through one of multiple Praefect nodes to a Gitaly node. This means that there are always multiple warm replicas ready to take over if an outage occurs.</p>
<p>In the future we plan to support <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1189">strong consistency</a>, so that write operations succeed on multiple Gitaly nodes, before responding with a success signal, and support <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2013">horizontally distributing reads</a> so that CPU and memory resources can be better scaled.</p>

Auto Deploy to ECS
</h2>

<p>Until now,&nbsp;there hasn’t been a simple way to deploy to Amazon Web Services.&nbsp;As a result, Gitlab users had to&nbsp; spend a lot of time figuring out their own configuration.</p>
<p>In Gitlab 13.0, Auto DevOps has been extended to support deployment to AWS! Gitlab users who are deploying to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) can now take advantage of Auto DevOps, even if they are not using Kubernetes. Auto DevOps simplifies and accelerates delivery and cloud deployment with a complete delivery pipeline out of the box. Simply commit code and Gitlab does the rest! With the elimination of the complexities, teams can focus on the innovative aspects of software creation!</p>
<p>In order to enable this workflow, users need to define AWS typed environment variables: ‘AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID’ ‘AWS_ACCOUNT_ID’ and ‘AWS_REGION’, and enable Auto DevOps. Then, your ECS deployment will be automatically built for you with a complete, automatic, delivery pipeline.</p>

View Epic hierarchy on a Roadmap
</h2>

<p>When leveraging Multi-Level Epics, it can be difficult to keep track of where each child epic lives on the Roadmap. You can now quickly expand
a parent epic on your roadmap to view all its child epics to ensure work is properly organized and your planned timeline is on track!</p>

Versioned Snippets
</h2>

<p>Snippets are useful for sharing small bits of code and text that may not belong in the main project’s codebase. These items are important to groups and users who rely on them for other tasks, like scripts to help generate diagnostic output or setup supporting services for testing and demo environments. Unfortunately, a lack of version control has made it hard to know if a snippet was the latest version or what changes may have happened and how to reconcile those.</p>
<p>Snippets in GitLab are now version controlled by a Git repository. When editing a Snippet, each change creates a commit. Snippets can also be cloned to make edits locally, and then pushed back to the Snippet repository.</p>
<p>This is the first step in enabling more collaboration on Snippets. In future releases we’ll introduce support for <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2829">multiple files</a>, continue to <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2830">expand features</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2521">expand permissions</a>.</p>

Dark Theme in the Web IDE
</h2>

<p>For people who spend time working in code editors, the ability to customize the environment to match their preferences is important. Dark themes are some of the most <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&amp;category=Themes&amp;sortBy=Installs">popular</a> for other editors and important for providing a comfortable experience. It’s also clear that GitLab users love their dark themes as a Dark Application theme for all of GitLab is the second most popular request in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?sort=popularity">GitLab Issue Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>The GitLab Web IDE is now completely themed dark for users who choose the <strong>Dark</strong> <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/preferences.html#syntax-highlighting-theme">syntax highlighting theme perference</a>. This is an important step in delivering an editing experience users love and a valuable step in understanding how the GitLab UI responds to dark themes.

Standalone Vulnerability Objects
</h2>

<p>We are excited to announce the first feature release for Vulnerability
Management, standalone vulnerability objects. With this release, we’ve
implemented a new vulnerability object model, enabling a whole new set
of capabilities that span the entire lifecycle of vulnerability
management.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits is each vulnerability occurrence will now
have a unique URL, meaning a vulnerability can be directly linked to,
shared, referenced, and tracked as the Single Source of Truth. On this page, you can change the status of a vulnerability to Detected, Confirmed, Dismissed, or Resolved. Another
benefit is vulnerability occurrences will persist across scanner runs.
Previously, running scans on the same branch would overwrite any
previous findings with the new results. Persisting vulnerabilities will
improve tracking, visibility, and cut down on duplication of findings
between runs. It also enables the future ability to report on group and
project vulnerability trends over time across a broad range of
variables.</p>

REST API support for DAST scans
</h2>

<p>GitLab 13.0 supports DAST scans of REST APIs. This allows for full DAST security coverage of an application, not just the UI. By supporting use of an OpenAPI specification as a guide for what URLs and REST endpoints need to be scanned, DAST helps secure an application’s entire attack surface and provides more insight into the potential vulnerabilities of any running application.</p>

Review summary of `terraform plan` in Merge Requests
</h2>

<p>If you use Terraform to define your infrastructure as code, you know the pain of having to pass around the resulting changes from your <code>terraform plan</code> command in slack and MR comments. In GitLab 13.0, you can now see the summary of your <code>terraform plan</code> command in the context where it is most useful, directly in your merge request. This helps you to more quickly verify your infrastructure changes and gives you a place to collaborate with your team members on the intended effects of your infrastructure as code changes.</p>
<p>Users of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Terraform.gitlab-ci.yml">Terraform template provided by GitLab</a> will see the <code>terraform plan</code> merge request widget without additional configuration. Users of customized CI/CD templates for Terraform can update their template to use the image and scripts in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Terraform.gitlab-ci.yml">official GitLab Terraform template</a>.</p>

GitLab HTTP Terraform state backend
</h2>

<p>Users of Terraform know the pain of setting up their state file (a map of your configuration to real-world resources that also keeps track of additional metadata). The process includes starting a new Terraform project and setting up a third party backend to store the state file that is reliable, secure, and outside of your git repo.</p>
<p>Many users wanted a simpler way to set up their state file storage without involving additional services or setups. Starting with GitLab 13.0, GitLab can be used as an HTTP backend for Terraform, eliminating the need to set up state storage separately for every new project.</p>
<p>The GitLab HTTP Terraform state backend allows for a seamless experience with minimal configuration, and the ability to store your state files in a location controlled by the GitLab instance. They can be accessed using Terraform’s <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/http.html">HTTP backend</a>, leveraging GitLab for authentication. Users can migrate to the GitLab HTTP Terraform backend easily, while also accessing it from their local terminals.</p>
<p>The GitLab HTTP Terraform state backend supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple named state files per project</li>
<li>Locking</li>
<li>Object storage</li>
<li>Encryption at rest</li>
</ul>
<p>It is available both for GitLab Self-Managed installations and on GitLab.com.</p>

Exclude large files using Partial Clone
</h2>

<p>Storing large binary files in Git is normally discouraged, because every large file added will be downloaded by everyone who clones or fetches changes thereafter. This is slow, if not a complete obstruction when working from a slow or unreliable internet connection.</p>
<p>In GitLab 13.0, Partial Clone has been enabled for blob size filters, as well as experimentally for other filters. This allows troublesome large files to be excluded from clones and fetches. When Git encounters a missing file, it will be downloaded on demand. When cloning a project, use the <code>--filter=blob:none</code> or <code>--filer=blob:limit=1m</code> to exclude blobs completely or by file size. Note, Partial Clone requires at least Git 2.22.0.</p>
<p>Read more in our recent blog, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/03/13/partial-clone-for-massive-repositories/">How Git Partial Clone lets you fetch only the large file you need</a>.</p>

Use variables to power metric dashboards
</h2>

<p>In GitLab 13.0, you can create dashboards powered by variables, enabling you to use a single dashboard to monitor multiple services and components, rather than creating hard-coded dashboards for each service you want to monitor. Instead of the time-consuming and repetitive task of recreating similar dashboards multiple times, you can now create a single dashboard and use variables to change the data you view in it.</p>

Reduced memory consumption of GitLab with Puma
</h2>

<p>Puma is now the default web application server for both the Omnibus-based and Helm-based installations. Puma reduces the memory footprint of GitLab by about 40% compared to Unicorn, increasing the efficiency of GitLab and potentially saving costs for self-hosted instances.</p>
<p>Installations which have customized the number of Unicorn processes, or use a slower NFS drive, may have to adjust the default Puma configuration. See the <a href="#upgrade">Important notes on upgrading</a> and <a href="#gitlab-helm-chart-improvements">GitLab chart improvements</a> for additional details.</p>

Filtered search for instance-level audit events
</h3>

<p>When you need to find a specific event, either for audit reporting or to investigate incidents, it should be easy. It shouldn’t require a lot of time to manually dig through a large data set.</p>
<p>Now, you can perform filtered searches on a single object, e.g., a user, group, or project in the instance-level audit events table to make this process much easier. This feature is available for self-managed customers only, but will be extended to groups and projects as part of a <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3179">the larger epic</a> to make the instance, group, and project-level audit events experiences uniform and much friendlier to use.</p>

Enable group-level default branch protection
</h3>

<p>Previously, the translation of instance-level <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/7583">default branch protection</a> settings down into projects was confusing because, in certain scenarios, it created an unintuitive experience: developers could not push new commits to projects they could create. This made it difficult for organizations to strike a balance between mitigating risk and allowing carte blanche access to projects for all developers since the workaround required promoting them to Maintainer.</p>
<p>Now, default branch protection can be set at the group level to provide better flexibility for administrators and group owners. Using a combination of default branch protection and default project creation settings, organizations can <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7583#note_288469003">find the right mix</a> of autonomy and control, such as using custom default branch protection and allowing only maintainers to create new projects. This would allow developers to push new commits (not force push or delete a branch) to new projects, but allow maintainers to control project creation.</p>
<p>This group-level configuration of default branch protection can <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.html#disable-group-owners-from-updating-default-branch-protection-premium-only">be disabled</a> for organizations requiring more strict controls in place. By disabling the group-level setting for default branch protection, maintainers can apply more stringent controls on developer access and permissions.</p>

Raise warning when closing an issue with open blockers
</h3>

<p>In GitLab 12.8, we <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released/#blocking-issue-support">introduced</a> the ability to create dependencies between issues, where one issue can block another related issue. This means that the downstream issue should not be closed until the predecessor is completed and closed. This required you to check to see if an issue is blocked before you closed it.</p>
<p>Having to check if an issue is blocked prior to closing the issue is an
additional step that is unnecessary and easy to forget.</p>
<p>We’ve eliminated that step by showing you a warning if you attempt to
close an issue with unresolved blockers. We also provide links
to the blocking issues so you can verify that your issue is safe to
close.</p>
<p>This level of increased dependency alerts helps keep projects running
smoothly, and ensures that sequencing of issues can be maintained!</p>

New comparison mode for Merge Requests
</h3>

<p>Merge Requests, particularly the <strong>Changes</strong> tab, is where source code
is reviewed and discussed. In circumstances where the target branch was
merged into the source branch of the merge request, the changes in the
source and target branch can be shown mixed together making it hard to
understand which changes are being added and which already exist in the
target branch.</p>
<p>In GitLab 13.0, we are adding an experimental comparison mode, which
will show a diff calculated by simulating a merge - a more accurate
representation of the change than using the merge base of the two
branches. The new mode is available from the comparison target drop down
by selecting <strong>master (HEAD)</strong>. In the future it will
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/198458">replace</a> the
current default comparison.</p>

Syntax Highlighting Themes for the Web IDE
</h3>

<p>GitLab supports six <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/preferences.html#syntax-highlighting-theme">syntax highlighting preferences</a> when viewing code. Themes are important to developers when viewing and editing code on GitLab since it’s imperative that they work comfortably throughout the day. We’ve now released support for all six syntax highlighting preferences in the Web IDE. This includes <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201927">Solarized Dark</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201930">Solarized Light</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199883">Monokai</a> and a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216543">no highlighting</a> option.</p>
<p>Over the last few releases (for example, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released/#dark-syntax-highlighting-theme-for-web-ide">12.8</a> and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released/#white-syntax-highlighting-theme-for-web-ide">12.9</a>) we’ve been steadily adding and improving support for syntax highlighting preferences in the Web IDE. These updates follow this effort and help to lay the foundation for our <a href="#dark-theme-in-the-web-ide">Dark Theme in the Web IDE</a>, also launching in 13.0. We’re excited to continue to expand on developer experience and making the Web IDE feel more like home.</p>

<p>When there are a lot of discussion threads on a design it can be hard to identify which thread relates to which comment pin on the design without scanning for the correct comment number.</p>
<p>In 13.0, we added a mechanism to highlight the relevant design discussion comment pin when you click on the comment. We also added the reverse where you can click on the comment pin and have the relevent comment scroll into view. This reduces manual scrolling and sifting through the noise when you have lots of comment pins.</p>

<p>A JUnit report can contain a wealth of information that can be used to update test plans, test execution history, and other artifacts which teams use to track the quality of their code. Updating those artifacts can be a painful, manual, process made worse by the fact that JUnit reports are only available to download from the GitLab UI.
Starting in GitLab 13.0 users of the GitLab API will be able to access JUnit reports directly. This will enable users to parse JUnit data to create new issues or <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/issues/387">update test execution history</a>.</p>

Setting to allow Deploy tokens to read and write to the GitLab Package Registry
</h3>

<p>Deploy Tokens allow you to access your group’s repositories, project’s repositories, and container registries. Historically, the defined scopes of <code>read_repository</code>, <code>read_registry</code>, and <code>write_registry</code> have not allowed you to grant access to the GitLab Package Registry. As a result, DevOps teams have used insecure or expensive user-based workarounds.</p>
<p>In GitLab 13.0, we are excited to announce more granular permissions for GitLab Deploy Tokens. You can now set read or write access for the Package Registry. You can also create and manage Deploy Tokens from within the GitLab application or by using the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deploy_tokens.html">API</a>.</p>

<p>The GitLab Package Registry has been treating each new version of a package as a <em>new</em> package. This has made it difficult to find the package you are looking for or to understand what has changed from version to version.</p>
<p>In GitLab 13.0, we are excited to announce that each version of a package will now be nested under its uniquely-named parent. This will make it easier to find the package you are looking for in the UI and to better understand what has changed from version to version. This change applies to both the group and project-level views of the Package Registry. In addition, when using the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html">Packages API</a>, versions will now be returned as an array within the parent package.</p>

<p>When you or someone on your team publishes an image to the GitLab Container Registry, you need a way to quickly find it and ensure the image was built properly. If you’re using GitLab CI/CD to publish images with each build, it’s been very difficult to find an image efficiently within the current user interface. Instead, you’ve relied on the command line or the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#list-registry-repository-tags">API</a>.</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that in 13.0, we’ve added search functionality to the GitLab Container Registry. Simply navigate to your project or group’s registry and enter an image name to see a list of all your images.</p>

<p>GitLab 13.0 updates our <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/">Secret Detection Security Scanning</a> to support a new configuration variable (<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/#full-history-secret-scan"><code>SAST_GITLEAKS_HISTORIC_SCAN</code></a>) to allow scanning the full history of a repository. This allows you to identify historical secrets that might be hiding in your older git commit history. Since introduction in <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/03/22/gitlab-11-9-released/#detect-secrets-and-credentials-in-the-repository">GitLab 11.9</a>, Secret Detection scanned the commit history of changes in a merge request. This would detect new secrets but would not identify secrets in the repository’s older git history. This new functionality is particularly useful when you are enabling Secret Detection in a repository for the first time and you want to perform a full secret scan.</p>
<p>We have created a <a href="https://youtu.be/wDtc_K00Y0A">short video walkthrough</a> showcasing how you can perform a historical secret scan via <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/schedules.html">scheduled pipeline</a> or with a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/#run-a-pipeline-manually">manual pipeline</a>.</p>

<li>Now that Puma is the <a href="#reduced-memory-consumption-of-gitlab-with-puma">default web application server</a>, with the option to still switch back to using Unicorn, the name of the Unicorn chart has changed from <code>unicorn</code> to <code>webservice</code>. For configuration details, see the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/gitlab/webservice/index.html">Charts documentation</a>.</li>
<li>The ConfigMap entries for <code>puma.rb</code> and <code>unicorn.rb</code> files have been removed in favor of environment variables. Please note that if you have modified the <code>unicorn.rb</code> from the ConfigMap (via Helm + Kustomize) in the past, you will be impacted by this change. We are doing this to eliminate maintaining two copies of these files. Until now, the <code>puma.rb</code> and <code>unicorn.rb</code> files were static within the <code>gitlab-webservice</code> container and overwritten by ConfigMap items from the <code>gitlab/unicorn</code> chart. For details on the new environment variables, refer to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG/-/merge_requests/430">the associated merge request</a>.</li>

Geo secondaries automatically forward SSH requests for unsynchronized repositories
</h3>

<p>Geo supports <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/configuration.html#selective-synchronization">selective
synchronization</a>
of projects, which allows systems administrators to choose a subset of
data that is replicated to a secondary Geo node. Geo already supports
redirecting HTTP(S) requests to the primary when trying to access these
unsynchronized repositories. However, users trying to access
unsynchronized repositories on a secondary node via SSH would receive an
error that the repository was not available. This was confusing for
users and forced them to either wait for the repository to synchronize
or do extra work to connect to the right repository.</p>
<p>In GitLab 13.0, any Git requests made via SSH to an unsynchronized
secondary Geo node will be forwarded to the primary node. This results
in a much more seamless user experience because users won’t need to know
what is or isn’t replicated to this node - Geo will fulfill the request
both via HTTP(S) and SSH without any additional configuration.</p>

<p>This important addition to audit events corrects a gap in nonrepudiation for your compliance program and adds to the reliability and comprehensiveness of your GitLab audit events data.</p>

Value Stream Analytics | Lead time, cycle time metrics
</h3>

<p>Two key value stream metrics now give teams a baseline against which process improvement efforts may be measured so that they may more easily see the impact of process changes. Lead time measures the elasped time between a requested item and its delivery. Cycle time measures the length of the development cycle itself. By optimizing flow across the entire value stream, teams avoid moving a problem from one place to another and ship faster.</p>

<p>As a first step toward a more frictionless solution, we have enabled Group Export in the GitLab UI. We plan to introduce similar <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211807">Import functionality</a> to the UI within the next few weeks.</p>

Since then, we’ve considered our users who are designing products as individual contributors and, in 13.0, we’re excited to announce we’ve moved these two features down to GitLab Core! This aligns with our <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#buyer-based-tiering-clarification">Individual Contributor Buying Model</a> and we expect to add other great team features in the future, like approvals, as we progress towards category maturity.</p>

With this editor, users will benefit from basic code completion and linting for some languages. We’ve also improved source code language detection for better syntax highlighting, and added support for all our <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/preferences.html#syntax-highlighting-theme">syntax highlighting themes</a>. These improvements will make it easier to edit and collaborate on Snippets.</p>
<p>We’re excited to bring consistency to the editors in Snippets and the Web IDE.

WYSIWYG for the Static Site Editor
</h3>

<p>Markdown is a powerful and efficient syntax for authoring web content, but even seasoned authors of Markdown content can struggle to remember some of the less-frequently used formatting options or write even moderately-complex tables from scratch. There are some jobs better accomplished with a rich text, “What You See Is What You Get” (WYSIWYG) editor.</p>
<p>GitLab 13.0 brings a WYSIWYG Markdown authoring experience to the Static Site Editor with formatting options for common formatting options like headers, bold, italics, links, lists, blockquotes, and code blocks. The WYSIWYG editor also removes the onerous task of editing tables in Markdown by letting you visually edit table rows, columns and cells in the same way you would edit a spreadsheet. For those more comfortable writing in raw Markdown, there’s even a tab for switching between WYSIWYG and plain text editing modes.</p>

<p>Merge Request Approvals require specific people to approve changes before they can be merged.

you previously approved using the new <strong>Approved-By</strong> filter.</p>

<p>Groups can be used for organizing users in GitLab. This makes it easy to share projects,
mention in comments, or assign as merge request approvers without selecting them one at a time.</p>
<p>Groups and users can be assigned as code owners, but ancestor groups could not be used.
This meant assigning a parent group from the project hierarchy as a code owner had no effect.</p>
<p>GitLab 13.0 introduces the ability to include users and groups from a parent or ancestor group in a
project’s <code>CODEOWNERS</code> file, providing more flexibility when specifying Code Owners’
rules.</p>

Now, you can view and download your project or group’s PyPI packages and reference metadata to validate that the package was built properly. You can also quickly copy setup and install commands for more efficient sharing and coding. If the package was built using a GitLab pipeline, you’ll be able to view and link it to the pipeline, as well as the commit that was used to publish the package.</p>

<p>To determine what needs to be replicated from the primary, Geo compares the tracking database to the read-only secondary database. If Geo’s

Uploads</a>, thereby
eliminating the possibility of database statement timeouts. We also

Objects, and Uploads when these files are stored

Removal of deprecated project paths
</h3>
<p>With the introduction of <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/05/22/gitlab-13-0-released/subgroups">subgroups</a>, GitLab’s URL path structure became more complex. We’ve been <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214217">introducing a separator</a>, <code>/-/</code>, to improve clarity between groups, projects, and pages within a project. For example, <code>https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues</code> is now <code>https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues</code>. These changes result in improved performance, stability, and simplicity.</p>
<p>As we introduce the separator to additional pages, we automatically redirect requests to the old paths to the new ones. With GitLab 13.0, we are <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26808">removing this redirect</a> for pages which have had the separator since GitLab 12.0.</p>
<p>Regular usage of GitLab will not be impacted by this change. However bookmarks or scripting created over a year ago, utilizing an affected path, will need to be updated to utilize the new path.</p>

ways of starting Sidekiq in favor of Sidekiq Cluster. Sidekiq Cluster provides additional options for managing Sidekiq queues and scaling.</p>
<p>This enables <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/extra_sidekiq_processes.html#starting-multiple-processes">running multiple Sidekiq processes</a>

Auto DevOps' default PostgreSQL version is changing
</h3>
<p>As part of updating Auto DevOps in GitLab 12.9 to support
Kubernetes 1.16, we added the opt-in ability for Auto DevOps to use the
PostgreSQL chart version 8.2.1. The default PostgreSQL chart version in
GitLab 12.10 is currently 0.7.1. GitLab 13.0 switches the default
PostgreSQL chart version from 0.7.1 to 8.2.1. To remain on the old
default version, you must explicitly set the
<code>AUTO_DEVOPS_POSTGRES_CHANNEL</code> CI variable to <code>1</code>.
To migrate your existing 0.7.1 PostgreSQL database to the newer
8.2.1-based database, follow the
<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/upgrading_postgresql.html">upgrade guide</a>
to backup your database, install the new version of PostgreSQL, and
restore your database.</p>

Removal of logs view from the admin dashboard
</h3>
<p>Logs can no longer be viewed from within GitLab admin dashboard. These logs
used to be read directly from disk to be displayed in the admin
interface. Sadly, this does not work in multi-node setups and
could cause confusion for administrators by displaying partial
information. The logs are still available to administrators with
access to the host, please see <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/logs.html#log-system">the documentation on our log
system</a>
for more information. For multi-node systems we recommend ingesting
the logs into services like Elasticsearch and Splunk.</p>

Planned deprecation of variables SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_PREFIX and DS_ANALYZER_IMAGE_PREFIX in Secure CI Templates
</h3>
<p>To help streamline and simplify the setup of <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#security-scanning-tools">GitLab Security Tools</a>, we have introduced a new global variable <code>SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX</code> which by default points at the GitLab registry. This variable replaces the now deprecated variables in SAST and Dependency scanning: <code>SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_PREFIX</code> and <code>DS_ANALYZER_IMAGE_PREFIX</code>. Support for these deprecated variables will be removed in a future release, so please migrate any usage to <code>SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX</code>.
You can <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#override-the-default-registry-base-address">override this variable</a> to easily affect all security scanners at once. This is useful in situations where you are using your own registry images which is common in offline and air-gapped environments.</p>

Deprecation of Docker-in-Docker (DinD) for Security Scanners
</h3>
<p>To increase the security and reduce complexity of scans, use of Docker-in-Docker (DinD) in GitLab Secure scanners has been deprecated. GitLab security products will begin to use non-DinD mode by default in vendored templates in GitLab 13.0. We encourage customers to update their vendored templates to use this new behavior.
If you want to continue using DinD mode instead, see <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#enabling-docker-in-docker-for-dependency-scanning">Enabling Docker-in-Docker for Dependency Scanning</a>. In a future release we intend to remove DinD completely. Please be aware of slight <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37453">changes in scanner detection logic</a>, which we have largely mitigated.</p>

Auto DevOps and Secure Configuration templates are changing to `rules` instead of `only/except`
</h3>
<p>The use of <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#onlyexcept-basic"><code>only</code> and <code>except</code></a> is discouraged in favor of <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules"><code>rules</code></a> in Auto DevOps and Secure Configuration templates. The <code>rules</code> parameter provides more verbose and expressive job execution logic that is simpler to evaluate and easier to understand.</p>
<p>Auto DevOps and Secure <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#includetemplate">configuration templates</a> that use <code>only</code> and <code>except</code> will transition to <code>rules</code>, starting in GitLab 13.0. We strongly encourage customers who have customized job templates to transition because the <code>only/except</code> and <code>rules</code> syntax cannot be used together. For help migrating your templates, see <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#transitioning-your-onlyexcept-syntax-to-rules">Transition your <code>only/except</code> syntax to <code>rules</code></a>.</p>
<p>This change will affect the following job configuration templates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build.gitlab-ci.yml</li>
<li>Test.gitlab-ci.yml</li>
<li>Deploy.gitlab-ci.yml</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2300">Secure vendored .gitlab-ci.yml templates</a>:

<li>Container-scanning.gitlab-ci.yml</li>

<li>License-Management.gitlab-ci.yml</li>
<li>License-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml</li>
<li>SAST.gitlab-ci.yml</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any customization to Auto DevOps and Secure Configuration templates using <code>only</code> and <code>except</code> should be transitioned to the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules"><code>rules</code></a> syntax. There are occasional cases where the existing <code>only</code> and <code>except</code> syntax cannot be easily matched with <code>rules</code>. We would love to hear more about these cases on <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2783">this <code>rules</code> improvement issue</a>.</p>

SSH `authorized_keys` file deprecated
</h3>
<p>As of GitLab 13.0, the <code>bin/authorized_keys</code> file used for SSH authorization is deprecated,
replaced by <code>bin/gitlab-shell-authorized-keys-check</code>, which conducts the authorization through
<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/fast_ssh_key_lookup.html">fast lookup</a> instead.
The deprecated method wasn’t reliable as it doesn’t check that the requesting user matches
the expected user. The final removal is scheduled for GitLab 13.1, released next month (June 22nd, 2020).</p>

Removal of authorized_keys authorization for SSH
</h3>
<p>The <code>authorized_keys</code> authorization mechanism for SSH is not scalable, and is vulnerable
to race conditions and out-of-order execution issues. It also requires
a shared filesystem for most deployments of more than one machine.
[Fast lookup of authorized SSH keys] (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/fast_ssh_key_lookup.html)
solves these issues and is the recommended authorization mechanism. As such,
we are planning to make it the default mechanism starting in GitLab 14.0.</p>
<p>As we work to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212227">make fast SSH lookups the default Git+SSH authorization mechanism</a>
in GitLab, we are deprecating the <code>authorized_keys</code> mechanism, which is currently the default. We plan to make this new mechanism
work out of the box, so there is no impact or action required from GitLab users nor administrators.</p>

Planned removal of legacy storage in 14.0
</h3>
<p>GitLab currently supports two types of storage for repositories: <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/repository_storage_types.html#legacy-storage">Legacy storage</a> and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/repository_storage_types.html#hashed-storage">hashed storage</a>. Hashed storage makes the folder structure immutable and results in performance and security improvements.</p>
<p>Hashed storage has been available since GitLab 10.0 and is on by default since GitLab 12.0. GitLab.com has been fully migrated to hashed storage. With GitLab 13.0 legacy storage is deprecated and we are planning to fully remove legacy storage in 14.0.</p>
<p><strong>In 13.0:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Legacy storage is deprecated and usage is strongly discouraged. Please follow instructions on <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/raketasks/storage.html#migrate-to-hashed-storage">how to migrate fully to hashed storage</a>.</li>
<li>Administrators will no longer be able to disable hashed storage for new projects.</li>
<li>New projects and renamed projects will use hashed storage by default.</li>
<li>When renaming or moving projects they will be migrated to hashed storage automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In 13.2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upon upgrading to 13.2, all projects still in legacy storage will be automatically migrated via a background migration.</li>
<li>Some new features may require hashed storage and won’t be available when using legacy storage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In 14.0:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Legacy storage support will be completely removed from GitLab. Users must migrate to hashed storage before upgrading to 14.0.</li>

<p>In GitLab 11.11, we announced the deprecation of the Windows batch executor, Cmd shell, for the GitLab Runner in favor of PowerShell.

PowerShell is the default command shell when a new Runner is registered that uses the Windows executor starting with GitLab Runner 12.0. The Cmd shell remains included in future versions of GitLab Runner. However, any new Runner feature is to be tested and supported only for use with PowerShell.

Important notes on upgrading to GitLab 13.0
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before upgrading to GitLab 13.0, you will need to upgrade to 12.10. For more details on upgrading, see <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/#upgrading-to-a-new-major-version">Upgrading to a new major version</a>.</li>
<li>GitLab 13.0 automatically migrates all snippets, creating a repository for each one of them and also committing a file into it based on the snippet <code>file name</code> and <code>content</code>. This operation is done in a background migration, therefore no downtime is required. In case the background migration fails migrating any of the snippets, GitLab 13.0 also introduces several <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/migrate_snippets.html">rake tasks</a> to help migrating them manually.</li>
<li>PostgreSQL 11 is the minimum required version starting in GitLab 13.0. PostgreSQL 9.6 and 10 have been removed and are no longer officially supported. You will need to plan on some downtime for the PostgreSQL upgrade because the database must be down while the upgrade is performed. If you are using the GitLab-provided PostgreSQL database, your database will be automatically upgraded when you upgrade to GitLab 13.0, unless you are using HA or Geo in which case some manual steps are required. See <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrading-a-geo-instance">the Geo upgrade documentation</a> and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrading-a-gitlab-ha-cluster">HA upgrade documentation</a> for important instructions.</li>
<li>Puma is now the default web application server for GitLab. Users who have customized their Unicorn settings will need to <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/puma.html#configuring-puma-settings">manually migrate these settings to Puma</a>. Additionally installations using <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/#direct-git-access-in-gitlab-rails">Direct Git Access</a>, usually those with slower NFS drives, may want to consider <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/puma.html#performance-caveat-when-using-puma-with-rugged">running Puma single-threaded</a>. To learn more about the benefits of switching to Puma, see <a href="#reduced-memory-consumption-of-gitlab-with-puma">the Puma release note</a>. Unicorn support will be <a href="#unicorn-will-be-removed-in-favor-of-puma">removed in GitLab 14.0</a>.</li>
<li>If you are running a self-managed instance of GitLab with an external PostgreSQL database, please note that the default timeout for PostgreSQL statements that was <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released/#omnibus-improvements">added in GitLab 12.9</a> has been temporarily disabled. This was due to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5287">an issue experienced with GitLab.com</a>. The default timeout will be re-enabled when <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5255">the proposed change in implementation has been added</a>.</li>
<li>If you have a self-managed instance of GitLab and are using the Mattermost integration, please note that a schema change was made in the Mattermost database to fix performance issues with emoji reactions. As a result of the schema change, you may experience longer upgrade times if your Mattermost database contains a lot of emoji reactions. See <a href="https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/important-upgrade-notes.html">the Mattermost upgrade documentation</a> for the recommended approach to upgrading.</li>
<li>The Redis configuration has been changed in 13.0 to replace the <code>slave</code> terminology with <code>replica</code>, and the Redis version was updated to 5.0.9. These change require a restart of Redis. If you are using Redis HA, follow the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/48907">Redis HA updgrade steps</a> to upgrade without downtime. If you are running Redis on a single node, you will need to plan on Redis being in accessbile while it restarts.</li>
