  <p>kasparov in 64kb. i don't like 3d-flyby-stuff, but this is actually amazing. along with heaven7, the demo err intro of the year i'd say.</p>

  <p>Guys, you kick asses !<br>
You pushed again the limits !</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c1730">
  <p>Using 3D API DLL's like BIOS, is it correct? Where are limits? What is realy 64kB intro under Windows infrastructure?</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c1731">
  <div><p>argh. please.</p><p>

if these comments continue, we may have to a dos lores softwarerendering version, just to prove that we do NOT use any hidden windows object generators or packing techniques. really. the only thing fr-08 uses is plain d3d for polygon drawing - nothing more, nothing less.</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c1749">
  <p>&lt;please insert all kasparov' demo comments here&gt; + &lt;some emphasis&gt;<br>

</div>
<div id="c1750">
  <div><p>Kicks ass, the music roqs, the visuals roq and the design isn't bad at all. Intro of the year in my opinion (even better than Heaven7).</p><p>

On the bigscreen at TP it roqed even more, from the beginning on people sat there with open mouthes. Could have won the demo-compo as well.</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c1753">
  <div><p>This intro rock!!!<br>
Intro of the year. Farbraush did a very good work.</p><p>

Bon je vais avoir du boulot pour en faire autant (meme dans mes reves:)</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c1754">
  <p>ehrm.. this intro really kicks ass :)<br>
Maybee some effects to next time? ;) But anyways.. This intro is the best i've seen so far.. Nice music, Nice 3dscenes, and excellent textures! :)<br>
For a demo it might be considered booring... but for a 64kb.. NOOP! :)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c1790">
  <div><p>this prod is incredibly well done.<br>
never been _that_ stunned from anything else after clicking an .exe file<br>
and i really clicked a whole bunch of'em already ;)</p><p>

lllove the well-synched-music, btw!</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c1917">
  <p>I ran it, saw a preloader bar while hearing shitty music. Anyway, i didn't care. Let's wait. Then the intro begins. Some 3d, good meshes, very good textures, good animation, no glitches. The *real* music starts as well. Good samples, good bassline. Everything's fine! The demo goes on and on and on. Will it ever stop? A scene, another, yet another, every time new scene, new objects, new all. Finally, the scroller. As usual, i wait longer than when they say 'press escape', and see that the demo continues. I couldn't say how long it lasts, but i'm pretty sure you could use that exe as a screen saver. Everything in this demo is great: music, textures, meshes, code, it runs smoothly, fast.<br>
I finally pressed escape. Get back to my unzip program. AAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!! IT IS AN IN64K!!!! How could they place all that stuff in such a small file? Really, see it!!! I urge you to see it!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c1919">
  <p>The most boring intro of the year. Above-average music, few minutes of editing in DemoPaia that probably did most of the generating, powerful packer and ... nothing else yet. Das produkt is an typical example of making a mistake by forgetting the sence of a product by nothing else than all 3d scene, fly-path making. When I saw this for the first time, I was no doubt surpriced, but for the second time bored and for the third time disgusted. There's no point of it - all Farb-Rausch want to say is "hey, look what we managed to do, look how we managed to compress some (no matter how fool) heap of 3d stuff!" <br>
Do you think you wouldn't forget this intro after some 5 years? Really? It's really foolish trying to compare this intro with Heaven 7/exceed, 'cause it's uncomparable. In general, this newskool intro shows nothing else than flying by simply generated objects they are STATIC (ok, few of them moves artificialy, up and down or left and right) and is nothing else than a boring trip of "cold" 3d scenes. I don't claim I could code something like Das Produkt, I just say it's an "eye-popping intro (according to today) with absolutely no sence".</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c1928">
  <p>one of the best releases 2000. the texture-generator must be awesome, as is the sample generator engine. farbrausch have done a great job.</p>

  <div><p>64KB ????? Unbeliveable!!</p><p>

Sehr gute Arbeit - weiter so!!!!!</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c1957">
  <p>I agree with crs... The size is impressive (great job !), but that's all. There is no creativity.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c1982">
  <p>yeah, i like it and it's very rare when i say i like a demo/intro/dentro because i have see more than 2000 demos in 10 years of scene. This intro is one of the best intro ever made in computerdemoscene. Continue dudes, you rules :)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c2060">
  <div><p>Hallo! Das ist sehr gut! Wunderbar!!! Heh,. hab ich ihnen gesagt, dass ich Deutsch sprechen kann? :)</p><p>

Ohh,.. und sie durfen nicht sagen, dass mein Deutsch furctbar klingt! ;)</p><p>

Translation:</p><p>

This is wunderbar. I would like very much to do one of this, but I am just a lame newbie who whines everyday and says how much happy he is around the world. Am I right? :)</p><p>

People say that Germans are the technicall people who just do pure tech, not desing,. but I just love them! Heh.. I hope you love me too guyz =)</p><p>

Crazy Optimus<br>
P.S.1 Useless Fact: Do you remember if you write me email, that I answer with "Hallo" and not "Hello"? Yes! In the beginning I was just confused, but then I kept it because I love German sceners a lot! Just an obssesion? Heh =)</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c2067">
  <div><p>ok... First the guy who wanted to "penetrate" us on c.s.i.p.d ... now Optimus who confesses that he's in love with us...</p><p>

I just think if it wouldn't be better for us to, uh... cover our asses *g*</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c2137">
  <div><p>crs, are you saying that if they put in some particles and some poetry with bad english, you'd like this intro more? And of course there's a point to it! You don't make something like this for no reason! It will be well remembered, just like Stash (you didn't forget Stash, DID YOU?! :) If you can't be impressed by code, then you're missing out on half the value of demos.</p><p>

the product and Heaven 7 both kick ass - let's all just agree with that. :)</p><p>

p.s. since when did it become "das produkt"? (german name, i know) I was searching for "fr-08" in the prods list and was shocked to find nothing there. :)</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c2240">
  <p>nothing can beat heaven7 ... anyway i've not scene yet das produkt ... :Ãž<br>
</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c2349">
  <p>ok, i've just watched the product, and i keep on saying that nothing can beat h7 :)<br>
but anyway this is a matter of state, and besides that, the product is truely one of the best intros/demos _ever_ ...</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c2420">
  <div><p>I agree all round here, FR-08 could do with a little more life in it's scenes, but it shouldn't have the stoopid "poetry" and strange overlaid effects/particles etc.</p><p>

The demo is roughly 11 minutes long, and I enjoy it better than Kasparov. (that robot at the end annoys me)</p><p>

Keep going Farb-Rausch, You've got talent, and lots of it! :D</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c2421">
  <div><p>really incredible what people can squeeze out of 64kb.</p><p>

i really enjoy this intro and know many people (even non-demoscene) who enjoy it.</p><p>

keep up the amazing work.</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c2461">
  <div><p>this is very good. technically it's amazing. and yes, it's also artistic and creative. i can't see why it wouldn't be.</p><p>

it's not my favourite intro. it's not even on my top ten list. <br>
but it is impressive. <br>
there's a huge amount of talent behind this, and i see it as extremely unfair to claim it's 'not creative'.</p><p>

but no, i'm not so much into the style.</p><p>

but i definately don't miss the 'poetry', the flat shaded boxes, etc.<br>
ingredients that some ppl seem to believe automatically makes an intro (or a demo) 'more artistic'. haha.  </p><p>

that's all i had to say.</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c2622">
  <div><p>It's the best 64K demo I have ever seen since Hplus/Halcyon !</p><p>

But when the scroller comes, I think it becomes a little bit too long...</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c2764">
  <p>very cool 64k demo with very cool gfx, music and code (and also very cool sceners who done this??? ;))</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c2847">
  <div><p>ok, let's gain one another flÃ¶p :-S,</p><p>

by my very private opinion (that i don't force to you nor anybody) it's not right to do an intro by letting editing some easy-to-generate objects in some 3d editor, define some splines for the camera to move around, include a sinewave generator, reuse (or write your own) some demopacker... and than think it's a VALUEABLE production.</p><p>

This rather "coder-oriented" demo-making might have sence in 128B to 4KB cathegory, but in 64KB it is supposed some idea to fit in.</p><p>

I think demoscene is rather art (or some kind of a computer art) than a "technology" or how would you name that. According to this point of view, release of "das produkt" is as interesting as an... invetion of an air brush (but it IS interesting, i don't deny. at least at the technological point of view. Technological advance that has meaning for today, not for tomorrow).</p><p>

By the way, i didn't say this is not creative, it would be "not creative" so that farb rausch didn't do das product at all. But that's a "creativity" coder - technician's attitude. By my whole opinion what is substantial not to miss in making an intro is filling up (or just trying to fill up) a "spirit" of it. Not just to put some part or devices to a mixer and mix it together, wishing an idea will fall from a sky and incorporate to the production.</p><p>

phoenix: trying to fill the intro with some poetry (just for "the effect") is a same (or even bigger) stupidity as building it from a pieces like a cube-castle. This has no sence. You must feel it, you must know "this suits there and this not". Then you are on a good way to do a intro with sence.</p><p>

"_": i still disagree das product is contributive for the scene (from an artistic point of view) or it is even artistic.</p><p>

syntig, a REALLY good and cool intro (BMHO) stays cool even if you play it for example twenty times or even more. Have you tried it? Just try!</p><p>

ps. i would like to know, what is the opinion of farb rausch members. please, do tell me, criticize me, shout on me, anything you want.. :-)</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c2916">
  <div><p>Forst of all, i disagree totally that also 64Ks are now completely in the hands of so-called "designers" or "artists" - 65536 bytes are still a f***ing hard limit, and if you want to say that you aren't impressed by anything technical, well, the Shockwave/Flash scene is wide open for you. Or go work at some ad agency, or anything else, but the demo scene has always been for showing off skills, be it those of coders, musicians, or graphicians, and I DO hope this will never change.<br>
Even for full-size demos, this should be the fact again... there are so many well-designed demos which i can't watch because it's made by guys with a nice feeling for design, but not even the most basic skills you'd need for doing flat shading. And IMO, this does suck.</p><p>

And the fact that also 64k demos are rated only by their "artistic" level (as if any of them would reach a level which real "artists" wouldn't laugh at) does quite scare me off.</p><p>

Then, what is "artistic" ?</p><p>

I don't want to say, that I consider FR08 that much of an artistic demo, no, the scenes definitely don't fit together, the music was done quite in a hurry without letting me getting used to the synth and its possibilities, and our general mood at the end was something like "ok, let's shock the scene a bit, we've enough time to do a GOOD intro thereafter"..</p><p>

... but who the f*** does define that thisandthat is art and other things are not?</p><p>

Why can't the way the camera moves be artistic and thoughtful? Many (99%) of those "considered art" demos have camera movements which fly around the object, and fly around, and then fly around them, without any sense, somewhere in the senseless gap between "no real camera operator would so something silly like that" and "nah, for a special effect it's just too boring". But still, FR08 (and also Kasparov eg.) are considered "boring 3D flybys", even if their camera movements have NOTHING in common with most of the rest of the demos. </p><p>

Look at the completely overrated "Purple" by Orion eg. Does it have a story? No, sorry, if i remove the texts, i have 3D flybys of the most boring and senseless kind, some mediocre music, but hey, let's put some texts about an enslaved civilisation below them and soon everybody thinks it's "art" and doesn't even recognize that this handfull of polygons doesn't run in a sufficient speed with GeForce DDR and 256 Megs of RAM. That's cool. Art is the perfect disguise for lack of skills and creativity.</p><p>

crs, it's perfectly ok that you dislike FR08, it's ok if it doesn't give anything to you, but don't try to define what's "art" here - and don't try to define what's important for the scene and what isn't, ok?</p><p>

So, enough of flaming, now let's all go back to work and produce some creative, stunning, artsy cutting-ende demos and intros for MS2001, thanks :)</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c2931">
  <p>Dammit, people, just be impressed by this intro and stop arguing about its artistic value, okay? :)<br>
</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c2934">
  <p>good textures, good meshes, and 64k!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c2957">
  <div><p>This is so hot it should be classified as hardcore pr0n. </p><p>

However I think that enough has been said about the visuals. I'll rant about the sound synthesis. It is good, real good. Leech the intro, fire it up and close your eyes, listen to it and keep thinking "ooooooh mama! it's a 64Kb intro". Then do it again but this time with your eyes open for the full effect. </p><p>

Make sure your keyboard is safe from potential drooling.</p></div>

  <p>hums.. i guess i can read.. i just cant stand this multimedish webpages.. sorry ;p</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c3337">
  <p>I think the main problem with this production (same with kasparov actually) is that technically it is so good in all aspects, (good in the sense of well-crafted) that you can't help but beeing disappointed by the lack of ideas and emptyness of the production. You see, the individual elements makes you expect more than just an aggregation of cool things together. And that's were it is failing. Contrast that to the good 'design' demos which are worth more than the individual parts they are made of. </p>
  
</div>
<div id="c3396">
  <p>this intro is a piece of ART, a demo in 64k really, impressive is all i can say, technically brilliant ... if you have not seen the product, go watch it NOW!<br>
the facts at the scroller are a bit exagerated but nonetheless it is unbelivable what these guys have done with 65535 bytes ...<br>
if only they did proper D3D initialization :)<br>
oh well ... did i mention that you MUST see this intro ?<br>
</p>

  <p>looks impressive, and technically it's incredible, but it's also incredibly boring to watch. zzzzzzz.</p>

  <p>A RAD 64k intro...A must see...Damn it..i wish i had seen it on the bigscreen...Just watch it...nothing else<br>
</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c3650">
  <div><p>By definition i am against this kind of intro. It is everything i stand against. 1) Texture genereation - have done before. 2) Object generation - have done before. 3) Software synths - have done before. 4) Graphical script-language - have demo before. 5) Nice code - have done before.</p><p>

The only thing this demo really excellents in is the fact that FR succeeded in making a commercial breakthrough for the demoscene. They showed us that commercial egoism and self-partrism pays --- if you want to win at The Party. <br>
I must confess that the they have put a lot of effort into the actual production of this keyframed and low designed intro, but the music suits the rest. (Thats about the only positive comment i can come with here, and I am not going to comment on FR's MS's demo wich was worse than a cow's shit)</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c3653">
  <div><p>erm, sorry macaw, but i still don't accept your points.</p><p>

your intros usually feature slow/ambient music (has been done before), 3d objects (have been done before) and some code/sync (has been done before), plus some design (has been done before)</p><p>

with this attitude you can argument that every 64k intro sucks - because they usually don't feature things that haven't been done in demos. argumenting this way is simply bullshit.</p><p>

why don't you simply say ONCE "ok, let's make it short, i hate any kind of 3d flyby" and be done with it instead of coming up with this ridicilous argumentation AGAIN? :)</p><p>

agree on fr-012 tho :)</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c3772">
  <div><p>A fatass "WELL DONE!", guys. The graphics, the code, the music... it goes hand in hand like homegrown w33d. If this where the early 90:s i would definitive call u "ZuPerELiTe"!</p><p>

Seriously... very good work on the soft synth. The best introsoftsynth i've ever tasted.<br>
...i think everything in this intro... how should i put it... SUPERB!</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c3810">
  <p>crap design, fairly crap textures, but the sound is nice and at it certainly inspired people to start releasing again. which is nice. so kudos :)</p>

  <p>allready posted a comment before but it would be shame not to vote for this awesome demo</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c3916">
  <p>yes, this is s really impressive intro, the music is great, and the textures and models are really nice but it gets really boring after a while, nothing special happens.. it is the same thing for 15minutes or so..</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c3936">
  <div><p>damn. i really hate this intro, cuz:<br>
1) it has music - have done before.<br>
2) it has graphics - have done before.<br>
3) it was coded - have done before.</p><p>

macaw wtf you been taking?</p></div>

  <p>great music, the best I've heard been done with a software synth. pretty impressive, but there isn't much design, so it gets a bit boring after a while...</p>

  <p>Simply Astonishing. Overcoming fr-08 it will be hard :) <br>
Mmmh ... we could put a bit of generateGorgeousDancingPlaymate function ;)<br>

and I'm very impressed by the rest of the coding as well..</p><p>

could have been better if it wasn't so much 3d-flyby, but don't take me wrong, I really love this production. </p><p>

for those who complain about this isn't hard to do, well, do something better to prove it!</p><p>

and macaw, nice code has been done before? what the hell are you talking about? should we stop coding, or should we stop writing "nice code" and write terrible code instead?</p><p>

oh well, just would love to see another 64kb by farbrausch... keep up the great work guys!</p><p>

Not for those who want to show a flat-cube (+poetic nonsense) in 3 fps/h. </p>
  
</div>
<div id="c5011">
  <div><p>quite impressive how much datas they have compressed into the small file.<br>
except of the nice coding work this production is similar to the rest of the farbrausch stuff - acceptable gfx,no story, no design, ... and no reason to watch it more than 1 time.<br>
get heaven7 instead its better at ... everything.</p></div>

How long before Intel have Chaos assassinated?</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c5152">
  <div><p>first some destructive criticism:</p><p>

bad code - ha - even i could do better. not to speak about someone who actually knows about d3d/ogl.<br>
bad scenes - where are all your lights? looks pretty pale to me.. colors have "coder-look" in them too.<br>
bad design - no balls no design. luckily no sgeneboetry. phew.<br>
bad music - it just hypnotizes people to think there's something massive going on when there ain't.</p><p>

so there. points that few have come up with yet.</p><p>

and to the bad news:</p><p>

i just haven't seen a better accelerated "non-alternative" intro yet. (havent watched many lately tho) (note nz cmc v10f fr09 etc don't belong to this group we're comparing things in)</p><p>

...ps. there's nothing weird in an intro that could win a democompo - that is the way it should be. </p></div>

  <div><p>Hmf... the compression? GOOD</p><p>

  <p>what compression?? it is all generated (afaik)</p>

</div>
<div id="c5246">
  <p>this intro rulez! 64ko...<br>
but a lot of 2d effects is missing, it will be more fun.</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c5402">
  <p>great soundtrack, it's incredible how they managed to keep the size down to 64k! it was a really great idea to do a website totaly dedicated to the intro.    good work indeed</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c5487">
  <p>first off: this is not an intro. it's a full-fledged demo, in only 64kb. packing the music alone to 64 kbytes is hard to imagine possible - it sounds more like a 3-4 mbytes .ogg-file! impressive.<br>
the graphics are incredibly well done considering there're no pre-rendered images or textures, and the "achtung!"-sign in one of the scenes clearly shows the farbrausch guys' eye for detail. once more - impressive! on the other hand, the storyboard is a bit dull. some variation would've been nice, but we really shouldn't ask for too much. i mean, this demo is still breathtaking, why would we need any more?<br>
</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c5488">
  <div><p>dragonfly, guess you havn't visited fr webpage</p><p>

because then you'd know this:</p><p>

the music is not 'packed', it's pre-generated using kb's (realtime?) softsynth, fully capable of doing all kinds of german'ish techno-boomboom sounds (isnt that right kb?) :)</p><p>

some of the more realistic-looking textures are indeed pre-made, done by hand if you will, and then packed using homemade compression-routines, the rest of the simple textures are generated (kb/ryg - am i right?)</p><p>

btw, i actually enjoyed watching this intro about 4 or 5 times before it started to bore me :) </p><p>

still it's quite an impressive piece of work</p><p>

oh for you non-musicians out there, not only did kb code the softsynth, he actually managed to create 'everything' you hear in fr08 in it. (kb - i fear your viruz2snare :))</p><p>

ok enough licking ass, great work guys, keep it up</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c5506">
  <div><p>none of the textures is premade and then compressed. the original fr-08 code is not capable of storing image data (except the windows-icon). actually, that's what makes the product special: all the textures are generated, even those that look like photoshop.</p><p>

and the music is not "pre-generated", it's realtime generated. sucks a lot of processor time, but since the demo is designed for G-Force, that does not really matter. (well, it runs great on non T&amp;L cards as well...). </p><p>

all the precalculating is needed for generating the textures and models. that's why we play that "elevator music", to show that kb's synthesiser does not need any precalculation (actually it is incapable of playing samples of any kind), and to make it less boring to watch that progress bar. we feared that it would take 30-60 seconds, but on most modern pc's, it less than ten.</p><p>

the current version of the intro system can store images and mp3's. i used this in "ahh" and "atomic erotic", but the code for that was made long after fr-08 and is not optimised for intros.</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c5573">
  <div><p>ah ok, i must've got the wrong impression from your site/and from chatting with kb on irc .. </p><p>

but now im wiser :)</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c5673">
  <p>i guess there's nothing special in only having generated-only textures its just a matter of what you need to store... everything is based on the question: "do i store the result of my actions or the actions i did themselves?" that's what flash is made of and well before that that's what the old vecto-paint tool were made of (even .xm vs .mp3 if you think of it with an extension of samples)... this furthermore allows for very interesting effects like texture zooming and stuff without the bilinear loss... i suppose stash had one fully stored texture with buddha figure but that's because either it was a scan (so no stroke to be recorded) or storing these stroke was eavier than compressing the picture itself but that's another subject. anyway the produkt is quite cool just boring but cool, i love the music and the neat feeling of perfectly finished stuff it gives.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c5674">
  <p>ooops... yeah and for all the coders who are wondering how it is possible to make these fancy sounds just go download mame sourcecode there's plenty of psg, fm &amp; misc. synthetizer emulated in it.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c5679">
  <div><p>thanks to your comments, but vector-painting like flash has nothing to do with what we did in the product. just look at the textures on www.theproduct.de. and we had this "its nothing new or special" discussion long ago, so please don't start it again.</p><p>

oh, and why aren't you posting under your real name? you created the "x" account today and the two comments above are your only comments you ever made. (this is not the first time this happened)</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c5696">
  <div><p>I have been following the scene even before it was known as "the scene", and I must say excellent work guys, in my opinion the product is one of the greatest intros or demos ever made. But I'm sure you were aware of that already.</p><p>

Especially the quality of the synthesizer impressed me. Inspiring, makes me want to produce demos again. </p><p>

The Product has made me happy.</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c5699">
  <p>because my real name is x from xbarr and it's the first comment i write here. that's the why and the only one. and for flash stuff yep it's exactly the same basic underlying concept recording actions versus recording result to get the smallest file possible no matter what the result looks like... that's why even xm can be regarded as using the same *compression* technic in comparison with wav rm mp3 wich are fully rendered streams compressed with a generic algorithm. xm could be regarded as the best compression possible in a way or more exactly in the smallest raw representation of a music, a serie of notes... since you don't want any further discussion/sharing on compression stuff i'll just quit now. that's the oldskool way (it's my code don't you look over my shoulder or i'll put a box over my head and my monitor [i still wonder who this funky coder was] d:) and i quite agree with it.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c5735">
  <div><p>if XM was the ultimate compression technology, how come nobody has ever put an 11 minutes long near-studio sound quality tune into 4K of data using FT2?</p><p>

Sorry, couldn't resist :)</p></div>
  
</div>

<div id="c5814">
  <p>first of all i never heard 11 sec of near-studio quality sound in 4k neither in 5 meg... no offence but bring on voices guitars real drums and stuff in 4k, nobody needs a studio to make techno and you know that better than me (;. and as i correct it xm is no compression it's just a clever way to store a music (when it's possible to do and when blahblah and stuff and yes sometime you have to use streams but also if then and maybe then so... you see what i mean)... anyway...</p>

  <p>The texture quality of a demo and Reproduction time of Demo are wonderful at 64k-intro.<br>
Was a very surprise.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c7565">
  <div><p>If there is one section where this intro wins, it's controversy! :-)</p><p>

It's actually very simple: Technology / coding oriented people will LOVE this intro. No bugs, the 3D scenes are very good with no apparent problems and the textures are  clean and crispy. Also, the music is quite good. Putting all that in 64KB only is just plain impossible!</p><p>

Art / design guys will probably admit the tech breakthrough but will also never stop complaining that the intro is long and boring, that there is not a concept, a story, a feeling.</p><p>

So it all comes down to the kind of scener you are, and that's it. I personally like it. Saw it on the big screen for the 1st time and I had to keep my jaw from falling on the floor. :-) No, it's not better that H7. But, it's a well made production, lots of work has been put to it and I think it's always going to be impressive in terms of size. So it gets my thumbs up! :-)</p></div>

  <div><p>so, now where is the hidden part? i tried to find it, and the only thing i could find was a text 'kaozrula' (very funny) and 'the simple rule of this game is that you control the bomb'.</p><p>

however check out the following keys during the demo:</p><ul><br>
<li> 'a' - rewind a few secs<br>
</li><li> 's' - forward a few secs<br>
</li><li> 'f' - toggle fast-forward mode<br>

  <div><p>the product is too boring for you? no problem! just press 'f' and it's 5 times faster! unfortunatly, music sync is lost, but who cares. so crv, x, nudge and moT, this should wipe away all your evil critics! </p><p>

skipping backwards unfortunatly does not work properly, and 'kaozrula' is a mark used by the generator tool to paste the data into the right position of the compiled executable. hmmm. thats longword aligned self-glorification.</p><p>

oh, and all this can not really be considered to be a hidden part.</p><p>

the keys work for fr-011 and fr-minus-02 too, plus the TAB key which enables the performance meter in these. unfortunatly fr-minus-02 is very buggy but i lost the source. </p></div>

  <p>boring but fucking respectable.</p>

  <div><p>heheh, no ofcourse i don't assume that to be the hidden part. i was just wondering if there is one at all... :)<br>
and: don't we all just use self-glorification? i remember our random generator routine always used 'AYS!' as initial seed :)</p><p>

hey chaos, keep on coding. according to what i saw on the website, you probably spent more time coding the generator tool than on a whole demo. respect for that one!</p></div>

  <p>The scenes are boring. The scenes are boring. The scenes are boring. I'll say that again. The scenes are boring. However, KB's ruling soundtrack saves the day. I still can't believe he pumped that much out of his share of the allotted 64k. It's not H7 but nonetheless a BIG thumbs up, Farbrausch! (next time, put a little extra into the scenes like eg. Hplus did and you should have a (bigger) killer :)</p>

  <div><p>I thought everyone's entitled to a personal opinion? How could we know if a prod is 'better' when noone's allowed to say something about it?</p><p>

By the way, when you see someone say his mind about a demo and give it a thumbs up, they enjoyed what they saw. They certainly weren't bashing anything.</p></div>

If only the intro/demo itself lived up the the music's potential. I think this could have been achieved with a bit more audio impact and syncing.</p><p>

Kasparov does a great job of this but fr08 doesn't (imho) which is probably why it gives the impression of a quake-level replayer ;)</p><p>

  <div><p>Ok.. kb .. you're the same kb I've been talking in the past in #trax ? =) .. now.. what's wrong with the flash scene? =).. there's much coding involved in flash as well.. and since the medium here is the web and size DOES matter, the flashers (well.. at least the ones who respect their audience) try to keep the filesizes to the absolute minimums.. instead of drawing a movement.. code it with actionscript and the like.</p><p>

Anyhow.. on the demo now.. there's not much I can say.. except maybe that it is a reference demo.. it's the definite choice for me when someone asks me "what is a demo".. this.. and the "this is" demo by orion.</p><p>

I've probably watched it some hundred times now. still amazing, still brilliant.it's something about the mood that really make this intro rock. The part inside the church/chapel (?) is beautiful, both because of the scene and the music. Modelling vox/choir-instruments is not that easy.<br>
unimpressive to non-sceners?<br>
try showing it to your average CS/q*/UT-player, and tell them to compare the size of the intro with the size of their game's install directory. They will refuse to believe it's a 64k from the first scene.</p><p>

and the music is insanely good :) the synth, the modelling of instruments and the track, it all rules. </p><p>

a great intro, and far better than the productions of all the idiots slagging it off. including macaw.</p></div>

  <p>this was a lession to all of us, learning to get more out of our lame PC. i've loved the sound generator quality, really phat. the intro ran smoothly. the design isn't what i really like, all those 3D worlds etc. but still asskickin' !!<br>
</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c11755">
  <p>Best f*cking textures i've ever seen in an intro.  Nice music, amazing scenes.  I loved the cathedral scene.....  plus the MUSIC that plays during the loading!!!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c11928">
  <div><p>yes, I voted sucks. No, it doesn't suck. But Heaven Seven is, in my opinion, better. So I'll use my vote to get this down to second, heh.. it's not like it's going to fall off the bottom of the top 10. I'm quite happy for it to be second. If you don't want me to do this, eat me or something.</p><p>

However, this wouldn't really be that impressive as a demo. Sure, the sheer amount of quality textures/sounds/models/code they squeezed into that 64k is damn amazing, heh.. but at the end of the day it's just a 3D flyby. I could code something that loads 3D models and renders them. But I'd take rather more than 64k, heh.</p><p>

Heaven 7... I just think it's better. Sorry kb, I prefer it, heh. fr-08 still rulz.</p></div>

  <div><p>I don't think it was a good idea to thumb down a demo to get another one in the 1st place. Thumbs are about what you like, and you like FR08 too I guess...</p><p>

  <p>Simply Rocks!<br>
I really enjoyed this demo the first, second and third time I saw  it!<br>
To people claiming that this intro is just a boring fly-by: just try to code an 64k intro with the visual&amp;musical quality of Das Podrukt (or better if you can), then release it. Probably you will fail.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c12664">
  <div><p>I just read some of the comments here and i absolutly can't understand why someone could actually CRITICIZE that intro? The first time i started "Das Produkt" i just watched it with my mouth wide open, always thinking "How the hell did they DO THAT?!?!" and "Why does it look so DAMNED good??". This was my first impression and in the meantime i've watched that intro more times i ever could count... and i still LOVE it!</p><p>

A simply flyby-demonstration, as some have written? Am i blind, or what? In my opinion all the 3d-scenes in this intro are excellent (like e.g. that rotating "thing" - have a look at the screenshot above - which looks amazing), all the colors (!) and structures fit perfectly together. And the music? I've burned it on CD, i'm listening to it in my car... and guess what... it still ROCKS, even without the intro "behind" it! And all of that... combined in 64K. </p><p>

It seems that many sceners are just judging the technical side of a demo/intro, without realizing that there is something even more important, something special that sometimes makes the difference between a good and a bad demonstration... what i'm speaking about is the human wish for ESTHETIC!</p><p>

Beside the fact that it is in 64K, "Das Produkt" gives me a good - ESTHETIC - feeling when watching it, and that's why i keep on watching it, over an over again, like e.g. "Kasparov", which was also mentioned in one posting as a "boring demo". When these demos/intros are boring, than i'm proud of beeing a REAL boring guy! ;)</p><p>

Great work, Farbrausch, that's all what is left to say.</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c12666">
  <div><p>actually, the technical side is the best bit. If it was just a demo with all the music, textures and model stored on disk, it would just be another 3D flyby. Sure, it would be a particularly good 3D flyby, but likelyhood is it wouldn't be the #1 prod. The fact that it's *all* pregenerated...</p><p>

wow.</p></div>

  <p>sheet....what is going on in the PC scene, on the c64 you have to synthesize music, and you have to work hard to make anything, but there's no b*tching like there is here,why be like this about demos? demos have always been about showing off/having fun, you know, seeing the real skills that people have in the scene, not about all the crap like, 'this has been done before, this has bad... this has...' pah!...just enjoy it, it's free, look at the price you pay for other entertainment!!..some people just don't know when they've been born.. why do you analyze it so much? is it because you have no talent to make the same thing yourself? why not do something good by giving positive criticism? help with productions.become a member of Far-Brausch!!!...if you knowso much about how to make good demos..then why not make the perfect one?....hey..KB!!..your sound routine is very good, i don't care what anyone says....any chance of a SID version??<br>

  <div><p>I have too watched this demo a hundred times by now. Yes, it still rules. The music is fantastic, even *without* taking into account how it is generated. Some textures are simply incredible. The camera moves are very well done. Personally, I have no design objections about the product whatsoever. Frankly, I can not think how this could be better in any way. It is simply awesome.</p><p>

Of course, anybody has the right to hate it, I can understand that, not everyone thinks and feels the same way. I have to mention though that I have this stinking impression that popularity and the top 10 is calculated by page visits *only*. So voting it down does not take it off the top spot, it just misleads people. And, for the last of it, forget about the top 10! In my book, it does not have Second Reality in it or State of the art, so it doesn't make any sense anyway.</p></div>

Also.. the complaints about static scenes, etc... Ask yourself.. Would dynamic scenes have been more appropriate in this demo?  I would argue no.. I find that coldness was the chosen atmosphere.

  <p>Since I Can't Stop Watching This<br>
Demo, How About Adding a Loop Function, That Would Be Sweet, No?<br>
signing off here POOF!! </p>
  
</div>
<div id="c18336">
  <p>If you want it to loop, use a .bat file with A "goto" in it... However, I cannot acknowledge Chaos regarding intros and their understanding by non-sceners: Most people IÂ´ve seen do not have any idea what a kilobyte is, they do not use floppies, neither do they know wether a slow download is caused by a slow connection or large file sizes (which also explains why several people send me mails beeing several MB large). Thus, 4k and 64ks are in most cases compared to productions beeing several MB large, or even rendered/captured videos. The usual question regarding size optimizing is: "Why that?   My HD is XXX GB large, a CD-R is 700Megs large, and it can be done faster and better using 3DStudio"<br>

  <div><p>Now, some points from me, as everybody diss me already so nothing to lose.<br>
First of all. This "product" is great. I watched it for 4 times now, and notice that every time at the gate I expect it to open, and than start thinking about how much better it would have been if it wasn't so "static." <br>
I like the camera movements still but, like, camera to aproach a door and the door to open is 10 times better than a door in scene.<br>
I would have made the scenes bigger however, but as it's precalced is the polygon count really so high ??</p><p>

Anyway, this is a good intro. As Heaven 7 is, but they both share the fact that they get boring. Yes. I think H7 gets boring too.<br>
And why ?</p><p>

Animation.  and the lack of it. And animation is not lights that turn, not objects that morph, but .. eh... world that looks like something is happening. Spot would be example where this is done well, but it has.. eh.. other issues. -grin- anyway. nice job, keep up good work.</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c24197">
  <p>I think everything has already been said about this one. Might get boring after you've watched it a few times, but is just astonishing from the technical side, blablabla, ah well I guess I'll just vote... :)</p>

  <div><p>What is great with this demo? Many people say that it does not really do anything more then display scenes and play music. Granted. It only does that. But komplexity is not neciseraly a positive thing when it comes to art and expression.</p><p>

The show those scenes in a very good way. Interesting and indeed awsome when you think about the fact that it is 64k.</p><p>

What really makes this demo flow is the music tho. The music is extreme! :)<br>
It builds the athomsphere, and the slight attitude of the demo at times. It is the glue that holds the demo together.</p><p>

The demo is also great as an expanle. If you need to show something to non sceners. "The Product" is great. Becouse it is something they can understand the effort in. They can se. "OMG! This is small!" and anyone can download and run with no problem. And most will find it easialy enternatining.</p></div>

<div id="c40742">
  <p>Maybe this demo isn't very original in the way it was done, (yeah, it's only 3D with textures, isn't it?)... BOY!! The day I can do something like this with only 64 Kbytes, I'll rule the world!! Great demo!!</p>

  <p>Just noticed that I haven't voted for this one yet. This was definately the highlight of TP2000, I've never seen something more stunning in a compo than this one, we were just shocked by the music quality, the textures, the realworld-geometry, ... although I was told that Farbrausch was to release a great intro, I hadn't expected such a masterpiece.</p>

  <p>only a 3d world. still, the whole production is very professional. about the size: great idea about making your own construction kit for generation of sound/textures/objects. ofcourse all kinds of dll's and os-stuff help keep the thing small too, don't forget that.<br>
i would dislike it if it weren't 64k, but now it's cool.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c58016">
  <p>the more abstract stuff (such as in the screenshot) is really good.  for the most part though, it's a protracted, and uninteresting 3d scene player.  it gets a thumb up for getting me interested in the demo scene again (typical "all that in 64k?!" as i showed it to all the comp.sci students i knew), and for creating an engine used in much better demos (like poem to a horse).  it is, of course, an amazing technical triumph, if not a complete artistic success.</p>
  
</div>


<div id="c59032">
  <p>i can't believe i haven't already voted for it.<br>
for me, this is definiteley one of the best 64k intors ever - that is stash, fresnel 2, the product. please stop this pointless discussions wheter it is a "gamer style" intro or not, or how abstract the design has to be in order to be cool. it is just an awsome intro which has taken a lot of effort, creativity and experience, i suppose.</p>

  <p>h7 surprised me by it's art and tech, there's a message to be understood and nice acrt+music+tech. There's no message on fr8 but it's tech quality is really unseen 'till that day when it was released. It's a breakthrough in tech. really rulez.</p>

  <p>Very impressive. I didn't like it at first (and I was afraid that I had given it a "sucks" on pouet, luckily I hadn't :) but watching it again after 2 years it still impresses me. No wonder it turned them from some group called Farb-Rausch into <b>the</b> Farb-Rausch.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c66057">
  <div><p>I've been hovering on the outer edge of the scene for years, watching with some fascination but never creating anything more than a few crappy mods (and lurking in #trax in 1996...) This intro blew me away when I saw it last year, and motivated me to try writing some tiny 3D demos, so for that, I thank farbrausch. I have the utmost respect for their skills, but above all for the time and effort that must have gone into honing them.</p><p>

Oh, and I showed theproduct to colleagues at the games company where I worked at the time - and even the artists were impressed ;-)</p></div>

<div id="c69611">
  <p>This is still very impressive - everything fits together very nicely.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c69936">
  <div><p>I wish I could explain what this "demo" has done to me in a mere moment.</p><p>

I've learned through my whole life that in a 32bit enviroment, nothing can ever be less than 1/32'th it's size without doing some funky trip, like MOD's are midi's with a different instrument definition.</p><p>

Even if something could be smaller, it would take enormous processing power to do it.</p><p>

I watched the video, wondering "the trick", waiting for the message that said "ha ha, this was already in 'Windows' or 'Direct3D'" or "we've secretly been downloading this the whole time!"</p><p>

There was no tort, there was no jest, there was no dastardly trick underlying the whole thing.</p><p>

I don't think even a quarter of the people who've posted hear understand the significance of this, this 64k file. Calc.exe is bigger. Game developers could use this endlessly. On the fly online gaming would be a painless reality. After the interface, after the 'real' textures, after the scripts and executables and the game manuals... a full fledged 20 hour flight of nirvanic gameplay could be well within a hundred megs.</p><p>

Maybe it's my fascination with the "whisper text" and mysterious scenery, like some Squaresoft preview, but this tiny file has rocked my forkin socks off.</p><p>

I still remember myself half an hour ago, saying... "hah! It's probably just some stupid flash animation, or a little cube that spins around on a looped script..."</p><p>

My brain hurts... And this has been around for over two years?!</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c72311">
  <p>Okay, I really donâ€™t understand something here, Iâ€™ve never seen files compressed like this, Iâ€™ve heard of like 1mb compressed into 200 kb or something thatâ€™s 5:1 thatâ€™s a great compression ratio for our days or a 10:1 thatâ€™s awesome, but 30000:1 thatâ€™s just insane!! Thatâ€™s something impossible and especially for Christmas of 2000!! Thatâ€™s crazy for 2 years ago, but when we download it from this site it could simply be giving us a virus that could just trick our computer into thinking its 64kb but in reality its 1.9 gigs, it would be easy to do that and this whole crazy compression file thing could be a hoax, but of course, I could be wrong, and somehow, super compression programs could be compressing them that I never heard about. If this product is real on the other and, awesome job guys, to compress graphics like that and a soundtrack like that and everything for 16 mins is amazing, keep up the good work. But I did run it through a bunch of programs like WinZip and found o% compression so that was weird, but maybe it was too much for WinZip to handle lol, anyway, keep working on more demos, they're awesome if they're real ;)</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c72868">
  <div><p>aflfuah: you have just been tricked to download a 1.9GB file in approxematly the same time it takes to download a 64kb file, neat trick, virii rocks!<br>
and please stop talking about 30000:1 compression ratios<br>
all the data is procedually generated and the entire thing is afaik compressed using the apack algorithm. The apack algorithm isn't really that exotic its just a very well made lz77 variant with gamma encoded offsets, which is hardly state of the art :)</p><p>

besides all that this is a really groundbreaking intro, I was really amazed when I saw it the first time, it was the actual reason i got involved in the demo-scene!<br>
great job! :)</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c74512">
  <p>Guaranteed farb-rausch quality.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c79493">
  <p>When I first started watching this demo when it came out, the first thing that went through my mind was, "Man, those textures sure repeat quickly." :)  But then the next scene came up... and then the next... and then the next... each scene got better and better, and it wasn't long before I was blown away by how much was packed into such a small space.  Definite mastery all-around... the soundtrack is great, because although some of the scenes are very long, the music keeps you compelled.  The textures are also very nice, and each one fits the object it's on.  Everyone that I show this to -- as long as they know what 64k represents -- are absolutely stunned.  The remainder?  It's a split between people who love it because it looks and sounds great, and those that just don't get it.  I, for one, tip my hat to those involved in this production, and I'm glad that there seems to be no end in sight for what Farbrausch is capable of.  Keep up the great work!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c80230">
  <div><p>Wow, never commented on this??!</p><p>

FR-08 was a massive milestone for the scene imo. Before, nothing had come close... the complexity of the scenes, the beutiful textures, the amazing soundtrack....</p><p>

Sure, it was perhaps a little boring, just flybys over and over, but that doesn't detract from the pure technical greatness of it! And don't forget, this gave the farb rausch guys the tools they needed for the later intros like poem to a horse!</p><p>

Also, if i still like this demo 3 years later, it must have something special other than just the code...</p><p>

Major respect to farb rausch for making this!</p></div>

  <p>Well, heard the hype, seen it many time,s and I still don't get it. Still, I am more of the type who enjoy more a cleverly designed demo instead of a cleverly programmed one. In other words, I look more at them rather than thinking how they pulled X or Y shit. Therefore, I consider this demo to be severely overrated.

I'm sorry, but i am yet waiting for a better one than this... It's too good, the next farb-rauschs feel like crap compared to this... I wonder whether KB can top his own music once... I hear from time to time in the scene, fr-09 is considered "better", is considered "art", and this one is considered "code" - at the contrary, i find the "bitchy" (to wrongly quote kb) music and simple but life-like objects of fr-08 make up this gloomy atmosphere still unmatched! I think we have seen those screen-like, spiky, and most other kinds of fr-09 things quite a bit too often in the demosene!</p><p>

FR PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER INTRO WHICH WOULD RULE AGAIN! I find everything else up to date somewhat boring. It's not your fault, there were many which were well-done, it's prrobably just not matching my taste. </p></div>

  <p>Yes, it was the best for it's time and not only. However, my personal favorite from farbrausch is candytron. I don't know why. Perhaps because it's so cuuuttee :)</p>

Technically very good, excelent code and so on. The music also rocks. However, this intro has destroyed the intro genre to me. Now EVERYBODY is coding generative tool-intros, almost noone uses compression anymore. This leads to all intros looking the same, plasmatextures and primitive-based geometry all over the place. Ofcourse the fr-members can't personally be held responsible for this, so a piggie is in order. (The intro is still very boring)</p></div>

  <p>UAU!<br>
The best fx and the music is cool ! *-*</p>

  <p>Holy crap this is an INTRO??? [falls off chair]</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c104760">
  <p>The first demo i have seen from farbrausch and one of the first i saw at all. Hmm what to say, i feel in love with this. Musik, design, textures, feeling is impressive. Its very nice to see thats its still so popular, even after such a long time. <br>
Watch it! Watch all! Wath the end scroller!<br>
Ein Meilenstein.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c105177">
  <div><p>this was the first demo i ever saw about 2 years ago. it was hanging around on my old 166 for about four months. then when i got it running on this baby, it said "this is your future."</p><p>

then i wanted to see more and more and more...</p></div>

  <p>much stuff for 64K :D<br>
everything in this demo roolz :D</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c115433">
  <p>Wow. This demo runs on any computer I give it to, and (not being a "demoer") I introduce everyone who boasts their "260GB hard drives" and "2GB of RAM" to .the .product. Even today, it blows them away, every time. If Farbrausch could get together in the video game scene, with some great video-game minds, they'd have a total monopoly over the whole industry. I mean, the music is beyond definition, the graphics are mind-blowing... hell, these guys can redefine computers, if it weren't for the dang money-pumping upgrade crap the world is forcing people to do! <b>GO FARBRAUSCH!</b> You guys ROCK!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c115872">
  <p>falcon actually they did.. check www.theprodukkt.com Facts are that i prefer fr as demoscener that as gamecoder.. gaming it's not the higher level of making a good 3D ;)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c116809">
  <p>This one was my fav for a loooong time. Deserves it's place in the top10 :)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c117010">
  <p>Simply excellent effort. It really turns your head, I can't believe I hadn't voted yet :-)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c117535">
  <p>I want to buy the product!</p>

<div id="c117933">
  <p>I can watch this for the 50th time and still see new random camera movements I haven't seen before ;-)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c117939">
  <p>hey, I never voted this one! In one word, PERFECT.</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c117976">
  <p>a classic - this prod spawned an entirely new intro genre.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c118012">
  <p>the intro that changed it all</p>

  <p>It never ends god damn it!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c118275">
  <div><p>ist perfect... i don't like the scene with the alien-plant-stuff, but the rest is so greeeaaattt!!!</p><p>

The music is simlpy perfect!</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c118371">
  <div><p>_dylan_: Yeah, that was what first got me into Farbrausch. Unfortunately, the system requirements for that thing are off the chart! I got a 128mb GeForce FX 5200 just so I could play that game, at about 10FPS. Eh...</p><p>

Farbrausch still rules. And this is still about the best demo yet. ;)</p></div>

  <p>It's an achievement, that's for certian.<br>
</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c121321">
  <p>probably the most impressive pc demo ive ever seen to date; just by performance vs size vs gfx. im not a pc scene fan, but i really loved this. i had the tune in my car for awhile too; great baseline to pump :) </p>
  
</div>



<div id="c124166">
  <p>geee, this demo rocks ! you really gotta hear the music @ max volume... brialliant stuff. not to be missed. period.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c124941">
  <p>I can't believe it fits in 64K !<br>
Astonishing !</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c127817">
  <p>This one was great (although incredibly boring). All the subsequent attempts at copying it were even more boring.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c128508">
  <p>the classic (not-oldskool) intro </p>
  
</div>
<div id="c128510">
  <p>not my cup of tea. lacks nice 2d-art.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c128539">
  <p>i know i'm leaving known territory here - but... you 'lack of 2d art' people really go on my nerves. go'n watch 'we cell' instead :) <br>
4 more years!  <br>
</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c128755">
  <p>You don't need my thumb up :)<br>
This one started something.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c128787">
  <p>this one really rocks. actually the one that pushed the 64k evolution to a new standard. really great. one of the few fr prods i really love!</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c130868">
  <p>hey proteque youre a idiot. its a intro so how should someone put "nice" 2d art into it.</p>

  <p>uh, still not voted? na jetzt wirds aber mal zeit</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c130871">
  <p>the product makes you go .w00t <br>
my all-time favorite! keep up the good work!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c130897">
  <p>I guess I can't deny that this is rather cool. Flyby, but the first cool one in 64k, and the music is brilliant. I remember being totally awed when it was released. </p>
  
</div>
<div id="c132251">
  <p>the product makes me cum :)</p>
  
</div>



<div id="c138396">
  <p>Obscenely impressive when I first saw it, but absolutely zero staying power. </p>
  
</div>
<div id="c139109">
  <p>Rulez. Awesome tune btw :)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c139846">
  <p>Thumbs up! I Love the music :-)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c141226">
  <p>There was an epoch before and after this intro for the 64kb prods. Impressive :)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c141239">
  <p>Still impressive, makes you wanna code :)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c146146">
  <p>whoa, still didn't thumb this up? so here goes. Easily one of the first intros I ever saw, still freaks me out.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c148406">
  <p>Back on new years day I needed to hear some good music so I pulled this intro off my HD and played it at least 21 times that day, What caught my eye was just as the intro fades back to the desktop I noticed that the scenes were never the same, in others words it would end with the water scene then the tunnel the fenced factory with the beaming lights out, It never makes the same ending design twice like all other demos and intros do.<br>
And I notice this now? after being released for 5 years and 1 month? <b>Amazing!!</b></p>
  
</div>
<div id="c148633">
  <p>nice... really nice... it just flat out ROXXX!!! (heh, love the end scroller, nice touch... poke... what ever ;-))</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c149761">
  <p>what can you say 'bout this? 64k milestone, i guess.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c149763">
  <div><p>of course, this one is technically impressive and makes the turn...</p><p>

... but in fact i find it rather boring when not watching for the first time.</p><p>

verdict: just ok</p></div>
  
</div>

<div id="c151894">
  <p>A milestone in 64k and one of those demos that gets a viewing more than once :)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c152123">
  <p>No idea how often i'd watched this one.<br>
An absolutely all time classic.<br>
Music is great, too. Best audial enjoyment at the endpart-scroller.<br>
Oh..and while we are at it: This piece of 'Fahrstul-Musik' during decrunching is well done, too.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c152249">
  <p>This was one of the first demos I ever saw.  All I really remember was that I was rather impressed - all that in less than 64k?  After a couple years and some more understanding demos, I'm still rather particular to this one.  Plus it's one of the few really cool demos that runs on my laptop.<br>
I've watched this one a lot.  This is how I got interested in demos.  Plus it's got cool music, too.  That never hurts.  =)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c153021">
  <div><p>I was totally shocked when first saw this demo in 2003. Just couldn't believe that SO MUCH STUFF can fit into a tiny 64k .exe :) Then i saw a "scene.org" file, followed the link... and entered the fantastic world of the demoscene...</p><p>

RULEZ</p></div>
  
</div>


<div id="c153498">
  <p>Cool for 64k!!! It's got good music and some cool visuals, but nothing makes you want to show it off to peeple. </p>
  
</div>
<div id="c154562">
  <p>Four years later, it still deserves a thumb up for quality.</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c154995">
  <p>a bit tool long, but indeed technically impressive and makes the turn</p>
  
</div>


<div id="c161014">
  <p>one of the longest 64k demos i've ever seen - really a lot of scenes and effects in it... very impressive</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c161806">
  <p>I give this one a thumbs up because it was very impressive when i first saw it. Unfortunately this feeling decays when watching it multiple times...</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c161908">
  <p>The first demo i saw, fb build my interest to the scene, this prod rulz inside, the music is fantastic, and the atmosphere is quite amazing, 64Ko, wow i just share it with all my friend, huge thx</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c166372">
  <p>Cool but this prod could have used a more structured "plot". As it is now it's mainly a collection of unrelated 3d sceneries.</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c172950">
  <p>Yes my thumb is late, but its probably cos everytime I watch this piece of magic I'm so awestruck that I just forget :-)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c174491">
  <p>Nice product, really impressed me.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c177640">
  <p>fantastic.. great flow, hooky music, very professional -- not to mention better than many demos 200 times its size!  well done..</p>

  <p>this was my first scene prod i saw after years of doing nothing. i was amazed how the scene has changed. MY LONGTIME FAVOURITE. fb is best, like FC in former days. especially all music prods by kb, Wayfinder and PANIQ are mindblowing. keep on, boys :o)</p>

<div id="c182091">
  <p>Long ago this the best intro. This was large progress.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c182147">
  <p>i haven't commented on this? great intro :) especially the music - reminds me a bit of "covenant - stalker"</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c184074">
  <p>Amazing amount of information stored in a mere 64K. The music if taken out separately takes 10Mb!</p>

<div id="c184089">
  <p>the product will thumb you</p>

<div id="c187848">
  <p>the first demo i ever saw... and still sits comfortably on the top bench of demo mountain.</p>

  <p>Can't believe I didn't commented this one.<br>
Now it's not really that impressive but I can remember the impact.. and the music still rocks ass!</p>

<div id="c196967">
  <p>I always wondered about why this intro is considered to be so top notch?<br>
Now you can say because of the huge amount of 3D content...aha....but I desperately <b>missed</b><br>
the content that makes a real intro.<br>
For my personal point 2D gfx elements (even in a 64k) are very<br>
important to complete a well designed production and therefor making it a classic.<br>
period</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c196995">
  <p>Technically brilliant but a bit boring. I still like the stuff Chaos did on Amiga much more! :)</p>

  <p>I can't understand why I didn't allready vote. I remember the first time I saw this intro I was stunned, even though it was only a 3dflyby. I watched it again today (6 years later) and some scenes look a bit crapy, but it's still amazing :D</p>

<div id="c256198">
  <p>absolutely incredible prod for it's time!  hard to believe this was done in 64k (with space to spare!) back in 2000.</p>

  <p>The textoutput with the circles is the only thing that comes close to what I look for in a good demo. The rest is not my cup of tea at all, even though the technical achievement is probably huge. </p>

  <p>Filesize. 2000. So no thumb down. BUT.<br>
Seeing the first time made me go "WOW". <br>
2nd time I was really bored and just waited to read the end scroller I had missed.<br>
There was no third time.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c322724">
  <p>ok, i somehow have to appreciate the technical aspects (i think it was the time farb-rausch was developing their texture generators, music synths, data shrinkers, etc). i have to appreciate the kb's music which is good enough, but i can't deprive myself of the feeling that this is just not the intro with the scene spirit.<br>
this intro was popular, yeah, pretty long time it was the top demoscene artifact on pouet, even before heaven 7, but now, from the perspective of time, it's the heaven 7 being best of the intros and somehow i feel product will never take a second breath. das produkt's only efect was to show how much you can put into 64 kiB. although it was awsome, long-term considering it, it's just not enough.</p>

i dont care anymore about how good the code is,becoz the visuals got me somehow !</p><p>

a demo is a product-of-music-graphic-code to put it into your words...just one thing.: i dont have ANYTHING against you...i like you and iÂ´m a fb_whore myself....im a farbrausch-lovA.!</p><p>

didnt i put a thumb in there ?? </p></div>

  <div><p>This was the first, big, professionally made 64kb demo I ever watched. It got me into the group of the demoscene I like to call "leechers", or "consumers", to be nice (to myself).</p><p>

It was fantastic, and I can just about quote the ending text completely (numbers excepted) from watching it several dozen times over the last, oh, four years or so.</p><p>

I just wish there was a little menu for resolution... I wish someone could make something that would run older demos in higher res... heh. That'd be a bit of work...</p></div>

  <p>I attended the party that year as a young coder with little idea of how crazy this thing was (and still is).

What made me start with graphics again was werkkzeug. The produkkt changed my life two times. Thanks to you guys :-)</p>

............<br>

  <div><p>maaaan... this is one of the first demos I watched. My dad showed it to us. I was quite impressed, but when it got to the end scroller which said that the 64K .exe file somehow contained 2 GB worth of data... that's when my interest in the demoscene really started. </p><p>

I tried fruitlessly to hunt down this demo, having never known its name. Until one day I looked at pouet . net's "top ten" list... and one of the demos within looked oddly familiar... and after a few minutes I thought, "Gotcha."</p></div>

  <p>Good for its time and some of the scene designs are quite innovative.  However, the ugly textures and low poly models haven't stood the test of time very well and I have always found the object-labeling thing annoying.   As a glimpse of greater Farbrausch to come though... piggy.</p>
  
</div>

  <div><p>Wait, how come I never thumbed this up?!</p><p>

This one is a classic, that has been very inspiring in several ways. How many sceners out there became so after seeing this? How many people tried to code some generator of some sort after seeing this?</p></div>

Also, how did someone cap this demo in HD? I am asking since I'd like to run this demo in Full HD.</p></div>
  
</div>

<div id="c652607">
  <p>TomoAlien: The "HD" captures floating around on Youtube are actually upsampled from the original resolution, just because it still looks way better than YT's low-bitrate 360p videos.</p>

Even the soundtrack itself is just E-P-I-C (especially the very first few seconds) Hearing this reminds me how times just gone very fast. I still remember when this has just been released. Almost 15 years ago but it feels very close to me.</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c677994">
  <p>On of the first demo to really impress me. Love the musik track. About time I thumb this up.</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c678455">
  <p>or rather :1,.-2g/thumbup/p</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c687113">
  <p>A milestone in the history of PC 64ks, though rather dated now. However, the music still works extremely well, after all these years, thus a nostalgic thumb up. :)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c692283">
  <p>Awesome 64k for its time and still enjoyable!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c700537">
  <p>Was impressive when it came! Just like me!!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c703318">
  <p>I never thumbed up das Produkt? Shame on me.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c705636">
  <p>Still good 14 years after. I was at The Party where it was released, and I can still remember me smiling widely when that insanely aggressive sound started during the grid-texture tunnel part. Fuck that was good entertainment :D</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c708104">
  <p>Even the music is worth an award. fr-08 is one of the intros, which have dominated the scene decisively. World class!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c715099">
  <p>still unbelievable that it's 64k</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c717695">
  <p>Good technically, but boring. Still thumbs up.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c730126">
  <p>I Feel right at home with that prod! Cozy to watch! Cool soundtrack! AND 64k, wow!</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c747187">
  <p>Love the demo, of course, but it's kb soundtrack that always mesmerize me - one of my favorite demo music ever.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c752805">
  <p>not my cup of tea, ... but still exceptional good for 64k!!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c755955">
  <div><p>Just watched this for the millionth time over the years   :)    Absolutely one of the best demos ever. Of course when I first watched it 15 years ago, my jaw hit the floor because it was only 64k. But it endures because of its industrial beauty, the stark beauty of the landscapes they created just really resonate with me. And the excellent music. </p><p>

Classic, absolutely classic.</p></div>
  
</div>
<div id="c758783">
  <p>Awesome for it's time, I remember being completely bowled over by this one... yes a little dated now, compared to the recent round of awesomeness in 64k, but still a milestone that will be remembered for years to come :)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c760412">
  <p>The produkt. made me happy. 64 kb of engineer art.</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c771614">
  <p>Oh my god, how can i don't rulez for my favorite 64k demo. This is the best!!!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c773831">
  <p>late thumb. awesome tune that, unlike the rest of the 64k, still kicks ass.</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c782815">
  <p>this one was really special for the "tuned computers" at that time... i remember how we got better graphiccards and cpus till 3D was about fluently on screen! i really liked that music and the overall concept... just some more buildings and it would be perfect ...</p>
  
</div>


<div id="c798243">
  <p>Simply fantastic and still rulez.</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c805785">
  <p>I always show it to Java programmers to make them feel ashamed that an average Java class, which can barely display a string, is much bigger than this demo, and requires a virtual machine, which again, is hundreds of times bigger :)</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c809884">
  <p>I'm not decent to describe product!</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c820163">
  <p>Still looks great - only giveaway that it's over 17 years old is that the resolution is fairly low.. would look fab in UHD</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c845581">
  <p>one of the better demos, with an intro that could be set as a warcraft-intro, if there would be some charakters inside. interesting camera style, just i like to see knights or something around.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c861854">
  <p>bought this demo at a local shop in South Africa, wonderful demo showing how incredible skilled Farbrausch is!!!</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c867041">
  <p>Great advance in technology, but does not fit me visually.</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c870267">
  <p>the music alone. thank you for demo!</p>
  
</div>

<div id="c870319">
  <p>oh yeah, this was good for its time &lt;3</p>
  
</div>
<div id="c871120">
  <p>sentimental trip back to Frau Brauch era ;-)</p>
