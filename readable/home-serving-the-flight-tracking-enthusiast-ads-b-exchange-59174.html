<p>Welcome to ADSBexchange.com, a co-op of ADS-B/Mode S/MLAT feeders from around the world, and the world’s largest source of unfiltered flight data. &nbsp;Thanks to our worldwide community of participants, if the data is broadcast over the air, you can find it here. &nbsp;This opens up a whole new world of interesting traffic for hobbyists and researchers alike.</p>
<p>In fact, ADS-B Exchange is proud to collaborate with C4ADS to support its mission to produce data-driven reporting to understand, prevent, and mitigate global <a href="http://c4ads.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://www.adsbexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/c4logoblack-e1482209290563.png" alt="c4logoblack" width="200" height="104"></a>conflict. &nbsp;This partnership will yield more receivers in interesting and unusual global locations, ADS-B Exchange will have wider coverage and C4ADS will have more data to enhance their mission.</p>
<p><em>We are always looking for new participants to expand our network. &nbsp;Be sure to check out the&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/how-to-feed/"><em>“how to feed” page.</em></a></p>
<p>Although you can do it here, this is <strong>not</strong> the go-to site to track your grandmother’s flight from Cincinnati to Chicago so you can pick her up from the airport. &nbsp;For that, ADS-B Exchange recommends <a href="https://www.radarbox24.com/">radarbox24.com.</a></p>
<p>ADS-B Exchange differs from typical flight tracking sites in two primary ways.</p>
<p>First and foremost ADS-B Exchange does not participate in the “security theater” performed by most other flight tracking websites which do not share data on military or certain private aircraft. There are no <a href="https://www.nbaa.org/news/insider/2012/05/flight-tracking.php">FAA BARR</a>, military, or other “filters” here.&nbsp; ADS-B Exchange does not accept payment or requests to remove aircraft from public tracking.</p>
<p>By definition, ADS-B information is broadcast unencrypted over the air.&nbsp; Any member of the public with $100 and the ability to order parts from Amazon can receive this data. &nbsp;ADS-B Exchange does not expose anything that is not freely available via other methods, however the power of the network is realized when all participants’ data is aggregated resulting in wide, global coverage.</p>
<p>Secondly, all data sent in from the community is, in turn,<strong> made available back to the community</strong> <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/data">through various archives and APIs</a>. (<a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/data">www.adsbexchange.com/data</a>). &nbsp;Best of all, <strong>for non-commercial use, all of this data is freely accessible to anyone hosting a feeder</strong>!</p>
<p>We do ask that any non-commercial users, who are able, contribute a small amount to help cover costs and ensure the continuing existence of this site.&nbsp; <b>All commercial users are required to license the data from ADSBexchange, contact us </b><a href="https://adsbexchange.com/contact/">here</a><b> for terms.</b></p>
<p>Processing <strong>petabytes</strong> of incoming data monthly, the storage and redistribution of this data, and the effort involved to add new features, does require significant technical infrastructure and effort and it is only fair to ask those profiting from this data to share the costs.</p>
<p>Some of the “big” flight tracking websites have reacted “negatively” to ADS-B Exchange’s approach, but this site was built for hobbyists, by hobbyists. ADS-B Exchange does not exist to serve Fortune 500 flight departments, airlines, governments, or large corporate interests.&nbsp; ADS-B Exchange exists to serve the aviation hobbyist/enthusiast first and foremost.</p>
<p>If a business or organization finds ADS-B Exchange data useful, we are happy to license its use for a reasonable fee that is used to help offset the costs to keep the website active.</p>
<p><em>If you are interested in helping all you need is a Raspberry Pi, an SDR, and an Antenna which can all be had for $100 to $200 depending on how fancy you want to get, be sure to check out the </em><a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/how-to-feed/"><em>“how to feed” page</em></a> for more info.</p>
