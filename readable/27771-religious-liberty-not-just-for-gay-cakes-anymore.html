    <h1>&#x27;Religious Liberty&#x27; - Not Just for Gay Cakes Anymore</h1>
    <div><div id="article-content" class="js_article-content"> <p>Here&#x2019;s a pretty important wake-up call for those who may need waking up about the growth of support for &#x2018;religious liberty&#x2019; exemptions as a tool to provide legal sanctuary for affirmative discrimination. A <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/increasing-support-for-religiously-based-service-refusals/">new poll from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI)</a> shows the percentages of public support for certain kinds of discrimination under &#x2018;religious liberty&#x2019; exemptions and how they&#x2019;ve grown in recent years &#x2013; and substantial numbers support exemptions to discriminate against Muslims and Jews. </p> <p>Let&#x2019;s start with gays and lesbians &#x2013; the group around whom we&#x2019;ve seen the most litigation &#x2013; the evangelical baker who won&#x2019;t bake a same sex marriage wedding cake, etc. In 2014 16% of Americans thought this was okay if it violated the small business owner&#x2019;s religious beliefs. Today that&#x2019;s 30%. The big growth is among Republicans (21% to 47%). But there&#x2019;s significant growth among Democrats and independents too.</p>
<p>What about people who say they&#x2019;re religious beliefs prevent them from offering their services to African-Americans? 10% in 2014 and 15% today.</p>
<p>What about Jews? In 2014 it was 12%. Today 19%. The internal breakdown? With evangelical protestants it&#x2019;s gone from 12% to 24%. Not terribly surprising. But it&#x2019;s gone up even more with mainline protestants &#x2013; 11% to 26%. Catholics are 10% to 20%. Nonwhite protestants haven&#x2019;t shifted as much &#x2013; just 19% up from 14%. Only &#x201C;religiously unaffiliated&#x201D; have remained stable at 11%. </p>
<p>Support for refusing service to Muslims is slightly higher than Jews &#x2013; 22%. But the question wasn&#x2019;t asked in 2014. So we don&#x2019;t know the trend. </p>
<p>Here are the breakdowns by targeted group and political ideology.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Service-Refusal-Figure_4-804x598.png" alt width="804" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1231798" srcset="https://cdn.talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Service-Refusal-Figure_4-804x598.png 804w, https://cdn.talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Service-Refusal-Figure_4-600x446.png 600w, https://cdn.talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Service-Refusal-Figure_4-1000x743.png 1000w, https://cdn.talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Service-Refusal-Figure_4-804x598@2x.png 1608w, https://cdn.talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Service-Refusal-Figure_4-600x446@2x.png 1200w, https://cdn.talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Service-Refusal-Figure_4-1000x743@2x.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px"></p>
<p>Clearly this is driven overwhelmingly by Republicans. But the trend shows that there&#x2019;s been movement in this direction pretty much across the board.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown by different flavors of Christians and people without religion or at least without an explicit affiliation.</p>

<p>Evangelical protestants support it the most; Catholics the least. What is notable to me though is that mainline protestants aren&#x2019;t that far off from evangelicals.</p>
<p>While Court&#x2019;s are increasingly receptive to accepting de facto racial discrimination if it can be explained by some other notional rationale, I doubt many courts would be receptive to religious arguments about not selling products to African-Americans. Maybe I&#x2019;m not cynical enough. But that&#x2019;s my hunch. But it seems much more plausible that many people could make plausible arguments that their religious beliefs clash with Jews and Muslims. </p>
<p>This is obviously pretty troubling information if you&#x2019;re part of one of these groups. A lot of this, most of this is what it seems like on its face: people are getting more supportive of discrimination against people not in their group. But I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s entirely that. It seems like the proponents of this theory of &#x2018;religious liberty&#x2019; exemption have made some real progress making the argument for the libertarian concept beyond the underlying discriminatory attitudes. Both are troubling. </p> </div></div>
