    <div><p class="byline"> <span class="byline__name">By Joe Tidy</span> <span class="byline__title">Cyber-security reporter </span> </p><div class="story-body__inner"> <figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width lead"> <span class="image-and-copyright-container"> <img class="js-image-replace" alt="Travelex sign" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/C744/production/_110421015_gettyimages-615023590-2.jpg" width="976"> <span class="off-screen">Image copyright</span> <span class="story-image-copyright">Getty Images</span> </span> </figure><p class="story-body__introduction">Hackers are holding foreign exchange company Travelex to ransom after a cyber attack forced the firm to turn off all computer systems and resort to using pen and paper across its thousands of sites.</p><p>On New Year&apos;s Eve, hackers launched their attack on the Travelex network.</p><p>As a result, the company took down its websites across 30 countries to contain &quot;the virus and protect data&quot;.</p><p>The hackers are demanding a ransom to give the firm access to its systems.</p><p>They have demanded payment in exchange for either restoration of IT systems or the preservation of customer data.</p><p>It is understood that a deadline for payment has been set by the cyber criminals.</p><p>The Metropolitan Police is leading the investigation into the attack. </p><p>In a statement, the force said: &quot;On Thursday, 2 January, the Met&apos;s Cyber Crime Team were contacted with regards to a reported ransomware attack involving a foreign currency exchange. Enquiries into the circumstances are ongoing.&quot;</p><p>Travelex says it is working with police and has deployed teams of IT specialists and external cyber security experts who have been working continuously.</p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">&apos;Shockingly bad&apos;</h2><p>The recovery operation is being co-ordinated from a Travelex office in the UK and the company insists that no customer data has been leaked.</p><p>But it would not say what data could potentially be at risk.</p><p>The Travelex websites across Europe, Asia and the US have been offline since 31 December with a message to visitors that it is down due to &quot;planned maintenance&quot;.</p><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width"> <figcaption class="media-caption"> <span class="off-screen">Image caption</span> <span class="media-caption__text"> Visitors to the Travelex website are told that the site is down for &apos;planned maintenance&apos;. </span> </figcaption> </figure><p>Customers have not been sent any email communication about the cyber attack, but queries are being replied to on social media by the company. </p><p>&quot;The public response from Travelex has been shockingly bad,&quot; said security researcher Kevin Beaumont. </p><p>&quot;The Travelex UK website still only says &apos;planned maintenance&apos;, a week after the problems began - many customers will be completely unaware hackers gained access to their network, and allegedly their personal data,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Travelex have a responsibility to clearly communicate with customers and business partners the gravity of the situation.&quot;</p><p>Travelex&apos;s decision to take down its site has meant the large network of other firms that use its services cannot sell currency online.</p><p>The company has said it is keeping its partners up to date on the response to the cyber attack.</p><p>Virgin Money&apos;s site showed an error message, which said: &quot;Our online, foreign currency purchasing service is temporarily unavailable due to planned maintenance. The system will be back online shortly.&quot;</p><p>Sainsbury&apos;s Bank also said its online travel money services were unavailable, although it said customers could still buy travel money in its stores. In a statement to the BBC, the bank said: &quot;We&apos;re in close contact with Travelex so that we can resume our online service as soon as possible.&quot;</p><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width"> <div class="image-and-copyright-container"> <span class="off-screen">Image copyright</span> <span class="story-image-copyright">Sainsbury&apos;s </span> </div> <figcaption class="media-caption"> <span class="off-screen">Image caption</span> <span class="media-caption__text"> Sainsbury&apos;s Bank&apos;s website said it was not able to take money orders online. </span> </figcaption> </figure><p>A spokesperson for First Direct, which is owned by HSBC, said: &quot;Unfortunately, our online travel money service is currently unavailable due to a service issue with third party service provider, Travelex.&quot;</p><p>In a statement on Thursday, Travelex boss Tony D&apos;Souza said: &quot;We regret having to suspend some of our services in order to contain the virus and protect data.&quot;</p><p>The company has resorted to carrying out transactions manually, providing foreign-exchange services over the counter in its branches.</p><p>&quot;We apologise to all our customers for any inconvenience caused as a result,&quot; Mr D&apos;Souza said in the statement.</p><p>The company has since told the BBC that its systems are currently down and it is unable to sell or reload its pre-paid travel cards. But, it said: &quot;Existing cards continue to function as normal and customers in the UK can continue to spend and withdraw money from ATMs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For customers who have ordered money online, please contact Travelex customer services by phone or via social media to discuss their individual situation and requirements.&quot;</p> </div></div>
