<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="p-1">Female medical practitioners and researchers face specific disadvantages in four key areas, writes <strong>Laurie Garrett</strong>. Childbirth is a common factor, and institutions and funders urgently need to recognize and respond to this</p><p id="p-2">I asked Google who discovered climate change, and its top answer was John Tyndall, who published evidence in 1859 on carbon dioxide heating the Earthâ€™s surface.</p><p id="p-3">But Google was incorrect. In 1848 Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Eunice Foote organized the first womenâ€™s rights conference, in Seneca Falls, New York. Afterwards, Foote, a scientist, measured the temperature of various gases when subjected to solar radiation. Carbon dioxide became the hottest, and Foote sent her findings to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.<span>1</span></p><p id="p-4">It accepted her paper, but Foote, as a woman, was not allowed to address the meeting, so her paper was read by a man. And the association refused to publish a womanâ€™s work in the proceedings, so it was released separately. Footeâ€™s work clearly preceded Tyndallâ€™s, but her contribution to climate science is buried in obscurity.</p><p id="p-5">In the 1900s the astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell Burnellâ€™s male boss received the Nobel Prize for proving the existence of pulsars. Rosalind Franklin died before she could contest the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicineâ€”awarded to James Watson, Francis Crick, and her boss, Maurice Wilkins. Franklinâ€™s x ray crystallography was used, without her consent, by Watson and Crick to decipher DNAâ€™s double helix. And, in 2018, Donna Strickland became only the third female honored with a physics Nobel Prize, raising the total of all female science Nobelists ever to 3%. Only then did Canadaâ€™s University of Waterloo make her a full professor.</p><p id="p-6">These stories illustrate the barriers experienced by women at the top of scientific and medical achievement. But most women pursuing research in these disciplines encounter â€¦ </p></div></div></div>
