    <h1>Inter font family</h1>
    <div> <p> Inter started out in late 2016 as an experiment to build a perfectly pixel-fitting font at a specific small size (11px.) The idea was that by crafting a font in a particular way, with a particular coordinate system (Units Per EM), and for a particular target rasterization size (11), it would be possible to get the best of both sharpness and readability. </p> <p> However after a few months of using an early version of Inter, it dawned on everyone exposed to the test that this approach had some serious real-world problems. Most notably that it was really hard to read longer text. Because of the pixel-aligning nature of that approach, the font took an almost <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/HPqDViSCB8fAWuxaV2ousFMv">mono-spaced appearance</a>, making it really easy to read numbers, punctuation and very short words, but eye-straining to read anything longer. </p> <p> The project was rebooted with a different approach, sticking with the specific UPM, but crafting glyphs and kerning in a way that made for more variation in the rhythm and smoother vertical and horizontal stems. As Inter was being developed, it was tested on an internal version of <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>&#x2014;where the author of Inter works as a designer&#x2014;and slowly improved upon based on experience and feedback. </p> </div>
