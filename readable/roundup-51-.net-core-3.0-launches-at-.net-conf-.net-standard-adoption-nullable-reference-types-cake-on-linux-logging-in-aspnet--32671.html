<p>Here are the things that caught my eye recently in .NET.&nbsp; I’d love to hear what you found most interesting this week.&nbsp; Let me know in the comments or on Twitter.     </p>




<h2><a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" .NET Core 3.0 launches at .NET Conf (opens in a new tab)"> .NET Core 3.0 launches at .NET Conf</a></h2>


<blockquote>
<p> .NET Conf is a FREE, 3 day virtual developer event co-organized by the .NET community and Microsoft. This year .NET Core 3.0 will launch at .NET Conf 2019! Come celebrate and learn about the new release. You won’t want to miss this one. </p>

<h2><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/update-on-net-standard-adoption/">Update on .NET Standard adoption</a></h2>


<blockquote>
<p>It’s about two years ago that&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/" target="_blank">I announced .NET Standard 2.0</a>. Since then we’ve been working hard to increase the set of .NET Standard-based libraries for .NET. This includes many of the BCL components, such as the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/" target="_blank">Windows Compatibility Pack</a>, but also other popular libraries, such as the JSON.NET, the Azure SDK, or the AWS SDK. In this blog post, I’ll share some thoughts and numbers about the .NET ecosystem and .NET Standard. </p>

<h2><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/try-out-nullable-reference-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Try out Nullable Reference Types (opens in a new tab)">Try out Nullable Reference Types</a></h2>


<blockquote>
<p>With the release of .NET Core 3.0 Preview 7, C# 8.0 is considered “feature complete”. That means that the biggest feature of them all,&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Nullable Reference Types</a>, is also locked down behavior-wise for the .NET Core release. It will continue to improve after C# 8.0, but it is now considered stable with the rest of C# 8.0. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this post I show two ways to use the&nbsp;<a href="https://cakebuild.net/">Cake build system</a>&nbsp;to build .NET Core projects on Linux: using the&nbsp;<em>Cake.CoreCLR</em>&nbsp;library, or the&nbsp;<em>Cake.Tool</em>&nbsp;.NET Core global tool.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fvu2DJU-dFg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Logging, Metrics and Events in ASP NET Core - Martin Thwaites (opens in a new tab)">Logging, Metrics and Events in ASP NET Core – Martin Thwaites</a></h2>


<blockquote>
<p>Providing decent monitoring of your applications has always been considered the boring part of development, with tons of boilerplate code, and making upfront decisions around how it will be done, or retrofit afterwards. However, with dotnet core, things have changed, it’s never been easier to implement effective visibility into how your application is performing in production. </p>
<p>In this session I will cover the fundamental differences between Metrics and Logs, and Events and look at where one is useful over the other. </p>
<p>We’ll look at some of the things Microsoft has done in dotnet core to make logging easier, and some of the third-party libraries and tools that aim to make it easier to navigate. </p>
<p>We’ll cover tools like Serilog and Log4Net, along with AppMetrics for capturing application information. We’ll then take a quick look at Grafana, and see how we can make some sense of that information. Finally, we’ll look at Honeycomb.io and how they’re providing actionable insights for distributed systems using events, enabling testing in production. </p>
