<p>If you need a Windows build, you can use SethRobinson Windows binaries.
This fork is based on vancegroup's fork of Chad Austin's Audiere (see "Reasons for Fork" below).
I only made this modernized fork since I wrote a whole sound implementation based on it before finding out that the linux package was based on the (VERY) old and deprecated sourceforge release version 1.9.4. However, maybe this will bring the project back to life, as there are several others on GitHub (and AUR) doing some great work on Audiere (so far, the only central location for that work is here).</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<ul>
<li>Linux download is available on <a href="https://github.com/poikilos/Audiere/releases">releases</a> page. You'll have to download the appropriate tar.gz file then use "Compiling" instructions below.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Differences from original sourceforge version</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are too many to name. See release notes for all releases especially first (1.10.1): <a href="https://github.com/poikilos/Audiere/releases">https://github.com/poikilos/Audiere/releases</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>see doc/tutorial.txt</li>
<li>for Code::Blocks notes (setting up projects to use Audiere as a dependency), see HowTo-poikilos.md</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure make dependencies are installed
(for build tools, your linux distro probably has a package group for building similar to first line of each set of steps below):
<ul>
<li>Debian or Ubuntu (this wasn't tested, so you may need repos or specific PPAs enabled for this to work):
<ul>
<li><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install build-essentials</code></li>
<li><code>sudo apt-get install doxygen</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>arch:
<ul>
<li>do not do the following command if you already need and have multilib-devel metapackage from AUR: <code>sudo pacman -Syu base-devel  # installed by default</code></li>
<li><code>sudo pacman -Syu doxygen</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>formerly, hcc was required for full-release.sh, but  <code>yaourt -Sy hcc</code> wasn't working so I made hcc optional (changed doxygen-dist.sh)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>see also doc/release-howto.txt</li>
<li>see also examples/wxPlayer/IMPORTANT.txt</li>
<li>for compiling cross-platform (non-Windows)
<ul>
<li>if cloned from git, see HowTo-poikilos.md</li>
<li>if downloaded a release version tar.gz from <a href="https://github.com/poikilos/Audiere/releases">releases</a>, this should work:
<pre><code>./bootstrap
./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you want to use scons on non-Windows platform (not recommended for cross-platform) and you don't have libdumb (as expected):
<code>scons use_dumb=no</code>
<ul>
<li>NOTE: using scons will cause so file's name to not have -1.9.4 appended, resulting in programs not running. You would then have to manually rename or link to it and put it in your system with something like <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/libaudiere-1.9.4.so &amp;&amp; ldconfig</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>see doc/changelog.txt</p>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>see doc/dependencies.txt</p>
<h3>Optional Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>alsa-oss (to emulate oss since oss is deprecated--alsa-oss creates /dev/dsp, which Audiere release or AUR version need in order to create a sound device--otherwise Audiere will output an error to the console saying /dev/dsp is missing): this should be optional now because <a href="https://github.com/vancegroup/Audiere">https://github.com/vancegroup/Audiere</a> version has alsa support (from svn 2011 version) and pulse support</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reasons for Fork</h2>
<ul>
<li>last sourceforge release was 2006</li>
<li>there were changes up to 2011 in sourceforge version--but it still requires windows.h when trying to compile on linux via <code>scons use_dumb=no</code></li>
<li><a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/audiere" rel="nofollow">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/audiere</a> was last updated 2015 and has some patches that should be added in some central (non-OS-specific) location</li>
<li>On the feature request to support alsa at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/audiere/feature-requests/67/" rel="nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/p/audiere/feature-requests/67/</a> (noting that at the time, oss was already all but deprecated), anonymous replied "Whatever, patches welcome"--that was in 2007. In svn, also code is availale (see HAS_ALSA define in code, such as device.cpp; coreaudio and pa are also conditionally included there).</li>
<li>latest GitHub fork was 2014 (and didn't compile with wx 3; the later SethRobinson fork doesn't count--it only made changes for MSVC 32-bit &amp; 64-bit compilation, and didn't fork from vancegroup who had done many fixes).
<ul>
<li>and isn't cross-platform</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>CMakeLists.txt has many TODOs that seem important, such as:
<pre><code>if(NOT WIN32)
  # TODO
  # search for libcdaudio
endif()
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>implement fixes for MSVC 32-bit &amp; 64-bit compilation implemented in SethRobinson's fork of <a href="https://github.com/kg/Audiere">https://github.com/kg/Audiere</a> (should have been forked from later fork but wasn't so full diff must be manually applied to current fork)</li>
<li>possible type-o in device_null.h (see "old changes noted during diffs" above)</li>
<li>requires oss (or emulation of /dev/dsp via alsa-oss) which is deprecated</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developer Notes</h2>
<p><code>SOUND_BUFFERS</code> is 15
<code>SOUND_SOURCES</code> is 20</p>
<p>Unicode filenames require an external library such as wx (the following is from <a href="https://github.com/kg/Audiere/blob/master/examples/wxPlayer/DeviceFrame.cpp">https://github.com/kg/Audiere/blob/master/examples/wxPlayer/DeviceFrame.cpp</a>):</p>
<div><pre>#<span>if</span> wxUSE_UNICODE
  wxCharBuffer buffFilename = filename.mb_str(wxConvUTF8);
  audiere::SampleSourcePtr source = audiere::OpenSampleSource(buffFilename.data());
#<span>else</span>
  audiere::SampleSourcePtr source = audiere::OpenSampleSource(filename);
#<span>endif</span></pre></div>
