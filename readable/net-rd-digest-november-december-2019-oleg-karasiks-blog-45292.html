<p>This year was huge for .NET community. We hit .NET Core 3.0 with all it‚Äôs goodies just to find out that .NET Framework 4.8 will be the last framework release. We saw a glimpse of future called .NET 5 where Mono is part of the .NET. We saw / heard multiple talks from multiple conferences and read a lot of blog posts from the internet.</p>



<p>Now the year is coming to its end but there are still some stuff to read and I know, there is nothing better than read some technology blog post on holiday / vacation üòä</p>



<p>Have a good time! See you next year!</p>



<h2>Windows</h2>



<ol><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/CoolWSLWindowsSubsystemForLinuxTipsAndTricksYouOrIDidntKnowWerePossible.aspx" target="_blank">Cool WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) tips and tricks you (or I) didn‚Äôt know were possible</a> <em>(by Scott Hanselman)</em><br>WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is an amazing thing which brought Linux experience to your Windows machine (there is already a WSL2). In this post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/shanselman" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a> share a set of nice tricks (most of them were a nice surprise to me) to make you work with WSL more productive. Recommended to read &amp; bookmark if you are using or planning to use WSL üôÇ</li></ol>



<h2>Performance</h2>



<ol><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-TLSBdHe1A&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">‚ÄúPerformance Matters‚Äù</a><em> (by Emery Berger)</em><br>I think who has ever done performance optimization knows how confusing this process could be. It is really hard to measure things right, to be sure you are really improving performance. In this presentation <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/emeryberger" target="_blank">Emery Berger</a> talks about things that made performance optimizations hard and how to do performance analysis in a right way. Recommended to watch at least to know that changing methods order could affect performance.<p>(I wish I saw this talk a few years ago when I personally faced the layout effect. I thought that I lost my mind.)</p></li></ol>



<h2>Visual Studio</h2>



<ol><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/pinnable-properties-debug-display-managed-objects-your-way/" target="_blank">Pinnable Properties: Debug &amp; Display Managed Objects YOUR Way</a> <em>(by Leslie Richardson)</em><br>Visual Studio has many features to simplify debugging. We can use different <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/how-can-i-pause-my-code-in-visual-studio-breakpoints-faq/" target="_blank">breakpoints</a> to pause the execution. We can print information without modifying the code using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/tracepoints/" target="_blank">tracepoints</a>. We can <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/customize-object-displays-in-the-visual-studio-debugger-your-way/" target="_blank">attribute</a> our classes so Visual Studio will know how to display them. And now, there is more. In this post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/lyrichardson01" target="_blank">Leslie Richardson</a> explains how we can use new Visual Studio ‚ÄúPinnable Properties‚Äù feature to quickly identify objects by changing theirs display at runtime!</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/criteo-labs/wsl-visual-studio-attaching-launching-a-linux-net-core-application-on-my-window-10-ab21c179702d" target="_blank">WSL + Visual Studio = attaching/launching a Linux .NET Core application on Window 10</a> <em>(by Christophe Nasarre)</em><br>.NET Core runs on Linux. Windows has WSL to run Linux. Combining these two pieces make it possible to run .NET Core apps on Linux on Windows, which is great but what about debugging? In this post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/chnasarre" target="_blank">Christophe Nasarre</a> describes how you can debug .NET Core application running on WSL in Visual Studio (using both methods: attach to process and start process).</li></ol>



<h2>.NET</h2>

If yes, then you should know there is no simple answer if you are using C#. The reason why is because there is no resource ownership semantics built in into the language. In this post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/jaredpar" target="_blank">Jared Parsons</a> explores what it would be if C# would have semantics to ‚Äúborrow‚Äù resources (based on the real experience) and why it cannot be easily added to the language now.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/httpclient-connection-pooling-in-dotnet-core" target="_blank">HttpClient connection pooling in .NET Core</a><em> (by Steve Gordon)</em><br>In this post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/stevejgordon" target="_blank">Steve Gordon</a> describes what is HTTP connection pooling and how it works. The post starts from the brief history of <code>HttpClient</code> and then dives into internal details of how connection pooling is implemented in different versions of .NET Framework and .NET Core (spoiler: It is not about <code>IHttpClientFactory</code>).</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://josefottosson.se/you-are-probably-still-using-httpclient-wrong-and-it-is-destabilizing-your-software/" target="_blank">You‚Äôre (probably still) using HttpClient wrong and it is destabilizing your software</a><em> (by Josef Ottosson)</em><br>In this post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/josefffs" target="_blank">Josef Ottosson</a> demonstrated various ways to use <code>HttpClient</code> (from quite straightforward way to typed clients with <code>IHttpClientFactory</code>) by creating multiple versions of the same application. Besides code samples the post also contains detailed explanations of every change and pros / cons section for each implementation version. In the end all these implementations are benchmarked üôÇ</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.strathweb.com/2019/11/using-async-disposable-and-async-enumerable-in-frameworks-older-than-net-core-3-0/" target="_blank">Using async disposable and async enumerable in frameworks older than .NET Core 3.0</a><em> (by Filip W.)</em><br>C# 8 brings a lot of great features. However, most of these goodies are only for .NET Core 3.0 / .NET Standard 2.1 consumers. In this post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/filip_woj" target="_blank">Filip W.</a> describes how you can bring ‚Äòasync enumerable‚Äô features to .NET Standard 2.0 compatible frameworks.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/an-introduction-to-system-threading-channels/" target="_blank">An Introduction to System.Threading.Channels</a><em> (by Stephen Toub)</em><br>Producer / consumer is a very common problem. We face it when processing any chunks of data. Most of the custom solutions I saw were implemented using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.concurrent.blockingcollection-1?view=netframework-4.8" target="_blank">BlockingCollection</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/dataflow-task-parallel-library" target="_blank">TPL DataFlows</a>. These I would say become a standard way to address these scenarios. While <code>BlockingCollection</code> is great for simplest scenario and TPL DataFlows allows you to build very complex data processing pipelines they aren‚Äôt really effective in many quite common producer / consumer scenarios. Some time ago .NET introduced <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/system-io-pipelines-high-performance-io-in-net/" target="_blank">System.IO.Pipelines</a> to handle scenarios involving stream of bytes and now there is also <code>System.Threading.Channels</code> to address the rest of cases. In this post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/stephentoub" target="_blank">Stephen Toub</a> in describes what <code>System.Threading.Channels</code> is, what it‚Äôs API does and how all this thing works internally. The post is very detailed and contains samples, source code snippets and problems definitions. Highly recommended to read.</li></ol>

<h2>Testing</h2>

In this post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/martinfowler" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a> talks about of exploratory testing and why it is important to do it regularly even when you have good automated tests coverage.</li></ol>
