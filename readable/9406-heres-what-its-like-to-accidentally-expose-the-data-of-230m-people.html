"Be careful with your data, and be careful with the people who manage your data," Hardigree says. "I hired some guys that were careless. But at the end of the day it’s the CEO who’s responsible. I take responsibility."</p><p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3">Final Objections</p><p>On some points, however, Hardigree remains defiant. He calls Troia, the researcher who found his exposed data, "not a good guy," and accuses him of tanking Exactis in order to raise his own profile. He points out that Troia contacted WIRED before he contacted Exactis about its data exposure, and sent the company a marketing brochure after his initial email, which Hardigree and his staff saw as a kind of shakedown. He also alleges that Troia may have broken the law by downloading the exposed data—a fairly common practice among security researchers—and again by giving a copy of it to the breach notification service HaveIBeenPwned.com.</p><p>"I could sue him in civil court or press criminal charges but I don’t think it solves anything," Hardigree says. Troia admits that he does feel bad for playing a role in killing Exactis. But he doesn't regret his actions. "If I hadn’t found it, somebody else would have down the line," he says. "At the end of the day, the door was wide open, and he was leaking data on all these people."</p><p>Hardigree also still maintains that the data Exactis aggregated and then exposed wasn't actually sensitive, and that the outrage over its exposure was overblown. He says much of it was pulled from sources like public records and census data. Exactis combined that public information with data it traded for and bought, with sources ranging from payday loan and auto companies to surveys to registration forms for business publications. Hardigree claims that hundreds of small companies possess similar data. He argues that anyone can buy a less refined version of the same collection, what's known as a Consumer Master File, for around $1,000. "This data is out there, and it always has been out there," Hardigree says.</p><p>But Troy Hunt, the security researcher and data breach expert who manages HaveIBeenPwned, says that the Exactis data was indeed sensitive enough to justify the wave of pain that hit the company after its security lapse. He argues the data is, in fact, sufficiently detailed to contribute to identity theft, and certainly detailed enough to creep out anyone who finds themselves in it.</p><p>"I'm playing a very small violin right now," Hunt says of Exactis' post-exposure troubles. "They’re saying ‘look, we went and scraped up a bunch of people’s data without their expectation it would be used in this way, and certainly without any informed consent. Then we failed to secure it properly. Now we’re upset something bad happened to us as a result.' They're not going to get much sympathy from anyone for that."</p><p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3">The New Normal</p><p>But Hunt does agree with at least one of Hardigree's points: A growing mass of startups that does seem to possess and analyze outsized amounts of consumer data that wouldn't have previously been possible for small firms. He points to both <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apollo-breach-linkedin-salesforce-data/">Apollo.io</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/email-marketing-company-809-million-records-exposed-online/">Verifications.io</a> as examples of obscure firms who have recently exposed massive troves of consumer data. Verifications.io, for instance, seems to have been so fly-by-night that it responded to its data leak by taking down its website, and hasn't restored it since.</p><p>You can thank cloud services and computing advances for that mismatch between the size of a company and the amount of data it can hold, says Hardigree. "You used to need supercomputers to do this. Now you can do it from a PC," he says.</p><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><p role="heading" aria-level="4" class="heading-h4">LEARN MORE</p><figure class="asset-embed"></figure></div><p>The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, which tracks US data breaches, says it didn't possess data about the size of the companies that spilled 1.37 billion records total in just the last year. But the group's policy counsel Emory Roane says that given technological advances and a lack of accompanying regulations, an uptick in big breaches from small firms seems like a natural outcome. "I'm not at all surprised that there are companies like Verifications.io and Exactis all over the country that have bought or are able to collect extreme-hoarding levels of data," Roane says. "It's possible because of the technology, but also because we don’t have strong protections."</p></div></div></div></div>
