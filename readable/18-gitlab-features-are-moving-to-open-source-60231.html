        <p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/03/30/new-features-to-core/">https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/03/30/new-features-to-core/</a></p>
        <hr/>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I spent some time reviewing GitLab features and determined that, by our <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#the-likely-type-of-buyer-determines-what-features-go-in-what-tier">Buyer-Based Open Core</a> model, eighteen features that appear in seven different stages of the DevOps lifecycle ought to be open source.</p>
<p>When we rolled out our Buyer-Based Open Core model in 2018, what we laid out is that features are assigned to each of our four individual tiers based on who the buyer of the feature is.
Features that serve an individual contributor land in Core/Free.
Features for managers land in Starter/Bronze, for directors in Premium/Silver, and executives in Ultimate/Gold.
As we explain the reasoning on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#the-likely-type-of-buyer-determines-what-features-go-in-what-tier">our pricing page</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The feature is put in the plan based on what champion is most likely to <strong>care</strong> about it.
Buyers make sense, since a higher-cost plan needs a higher-placed buyer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pricing model has served us well, and we've been committed to it.
But, somewhere along the way, we failed to do an audit of many existing features.
That's what I did last month, and now I'm excited to share that after personally reviewing all features in each of our tiers <strong>we are open sourcing an unprecedented number of GitLab features</strong>.</p>
<p>This marks a major milestone in our efforts to empower the community to collaborate more robustly and to take our single tool for the DevOps lifecycle to the next level.
From design management to package managers, managing multiple Kubernetes clusters to connecting related issues, we're making it easier than ever for an individual contributor to have everything they need to plan, build, deploy, and secure their application with GitLab.</p>
<h2 id="its-not-enough-to-talk-the-talk--we-need-to-walk-the-walk">It's not enough to talk the talk – we need to walk the walk.</h2>
<p>If we're saying that <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#four-tiers">our features are based on the buyer</a>, then we need to make sure that the right features are in the right place.
We've always been committed to our <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/stewardship/#how-open-source-benefits-from-open-core">stewardship</a> of GitLab as an open source project.
By auditing the tier of features, we can better serve our open source community while more accurately aligning our business model.
Our commitment to the open source community is why we will always work to <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#well-always-move-features-down">move features down our tiers</a>
and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#if-a-feature-can-be-moved-down-do-it-quickly">doing so quickly</a> and consistently.</p>
<h2 id="we-hope-to-unleash-the-power-of-everyones-creativity">We hope to unleash the power of everyone’s creativity</h2>
<p>Our mission has always been that <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/#mission">everyone can contribute</a>.
With new functionality available to all users, it's easier than ever to contribute - contribute with GitLab, contribute to GitLab the application, or contribute to GitLab the company.
See something, submit a Merge Request (MR).</p>
<p>We recognize that many users in our community have creative ideas on how to make GitLab an even better product.
By partnering with the open-source community, we can open-source features even more quickly.</p>
<h2 id="whats-moving">What's moving?</h2>
<p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/dev-ops-plan-to-monitor.png" alt="devops lifecycle"></p>
<p>Features from Plan, Create, Verify, Package, Release, Configure, and Defend are moving.
This is <em>a lot</em> of features.
While we've outlined all of these features that are ready to be moved to Core/Free, we need your help to move them.</p>
<p>The work to move the actual code to the open source part of the codebase is defined in issues that are linked from this blog post. These issues will go into the backlog for each of the respective product development teams and will be prioritized against new feature development.
If having this functionality in Core/Free is important to you, we invite you to contribute yourself to speed up the process.
We're not just giving you permission to help us move this code - we're asking you to help us move it.</p>
<h4 id="synchronize-collaboration-with-plan">Synchronize collaboration with <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/features/#plan">Plan</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/">Issues</a> are the primary way people collaborate on ideas and plan work in GitLab.
By open sourcing these new features, we're making it easier than ever to plan your projects.
We can't wait to see what you come up with.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/related_issues.html#related-issues">Related issues</a>: Connect related issues together.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/csv_export.html">Export issues</a>: Export issues from GitLab as a CSV and receive the CSV as an attachment to your default notification email.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html#focus-mode-starter">Issue board focus mode</a>: Use this tool to plan, organize, and visualize a workflow for a feature or product release. It can be used as a Kanban or a Scrum board.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/service_desk.html#service-desk-premium">Service desk</a> allows your team to connect directly with any external party through email right inside of GitLab –
no external tools required.
With that, the complexity and inefficiencies of multiple tools are eliminated, significantly shortening the cycle time from feedback to software updates.
We would love to hear how you leverage service desk in your workflows now that it's open source.</p>

<h4 id="build-better-code-and-branch-powerfully-with-create">Build better code and branch powerfully with <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/features/#create">Create</a></h4>
<p>The machine you're using shouldn't limit how easy it is to develop.</p>
<p>We're excited to bring down two features for developing in web-first environments.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/index.html#interactive-terminals-for-the-web-ide-ultimate">Web Terminal for Web IDE</a> makes it faster and easier to contribute changes to projects.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/#file-syncing-to-web-terminal">File syncing to web terminal</a> in the Web IDE helps you test code changes in a preconfigured terminal environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/design_management.html#design-management-premium">Design management</a> allows you to upload design assets (wireframes, mockups, etc.) to GitLab issues and keep them stored in one single place, accessed by the Design management’s page within an issue, ensuring issues are the single source of truth for everything required to develop a feature.</p>
<p>All together, these changes to create should make it easier to go from wireframe to MVC in the blink of an eye – independent of what machine you're on –&nbsp;improving project efficiency.</p>

<p>We hope that by open sourcing these features we will make it easier for all users to treat GitLab as a single application for the entire DevOps lifecycle. <strong>We are thrilled about the limitless possibilities ahead of us as a community and we're looking forward to collaborating closely with each of you!</strong></p>
