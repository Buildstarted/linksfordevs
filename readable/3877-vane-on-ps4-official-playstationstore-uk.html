As they do so, the world reacts to their passage, evolving and building into something altogether different. </p><p>From the team at Friend &amp; Foe Games, Vane is a uniquely unnerving take on adventure games.  Developed with the conviction that players should find their own path through the world, the result is a minimalistic, stark environment that encourages exploration just to the edge of getting lost, all set to an all-original brooding synth soundtrack.</p><p>1 player<br>4GB minimum save size<br>HD Video Output 720p,1080i,1080p</p><p>Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.
