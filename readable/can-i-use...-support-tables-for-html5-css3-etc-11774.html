                    <h3>About</h3>

                    <p>"Can I use" provides up-to-date browser support tables for support of front-end web technologies on desktop and mobile web browsers.</p>

                    <p>The site was built and is maintained by <a href="http://a.deveria.com/">Alexis Deveria</a>, with occasional updates provided by the <a href="https://github.com/fyrd/caniuse">web development community</a>. The design used as of 2014 was largely created by <a href="http://www.lensco.be/">Lennart Schoors</a>. </p>

                    <h3>FAQ</h3>

                    <h4>May I use your data in my presentation/article/site, etc?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes, the support data on this site is free to use under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> license.
                    </p>

					<h4>Is there a way to see the support data in colors other than red/green?</h4>
					<p>
						Yes, you can enable accessible colors from <a href="https://caniuse.com/#accessible_colors=1">this link</a> or from the option under Settings. This color scheme will be used again on revisit.
					</p>

                    <h4>Do you have the data available in a raw format?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes, the raw support data is available on <a href="https://github.com/fyrd/caniuse">GitHub</a> and is updated regularly.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Could you add <i>feature X</i> to the site?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Adding features takes quite some time and there are many requests for additions.
                        Because of this I use <a href="https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/issues">GitHub issues</a> to manage requests.
                        Feel free to add/vote for your feature there.
                    </p>
					<p>If you've done the research yourself already, you can also <a href="https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">submit a feature</a> on GitHub.</p>

					<h4>Could you cover email clients too so I can see what I can use in HTML emails?</h4>
					<p>
						That certainly sounds useful, but for now I only intend to take on web browser support.
					</p>

                    <h4>Which features do you choose to add to this list?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I use the following criteria:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Useful to web designers/developers</li>
                        <li>Likely to be eventually implemented by the majority of browsers </li>
						<li><em>Not</em> already fully supported in even old browsers. These features can be made searchable but will not include support tables.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Most features are added in priority order from <a href="http://caniuse.com/issue-list">this list</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How do you test support?</h4>
                    <p>I use a hand-crafted test suite to test features, which tests for basic support of each feature. </p>
                    <p>The test suite is publicly available at <a href="http://tests.caniuse.com/">tests.caniuse.com</a>.</p>

                    <h4>Where do you get your information for upcoming versions?</h4>
                    <p>Most information comes directly from the latest developer/preview/nightly builds. </p>

                    <h4>When is a feature considered "supported"?</h4>
                    <p>When its primary purpose is largely fulfilled. It does not mean it's 100% supported, just that it's usable in most cases.</p>

                    <h4>How often is this page updated?</h4>
                    <p>I try to keep it as current as possible, with new information being usually being processed within a few days. Follow the <a href="https://caniuse.com/feed.php">feed</a> if you'd like keep up with all the changes made.</p>
