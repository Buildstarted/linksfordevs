The token can be used to obtain a variety of advertising and attention-based services on the BAT platform and the <a href="https://brave.com/" class="dj by ie if ig ih" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brave</a> browser.</p><p id="b358" class="gt gu em at gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg ee">Along with the series of educational videos where you can learn more about the Brave browser and BAT, customers will also have the option to earn BAT by using the Brave browser. We hope this will encourage people to explore and use utility tokens first-hand in their native environments, like the Brave browser.</p><p id="4c0c" class="gt gu em at gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg ee">We see these interactive, advanced lessons in cryptocurrencies and tokens as an important step toward building awareness and usage of utility use-cases in the crypto ecosystem–one where a beginner can quickly get up to speed on a token in a few minutes, actually engage with the product, and earn some of that token along the way. We think learning about crypto and earning crypto is a great way to get people to evaluate and use more utility tokens without having to buy them outright.</p><p id="6a8f" class="gt gu em at gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg ee">We expect earning to become an increasingly important function in the crypto ecosystem– alongside buying and mining– especially when paired with education. We hear from people that they’re always looking for trusted sources to educate themselves about new developments in crypto, and we want to help serve that need.</p><p id="a358" class="gt gu em at gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg ee">If you haven’t received an invite yet, don’t worry — you can still view all content on the <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/earn/basic-attention-token?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=medium&amp;utm_campaign=bat_launch" class="dj by ie if ig ih" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Earn BAT page</a> for free, and you can join the waitlist to be notified once earning opportunities become available to you. If you want to stay informed about future opportunities, please make sure you have verified your identity and opted in to marketing communications with Coinbase!</p><p id="2404" class="gt gu em at gv b gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg ee">Lastly, you can check out the newly launched <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/earn?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=medium&amp;utm_campaign=launch" class="dj by ie if ig ih" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Earn</a> homepage to keep up to date with the latest Earn opportunities.</p></div></div></div></div>
