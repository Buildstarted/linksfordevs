<p><img src="https://tirania.org/images/Unity-Editor-Breakdown.png" width="240"></p><p>The Unity3D engine features a capability where developers can edit the
code for their program, hit “play” and observe the changes right away,
without a visible compilation step.  C# code is compiled and executed
immediately inside the Unity editor in a seamless way.</p>
<p>This is a scenario where scripted code runs with full trust within the
original application.  The desired outcome is to not crash the host,
be able to reload new versions of the code over and over, and not
really about providing a security boundary.</p>
<p>This capability was built into Unity using .NET Application Domains: a
code isolation technology that was originally built in .NET that
allowed code to be loaded, executed and discarded after it was no
longer needed.</p>
<p>Other developers used Application Domains as a security boundary in
conjuction with other security technologies in .NET.  But this
combination turned out to have some holes, and Application Domains,
once popular among .NET developers, fell from grace.</p>
<p>With .NET Core, Application domains are no longer supported, and
alternative options for code-reloading have been created (dynamic
loading of code can be achieved these days with AssemblyLoadContext).</p>
<p>While Unity was ahead of the industry in terms of code hot reloading,
but other folks have used embedded runtimes to provide this sort of
capability over the years, Javascript being one of the most popular
ones.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been fascinated by WebAssembly for solving this
particular scenario and solve it very well (some folks are also using
WebAssembly to isolate sensitive code).</p>
<p>WebAssembly was popularized by the Web crowd, and it offers a number
of capabilities that neither Javascript, Application Domains or other
scripting languages solve very well for scripting applications.</p>
<p>Outside of the Web browser domain, WebAssembly checks all of the boxes
in my book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides great code isolation and memory isolation</li>
<li>Easily discard unused code and data</li>
<li>Wide reach: in addition to being available on the Web there are runtimes suitable for
almost every scenario: fast JIT compilation, optimizing compilers,
static compilation and assorted interpreters.   One of my favorites is <a href="https://wasmer.io/">Wasmer</a></li>
<li>Custom operations can be surfaced to WebAssembly to connect the
embedded code with the host.</li>
<li>Many languages can target this runtime.  C, C++, C#, F#, Go, Rust
and Swift among others.</li>
</ul>
<p>WebAssembly is low-level enough that it does not come with a garbage
collector, which means that it will not pause to garbage collect your
code like .NET/Mono or JavaScript would.  That depends entirely on the
language that you run inside WebAssembly.  If you run C, Rust or Swift
code, there would be no time taken by a garbage collector, but if you
run .NET or Go code there would be.</p>
<p>Going back to the Unity scenario: the fascinating feature for me, is
that IDEs/Editors/Tools could leverage WebAssembly to host their
favorite language for scripting during the development stage, but for
the final build of a product (like Unity, Godot, Rhino3D, Unreal
Engine and really any other application that offers scripting
capabilities) they could bundle the native code without having to take
a WebAssembly dependency.</p>
<p>For the sake of the argument, imagine the Godot game engine.  Today
Godot has support for GodotScript and .NET.  But it could be extended
to support for Swift for scripting, and use WebAssembly during
development to hot-reload the code, but generate Swift code directly
for the final build of a game.</p>
<p>The reason I listed the game engines here is that users of those
products are as happy with the garbage collector taking some time to
tidy up your heap as they are with a parent calling them to dinner
just as they are swarming an enemy base during a 2-hour campaign.</p>
<p>WebAssembly is an incredibly exciting space, and every day it seems
like it opens possibilities that we could only dream of before.</p>
