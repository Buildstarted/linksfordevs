However, the alert may delay or interfere with or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent requests or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, insurance, rental housing, employment, investment, license, cellular phone, utilities, digital signature, internet credit card transactions or other services, including extension of credit or services at point of sale.</p><p>When you place a security freeze on your file, you will be provided a personal identification number or password to use if you choose to remove the security freeze from your file or authorize the temporary release of your credit report for a specific person or period after the security freeze is in place. If you are actively seeking credit, you should understand that the procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your own application for credit.</p><p>You should plan ahead and lift a freeze, either completely if you are shopping around, or specifically for a certain creditor, a few days before actually applying for new credit. To find out the specific requirements for placing a security freeze on your credit report, please <a href="/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/preventing-fraud/security-freeze/">visit our freeze information page</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>
