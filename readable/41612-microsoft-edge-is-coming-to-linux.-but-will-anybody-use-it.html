Release candidates for the new Chromium-based Edge build are available on consumer and server versions of Windows (including Windows 7 and Server 2008, which have already left mainstream support), as well as MacOS, Android, and iOS.</p>
<p>Sharper-eyed attendees also noticed a promise for future Linux support.</p>

But Linux? Sure, why not.</div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Curious folks can <a href="https://microsoftedgeinsider.com/download/">download</a> canary or beta versions of the new Edge for most operating systems from <a href="https://microsoftedgeinsider.com/">Microsoft Edge Insider</a>&#x2014;although there&apos;s nothing there yet for Linux. Browsing the Edge Insider site from Chrome on Linux replaces the download button with &quot;Not supported for Linux.&quot; Using Firefox instead presents you with a download button for the Windows 10 version, presumably due to that browser&apos;s newly enhanced privacy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/firefox-is-stepping-up-its-blocking-game/">controls</a>.</p>
<p>We downloaded the Edge beta on a Windows Server 2012 R2 VM and took it for a quick spin. So far, it looks very much like Chrome itself&#x2014;enough so that you might not notice which browser you&apos;re using unless you look very specifically.</p> <div class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide"> <ul> <li> <figure> <figcaption id="caption-1600117"> <span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"></span> <div class="caption"> Chrome and the new Edge Beta are both running here on Server 2012. Yes, you can tell which one is which... but you really have to work at it. </div> </figcaption> </figure> </li> <li> <figure> <figcaption id="caption-1600123"> <span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"></span> <div class="caption"> Part of new Edge&apos;s setup process is choosing a tab view&#x2014;which sounds confusing, until you realize it just means what&apos;s on <em>new</em> tab pages. &quot;Inspirational&quot; tabs means &quot;new tabs with neat wallpaper,&quot; basically. </div> </figcaption> </figure> </li> <li> <figure> <figcaption id="caption-1600121"> <span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"></span> <div class="caption"> &quot;Informational&quot; tabs means &quot;yes, please, to all the marketing on new tabs&quot; if you&apos;re as cynical as we are. </div> </figcaption> </figure> </li> <li> <figure> <figcaption id="caption-1600119"> <span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"></span> <div class="caption"> &quot;Focused&quot; tabs gets you something akin to Google Chrome&apos;s default new tab view&#x2014;light on the frou-frou backgrounds and helpful links to media sites alike. </div> </figcaption> </figure> </li> <li> <figure> <figcaption id="caption-1600125"> <span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"></span> <div class="caption"> The Chromium-derived Edge immediately offered to suck up data from other browsers, including Google Chrome. Microsoft didn&apos;t even need to write any code for that; the functionality is already in Chromium. </div> </figcaption> </figure> </li> </ul> </div> <p>For the moment, it doesn&apos;t look like there&apos;s much to get excited about in Edge&apos;s new Chromium flavor&#x2014;it&apos;s pretty much just Chromium with one additional button that lets you go to your Favorites and another smiley-face button that sends feedback to developers. Browsing to <code>chrome://extensions</code> redirects you to <code>edge://extensions</code> and presents you with an offer to head to the Microsoft Store to find some. The profile button, similarly, takes you to a Microsoft login page rather than a Google one.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that the Linux world is going to go ga-ga for what seems to essentially be a reskinning of Chromium&#x2014;but that might be missing Microsoft&apos;s real thrust here. Many developers&#x2014;including Linux developers&#x2014;choose Azure over rival cloud services like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, and bringing Edge to Linux may represent little more than a way to offer those developers deeper ties into Microsoft&apos;s profile and identity management services.</p>
<p>If a developer already has and uses Azure authentication for work, the ability to tie that authentication directly to the browser itself may be just enough to make Edge interesting.</p> <p><em>Listing image by Jim Salter</em></p> </div>
