	                            <p>The concept of observability has caught fire in the last few years, both in DevOps and monitoring circles. You may already be familiar with observability operations, which include logging, tracing, and displaying metrics. But how do you do those three things well?</p><p>Here's a list of current and relevant online resources to help guide you on logging, tracing, and metrics. Go back to your team armed with these resources and you're sure to spark some ideas on how to handle your own <a href="https://content.microfocus.com/itops-monitoring-tb/centralize-it-ops?lx=O4Iukj&amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;utm_campaign=00134846" target="_blank">monitoring challenges</a>.</p><p><em>[ Get up to speed on Enterprise Service Management products <a href="https://content.microfocus.com/l/buyers-guide-esm-tools-special-report-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=00172425" target="_blank">with TechBeacon's Buyer's Guide</a>.

He describes each pillar while also providing his own opinions on their advantages and disadvantages. The instrumentation and monitoring pillar is also called "metrics" by some.</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/monitoring-in-the-time-of-cloud-native-c87c7a5bfa3e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Monitoring in the time of Cloud Native</a></h4><p>For the most comprehensive look at the modern state of observability and monitoring, <a href="https://twitter.com/copyconstruct" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cindy </a><a href="https://twitter.com/copyconstruct" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sridharan</a>'s content is required reading. The article introduces the concept of observability, defines the three pillars of modern observability—logging, request tracing, and metrics collection—and describes when you might consider using each pillar. "<a href="https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/logs-and-metrics-6d34d3026e38" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Logs and Metrics</a>" is another good post by Sridharan on just those two pillars. It's shorter, but it gives more concise information, not all of which is in the other article. She has also written a free e-book on this topic called <em><a href="http://distributed-systems-observability-ebook.humio.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Distributed Systems Observability</a></em>.</p><p><em>Black-box vs. white-box monitoring.</em></p><h4><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/metrics-are-dead/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metrics are Dead?</a></h4><p>After attending the Monitorama conference, <a href="https://twitter.com/pauldix" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paul Dix</a> shared some useful opinions and advice on the relevance of metrics (what he calls "regular time series") in modern monitoring. This&nbsp;article shares some helpful angles for looking at each of the three monitoring pillars. It concludes that while tracing is more useful for microservices,&nbsp;in more common monolithic architectures, metrics, events, and logs are king.</p><h3>Logging</h3><h4><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/you-should-have-better-logging-now-fbab2f667fac" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">An introduction to logging for programmers</a></h4><p>FreeCodeCamp is a great publication to learn from if you're a beginner developer. Anyone dealing with operations and debugging should know how logging works, and this article is a wonderful start for anyone who hasn't learned how to do it. The author, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefvardalos/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stefanos Vardalos</a>, defines diagnostic and audit logging while also sharing some example logging tools for back-end and front-end development.</p><h4><a href="https://www.loggly.com/ultimate-guide/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Logging —&nbsp;The Ultimate Guide</a></h4><p>This resource isn't just one article, but an entire site. It was created by Loggly, a log management vendor, but the content is vendor-neutral and community-maintained. There are nine sections: .NET, Apache, Java, Linux, Node.js, PHP, Python, Systemd, and Windows. Each section has a guide to the basics and discussions on&nbsp;how to analyze or parse logs, how to troubleshoot common issues, and how to centralize or aggregate logs in a distributed system.</p><h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0x05cpEME8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Un-broken logging —&nbsp;the foundation of operability</a></h4><p><a href="https://twitter.com/matthewpskelton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Matthew Skelton</a> shares excellent insights on modern logging in this talk. The key, he says, is using the right transaction identifiers so that calls can be traced across components, services, and queues. He also has another good article on<a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/why-test-logging" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> why and how you should test logging</a>.</p><h4><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/2017/04/lies-my-parents-told-me-about-logs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lies My Parents Told Me (About Logs)</a></h4><p>The Honeycomb.io blog is an excellent place to find log management content. Many of its&nbsp;posts focus on promoting structured logging, and although Honeycomb.io is a product vendor, many posts are product-agnostic.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charity Majors</a>, a co-founder of Honeycomb.io, wrote the "Lies My Parents Told Me" post, which explores 11 assumptions about logs and why they're bad.</p><p>Other strong articles from the blog include "<a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/2017/10/you-could-have-invented-structured-logging/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">You Could Have Invented Structured Logging</a>," an explanation and demo of testable structured logging with fewer than 30 lines of code;&nbsp;"<a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/2018/01/simple-structured-logging-with-nlog/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simple Structured Logging with NLog</a>," another example of structured logging using the .NET logging library NLog;&nbsp;and "<a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/2018/02/structured-logging-and-your-team/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">From 1 service to over 50 today</a>,"&nbsp;a case study of how Snyk built a logging system that allows any developer on the team to efficiently troubleshoot any type of issue while working remotely.</p><h4><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/i-heart-logs-realtime-stream-processing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Logs and real-time stream processing</a></h4><p>This article is a free excerpt from the book <em><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/i-heart-logs/9781491909379/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">I Heart Logs: Event Data, Stream Processing, and Data Integration</a>,</em> by<a href="https://twitter.com/jaykreps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Jay Kreps</a>. The book was<a href="https://www.bennadel.com/blog/3349-i-heart-logs-event-data-stream-processing-and-data-integration-by-jay-kreps.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> favorably reviewed</a> by veteran developer and blogger&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/BenNadel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ben Nadel</a>.

The post helps you ask the right questions regarding logging and metrics while understanding the potential pitfalls. Learn what metrics make sense, when to start instrumenting your code, what you should log, what level of detail you should log at, and where your logs should go.</p><h4><a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/9/python-logging" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A guide to logging in Python</a></h4><p>For application-level logging, you'll want to look at the documentation of the language and framework you're using to see which&nbsp;built-in logging capabilities they have before you start looking for external libraries. Some languages are easier to work with in terms of logging than others;&nbsp;I've heard developers call Java logging "a mess"&nbsp;on more than one occasion. So I shared a Python-based logging introduction for this article, since Python is widely regarded as an excellent learner's language. In this tutorial, <a href="https://twitter.com/mariocj89" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mario Corchero</a> dissects the Python logging module and shows you how to use, configure, and extend it.</p><h4><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/building-central-logging-service/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Building A Central Logging Service In-House</a></h4><p><a href="https://akhil.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Akhil Labudubariki</a>, an engineer at BrowserStack, shares a story about how his company built a central logging service tool in-house.

Each metric comes with a definition, an explanation of why it's important, and a graphical illustration. The 10&nbsp;metrics are&nbsp;availability, reliability (mean time between failures and&nbsp;mean time to repair), response time, throughput, security, capacity, scalability, latency, service/help desk, and cost per customer.</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/the-mon-ifesto-part-1-metrics-808f6c944765" rel="nofollow">The </a><a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/the-mon-ifesto-part-1-metrics-808f6c944765" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mon-</a><a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/the-mon-ifesto-part-1-metrics-808f6c944765" rel="nofollow">ifesto</a></h4><p>Peter Christian Fraedrich of Capital One writes about his own team's favorite metrics: calls per minute, error rate, response time, and bandwidth saturation. After introducing these four measures, and his views on metrics in general, he continues with two other articles on <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/the-mon-ifesto-part-2-alerting-and-graphing-bf51828a008f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">alerting and graphing</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/the-mon-ifesto-part-3-alert-response-and-post-mortem-cd227c684ac0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">alert responses and post-mortems</a>.</p><blockquote><p>"Gone are the days where engineers wake up in the middle of the night to respond to Nagios alerts on CPU or Memory. Collect everything, alert on four things, correlate everything. We can take this 'shortcut'&nbsp;because if there’s a problem — a real problem — on one of our app hosts, the symptoms will bubble up into one of our four key metrics."<br>—<a href="https://twitter.com/peter_fraedrich" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Peter Christian Fraedrich</a></p></blockquote><h4><a href="https://blog.wallaroolabs.com/2018/02/building-low-overhead-metrics-collection-for-high-performance-systems/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Building low-overhead metrics collection for high-performance systems</a></h4><p>Gathering metrics always has a performance overhead associated with it. The developers of Wallaroo, an open-source data processing framework, share some of the challenges you run into when trying to reduce the overhead of gathering metrics. The post primarily focuses on the choices the Wallaroo team made when deciding what kinds of metrics to gather and how to display them.</p><h4><a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/timeseries-metric-graphs-101/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metric Graphs 101</a></h4><p>Displaying metrics in an easily digestible format is half the battle when it comes to observability. <a href="https://twitter.com/jmtsn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">John Matson</a> has a great three-part series on graphing metrics that should put you in a position to make better decisions about how you want to visualize your monitoring metrics.

Since GitLab follows a doctrine of radical transparency, nearly all of its internal knowledge base is online for all to see. This document gives you an idea of the tools it&nbsp;uses and the processes it has for monitoring, but it's not an article—you'll have to poke around to see if there are&nbsp;any useful ideas you can use.</p><h4><a href="https://sysdig.com/blog/prometheus-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prometheus Metrics</a></h4><p>Prometheus is a popular set of open-source tools and standards for monitoring in the cloud-native space.
