<p>At Xamarin Developer Summit, Jon talks with <a href="https://twitter.com/jlaban">Jerome Laban</a> about building applications that run everywhere using the Uno Platform. </p>
<ul><li>(00:20) Jerome explains that the Uno Platform is XAML and C# for iOS, Android and WebAssembly using WinUI XAML. On iOS and Android, it&#x2019;s running on Xamarin.</li><li>(01:25) Jerome tells the history of the platform, and how they&#x2019;ve been working on the platform for six years. When the team at nventive saw WebAssembly support coming, they ported their existing framework to run there, too. </li><li>(02:55) The Uno Platform is free and open source; nventive is a service agency that offers development and support for the platform. Jon asks for more information about nventive. It started as a training and general development company, then did Windows Phone, Windows 8 and Windows 10 applications. When Windows Phone went away, they moved their focus to Xamarin development, predating Xamarin Forms. They believe the strucucture of Uno and UWP is often a better approach for them than Xamarin Forms.</li><li>(04:55) Jon asks for the relationship between Uno and Xamarin Forms. Jerome explains that they&#x2019;re generally at the same layer. However, since Uno implements the UWP contract, anything that targets the UWP contract can run on Uno. Xamarin Forms has a part that implements that contract to run on Windows. So&#x2026; a Xamarin Forms can run on WebAssembly using Uno. You can run Uno components in a Xamarin app, since Uno components are actually Xamarin classic components. You can also run Xamarin components in an Uno application.</li><li>(07:00) Jon asks how the XAML front end is run in the browser. Jerome says that Uno renders the XAML as HTML elements. If you view source, it&#x2019;s mostly div&#x2019;s. HTML is treated as a subsystem that&#x2019;s abstracted away.</li><li>(08:37) Jon asks about the Calculator application. The Uno team took the Microsoft open source calculator application, written in C++ and XAML, and got it to run on Uno. Jon was very impressed to bring it up on his phone&#x2019;s browser. Jerome says that works on Android in the browser, and there are also Android and iOS applications.</li><li>(09:35) Jon asks how they ported Calc to Uno. Jerome said that the tricky part was to pinvoke into C and C++ from a WebAssembly module &#x2013; Jerome had to add that support and submitted the pull request to Mono. There are three parts &#x2013; a calculation that dates back to 1999 / Windows 3 that is all C and C++ code that they didn&#x2019;t change; the rest is C++ 11 code which they translated to C# using regular expressions. The XAML and resources are the same.</li><li>(12:20) The Calculator is in published in 65 languages, so they are getting bug reports in 65 languages. There&#x2019;s good accessibility support, so for instance you can enable voiceover in the mobile application.</li><li>(13:10) Jon asks how to build an application for Uno Platform. Jerome explains the File / New Project process using the extension.</li><li>(13:55) Jon asks about deployment. For iOS and Android, the output is the same as any Xamarin project; it&#x2019;s just a standard UWP application, and for WebAssembly it currently tags along with the Blazor tooling.</li><li>(15:00) Jon asks about other getting started information. Jerome runs through several, and points to the GitHub repo for more links.</li><li>(16:20) Jon wraps up with a callout to UnoConf on September 19-20, as well as plans for a 2020 UnoConf in the works.</li></ul>
