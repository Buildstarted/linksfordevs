<p>With the new pre-release version of Xamarin.Forms that just came out, you can now use animated GIF images! Of course it is super obvious what you can do with that, in this post I will show you how!</p>



<p>The support for animated GIF has been a long time coming, but recently <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the PR (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pull/7330" target="_blank">the PR</a> was cleaned up and merged into the repository. You can now use this from version 4.4-pre3 and up on iOS, Android and UWP.</p>



<h2>How to use a GIF</h2>



<p>Actually, this is the seriously easy part: just load it into the existing <strong>Image</strong> control! You have probably worked with images before, thatâ€™s also how it works for GIF images. Add it to the platforms projects, or as an embedded resource in the shared project and use it like a regular image.</p>



<p>Thatâ€™s all basically. The API on the <strong>Image</strong> control has been extended with the <strong>IsAnimationPlaying</strong> property. Simply set that to true to see the GIF do its magic!</p>



<p>This property can also be used to bind your property to. That means you can control if your animation is playing in accordance with your MVVM pattern.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here is a GIF of a Xamarin.Forms app playing a GIF. GIF-ception if you will.</p>



<div><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20%20%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Untitled.gif" alt="A GIF showing a GIF in a Xamarin.Forms app"><figcaption>A GIF showing a GIF in a Xamarin.Forms app</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In the above sample my animation just plays once and is not looping. That is why it might look a bit weird. If you have a looping animation, that should work just fine as well.</p>



<p>The code for this little sample app can be found on my GitHub: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/jfversluis/AnimatedGifForms" target="_blank">https://github.com/jfversluis/AnimatedGifForms</a>.</p>



<h2>Good to know</h2>



<p>There are a couple of things that are good to know. For UWP this only works from SDK 1607 and up, which is also the UWP version recommended to use with Xamarin.Forms as a whole.</p>



<p>For Android the support is only implemented for the Fast Renderers. While the Fast Renderers are turned on by default for a while now, if you have the Legacy Renderers flag turned on you will not see the animation.</p>



<h2>In closing</h2>



<p>The popularity of these animated images has never been higher, so it was about time that you could finally use them with Forms. If youâ€™re looking for some more advanced animations you might want to have a look at the Lottie plugin. I <a href="https://blog.verslu.is/xamarin/xamarin-forms-xamarin/xamarin-app-lottie-animations/">blogged about that</a> a while ago.</p>



<p>What do you think about this support? Liking it? Does it miss any features? Please let me know!</p>
