<p>Now you can shop for StreetEasy user accounts on the dark web.</p>
<p>In an email to users Tuesday, StreetEasy said login information for accounts on the site had been hacked by an &#x201C;unauthorized party&#x201D; and are currently for sale on the dark web. The company said some financial information might also have been accessed in the hack.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The stolen data includes email addresses, usernames, and encrypted passwords,&#x201D; StreetEasy&#x2019;s communications director, Emily Heffter, said in a statement. &#x201C;In our investigation, we determined that phone numbers, the last four digits, card type, expiration dates and billing addresses of some mostly expired customer credit cards may also have been accessed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Heffter said the hacked information did not include full credit card numbers or CVV/CVC codes.</p>
<p>An unknown hacker is currently selling one million stolen StreetEasy accounts on the dark web alongside information stolen from other sites including MyFitnessPal, Houzz and ClassPass, according to reporting from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/16/classpass-gfycat-streeteasy-hacks/">Tech Crunch</a>. It is not clear when the hack took place.</p>
<p>The same hacker is responsible for posting 841 million records for sale on the dark web, stolen from 30 different companies, according to the tech-news site. A review by TechCrunch did not find any financial data in the hacked information.</p>
<p>StreetEasy said the hacked information was stored on a 2016 database backup. In its email, the company encouraged &#x201C;potentially exposed users&#x201D; to reset their passwords, and to monitor their credit card accounts for unauthorized activity.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are taking a number of actions to strengthen our internal safeguards to protect against future attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems,&#x201D; Heffter said, but declined to comment on specific steps the company will take.</p>
<p>In August 2018, StreetEasy was targeted as part of <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2018/08/30/streeteasy-maps-hit-by-jewtropolis-hack/">an anti-Semitic hack</a> that also targeted Snapchat, Citi Bike and the New York Times. All the sites were using maps from the third-party company Mapbox. The hacker changed the display name on their maps from Manhattan to &#x201C;Jewtropolis.&#x201D; The attack affected StreetEasy&#x2019;s building pages, which consolidate information about properties.</p>
<p>The hack was identified within hours.</p> </div></div>
