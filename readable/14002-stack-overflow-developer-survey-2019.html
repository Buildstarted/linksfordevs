We estimate that 21 million of these people are professional developers and university-level students. The majority of our survey respondents this year were people who said they are professional developers or who code sometimes as part of their work, or are students preparing for such a career. About 4% of respondents code as a hobby but not as a profession, and just under 2% of respondents used to be professional developers but no longer are.</p><p>See our <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#methodology">Methodology</a> section for details on how developers around the world accessed our survey.</p><div class="tab-content"><div class="tab-pane fade active in" id="developer-profile-developer-roles-all-respondents" role="tabpanel"><div class="bar-set"><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Developer, full-stack</p><p class="bar-label">51.9%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Developer, front-end</p><p class="bar-label">32.8%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Developer, desktop or enterprise applications</p><p class="bar-label">21.3%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Database administrator</p><p class="bar-label">11.7%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">System administrator</p><p class="bar-label">11.0%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Developer, embedded applications or devices</p><p class="bar-label">8.9%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Data scientist or machine learning specialist</p><p class="bar-label">7.9%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Developer, QA or test</p><p class="bar-label">7.8%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Data or business analyst</p><p class="bar-label">7.7%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Developer, game or graphics</p><p class="bar-label">5.5%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Engineer, site reliability</p><p class="bar-label">3.6%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Marketing or sales professional</p><p class="bar-label">1.2%</p></div></div><sub class="_muted _line-top">

        </sub></div></div><p>About 50% of respondents identify as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?sort=i&amp;q=full+stack+developer" target="_blank">full-stack developers</a>, and about 17% consider themselves mobile developers. The median number of developer type identifications per respondent this year is 3, and the most common pairs are combinations of back-end, front-end, and full-stack developer. Pairs that are highly correlated include database administrator and system administrator, DevOps specialist and site reliability engineer, academic researcher and scientist, and designer and front-end developer.</p><p>Survey weighting is an approach used to analyze survey data when the survey sample doesn't match the underlying population well. For example, in our survey this year, 11% of US respondents identify as women, but data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-databook/2017/home.htm" target="_blank">women's participation in the software developer workforce</a> is about twice that, more like 20%. We can use survey weighting to adjust for the mismatch between our survey sample and the population of developers. We know that there is a difference in <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#developer-profile-_-developer-role-and-gender">developer type representation by gender</a>, so let's compare the overall proportions in our raw results for the United States with weighted proportions, assuming that we undersampled gender minorities at the rate indicated by the BLS report. When we use weighting, we see small increases in the representation of developer roles that have the most representation from women, like designers, and decreases in others with low representation from women, like DevOps.</p><p>We know there are more ways in which our survey sample doesn't match the underlying population of developers than only gender (including frequency of use of Stack Overflow), and the United States is not the only country for which we expect such a mismatch. The reason we're using this specific example of weighting here is that it is one where we know we have systemic sampling issues <em>and</em> we have an estimate about the expected population proportion. We can demonstrate the effect of our survey sample on our results, both in direction and magnitude.</p><div class="tab-content"><div class="tab-pane fade active in" id="developer-profile-developer-roles-all-respondents2" role="tabpanel"><div class="bar-set"><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Less than once per year</p><p class="bar-label">28.1%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Less than once a month but more than once per year</p><p class="bar-label">23.1%</p></div><div class="bar-row"><p class="bar-label">Once a month or more often</p><p class="bar-label">12.4%</p></div></div><sub class="_muted _line-top">

Overall, over half of respondents had written code by the time they were sixteen, but experience varies widely. There is two years' or more difference in the mean first age from countries like Australia and the UK compared to India and Brazil. If we control for developer age today, we see an even more dramatic disparity between India (where developers who are older today started coding later in life) and the UK (where developers who are older today started coding earlier in life). We also see differences with gender, with women writing their first code later than men and non-binary respondents writing code earlier than men.</p><div class="bar-set"><sub class="_muted _line-top">
