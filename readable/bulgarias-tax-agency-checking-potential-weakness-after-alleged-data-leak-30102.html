Some data was older and some more recent, the report said.</p><p>Newspaper 24 Chassa said that one file had more than 1.1 million EGN numbers with monthly income figures, as well as social security and healthcare contributions.</p><p>Both reports said that the email contained a claim that a total of 110 “confidential databases” had been “compromised”, but the email contained access to only 57 of them.</p><p>The two reports quoted the email saying that more than five million Bulgarians and foreigners were affected by the alleged leak.</p><p>“Your government is mentally retarded. The state of your cybersecurity is a parody,” the two reports quoted the email as saying.</p><p><em>(Photo: jainapoorv/freeimages.com)</em></p><h3>Comments</h3><p> comments</p></div></div></div></div>
