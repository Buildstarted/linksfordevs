Subject:Re: PostgreSQL's handling of fsync() errors is unsafe and risks data loss at least on XFS
Date:2018-03-28 02:23:46
</code></pre> <p>Hi all</p> <p>Some time ago I ran into an issue where a user encountered data corruption after a storage error. PostgreSQL played a part in that corruption by allowing checkpoint what should've been a fatal error.</p> <p>TL;DR: Pg should PANIC on fsync() EIO return. Retrying fsync() is not OK at least on Linux. When fsync() returns success it means "all writes since the last fsync have hit disk" but we assume it means "all writes since the last SUCCESSFUL fsync have hit disk".</p> <p>Pg wrote some blocks, which went to OS dirty buffers for writeback. Writeback failed due to an underlying storage error. The block I/O layer and XFS marked the writeback page as failed (AS_EIO), but had no way to tell the app about the failure. When Pg called fsync() on the FD during the next checkpoint, fsync() returned EIO because of the flagged page, to tell Pg that a previous async write failed. Pg treated the checkpoint as failed and didn't advance the redo start position in the control file.</p> <p>All good so far.</p> <p>But then we retried the checkpoint, which retried the fsync(). The retry succeeded, because the prior fsync() <em>cleared the AS_EIO bad page flag</em>.</p> <p>The write never made it to disk, but we completed the checkpoint, and merrily carried on our way. Whoops, data loss.</p> <p>The clear-error-and-continue behaviour of fsync is not documented as far as I can tell. Nor is fsync() returning EIO unless you have a very new linux man-pages with the patch I wrote to add it. But from what I can see in the POSIX standard we are not given any guarantees about what happens on fsync() failure at all, so we're probably wrong to assume that retrying fsync( ) is safe.</p> <p>If the server had been using ext3 or ext4 with errors=remount-ro, the problem wouldn't have occurred because the first I/O error would've remounted the FS and stopped Pg from continuing. But XFS doesn't have that option. There may be other situations where this can occur too, involving LVM and/or multipath, but I haven't comprehensively dug out the details yet.</p> <p>It proved possible to recover the system by faking up a backup label from before the first incorrectly-successful checkpoint, forcing redo to repeat and write the lost blocks. But ... what a mess.</p> <p>I posted about the underlying fsync issue here some time ago:</p> <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/42434872/398670">https://stackoverflow.com/q/42434872/398670</a></p> <p>but haven't had a chance to follow up about the Pg specifics.</p> <p>I've been looking at the problem on and off and haven't come up with a good answer. I think we should just PANIC and let redo sort it out by repeating the failed write when it repeats work since the last checkpoint.</p> <p>The API offered by async buffered writes and fsync offers us no way to find out which page failed, so we can't just selectively redo that write. I think we do know the relfilenode associated with the fd that failed to fsync, but not much more. So the alternative seems to be some sort of potentially complex online-redo scheme where we replay WAL only the relation on which we had the fsync() error, while otherwise servicing queries normally. That's likely to be extremely error-prone and hard to test, and it's trying to solve a case where on other filesystems the whole DB would grind to a halt anyway.</p> <p>I looked into whether we can solve it with use of the AIO API instead, but the mess is even worse there - from what I can tell you can't even reliably guarantee fsync at all on all Linux kernel versions.</p> <p>We already PANIC on fsync() failure for WAL segments. We just need to do the same for data forks at least for EIO. This isn't as bad as it seems because AFAICS fsync only returns EIO in cases where we should be stopping the world anyway, and many FSes will do that for us.</p> <p>There are rather a lot of pg_fsync() callers. While we could handle this case-by-case for each one, I'm tempted to just make pg_fsync() itself intercept EIO and PANIC. Thoughts?</p> <hr> <pre><code>From:Tom Lane &lt;tgl(at)sss(dot)pgh(dot)pa(dot)us&gt;

This clearly is a design which most kernels have not really adopted for reasons outlined above (although having the FS layer recovering from hard errors transparently is open for discussion from what it seems [1]). Now, there is the issue of granularity of error reporting: userspace could benefit from a fine-grained indication of failed pages (or file ranges). Another issue is that of reporting semantics (report and clear), which is also a design choice made to avoid having higher-resolution error tracking and the corresponding memory overheads [1].</p> <p>[1] <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/718734/">https://lwn.net/Articles/718734/</a></p> <hr> <pre><code>From:Andres Freund &lt;andres(at)anarazel(dot)de&gt;

       This  system  call  is  extremely  dangerous and should not be used in portable programs.  None of these operations writes out the
       file's metadata.  Therefore, unless the application is strictly performing overwrites of already-instantiated disk  blocks,  there
       are no guarantees that the data will be available after a crash.  There is no user interface to know if a write is purely an over‐
       write.  On filesystems using copy-on-write semantics (e.g., btrfs) an overwrite of existing allocated blocks is impossible.   When
       writing  into  preallocated  space,  many filesystems also require calls into the block allocator, which this system call does not
       sync out to disk.  This system call does not flush disk write caches and thus does not provide any data integrity on systems  with
       volatile disk write caches.

Interestingly, there don't seem to be many operating systems that can report ENOSPC from fsync(), based on a quick scan through some documentation:</p> <pre><code>POSIX, AIX, HP-UX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD: no

Assuming such a model, after repeated and unrecoverable hard failures the process would have to explicitly inform the kernel to drop the dirty pages. All the process could do at that point is read back to userspace the dirty/failed pages and attempt to rewrite them at a different place (which is current possible too). Most applications would not bother though to inform the kernel and drop the permanently failed pages; and thus someone eventually would hit the case that a large amount of failed writeback pages are running his server out of memory, at which point people will complain that those semantics are completely unreasonable.</p> <blockquote> <p>we wouldn't need to PANIC if an fsync() fails; we could just re-write the page.

The application may indeed re-write a bunch of pages that have failed and proceed with fsync(). The kernel will deal with combining the writeback of all the re-written pages.

In a similar scenario where the second process is aware of the new semantics, it would naturally go ahead and clear the global error in order to proceed with its own write()+fsync(), which would essentially amount to the same problematic semantics you have now.</p> </blockquote> <p>I don't deny that it's possible that somebody could have an application which is utterly indifferent to the fact that earlier modifications to a file failed due to I/O errors, but is A-OK with that as long as later modifications can be flushed to disk, but I don't think that's a normal thing to want.</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Also, this really does make it impossible to write reliable programs. Imagine that, while the server is running, somebody runs a program which opens a file in the data directory, calls fsync() on it, and closes it. If the fsync() fails, postgres is now borked and has no way of being aware of the problem. If we knew, we could PANIC, but we'll never find out, because the unrelated process ate the error. This is exactly the sort of ill-considered behavior that makes fcntl() locking nearly useless.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fully agree, and the errseq_t fixes have dealt exactly with the issue of making sure that the error is reported to all file descriptors that <em>happen to be open at the time of error</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, in PostgreSQL, we have a background process called the checkpointer which is the process that normally does all of the fsync() calls but only a subset of the write() calls. The checkpointer does not, however, necessarily have every file open all the time, so these fixes aren't sufficient to make sure that the checkpointer ever sees an fsync() failure. What you have (or someone has) basically done here is made an undocumented assumption about which file descriptors might care about a particular error, but it just so happens that PostgreSQL has never conformed to that assumption. You can keep on saying the problem is with our assumptions, but it doesn't seem like a very good guess to me to suppose that we're the only program that has ever made them. The documentation for fsync() gives zero indication that it's edge-triggered, and so complaining that people wouldn't like it if it became level-triggered seems like an ex post facto justification for a poorly-chosen behavior: they probably think (as we did prior to a week ago) that it already is.</p> <blockquote> <p>Not sure I understand this case. The application may indeed re-write a bunch of pages that have failed and proceed with fsync(). The kernel will deal with combining the writeback of all the re-written pages. But further the necessity of combining for performance really depends on the exact storage medium. At the point you start caring about write-combining, the kernel community will naturally redirect you to use DIRECT_IO.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, the way PostgreSQL works today, we typically run with say 8GB of shared_buffers even if the system memory is, say, 200GB. As pages are evicted from our relatively small cache to the operating system, we track which files need to be fsync()'d at checkpoint time, but we don't hold onto the blocks. Until checkpoint time, the operating system is left to decide whether it's better to keep caching the dirty blocks (thus leaving less memory for other things, but possibly allowing write-combining if the blocks are written again) or whether it should clean them to make room for other things. This means that only a small portion of the operating system memory is directly managed by PostgreSQL, while allowing the effective size of our cache to balloon to some very large number if the system isn't under heavy memory pressure.</p> <p>Now, I hear the DIRECT_IO thing and I assume we're eventually going to have to go that way: Linux kernel developers seem to think that "real men use O_DIRECT" and so if other forms of I/O don't provide useful guarantees, well that's our fault for not using O_DIRECT. That's a political reason, not a technical reason, but it's a reason all the same.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that is going to add a huge amount of complexity, because if we ran with shared_buffers set to a large percentage of system memory, we couldn't allocate large chunks of memory for sorts and hash tables from the operating system any more. We'd have to allocate it from our own shared_buffers because that's basically all the memory there is and using substantially more might run the system out entirely. So it's a huge, huge architectural change. And even once it's done it is in some ways inferior to what we are doing today -- true, it gives us superior control over writeback timing, but it also makes PostgreSQL play less nicely with other things running on the same machine, because now PostgreSQL has a dedicated chunk of whatever size it has, rather than using some portion of the OS buffer cache that can grow and shrink according to memory needs both of other parts of PostgreSQL and other applications on the system.</p> <blockquote> <p>I suppose that if the check-and-clear semantics are problematic for Pg, one could suggest a kernel patch that opts-in to a level-triggered reporting of fsync() on a per-descriptor basis, which seems to be non-intrusive and probably sufficient to cover your expected use-case.</p> </blockquote> <p>That would certainly be better than nothing.</p> <hr> <pre><code>From:Thomas Munro &lt;thomas(dot)munro(at)enterprisedb(dot)com&gt;

Obviously not, but where does it stop? Tell the next program that does an fsync() and forget? How could it associate a dirty buffer on a file with no open FDs with any particular program at all?

Report the fsync() error to the first process that does an fsync() since the writeback error if one has occurred, then forget about it. Ideally I'd have liked it to mark all FDs pointing to the file with a flag to report EIO on next fsync too, but it turns out that won't even help us due to our opening and closing behaviour, so we're going to have to take responsibility for handling and communicating that ourselves, preventing checkpoint completion if any backend gets an fsync error.

The same is true for /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches. I have not tested these yet.</p> <p>There's some level of agreement that we should PANIC on fsync() errors, at least on Linux, but likely everywhere. But we also now know it's insufficient to be fully protective.</p> <p>I previously though that errors=remount-ro was a sufficient safeguard. It isn't.

(In my test tools that's: make FSTYPE=ext4 MKFSOPTS="" MOUNTOPTS="errors=remount-ro, data_err=abort,data=journal" as of the current version d7fe802ec). AFAICS that's because data_error=abort only affects data=ordered, not data=journal. If you use data=ordered, you at least get retries of the same write failing. This post <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/10/10/80">https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/10/10/80</a> added the option and has some explanation, but doesn't explain why it doesn't affect data=journal.</p> <p>zfs is probably not affected by the issues, per Thomas Munro. I haven't run my test scripts on it yet because my kernel doesn't have zfs support and I'm prioritising the multi-process / open-and-close issues.</p> <p>So far none of the FSes and options I've tried exhibit the behavour I actually want, which is to make the fs readonly or inaccessible on I/O error.</p> <p>ENOSPC doesn't seem to be a concern during normal operation of major file systems (ext3, ext4, btrfs, xfs) because they reserve space before returning from write(). But if a buffered write does manage to fail due to ENOSPC we'll definitely see the same problems. This makes ENOSPC on NFS a potentially data corrupting condition since NFS doesn't preallocate space before returning from write().</p> <p>I think what we really need is a block-layer fix, where an I/O error flips the block device into read-only mode, as if blockdev --setro had been used. Though I'd settle for a kernel panic, frankly.

What else can it do? Nobody has the file open. It'd have to mark the file its self as bad somehow.

To test that I set dirty_writeback_centisecs and dirty_expire_centisecs to 1 and added a usleep(3*100*1000) between close() and open(). (It's still plenty slow). So sync() is a convenient way to simulate something other than our own fsync() writing out the dirty buffer.</p> <p>If I omit the sync() then we get the error reported by fsync() once when we re open() the file and fsync() it, because the buffers weren't written out yet, so the error wasn't generated until we re-open()ed the file. But I doubt that'll happen much in practice because dirty writeback will get to it first so the error will be seen and discarded before we reopen the file in the checkpointer.</p> <p>In other words, it looks like <em>even with a new kernel with the error reporting bug fixes</em>, if I understand how the backends and checkpointer interact when it comes to file descriptors, we're unlikely to notice I/O errors and fail a checkpoint. We may notice I/O errors if a backend does its own eager writeback for large I/O operations, or if the checkpointer fsync()s a file before the kernel's dirty writeback gets around to trying to flush the pages that will fail.</p> <p>I haven't tested anything with multiple processes / multiple FDs yet, where we keep one fd open while writing on another.</p> <p>But at this point I don't see any way to make Pg reliably detect I/O errors and fail a checkpoint then redo and retry. To even fix this by PANICing like I proposed originally, we need to know we have to PANIC.</p> <p>AFAICS it's completely unsafe to write(), close(), open() and fsync() and expect that the fsync() makes any promises about the write(). Which if I read Pg's low level storage code right, makes it completely unable to reliably detect I/O errors.</p> <p>When put it that way, it sounds fair enough too. How long is the kernel meant to remember that there was a write error on the file triggered by a write initiated by some seemingly unrelated process, some unbounded time ago, on a since-closed file?</p> <p>But it seems to put Pg on the fast track to O_DIRECT.</p> <hr> <pre><code>From:Bruce Momjian &lt;bruce(at)momjian(dot)us&gt;

(I'm on 4.14 here).</p> <p>I can try to reproduce it with postgres too, but it not only requires closing and reopening the FDs, it also requires forcing writeback before opening the fd. To make it occur in a practical timeframe I have to make my kernel writeback settings insanely aggressive and/or call sync() before re-open()ing.

Whether the kernel discards writes or not would not really help (see above).

In the short term, the best advice to installations is to monitor their kernel logs for errors (which very few do right now), and make sure they have a backup strategy which can encompass restoring from an error like this.

So we can get ENOSPC lazily when the buffer writeback fails due to a full backing file system. This then travels the same paths as EIO: we fsync(), ERROR, retry, appear to succeed, and carry on with life losing the data.

Due to use of thin provisioning, Linux <em>thought</em> there was plenty of space on the volume; LVM thought it had plenty of physical extents free and unallocated, XFS thought there was tons of free space, etc. The space exhaustion manifested as I/O errors on flushes of writeback buffers.</p> <p>The logs were like this:</p> <pre><code>kernel: sd 2:0:0:1: [sdd] Unhandled sense code

</code></pre> <p>The immediate cause was that Linux's multipath driver didn't seem to recognise the sense code as retryable, so it gave up and reported it to the next layer up (LVM). LVM and XFS both seem to think that the lower layer is responsible for retries, so they toss the write away, and tell any interested writers if they feel like it, per discussion upthread.</p> <p>In this case Pg did get the news and reported fsync() errors on checkpoints, but it only reported an error once per relfilenode. Once it ran out of failed relfilenodes to cause the checkpoint to ERROR, it "completed" a "successful" checkpoint and kept on running until the resulting corruption started to manifest its self and it segfaulted some time later. As we've now learned, there's no guarantee we'd even get the news about the I/O errors at all.</p> <p>WAL was on a separate volume that didn't run out of room immediately, so we didn't PANIC on WAL write failure and prevent the issue.</p> <p>In this case if Pg had PANIC'd (and been able to guarantee to get the news of write failures reliably), there'd have been no corruption and no data loss despite the underlying storage issue.</p> <p>If, prior to seeing this, you'd asked me "will my PostgreSQL database be corrupted if my thin-provisioned volume runs out of space" I'd have said "Surely not. PostgreSQL won't be corrupted by running out of disk space, it orders writes carefully and forces flushes so that it will recover gracefully from write failures."</p> <p>Except not. I was very surprised.</p> <p>BTW, it also turns out that the <em>default</em> for multipath is to give up on errors anyway; see the queue_if_no_path option and no_path_retries options. (Hint: run PostgreSQL with no_path_retries=queue). That's a sane default if you use O_DIRECT|O_SYNC, and otherwise pretty much a data-eating setup.</p> <p>I regularly see rather a lot of multipath systems, iSCSI systems, SAN backed systems, etc. I think we need to be pretty clear that we expect them to retry indefinitely, and if they report an I/O error we cannot reliably handle it. We need to patch Pg to PANIC on any fsync() failure and document that Pg won't notice some storage failure modes that might otherwise be considered nonfatal or transient, so very specific storage configuration and testing is required. (Not that anyone will do it). Also warn against running on NFS even with "hard,sync,nointr".</p> <p>It'd be interesting to have a tool that tested error handling, allowing people to do iSCSI plug-pull tests, that sort of thing. But as far as I can tell nobody ever tests their storage stack anyway, so I don't plan on writing something that'll never get used.</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>I think we need to think about a more robust path in future.

The contract between the block layer and the filesystem layer is assumed to be that of, when an EIO is propagated up to the fs, then you may assume that all possibilities for recovering have been exhausted in lower layers of the stack. Mind you, I am not claiming that this contract is either documented or necessarily respected (in fact there have been studies on the error propagation and handling of the block layer, see [1]). Let us assume that this is the design contract though (which appears to be the case across a number of open-source kernels), and if not - it's a bug. In this case, indeed the specific write()s will never be able to succeed in the future, at least not as long as the BIOs are allocated to the specific failing LBAs.</p> <blockquote> <p>But secondly doesn't such an interface already exist? When the device is dropped any dirty pages already get dropped with it. What's the point in dropping them but keeping the failing device?</p> </blockquote> <p>I think there are degrees of failure. There are certainly cases where one may encounter localized unrecoverable medium errors (specific to certain LBAs) that are non-maskable from the block layer and below. That does not mean that the device is dropped at all, so it does make sense to continue all other operations to all other regions of the device that are functional. In cases of total device failure, then the filesystem will prevent you from proceeding anyway.</p> <blockquote> <p>But just to underline the point.

This implies though that apart from the kernel having to keep around the dirtied-but-unrecoverable pages for an unbounded time, that there's further an interface for obtaining the exact failed pages so that you can read them back. This in turn means that there needs to be an association between the fsync() caller and the specific dirtied pages that the caller intents to drain (for which we'd need an fsync_range(), among other things). BTW, currently the failed writebacks are not dropped from memory, but rather marked clean.

It has to control how much memory is allowed to be full of dirty buffers in the first place to ensure that the system won't get memory starved if it can't clean them fast enough. That isn't even about persistent hardware errors. Even when the hardware is working perfectly it can only flush buffers so fast. The whole point of the kernel is to abstract away shared resources. It's not like user space has any better view of the situation here. If Postgres implemented all this in DIRECT_IO it would have exactly the same problem only with less visibility into what the rest of the system is doing. If every application implemented its own buffer cache we would be back in the same boat only with a fragmented memory allocation.</p> <blockquote> <p>This has the potential to leave other applications running in the same system with very little memory, in cases where for example original application crashes and never clears the error.</p> </blockquote> <p>I still think we're speaking two different languages. There's no application anywhere that's going to "clear the error". The application has done the writes and if it's calling fsync it wants to wait until the filesystem can arrange for the write to be persisted. If the application could manage without the persistence then it wouldn't have called fsync.</p> <p>The only way to "clear out" the error would be by having the writes succeed. There's no reason to think that wouldn't be possible sometime. The filesystem could remap blocks or an administrator could replace degraded raid device components. The only thing Postgres could do to recover would be create a new file and move the data (reading from the dirty buffer in memory!) to a new file anyways so we would "clear the error" by just no longer calling fsync on the old file.</p> <p>We always read fsync as a simple write barrier. That's what the documentation promised and it's what Postgres always expected. It sounds like the kernel implementors looked at it as some kind of communication channel to communicate status report for specific writes back to user-space. That's a much more complex problem and would have entirely different interface. I think this is why we're having so much difficulty communicating.</p> <blockquote> <p>It is reasonable, but even FreeBSD has a big fat comment right there (since 2017), mentioning that there can be no recovery from EIO at the block layer and this needs to be done differently.

Say somebody does something along the lines of:</p> <pre><code>ps uxww | grep postgres | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
</code></pre> <p>...and then restarts postgres. Craig's proposal wouldn't cover this case, because there was no opportunity to run fsync() after the first crash, and there's now no way to go back and fsync() any stuff we didn't fsync() before, because the kernel may have already thrown away the error state, or may lie to us and tell us everything is fine (because our new fd wasn't opened early enough). I can't find the original discussion that led to that commit right now, so I'm not exactly sure what scenarios we were thinking about. But I think it would at least be a problem if full_page_writes=off or if you had previously started the server with fsync=off and now wish to switch to fsync=on after completing a bulk load or similar. Recovery can read a page, see that it looks OK, and continue, and then a later fsync() failure can revert that page to an earlier state and now your database is corrupted -- and there's absolute no way to detect this because write() gives you the new page contents later, fsync() doesn't feel obliged to tell you about the error because your fd wasn't opened early enough, and eventually the write can be discarded and you'll revert back to the old page version with no errors ever being reported anywhere.</p> <p>Another consequence of this behavior that initdb -S is never reliable, so pg_rewind's use of it doesn't actually fix the problem it was intended to solve. It also means that initdb itself isn't crash-safe, since the data file changes are made by the backend but initdb itself is doing the fsyncs, and initdb has no way of knowing what files the backend is going to create and therefore can't -- even theoretically -- open them first.</p> <p>What's being presented to us as the API contract that we should expect from buffered I/O is that if you open a file and read() from it, call fsync(), and get no error, the kernel may nevertheless decide that some previous write that it never managed to flush can't be flushed, and then revert the page to the contents it had at some point in the past. That's mostly or less equivalent to letting a malicious adversary randomly overwrite database pages plausible-looking but incorrect contents without notice and hoping you can still build a reliable system. You can avoid the problem if you can always open an fd for every file you want to modify before it's written and hold on to it until after it's fsync'd, but that's pretty hard to guarantee in the face of kill -9.</p> <p>I think the simplest technological solution to this problem is to rewrite the entire backend and all supporting processes to use O_DIRECT everywhere. To maintain adequate performance, we'll have to write a complete I/O scheduling system inside PostgreSQL. Also, since we'll now have to make shared_buffers much larger -- since we'll no longer be benefiting from the OS cache -- we'll need to replace the use of malloc() with an allocator that pulls from shared_buffers.

Not sure how helpful it would be in the long run since this tends to be highly application-specific, and for something with a large data footprint one would end up tuning this accordingly in a system-wide manner. This has the potential to leave other applications running in the same system with very little memory, in cases where for example original application crashes and never clears the error.

Possibly something that says "drop dirty pages for these files" after the application gets killed or something.

No idea how an application running on top of either FreeBSD or Illumos would actually recover from this error (and clear it out), other than remounting the fs in order to force dropping of relevant pages. It does provide though indeed a persistent error indication that would allow Pg to simply reliably panic. But again this does not necessarily play well with other applications that may be using the filesystem reliably at the same time, and are now faced with EIO while their own writes succeed to be persisted.</p> </blockquote> <p>In my experience when you have a persistent I/O error on a device, it likely affects all applications using that device. So unmounting the fs to clear the dirty pages seems like an acceptable solution to me.</p> <p>I don't see what else the application should do? In a way I'm suggesting applications don't really want to be responsible for recovering (cleanup or dirty pages etc.). We're more than happy to hand that over to kernel, e.g. because each kernel will do that differently. What we however do want is reliable information about fsync outcome, which we need to properly manage WAL, checkpoints etc.</p> <blockquote> <p>Ideally, you'd want a (potentially persistent) indication of error localized to a file region (mapping the corresponding failed writeback pages). NetBSD is already implementing fsync_ranges(), which could be a step in the right direction.</p> <blockquote> <p>One has to wonder how many applications actually use this correctly, considering PostgreSQL cares about data durability/consistency so much and yet we've been misunderstanding how it works for 20+ years.</p> </blockquote> <p>I would expect it would be very few, potentially those that have a very simple process model (e.g. embedded DBs that can abort a txn on fsync() EIO). I think that durability is a rather complex cross-layer issue which has been grossly misunderstood similarly in the past (e.g. see [1]). It seems that both the OS and DB communities greatly benefit from a periodic reality check, and I see this as an opportunity for strengthening the IO stack in an end-to-end manner.</p> </blockquote> <p>Right. What I was getting to is that perhaps the current fsync() behavior is not very practical for building actual applications.</p> <blockquote> <p>Best regards, Anthony</p> <p>[1] <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-pillai.pdf">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-pillai.pdf</a></p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks.

But a user might see it differently. If the data being loaded into the master and getting replicated to the standby "causes" both to get corrupt, then it seems like corruption spreading. I put "causes" in quotes because there is some argument to be made about "correlation does not prove cause" and so forth, but it still feels like causation from an arms length perspective. If there is a pattern of standby servers tending to fail more often right around the time that the master fails, you'll have a hard time comforting users, "hey, it's not technically causation." If loading data into the master causes the master to hit ENOSPC, and replicating that data to the standby causes the standby to hit ENOSPC, and if the bug abound ENOSPC has not been fixed, then this looks like corruption spreading.</p> <p>I'm certainly planning on taking a hard look at the disk allocation on my standby servers right soon now.</p> <hr> <pre><code>From:Thomas Munro &lt;thomas(dot)munro(at)enterprisedb(dot)com&gt;

If you can't find reliably find out whether the contents of the file on disk are the same as the contents that the kernel is giving you when you call read(), then you are going to have a heck of a time building a reliable system.

The only argument for the current Linux behavior that has been so far advanced on this thread, at least as far as I can see, is that if it kept retrying the buffers forever, it would be pointless and might run the machine out of memory, so we might as well discard them. But previous comments have already illustrated that the kernel is not really up against a wall there -- it could put individual inodes into a permanent failure state when it discards their dirty data, as you suggested, or it could do what others have suggested, and what I think is better, which is to put the whole filesystem into a permanent failure state that can be cleared by remounting the FS. That could be done on an as-needed basis -- if the number of dirty buffers you're holding onto for some filesystem becomes too large, put the filesystem into infinite-fail mode and discard them all. That behavior would be pretty easy for administrators to understand and would resolve the entire problem here provided that no PostgreSQL processes survived the eventual remount.</p> <p>I also don't really know what we mean by an "unresolvable" error. If the drive is beyond all hope, then it doesn't really make sense to talk about whether the database stored on it is corrupt. In general we can't be sure that we'll even get an error - e.g. the system could be idle and the drive could be on fire. Maybe this is the case you meant by "it'd be nice if we could report it reliably". But at least in my experience, that's typically not what's going on. You get some I/O errors and so you remount the filesystem, or reboot, or rebuild the array, or ... something. And then the errors go away and, at that point, you want to run recovery and continue using your database. In this scenario, it matters <em>quite a bit</em> what the error reporting was like during the period when failures were occurring. In particular, if the database was allowed to think that it had successfully checkpointed when it didn't, you're going to start recovery from the wrong place.</p> <p>I'm going to shut up now because I'm telling you things that you obviously already know, but this doesn't sound like a "near irresolvable corner case". When the storage goes bonkers, either PostgreSQL and the kernel can interact in such a way that a checkpoint can succeed without all of the relevant data getting persisted, or they don't. It sounds like right now they do, and I'm not really clear that we have a reasonable idea how to fix that. It does not sound like a PANIC is sufficient.</p> <hr> <pre><code>From:Robert Haas &lt;robertmhaas(at)gmail(dot)com&gt;

It warns after 100 failures and fails an assertion after 1000 failures. It is hard to understand why they would have written the code this way unless they expect errors reported by fsync() to continue being reported until the underlying condition is corrected. But, it looks like they wouldn't have the problem that we do with trying to reopen files to fsync() them later -- I spot checked a few places where this code is invoked and in all of those it looks like the file is already expected to be open.</p> <hr> <pre><code>From:Anthony Iliopoulos &lt;ailiop(at)altatus(dot)com&gt;

Neither layer here is going to be perfect. They can only promise that all possibilities that have actually been implemented have been exhausted. And even among those only to the degree they can be done automatically within the engineering tradeoffs and constraints. There will always be cases like thin provisioned devices that an operator can expand, or degraded raid arrays that can be repaired after a long operation and so on. A network device can't be sure whether a remote server may eventually come back or not and have to be reconfigured by a human or system automation tool to point to the new server or new network configuration.</p> <blockquote> <p>Right. This implies though that apart from the kernel having to keep around the dirtied-but-unrecoverable pages for an unbounded time, that there's further an interface for obtaining the exact failed pages so that you can read them back.</p> </blockquote> <p>No, the interface we have is fsync which gives us that information with the granularity of a single file. The database could in theory recognize that fsync is not completing on a file and read that file back and write it to a new file. More likely we would implement a feature Oracle has of writing key files to multiple devices. But currently in practice that's not what would happen, what would happen would be a human would recognize that the database has stopped being able to commit and there are hardware errors in the log and would stop the database, take a backup, and restore onto a new working device. The current interface is that there's one error and then Postgres would pretty much have to say, "sorry, your database is corrupt and the data is gone, restore from your backups". Which is pretty dismal.</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a clear responsibility of the application to keep its buffers around until a successful fsync(). The kernels do report the error (albeit with all the complexities of dealing with the interface), at which point the application may not assume that the write()s where ever even buffered in the kernel page cache in the first place.</p> </blockquote> <p>Postgres cannot just store the entire database in RAM. It writes things to the filesystem all the time. It calls fsync only when it needs a write barrier to ensure consistency. That's only frequent on the transaction log to ensure it's flushed before data modifications and then periodically to checkpoint the data files. The amount of data written between checkpoints can be arbitrarily large and Postgres has no idea how much memory is available as filesystem buffers or how much i/o bandwidth is available or other memory pressure there is. What you're suggesting is that the application should have to babysit the filesystem buffer cache and reimplement all of it in user-space because the filesystem is free to throw away any data any time it chooses?</p> <p>The current interface to throw away filesystem buffer cache is unmount. It sounds like the kernel would like a more granular way to discard just part of a device which makes a lot of sense in the age of large network block devices. But I don't think just saying that the filesystem buffer cache is now something every application needs to re-implement in user-space really helps with that, they're going to have the same problems to solve.</p> <hr> <pre><code>From:Greg Stark &lt;stark(at)mit(dot)edu&gt;

</code></pre> <p>-hackers,</p> <p>I reached out to the Linux ext4 devs, here is tytso(at)mit(dot)edu response:</p> <p>""" Hi Joshua,</p> <p>This isn't actually an ext4 issue, but a long-standing VFS/MM issue.</p> <p>There are going to be multiple opinions about what the right thing to do. I'll try to give as unbiased a description as possible, but certainly some of this is going to be filtered by my own biases no matter how careful I can be.</p> <p>First of all, what storage devices will do when they hit an exception condition is quite non-deterministic. For example, the vast majority of SSD's are not power fail certified. What this means is that if they suffer a power drop while they are doing a GC, it is quite possible for data written six months ago to be lost as a result. The LBA could potentialy be far, far away from any LBA's that were recently written, and there could have been multiple CACHE FLUSH operations in the since the LBA in question was last written six months ago. No matter; for a consumer-grade SSD, it's possible for that LBA to be trashed after an unexpected power drop.</p> <p>Which is why after a while, one can get quite paranoid and assume that the only way you can guarantee data robustness is to store multiple copies and/or use erasure encoding, with some of the copies or shards written to geographically diverse data centers.</p> <p>Secondly, I think it's fair to say that the vast majority of the companies who require data robustness, and are either willing to pay $$$ to an enterprise distro company like Red Hat, or command a large enough paying customer base that they can afford to dictate terms to an enterprise distro, or hire a consultant such as Christoph, or have their own staffed Linux kernel teams, have tended to use O_DIRECT. So for better or for worse, there has not been as much investment in buffered I/O and data robustness in the face of exception handling of storage devices.</p> <p>Next, the reason why fsync() has the behaviour that it does is one ofhe the most common cases of I/O storage errors in buffered use cases, certainly as seen by the community distros, is the user who pulls out USB stick while it is in use. In that case, if there are dirtied pages in the page cache, the question is what can you do? Sooner or later the writes will time out, and if you leave the pages dirty, then it effectively becomes a permanent memory leak. You can't unmount the file system --- that requires writing out all of the pages such that the dirty bit is turned off. And if you don't clear the dirty bit on an I/O error, then they can never be cleaned. You can't even re-insert the USB stick; the re-inserted USB stick will get a new block device. Worse, when the USB stick was pulled, it will have suffered a power drop, and see above about what could happen after a power drop for non-power fail certified flash devices --- it goes double for the cheap sh*t USB sticks found in the checkout aisle of Micro Center.</p> <p>So this is the explanation for why Linux handles I/O errors by clearing the dirty bit after reporting the error up to user space. And why there is not eagerness to solve the problem simply by "don't clear the dirty bit". For every one Postgres installation that might have a better recover after an I/O error, there's probably a thousand clueless Fedora and Ubuntu users who will have a much worse user experience after a USB stick pull happens.</p> <p>I can think of things that could be done --- for example, it could be switchable on a per-block device basis (or maybe a per-mount basis) whether or not the dirty bit gets cleared after the error is reported to userspace. And perhaps there could be a new unmount flag that causes all dirty pages to be wiped out, which could be used to recover after a permanent loss of the block device. But the question is who is going to invest the time to make these changes? If there is a company who is willing to pay to comission this work, it's almost certainly soluble. Or if a company which has a kernel on staff is willing to direct an engineer to work on it, it certainly could be solved. But again, of the companies who have client code where we care about robustness and proper handling of failed disk drives, and which have a kernel team on staff, pretty much all of the ones I can think of (e.g., Oracle, Google, etc.) use O_DIRECT and they don't try to make buffered writes and error reporting via fsync(2) work well.</p> <p>In general these companies want low-level control over buffer cache eviction algorithms, which drives them towards the design decision of effectively implementing the page cache in userspace, and using O_DIRECT reads/writes.</p> <p>If you are aware of a company who is willing to pay to have a new kernel feature implemented to meet your needs, we might be able to refer you to a company or a consultant who might be able to do that work. Let me know off-line if that's the case...</p> <pre><code>- Ted

So the FS is usually unaware it's on a thin-provisioned volume. Usually the whole kernel is unaware, because the thin provisioning is done on the SAN end or by a hypervisor. But the same sort of thing may be done via LVM - see lvmthin. For example, you may make 100 different 1TB ext4 FSes, each on 1TB iSCSI volumes backed by SAN with a total of 50TB of concrete physical capacity. The SAN is doing block mapping and only allocating storage chunks to a given volume when the FS has written blocks to every previous free block in the previous storage chunk. It may also do things like block de-duplication, compression of storage chunks that aren't written to for a while, etc.</p> <p>The idea is that when the SAN's actual physically allocate storage gets to 40TB it starts telling you to go buy another rack of storage so you don't run out. You don't have to resize volumes, resize file systems, etc. All the storage space admin is centralized on the SAN and storage team, and your sysadmins, DBAs and app devs are none the wiser. You buy storage when you need it, not when the DBA demands they need a 200% free space margin just in case.

You can malloc() as much memory as you like and everything's fine until you try to actually use it. Then you go to dirty a page, no free pages are available, and <em>boom</em>.</p> <p>The thing is, the SAN (or LVM) doesn't have any idea about the FS's internal in-memory free space counter and its space reservations. Nor does it understand any FS metadata. All it cares about is "has this LBA ever been written to by the FS?". If so, it must make sure backing storage for it exists.

It seems like you can't count on that in any way though, because it's the server that decides when to delegate and how much space to promise is preallocated, not the client. So in userspace you always need to be able to handle errors including ENOSPC returned by close(), and if you ignore that and you're using an operating system that immediately incinerates all evidence after telling you that (so that later fsync() doesn't fail), you're in trouble.</p> <p>Some relevant code:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/5445b1fbd123420bffed5e629a420aa2a16bf849">https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/5445b1fbd123420bffed5e629a420aa2a16bf849</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/sys/fs/nfsclient/nfs_clvnops.c#L618">https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/sys/fs/nfsclient/nfs_clvnops.c#L618</a></li> </ul> <p>It looks like the bleeding edge of the NFS spec includes a new ALLOCATE operation that should be able to support posix_fallocate() (if we were to start using that for extending files):</p> <p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7862#page-64">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7862#page-64</a></p> <p>I'm not sure how reliable [posix_]fallocate is on NFS in general though, and it seems that there are fall-back implementations of posix_fallocate() that write zeros (or even just feign success?) which probably won't do anything useful here if not also flushed (that fallback strategy might only work on eager reservation filesystems that don't have direct fallocate support?) so there are several layers (libc, kernel, nfs client, nfs server) that'd need to be aligned for that to work, and it's not clear how a humble userspace program is supposed to know if they are.</p> <p>I guess if you could find a way to amortise the cost of extending (like Oracle et al do by extending big container datafiles 10MB at a time or whatever), then simply writing zeros and flushing when doing that might work out OK, so you wouldn't need such a thing?

</code></pre> <p>Hi Joshua,</p> <p>This isn't actually an ext4 issue, but a long-standing VFS/MM issue.</p> <p>There are going to be multiple opinions about what the right thing to do. I'll try to give as unbiased a description as possible, but certainly some of this is going to be filtered by my own biases no matter how careful I can be.</p> <p>First of all, what storage devices will do when they hit an exception condition is quite non-deterministic. For example, the vast majority of SSD's are not power fail certified. What this means is that if they suffer a power drop while they are doing a GC, it is quite possible for data written six months ago to be lost as a result. The LBA could potentialy be far, far away from any LBA's that were recently written, and there could have been multiple CACHE FLUSH operations in the since the LBA in question was last written six months ago. No matter; for a consumer-grade SSD, it's possible for that LBA to be trashed after an unexpected power drop.</p> <p>Which is why after a while, one can get quite paranoid and assume that the only way you can guarantee data robustness is to store multiple copies and/or use erasure encoding, with some of the copies or shards written to geographically diverse data centers.</p> <p>Secondly, I think it's fair to say that the vast majority of the companies who require data robustness, and are either willing to pay $$$ to an enterprise distro company like Red Hat, or command a large enough paying customer base that they can afford to dictate terms to an enterprise distro, or hire a consultant such as Christoph, or have their own staffed Linux kernel teams, have tended to use O_DIRECT. So for better or for worse, there has not been as much investment in buffered I/O and data robustness in the face of exception handling of storage devices.</p> <p>Next, the reason why fsync() has the behaviour that it does is one ofhe the most common cases of I/O storage errors in buffered use cases, certainly as seen by the community distros, is the user who pulls out USB stick while it is in use. In that case, if there are dirtied pages in the page cache, the question is what can you do? Sooner or later the writes will time out, and if you leave the pages dirty, then it effectively becomes a permanent memory leak. You can't unmount the file system --- that requires writing out all of the pages such that the dirty bit is turned off. And if you don't clear the dirty bit on an I/O error, then they can never be cleaned. You can't even re-insert the USB stick; the re-inserted USB stick will get a new block device. Worse, when the USB stick was pulled, it will have suffered a power drop, and see above about what could happen after a power drop for non-power fail certified flash devices --- it goes double for the cheap sh*t USB sticks found in the checkout aisle of Micro Center.</p> <p>So this is the explanation for why Linux handles I/O errors by clearing the dirty bit after reporting the error up to user space. And why there is not eagerness to solve the problem simply by "don't clear the dirty bit". For every one Postgres installation that might have a better recover after an I/O error, there's probably a thousand clueless Fedora and Ubuntu users who will have a much worse user experience after a USB stick pull happens.</p> <p>I can think of things that could be done --- for example, it could be switchable on a per-block device basis (or maybe a per-mount basis) whether or not the dirty bit gets cleared after the error is reported to userspace. And perhaps there could be a new unmount flag that causes all dirty pages to be wiped out, which could be used to recover after a permanent loss of the block device. But the question is who is going to invest the time to make these changes? If there is a company who is willing to pay to comission this work, it's almost certainly soluble. Or if a company which has a kernel on staff is willing to direct an engineer to work on it, it certainly could be solved. But again, of the companies who have client code where we care about robustness and proper handling of failed disk drives, and which have a kernel team on staff, pretty much all of the ones I can think of (e.g., Oracle, Google, etc.) use O_DIRECT and they don't try to make buffered writes and error reporting via fsync(2) work well.</p> <p>In general these companies want low-level control over buffer cache eviction algorithms, which drives them towards the design decision of effectively implementing the page cache in userspace, and using O_DIRECT reads/writes.</p> <p>If you are aware of a company who is willing to pay to have a new kernel feature implemented to meet your needs, we might be able to refer you to a company or a consultant who might be able to do that work. Let me know off-line if that's the case...</p> <hr> <pre><code>From:   Andreas Dilger &lt;adilger@...ger.ca&gt;

I've argued for the opposite behaviour at times, and some subsystems already do limited retries before finally giving up on a failed write, though there are also times when retrying at lower levels is pointless if a higher level of code can handle the failure (e.g. mirrored block devices, filesystem data mirroring, userspace data mirroring, or cross-node replication).</p> <p>The confusion is whether fsync() is a "level" state (return error forever if there were pages that could not be written), or an "edge" state (return error only for any write failures since the previous fsync() call).</p> <p>I think Anthony Iliopoulos was pretty clear in his multiple descriptions in that thread of why the current behaviour is needed (OOM of the whole system if dirty pages are kept around forever), but many others were stuck on "I can't believe this is happening???

It seems ironic that "keep dirty pages in userspace until fsync() returns success" is totally unacceptable, but "keep dirty pages in the kernel" is fine. My (limited) understanding of databases was that they preferred to cache everything in userspace and use O_DIRECT to write to disk (which returns an error immediately if the write fails and does not double buffer data).</p> <hr> <p>From: Martin Steigerwald <a href="mailto:martin@...htvoll.de">martin@...htvoll.de</a> Date: Tue, 10 Apr 2018 21:47:21 +0200</p> <p>Hi Theodore, Darrick, Joshua.</p> <p>CC´d fsdevel as it does not appear to be Ext4 specific to me (and to you as well, Theodore).</p> <p>Theodore Y.

I am aware of one operating system that from a user point of view handles this in almost the right way IMHO: AmigaOS.</p> </blockquote> <p>When you removed a floppy disk from the drive while the OS was writing to it it showed a "You MUST insert volume somename into drive somedrive:" and if you did, it just continued writing. (The part that did not work well was that with the original filesystem if you did not insert it back, the whole disk was corrupted, usually to the point beyond repair, so the "MUST" was no joke.)</p> <p>In my opinion from a user´s point of view this is the only sane way to handle the premature removal of removable media. I have read of a GSoC project to implement something like this for NetBSD but I did not check on the outcome of it. But in MS-DOS I think there has been something similar, however MS-DOS is not an multitasking operating system as AmigaOS is.</p> <p>Implementing something like this for Linux would be quite a feat, I think, cause in addition to the implementation in the kernel, the desktop environment or whatever other userspace you use would need to handle it as well, so you´d have to adapt udev / udisks / probably Systemd. And probably this behavior needs to be restricted to anything that is really removable and even then in order to prevent memory exhaustion in case processes continue to write to an removed and not yet re-inserted USB harddisk the kernel would need to halt I/O processes which dirty I/O to this device. (I believe this is what AmigaOS did. It just blocked all subsequent I/O to the device still it was re-inserted.

At least in postgres' case we can deal with the fact that an fsync retry isn't going to fix the problem by reentering crash recovery or just shutting down - therefore we don't need to keep all the dirty buffers around. A per-inode or per-superblock bit that causes further fsyncs to fail would be entirely sufficent for that.</p> <p>While there's some differing opinions on the referenced postgres thread, the fundamental problem isn't so much that a retry won't fix the problem, it's that we might NEVER see the failure. If writeback happens in the background, encounters an error, undirties the buffer, we will happily carry on because we've never seen that. That's when we're majorly screwed.</p> <p>Both in postgres, <em>and</em> a lot of other applications, it's not at all guaranteed to consistently have one FD open for every file writtten. Therefore even the more recent per-fd errseq logic doesn't guarantee that the failure will ever be seen by an application diligently fsync()ing.</p> <p>You'd not even need to have per inode information or such in the case that the block device goes away entirely. As the FS isn't generally unmounted in that case, you could trivially keep a per-mount (or superblock?) bit that says "I died" and set that instead of keeping per inode/whatever information.</p> <p>2018-04-10 18:43:56 Ted wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>If you are aware of a company who is willing to pay to have a new kernel feature implemented to meet your needs, we might be able to refer you to a company or a consultant who might be able to do that work.</p> </blockquote> <p>I find it a bit dissapointing response.

We can deal with the fact that an fsync failure is edge-triggered if there's a guarantee that every process doing so would get it. The fact that one needs to have an FD open from before any failing writes occurred to get a failure, <em>THAT'S</em> the big issue.</p> <p>Beyond postgres, it's a pretty common approach to do work on a lot of files without fsyncing, then iterate over the directory fsync everything, and <em>then</em> assume you're safe.

We can deal with the fact that an fsync failure is edge-triggered if there's a guarantee that every process doing so would get it.

I'm a bit surprised that anyone expects fsync() on a newly-opened fd to have any state from write() calls that predate the open. I can understand fsync() returning an error for any IO that happens within the context of that fsync(), but how far should it go back for reporting errors on that file? Forever?

OTOH if the error is permanent then reattempting the write isn't going to do any good and it's just going to cause the drive to go through the whole error handling dance again.

Ultimately the distribution will set up dm-removable automatically if the user requests it, much like it sets up dm-crypt automatically for laptop users upon request.</p> <p>My concern is that not all removable devices have a globally unique id number available in hardware so the kernel can tell whether or not it's the same device that has been plugged in. There are hueristics you could use -- for example, you could look at the file system uuid plus the last fsck time.

We could do that, but....yecchhhh.</p> <p>Reporting errors only in the case where the inode happened to stick around in the cache seems too unreliable for real-world usage, and might be problematic for some use cases. I'm also not sure it would really be helpful.</p> </blockquote> <p>So this is never going to be perfect but I think we could do good enough by: 1) Mark inodes that hit IO error. 2) If the inode gets evicted from memory we store the fact that we hit an error for this IO in a more space efficient data structure (sparse bitmap, radix tree, extent tree, whatever). 3) If the underlying device gets destroyed, we can just switch the whole SB to an error state and forget per inode info. 4) If there's too much of per-inode error info (probably per-fs configurable limit in terms of number of inodes), we would yell in the kernel log, switch the whole fs to the error state and forget per inode info.</p> <p>This way there won't be silent loss of IO errors. Memory usage would be reasonably limited. It could happen the whole fs would switch to error state "prematurely" but if that's a problem for the machine, admin could tune the limit for number of inodes to keep IO errors for...</p> <blockquote> <p>I think the crux of the matter here is not really about error reporting, per-se.</p> </blockquote> <p>I think this is related but a different question.</p> <blockquote> <p>I asked this at LSF last year, and got no real answer:</p> <p>When there is a writeback error, what should be done with the dirty page(s)?

It could be surprising for some applications to not see the results of their writes on a subsequent read after such an event.</p> <p>Maybe that's ok in the face of a writeback error though? IDK.</p> </blockquote> <p>I can see the admin wanting to rather kill the machine with OOM than having to deal with data loss due to IO errors (e.g. if he has HA server fail over set up). Or retry for some time before dropping the dirty data. Or do what we do now (possibly with invalidating pages as you say). As Dave said elsewhere there's not one strategy that's going to please everybody. So it might be beneficial to have this configurable like XFS has it for metadata.</p> <p>OTOH if I look at the problem from application developer POV, most apps will just declare game over at the face of IO errors (if they take care to check for them at all). And the sophisticated apps that will try some kind of error recovery have to be prepared that the data is just gone (as depending on what exactly the kernel does is rather fragile) so I'm not sure how much practical value the configurable behavior on writeback errors would bring.</p> <hr>    </div></div>
