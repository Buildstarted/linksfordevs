Born from years of experience at Amazon Go, Just Walk Out uses a combination of technologies to eliminate checkout lines. We now offer retailers the ability to leverage this technology in their stores to help bring fast and convenient checkout experiences to more shoppers.</p></div></div></div><div id=""><div id=""><div id=""><p>In Just Walk Out-enabled stores, shoppers enter the store using a credit card. They don't need to download an app or create an Amazon account. Our Just Walk Out technology detects what products shoppers take from or return to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When done shopping, they can just walk out and their credit card will be charged for the items in their virtual cart. If shoppers need a receipt, they can visit a kiosk in the store and enter their email address. A receipt will be emailed to them for this trip. If they use the same credit card to enter this or any other Just Walk Out-enabled store in the future, a receipt will be emailed to them automatically.</p></div></div><div id=""><p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/JWO-mktgsite/Icon-v4._CB1583768092_.png" alt="" title=""></p></div></div><div id=""><div id=""><div id=""><p>With Just Walk Out, Amazon provides retailers with proven technology that has operated with high reliability and accuracy for years in our stores. Now, we're enabling retailers to use this technology in their stores with their selection, merchandizing, and store associates to provide their shoppers with the ability to just walk out using our technology.</p></div></div></div><div id=""><p id=""><h4><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></h4></p><div id=""><div id=""><div id=""><div id=""><p id=""><h6><strong>What is Just Walk Out and why are you offering it to retailers?</strong></h6></p><div id=""><p>We built Just Walk Out technology leveraging the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning. Since launching Amazon Go years ago, many retailers have expressed an interest in offering similar checkout-free shopping experiences to their customers. We're excited to now offer the ability for retailers to leverage Just Walk Out technology from Amazon in their stores. By extending our technology to other retailers, more customers will delight in the Just Walk Out experience as they can take what they want and leave without stopping to check out.</p></div></div><div id=""><p id=""><h6><strong>How does Just Walk Out technology work?</strong></h6></p><div id=""><p>Just Walk Out technology uses a combination of sophisticated technologies to determine "who took what" from the store. When a shopper takes something off the shelf, it's added to their virtual cart. When the shopper puts the item back on the shelf, it comes out of their virtual cart. After they leave the store, they're charged for their purchases.</p></div></div><div id=""><p id=""><h6><strong>How long will it take to install Just Walk Out technology in a store?</strong></h6></p><div id=""><p>The installation of the technology can take as little as a few weeks from the time we have access to your store. For new store builds, we work with retailers as part of your construction or remodel plans. For existing stores, we work with retailers to install the technology while minimizing impact on current operations.</p></div></div><div id=""><p id=""><h6><strong>In what stores does Just Walk Out technology work?</strong></h6></p><div id=""><p>Our technology has broad applicability. It's great in places that have high demand, long lines, or wherever customers are pressed for time. The ability to quickly enter, grab what you want, and just walk out without stopping to check out is very appealing to customers.</p></div></div><div id=""><p id=""><h6><strong>Does this mean other retailers can open Amazon Go stores?</strong></h6></p><div id=""><p>No. We're offering retailers the opportunity to use our Just Walk Out technology in their stores.</p></div></div></div><div id=""><div id=""><p id=""><h6><strong>What is the customer experience in a Just Walk Out-enabled store?</strong></h6></p><div id=""><p>Shoppers enter the store with a credit card, grab what they want and just walk out - it's that easy. Even when the store is packed, shoppers can be in and out in seconds, as all they have to do is grab what they want and they're on their way.</p></div></div><div id=""><p id=""><h6><strong>What does Amazon provide with Just Walk Out technology?</strong></h6></p><div id=""><p>We provide all the necessary technologies to enable checkout-free shopping in a retailer's store and offer retailers 24/7 support via phone and email. The retailers we work with operate those stores with their own selection and associates.</p></div></div><div id=""><p id=""><h6><strong>If shoppers have questions about the store or need to make a return, who do they contact?</strong></h6></p><div id=""><p>Shoppers' customer service needs, including returns, are managed by the retailer directly.</p></div></div><div id=""><p id=""><h6><strong>Will people still be working in stores with Just Walk Out technology?</strong></h6></p><div id=""><p>Yes. Retailers will still employ store associates to greet and answer shoppers' questions, stock the shelves, check IDs for the purchasing of certain goods, and more - their roles have simply shifted to focus on more valuable activities.</p></div></div><div id=""><p id=""><h6><strong>What data does Just Walk Out technology collect from my shoppers?</strong></h6></p><div id=""><p>We only collect the data needed to provide shoppers with an accurate receipt. Shoppers can think of this as similar to typical security camera footage.</p></div></div><div id=""><p id=""><h6><strong>If I am interested, how can I get in touch?</strong></h6></p><div id=""><p>If you are a business interested in Just Walk Out, send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:jwo-interest@amazon.com">jwo-interest@amazon.com</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=""><div id=""><p>(c) 1996-2020, Amazon.com, Inc or its affiliates</p></div></div></div>
