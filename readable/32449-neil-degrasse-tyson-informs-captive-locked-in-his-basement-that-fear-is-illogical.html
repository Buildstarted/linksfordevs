Your tears make no logical sense, sir,” Tyson reportedly said, dragging a knife slowly across the chest of his victim. “I implore you to consider science and reason so that you stop sobbing.”</span></p><p><span>According to those familiar with the situation, Tyson has been known to kidnap and torture strangers after overhearing them publicly praise campy action movies, such as 2003’s </span><i><span>The Core.</span></i></p><p><span>“Your emotional response to spectacle rather than data unfortunately must be punished,” Tyson continued. “Of course, these killings will be entirely senseless if I only take one life. On average, across any 48 hours, we lose 500 to medical errors. I must increase my efforts in order to make a dent in the data.”</span></p><p><em>Check out the newest episode of the Hard Drive podcast where we watch and discuss every episode of 1989’s The Super Mario Bros.
