The owner plugs the security token into a system to grant access to a network service, according to investing and finance education portal Investopedia.</p><p>The supposed hack targeted names, email ID and passwords happened.</p><p>Bajpai said that the company stores only names and email IDs, not passwords. “We are a meta search engine, so the transactional or payment data goes to third party companies.”</p><p>With respect to passwords, Bajpai said that they are hashed or encrypted with a hashing algorithm. Such passwords are not easily unhashed while all leading websites globally too use it to secure user data.</p><p>Hashing is referred to representing any data in a unique set of characters.</p><p>“So even if someone allegedly gets access to data, it doesn’t mean they can hack that person’s account because there is literally no access to password,” said Bajpai.</p><p>Most of Ixigo users login through their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/google/">Google</a> and Facebook accounts or mobile numbers. Since mobile number login is OTP based which has two-factor authentication, it cannot be used to hack passwords. In terms of emails, Google and Facebook logins happen on a third party redirection model which are taken care of by Google and Facebook themselves,” said Bajpai.</p><div><p>Get live <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/" target="_blank">Stock Prices</a> from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/" target="_blank">Mutual Funds</a>, calculate your tax by <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/" target="_blank">Income Tax Calculator</a>, know market’s <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-gainers/" target="_blank">Top Gainers</a>, <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/nse-top-losers/" target="_blank">Top Losers</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/mutual-funds-india/equity-funds/" target="_blank">Best Equity Funds</a>.
