In my case, I‚Äôm defining in 2020 a PWA as a design pattern to develop app experiences using web technologies with different APIs, such as Service Workers for asset management, Web App Manifest for browser installation, Trusted Web Activities for Play Store distribution, among other.</p><figure class="fn fo fp fq fr fs cl cm paragraph-image"><figcaption class="bo eg gj gk gl cn cl cm gm gn bj ef">A modern PWA Cheat Sheet form my <a href="https://firt.mobi/talks" class="at cg hc hd he hf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JSConf Europe 2019 talk</a></figcaption></figure><h1 id="733f" class="ib hh dc bk bj hi de ic dg id ie if ig ih ii ij ik">üéñUsage</h1><p id="02c9" class="go gp dc bk gq b gr hu gt hv gv hw gx hx gz hy hb cu">It‚Äôs difficult to have information about how many companies are creating PWAs or how users are reacting to them in terms of installation. I didn‚Äôt particularly felt in 2019 an increase in companies going for PWAs or users using them more. There are some niches like people looking for privacy removing native apps, but it‚Äôs not the big market out there.</p><p id="48f7" class="go gp dc bk gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb cu">We saw during 2019 one of the most visited websites in the world going PWA: YouPorn, but we don‚Äôt have info on usage. You can see the info about the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/19/youporn-goes-progressive-with-new-mobile-web-apps-for-android-and-ios/" class="at cg hc hd he hf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">YP PWA here</a> (no porn in the link, open it with confidence.)</p><figure class="fn fo fp fq fr fs cl cm paragraph-image"><figcaption class="bo eg gj gk gl cn cl cm gm gn bj ef">One of the most visited website in the world is now a Progressive Web App</figcaption></figure><p id="50b7" class="go gp dc bk gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb cu">What it‚Äôs still new (for developers, website owners, and users) is that PWAs can be installed on the desktop. I didn‚Äôt see so many desktop-optimized PWAs yet, but from 2020 and Microsoft push with the new Edge we may see this growing. During 2019, Starbucks and Uber took the time to talk about their PWAs running on the desktop, such as in <a href="https://eng.uber.com/web-booking-flow/" class="at cg hc hd he hf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Building a more seamless booking flow for Uber</a>.</p><figure class="fn fo fp fq fr fs"><figcaption class="bo eg gj gk gl cn cl cm gm gn bj ef">Produck is one of the first desktop-optimized PWA that I found published early 2019</figcaption></figure><p id="2a89" class="go gp dc bk gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb cu">The only recent data we have about PWAs comes from Samsung Internet browser:</p><figure class="fn fo fp fq fr fs"><p id="6ea7" class="go gp dc bk gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb cu">So we have 80,000 different origins with at least one PWA inside in the period April-December 2019; while it‚Äôs not a fair count of different PWAs, it‚Äôs a good approximation. Samsung Internet counts for +6% of users, so it‚Äôs a good amount of users to take that value as representative for the whole web.</p><p id="49d3" class="go gp dc bk gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb cu">You can say it‚Äôs not so good compared with 2.9 million apps in the Play Store or 3.9 million apps in the App Store. However, we don‚Äôt know how many of those apps had at least one install in the past 9 months to have a fair comparison. Also, because we have the information on domains and not different PWAs, it might be a good idea to compare 80,000 with the number of different publishers in the stores, counting around 800,000 in the Play Store and 792,000 in the AppStore. Taking this amount, we can say there might be 10% of PWAs compared with native apps. But we need to remember, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/the-top-1-of-app-store-publishers-drive-80-of-new-downloads/" class="at cg hc hd he hf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">80% of new downloads from stores come from only 1% of publishers</a>.

It‚Äôs still a great feature that is hidden in public sight, and I didn‚Äôt see any updates for the future of the technology (there were ideas to connect native code with the TWA for example). TWAs are currently supported in Chrome. It‚Äôs based on the open protocol Custom Tabs (being renamed to Android Helper Browser Library), so other browsers such as Firefox and Samsung Internet will add support for it soon (it‚Äôs already available in Firefox Preview and Samsung announced it will bet there but <a href="https://link.medium.com/pNySTfhMW2" class="at cg hc hd he hf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will be discouraged</a>). That means the user will be able to change the engine she wants to use for PWAs from the Play Store.</p><figure class="fn fo fp fq fr fs cl cm paragraph-image"><figcaption class="bo eg gj gk gl cn cl cm gm gn bj ef">Samsung Galaxy Store is supporting web app submissions</figcaption></figure><p id="9848" class="go gp dc bk gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb cu">Samsung during 2019 added a simple way to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/using-twa" class="at cg hc hd he hf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">submit PWAs to the Galaxy Store</a> without any need for packaging ‚Äî what we all were expecting from Google Play Store. The feature is still manual (submission is done through an email address) and PWAs appear under a ‚Äúweb app‚Äù section which I‚Äôm not sure I like as users don‚Äôt care about the technology behind.

On Android, you can use the (weirdly named) <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/work/play/emm-api/managed-play-iframe" class="at cg hc hd he hf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Managed Google Play iframe</a> to distribute PWAs within enterprise users, which means users will find your PWA under their corporate play store. The Play Store will use the WebAPK minting service to create an APK from a URL and offer it to users. It‚Äôs unfortunate to see this in action for enterprise users and not for the public store for end-users; it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs not a technological barrier.</p><p id="665a" class="go gp dc bk gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb cu">On the Apple side, we have the Mobile Configuration file accepted by iOS and iPadOS. Using Apple Configurator 2 you can create these files that can include Web Clips (icons in the home screen). These icons will include a URL and a possible ‚ÄúFull screen‚Äù experience that is basically an installed PWA. You can sign the mobileconfig file or distribute the file unsigned, and if an iOS/iPadOS user accepts it, she will see the PWA icon(s) on the home screen.</p><figure class="fn fo fp fq fr fs cl cm paragraph-image"><p id="0c02" class="go gp dc bk gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb cu"><em class="is">Warning: I think this is bordering the edge of the known world, I‚Äôm not sure yet if the engine used by this web apps is the same that is being used when you install the PWA from Safari.

That‚Äôs why in this empire you will find better abilities this year, including more background execution mechanisms, hardware and platform access (such as Contacts, WebNFC, Shortcut menus for PWAs, Screen enumeration, Tabbed application mode, Window Application Placing) along with what‚Äôs already there (WebAssembly, WebRTC, WebPush, WebAuthn, WebShare, WebXR, RequestPayment, etc.)</li></ul><p id="1579" class="go gp dc bk gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb cu">Having said that, there are some features (mostly when talking about the Android platform) that are taking a different pace that in my opinion has to do with this internal fight between Android/Play Store and Chrome within Google: Trusted Web Activities evolution, Install badge in the omnibox, or the 2 years that it took to Chrome to support proper icons for Android 8+ with the new Maskable icon format. On desktop, Chrome seems to be moving faster when it has to do with platform integration.</p><ul class=""><li id="81d8" class="go gp dc bk gq b gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb ip iq ir"><strong class="gq io">WebKit kingdom</strong>: it‚Äôs known that the WebKit team (powering Safari) doesn‚Äôt follow the Chromium empire in its need for more power in the Web, and they are more cautious and interested in privacy and performance before abilities. Some abilities are currently there (such as WebAssembly, WebAuthn -initial release-, Sign In with Apple, Apple Pay, and RequestPayment), but others such as hardware access, WebPush or background execution don‚Äôt look like something that will happen anytime soon on WebKit.
