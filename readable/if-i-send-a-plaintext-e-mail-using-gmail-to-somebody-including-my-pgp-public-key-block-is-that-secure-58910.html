    <div itemprop="text">

<p>I've been trying to figure out "practical encryption" (AKA "PGP") for many years. As far as I can tell, this is not fundamentally flawed:</p>

<ol>
<li>I know Joe's e-mail address: cool_joe@gmail.com.</li>
<li>I have a Gmail e-mail address: me_78@gmail.com.</li>
<li>I have GPG installed on my PC.</li>
<li>I send a new e-mail to Joe consisting of the "PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK" extracted from GPG.</li>
<li>Joe received it and can now encrypt a text using that "PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK" of mine, reply to my e-mail, and I can then decrypt it and read his message. Inside this message, Joe has included his own such PGP public key block.</li>
<li>I use Joe's PGP public key block to reply to his message, and from this point on, we only send the actual messages (no key) encrypted with each other's keys, which we have stored on our PCs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there anything fundamentally wrong/insecure about this? Some concerns:</p>

<ol>
<li>By simply operating the e-mail service, Google knows my public key (but not Joe's, since that is embedded inside the encrypted blob). This doesn't actually matter, though, does it? They can't do anything with my public key? The only thing it can be used for is to encrypt text one-way which only I can decrypt, because only I have the <em>private</em> key on my computer?</li>
<li>If they decide to manipulate my initial e-mail message, changing the key I sent to Joe, then Joe's reply will be unreadable by me, since it's no longer encrypted using my public key, but Google's intercepted key. That means Joe and I won't be having any conversation beyond that initial e-mail from me and the first reply by him (which Google can read), but after that, nothing happens since I can't read/decrypt his reply?</li>
</ol>

        <p>As Stephen already said, the Achilles' Wheel on your security is making sure you are talking to Joe, and Joe being sure he is talking to you. If the initial key exchange is compromised, the third party will be able to read your messages, reencrypt and send to Joe, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The crypto does not matter unless you solve this issue. That's why on the HTTPS world, there's a special entity named CA (Certificate Authority). The CA is to make sure Google cannot obtain a certificate for Facebook, and so on. So unless a rogue CA issued the certificate, you can navigate to Google, and be sure you are on Google.</p>

<p>The initial key transfer is the critical one, and this can be done in a couple ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>in person</li>
<li>by out-of-band message (tweet, Instagram post, snail-mail)</li>
<li>referral by a friend in common (you know Bill, have his key saved, and Bill knows both of you, and shares both keys)</li>
</ul>

<p>After this exchange, your setup is pretty solid.</p>

<p>As long as you can be sure that they can only man-in-the-middle the initial mail then this is true. But if they can man-in-the-middle the following mails too then they could simply decrypt the message from Joe to you because it was actually encrypted to them and can encrypt it again for you since they know your public key.</p>

<p>To setup secure communication for email you would need to have some other secure communication channel already to exchange or at least verify the public key since otherwise a MITM could simply claim these identities and nobody could detect this.</p>

        <p>It creates a one time opportunity for an attacker to MITM (man in the middle) your certificate exchange and offer a different one instead. Hypothetically they could intercept and forward every message you send re-encrypted with the new attacker key. There are several mitigating factors though.</p>

<p>If both of you use the webmail client for gmail, there is minimal opportunity for an attacker to mess with your email, even though SMTP is not actually super secure.</p>

<p>After the key exchange you will know you are <em>mailing the same person</em>, whether attacker or legitimate. It is essentially a trust on first use thing, there are no further opportunities for an attack to happen.</p>

<p>The attacker would need to essentially MITM all if your emails, if they constantly got lost it would be a red flag.</p>

<p>There are suggestions that they entire key needs to be exchanged in a secure channel, this is <em>false</em>. You can email the public key block and then call or meet in person to exchange the certificate thumbprint--a secure hash of the key--to verify that it is valid.</p>
