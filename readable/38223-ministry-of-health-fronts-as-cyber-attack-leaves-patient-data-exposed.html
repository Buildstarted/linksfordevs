We have information as to who has been referred for those services."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> T큰&nbsp;Ora board chair Larry Jordan said he wanted to make it very clear that no GP notes had been exposed.&nbsp;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> "The main message is you can still trust your doctors and your medical centre."</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> The breach was first identified on August 5, when the hacker 'Vanda The God' posted a picture on the homepage of the Tu Ora website. Tu Ora then referred the hack to the National Cyber Security Centre, which found there had been four attacks&nbsp;dating back as far as 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> Two hacks appear to have been by 'hacktivists', while the other two seemed to be more sophisticated attempts to access data, Ministry of Health director-general of data and digital Shayne Hunter said.&nbsp;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> Since being alerted to the breach in early August, the Ministry of Health had instructed all DHBs and PHOs to report back on their systems. That report is due back in the next week.&nbsp;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> A hotline has been set up for people concerned about their private information: 0800 499 500.</p></div></div></div></div>
