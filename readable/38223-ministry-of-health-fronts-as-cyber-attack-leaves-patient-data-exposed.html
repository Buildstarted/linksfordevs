Contact us at <a href="mailto:newstips@stuff.co.nz">newstips@stuff.co.nz</a>.</strong></em></p><span></span><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> T&#x16B;&#xA0;Ora chief executive Martin Hefford the said hacker&#xA0;exposed a &quot;known vulnerability,&quot; which it was in the process of updating.</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> &quot;While this was an illegal cyber attack by criminals, keeping people&apos;s information safe is our responsibility and I&apos;m very sorry that we failed to do that.&quot;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> Hefford apologised to both the patients whose information was exposed, and the GP network.&#xA0;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> The personal information which may have been exposed includes enrolment information including name, date of birth, address, ethnicity, and national health number, whether you are a smoker or heavy drinker, whether you are due for immunisations or cervical screening, whether someone had undergone an X-ray or ultrasound, and information on chronic conditions like diabetes, including lab results for tests like blood sugar, and prescriptions.&#xA0;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> It also included information about mental health, which Hefford acknowledged was &quot;more sensitive and perhaps more distressing for people. We have information as to who has been referred for those services.&quot;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> T&#x16B;&#xA0;Ora board chair Larry Jordan said he wanted to make it very clear that no GP notes had been exposed.&#xA0;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> &quot;The main message is you can still trust your doctors and your medical centre.&quot;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> The breach was first identified on August 5, when the hacker &apos;Vanda The God&apos; posted a picture on the homepage of the Tu Ora website. Tu Ora then referred the hack to the National Cyber Security Centre, which found there had been four attacks&#xA0;dating back as far as 2016.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> Two hacks appear to have been by &apos;hacktivists&apos;, while the other two seemed to be more sophisticated attempts to access data, Ministry of Health director-general of data and digital Shayne Hunter said.&#xA0;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> Since being alerted to the breach in early August, the Ministry of Health had instructed all DHBs and PHOs to report back on their systems. That report is due back in the next week.&#xA0;</p><p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"> A hotline has been set up for people concerned about their private information: 0800 499 500.</p></div><p class="sics-component__story__source">Stuff</p></div>
