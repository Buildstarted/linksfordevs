    <h1>animates.co.nz data breach</h1>
    <div id="accordion"> <div> <p>We know that 2,700 customers were affected. We advise customers who&#x2019;ve purchased items on our website to take the following precautions:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Monitor credit card/debit activity closely. </strong>If you used a credit or debit card to make your purchase between June 29 and September 13, 2019, you should monitor your credit/debit card statements closely and report any unusual activity to your bank.</li> <li>If the credit/debit card you used on our website does not belong to you, please take steps to bring this email to the cardholder&apos;s attention so that they can take steps to prevent potential misuse.</li> <li><strong>Change similar passwords across other sites.</strong> If you use the same password that you used to access Animates across other websites (such as email, social media, online banking etc); we would encourage you to reset these passwords as a precaution.</li> <li>Keep a look out for email, telephone and text-based scams.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <p>Your Animates Petpoints loyalty points and any of your benefits have not been affected.</p> </div> <div> <p>The unauthorised third party access was caused by malicious software (malware) that infected our website and remained undetected until a security audit was carried out. There is a due process to follow and this takes a bit of time. We notified relevant privacy and legal authorities as soon as we became aware of the extent of the incident. Our customers were informed the next day.</p> </div> <div> <p>The new website uses a trusted third party payment gateway that meets the highest security standards set by our bank. We have engaged a leading IT security information company to undertake strict security audits and certification to protect our customer data.</p> </div> <div> <p>We do not hold customer credit / debit card data on our servers, this is held with the banks via the secure payment gateway which our website uses.</p> <p>Other customer data is held on secure data services with a third party provider who specialise in large corporate client services, including large NZ insurance providers,&#xA0; airlines, and governmental organisations.</p> </div> <div> <p>Cyber security is an area requiring constant vigilance and education. No organisation is immune from cyber threats.</p> </div> <div> <p>We do not hold customer credit / debit card data on our servers, this is held with the banks via the secure payment gateway which our website uses.</p> <p>Other customer data is held on secure data services with a third party provider, who specialises in large corporate client data services, which includes large NZ insurance providers,&#xA0; airlines, and governmental organisations.</p> <p>We can remove your personal data at any time if you request this. This will also remove you from our loyalty program.</p> </div> <div> <p>Cyber security is an area requiring constant vigilance and education. No organisation is immune from cyber threats and we are mitigating their impact through the use of highly secure website technology and responsible corporate digital citizenship.</p> </div> <div> <p>We have engaged a leading IT security information company, Aura, to undertake strict security audits and certification to protect our customer data.</p> </div> <div> <p>This has been a coincidence, as we have been working on launching a new, modern ecommerce site. This has been an ongoing project for over a year, that will enable more modern customer-centric technology including a mobile-optimised site, the ability to launch a click-and-collect service, membership programs and advanced features like a Google Maps-integrated Store Finder.</p> </div> <div> <p>We do not hold customer credit / debit card data on our servers; this is held with the banks via the secure payment gateway which our website uses.&#xA0;</p> <p>Other customer data is held on secure data services with a third party provider, who specialises in large corporate client services, which includes large NZ insurance providers,&#xA0; airlines, and governmental organisations. We keep this data for an indefinite time, as it is related to our customer loyalty program. You can request this data to be removed at any time.</p> </div> <div> <p>We know that 2,700 customers have been affected that transacted on the site during the affected period. We advise customers who&#x2019;ve purchased items on our website to take the following precautions:</p> <ul> <li>Monitor credit card/debit activity closely</li> <li>Change similar passwords across other sites</li> <li>Keep a look out for email, telephone and text-based scams</li> </ul> <p>We&#x2019;ve engaged third party IT security experts to investigate all possible vulnerabilities and there is a chance we may not find this who has been impacted by this incident. We are taking a proactive approach to directly notify the potential risk of all 20,000 customers that have entered personal information on our site.</p> </div> <div> <p>It has more modern, customer-centric features. The site is optimised for mobile use, and allows us to launch membership programs, a click-and-collect service, and advanced features like a Google Maps-integrated Store Finder.</p> </div> <div> <p>We are endeavouring to manually process ongoing customer orders, to maintain our service to our customers. We will be processing payments as soon as the new website goes live.&#xA0; If there has been a credit card number change, we will follow up to change the information with you.</p> </div> <div> <p>No, store transactions have not been affected.</p> </div> <div> <p>There has been no associated breach involving social media, this was only the old website that was breached.</p> </div> <div> <p>No. We use our customer information for the intended purpose it was collected for with your opt-in permission.&#xA0;</p> </div> <div> <p>It is extremely unlikely your computer has been compromised by our website; however many devices are infected with malware undetected by the owner.&#xA0; It is always good practice to have up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware detection software on your devices.</p> </div> <div> <p>Our hosting and development partners continually perform security scans and install updates on the website to ensure it is up-to-date to eliminate any vulnerabilities that emerge. Our hosts also monitor for any attempted intrusions.</p> <p>Internally we use something called two-factor authentication and we have a system in place (IP whitelisting) to mitigate unauthorised access the website as well.</p> </div> </div>
