        <p><strong>The <a href="https://www.ahip.org/keeping-americans-safe-from-coronavirus-covid-19/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CDC covers the cost of testing itself</a></strong>, however, this may not be the only type of cost incurred.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/upshot/coronavirus-surprise-medical-bills.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">A recent New York Times article</a> presents a case study of exactly the sort of scenario described in the question.</p>

<p>Americans who were living in China and evacuated from Wuhan did not have health insurance in the US and were given a $3,918 bill for care during quarantine, including $2,598 for ambulance transportation. Neither ultimately tested positive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He did receive a document upon leaving quarantine directing him to contact a government email address with any medical bills. He sent an email on Feb. 24 detailing the charges and asking what would be done.</p>
  
  <p>“My question is why are we being charged for these stays, if they were mandatory and we had no choice in the matter?” Mr. Wucinski wrote in his message.</p>
  
  <p>He has not received a response, he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since then, after being contacted by the Times, the hospital stated the bill was in error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When contacted by The New York Times, a Rady Children’s Hospital spokesman said the physicians’ bill had been sent in error and that the family would not be held responsible for the charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>..but it is not clear whether this is a matter of policy or a public relations move by the hospital, nor is it clear how these matters will be handled going forward. It also does not yet resolve the $2600 ambulance bill (of course this is all still pending).</p>

<p>The government can order mandatory quarantines, but as far as who pays:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is no uniform practice,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. “They do have the powers, but they’ve almost never used them in modern times.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Without some new government intervention, it seems that for now costs will either be charged to patients or simply absorbed by the treating facilities (by not billing).</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>The <a href="https://www.aha.org/press-releases/2020-02-27-aha-ana-urge-congress-quickly-fund-health-care-readiness-coronavirus" rel="nofollow noreferrer">American Hospital Association and American Nurses Association</a> on Feb 27, 2020 have asked for the government to fund care related to the epidemic. It seems likely that there will be further political fights over what exactly is done next.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>update: As of March 4th, 2020, an agreement was reached in the House on a bill for COVID-2019 funding, which is expected to pass there and later in the Senate. This bill does not address how to deal with care and testing for the uninsured, though it includes state and local funding. It's unclear at this time how those funds could/will be used:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Congress didn't explicitly address how to handle funding for mandatory quarantines or the uninsured. The package would send $950 million in state and local grants, with half of the money due within 30 days. States will receive a minimum of $4 million.</p>
