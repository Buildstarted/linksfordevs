The items are grouped into three categories. Depending on your interests, your level of familiarity with GitHub, and your level of comfort with creating independent content, you can choose from the following three categories:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Maintenance</strong>. These work items involve such things as correcting broken links, correcting spelling or stylistic errors, or modifying the formatting of content to improve the overall appearance of the documentation on docs.microsoft.com.</p></li><li><p><strong>Content updates</strong>. Parts of our massive documentation set have become stale and are in need of updating. Some topics don't do a good job of addressing the issues that developers face when using a technology and require revision and refocusing. Migration to a new publishing platform has created duplication and, in some cases, triplication of largely identical topics that needs to be addressed through a process of consolidation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Authoring new content</strong>. Every documentation set has gaps. We welcome community contributions to address those gaps. We've identified some of the topics and topic areas for which we would like to see content, but the list is not exhaustive. You may want to contribute a topic in a technology area about which you feel passionate that isn't on the list.</p></li></ul><p>All of these work items are available. Two additional columns contain items for which work either has begun or has been completed.</p><p>If you're interested in helping to migrate existing .NET Framework code found on <a href="https://code.msdn.microsoft.com" rel="nofollow">Code Gallery</a> to .NET code stored on <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/samples">GitHub</a> and downloadable using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browser" rel="nofollow">Sample Browser</a>, see the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/docs/projects/88">Code Gallery Migration</a> project.</p></div></div></div></div>
