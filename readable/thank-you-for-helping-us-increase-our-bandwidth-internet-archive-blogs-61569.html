<p>Last week the Internet Archive upped our bandwidth capacity 30%, based on increased usage and increased financial support.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>This is our outbound bandwidth graph that has several stories to tell…</p>



<p>A year ago, usage was 30Gbits/sec. At the beginning of this year, we were at 40Gbits/sec, and we were handling it.&nbsp; That is <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=40gigabits%2Fsec+in+Petabytes%2Fmonth">13 Petabytes of downloads per month</a>.&nbsp; This has served millions of users to materials in the wayback machine, those listening 78 RPMs, those browsing digitized books, streaming from the TV archive, etc.&nbsp; We were about the 250th most popular website according to Alexa Internet.</p>



<p>Then Covid-19 hit and demand rocketed to 50Gbits/sec and overran our network infrastructure’s ability to handle it.&nbsp; So much so, our network statistics probes had difficulty collecting data (hence the white spots in the graphs).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We bought a second router with new line cards, and got it installed and running (and none of this is easy during a pandemic), and increased our capacity from 47Gbits/sec peak to 62Gbits/sec peak. &nbsp; And we are handling it better, but it is still consumed.</p>



<p>Alexa Internet now says we are about the <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/archive.org">160th most popular website</a>.</p>



<p>So now we are looking at the next steps up, which will take more equipment and is more wizardry, but we are working on it.</p>



<p>Thank you again for the support, and if you would like to donate more, please know it is going to build collections to serve millions.&nbsp; <a href="https://archive.org/donate">https://archive.org/donate</a></p>
