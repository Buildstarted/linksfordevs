I have lost hours of work within a few minutes due to a petty CEO’s decision to arbitrarily punish a paying customer because of a minor complaint. This wasn’t the “the future of publishing” I was expecting. I had only high praise for Ghost, as anyone can attest by my Twitter timeline. The moment I had a complaint, everything was gone. </p><p>I want to apologise to my subscribers for not delivering new content this week, and for failing to deliver on the promise of a new website. Right now, I’m really angry and I’m not exactly sure what to do next. Ghost had (until today) offered a smooth UI and excellent customer care, compared to Substack which have repeatedly ignored emails, left bugs running, and haven’t been clear with their payment system. Now, not only is my website gone, but it’s clear to me that the sheer capriciousness of this move by Ghost’s CEO John O’Nolan means Ghost is unsafe for anyone who dares to voice what is an otherwise-ordinary complaint. If you complain, you could risk losing your website in much the same way I did, in a matter of minutes.</p><p>I may continue to publish on Substack after all. Even if they ignore their customers, they don’t arbitrarily wipe their websites and kick them out. I may try and find another platform that I can trust not to act in a petulant and unprofessional manner. All I can say is that if you are considering building a website or know someone who is - dont be naive like me and recommend Ghost. <strong>Avoid Ghost at all costs, or it will cost you.</strong></p><p>I’m going to try and gather myself to get Post Apathy back on track. This is a setback, but the demand is high and I really enjoy compiling the newsletters and writing the original essays, so things will get back to normal soon. I want to apologise again and thank you for your patience.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://postapathy.substack.com/p/i-was-building-a-new-website-for?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://postapathy.substack.com/p/i-was-building-a-new-website-for?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>This post has really blown up.
