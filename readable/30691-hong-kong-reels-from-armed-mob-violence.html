</figure><p class="story-body__introduction">Hong Kong has been left in shock after a night of violence on Sunday, which saw dozens of masked men storm a train station.</p><p>The men - dressed in white shirts and suspected to be triad gangsters - assaulted pro-democracy protesters and passers-by in the Yuen Long area.</p><p>This is the first time this kind of violence has been seen in the ongoing anti-extradition demonstrations. </p><p>Several lawmakers questioned why police were slow to arrive at the scene. </p><p>Footage posted on social media showed dozens of men attacking people with wooden rods and metal sticks inside the station.</p><p>Forty-five people were injured, with one person in critical condition.</p><figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"> </figure><p>Hong Kong&apos;s Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters the gang attacks were &quot;shocking&quot;. She also condemned protesters for defacing China&apos;s main representative office in the city earlier on Sunday.</p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What happened? </h2><p>Pro-democracy protesters were set upon as they travelled back from a rally in the centre of Hong Kong, where riot police had fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters.</p><p>The masked men stormed Yuen Long MTR station at about 22:30 local time (14:30 GMT).</p><figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"> </figure><figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"> </figure><p>Local media said they were targeting people dressed in black - the colour most protesters were wearing. </p><p>In a statement, the government said: &quot;This is absolutely unacceptable to Hong Kong as a society that observes the rule of law. The SAR [Special Administrative Region] Government strongly condemns any violence and will seriously take enforcement actions.&quot;</p><p>One journalist, Gwyneth Ho, was attacked while she was in the middle of live streaming for news website Stand News. She is currently in hospital. </p><figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"> </figure><p>The Hong Kong Journalist Association said some reporters on the scene had equipment seized. </p><p>One witness - Galileo Cheng, 34 - told the BBC he had suffered several blows to his back and arms when he stepped in to try to help Ms Ho.</p><p>He said he saw another woman with a baby being assaulted too. </p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Who are the men?</h2><p>It is not known who organised the attack.</p><p>Opposition lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting suggested the mob had ties to organised crime syndicates.</p><p>&quot;Is Hong Kong now allowing triads to do what they want, beating up people on the street with weapons?&quot; he asked reporters.</p><p>Another pro-democracy lawmaker, Ray Chan, tweeted a complaint about the police response. &quot;Hong Kong has one of the world&apos;s highest cop to population ratio ... Where were [they?]&quot;</p><p>Video footage also surfaced of pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho, shaking hands with men in white and giving them the thumbs-up signal.</p><p>On Facebook, he denied a connection with the men and said he was just responding to their greetings when they recognised him on the street after he left a restaurant. </p><p>His office was later ransacked. </p><figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"> <div class="image-and-copyright-container"> <span class="off-screen">Image copyright</span> <span class="story-image-copyright">AFP/Getty Images</span> </div> </figure><p>Police on Monday said they had not made any arrests but were still carrying out investigations.</p><p>Some of the assailants did not seem too concerned about masking their identity, posting selfies online, before during and after the attack, reported the BBC&apos;s China correspondent Stephen McDonell.</p><figure class="media-landscape no-caption body-width"> </figure><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">On the streets of Yuen Long</h2><p><strong>By Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, Hong Kong</strong></p><p>Yuen Long is a centuries-old farming and trading town, which has hugely expanded in recent decades. Most of its village leaders and their clans are pro-China. </p><p>On Sunday evening, people began to share photos online that showed coach loads of men in white shirts congregating in the area. </p><p>Later - after the train station attacks - many of these men were seen running back to the surrounding villages, intensifying speculation that they were backed by the locals, if not hired by them. </p><p>Pro-democracy demonstrators have now announced that they want to move a pre-planned rally to Yuen Long next Sunday as a reaction to the outburst of violence. Until now all rallies have been held more centrally.</p><p>One villager told me that local clans are concerned by the shift, as it feels like people are &quot;messing around on their doorstep&quot;. He said they consider the protesters to be thugs who need to be taught a lesson. </p><figure class="media-landscape no-caption body-width"> </figure><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What led up to this?</h2><p>Mass protests have been held for weeks, initially over an extradition deal with mainland China, which the Hong Kong government has since suspended.</p><p>The unrest has now spread to cover broader demands for democratic reform and reflect concerns that freedoms are being eroded.</p><figure class="media-with-caption"> <div class="player-with-placeholder"> <img class="media-placeholder player-with-placeholder__image narrative-video-placeholder" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p07hgt6j.jpg"> <p class="player-with-placeholder__caption">Media playback is unsupported on your device</p> </div> <figcaption class="media-with-caption__caption"><span class="off-screen">Media caption</span>Tear gas was fired at the Hong Kong pro-democracy protest on Sunday</figcaption>
</figure><p>In a rare act, protesters defaced the liaison office, China&apos;s central government building, on Sunday. One of the graffiti slogans read: &quot;You taught us peaceful marches are useless.&quot;</p><p>Ms Lam strongly condemned the vandalism by &quot;radical demonstrators&quot;, saying they had acted &quot;maliciously&quot; and &quot;challenged the nation&apos;s sovereignty&quot;. </p><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width"> <figcaption class="media-caption"> <span class="off-screen">Image caption</span> <span class="media-caption__text"> A national emblem was splashed with paint outside the Chinese Liaison Office on Sunday </span> </figcaption> </figure><p>Some protesters also covered CCTV cameras outside a police station with spray paint. </p><p>Organisers of the protest say more than 430,000 people took part in the rally, but police put the figure at 138,000.</p><p>On Saturday a counter-rally, in support of the police and against protest violence, drew 300,000 people according to organisers and 103,000 people according to police.</p><figure class="media-with-caption"> <div class="player-with-placeholder"> <img class="media-placeholder player-with-placeholder__image narrative-video-placeholder" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p07hf806.jpg"> <p class="player-with-placeholder__caption">Media playback is unsupported on your device</p> </div> <figcaption class="media-with-caption__caption"><span class="off-screen">Media caption</span>&quot;You are fake news&quot; - BBC correspondent heckled live on air during Saturday&apos;s rally</figcaption>
</figure><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">How did this wave of protests start?</h2><p>They were sparked by the proposed extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to China for trial.</p><p>Critics said it would undermine Hong Kong&apos;s judicial independence and could be used to target those who spoke out against the Chinese government.</p><p><a href="/news/world-asia-pacific-16526765" class="story-body__link">Read more about Hong Kong&apos;s history</a></p><p>The former British colony is part of China but run under a &quot;one country, two systems&quot; arrangement that guarantees it a level of autonomy.
