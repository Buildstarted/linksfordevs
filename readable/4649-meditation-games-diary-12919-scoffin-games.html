Mark your calendars for the 29th of January next year. <a href="https://twitter.com/martin_cohen?lang=en">Martin Cohen’s</a><a href="http://meditations.games/"><em>Meditations</em></a> game involves petting a dog and it is a wonderfully cute experience that I recommend to everyone. Unless you dislike dogs, then the game isn’t for you. If you like dogs and have a good sense of humor, then this is totally for you and is the game of the year. No game will possibly beat “That one game from 1/29/19 where you pet a dog and it is funny” on my GOTY list this year. Unless a game is very good. Then maybe. Well, that is all. Is it because I am very tired and worked way too hard tonight? No. It is because I don’t want to spoil this amazing moment for you. Now, please excuse me as I go to sleep because I worked way too hard writing these tonight. Just remember to download <em>Meditations</em> and play it on 1/29/20. Write it down, get a tattoo of it, do everything you possibly can to remember that date.<br></p><div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled"><h3 class="jp-relatedposts-headline"><em>Related</em></h3></div></div></div></div></div>
