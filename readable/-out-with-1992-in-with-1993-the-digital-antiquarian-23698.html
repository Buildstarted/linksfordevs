<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
														<p>First, the bad news: I’m afraid I won’t have a new article for you this Friday. My wife Dorte and I are going to take a long weekend in beautiful Bornholm, and I’ve been using this shortened work week to do some preparations for my next few months of writing. Both this site and <em>The Analog Antiquarian</em> will be pushed back one week because of this.</p>
<p>By way of compensation, though, I do have <a href="https://www.filfre.net/the-digital-antiquarian-e-book-library">a new ebook</a> for you, covering 1992 in this blog’s chronology. As usual, its existence is down to the good offices of Richard Lindner. You’ll find his email address on the title page of the ebook, so if you enjoy it, by all means send him an email to thank him.</p>
<p>A new ebook means, of course, that we’ve made it through another year. In fact, we’ve already started on 1993 with the <em>Return to Zork</em> coverage.</p>
<p>This one isn’t just any old year: a strong argument could be made that 1993 was <em>the</em> pivotal year in the entire history of computer gaming, the dividing line between its antiquity and modernity. For this was the year when CD-ROM finally went mainstream, virtually eliminating any and all technical restrictions on the <em>size</em> of games. The transformation this wrought on the graphics and sound of games, on their budgets, on their potential consumer appeal, and, indeed, on their very <em>nature</em> is almost impossible to overstate. We’ll have to wait until the rise of ubiquitous digital distribution well into the 2000s before we again see any single technology remotely as disruptive.</p>
<p>But as if the CD-ROM revolution wasn’t enough to make 1993 a special year, there was also the 3D graphics revolution, as exemplified by <em>Doom</em>, the game many would doubtless consider <em>the</em> game of the 1990s, at least in terms of pure populist appeal.</p>
<p>In addition to these two seismic events, the year is positively bursting with other themes, technologies, and franchises that remain inescapable today. An exciting time indeed.</p>
<p>So, here’s a broad outline of the specific topics I anticipate covering as we make our way through this year for the ages. (Needless to say, if you want to be totally surprised by each new article, skip this section!)</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to all of the multimedia flash that marked 1993, it was also the year when the groundwork for an Interactive Fiction Renaissance was laid, thanks to a game called <em>Curses!</em> which re-purposed Infocom’s legendary Z-Machine for its own ends. We’ll look at where the technology to make that seminal title came from as well as the game itself.</li>
<li>In the view of many fans, 1993 was the year that LucasArts peaked as a maker of graphic adventures, with perhaps the two most beloved games they ever made that don’t have “Monkey Island” in their names. Both will get their due here.</li>
<li>1993 was the year that Sierra went into an economic tailspin, thanks to budgets and multimedia ambitions that were increasing even faster than sales. We’ll follow them as they start down this beginning of the road to acquisition and eventual oblivion — and we’ll also look at some of Sierra’s individual adventure games from the year, especially the much-loved first <em>Gabriel Knight</em> title.</li>
<li>1993 was the year that Legend Entertainment finally had to face market realities and drop the parser from their adventure games, marking the definitive end of the text adventure as a commercial proposition. (Lucky that aforementioned amateur Renaissance was waiting in the wings, eh?) We’ll look at this end of Legend’s first era and beginning of their second, during which they became a maker of point-and-click adventures.</li>
<li>1993 was the year that <em>Alone in the Dark</em> invented the survival-horror genre. We’ll look at where that game came from and how it holds up today.</li>
<li>1993 was the last big year in CRPGs for quite some time, as a glut of samey titles tried gamers’ patience past the breaking point. We’ll look at Sierra’s <em>Betrayal at Krondor</em>, one of the less samey titles, and also at how the end of the CRPG gravy train affected Origin Systems and SSI, two of the leading practitioners of the genre.</li>
<li>1993 was the year that the wheels came off for Commodore even in Europe, thanks to new Amiga models that arrived as too little, too late. We’ll look at the sad end of a company and a platform that once held so much promise.</li>
<li>1993 was the year of the sequel to <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/10/games-on-the-mersey-part-5-the-lemmings-effect"><em>Lemmings</em></a>! Enough said.</li>
<li>1993 was the year of a little game from Interplay that I’ve always wished I could like more, <em>Buzz Aldrin’s Race into Space</em>. We’ll use the occasion of its release to examine the checkered history of space-program management simulations in general, a sub-genre that seems like it ought to have worked beautifully but somehow never quite did.</li>
<li>1993 was the year of <em>Master of Orion</em>, perhaps not the first grand 4X space opera in absolute terms but the one to which every subsequent game of the type would always be compared. Enough said.</li>
<li>1993 was the year when shareware peaked. We’ll look at this rich culture of amateurs and semi-professionals making games of many stripes and asking people to pay for them <em>after</em> they got them.</li>
<li>1993 was the year that <em>The 7th Guest</em>, the poster child for form over substance in gaming, popularized SVGA graphics, pushing the industry onward at last after six years stuck on the VGA standard. Along with <em>The 7th Guest</em> itself and the meteoric rise and fall of its maker Trilobyte, we’ll find out how a computer industry that had always looked to IBM to set its standards finally learned to drive its own technological evolution in a world where IBM had become all but irrelevant.</li>
<li>1993 was the year of <em>Myst</em>, the best-selling adventure game in history. Was it a brilliant artistic creation, or did it ruin adventure games for the rest of the decade? Or are both things true? We shall investigate.</li>
<li>And 1993 was, as mentioned, the year of <em>Doom</em>, the yang to <em>Myst</em>‘s yin, the only shareware product ever to make its sellers multi-millionaires. We’ll try to address the many and varied aspects of what some would consider to be the most iconic computer game of all time. We’ll start with its incredible technology, end with the way its defiantly low-concept, ultra-violent personality coarsened the culture of gaming, and cover a heck of a lot of ground in between.</li>
</ul>
<p>As some of that last bullet point would imply, not everything that happened in 1993 was unadulteratedly positive, but it was all important. And certainly the year produced more than its share of classic games that still stand up wonderfully today. I’m looking forward to digging into it.</p>
<p>So, let me close by thanking all of you who support this ongoing project in one way or another. Without you, it just wouldn’t be possible. If you’ve been reading for a while and you haven’t yet become a supporter, please do think about contributing through Patreon or PayPal (you’ll find the links in the right-hand sidebar). It really does make all the difference in the world to my ability to continue this work. And if you’re interested in history more generally, do check out <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/"><em>The Analog Antiquarian</em></a> as well. I’m very proud of the writing I’m doing there.</p>
<p>See you all in a week and half, when we’ll buckle down and get started on the to-do list above. Until then, thanks again for being the best readers in the world!</p>
