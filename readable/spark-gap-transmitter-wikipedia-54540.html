<p>A <b>spark-gap transmitter</b> is an obsolete type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter" title="Transmitter">radio transmitter</a> which generates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave" title="Radio wave">radio waves</a> by means of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_spark" title="Electric spark">electric spark</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Hempstead_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Hempstead-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Morris_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Morris-2">[2]</a></sup> Spark-gap transmitters were the first type of radio transmitter, and were the main type used during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy" title="Wireless telegraphy">wireless telegraphy</a> or "spark" era, the first three decades of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio" title="Radio">radio</a>, from 1887 to the end of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_1" title="World War 1">World War 1</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Champness_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Champness-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Terman_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Terman-4">[4]</a></sup> German physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz" title="Heinrich Hertz">Heinrich Hertz</a> built the first experimental spark-gap transmitters in 1887, with which he proved the existence of radio waves and studied their properties.
</p><p>A fundamental limitation of spark-gap transmitters is that they generate a series of brief transient pulses of radio waves called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damped_wave" title="Damped wave">damped waves</a>; they are unable to produce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave" title="Continuous wave">continuous waves</a> used to carry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal" title="Audio signal">audio</a> (sound) in modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_broadcasting" title="AM broadcasting">AM</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting" title="FM broadcasting">FM</a> radio transmission. So spark-gap transmitters could not transmit audio, and instead transmitted information by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiotelegraphy" title="Radiotelegraphy">radiotelegraphy</a>; the operator switched the transmitter on and off with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph_key" title="Telegraph key">telegraph key</a>, creating pulses of radio waves to spell out text messages in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" title="Morse code">Morse code</a>.
</p><p>The first practical spark gap transmitters and receivers for radiotelegraphy communication were developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi" title="Guglielmo Marconi">Guglielmo Marconi</a> around 1896. One of the first uses for spark-gap transmitters was on ships, to communicate with shore and broadcast a distress call if the ship was sinking. They played a crucial role in maritime rescues such as the 1912 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic" title="RMS Titanic">RMS <i>Titanic</i></a> disaster. After World War 1, transmitters based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube" title="Vacuum tube">vacuum tubes</a> were developed, which were cheaper and produced continuous waves which had a greater range, produced less interference, and could also carry audio, making spark transmitters obsolete by 1920. The radio signals produced by spark-gap transmitters are electrically "noisy"; they have a wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing)" title="Bandwidth (signal processing)">bandwidth</a>, creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency_interference" title="Radio frequency interference">radio frequency interference</a> (RFI) that can disrupt other radio transmissions. This type of radio emission has been prohibited by international law since 1934.<sup id="cite_ref-FCC_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-FCC-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Schroeder_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-Schroeder-6">[6]</a></sup>

A resonant circuit consists of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor" title="Capacitor">capacitor</a> (in early days a type called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyden_jar" title="Leyden jar">Leyden jar</a>) which stores high-voltage electricity from the transformer, and a coil of wire called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor" title="Inductor">inductor</a> or tuning coil, connected together. The values of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance" title="Capacitance">capacitance</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductance" title="Inductance">inductance</a> determine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency" title="Frequency">frequency</a> of the radio waves produced.
<ul><li>The earliest spark-gap transmitters before 1897 did not have a resonant circuit; the antenna performed this function, acting as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonator" title="Resonator">resonator</a>.</li>
<li>Most spark transmitters had two resonant circuits coupled together with an air core transformer called a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_transformer" title="Resonant transformer">resonant transformer</a></i> or <i>oscillation transformer</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-CodellaSparkRadio_10-2"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaSparkRadio-10">[10]</a></sup> This was called an <i>inductively-coupled</i> transmitter. The spark gap and capacitor connected to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_winding" title="Primary winding">primary winding</a> of the transformer made one resonant circuit, which generated the oscillating current. The oscillating current in the primary winding created an oscillating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic field</a> that induced current in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_winding" title="Secondary winding">secondary winding</a>. The antenna and ground were connected to the secondary winding. The capacitance of the antenna resonated with the secondary winding to make a second resonant circuit. The two resonant circuits were tuned to the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_frequency" title="Resonant frequency">resonant frequency</a>. The advantage of this circuit was that the oscillating current persisted in the antenna circuit even after the spark stopped, creating long, ringing, lightly damped waves, in which the energy was concentrated in a narrower <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing)" title="Bandwidth (signal processing)">bandwidth</a>, creating less interference to other transmitters.</li></ul></li>

<p>The transmitter works in a rapid repeating cycle in which the capacitor is charged to a high voltage by the transformer and discharged through the coil by a spark across the spark gap.<sup id="cite_ref-CodellaSparkRadio_10-3"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaSparkRadio-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Nahin4_13-0"><a href="#cite_note-Nahin4-13">[13]</a></sup> The impulsive spark excites the resonant circuit to "ring" like a bell, producing a brief oscillating current which is radiated as electromagnetic waves by the antenna.<sup id="cite_ref-CodellaSparkRadio_10-4"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaSparkRadio-10">[10]</a></sup> The transmitter repeats this cycle at a rapid rate, so the spark appeared continuous, and the radio signal sounded like a whine or buzz in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_receiver" title="Radio receiver">radio receiver</a>.
</p>
<div><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Massie_spark_gap.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Massie_spark_gap.jpg/220px-Massie_spark_gap.jpg" decoding="async" width="220" height="165" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Massie_spark_gap.jpg/330px-Massie_spark_gap.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Massie_spark_gap.jpg/440px-Massie_spark_gap.jpg 2x" data-file-width="640" data-file-height="480"></a></p></div></div>
<ol><li>The cycle begins when current from the transformer charges up the capacitor, storing electric charge on its plates. While the capacitor is charging the spark gap is in its nonconductive state, preventing the charge from escaping through the coil.</li>
<li>When the voltage on the capacitor reaches the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdown_voltage" title="Breakdown voltage">breakdown voltage</a> of the spark gap, the air in the gap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization" title="Ionization">ionizes</a>, starting an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_spark" title="Electric spark">electric spark</a>, reducing its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance" title="Electrical resistance">resistance</a> to a very low level (usually less than one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm" title="Ohm">ohm</a>). This closes the circuit between the capacitor and the coil.</li>
<li>The charge on the capacitor discharges as a current through the coil and spark gap. Due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductance" title="Inductance">inductance</a> of the coil when the capacitor voltage reaches zero the current doesn't stop but keeps flowing, charging the capacitor plates with an opposite polarity, until the charge is stored in the capacitor again, on the opposite plates. Then the process repeats, with the charge flowing in the opposite direction through the coil. This continues, resulting in oscillating currents flowing rapidly back and forth between the plates of the capacitor through the coil and spark gap.</li>
<li>The resonant circuit is connected to the antenna, so these oscillating currents also flow in the antenna, charging and discharging it. The current creates an oscillating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic field</a> around the antenna, while the voltage creates an oscillating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field" title="Electric field">electric field</a>. These oscillating fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a radio wave.</li>
<li>The energy in the resonant circuit is limited to the amount of energy originally stored in the capacitor. The radiated radio waves, along with the heat generated by the spark, uses up this energy, causing the oscillations to decrease quickly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude" title="Amplitude">amplitude</a> to zero. When the oscillating electric current in the primary circuit has decreased to a point where it is insufficient to keep the air in the spark gap ionized, the spark stops, opening the resonant circuit, and stopping the oscillations. In a transmitter with two resonant circuits, the oscillations in the secondary circuit and antenna may continue some time after the spark has terminated. Then the transformer begins charging the capacitor again, and the whole cycle repeats.</li></ol>
<p>The cycle is very rapid, taking less than a millisecond. With each spark, this cycle produces a radio signal consisting of an oscillating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusoidal" title="Sinusoidal">sinusoidal</a> wave that increases rapidly to a high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude" title="Amplitude">amplitude</a> and decreases <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay" title="Exponential decay">exponentially</a> to zero, called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damped_wave" title="Damped wave">damped wave</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-CodellaSparkRadio_10-5"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaSparkRadio-10">[10]</a></sup> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency" title="Frequency">frequency</a> <span></span> of the oscillations, which is the frequency of the emitted radio waves, is equal to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_frequency" title="Resonant frequency">resonant frequency</a> of the resonant circuit, determined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance" title="Capacitance">capacitance</a> <span></span> of the capacitor and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductance" title="Inductance">inductance</a> <span></span> of the coil:
</p>
<dl><dd><span></span></dd></dl>
<p>The transmitter repeats this cycle rapidly, so the output is a repeating string of damped waves. This is equivalent to a radio signal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation" title="Amplitude modulation">amplitude modulated</a> with a steady frequency, so it could be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demodulation" title="Demodulation">demodulated</a> in a radio receiver by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier" title="Rectifier">rectifying</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation" title="Amplitude modulation">AM</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detector_(radio)" title="Detector (radio)">detector</a>, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_detector" title="Crystal detector">crystal detector</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleming_valve" title="Fleming valve">Fleming valve</a> used during the wireless telegraphy era. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency" title="Frequency">frequency</a> of repetition (spark rate) is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_frequency" title="Audio frequency">audio</a> range, typically 50 to 1000 sparks per second, so in a receiver's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earphone" title="Earphone">earphones</a> the signal sounds like a steady tone, whine, or buzz.<sup id="cite_ref-Kennedy_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-Kennedy-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>In order to transmit information with this signal, the operator turns the transmitter on and off rapidly by tapping on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch" title="Switch">switch</a> called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph_key" title="Telegraph key">telegraph key</a> in the primary circuit of the transformer, producing sequences of short (dot) and long (dash) strings of damped waves, to spell out messages in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" title="Morse code">Morse code</a>. As long as the key is pressed the spark gap fires repetitively, creating a string of pulses of radio waves, so in a receiver the keypress sounds like a buzz; the entire Morse code message sounds like a sequence of buzzes separated by pauses. In low-power transmitters the key directly breaks the primary circuit of the supply transformer, while in high-power transmitters the key operates a heavy duty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay" title="Relay">relay</a> that breaks the primary circuit.

<p>The circuit which charges the capacitors, along with the spark gap itself, determines the <i>spark rate</i> of the transmitter, the number of sparks and resulting damped wave pulses it produces per second, which determines the tone of the signal heard in the receiver. The spark rate should not be confused with the <i>frequency</i> of the transmitter, which is the number of sinusoidal oscillations per second in each damped wave. Since the transmitter produces one pulse of radio waves per spark, the output power of the transmitter was proportional to the spark rate, so higher rates were favored. Spark transmitters generally used one of three types of power circuits:<sup id="cite_ref-CodellaSparkRadio_10-6"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaSparkRadio-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Kennedy_11-2"><a href="#cite_note-Kennedy-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sarkar9_14-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sarkar9-14">[14]</a></sup>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_coil" title="Induction coil">induction coil</a> (Ruhmkorff coil) was used in low-power transmitters, usually less than 500 watts, often battery-powered.  An induction coil is a type of transformer powered by DC, in which a vibrating arm switch contact on the coil called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupter" title="Interrupter">interrupter</a> repeatedly breaks the circuit that provides current to the primary winding, causing the coil to generate pulses of high voltage. When the primary current to the coil is turned on, the primary winding creates a magnetic field in the iron core which pulls the springy interrupter arm away from its contact, opening the switch and cutting off the primary current. Then the magnetic field collapses, creating a pulse of high voltage in the secondary winding, and the interrupter arm springs back to close the contact again, and the cycle repeats. Each pulse of high voltage charged up the capacitor until the spark gap fired, resulting in one spark per pulse. Interrupters were limited to low spark rates of 20-100&nbsp;Hz, sounding like a low buzz in the receiver. In powerful induction coil transmitters, instead of a vibrating interrupter, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_coil#Mercury_and_electrolytic_interrupters" title="Induction coil">mercury turbine interrupter</a> was used. This could break the current at rates up to several thousand hertz, and the rate could be adjusted to produce the best tone.

<p>In higher power transmitters powered by AC, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer" title="Transformer">transformer</a> steps the input voltage up to the high voltage needed. The sinusoidal voltage from the transformer is applied directly to the capacitor, so the voltage on the capacitor varies from a high positive voltage, to zero, to a high negative voltage. The spark gap is adjusted so sparks only occur near the maximum voltage, at peaks of the AC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave" title="Sine wave">sine wave</a>, when the capacitor was fully charged. Since the AC sine wave has two peaks per cycle, ideally two sparks occurred during each cycle, so the spark rate was equal to twice the frequency of the AC power (often multiple sparks occurred during the peak of each half cycle). The spark rate of transmitters powered by 50 or 60&nbsp;Hz mains power was thus 100 or 120&nbsp;Hz. However higher audio frequencies cut through interference better, so in many transmitters the transformer was powered by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor-generator" title="Motor-generator">motor-alternator</a> set, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor" title="Electric motor">electric motor</a> with its shaft turning an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternator" title="Alternator">alternator</a>, that produced AC at a higher frequency, usually 500&nbsp;Hz, resulting in a spark rate of 1000&nbsp;Hz.

<p>In a transmitter with a "rotary" spark gap <i>(below)</i>, the capacitor was charged by AC from a high-voltage transformer as above, and discharged by a spark gap consisting of electrodes spaced around a wheel which was spun by an electric motor, which produced sparks as they passed by a stationary electrode.<sup id="cite_ref-CodellaSparkRadio_10-7"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaSparkRadio-10">[10]</a></sup> The spark rate was equal to the rotations per second times the number of spark electrodes on the wheel. It could produce spark rates up to several thousand hertz, and the rate could be adjusted by changing the speed of the motor. The rotation of the wheel was usually synchronized to the AC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave" title="Sine wave">sine wave</a> so the moving electrode passed by the stationary one at the peak of the sine wave, initiating the spark when the capacitor was fully charged, which produced a musical tone in the receiver.

<p>The invention of the radio transmitter resulted from the convergence of two lines of research.
</p><p>One was efforts by inventors to devise a system to transmit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph" title="Telegraph">telegraph</a> signals without wires. Experiments by a number of inventors had shown that electrical disturbances could be transmitted short distances through the air. However most of these systems worked not by radio waves but by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_induction" title="Electrostatic induction">electrostatic induction</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction" title="Electromagnetic induction">electromagnetic induction</a>, which had too short a range to be practical.<sup id="cite_ref-Nahin2_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-Nahin2-15">[15]</a></sup> In 1866 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahlon_Loomis" title="Mahlon Loomis">Mahlon Loomis</a> claimed to have transmitted an electrical signal through the atmosphere between two 600 foot wires held aloft by kites on mountaintops 14 miles apart.<sup id="cite_ref-Nahin2_15-1"><a href="#cite_note-Nahin2-15">[15]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a> had come close to discovering radio in 1875; he had generated and detected radio waves which he called "etheric currents" experimenting with high-voltage spark circuits, but due to lack of time did not pursue the matter.<sup id="cite_ref-Sarkar1_16-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sarkar1-16">[16]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Edward_Hughes" title="David Edward Hughes">David Edward Hughes</a> in 1879 had also stumbled on radio wave transmission which he received with his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_microphone" title="Carbon microphone">carbon microphone</a> detector, however he was persuaded that what he observed was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction" title="Electromagnetic induction">induction</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Sarkar1_16-1"><a href="#cite_note-Sarkar1-16">[16]</a></sup> Neither of these individuals are usually credited with the discovery of radio, because they did not understand the significance of their observations and did not publish their work before Hertz.
</p><p>The other was research by physicists to confirm the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism" title="Electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a> proposed in 1864 by Scottish physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="James Clerk Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a>, now called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations" title="Maxwell's equations">Maxwell's equations</a>. Maxwell's theory showed that a combination of oscillating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field" title="Electric field">electric</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic fields</a> could travel through space as an "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave" title="Electromagnetic wave">electromagnetic wave</a>". Maxwell proposed that light consisted of electromagnetic waves of short wavelength, but no one knew how to prove this, or generate or detect electromagnetic waves of other wavelengths. By 1883 it was known that accelerated electric charges could produce electromagnetic waves, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Fitzgerald" title="George Fitzgerald">George Fitzgerald</a> had calculated the output power of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_antenna" title="Loop antenna">loop antenna</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Fitzgerald1_17-0"><a href="#cite_note-Fitzgerald1-17">[17]</a></sup> Fitzgerald in a brief note published in 1883 suggested that electromagnetic waves could be generated practically by discharging a capacitor rapidly; the method used in spark transmitters,<sup id="cite_ref-Nahin3_18-0"><a href="#cite_note-Nahin3-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Fitzgerald2_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-Fitzgerald2-19">[19]</a></sup> however there is no indication that this inspired other inventors.

In 1892 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Crookes" title="William Crookes">William Crookes</a> had given an influential lecture<sup id="cite_ref-Crookes_66-0"><a href="#cite_note-Crookes-66">[66]</a></sup> on radio in which he suggested using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance" title="Resonance">resonance</a> (then called <i>syntony</i>) to reduce the bandwidth of transmitters and receivers.<sup id="cite_ref-Sarkar3_46-5"><a href="#cite_note-Sarkar3-46">[46]</a></sup> Using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_circuit" title="Resonant circuit">resonant circuit</a> (also called tuned circuit or tank circuit) in transmitters would narrow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing)" title="Bandwidth (signal processing)">bandwidth</a> of the radiated signal, it would occupy a smaller range of frequencies around its center frequency, so that the signals of transmitters "tuned" to transmit on different frequencies would no longer overlap. A receiver which had its own resonant circuit could receive a particular transmitter by "tuning" its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_frequency" title="Resonant frequency">resonant frequency</a> to the frequency of the desired transmitter, analogously to the way one musical instrument could be tuned to resonance with another.<sup id="cite_ref-Ashley2_64-1"><a href="#cite_note-Ashley2-64">[64]</a></sup> This is the system used in all modern radio.
</p><p>During 1897-1900 wireless researchers realized the advantages of "syntonic" or "tuned" systems, and added <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor" title="Capacitor">capacitors</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyden_jar" title="Leyden jar">Leyden jars</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor" title="Inductor">inductors</a> (coils of wire) to transmitters and receivers, to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_circuit" title="Resonant circuit">resonant circuits</a> (tuned circuits, or tank circuits).<sup id="cite_ref-Aitken1_67-0"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken1-67">[67]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Lodge" title="Oliver Lodge">Oliver Lodge</a>, who had been researching electrical resonance for years,<sup id="cite_ref-Aitken6_68-0"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken6-68">[68]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Thrower_52-3"><a href="#cite_note-Thrower-52">[52]</a></sup> patented the first "syntonic" transmitter and receiver in May 1897<sup id="cite_ref-Patent11575_63-1"><a href="#cite_note-Patent11575-63">[63]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Lodge1900_69-0"><a href="#cite_note-Lodge1900-69">[69]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Lee1_25-2"><a href="#cite_note-Lee1-25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Aitken2_70-0"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken2-70">[70]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hong5_58-2"><a href="#cite_note-Hong5-58">[58]</a></sup> Lodge added an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor" title="Inductor">inductor</a> (coil) between the sides of his dipole antennas, which resonated with the capacitance of the antenna to make a tuned circuit.<sup id="cite_ref-Thrower_52-4"><a href="#cite_note-Thrower-52">[52]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Aitken1_67-1"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken1-67">[67]</a></sup> Although his complicated circuit did not see much practical use, Lodge's "syntonic" patent was important because it was the first to propose a radio transmitter and receiver containing resonant circuits which were tuned to resonance with each other.<sup id="cite_ref-Thrower_52-5"><a href="#cite_note-Thrower-52">[52]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Aitken1_67-2"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken1-67">[67]</a></sup> In 1911 when the patent was renewed the Marconi Company was forced to buy it to protect its own syntonic system against infringement suits.<sup id="cite_ref-Aitken1_67-3"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken1-67">[67]</a></sup>
</p><p>The resonant circuit functioned analogously to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuning_fork" title="Tuning fork">tuning fork</a>, storing oscillating electrical energy, increasing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor" title="Q factor">Q factor</a> of the circuit so the oscillations were less damped.<sup id="cite_ref-Aitken1_67-4"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken1-67">[67]</a></sup> Another advantage was the frequency of the transmitter was no longer determined by the length of the antenna but by the resonant circuit, so it could easily be changed by adjustable taps on the coil. The antenna was brought into resonance with the tuned circuit using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loading_coil" title="Loading coil">loading coils</a>. The energy in each spark, and thus the power output, was no longer limited by the capacitance of the antenna but by the size of the capacitor in the resonant circuit.<sup id="cite_ref-Sarkar3_46-6"><a href="#cite_note-Sarkar3-46">[46]</a></sup> In order to increase the power very large capacitor banks were used. The form that the resonant circuit took in practical transmitters was the inductively-coupled circuit described in the next section.

<p>In developing these syntonic transmitters, researchers found it impossible to achieve low damping with a single resonant circuit. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_circuit" title="Resonant circuit">resonant circuit</a> can only have low damping (high Q, narrow bandwidth) if it is a "closed" circuit, with no energy dissipating components.<sup id="cite_ref-Marconi1_71-0"><a href="#cite_note-Marconi1-71">[71]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hong5_58-3"><a href="#cite_note-Hong5-58">[58]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Aitken6_68-1"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken6-68">[68]</a></sup> But such a circuit does not produce radio waves. A resonant circuit with an antenna radiating radio waves (an "open" tuned circuit) loses energy quickly, giving it high damping (low Q, wide bandwidth). There was a fundamental tradeoff between a circuit which produced persistent oscillations which had narrow bandwidth, and one which radiated high power.<sup id="cite_ref-CodellaSparkRadio_10-9"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaSparkRadio-10">[10]</a></sup>

<p>The inductively-coupled transmitter had a more complicated output waveform than the non-syntonic transmitter, due to the interaction of the two resonant circuits. The two magnetically coupled tuned circuits acted as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation" title="Oscillation">coupled oscillator</a>, producing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_frequency" title="Beat frequency">beats</a> <i>(see top graphs)</i>. The oscillating radio frequency energy was passed rapidly back and forth between the primary and secondary resonant circuits as long as the spark continued.<sup id="cite_ref-Leggett1_100-0"><a href="#cite_note-Leggett1-100">[100]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Beauchamp3_93-1"><a href="#cite_note-Beauchamp3-93">[93]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Huurdeman3_101-0"><a href="#cite_note-Huurdeman3-101">[101]</a></sup> Each time the energy returned to the primary, some was lost as heat in the spark.<sup id="cite_ref-Huurdeman3_101-1"><a href="#cite_note-Huurdeman3-101">[101]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Beauchamp3_93-2"><a href="#cite_note-Beauchamp3-93">[93]</a></sup> In addition, unless the coupling was very loose the oscillations caused the transmitter to transmit on two separate frequencies.<sup id="cite_ref-Beauchamp3_93-3"><a href="#cite_note-Beauchamp3-93">[93]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Burns2_102-0"><a href="#cite_note-Burns2-102">[102]</a></sup> Since the narrow passband of the receiver's resonant circuit could only be tuned to one of these frequencies, the power radiated at the other frequency was wasted.
</p><p>This troublesome backflow of energy to the primary circuit could be prevented by extinguishing (quenching) the spark at the right instant, after all the energy from the capacitors was transferred to the antenna circuit.<sup id="cite_ref-Leggett2_99-1"><a href="#cite_note-Leggett2-99">[99]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Burns2_102-1"><a href="#cite_note-Burns2-102">[102]</a></sup> Inventors tried various methods to accomplish this, such as air blasts and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elihu_Thomson" title="Elihu Thomson">Elihu Thomson</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_blowout" title="Magnetic blowout">magnetic blowout</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Beauchamp3_93-4"><a href="#cite_note-Beauchamp3-93">[93]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Burns2_102-2"><a href="#cite_note-Burns2-102">[102]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1906, a new type of spark gap was developed by German physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wien" title="Max Wien">Max Wien</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-Bard_103-0"><a href="#cite_note-Bard-103">[103]</a></sup> called the <i>series</i> or <i>quenched</i> gap.<sup id="cite_ref-Stanley1_104-0"><a href="#cite_note-Stanley1-104">[104]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Beauchamp2_105-0"><a href="#cite_note-Beauchamp2-105">[105]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Leggett3_106-0"><a href="#cite_note-Leggett3-106">[106]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Huurdeman3_101-2"><a href="#cite_note-Huurdeman3-101">[101]</a></sup> A quenched gap consisted of a stack of wide cylindrical electrodes separated by thin insulating spacer rings to create many narrow spark gaps in series,<sup id="cite_ref-Beauchamp2_105-1"><a href="#cite_note-Beauchamp2-105">[105]</a></sup> of around 0.1–0.3&nbsp;mm (0.004–0.01&nbsp;in).<sup id="cite_ref-Stanley1_104-1"><a href="#cite_note-Stanley1-104">[104]</a></sup> The wide surface area of the electrodes terminated the ionization in the gap quickly by cooling it after the current stopped. In the inductively coupled transmitter, the narrow gaps extinguished ("quenched") the spark at the first nodal point (<span>Q</span>) when the primary current momentarily went to zero after all the energy had been transferred to the secondary winding <i>(see lower graph)</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Leggett2_99-2"><a href="#cite_note-Leggett2-99">[99]</a></sup> Since without the spark no current could flow in the primary circuit, this effectively uncoupled the secondary from the primary circuit, allowing the secondary resonant circuit and antenna to oscillate completely free of the primary circuit after that (until the next spark). This produced output power centered on a single frequency instead of two frequencies. It also eliminated most of the energy loss in the spark, producing very lightly damped, long "ringing" waves, with decrements of only 0.08 to 0.25<sup id="cite_ref-Arco_107-0"><a href="#cite_note-Arco-107">[107]</a></sup> (a Q of 12-38) and consequently a very "pure", narrow bandwidth radio signal. Another advantage was the rapid quenching allowed the time between sparks to be reduced, allowing higher spark rates of around 1000 Hz to be used, which had a musical tone in the receiver which penetrated radio static better. The quenched gap transmitter was called the "singing spark" system.<sup id="cite_ref-Arco_107-1"><a href="#cite_note-Arco-107">[107]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Stanley1_104-2"><a href="#cite_note-Stanley1-104">[104]</a></sup>

</ul>
<p>There were two types of rotary spark transmitter:<sup id="cite_ref-Sarkar9_14-3"><a href="#cite_note-Sarkar9-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CodellaSparkRadio_10-14"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaSparkRadio-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Beauchamp3_93-7"><a href="#cite_note-Beauchamp3-93">[93]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Belrose_96-7"><a href="#cite_note-Belrose-96">[96]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul><li><i>Nonsynchronous</i>: In the earlier rotary gaps, the motor was not synchronized with the frequency of the AC transformer, so the spark occurred at random times in the AC cycle of the voltage applied to the capacitor. The problem with this was the interval between the sparks was not constant.<sup id="cite_ref-Sarkar9_14-4"><a href="#cite_note-Sarkar9-14">[14]</a></sup> The voltage on the capacitor when a moving electrode approached the stationary electrode varied randomly between zero and the peak AC voltage. The exact time when the spark started varied depending on the gap length the spark could jump, which depended on the voltage. The resulting random phase variation of successive damped waves resulted in a signal that had a "hissing" or "rasping" sound in the receiver.<sup id="cite_ref-Kennedy_11-4"><a href="#cite_note-Kennedy-11">[11]</a></sup></li>
<li><i>Synchronous</i>: In this type, invented by Fessenden around 1904, the rotor was turned by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_motor" title="Synchronous motor">synchronous motor</a> in synchronism with the cycles of the AC voltage to the transformer, so the spark occurred at the same points of the voltage sine wave each cycle. Usually it was designed so there was one spark each half cycle, adjusted so the spark occurred at the peak voltage when the capacitor was fully charged.<sup id="cite_ref-Kennedy_11-5"><a href="#cite_note-Kennedy-11">[11]</a></sup> Thus the spark had a steady frequency equal to a multiple of the AC line frequency, which created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_(music)" title="Harmonic (music)">harmonics</a> with the line frequency. The synchronous gap was said to produce a more musical, easily heard tone in the receiver, which cut through interference better.<sup id="cite_ref-Kennedy_11-6"><a href="#cite_note-Kennedy-11">[11]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>To reduce interference caused by the "noisy" signals of the burgeoning numbers of spark transmitters, the 1912 US Congress "Act to Regulate Radio Communication" required that "<i>the logarithmic decrement per oscillation in the wave trains emitted by the transmitter shall not exceed two tenths</i>"<sup id="cite_ref-Jansky1_57-3"><a href="#cite_note-Jansky1-57">[57]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CodellaSparkRadio_10-15"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaSparkRadio-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-RadioAct1912_110-0"><a href="#cite_note-RadioAct1912-110">[110]</a></sup> (this is equivalent to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor" title="Q factor">Q factor</a> of 15 or greater). Virtually the only spark transmitters which could satisfy this condition were the quenched-spark and rotary gap types above,<sup id="cite_ref-Jansky1_57-4"><a href="#cite_note-Jansky1-57">[57]</a></sup> and they dominated wireless telegraphy for the rest of the spark era.
</p>

<p>In 1912 in his high-power stations Marconi developed a refinement of the rotary discharger called the "timed spark" system, which generated what was probably the nearest to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave" title="Continuous wave">continuous wave</a> that sparks could produce.<sup id="cite_ref-Bucher2_111-0"><a href="#cite_note-Bucher2-111">[111]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Coursey_112-0"><a href="#cite_note-Coursey-112">[112]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sarkar8_113-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sarkar8-113">[113]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Goldsmith_114-0"><a href="#cite_note-Goldsmith-114">[114]</a></sup> He used several identical resonant circuits in parallel, with the capacitors charged by a DC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo" title="Dynamo">dynamo</a>. These were discharged sequentially by multiple rotary discharger wheels on the same shaft to create overlapping damped waves shifted progressively in time, which were added together in the oscillation transformer so the output was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle" title="Superposition principle">superposition</a> of damped waves. The speed of the discharger wheel was controlled so that the time between sparks was equal to an integer multiple of the wave period. Therefore oscillations of the successive wave trains were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_phase" title="In phase">in phase</a> and reinforced each other. The result was essentially a continuous sinusoidal wave, whose amplitude varied with a ripple at the spark rate. This system was necessary to give Marconi's transoceanic stations a narrow enough bandwidth that they didn't interfere with other transmitters on the narrow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low_frequency" title="Very low frequency">VLF</a> band. Timed spark transmitters achieved the longest transmission range of any spark transmitters, but these behemoths represented the end of spark technology.

<p>Spark transmitters and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_radio" title="Crystal radio">crystal receivers</a> used to receive them were simple enough that they were widely built by hobbyists. During the first decades of the 20th century this exciting new high tech hobby attracted a growing community of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_amateur" title="Radio amateur">radio amateurs</a>", many of them teenage boys, who used their homebuilt sets recreationally to contact distant amateurs and chat with them by Morse code, and relay messages.<sup id="cite_ref-CodellaSqueakBox_119-0"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaSqueakBox-119">[119]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-White2_120-0"><a href="#cite_note-White2-120">[120]</a></sup> Low-power amateur transmitters ("squeak boxes") were often built with "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trembler_coil" title="Trembler coil">trembler</a>" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_coil" title="Ignition coil">ignition coils</a> from early automobiles such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T" title="Ford Model T">Ford Model T</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-CodellaSqueakBox_119-1"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaSqueakBox-119">[119]</a></sup> In the US prior to 1912 there was no government regulation of radio, and a chaotic "wild west" atmosphere prevailed, with stations transmitting without regard to other stations on their frequency, and deliberately interfering with each other.<sup id="cite_ref-Howeth2_121-0"><a href="#cite_note-Howeth2-121">[121]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CodellaFirstRegulation_122-0"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaFirstRegulation-122">[122]</a></sup> The expanding numbers of non-syntonic broadband spark transmitters created uncontrolled congestion in the airwaves, interfering with commercial and military wireless stations.<sup id="cite_ref-CodellaFirstRegulation_122-1"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaFirstRegulation-122">[122]</a></sup>
</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic" title="RMS Titanic">RMS <i>Titanic</i></a> sinking 14 April 1912 increased public appreciation for the role of radio, but the loss of life brought attention to the disorganized state of the new radio industry, and prompted regulation which corrected some abuses.<sup id="cite_ref-White2_120-1"><a href="#cite_note-White2-120">[120]</a></sup> Although the <i>Titanic</i> radio operator's <i>CQD</i> distress calls summoned ships which rescued 705 survivors, the rescue operation was delayed four hours because the nearest ship, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Californian" title="SS Californian">SS <i>Californian</i></a>, only a few miles away, did not hear the <i>Titanic'</i>s call as its radio operator had gone to bed. This was held responsible for most of the 1500 deaths.  Existing international regulations required all ships with more than 50 passengers to carry wireless equipment, but after the disaster subsequent regulations mandated ships have enough radio officers so that a round-the-clock radio watch could be kept. In the US 1912 Radio Act, licenses were required for all radio transmitters, maximum damping of transmitters was limited to a decrement of 0.2 to get old noisy non-syntonic transmitters off the air, and amateurs were mainly restricted to the unused frequencies above 1.5&nbsp;MHz.<sup id="cite_ref-RadioAct1912_110-1"><a href="#cite_note-RadioAct1912-110">[110]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CodellaFirstRegulation_122-2"><a href="#cite_note-CodellaFirstRegulation-122">[122]</a></sup>

To achieve a maximum range of around 3000 - 6000 miles, transoceanic stations transmitted mainly in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low_frequency" title="Very low frequency">very low frequency</a> (VLF) band, from 50&nbsp;kHz to as low as 15 - 20&nbsp;kHz. At these wavelengths even the largest antennas were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrically_short" title="Electrically short">electrically short</a>, a tiny fraction of a wavelength tall, and so had low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_resistance" title="Radiation resistance">radiation resistance</a> (often below 1 ohm), so these transmitters required enormous wire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_antenna" title="Umbrella antenna">umbrella</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-antenna" title="T-antenna">flattop</a> antennas up to several miles long with large capacitive toploads, to achieve adequate efficiency. The antenna required a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loading_coil" title="Loading coil">loading coil</a> at the base, 6 - 10 feet tall, to make it resonant with the transmitter.
</p><p>The spark gap oscillator was also used in nonradio applications, continuing long after it became obsolete in radio.

<p>Although their damping had been reduced as much as possible, spark transmitters still produced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damped_wave" title="Damped wave">damped waves</a>, which due to their large bandwidth caused interference between transmitters.<sup id="cite_ref-Terman_4-2"><a href="#cite_note-Terman-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Aitken5_59-1"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken5-59">[59]</a></sup> The spark also made a very loud noise when operating, produced corrosive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone" title="Ozone">ozone</a> gas, eroded the spark electrodes, and could be a fire hazard. Despite its drawbacks, most wireless experts believed along with Marconi that the impulsive "whipcrack" of a spark was necessary to produce radio waves that would communicate long distances.
</p><p>From the beginning, physicists knew that another type of waveform, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave" title="Continuous wave">continuous</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusoidal" title="Sinusoidal">sinusoidal</a> waves (CW), had theoretical advantages over damped waves for radio transmission.<sup id="cite_ref-Fitzgerald_131-0"><a href="#cite_note-Fitzgerald-131">[131]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Aitken4_54-2"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken4-54">[54]</a></sup> Because their energy is essentially concentrated at a single frequency, in addition to causing almost no interference to other transmitters on adjacent frequencies, continuous wave transmitters could transmit longer distances with a given output power.<sup id="cite_ref-Aitken5_59-2"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken5-59">[59]</a></sup> They could also be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation" title="Modulation">modulated</a> with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal" title="Audio signal">audio signal</a> to carry sound.<sup id="cite_ref-Aitken5_59-3"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken5-59">[59]</a></sup> The problem was no techniques were known for generating them. The efforts described above to reduce the damping of spark transmitters can be seen as attempts to make their output approach closer to the ideal of a continuous wave, but spark transmitters could not produce true continuous waves.<sup id="cite_ref-Aitken4_54-3"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken4-54">[54]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Beginning about 1904, continuous wave transmitters were developed using new principles, which competed with spark transmitters. Continuous waves were first generated by two short-lived technologies:<sup id="cite_ref-Aitken5_59-4"><a href="#cite_note-Aitken5-59">[59]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_converter" title="Arc converter">arc converter</a> (Poulsen arc) transmitter, invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdemar_Poulsen" title="Valdemar Poulsen">Valdemar Poulsen</a> in 1904 used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_resistance" title="Negative resistance">negative resistance</a> of a continuous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc" title="Electric arc">electric arc</a> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> atmosphere to excite oscillations in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_circuit" title="Resonant circuit">resonant circuit</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexanderson_alternator" title="Alexanderson alternator">Alexanderson alternator</a> transmitter, developed between 1906 and 1915 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Fessenden" title="Reginald Fessenden">Reginald Fessenden</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Alexanderson" title="Ernst Alexanderson">Ernst Alexanderson</a>, was a huge rotating alternating current generator (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternator" title="Alternator">alternator</a>) driven by an electric motor at a high enough speed that it produced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency" title="Radio frequency">radio frequency</a> current in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low_frequency" title="Very low frequency">very low frequency</a> range.</li></ul>
<p>These transmitters, which could produce power outputs of up to one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megawatt" title="Megawatt">megawatt</a>, slowly replaced the spark transmitter in high-power radiotelegraphy stations. However spark transmitters remained popular in two way communication stations because most continuous wave transmitters were not capable of a mode called "break in" or "listen in" operation.  With a spark transmitter, when the telegraph key was up between Morse symbols the carrier wave was turned off and the receiver was turned on, so the operator could listen for an incoming message. This allowed the receiving station, or a third station, to interrupt or "break in" to an ongoing transmission.  In contrast, these early CW transmitters had to operate continuously; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_wave" title="Carrier wave">carrier wave</a> was not turned off between Morse code symbols, words, or sentences but just detuned, so a local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_receiver" title="Radio receiver">receiver</a> could not operate as long as the transmitter was powered up. Therefore these stations could not receive messages until the transmitter was turned off.

Due to the development of the first high-power transmitting tubes by the end of World War 1, in the 1920s tube transmitters replaced the arc converter and alternator transmitters, as well as the last of the old noisy spark transmitters.
</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Radiotelegraph_Convention_(1912)" title="International Radiotelegraph Convention (1912)">1927 International Radiotelegraph Convention</a> in Washington, D.C. saw a battle to finally eliminate spark radio.<sup id="cite_ref-Schroeder_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-Schroeder-6">[6]</a></sup> Spark transmitters were long obsolete at this point, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_broadcasting" title="Radio broadcasting">broadcast radio</a> audiences and radio authorities were complaining of the disruption to radio reception that noisy legacy marine spark transmitters were causing. But shipping interests vigorously fought a blanket prohibition on damped waves, due to the capital expenditure that would be required to replace ancient spark equipment that was still being used on older ships. The Convention prohibited licensing of new land spark transmitters after 1929.<sup id="cite_ref-Howeth3_132-0"><a href="#cite_note-Howeth3-132">[132]</a></sup> Damped wave radio emission, called Class B, was banned after 1934 except for emergency use on ships.<sup id="cite_ref-FCC_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-FCC-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Howeth3_132-1"><a href="#cite_note-Howeth3-132">[132]</a></sup> This loophole allowed shipowners to avoid replacing spark transmitters, which were kept as emergency backup transmitters on ships through World War 2.
</p><p>One legacy of spark-gap transmitters is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_operator" title="Radio operator">radio operators</a> were regularly nicknamed "Sparky" long after the devices ceased to be used. Even today, the German verb <i>funken</i>, literally, "to spark", also means "to send a radio message". In the 1950s a Japanese toy company, Matsudaya, produced a line of cheap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_control" title="Remote control">remote control</a> toy trucks, boats and robots called Radicon, which used a low-power spark transmitter in the controller as an inexpensive way to produce the radio control signals.<sup id="cite_ref-Parker_133-0"><a href="#cite_note-Parker-133">[133]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Findlay_134-0"><a href="#cite_note-Findlay-134">[134]</a></sup> The signals were received in the toy by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherer" title="Coherer">coherer</a> receiver.
</p><p>Spark gap oscillators are still used to generate high-frequency high voltage needed to initiate welding arcs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_tungsten_arc_welding" title="Gas tungsten arc welding">gas tungsten arc welding</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-LincolnElectric_135-0"><a href="#cite_note-LincolnElectric-135">[135]</a></sup> Powerful spark gap pulse generators are still used to simulate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse" title="Electromagnetic pulse">EMPs</a>.

<li id="cite_note-Fitzgerald-131"><span><b><a href="#cite_ref-Fitzgerald_131-0" aria-label="Jump up" title="Jump up">^</a></b></span> <span>George Fitzgerald as early as 1892 described a spark oscillator as similar to the oscillations produced when a cork pops out of a winebottle, and said what was needed was a continuous electromagnetic "whistle".  He realized that if the resistance of a tuned circuit were made zero or negative it would produce continuous oscillations, and tried to make an electronic oscillator by exciting a tuned circuit with negative resistance from a dynamo, what would today be called a parametric oscillator, but was unsuccessful.  G. Fitzgerald, <i>On the Driving of Electromagnetic Vibrations by Electromagnetic and Electrostatic Engines</i>, read at the January 22, 1892 meeting of the Physical Society of London, in <cite>Larmor, Joseph, Ed.
