We appreciate you volunteering your time to help keep gamedev.world an international gathering for productive exchange, built on curiosity and respect.<p>Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the safe space policy we will be relying on you to enforce:<br><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bit.ly/2Jffsaq&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1581388694180000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFe08arCSn98vTZXR5kViKzP0z3Ew">https://bit.ly/2Jffsaq</a></p><p>Your responsibility is to keep chat polite, flagging hate speech and removing bad-faith actors at your discretion (in line with the safe space policy). You will also keep track of interesting questions from chat, translating your top 5 into English and inputting them using our custom tool to be displayed for the speaker's selection. Supplementary moderation training will be provided by email, and you should keep an eye on the informed email address to go through the training as soon as it is made available.</p><p>gamedev.world will be a continuous stream starting at 11AM GMT on June 21st, and moderation is required for the first ~27 hours after that. Any time you can help us during those days will be more than welcome and appreciated! (:</p></div></div></div></div>
