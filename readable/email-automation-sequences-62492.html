<p>I have written about <a href="https://jay.kanakiya.in/blog/personalized-images-in-emails/">personalized emails</a> before, but never really covered about the state of email automation. Companies of all states and sizes send automated emails that get triggered when you complete an action on their website or app. User signups forgot passwords, abandoned carts, shop purchases, deals of the week, newsletters, rights issues, account statements, social media updates – every app or website will utilize email automation to a large degree.</p>



<blockquote><p>Email Automation Sequences are complex workflows that trigger personalized emails to customers based upon triggers and conditions </p></blockquote>



<p>Just recall a recent service that you have been using and how many emails you receive from them. Be it a simple webinar that you have signed up for.  The sequence will look like the below </p>



<ol><li>Welcome email after when you register </li><li>Reminder email before a day </li><li>Reminder email before an hour </li><li>The webinar is currently ongoing –  </li><li>If you did not attend, join our next webinar</li><li>If you did attend, an upsell or a survey about their product</li><li>After 3 months, we have another webinar for you</li></ol>



<p>7 Emails just for a 1-hour webinar. Why? Because people engage with it. It’s your primary identity bigger than any of your social media handles. Now similarly, recall when you sign up for a service or complete a product purchase – at the backend multiple email sequences are always running – pushing you to the next step, reminding you to take action, informing you about their new product and service</p>



<p>Just how complex are these email sequences ?</p>

<blockquote><p>Email continues to be the most direct way to reach customers, not Facebook, not Instagram, and not Twitter. </p></blockquote>



<p>Which is why there are hundreds of email automation service providers catering to companies of all shapes and sizes. If you are looking out for more templates for motivation,  just visit <a href="https://www.autopilothq.com/templates">Autopilot HQ</a> – you have email automation sequences for SaaS, subscribers, follow-up emails, split AB email tests – close to 155 different types of email automation sequences available. </p>







<p>The importance of having a drip campaign is well known to all marketers – even if the first cold email does not work, the second one might or the third one after 2 months will definitely work. If your KPI involves increasing customer signups and reducing churn, check out the below automated examples </p>

<p><strong>How to start incorporating in your website?</strong></p>



<p>The plethora of options available for email automation sequences is bound to confuse newcomers and experienced professionals alike. That is why I have a written a quick guide to choose the best option based on your requirement </p>



<ol><li><strong>eCommerce on Shopify, Woocommerce, Bigcommerce, etc – &lt; 10K customers</strong><p>Do not try to go for fancy alternatives, just look at their respective app stores, and choose the most popular email platform app available. It will save you tons of time and resources with access to ready-made templates.</p></li><li><strong>Blogging – WordPress </strong><p>Sendpress, Mailpoet, and Mailchimp remain the best options available. If you are creating a paid newsletter publication, take a look at Substack which will fulfill all your requirements quickly.</p></li><li><strong>Bootstrapped SaaS Firm &lt; 50K emails a month</strong><p>This remains the most competitive category as companies want to lockin the company with the pricing usually per customer. Some of the available options get expensive quickly once you get outside their free tier but if you are a new company, it’s just simpler to rent rather than build. <br>Autopilot, Omnisend, Intercom, Mailchimp, Hubspot, Campaign Monitor are just few of the companies competing for this space. My favorite option would be Intercom due to integrated chat and email to quickly resolve customer queries. But for complex user onboarding, I would prefer Autopilot. Be prepared to shell out close to $150/month for an email platform at this size with integrations for SMS, Chat and CRM. </p></li><li><strong> SaaS Firm &lt; 2M emails a month</strong><p>At this stage, you will be probably spending hundreds of dollars on your email campaigns. Depending upon your ROI you might be looking for some cheaper options to cut costs. See no further than Amazon SES – 2.5 lakh reliable emails at less $50/month. But you might have to manually set up email sequences and code API for the same which is time-consuming.  <br><a href="https://sendy.co/">Sendy</a> (one time fee of $59) + Amazon SES – becomes your most preferred option now. Check out this <a href="https://popupsmart.com/blog/amazon-ses-guide-for-email-marketing">blog post</a> for more options</p></li><li><strong>Self-hosted Newsletters </strong><p>If you have huge email lists &gt; 1M subscribers and are planning to go for mass email campaigns, then <a href="https://github.com/MoonMail/MoonMail/">Amazon SES + Moonmail</a> remains the best option for you to get started. $5/month and $1/10K emails is a great way to start your email campaigns</p></li><li><strong>Enterprise Firms</strong><p>Marketo, Pardot and Adobe Campaign – Large firms who are looking for dozens of customizations, run multiple campaings and have a team of marketers  </p></li></ol>
