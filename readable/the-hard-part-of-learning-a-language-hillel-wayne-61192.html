  <p>I want to do $THING. Normally I do my hacking in Python, which is <em>okay</em> but has lots of frustrations. My friends tell me $LANGUAGE is better for doing $THING. After going through the online tutorial, I can see why. Maybe I’ll try $LANGUAGE for this project! Just a few things I need to figure out first:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I install it? The docs say <code>brew install</code>, but I’m on Windows.

<ul>
<li>Do I have to use WSL?</li>
<li>Why is it breaking on WSL?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How am I supposed to be writing this? Do I download an IDE? Is there a Vim plugin? Is this ostensibly editor-agnostic but <em>really</em> supposed to use Emacs?

<ul>
<li>Uh oh, there’s two <em>competing</em> plugins. The communities hate each other. Which do I choose?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do I read from a file? How do I parse JSON? How do I pull environment variables?

<ul>
<li>How do I do any of the things that aren’t part of the core syntax/semantics but are super common problems people face every day?</li>
<li>I’m going to have to memorize another 100 functions and their parameters, aren’t I?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are the language quirks that will cost me an hour to discover?

<ul>
<li>What are the footguns that will cost me a day to debug?</li>
<li>What are the things that are <em>just</em> different enough from what I’m used to that will confuse me? What will trip me up every time I switch back to a different language?</li>
<li>What parts of the core language should I avoid at all costs?</li>
<li>What are the snippets that <em>look</em> right but are secretly wrong?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How is the help organized? Is there an official site? How’s the site laid out?

<ul>
<li>Is it actually useful or will it make me want to smash all computers?</li>
<li>Does it have documentation for people <em>besides</em> “complete newbies” and “language maintainers”?</li>
<li>Can I download the official docs, or will I have to be online to read any of the references?</li>
<li><em>Are</em> there official docs?</li>
<li>Oh wait, I’m supposed to learn from $BOOK, which is only available in physical form.</li>
<li>And people keep telling me that $AUTHOR is a serial killer?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I hit problem X. Should I look for  help in the official docs, or the FAQ, or the community, or should I be putting random stuff into Google?

<ul>
<li>Oh, looks like someone answered this in 2007! Which was eight versions ago. Are they still right or is their advice obsolete?</li>
<li>I found something from 2011 that said the 2007 person was wrong. Do I do what 2011 dude says or should I assume his advice is <em>also</em> obsolete?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do I debug? Will doing anything other than “break into repl” be like pulling teeth?

<ul>
<li>Will “break into repl” be like pulling teeth?</li>
<li>Is this one of those communities which think debuggers are for n00bs and you should write a lot of print statements?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Testing. Is unit testing part of the core library, or do I need to install a third party framework?

<ul>
<li>Or both? Like how Python comes with <code>unittest</code>, but everybody uses <code>pytest</code>.</li>
<li>Or how Ruby has <code>Minitest</code>, <code>rspec</code>, <em>and</em> <code>Test::Unit</code>, and people get into fights about which is best.

<ul>
<li>Apparently I’m supposed to learn Cucumber?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What about property-based testing? Does $LANGUAGE even <em>have</em> a PBT library?</li>
<li>How does the test runner work? How long should I try to integrate it with my dev environment before giving up and running it in a separate terminal?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do I build? How do I package? How do I manage my environment?

<ul>
<li>What are all the command flags I <em>should</em> be using that aren’t default for various reasons?</li>
<li>How am I supposed to “properly” organize my project files?</li>
<li>I organized everything properly, how come it’s still not finding my module?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Package management.

<ul>
<li>How do I find the packages I need? If there are multiple competing packages, how do I decide which one I should use?</li>
<li>And now I have to learn the APIs of the third-party packages.</li>
<li>And the API of the package manager itself.</li>
<li>What are the “canonical” packages the community has consensus on? Am I going to have to dive into the community to find out what I need to install?</li>
<li>I do?</li>
<li>Oh <em>great</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So… the language community.

<ul>
<li>Where are they? Will I have to join Yet Another Slack? Install Yet Another Messaging App? Do I have to set up a dedicated machine just to keep connected to an IRC channel?</li>
<li>Are they friendly to beginners, hostile, passive-aggressive?</li>
<li>Are there any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair">missing stairs</a> or known abusers?</li>
<li>Are there high-profile rivalries?</li>
<li>What innocuous-seeming topics always turn into a flamewar? Is my question even safe to ask?</li>
<li>Now they’re explaining something way above my head. Is this necessary to get, or are they just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge">cursed with knowledge</a>?</li>
<li>What opinions do they have on <em>other</em> programming languages? Are they going to look down on me for writing a lot of Python?</li>
<li>Do they think I’m subhuman scum for using Windows?</li>
<li>What are all these in-jokes supposed to be?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Screw this, I’m going back to Python.</p>
