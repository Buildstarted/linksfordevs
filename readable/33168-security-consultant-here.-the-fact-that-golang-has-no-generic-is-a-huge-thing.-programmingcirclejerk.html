But the sweet embrace will soon turn into a chokehold.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The cacaphony of Generics must never take hold of our language. It is much more secure to explicitly write each data structure for the type we desire. Copy and paste bugs are a boogeyman, told to impressionable children.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We are not children, but men, and we shall walk tall towards the simple, almost naive but warming light that is a Go without Generics.</p></div></div></div></div>
