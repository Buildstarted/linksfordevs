    <p>IoC containers like <a href="https://autofac.org/">Autofac</a> are magic when they quietly do their job; but, when they don‚Äôt behave as intended, they can be maddeningly opaque.</p>

<p><em>Autofac.Analysis</em> is the latest incarnation of a project I‚Äôve had in the works for a long, long time. Its primary purpose is to <em>reliably</em> detect Autofac usage problems <em>at runtime</em>: notably, it can spot the dreaded <code>IDisposable</code> component ‚Äúmemory leak‚Äù bug that still trips up people who are new to how Autofac works.</p>

<p>Along with that, <em>Autofac.Analysis</em> offers a glimpse into the hidden life of the IoC container running at the core of your app. What‚Äôs that thing actually doing in there? Find out:</p>

<h3 id="1-install-the-autofacanalysis-module">1. Install the <em>Autofac.Analysis</em> module</h3>

<p>On the application side, you need to hook <em>Autofac.Analysis</em> into your <code>ContainerBuilder</code>, and give it somewhere to send events. The analyzer doesn‚Äôt have a UI, but instead writes events through a <a href="https://serilog.net/">Serilog</a> logger.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll start by installing a package or two:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>dotnet add package Autofac.Analysis
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.Seq
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Even if you‚Äôre using Serilog in the rest of your application, you might want to set up a separate logging pipeline for this, because a little bit of nonstandard configuration is needed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// using Serilog;
var logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .Destructure.ToMaximumDepth(100)
    .WriteTo.Seq("http://localhost:5341")
    .CreateLogger();
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>Destructure.ToMaximumDepth(100)</code> lets us log some deeper object graphs than might normally be sensible :-)</p>

<p>Slicing and dicing the events is made easier by a structure log server like <a href="https://datalust.co/seq">Seq</a> - you can just as easily log them to a JSON file or some other log server if you like.</p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt have Seq running locally, it‚Äôs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker run --rm -it -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y -p 5341:80 datalust/seq
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>‚Ä¶ and open a web browser on http://localhost:5341.</p>

<p>Next, register the module with the <code>ContainerBuilder</code> you use to configure Autofac:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// using Autofac;
// using Autofac.Analysis;
var builder = new ContainerBuilder();

#if DEBUG
builder.RegisterModule(new AnalysisModule(logger));
#endif

// Other registrations...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I‚Äôve added some <code>#if DEBUG</code> conditional compilation directives just to remind you that you probably <em>don‚Äôt</em> want to run this day-to-day in production: it‚Äôs very likely it will have a detrimental effect on application performance.</p>

<h3 id="2-run-your-application">2. Run your application!</h3>

<p>Here‚Äôs the fun part! Start up your app, click around, test things out. The goal is to exercise as much code as you can, since this will trigger <code>Resolve()</code> calls and feed events to the analyzer.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nblumhardt/autofac-analysis/tree/dev/sample/MvcApplication">The sample app</a> is just an ASP.NET Core MVC <em>File &gt; New Project</em> web app with some dummy components thrown in. <code>HomeController.Index()</code> secretly sneaks a hundred tubes of toothpaste into the visitor‚Äôs shopping cart:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>HomeController</span> <span>:</span> <span>Controller</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>readonly</span> <span>ShoppingCartService</span> <span>_shoppingCartService</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>HomeController</span><span>(</span><span>ShoppingCartService</span> <span>shoppingCartService</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>_shoppingCartService</span> <span>=</span> <span>shoppingCartService</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>IActionResult</span> <span>Index</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>_shoppingCartService</span><span>.</span><span>AddItem</span><span>(</span><span>"toothpaste"</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>);</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>View</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It otherwise looks like the default ASP.NET Core app template.</p>

<h3 id="3-dig-through-the-analysis">3. Dig through the analysis</h3>

<p>Here‚Äôs the ‚Ä¶ slightly less-fun part. If you refresh the Seq UI in your browser you should now see a pile of events:</p>

<p><img src="https://nblumhardt.com/img/2019-03-autofac-analysis/AnalysisView.png" alt="Analysis Log"></p>

<p>If you want to find information about a specific component, you can search for it by type name, but otherwise, select the <em>Warnings</em> and <em>Errors</em> signals in the right-hand bar to see whether the analyzer has picked up anything interesting.</p>

<p><img src="https://nblumhardt.com/img/2019-03-autofac-analysis/WarningEvents.png" alt="Warning Events"></p>

<p>The analysis is fairly loose, and there are sure to be some false-positives. The most important event to look out for is <code>A004</code>, which I‚Äôve expanded in the screenshot. This indicates a potential leak. If you find one, you can switch back to your application and run through the same sequence of actions, again. Does another, similar message, appear in the analysis log? If so - you‚Äôre probably onto something.</p>

<p>From the warning event, clicking the green checkmark next to the <code>ComponentId</code> property and selecting <em>Find</em> will give you more information about the component, and <code>ResolveOperationId</code> will give you more information about the graph being resolved, including where the <code>Resolve()</code> call originated and what components contributed to it. <strong>Don‚Äôt forget</strong> to de-select the <em>Warnings</em> and <em>Errors</em> signals, so that you can see information-level events.</p>

<p><img src="https://nblumhardt.com/img/2019-03-autofac-analysis/ResolveOperation.png" alt="Resolve Operation"></p>

<p>Here I‚Äôve filtered on the <code>ResolveOperationId</code> to see where in the codebase it started. Here‚Äôs the <code>ShoppingCartService.AddItem()</code> method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>ShoppingCartService</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>readonly</span> <span>Func</span><span>&lt;</span><span>DBContext</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>_createDBContext</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>ShoppingCartService</span><span>(</span><span>Func</span><span>&lt;</span><span>DBContext</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>createDBContext</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>_createDBContext</span> <span>=</span> <span>createDBContext</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>AddItem</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> <span>itemId</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>quantity</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>Log</span><span>.</span><span>ForContext</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ShoppingCartService</span><span>&gt;().</span><span>Information</span><span>(</span><span>"Adding {ItemId} x {Quantity} to cart"</span><span>,</span> <span>itemId</span><span>,</span> <span>quantity</span><span>);</span>

        <span>// Oops, this will leak, we really needed Func&lt;Owned&lt;DBContext&gt;&gt; here.</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> <span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>_createDBContext</span><span>())</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>// Find and update the current shopping cart :-)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Classic mistake - using <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> where <code>Func&lt;Owned&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> is required.</p>

<h3 id="4-getting-help">4. Getting help</h3>

<p>It might be a few years old, now, but if you have problems with memory usage in Autofac, <a href="https://nblumhardt.com/2011/01/an-autofac-lifetime-primer/">the primer</a> is the place to start.</p>

<p><em>Autofac.Analysis</em> is a bit of an experiment. While issue reports and PRs for the analysis engine are welcome, I can‚Äôt help with debugging any Autofac usage issues that it identifies, sorry. Don‚Äôt despair, though! You should be able to collect enough information from the analysis log to write a really detailed Stack Overflow post, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/autofac">tagging it with <code>autofac</code></a> is usually sufficient to get the right eyes on it.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p><strong>Aside‚Ä¶ why is the code so badly overengineered?</strong> If you poke your head into the <a href="https://github.com/nblumhardt/autofac-analysis"><code>nblumhardt/autofac-analysis</code></a> GitHub repository, you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs a complex beast. The analyzer was originally <a href="https://github.com/nblumhardt/whitebox">a fully-out-of-process application</a>, complete with a WPF user interface, that connected to the profiled app via named pipes (I‚Äôd hoped to package it as a Visual Studio plug-in at some point). The effort involved in building and maintaining it ended up too great, so the code was cut down to what we have today. There‚Äôs still a full ‚Äúclient side‚Äù object model that replicates what‚Äôs going on in the container, and a ‚Äútransport‚Äù that connects the model asynchronously to container events. It‚Äôs true that I‚Äôd never go this far, starting from scratch with more modest goals, but there are some nice properties of this architecture, including resilience to accidental deadlocks, that makes it worth keeping around as a foundation for more complex analysis someday.</p>
