<p>In this post I show 5 different ways to change which URLs your app listens on. We’ll look at each of these options in more detail below.</p>

<p>In this post I show one way to resolve the problem by randomising the ports ASP.NET Core uses when it starts the application. I’ll also show how you can work out which port the application has selected from inside your app.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dotnet/tye" target="_blank">Tye</a>&nbsp;helps .NET Core developers build applications that are a collection of services and containers. On your local machine, Tye runs your .NET services, any containers you need, and a dashboard you can use to inspect this environment. Tye can then deploy your services and containers to your Kubernetes cluster.</p>

But that didn’t deter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/philbe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Philip Bernstein</a>, now a Distinguished Scientist in MSR’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-management-exploration-and-mining-dmx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Management, Exploration and Mining group</a>, and a pioneer in the field.</p>
