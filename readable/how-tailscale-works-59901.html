<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>People often ask us for an overview of how Tailscale works. We’ve been
putting off answering that, because we kept changing it!
But now things have started to settle down.</p>
<p>Let’s go through the entire Tailscale system from bottom to top, the same
way we built it (but skipping some zigzags we took along the way). With this
information, you should be able to build your own Tailscale replacement…
except you don’t have to, since our <a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">node software is open
source</a> and we have a <a href="https://tailscale.com/pricing/">flexible free
plan</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-data-plane-wireguard">The data plane: WireGuard®</h3>
<p>Our base layer is the increasingly popular and excellent open source
<a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">WireGuard</a> package (specifically the userspace
Go variant, <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">wireguard-go</a>).
WireGuard creates a set of extremely lightweight encrypted tunnels between
your computer, VM, or container (which WireGuard calls an “endpoint” and
we’ll call a “node”), and any other nodes in your network.</p>
<p>Let’s clarify that: most of the time, VPN users, including WireGuard users,
build a “hub and spoke” architecture, where each client device (say, your
laptop) connects to a central “concentrator” or VPN gateway.</p>
<h4 id="hub-and-spoke-networks">Hub-and-spoke networks</h4>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/hub-and-spoke-single.svg" alt="A central hub-and-spoke subnet router, connecting 10 client nodes and 3 servers.">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>
        Figure 1. A traditional hub-and-spoke VPN.
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>This is the easiest way to set up WireGuard, because each node in the network
needs to know the public key, public IP address, and port number of each
other node it wants to connect directly to. If you wanted to fully connect
10 nodes, then that would be 9 peer nodes that each node has to know about,
or 90 separate tunnels. In a hub-and-spoke, you just have one central hub
node and 9 outliers (with “spokes” connecting them), which is much simpler.
The hub node usually has a static IP address and a hole poked in its
firewall so it’s easy for everyone to find. Then it can accept incoming
connections from nodes at other IP addresses, even if those nodes are
themselves behind a firewall, in the usual way that client-server Internet
protocols do.</p>
<p>Hub-and-spoke works well, but it has some downsides. First of all, most
modern companies don’t have a single place they want to designate as a hub.
They have multiple offices, multiple cloud datacenters or regions or
VPCs, and so on. In traditional VPN setups, companies configure a single VPN
concentrator, and then set up secondary tunnels
(often using IPsec) between locations. So remote users arrive at the VPN
concentrator in one place, then have their traffic forwarded to its final
destination in another place.</p>
<p>This traditional setup can be hard to scale. First of all, remote users
might or might not be close to the VPN concentrator; if they’re far away,
then they incur high latency connecting to it. Secondly, the datacenter they
want to reach might not be close to the VPN concentrator either; if it’s far
away, they incur high latency again. Imagine this case, with a worker in New
York trying to reach a server in New York, through the company’s VPN
concentrator or BeyondCorp proxy at their head office in San Francisco, not
that I’m bitter:</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/hub-and-spoke-multiple.svg" alt="A user in NYC, connecting to an SF-based VPN gateway to access a NY datacenter.">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>
        Figure 2(a). Inefficient routing through a traditional VPN concentrator.
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Luckily, WireGuard is different. Remember how we said it creates a “set of
extremely lightweight tunnels” above? The tunnels are light enough that we
can create a multi-hub setup without too much trouble:</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/hub-and-spoke-direct.svg" alt="The same five datacenters, but the NYC user is connected directly to all five datacenters.">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>
        Figure 2(b). A WireGuard multipoint VPN routes traffic more efficiently.
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The only catch is that now each of the datacenters needs a static IP
address, an open firewall port, and a set of WireGuard keys. When we add a
new user, we’ll have to distribute the new key to all five servers. When we
add a new server, we’ll have to distribute its key to every user. But we can
do it, right? It’s only about 5 times as much work as one hub, which is not that
much work.</p>
<h4 id="mesh-networks">Mesh networks</h4>
<p>So that’s hub-and-spoke networks. They’re not too hard to set up with
WireGuard, although a bit tedious, and we haven’t really talked about safe
practices for key management yet (see below).</p>
<p>Still, there’s something fundamentally awkward about hub-and-spoke: they
don’t let your individual nodes talk to each other. If you’re old like me,
you <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/remembering-the-lan/">remember when computers could just exchange files directly without
going to the cloud and back</a>. That was how the
Internet all used to work, believe it or not! Sadly, developers have
stopped building peer-to-peer apps because the modern Internet’s architecture has
evolved, almost by accident, entirely into this kind of hub-and-spoke
design, usually with the major cloud providers in the center charging rent.</p>
<p>Remember those “extremely lightweight” WireGuard tunnels? Wouldn’t it be
nice if you could directly connect all the nodes to all the other nodes?
That’s called a mesh network:</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/mesh-network.svg" alt="Ten nodes, each connected with each other, resulting in 90 different connections.">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>
        Figure 3. A Tailscale point-to-point mesh network minimizes latency.
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>That would be very elegant—at least, it would let you design elegant
peer-to-peer apps—but it would be tricky. As mentioned above, a 10-node
network would require 10 x 9 = 90 WireGuard tunnels, and every node would
need to know its own key plus 9 more, and each node would have to be updated
every time you rotate a key or add/remove a user.</p>
<p>And the nodes would all
have to find each other somehow—user devices rarely have static IP
addresses—and reconnect whenever one of them moves around.</p>
<p>Plus, you can’t easily open a firewall port for every single node to allow
incoming connections in, say, a cafe, hotel, or airport.</p>
<p>And then, after you’ve done all that, if your
company has compliance requirements, you need to be able to somehow block
and audit traffic between all the nodes, even though it’s no longer all
going through a central location that you can clamp down.</p>
<p>Tailscale makes all that work too! Let’s talk about how. This is where
things get a bit hairy.</p>
<h3 id="the-control-plane-key-exchange-and-coordination">The control plane: key exchange and coordination</h3>
<p>Okay, we’ve made it this far. We got WireGuard connecting. We got it
connecting to multiple things at a time. We’ve marvelled at its unparalleled
reliability and efficiency. Great! Now we want to build a mesh
network - everything connected to everything else.</p>
<p>All those firewalls and dynamic IP addresses are tricky, so let’s leave them
aside for the moment. (See further below.) For now, pretend the whole world
uses static IPs (dare we say… IPv6?) and that firewalls don’t exist or
that it’s easy to open ports.</p>
<p>How do we get all the WireGuard encryption keys (a simplified and more
secure form of “certificates”) onto every device?</p>
<p>For that, we use the <a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">open source Tailscale node
software</a>. It talks to what we
call a “coordination server” (in our case, login.tailscale.com)—essentially,
a shared dropbox for public keys.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/mesh-coordination-server.svg" alt="Nodes connecting to the Tailscale coordination server in the center.">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>
        Figure 4. Tailscale public keys and metadata are shared through a centralized coordination server.
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Hold on, are we back to hub-and-spoke again? Not exactly. The so-called “control
plane” is hub and spoke, but that doesn’t matter because it carries
virtually no traffic. It just exchanges a few tiny encryption keys and sets
policies. The data plane is a mesh.</p>
<p>(We like this hybrid centralized-distributed model. Companies and teams
usually want to have central control, but they don’t want a central
bottleneck for their data. Traditional VPN concentrators centralize both,
limiting performance, especially under stress. Conversely, Tailscale’s data
processing power scales up with the number of nodes.)</p>
<p>Here’s what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each node generates a random public/private keypair for itself, and
associates the public key with its identity (see login, below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The node contacts the coordination server and leaves its public key and a
note about where that node can currently be found, and what domain it’s in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The node downloads a list of public keys and addresses in its domain,
which have been left on the coordination server by other nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The node configures its WireGuard instance with the appropriate set of
public keys.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the private key never, ever leaves its node. This is important
because the private key is the only thing that could potentially be used to
impersonate that node when negotiating a WireGuard session. As a result,
only that node can encrypt packets addressed from itself, or decrypt packets
addressed to itself. It’s important to keep that in mind: Tailscale node
connections are end-to-end encrypted (a concept called “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072WD347M/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">zero trust
networking</a>").</p>
<p>Unlike a hub-and-spoke network, unencrypted packets never need to be sent
over a wire, and no intermediary can inspect them. (The exception is if you
use <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/install-subnets">subnet routes</a>, which
are useful for incremental deployment, which Tailscale supports. You can
create a hybrid network that combines new-style mesh connections with zero
or more old-style “hubs” that decrypt packets, then forward them
to legacy physical networks.)</p>
<h4 id="login-and-2-factor-auth-2fa">Login and 2-factor auth (2FA)</h4>
<p>But we skipped over a detail. How does the coordination server know which
public keys should be sent to which nodes? Public keys are just
that—public—so they are harmless to leak to anyone, or even post on a public
web site. This is exactly the same situation as an ssh server with an
authorized_keys file; you don’t have to keep your public ssh key secret,
but you still have to be careful which public keys you put in
authorized_keys.</p>
<p>There are many ways to make the authentication decision. An obvious way would be to build
a username+password system, also known as PSK (pre-shared keys). To set up
your node, connect to the server, enter your username and password, then
upload your public key and download other public keys posted by either your
account or other accounts in your domain. If you want to get fancy, you can
add two-factor authentication (2FA, also known as MFA) such as SMS, Google
Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, and so on.</p>
<p>A system administrator could also set up your machine with a “<a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1010/machine-certs">machine
certificate</a>” — a key that belongs permanently (or semi-permanently) to the
device rather than to the user account. It could use this to ensure that,
even with the right username and password, an untrusted device can never
publish new keys to the coordination server.</p>
<p>Tailscale operates a coordination server based around these concepts.
However, we don’t handle user authentication ourselves. Instead, we always
outsource authentication to an <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1013/sso-providers">OAuth2, OIDC (OpenID Connect), or SAML
provider</a>. Popular ones include
Gmail, GSuite, and Office365.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/tailscale-single.svg" alt="5 nodes, coordination server in the middle, connected to Office365, and Office365 auth server connects back to Active Directory inside your central office">
    
    
    <figcaption>

        Figure 5. Tailscale 2FA authentication flow in the control plane.
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The auth provider maintains a list of users in your domain, passwords, 2FA
settings, and so on. This avoids the need to maintain a separate set of user
accounts or certificates for your VPN — you can use the authentication you
already have set up for use with Google Docs, Office 365, and other web
apps. Also, because all your private user account and login data is hosted
on another service, Tailscale is able to operate a highly reliable central
coordination service while holding a minimum of your users’ personally identifiable
information (PII). (Read our <a href="https://tailscale.com/privacy-policy">privacy
policy</a> for more.)</p>
<p>You also don’t have to change how you do single sign-on, account creation
and removal, password recovery, and 2FA setup. It’s all exactly like what
you already have.</p>
<p>And because of all that, Tailscale domains can activate instantly the moment
you login. If you download our macOS or iOS app from the App Store, for
example, and login to your account, this immediately creates a secure key
drop box for your domain and lets you exchange public keys with other
devices in that account or domain, like a Windows or Linux server.</p>
<p>And then, as we just saw, the public keys get downloaded to each node,
each node configures WireGuard with a super-lightweight tunnel to each other
node, and ta da! A mesh network in two minutes!</p>
<h4 id="nat-traversal">NAT traversal</h4>
<p>…but we’re not quite done yet. Recall that up above, we decided to pretend that
every node has a static IP address and an open firewall port for
incoming WireGuard traffic. In real life, that’s not too likely.
In real life, some of your nodes are in cafes or on airplanes or
LTE on the highway with one bar of signal, battery drained,
fleeing desperately from the cops across state lines… oh, sorry, wrong movie.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the worst case what you have is something like this:</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/tailscale-remote-access.svg" alt="A laptop in a cafe accessing another laptop on a hotel Wi-Fi, through two NATs.">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>
        Figure 6. Tailscale can connect even when both nodes are behind separate NAT firewalls.
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>That’s two NATs, no open ports. Historically, people would ask you to enable
uPnP on your firewall, but that rarely works and even when it does work, it
usually works <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/122487/htg-explains-is-upnp-a-security-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">dangerously
well</a>
until administrators turn it off.</p>
<p>For now, suffice it to say that Tailscale uses several very advanced techniques,
based on the Internet <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">STUN</a> and
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8445" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">ICE</a> standards, to make these
connections work even though you wouldn’t think it should be possible. This
avoids the need for firewall configurations or any public-facing open ports,
and thus greatly reduces the potential for human error.</p>
<p>My teammate Dave Anderson is writing a post about all the insanity that
is NAT traversal. That alone will probably be as long as this entire article.
Stay tuned!</p>
<h4 id="encrypted-tcp-relays-derp">Encrypted TCP relays (DERP)</h4>
<p>Just one more thing! Some especially cruel networks block UDP entirely, or
are otherwise so strict that they simply cannot be traversed using STUN and
ICE. For those situations, Tailscale provides a network of so-called DERP
(Designated Encrypted Relay for Packets) servers. These fill the same role
as <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5766" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">TURN servers</a> in the ICE standard,
except they use HTTPS streams and WireGuard keys instead of the obsolete
TURN recommendations.</p>
<p>Relaying through DERP looks like this:</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/tailscale-relay.svg" alt="Client nodes in different offices across North America, connecting over the nearest DERP server. Data is headed towards a node, is always sent to the DERP server nearest to the destination node.">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <p>
        Figure 7. Tailscale asymmetrically routes traffic through the DERP nearest to each recipient.
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>(Side note: despite how it might look above, we
really do
have a globally distributed network of relay servers. It's not just the
United States. In the words of our intrepid designer, "I was hoping to
include London in there, but finding two SVGs with compatible non-Mercator
projections was a disaster." This is how much we care about technical
accuracy. Also, stop using Mercator projections. They're super misleading.)</p>
<p>Remember that Tailscale private keys never leave the node where they were
generated; that means there is never a way for a DERP server to decrypt your
traffic. It just blindly forwards already-encrypted traffic from one node to
another. This is like any other router on the Internet, albeit using a
slightly fancier protocol to prevent abuse.</p>
<p>Many people on the Internet are curious about whether WireGuard supports
TCP, like OpenVPN does. Currently this is not built into WireGuard itself,
but the open source Tailscale node software includes DERP support, which
adds this feature. Over time, it’s possible the code will be refactored to
include this feature in WireGuard itself. (Tailscale has already contributed
several fixes and improvements to WireGuard-Go.) We have also open sourced
<a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/tree/master/derp" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">the (quite simple) DERP relay server
code</a> so you can
see exactly how it works.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-acls-and-security-policies">Bonus: ACLs and security policies</h4>
<p>People often think of VPNs as “security” software. This categorization seems obvious
because VPNs are filled with cryptography and public/private keys and
certificates. But VPNs really fit in the category of “connectivity”
software: they increase the number of devices that can get into your private
network. They don’t decrease it, like security software would.</p>
<p>As a result, VPN concentrators (remember the hub-and-spoke model from up
above) are usually coupled with firewalls; sometimes they’re even sold
together. All the traffic comes from individual client devices, flows
through the VPN concentrator, then into the firewall, which applies access
controls based on IP addresses, and finally into the network itself.</p>
<p>That model works, but it can become a pain. First of all, firewall rules are
usually based on IP addresses, not users or roles, so they can be very
awkward to configure safely. As a result, you end up having to add more
layers of authentication, at the transport or application layers. Why do you
need ssh or HTTPS? Because the network layer is too insecure to be trusted.</p>
<p>Second, firewalls are often scattered around the
organization and need to be configured individually. If you have a
multi-hub network (for example, with different VPN concentrators in
different geographic locations), you have to make sure to configure the
firewall correctly on each one, or risk a security breach.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s usually a pain to configure some particular vendor’s
VPN/firewall device to authenticate VPN connections against some other
vendor’s identity system. This is why some identity system vendors will try
to sell you a VPN, and some VPN vendors will try to sell you an identity
system.</p>
<p>When you switch to a mesh network, this problem seems to get even worse —
there is no central point at all, so where do you even put the firewall
rules? In Tailscale, the answer is: in every single node. Each node is
responsible for blocking incoming connections that should not be allowed, at
decryption time.</p>
<p>To make that easier, your company’s security policy is stored on the
Tailscale coordination server, all in one place, and automatically
distributed to each node. This way you have central control over policy, but
efficient, distributed enforcement.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/tailscale-acls.svg" alt="Figure 8. Central ACL policies are enforced by each Tailscale node's incoming packet filter.">
    
    
    <figcaption>

        Figure 8. Central ACL policies are enforced by each Tailscale node's incoming packet filter.
        
            
        
        </p> 
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>At a less granular level, the coordination server (key drop box) protects
nodes by giving each node the public keys of only the nodes that are
supposed to connect to it. Other Internet computers are unable to even
request a connection, because without the right public key in the list,
their encrypted packets cannot be decoded. It’s like the unauthorized
machines don’t even exist. This is a very powerful protection model; it
prevents virtually any kind of protocol-level attack. As a result, Tailscale
is especially good at protecting legacy, non-web based services that are no
longer maintained or receiving updates.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-audit-logs">Bonus: Audit logs</h4>
<p>Another concern of companies with tight compliance requirements is audit
trails. Modern firewalls don’t just block traffic — they log it. Since
Tailscale doesn’t have a central traffic funnel, what can you do?</p>
<p>The answer is: we allow you to log all internal network connections from
each node, asynchronously, to a central logging service. An interesting side
effect of this design is that every connection is logged twice: on the
source machine and the destination machine. As a result, log tampering is
easy to detect, because it would require simultaneous tampering on two
different nodes.</p>
<p>Because logs are streamed in real time from each node, rather than batched,
the window for local log tampering on a node is extremely short, in the
order of dozens of milliseconds, making even a single-node tampering attack
difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Tailscale’s central logging service has controllable retention periods and
each node just logs some metadata about how your internal mesh is
established, not Internet usage or personal information. (Read our <a href="https://tailscale.com/privacy-policy">privacy
policy</a> for more.)</p>
<p>Rather than providing a complete logs and metrics pipeline, the Tailscale
logging service is intended as a real-time streaming data collector that can
then stream data out into your preferred SIEM (Security Information &amp; Event
Management) system. (You can <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190216" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">read my early blog post that evolved into
Tailscale’s logs collector architecture</a>.)</p>
<h4 id="bonus-incremental-deployment">Bonus: Incremental deployment</h4>
<p>There is one last question that comes up a lot: given that Tailscale creates
a mesh “overlay” network (a VPN that parallels a company’s internal physical
network), does a company have to switch to it all at once? Many BeyondCorp
and zero-trust style products work that way. Or can it be deployed
incrementally, starting with a small proof of concept?</p>
<p>Tailscale is uniquely suited to incremental deployments. Since you don’t
need to install any hardware or any servers at all, you can get started in
two minutes: just install the Tailscale node software onto two devices
(Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS), login to both devices with the same user
account or auth domain, and that’s it! They’re securely connected, no matter how the
devices move around. Tailscale runs on top of your existing network, so you
can safely deploy it without disrupting your existing infrastructure and
security settings.</p>
<p>You can then extend the network by adding <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/install-subnets">subnet
routes</a> to one or more
offices or datacenters, building up a traditional hub-and-spoke or multi-hub
VPN.</p>
<p>As you gain confidence, you can install Tailscale on more servers or
containers, which allows point-to-point fully encrypted connections (no
unencrypted traffic carried over any LAN). This final configuration is
called “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072WD347M/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">zero trust
networking</a>,”
which is gaining fame lately, but so far has been hard to attain.</p>
<p>With Tailscale, you can build up to “zero trust,” one employee device and
one server at a time. After the incremental deployment is done, you can
safely shut down your legacy or unencrypted access methods.</p>
