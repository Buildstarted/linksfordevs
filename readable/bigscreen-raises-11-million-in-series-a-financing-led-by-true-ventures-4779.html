This round was led by True Ventures with participation from Andreessen Horowitz. Toni Schneider‚ÄìPartner at True Ventures‚Äìwill be joining the board. This brings our total financing raised to-date to <strong>$14 million.</strong></p><p id="6c24" data-selectable-paragraph="">We‚Äôve taken a disciplined, lean approach by building a small team, and we plan to stay that way. This is especially important in emerging industries like VR/AR. The new funding enables us to build a long-lasting company, grow the team, and accelerate the development and expansion of our platform.</p><p id="e7fc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Read more in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bigscreen-lands-series-a-to-take-vr-to-work-1507635001" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Wall Street Journal</strong></a></p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="1090" data-selectable-paragraph="">As a small, fully remote team of developers around the world, we‚Äôve spent very little of our $3 million seed financing. With several years of runway ahead of us, we didn‚Äôt <em>need</em> to raise additional funding.</p><p id="930b" data-selectable-paragraph="">However, over the past year, Bigscreen has grown significantly to more than a quarter million users. In just the past few months‚Äìled by several <a href="https://blog.bigscreenvr.com/tagged/product-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major product updates</a>‚Äì<strong>our</strong> <strong>core metrics grew over 300%</strong>. Our power users spend 20‚Äì30+ hours using Bigscreen every week, and many users have <a href="https://uploadvr.com/bigscreen-local-multiplayer-1000-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent more than 1,000 hours in Bigscreen</a>.</p><p id="05b0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Based on usage and user reviews, Bigscreen is now one of the most popular VR apps in the world. <strong>Bigscreen has become a killer app for VR (and we‚Äôre just getting started)</strong></p><p id="11f9" data-selectable-paragraph="">We now need to grow the team in order to improve the product and expand the Bigscreen platform to more VR/AR devices.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><blockquote><p id="736c" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong><em>Our goal is to build immensely useful software for VR/AR headsets that‚Äìone day, in 5‚Äì10 years‚Äìpeople could use for 10 hours a day, every day.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p id="bced" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the past few decades of personal computing, we have crammed applications into tiny computer screens. For multi-tasking and organization, the most we can do is tabbed browsing. <strong>Immersive headsets enable us to break out of the screen </strong>and design computing applications the way humans think: spatially. With Bigscreen, you can have a browser in front of you, Netflix on the wall, and a Spotify music player floating to your side.</p><p id="8738" data-selectable-paragraph="">Secondly, VR enables us to immerse ourselves in virtual worlds that feels like a real, physical space. Our cinema environment features a 110-foot screen and realistic lighting that makes us <em>feel</em> like we‚Äôre watching movies in an actual movie theater.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/30/1*gGQOjVkwZAAO8DeQBpiRGw.jpeg?q=20" width="1920" height="1016" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="1920" height="1016" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">The Bigscreen ‚ÄúCinema‚Äù has a 110-foot screen &amp; realistic real-time lighting</figcaption></figure><p id="8faa" data-selectable-paragraph="">VR is also powerful for <strong>collaborative and social applications</strong>. 2D videoconferencing limits natural communication, gesturing, and eye contact. Using Bigscreen with VR hand controllers, users can convey more body language than with just a webcam, and effortlessly communicate ideas.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*iI7aD32Nqi97Li4zikIMoQ.gif?q=20" width="700" height="394" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="700" height="394" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">Two people using VR headsets and <a href="http://bigscreenvr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bigscreen</a> to collaborate on 3D modeling in Autodesk‚Ñ¢ Maya‚Ñ¢</figcaption></figure><p id="1c55" data-selectable-paragraph="">Although VR may appear like a ‚Äúsilly, expensive toy for gamers‚Äù today, <strong>VR/AR is the next computing medium</strong>. In the next decade, VR/AR devices will be lightweight, affordable, stylish glasses. Eventually, all of our day-to-day computing activities‚Äìweb browsing, word processing, movie watching, and gaming‚Äìwill occur inside immersive VR/AR headsets.</p><blockquote><p id="1f6a" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong><em>To put it differently, Bigscreen is creating the virtual version of real-world movie theaters, living rooms, lounges, and workspaces.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p id="1d68" data-selectable-paragraph="">People use Bigscreen in 3 ways: public multiplayer (Internet friends), private multiplayer (friends), and singleplayer (60% use Bigscreen solo).<strong> The most popular use case of Bigscreen is to watch videos in a virtual reality cinema</strong>. This enables people to relax in the comfort of their own home, while feeling like they‚Äôre watching Netflix or Game of Thrones in a IMAX-like theater. Some ways people used Bigscreen surprised us:</p><ul><li id="380b" data-selectable-paragraph=""><mark>Couples in long-distance relationships use Bigscreen for ‚Äúvirtual date night‚Äù to </mark><mark><strong>relax and watch a movie togethe</strong></mark><mark>r in our virtual reality cinema.</mark></li><li id="4a8b" data-selectable-paragraph="">College students are using Bigscreen to <strong>focus and study</strong> in a distraction-free and serene virtual environment, unlike their cramped dorm room.</li><li id="f416" data-selectable-paragraph="">College students are virtually hanging out and playing video games with old high school friends living on the other side of the country.</li><li id="d70f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Gamers love using Bigscreen to play their favorite (non-VR) PC videogames on massive screens.
