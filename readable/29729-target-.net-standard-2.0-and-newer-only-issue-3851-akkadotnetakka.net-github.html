And, out of the portion of developers <em>not</em> on the latest version, how comfortable they would be moving to the latest version.  When I was working in such environments, bumping a minor version without a significant business case was seen as a large risk.  So, if you were to drop support for 4.5.2 in the near future it's safe to say these developers are not affected.  Like netclectic said, the survey can help identify the likelihood of this impact.</p><p>From my own perspective, I think there's a line we can draw to say "It's reasonable to support [x.x.x] as a minimum .NET version."  We can push that line closer to more modern versions by using the .NET Standard and .NET Core compatibility matrix, and supplementing with preprocessors for conditional code.  Akka.NET is already taking advantage of this in some places, so it's just a matter of finding the balance.</p><p>I was a big fan of Play Framework and Lagom Framework when it first started, and it was usually every month or so I was faced with a breaking change.  But, I think both of those frameworks would be drastically different today if they didn't embrace change.  Although I don't have the same level of following with my .NET port of <a href="https://github.com/nagytech/lagom-dotnet">Lagom framework</a>, I try to maintain an opinionated approach to changing for the better.</p><p>Overall, I think it's reasonable to draw the line somewhere but still provide or encourage community level patch level support for those left behind.</p></div></div></div></div>
