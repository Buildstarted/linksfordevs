They are a great alternative to simply placing a breakpoint on a property‚Äôs setter because a data breakpoint focuses on a <em>specific </em>object‚Äôs property even when it‚Äôs out of scope, whereas the former option may result in constant, irrelevant breaks if you have hundreds of objects calling that function.</p><h3>How do I set a data breakpoint?</h3><p>Setting a data breakpoint is as easy as right-clicking on the property you‚Äôre interested in watching inside the watch, autos, or locals window and selecting ‚ÄúBreak when value changes‚Äù in the context menu.&nbsp; All data breakpoints are displayed in the Breakpoints window. They are also represented by the standard, red breakpoint circle next to the specified property.</p><figure id="attachment_223578" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223578"><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/02/ManagedDataBreakpointSet.gif" data-featherlight="image"> <img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/02/ManagedDataBreakpointSet.gif" alt="Setting a data breakpoint" width="1208" height="791"> </a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-223578">Setting a data breakpoint in the Locals window and viewing the breakpoint in the Breakpoints window</figcaption></figure><h3>When can I use data breakpoints?</h3><p>Now that you know how to set a data breakpoint, now what?&nbsp; Here are some ways to take advantage of data breakpoints when debugging your .NET Core applications.</p><p>Let‚Äôs say that you want to figure out who is modifying a property in an object and for most of the time, this property change does not happen in the same file. By setting a data breakpoint on the property of interest and continuing, the data breakpoint will stop at the line after the property has been modified.</p><figure id="attachment_223579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223579"><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/02/ManagedDataBreakpointBreakWhenValueChanges.gif" data-featherlight="image"> <img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/02/ManagedDataBreakpointBreakWhenValueChanges.gif" alt="Break when value changes" width="1208" height="791"> </a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-223579">Break when _data value changes</figcaption></figure><p>This also works for objects. The data breakpoint will stop when the property referencing the object changes value, not when the contents of the object change.</p><figure id="attachment_223580" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223580"><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/02/ManagedDataBreakpointBreakWhenValueChangesObject.gif" data-featherlight="image"> <img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/02/ManagedDataBreakpointBreakWhenValueChangesObject.gif" alt="Break when object reference changes" width="1208" height="791"> </a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-223580">Break when the property referencing an object changes</figcaption></figure><p>As illustrated in the GIF above, calling the toEdit._artist.ChangeName() function did not cause a breakpoint to hit since it was modifying a property (Name) inside the Song‚Äôs Artist property.&nbsp; In contrast, the data breakpoint hits when the _artist property is assigned a reference to a new object.</p><p>Data breakpoints are also useful when you want to know when something is added or removed from a collection. Setting a data breakpoint on the ‚ÄòCount‚Äô field of classes from System.Collections.Generic makes it easy to detect when the collection has changed.</p><figure id="attachment_223581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223581"><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/02/ManagedDataBreakpointSetOnListCount.gif" data-featherlight="image"> <img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/02/ManagedDataBreakpointSetOnListCount.gif" alt="Break when item is added or removed from list" width="1208" height="791"> </a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-223581">Break when an object is added or removed from a list<strong>&nbsp;</strong></figcaption></figure><h3>Are there opportunities for improving managed data breakpoints?</h3><p>Since Visual Studio 2019 is still in preview, we highly encourage you to experiment, play around with, and provide feedback for this iteration of data breakpoints.&nbsp; Here are some known scenarios where data breakpoints currently cannot be set that we are working on erasing and improving in future Visual Studio updates:</p><ul><li>Properties that are not expandable in the tooltip, Locals, Autos, or Watch window</li><li>Static variables</li><li>Classes with the DebuggerTypeProxy Attribute</li><li>Fields inside of structs</li></ul><p>Managed data breakpoints also exclude properties that call native code and properties that depend on too many fields.</p><h3>Ready to try data breakpoints in your .NET Core applications?&nbsp; Let us know in the comments!</h3><p>For any issues or suggestions about this feature, please let us know via Help &gt; Send Feedback &gt; <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio-2017" target="_blank">Report a Problem</a> in the IDE or in the <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/8/index.html" target="_blank">Developer Community</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>
