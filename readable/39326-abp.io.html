    <section class="post-content"> <p>Today is the big day! After ~3 years of continuous development, first stable ABP release, 1.0, has been released. Thanks to everyone contributed to the project or tried it so far.</p>
<p>Start playing with the new ABP framework now: <a href="https://abp.io/get-started">abp.io/get-started</a></p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>Here, a few GitHub &amp; NuGet statistics about the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>2,360 stars.</li>
<li>5,917 commits.</li>
<li>72 contributors.</li>
<li>1,136 issues were closed, 276 open.</li>
<li>566 PRs were closed, 5 open.</li>
<li>39 releases.</li>
<li>122,795 downloads on NuGet.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was an excellent demand even before the first release.</p>
<h2>Road Map</h2>
<p>The first priority is to complete the documentation, since there are still a lot of missing documents for the framework features &amp; the modules. Then we will continue to work on the issues on GitHub, based on the labeled priorities.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestones">GitHub milestone items</a>.</p>
<p>ABP is a community-driven project. So, we are prioritizing the issues mostly based on the community feedback and demand.</p> </section>
