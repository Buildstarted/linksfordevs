The <strong><a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracinggems/">Table of Contents</a></strong> for the 32 articles is now public. The <a href="https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484244272">publisher’s webpage is up</a>. There’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Gems-High-Quality-Real-Time/dp/1484244265?tag=realtimerenderin">an Amazon page</a> in progress (BTW, the after-the-colon title, “High-Quality and Real-Time Rendering with DXR and Other APIs,” was requested by the publisher to help search engines find the book).</p><p>The hardback book should be available at GDC and GTC, with a free electronic version(s) available sometime before or around then, along with a source code repository. Also, the book is open access, under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">this CC license</a>. This means that the authors, or anyone else, can redistribute these articles as they wish, as long as it’s a non-commercial use and they credit the book as the source.</p><p>Here’s the cover, which should be on the other sites soon.</p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4927" src="http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RTG_cover.jpg" alt="&quot;Ray Tracing Gems&quot; cover" width="561" height="804" srcset="http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RTG_cover.jpg 561w, http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RTG_cover-209x300.jpg 209w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px"></p><p>By the way, if you want to read an article about ray tracing actual&nbsp;<em>gems</em>, <a href="https://www.whiteflash.com/ags-cut-grade-research.pdf">this one is a good place to start</a>. I happened upon it by accident, and it’s educational, approachable, and not dumbed down. The design criteria for a good gem cut are fun to read about: maximize reflected light as well as contrast, take into account that the viewer’s head will block off light, and so on. If you need a more serious paper from graphics people, there’s <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1015708">this article</a>. Surprisingly, though fairly old, it is newer than any of the articles cited by the first, much newer article.</p></div></div></div></div>
