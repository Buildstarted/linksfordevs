We built the Epic Games launcher on PC and Mac featuring Fortnite and Unreal Engine; we built a worldwide digital commerce ecosystem supporting dozens of payment methods; and we gained great economies of scale thanks to Fortnite's growth.<br><img alt="EpicGamesStore.jpg" height="auto" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/UnrealEngine%2FNews%2FAnnouncing+the+Epic+Games+Store%2FEpicGamesStore-1400x788-115627d82416826e240d42891ede4afe7975ba19.jpg" width="auto"><br>As developers ourselves, we wanted two things: a store with fair economics, and a direct relationship with players. And we've heard that many of you want this too!<p>Soon we'll launch the Epic Games store, and begin a long journey to advance the cause of all developers. The store will launch with a hand-curated set of games on PC and Mac, then it will open up more broadly to other games and to Android and other open platforms throughout 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>The Epic Games store will operate on the following principles:</p><p><strong>All Developers Earn 88%</strong><br>Developers receive 88% of revenue. There are no tiers or thresholds. Epic takes 12%. And if you’re using Unreal Engine, Epic will cover the 5% engine royalty for sales on the Epic Games store, out of Epic’s 12%.<br><img alt="EpicGamesStore_InfoGraphic.jpg" height="auto" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/UnrealEngine%2FNews%2FAnnouncing+the+Epic+Games+Store%2FEpicGamesStore_InfoGraphic-1920x1080-df66848d0d804e4366355775eae247a9abdeb1e7.jpg" width="auto"><br><strong>Have a Direct Relationship With Players</strong><br>People who buy your games automatically subscribe to your newsfeed so you can reach them with game updates and news about upcoming releases. The newsfeed is front-and-center. &nbsp;You’ll also be able to reach your players through email, if they choose to share it.</p><p><strong>Connect with Creators</strong><br>YouTube content creators, Twitch streamers, bloggers, and others are at the leading edge of game discovery. The 10,000-strong Epic Games Support-A-Creator program helps you reach creators, so they can help you reach players. If you opt to participate, creators who refer players to buy your game will receive a share of the revenue that you set (tracked by code or affiliate marketing link). To jumpstart the creator economy, Epic will cover the first 5% of creator revenue-sharing for the first 24 months.<br><strong>Developers Control Their Game Pages</strong><br>As a developer, you control your game page and your newsfeed. There will be no store-placed ads or cross-marketing of competing games on your page, and no paid ads in search results.</p><p><strong>All Engines Are Welcome</strong><br>The Epic Games store is open to games built with any engine, and the first releases span Unreal, Unity and internal engines.</p><p><strong>When You Succeed, We Succeed</strong><br>We’ve built this store and its economic model so that Epic’s interests are aligned with your interests. &nbsp;Because of the high volume of Fortnite transactions, we can process store payments, serve bandwidth, and support customers very efficiently. From Epic’s 12% store fee, we’ll have a profitable business we’ll grow and reinvest in for years to come!</p><p>--</p><p>More details on upcoming game releases will be revealed at The Game Awards this Thursday, December 6th.</p></div></div></div></div>
