<p>From the beginning, Mixer has been about creating the most engaging and interactive livestreaming experience. We set out to help streamers build great communities based on deep engagement with their audience. You all have been amazing throughout this journey – the Mixer community&nbsp;has&nbsp;focused on creating&nbsp;welcoming and inclusive communities, and you should be proud of&nbsp;what you have accomplished together.</p>



<p>Ultimately,&nbsp;the success of Partners and streamers on Mixer is dependent on our ability to scale the&nbsp;platform&nbsp;for&nbsp;them&nbsp;as quickly and broadly as possible.&nbsp;It became clear that the time needed to grow our own livestreaming community to scale was out of measure with the vision and experiences&nbsp;that Microsoft and Xbox&nbsp;want to deliver for gamers now,&nbsp;so&nbsp;we’ve decided to close the operations side of Mixer and help the community transition to a new platform.&nbsp;To better serve&nbsp;our community’s needs,&nbsp;we’re teaming up&nbsp;with Facebook&nbsp;to enable the Mixer community to transition to&nbsp;Facebook Gaming.&nbsp;This is a key part of a&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/06/22/bringing-more-players-into-our-gaming-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broader&nbsp;effort</a>&nbsp;that Xbox and Facebook Gaming are embarking on, bringing new experiences and opportunities to the entire world of gaming.</p>



<p>The Facebook Gaming team and Creators&nbsp;will help expand the vision&nbsp;that Mixer has&nbsp;always&nbsp;held around community and building a platform that is inclusive and supportive of each other. For Mixer’s streamers, this opens up the&nbsp;opportunity to reach the&nbsp;vast audience of&nbsp;one of the world’s fastest growing streaming platforms. Every month, more than 700 million people play a game, watch a gaming video or interact in a gaming Group on Facebook.&nbsp;For Facebook Gaming’s Creators, this&nbsp;brings the&nbsp;ability to partner closely with the Xbox ecosystem, including future opportunities around Xbox Game Pass, Project&nbsp;xCloud&nbsp;and more.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/fbgaminghome/blog/welcome-mixer-facebook-gaming" target="_blank">Facebook Gaming</a>&nbsp;is making it easy for everyone in the Mixer community to join, if they choose&nbsp;to do so:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Mixer Partners will be granted partner status with Facebook Gaming, and the platform will honor and match all existing Partner agreements as closely as possible.&nbsp;Mixer&nbsp;Partners will receive an update from Mixer&nbsp;today on how&nbsp;to&nbsp;kickoff&nbsp;the sign-up process.</li><li>Streamers participating in Mixer’s open monetization program will be granted eligibility for the Facebook Gaming Level Up&nbsp;Program, where you can continue&nbsp;to grow and monetize your streams.&nbsp;Facebook Gaming will&nbsp;also fast-track onboarding for eligible streamers.</li><li>We encourage all&nbsp;Mixer viewers to spend their&nbsp;remaining&nbsp;Embers and Sparks to help support&nbsp;your&nbsp;favorite Mixer Partners and streamers. Mixer Partners will&nbsp;receive&nbsp;double-payment for all of their earnings in the month of June – so your support of Embers, Sparks and channel subscriptions for Mixer Partners will go even further&nbsp;during&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;this month.&nbsp;</li><li>Viewers with outstanding Ember balances, channel subscriptions or Mixer Pro subscriptions will&nbsp;receive&nbsp;Xbox Gift Card credit as a thank you for your engagement on the platform. Details on what you can expect can be found at this&nbsp;FAQ.&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;Mixer&nbsp;service&nbsp;will&nbsp;continue&nbsp;to&nbsp;run through&nbsp;July&nbsp;22, 2020.&nbsp;After&nbsp;that, Mixer.com will redirect to fb.gg,&nbsp;Facebook’s desktop home for gaming&nbsp;video,&nbsp;Mixer broadcasting on Xbox One will be&nbsp;temporarily&nbsp;disabled and the Mixer apps will notify or redirect viewers to continue watching their favorite streamers at&nbsp;Facebook Gaming.&nbsp;</li><li>For more details on what this means for you, check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aka.ms/NextStepForMixerFAQ" target="_blank">this&nbsp;FAQ</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Thank you,&nbsp;Mixer community,&nbsp;for&nbsp;your engagement and passion on this journey. We have accomplished so much together, and we want to thank you all – Partners, streamers, moderators and viewers. And&nbsp;we hope&nbsp;to&nbsp;see&nbsp;your continued positive, welcoming and inclusive ideals&nbsp;continue&nbsp;on at Facebook Gaming.</p>
