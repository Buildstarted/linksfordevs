<p>The <a href="frost-extabs.pdf">extended abstract</a> of our paper is currently available.</p>
<p>Unlike signatures in a single-party setting, threshold signatures
require cooperation among a threshold number of signers each holding a
share of a common private key. Consequently, generating signatures in a
threshold setting imposes overhead due to network rounds among signers,
proving costly when secret shares are stored on network-limited devices
or when coordination occurs over unreliable networks. In this work, we
present FROST, a Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signature
scheme that improves upon the state of the art to reduce network
overhead during signing operations. We present two variants of signing
operations in FROST, the first requiring participants to send and
receive two messages in total, and an optimized single-round variant
with a batched non-interactive pre-processing stage. FROST achieves its
efficiency improvements by allowing the protocol to abort in the
presence of a misbehaving party (who is then identified and excluded
from future operations)&#x2014;a reasonable model for practical
deployment scenarios. We present two use cases of threshold signatures
demonstrating the practicality of this tradeoff to real-world
implementations, and prove FROST is as secure as Schnorr&apos;s signature
scheme in a single-party setting.</p>
