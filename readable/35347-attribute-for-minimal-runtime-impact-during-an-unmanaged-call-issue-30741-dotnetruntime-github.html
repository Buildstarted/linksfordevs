If this is meant for advanced users, I think it's better to be specific.</p><hr><p>I need to think about what functions with this attribute can do in Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android - I think it's ok to extend the lifetimes of Java or Objective-C objects (if there's a way to do it without an API call), but probably not to shorten them.</p><hr><p>I wonder if it's worth adding to the restrictions:</p><pre><code>   /// * Does not loop on a condition that relies on another thread to execute in order to exit the loop
</code></pre><p>So for example some kind of busy wait that requires another thread to toggle some value in shared memory before the current function returns.</p><hr><p>We've had situations on Linux in Mono where a function in Cooperative mode called the first function from a shared library (ie, we pinvoked <code>foo()</code> from <code>libfoo.so</code> which tried to call <code>bar()</code> from <code>libbar.so</code> which was the first time the process did anything with <code>libbar</code>) which deadlocked the runtime - the dynamic linker needed to take a lock that was held by another thread. The lock was held by a thread that was  preempted while pinvoking <code>backtrace</code>, which happens to need the same lock.</p><p>So maybe we should also add:</p><pre><code>   /// * Don't call any function for the first time
</code></pre><p>We basically handwaved and pretended like this wasn't happening.</p><hr><pre><code>  /// * Native function does not take locks.
</code></pre><p>This should be</p><pre><code>  /// * Native function does not manipulate locks or other concurrency primitives
</code></pre><p>On Linux, glibc pthreads signalling a condition variable with <code>pthread_cond_signal</code> and <code>pthread_cond_broadcast</code> may need to lock a mutex.  (To rebalance some internal queues)</p><hr><pre><code>  /// * Native function does not performs syscall
</code></pre><p>For the reasons above, this should really be <code>does not call into any library</code>.</p><hr><p>Questions:</p><ul><li><p>How does this attribute interact with argument marshalling?</p></li><li><p>How does this attribute interact with <code>[DllImport (..., SetLastError = true)]</code> ?</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
