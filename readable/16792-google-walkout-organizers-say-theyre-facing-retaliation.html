After escalating the issue to human resources, she said she faced further retaliation. “My manager started ignoring me, my work was given to other people, and I was told to go on medical leave, even though I’m not sick,” Stapleton wrote. After she hired a lawyer, the company conducted an investigation and seemed to reverse her demotion. “While my work has been restored, the environment remains hostile and I consider quitting nearly every day,” she wrote.</p><p>Whittaker and Stapleton are two of the seven employees who helped organize the mass demonstration in November, during which <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-walkout-just-latest-sign-tech-worker-unrest/">20,000 Google workers</a> briefly walked out of their office to protest the company’s mishandling of sexual harassment claims.</p><p>In a statement, a Google spokesperson said: "We prohibit retaliation in the workplace and investigate all allegations. Employees and teams are regularly and commonly given new assignments, or reorganized, to keep pace with evolving business needs. There has been no retaliation here.” Whittaker and Stapleton did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p><strong>Here is the full text of their letter:</strong></p><p><em>Hi all,</em><em>This was a hard email to write.</em></p><p><em>Google is retaliating against several organizers.</em></p><p><em>We are among them and here is what’s happening to us:</em></p><p><strong>Meredith</strong></p><p><em>Just after Google announced that it would disband its AI ethics council, I was informed my role would be changed dramatically. I’m told that to remain at the company I will have to abandon my work on AI ethics and the AI Now Institute, which I cofounded, and which has been doing rigorous and recognized work on these topics. I have worked on issues of AI ethics and bias for years, and am one of the people who helped shape the field looking at these problems. I have also taken risks to push for a more ethical Google, even when this is less profitable or convenient.</em></p><p><strong>Claire</strong></p><p><em>After five years as a high performer in YouTube Marketing (and almost twelve at Google), two months after the Walkout, I was told that I would be demoted, that I’d lose half my reports, and that a project that was approved was no longer on the table. I escalated to HR and to my VP, which made things significantly worse. My manager started ignoring me, my work was given to other people, and I was told to go on medical leave, even though I’m not sick. Only after I hired a lawyer and had her contact Google did management conduct an investigation and walked back my demotion, at least on paper. While my work has been restored, the environment remains hostile and I consider quitting nearly every day.</em></p></div></div></div></div>
