<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p><em><p>Top 10&nbsp;coffee brands based on how much their names are used as passwords. Look, not every password research has to be meaningful.</p> </em></p><p>When Dan Tentler <a href="https://twitter.com/Viss/status/1125861364050718720">stumbled upon an Instagram ad</a> saying that you should hack your morning routine by drinking protein smoothie by Nescaf√©, he's&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Viss/status/1125861364050718720">tweeted</a> that drinking a coffee or a smoothie or changing what you drink in the morning is not hacking, and he's&nbsp;right. But Dan has begun to wonder how many people actually use <code>nescafe</code> as their password, and have learned that quite a lot of them&nbsp;do.</p> <p>Right, but how many? And what about other coffee brands? And what's&nbsp;the best coffee based on how often it is used as a password? Time for a <em>silly password research</em>&nbsp;üôÉ</p> <p><img src="https://www.michalspacek.cz/i/images/blog/haveibeennescafe.png" alt="‚Äúnescafe‚Äù: Oh no&nbsp;‚Äì pwned! This password has been seen 7,708&nbsp;times&nbsp;before" width="616" height="346"></p> <p><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">Pwned Passwords</a> has the number of how many times a password has been seen in various password leaks, it also has an <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#PwnedPasswords">API</a>, and there's&nbsp;a list of coffee brands <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Coffee_brands">on Wikipedia</a>. So here it&nbsp;is‚Ä¶</p> <h2 id="top-10-coffee-brands">Top 10&nbsp;coffee brands</h2> <ol> <li><code>georgia</code> (57531√ó used as a password)</li> <li><code>jacobs</code> (33594√ó)</li> <li><code>starbucks</code> (17286√ó)</li> <li><code>franck</code> (14508√ó)</li> <li><code>nescafe</code> (7708√ó)</li> <li><code>justus</code> (7484√ó)</li> <li><code>timhortons</code> (1436√ó)</li> <li><code>lavazza</code> (1388√ó)</li> <li><code>highpoint</code> (1304√ó)</li> <li><code>folgers</code> (1288√ó)</li> </ol> <p>Yes, almost all of these are also something else than just a coffee. Maybe except Jihlavanka, the Czech coffee brand which is unfortunately produced elsewhere in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>&nbsp;‚Äì <code>jihlavanka</code> has been used 63√ó times as a password. Anyway, Georgia is a state in the U.S., also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)">a country</a> at the boundary between Europe and Asia, a font, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Georgia_(BB-15)">a ship</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Georgia_(SSGN-729)">a submarine</a> and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/359_Georgia">an asteroid</a> (also used as a password <code>georgia359</code>). Georgia is also a name, just like Franck and Justus. Whether people mean the coffee brand or the submarine, we'll never&nbsp;know.</p> <p>But there's&nbsp;just one hardcore fan, whose password is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jittery_Joe%27s"><code>jitteryjoes</code></a>. That's&nbsp;a coffee brand from Athens. The town in Georgia. The Georgia in the U.S. And I'm sorry, nobody cares about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziferblat"><code>ziferblat</code></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Wish_Coffee"><code>deathwishcoffee</code></a> (‚ÄúYour last wish?‚Äù&nbsp;‚Äì ‚ÄúNeed a coffee! Wait, no, I'll change my password instead‚Äù) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keurig_Dr_Pepper"><code>keurigdrpepper</code></a>.</p> <p><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I&nbsp;Been Pwned</a> is run by Troy Hunt and even he's&nbsp;a password for 11&nbsp;people sharing the same name. Seems that nobody uses my first name and last name as a password but <code>mspacek</code> has already been seen 9&nbsp;times, and <code>spacekm</code> has been used by two users. I&nbsp;want to meet them. Although someone tells me that one of those two has ‚Äúmurder‚Äù in their email address so maybe they could just email&nbsp;me.</p> <p>All coffee password and even the script available <a href="https://gist.github.com/spaze/0e47e43096da4bd469a1906d2ba934ff">on GitHub</a>. So what is hacking anyway? For example <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw5lc4kgHE3/">this</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/M8qkL_7Lbyw">this</a>.</p> </div></div></div>
