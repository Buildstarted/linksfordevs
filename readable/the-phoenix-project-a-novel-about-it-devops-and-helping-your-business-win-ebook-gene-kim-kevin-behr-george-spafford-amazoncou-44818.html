The scenarios though are all too realistic, failing companies due to poor ability to respond to the voice of the customer, overrunning major projects with no end in sight,  heroics all around, a failure to understand the voice of the business with security demands, audit requirements and processes that add hours, days and months to lead times, despair and frustration from all quarters and open hostility not just between IT and the rest of the business but an IT civil war too. Yes Bill is almost magical at seeing the problems, Steve changes from antagonist to mentor too easily, I've never seen a change manager as willing to adapt as Patty, so on and so forth, but a story bogged down in meetings wouldn't be of much interest. Oh and Eric. You'll never work with Eric, if you do, follow him everywhere.<p>With these realistic problems that no doubt face most of us the Pheonix Project lays out a number of tools and approaches that will lead the reader to think "damn, that's a good idea" or "that's an amazing way of looking at it". There's a moment in the book (I got it on kindle first, but now I have a physical copy that's getting the highlighter treatment) where one of the executives more or less goes "well dur well done you've figured it out" to which another goes, "well why didn't you think to explain this to everyone?" we often assume that the obvious is obvious to everyone, it's like a person watching poker on TV who can see everyone's cards going "well that outcome was obvious" clearly it wasn't to the people playing who couldn't see the cards.</p><p>All in all this book should be a must-read for everyone in IT or work with IT, it sets out the groundwork for implementing lean principles in IT and I wish I'd read it years ago. To be honest I think anyone with aspirations to help improve workflow through an organisation should read this, and the Goal and then sit down and think about the lessons presented within.</p></span>

Mismanaged projects, time and budget overruns, meddling managers with an inflated sense of self importance, arbitrary and un-achievable deadlines etc.<p>The story follows the life of the newly promoted IT Manager who is tasked with solving these problems and while tackling the issues he learns about DevOps. I found the book itself to be a very entertaining read and the concepts introduced both made sense withing the context of the story and reflect the real world issues a lot of us face as well.</p><p>The book does have a somewhat "accelerated" rate of adoption within the company, most real world scenarios would probably take considerably longer and be much more of a struggle with considerable more meeting - however I doubt many people who be enthralled by that. The story pacing certainly benefits from this approach.</p><p>The comparisons between IT and a typical manufacturing plant makes understanding the concepts underlying DevOps easier than speaking about them in the usual IT language.</p><p>I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who works in an IT / DevOps environment and wants an enjoyable read that also helps with the daily job.</p></span>

What makes is so great is that it is an expertly written, compelling story which leads you on a journey, rather than preaching dry theory.<p>Anyone with experience in IT will be utterly absorbed by the characters and situations in the story. On more than one occasion I felt like I was actually re-living past experiences, as the authors capture the relationships, motivations and consequences so accurately. With a background of failing IT established (which is made so real by shared experiences), the book slowly leads you through the main characters decision making process, showing you all the successes and failures he makes on the way to truly understanding how to manage the flow of work through his IT operations department.</p><p>Again, this book is brilliant, and should be a must-read for anyone either in IT, or in an origination supported by it.</p></span>

This one starts very slowly and dry, but about a quarter of the way in it becomes extremely gripping, and is an amazing insight into the evolution of dev-ops, it's benefits and application, and delivers all the information from an amazing angle I haven't experienced before. I very highly recommend getting this book if you have interest in the field - it'll certainly make you start approaching hurdles at work from a different (and better) perspective. Excellently educational and inspiring.</span>

I don't spend all weekend glued to a book about IT... but this gripped me from the blurb onwards, with relate-able events such as an overrunning project, whose scope increases exponentially, resignations, co-workers going AWOL, poisonous managers, human bottlenecks, under-investment, etc.,  And none of this explains why I had so many late nights, and my husband thought I was being as mad, as when I entered the cats in a cat show or took 6 kids on the coast-to-coast...  It is a great evangelising tool for DevOps. It explains the concepts by using the Phoenix project as a working example, and you must read it (even if you think you know it all after 20+ years in web development).</span>
