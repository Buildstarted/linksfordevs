	<p>In the last year, we’ve released more than 200 new features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>New products to support your workflow like<a href="https://github.com/actions"> Actions</a>,<a href="https://github.com/features/packages"> Packages</a>, and<a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces/"> Codespaces</a>;</li>
<li>A<a href="https://github.com/features/security"> complete end-to-end security solution</a>;</li>
<li>New and updated clients for<a href="https://github.com/mobile/"> Mobile</a>,<a href="https://desktop.github.com/"> Desktop</a>, and<a href="https://github.com/cli/cli"> CLI</a> to collaborate anywhere;</li>
<li>And many other features and improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re also building many of our features iteratively with the open source community, including the recent <a href="https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> beta. As customers have gotten used to us shipping new things, we’ve also heard you clearly tell us that you’d like more visibility into what we’re working on, what we’re going to be shipping, and when.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce the <a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap">GitHub public roadmap</a>. The public roadmap is designed to give your team more information about what features and functionality you can expect from GitHub over the coming quarters. With more transparency into what we’re building, you can also plan better and share feedback earlier to influence what we’re building.</p>
<h2 id="what-were-launching">What we’re launching<a href="#what-were-launching" aria-label="What we’re launching" data-anchorjs-icon="#"></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap">GitHub public roadmap</a> is a new public repository on GitHub that anyone can access. There, you’ll find a project board that lays out upcoming releases. Each item on the board links to a detailed issue with more information about what we’re planning, why it’s important, when we expect to deliver it, and a bit about how we expect it to work.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/github-product-roadmap.png?resize=1024%2C522" alt="GitHub Product Roadmap" width="640" height="326" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/github-product-roadmap.png?resize=1024%2C522?w=1277 1277w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/github-product-roadmap.png?resize=1024%2C522?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/github-product-roadmap.png?resize=1024%2C522?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/github-product-roadmap.png?resize=1024%2C522?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>For example, if you filter the project board using the “beta”, “server”, and “security &amp; compliance” labels you’ll see which quarter we plan to bring code scanning and secret scanning to GitHub Enterprise Server in beta. You can also watch the repository or subscribe to individual roadmap issues to be notified about changes directly within GitHub.</p>

<p>Historically, GitHub has shared forward-looking product announcements at major events or in the occasional blog post, and we’ll continue to do this. While the public roadmap isn’t exhaustive, it will include most aspects of our product plans, and will be regularly updated.</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments, share them publicly on the <a href="https://github.community/">GitHub Community Forum</a> or privately via the <a href="https://support.github.com/contact/feedback">Share feedback</a> page, as you already do today. We look forward to keeping you informed and to hearing your feedback about what’s on the roadmap.</p>
<p>Besides the content of the roadmap being updated regularly, we’re also planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself. We see the potential of reactions, issue comments, and even <a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/104">GitHub Discussions</a> being valuable additions to the repository for receiving direct signals back from the community about what we’ve planned. If you have feedback about the roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through this <a href="https://support.github.com/contact/feedback?category=other&amp;subject=GitHub+public+roadmap">Share feedback</a> page.</p>
