These studies have focused largely on the inequality of outcomes resulting from inequities in the peer review process. While these studies have been invaluable for uncovering trends and patterns and increasing awareness of existing biases, they do not specifically assess the content of the reviews (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Perceptions%20of%20ethical%20problems%20with%20scientific%20journal%20peer%20review:%20an%20exploratory%20study&amp;author=Resnik&amp;publication_year=2008" title="Perceptions of ethical problems with scientific journal peer review: an exploratory study" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-30">Resnik, Gutierrez-Ford &amp; Peddada, 2008</a>), the downstream effects that unfair, biased and <i>ad hominem</i> comments may have on authors and how these reviewer comments may perpetuate representation gaps in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.</p><p id="p-2">In the traditional peer review process, the content, tone and thoroughness of a manuscript review is the sole responsibility of the reviewer (the identity of whom is often protected by anonymity), yet the contextualization and distribution of reviews to authors is performed by the assigned (handling) editor at the journal to which the paper was submitted. In this tiered system, journal editors are largely considered responsible for policing reviewer comments and are colloquially referred to as the “gatekeepers” of peer review. Both reviewers and editors are under considerable time pressures to move manuscripts through peer review, often lack compensation commensurate with time invested, experience heavy workloads and are subject to inherent biases of their own, which may translate into irrelevant and otherwise unprofessional comments being first written and then passed along to authors (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11948-015-9625-5" title="Ensuring the quality, fairness, and integrity of journal peer review: a possible role of editors" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-29">Resnik &amp; Elmore, 2016</a>; <a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Perceptions%20of%20ethical%20problems%20with%20scientific%20journal%20peer%20review:%20an%20exploratory%20study&amp;author=Resnik&amp;publication_year=2008" title="Perceptions of ethical problems with scientific journal peer review: an exploratory study" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-30">Resnik, Gutierrez-Ford &amp; Peddada, 2008</a>).</p><p id="p-3">We surveyed STEM scientists that have submitted manuscripts to a peer-reviewed journal as first author to understand the impacts of receiving unprofessional peer review comments on the perception of scientific aptitude (confidence as a scientist), productivity (publications per year) and career advancement (ability to advance within the field). This study defined an unprofessional peer review comment as any statement that is unethical or irrelevant to the nature of the work; this includes comments that: (1) lack constructive criticism, (2) are directed at the author(s) rather than the nature or quality of the work, (3) use personal opinions of the author(s)/work rather than evidence-based criticism, or (4) are “mean-spirited” or cruel (e.g., of comments received by survey respondents that fit these criteria see <a class="xref xref-fig" href="#fig-1" data-jats-ref-type="fig" data-jats-rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). The above definition was provided as a guideline for survey respondents to separate frank, constructive and even harsh reviews from those that are blatantly inappropriate or irrelevant. Specifically, this study aimed to understand the content of the unprofessional peer reviews, the frequency at which they are received and the subsequent impacts on the recipient’s perception of their abilities. Given that psychological studies show that overly harsh criticisms can lead to diminished success (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://doi.org/10.1037%2F0021-9010.73.2.199" title="Negative effects of destructive criticism: impact on conflict, self-efficacy, and task performance" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-2">Baron, 1988</a>), we tested for the effects of unprofessional peer review on the perception of scientific aptitude, productivity and career advancement of all respondents. Underrepresented groups in particular are vulnerable to stereotype threat, wherein negative societal stereotypes about performance abilities and aptitude are internalized and subsequently expressed (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Expectations%20of%20brilliance%20underlie%20gender%20distributions%20across%20academic%20disciplines&amp;author=Leslie&amp;publication_year=2015" title="Expectations of brilliance underlie gender distributions across academic disciplines" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-27">Leslie et al., 2015</a>). Further, the combination of social categorizations may lead to amplified sources of oppression and stereotype threat (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://doi.org/10.2307%2F1229039" title="Mapping the margins: intersectionality, identity politics, and violence against women of color" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-9">Crenshaw, 1991</a>); therefore, it is necessary to assess the impacts of unprofessional peer review comments across intersectional gender and racial/ethnic groups.</p><figure class="fig" itemprop="image" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="fig-1"><figcaption itemprop="description"><h3 class="heading"><span class="caption-label">Figure 1: </span>Examples of unprofessional peer reviews from survey respondents.</h3><span class="p">Permission to publish these comments was explicitly given by respondents who certified the comments were reported accurately.</span></figcaption></figure></section><section class="sec" id="materials|methods"><h2 class="heading">Materials and Methods</h2><section class="sec"><h3 class="heading">Survey methods and administration</h3><p id="p-5">The data for this study came from an anonymous survey of international members of the STEM community using Qualtrics survey software. Data were collected under institutional review board agreements and federalwide assurance at Occidental College (IRB00009103, FWA00005302) and California State University, Northridge (IRB00001788, FWA00001335). The survey was administered between 28 February 2019 and 10 May 2019 using the online-based platform in English and was open to anyone self-identifying as a member of the STEM community that published their scholarly work in a peer reviewed system. Participation in the survey was voluntary and no compensation or incentives were offered. All respondents had to certify that they were 18 years or older and read the informed consent statement; participants were able to exit the survey at any point without consequence. Participants were recruited broadly through social media platforms, direct posting on scientific list-serves and email invitations to colleagues, department chairs and organizations focused on diversity and inclusive practices in STEM fields (see <a class="xref xref-supplementary-material" href="#supplemental-information" data-jats-ref-type="supplementary-material" data-jats-rid="supplemental-information">Supplemental Files</a> for distribution methods). Targeted emails were used to increase representation of respondents. Data on response rates from specific platforms were not collected.</p><p id="p-6">The survey required participants to provide basic demographic information including gender identity, level of education, career stage, country of residence, field of expertise and racial and/or ethnic identities (see <a class="xref xref-supplementary-material" href="#supplemental-information" data-jats-ref-type="supplementary-material" data-jats-rid="supplemental-information">Supplemental Files</a> for specific survey questions). Throughout the entire survey, all response fields included “<i>I prefer not to say</i>” as an opt-out choice. Once demographic information was collected from participants, the study’s full definition of an unprofessional peer review was presented and respondents self-identified whether they had ever received a peer review comment as first author that fit this definition. Survey respondents answering “<i>no</i>” or “<i>I prefer not to say</i>” were automatically redirected to the end of the survey, as no additional questions were necessary. Respondents answering “<i>yes</i>” were asked a series of follow-up questions designed to determine the nature of the unprofessional comments, the total number of scholarly publications to date and the number of independent times an unprofessional review was experienced.</p><p id="p-7">The perceived impact of the unprofessional reviews on the scientific aptitude, productivity and career advancement of each respondent was assessed using the following questions: (1) To what degree did the unprofessional peer review(s) make you doubt your scientific aptitude? (1–5) 1 = not at all, 5 = I fully doubted my scientific abilities; (2) To what degree do you feel that receiving the unprofessional review(s) limited your overall productivity? Please rate this from 1 to 5. 1 = not at all, 5 = greatly limited number of publications per year; (3) To what degree do you feel that receiving the unprofessional review(s) delayed career advancement? Please rate this from 1 to 5. 1 = not at all, 5 = greatly impacted/delayed career advancement. Finally, respondents were invited to provide direct quotes of unprofessional reviews received (although the respondents were told they could remove any personal or identifying information such as field of study, pronouns, etc.). Participants choosing to share peer review quotes were able to specify whether they gave permission for the quote to be shared/distributed. Explicit permission from each respondent was received to use and distribute all quotes displayed in <a class="xref xref-fig" href="#fig-1" data-jats-ref-type="fig" data-jats-rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</a>. At the end of the survey, all respondents were required to certify that all the information provided was true and accurate to the best of their abilities and that the information was shared willingly.</p><p id="p-8">We recognize that there are limitations to our survey design. First, our survey was only administered in English. There also may have been non-response bias for individuals who did not experience negative comments during peer review even though any advertisement of this survey indicated that we sought input from anyone who has ever published a peer-reviewed study as first author. There could also be a temporal element, where authors who received comments more recently may have responded differently than those who received unprofessional reviews many years ago. Additionally, the order of questions was not randomized and participants were asked to complete demographic information before answering questions about their peer review experience, which may have primed respondents to select answers that were more in line with racial or gender-specific stereotypes (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jesp.2005.06.003" title="“Math is hard!” the effect of gender priming on women’s attitudes" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-32">Steele &amp; Ambady, 2006</a>). In order to maintain the anonymity of our respondents, we did not ask for any bibliometric data from the authors. Given that our sample of respondents represented a diverse array of career stages, STEM fields, countries of residence and racial/ethnic identities, we do not believe that any of the above significantly limits the interpretation of our results.</p></section><section class="sec"><h3 class="heading">Data analysis</h3><p id="p-9">We tested for the pervasiveness and downstream effects of unprofessional peer reviews on four intersecting gender and racial/ethnic groups: (1) women of color and non-binary people of color, (2) men of color, (3) white women and white non-binary people and (4) white men. Due to the small number of respondents identifying as non-binary (&lt;1% of respondents), we statistically analyzed women and non-binary genders together in a category as marginalized genders in the sciences. However, refer to <a class="xref xref-supplementary-material" href="#supp-1" data-jats-ref-type="supplementary-material" data-jats-rid="supp-1">Table S1</a> for full breakdown of responses from each gender identity so that patterns may be assessed by readers without the constraints conferred by statistical assumptions and analyses. To protect the anonymity of individuals that may be personally identified based on the combination of their race/ethnicity and gender, respondents who identified as a race or ethnicity other than white, including those who checked multiple racial and/or ethnic categories were grouped together for the statistical analysis (<a class="xref xref-supplementary-material" href="#supp-1" data-jats-ref-type="supplementary-material" data-jats-rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</a>). It is important to note that by grouping the respondents into four categories, the analysis captures only the broad patterns for intersectional groups and does not relay the unique experiences of each respondent, which should not be discounted.</p><p id="p-10">Survey respondents (<i>N</i> = 1,106) were given the opportunity to opt out of any question; therefore, the sample sizes were different for each statistical analysis. We tested for differences in the probability of receiving an unprofessional peer review across four intersectional groups (<i>N</i> = 1,077) using a Bayesian logistic regression (family = Bernoulli, link = logit). Of the 642 people who indicated that they received an unprofessional peer review, 617, 620 and 618 answered the questions regarding perceived impacts to their scientific aptitude, productivity and career advancement, respectively. We ran individual Bayesian ordinal logistic regressions (family = cumulative, link = logit) for each of the three questions to test for differences in probabilities of selecting a 1–5 across the four groups.

The difficulty in publishing and lack of productivity may contribute to the high attrition rate of women in academia (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.tree.2012.10.014" title="Is publication rate an equal opportunity metric?" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-7">Cameron, Gray &amp; White, 2013</a>).</p><p id="p-20">Assessment of intersectional groups has been generally overlooked in research on publication and peer review biases. Yet, traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups experience substantial pressures and limitations to inclusion in STEM fields. Indeed, in our study there were significant differences, especially in perceived delays in career advancement, between white women and white non-binary people, and women of color and non-binary people of color (<a class="xref xref-fig" href="#fig-3" data-jats-ref-type="fig" data-jats-rid="fig-3">Fig. 3C</a>). Had we focused on only gender or racial differences, the distinct experiences of women of color and non-binary people of color would have been obscured. Because both gender and racial biases lead to diminished recruitment and retention, as well as higher rates of attrition in the sciences (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11162-008-9097-4" title="Gender disparity in STEM disciplines: a study of faculty attrition and turnover intentions" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-38">Xu, 2008</a>; <a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1523422318814551" title="Advancing women of color in STEM: an imperative for U.S. global competitiveness" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-1">Alfred, Ray &amp; Johnson, 2019</a>), intersectionality cannot be ignored. Our results indicate that receiving unprofessional peer reviews is an yet another barrier to equity in career trajectories for women of color and non-binary people of color, in addition to the quality of mentorship, intimidation and harassment, lack of representation and many others (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03075079.2014.929102" title="Barriers to women leaders in academia: tales from science and technology" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-21">Howe-Walsh &amp; Turnbull, 2014</a>; <a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://doi.org/10.3102%2F0002831214563063" title="Don’t leave us behind’ the importance of mentoring for underrepresented minority faculty" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-39">Zambrana et al., 2015</a>).</p><p id="p-21">Our study indicates that unprofessionalism in reviewer comments is pervasive in STEM fields. Although we found clear patterns indicating that unprofessional peer reviewer comments had a stronger negative impact on underrepresented intersectional groups in STEM, all groups had at least some members reporting the highest level of impact in every category. This unprofessional behavior often occurs under the cloak of anonymity and is being perpetuated by the scientific community upon its members. Comments like several received by participants in our study (see <a class="xref xref-fig" href="#fig-1" data-jats-ref-type="fig" data-jats-rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</a>) have no place in the peer review process. Interestingly, less than 3% of our participants that received an unprofessional peer review stated that the review was from an open review journal, where the peer reviews and responses from authors are published with the final manuscript (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Transparency%20showcases%20strength%20of%20peer%20review&amp;author=Pulverer&amp;publication_year=2010" title="Transparency showcases strength of peer review" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-41">Pulverer, 2010</a>). While a recent laboratory study showed that open peer review practices led to higher cooperation and peer review accuracy (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Cooperation%20between%20referees%20and%20authors%20increases%20peer%20review%20accuracy&amp;author=Leek&amp;publication_year=2011" title="Cooperation between referees and authors increases peer review accuracy" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-40">Leek, Taub &amp; Pineda, 2011</a>), less is known about how transparent review practices affect professionalism in peer review comments. Our data indicate that open reviews may help curtail unprofessional comments, but more research on this topic is needed.</p><p id="p-22">Individual scientists have the power and responsibility to address the occurrence of unprofessional peer reviews directly and enact immediate change. We therefore recommend the following: (1) Make peer review mentorship an active part of student and peer learning. For example, departments and scientific agencies should hold workshops on peer review ethics. (2) Follow previously published best practices in peer review (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://doi.org/10.3352%2Fjeehp.2008.5.5" title="Peer review and manuscript management in scientific journals: guidelines for good practice" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-22">Huh &amp; Sun, 2008</a>; <a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.tips.2014.06.005" title="Threats to objectivity in peer review: the case of gender" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-23">Kaatz, Gutierrez &amp; Carnes, 2014</a>). (3) Practice self-awareness and interrogate whether comments are constructive and impartial (additionally, set aside enough time to review thoroughly, assess relevance and re-read any comments). (4) Encourage journals that do not already have explicit guidelines for the review process to create a guide, as well as implement a process to reprimand or remove reviewers that are acting in an unprofessional manner. For example, the journal could contact the reviewer’s department chair or senior associate if they submit an unprofessional review. (5) Societies should add acceptable peer review practices to their code of conduct and a structure that reprimands or removes society members that submit unprofessional peer reviews. (6) Editors should be vigilant in preventing unprofessional reviews from reaching authors directly and follow published best practices (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Can%20editors%20save%20peer%20review%20from%20peer%20reviewers?&amp;author=D%E2%80%99Andrea&amp;publication_year=2017" title="Can editors save peer review from peer reviewers?" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-11">D’Andrea &amp; O’Dwyer, 2017</a>; <a class="xref xref-bibr" href="https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11948-015-9625-5" title="Ensuring the quality, fairness, and integrity of journal peer review: a possible role of editors" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="ref-29">Resnik &amp; Elmore, 2016</a>). (7) When in doubt use the “golden rule” (review others as you wish to be reviewed).</p></section><section class="sec" id="conclusions"><h2 class="heading">Conclusions</h2><p id="p-23">Our study shows that unprofessional peer reviews are pervasive and that they disproportionately harm underrepresented groups in STEM. Specifically, underrepresented groups were most likely to report direct negative impacts on their scientific aptitude, productivity and career advancement after receiving an unprofessional peer review. While it was beyond the scope of this study, future investigations should also focus on the effect of unprofessional peer reviews on first-generation scientists English as a second language, career stage, peer review in grants, and other factors that could lead to differences in downstream effects. Unprofessional peer reviews have no place in the scientific process and individual scientists have the power and responsibility to enact immediate change. However, we recognize and applaud those reviewers and editors (and there are many!) that spend a significant amount of time and effort writing thoughtful, constructive, and detailed criticisms that are integral to moving science forward.</p></section><section class="sec" id="supplementary-material"><h2 class="heading">Supplemental Information</h2></section></div></div></div></div>
