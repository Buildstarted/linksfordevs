		<p>Today marks the date in 1865 when General Gordon Granger read General Order 3 to the people of Galveston Bay, Texas, informing the enslaved there and in all of Texas of freedom that had been rightfully theirs two years earlier. &nbsp;That was essentially the full extent of my understanding of Juneteenth until recently, so I’ve taken the additional time off my employer gave us today to dig a bit deeper. &nbsp;<a href="http://juneteenth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juneteenth.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Wikipedia entry about Juneteenth</a>, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/what-is-juneteenth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this explainer</a> by Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. have been my starting points. &nbsp;I shared these links with my direct reports as well as my co-workers before our 2PM close today, and was heartened by how generously they were received.</p>
<p>In today’s national discussions of and writing about Juneteenth, the role of Texas and black Texans doesn’t get nearly the prominence it should. &nbsp;Even as someone who has read <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/190696/the-warmth-of-other-suns-by-isabel-wilkerson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Warmth of Other Suns</a>, and the way that aspects of black southern culture migrated north and west out of the South along with its people, it didn’t occur to me that holidays would or could migrate too. &nbsp;Once I looked at the map of dates when different states granted it official recognition however, it made sense that Minnesota and Florida were among the first states outside of Texas to grant that recognition before the year 2000. &nbsp;In reading a story <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/18/texas-is-birthplace-juneteenth-many-residents-downplay-its-role-slavery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like this one</a>, it reinforces yet again that we in this country are fundamentally miseducated about its history when it comes to the Civil War, Reconstruction, its failure, and the consequences of that failure.</p>
<p>Even a widely-acclaimed documentary like Ken Burns’ <a href="http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/civil-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Civil War</a>–which my high school classmates and I watched parts of in history class on VHS after each episode aired–can’t convey just how determined some in this country were to preserve the institution of slavery. &nbsp;Only in reading about Juneteenth did I learn of plantation owners and other slaveholders migrating to Texas and bringing those they enslaved along with them to escape the fighting (and leveraging their distance from Union troops to extract years of additional labor from them). &nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/abfrancois/status/1273993135237054471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This thread</a> by Aderson B. Francois, professor of law at Georgetown University, tells a story I definitely did not know about concerted efforts&nbsp;<strong>to make it unconstitutional to abolish slavery</strong>. &nbsp;Not only was the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corwin_Amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corwin Amendment</a> passed by both houses of Congress by the necessary margin to proceed to ratification, not only did Abraham Lincoln support it, but my home state was among five that ratified it (and only rescinded that ratification in 2014). &nbsp;Thanks to a friend I met back in grad school, I learned that some of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-us-confederacy-americana-brazil-2017-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defeated Confederates attempted to preserve the Confederacy in Brazil</a>.</p>
<p>Spending the time to learn more about Juneteenth has unearthed quite a few things done in previous years to focus attention on it, and the story of black people in this country more generally. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/juneteenth-america-can-shine-light-its-dark-past/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This interview with Isabel Wilkerson</a>&nbsp;from 2017 leads off with audio from the 1940s housed at the Library of Congress from a formerly-enslaved woman old enough to remember the original Juneteenth, and reflects upon the death of Philando Castile at the hands of police in the previous year. &nbsp;<a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog-post/historical-legacy-juneteenth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This piece</a> on the National Museum of African American History and Culture website talks about the legacy of Juneteenth. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.history.com/news/what-is-juneteenth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A brief story from The History Channel</a> originally published in 2015 talks about the Emancipation Proclamation and Juneteenth. &nbsp;I’m not sure how many other holidays have their own flag, but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/us/freedom-day-juneteenth-flag-meaning-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juneteenth does</a>&nbsp;and has for over 20 years.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing Juneteenth has done in the wake of George Floyd’s murder is spark good faith questions from white friends and co-workers about aspects of black history in the United States. &nbsp;While my heritage makes <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/not-all-black-people-are-african-american-what-is-the-difference/?fbclid=IwAR1zqI0Ggc7NwgAW0j_vhAMy3dW5K6ohOvtvbNVv3TuxUqHZ8NSL4zQG0Jc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my connection to the term “black”</a> more complicated, I refer friends to documentaries like <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80091741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13th</a>, and to the scholarship of <a href="https://sanford.duke.edu/people/faculty/darity-jr-william" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. William Darity</a> to learn more about reparations.</p>
<p>In addition to spending at least a part of today learning more, I donated to two non-profits and encouraged friends to do so as well. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.innocenceproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Innocence Project</a> works to free those wrongly convicted of crimes. &nbsp;The <a href="https://eji.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equal Justice Initiative</a> operates The Legacy Museum and The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which seek to educate about the history of enslavement, lynching, and mass incarceration of black Americans in the United States. &nbsp;Perhaps this Juneteenth will be the beginning of an annual tradition of learning and contributing to the cause of justice.</p>
