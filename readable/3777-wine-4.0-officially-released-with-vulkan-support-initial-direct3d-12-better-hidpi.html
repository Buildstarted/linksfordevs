</p><p>Following seven weekly release candidates, Wine 4.0 was ready to ship today as judged by Wine founder Alexandre Julliard. Wine 4.0 is a big release bringing initial Vulkan graphics API support, Direct3D CSMT is enabled by default, early Direct3D 12 support via VKD3D, continued HiDPI work, various OpenGL improvements, multi-sample D3D texture support, 64-bit improvements, continued Android support, and much more... See our <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Wine-4.0-Feature-Overview">Wine 4.0 feature overview</a> to learn more about this big update.
</p><p>The very brief Wine 4.0 release announcement can be read on <a href="https://www.winehq.org/news/2019012201">WineHQ.org</a>.
</p><p>The bi-weekly Wine 4.x development releases will now commence with Git master back open for feature development, culminating with Wine 5.0 next year. Hopefully Valve's Proton will soon be re-based to the current Wine 4.0 state.</p></div></div></div></div>
