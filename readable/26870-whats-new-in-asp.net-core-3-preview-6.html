While a lot of the articles seem to be focusing on the non-ASP.NET features (e.g. WPF, WinForms, etc.), I thought it would be nice to let those of you who are ASP.NET devs know what is in Preview 6 just for you.</p><p>It feels a lot like the ASP.NET MVC/API side is being treated as mature and stable as there is are not a lot of surface changes. Microsoft does seem to be doubling down on Razor Pages and Blazor. It feels like they want .NET Core to be a good fit for different styles and backgrounds of developer. This release is no different.</p><p>Let's take a look at the details:</p><ul><li><strong>@attribute</strong>: Let's you add attributes usage in your Razor files (more common in .razor components than in .cshtml files)</li><li><strong>@code</strong>: Equivalent to @functions feature. Only supported in .razor file components. Used to add code blocks.</li><li><strong>@key</strong>: Used to help Blazor optimize handling lists of components so that it knows a key to know what to replace or where to insert new objects in a Blazor view.</li><li>Blazor attributes have been standardized to a format of <strong>@directive(-suffix(:name))(=value)</strong></li><li>Blazor templates now support Authentication and Authorization</li></ul><h3 id="json-support">JSON Support</h3><p>By default, all ASP.NET Core projects will use System.Text.Json by default. You can still opt into JSON.NET by using:</p><pre><code>  services.AddMvc()
    .AddNewtonsoftJson();
</code></pre><h3 id="security-changes">Security Changes</h3><p>Preview 6 now supports Certificate and Kerberos authentiation and authorization. For example:</p><pre><code>    services.AddAuthentication(
        CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
            .AddCertificate();
</code></pre><p>This opens ASP.NET Core to more security requirements.  I'm excited to see this.</p><h3 id="signalr">SignalR</h3><p>By opting into the new client-side <strong>@aspnet/signalr@next</strong> you'll be able to add auto reconnection via opting into it in your SignalR projects:</p><pre><code>const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/chatHub")
    .withAutomaticReconnect()
    .build();
</code></pre><p>This will reconnect at 2, 10 and 30 second intervals. You can customize these timings too.</p><h3 id="grpc">gRPC</h3><p>gRPC now has a completely managed client. So if you're building .NET end-to-end via a gRPC endpoint, you can now do this much easier with both a managed client and a client factory. I see gRPC as a good replacement for WCF's non-http services. If you haven't looked at gRPC yet, it's an interesting technology if you're not expecting a variety of clients. SignalR is built via gRPC under the covers. And yes, gRPC is an open spec, not a Microsoft invention. See an overview at <a href="https://grpc.io/docs/guides/">https://grpc.io/docs/guides/</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>
