<p>Rider 2020.2 is now available! To mark this great news we’ve put together a full list of the new features and under the hood improvements that are in store for you. Let’s dive in!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/?utm_medium=blog_post" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i><br>
Download Rider 2020.2</a></p>
<h3>Debugger</h3>
<div><p>The new release brings significant changes to the debugger API. They allow us to perform super-lazy value calculations with better interruption and custom value representation. We’ve also added data breakpoints.</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_01-4.png" alt=""></p><p>

Finally, the Pin to Frame feature lets you pin local variables to the frame.</p></div>
<h3>Localization Manager</h3>
<div><p>We’re proud to introduce a new tool for working with resources. With the Localization Manager, you can view the content of any specified set of .resx files in your project, including all of them at once, in a single grid.</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_02-1.png" alt=""></p><p>

The Localization Manager allows you to easily perform the whole set of operations on resources: add, edit, rename, safely delete, find unused, find the resources missing localized values, find usages, export to and import from CSV, and add comments.</p></div>
<h3>Unity</h3>
<div><p>Unity support has received a major boost. Cg and HLSL shaders are now supported in syntax highlighting, code completion, navigation (including macros), refactorings, and more.</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_03-1.png" alt=""></p><p>

Pausepoints, which pause the Unity Editor when the debugger hits them, are now available. Rider now works with the Burst compiler, which means it highlights code that doesn’t match Burst constraints. For the whole list of improvements, <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-unity/blob/net202/CHANGELOG.md">check out this list</a>.</p></div>
<h3>VCS support</h3>
<div><p>The main attraction here is the enhanced support for GitHub pull requests, which includes browsing, assigning, and merging pull requests, as well as submitting comments and reviews, accepting changes, and more. For more details, please check out <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/05/intellij-idea-2020-2-early-access-program-is-starting/#version_control">this blog post</a>.</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_04-1.png" alt=""></p><p>

Additionally, Git in WSL 2 is now supported, Compare branches are presented more conveniently, and you can squash commits selected in the Log tab of the Git tool window.</p></div>
<h3>Unit testing</h3>
<p>Our unit test runner has been rebuilt from scratch for both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This has helped us solve a lot of known problems with discovering, running, and debugging unit tests. The new runner includes built-in support for <em>MSFakes</em> for NUnit, xUnit and MSTest v2, along with the ability to run MSTest v2 tests without Visual Studio installed. There are also UI improvements for better presentation and filtering.</p>
<h3>NuGet</h3>
<div><p>The NuGet tool window has received a considerable feature boost. It now displays a solution’s transitive packages, provides a context menu with all the relevant actions for a single package, and indicates invalid feeds and deprecated packages.</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_05-1.png" alt=""></p></div>
<h3>Code analysis</h3>
<div><p>C# 8 support has been enhanced with a number of new inspections and quick-fixes, most notably for nullable reference types. For instance, code analysis now takes into account <em>JetBrains.Annotations</em> attributes (both <code>NotNull</code> and <code>CanBeNull</code>) for API declared in code where nullable reference types are disabled (<code>#nullable disable</code>).</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_06-1.png" alt=""></p><p>

Also, nullability code analysis is now aware of more cases and can trace incorrect nullability through <em>deconstruction</em> and the <code>foreach</code> cycle, and it provides a corresponding quick-fix.</p></div>
<h3>Refactorings</h3>
<div><p>The Introduce Parameter and Introduce Field refactorings now ask which part of the expression you want the refactoring to be applied to.</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_07-1.png" alt=""></p><p>

The Conflicts dialog has received a makeover: we’ve turned the plain list into a tree grouped by file.</p></div>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<div><p>The Markdown plugin is now bundled in Rider. It recognizes Markdown files in your solution, provides a dedicated editor for them, and shows the rendered HTML in a live preview.</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_08-1.png" alt=""></p><p>

With Azure Toolkit and Azurite, you can now start, stop, and clear the storage emulator in the Azurite node of the Services tool window. Also, code completion and validation is now available when editing NCrontab expressions.</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_09-1.png" alt=""></p><p>

The dotCover plugin offers export of coverage reports, quick search in Unit Tests Coverage window, and navigation from code to the coverage tree.</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_10-1.png" alt=""></p><p>

The dotTrace plugin can profile the native parts of Mono/Unity applications on Windows.</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_12-1.png" alt=""></p><p>

Godot run configurations have been reworked to make it easier to launch run, debug, and run with profiling.</p><p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_11-1.png" alt=""></p></div>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_16-1.gif" alt=""></p></li>
<li>We’ve made some improvements to database support, such as a separate editor for huge cell values, a new UI for boolean values, and a DML preview in the data editor.<p>

<img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RD_release_17-1.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li>For web developers, we have new smart intentions in JavaScript code, in-text rendering of documentation comments, support for the Prettier plugin, and more updates to Vue support.<p>
