    <p>I promised two things when I did the closing keynote at RustConf 2018:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I will put the slides for the talk online</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will post the long-form version of the talk on a my blog</p>

    <p>2.a. I will actually make a blog for this purpose</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>‚Ä¶and I have taken my damn sweet time doing so.  Finally, I have done what I
promised I would do!</p>

<p>If you haven‚Äôt seen it and would like to, you can see the live talk that I did
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKLntZcp27M">here</a>.</p>

<p>The slides for the talk (with a small errata) are now hosted
<a href="https://kyren.github.io/rustconf_2018_slides/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>So, I said in my talk that I would post a potentially more interesting long-form
version of the talk that includes things that I couldn‚Äôt fit into the 30-ish
minute time slot.  What I‚Äôve included below is my original long-form version of
this talk, but my original intention was not to post this as-is.  Originally I
wanted to clean this up a bit more and make this into something that wasn‚Äôt so
much a giant wall of text, but after I started doing this I realized that I was
just rewriting it entirely, and at that rate I would never get around to
releasing it, which I <em>promised</em> I would do in a timely manner.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not super happy with this, and in retrospect I think many of the things I
cut for the 30-ish minute talk were probably wise to cut.  I think the parts
about console development are wildly speculative and not that helpful, and the
part at the end about language boundaries being particularly difficult is,
while true, kind of beside the point.  However, people seemed very interested
and are (very rightly) reminding me that I haven‚Äôt posted this yet, so rather
than delay any further I‚Äôm going to give you the very lightly edited text
version of the talk that I made.  Keep in mind this was before I realized I
would NEVER fit this into 30 minutes :).  This is written in a very informal,
conversational style because this was intended as the source material for my
talk.</p>

<p>Without further ado‚Ä¶</p>

<hr>



<p>This is a very rough outline of the things I‚Äôd like to talk about in my RustConf
2018 keynote.</p>

<p>This talk assumes that you know a bit of C++ in addition to a bit of Rust, and
there are quite a lot of C++ code samples, but I hope they‚Äôre obvious enough not
to be distracting to the people who might not be used to C++.</p>

<h2 id="basic-thesis-of-the-talk">Basic thesis of the talk:</h2>

<p>Rust, by design, makes certain programming patterns more painful than others.
This is a GOOD thing!  It turns out that, for game development, the patterns
that end up being the easiest to deal with in Rust closely mirror the patterns
that are easiest for game development in <em>any</em> language.</p>

<p>I unfortunately had to learn this the HARD way!</p>

<p>Rust highly rewards data-oriented design with simple, understandable ownership
semantics, and this is great news because this is a really good fit for game
development.  I suspect this is also true generally, not just for game
development! (but what do I know?)</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-listen-to-me-who-am-i">Why should you listen to me, who am I?</h2>

<p>I was the lead programmer for Starbound, I‚Äôve I was one of the first members of
Chucklefish back when we were all working over IRC.  I was the technical lead at
Chucklefish when we first decided that we should probably have somebody be
called the ‚Äútechnical lead‚Äù.  I still work with Chucklefish peripherally, but
I‚Äôve since moved back to the US and I work on things more independently now.</p>

<p>But, honestly not sure you SHOULD listen to me!  I‚Äôve helped release ONE (1)
whole commercial game, and some of this talk is a cautionary tale about what NOT
to do based on the ONE (1) commercial game I‚Äôve helped make.</p>

<p>I definitely feel like you shouldn‚Äôt make any‚Ä¶ real <em>grown up</em> business
decisions based on my advice.  I can‚Äôt say for sure that Rust is a good fit for
you, or whether you should or shouldn‚Äôt make your game in Rust, certainly there
are probably larger concerns depending on, if you‚Äôre an indie, what your
personal skill level and tolerances and preferences are, and if you‚Äôre a company
what tooling you need and what engines, middleware, etc you already use.</p>

<p>What I can say is that personally I will be using Rust for game development (and
other things!) for the foreseeable future, and if you‚Äôd like to hear why, or if
you‚Äôve already decided that you‚Äôd like to use Rust and would like to know what
you‚Äôre in for, then this talk may be useful.</p>

<p>This talk is going to be more‚Ä¶ vague than I‚Äôd prefer.  I‚Äôm generally more
comfortable giving people specific very technical advice where I can prove my
point almost from first principles, but things like architecture advice or
general advice are probably never going to be so clear cut.  I definitely think
it‚Äôs still <em>useful</em>, which is why I‚Äôm doing it (and people seem interested), but
remember: this is all just like, my opinion, man.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-even-make-a-game-in-rust">How do you EVEN make a game in Rust?</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve gotten a lot of questions over the past year or so that more or less ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you make a game from scratch in Rust?  No, seriously‚Ä¶ HOW.  I mean, I
can see how you can do it <em>in theory</em>, but for some reason when I try to apply
patterns that I‚Äôm used to from other languages I just hit lots of problems?
I‚Äôve heard that this is called ‚Äúfighting the borrow checker‚Äù, but‚Ä¶ that
doesn‚Äôt really seem to <em>help</em> me much.  What am I doing wrong?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, maybe it‚Äôs something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can see how rust is great if you like very strict control, I can see it
being used for small utilities or things where security is paramount, but it
seems very restrictive!  I don‚Äôt really see how you could make something large
like a game without running into these limitations.  How do you structure
something like a game without needing Rc&lt;RefCell<t>&gt; and Arc&lt;Mutex<t>&gt;
everywhere?</t></t></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These (straw man) questions are of course about games, but they also mirror
sentiments I‚Äôve seen about Rust in general.  In case it‚Äôs not obvious, I
disagree with this sentiment (I am at RustConf after all), and I think the best
way for me to talk about WHY I disagree with it is to talk about what I know,
so I‚Äôm going to come at this from the perspective of games.</p>

<p>The talk could just be me coming up to a podium and saying ‚ÄúJeez, it‚Äôs not that
difficult!  Data oriented design!  If you‚Äôre making a game, use an ECS! ‚Ä¶
Thank you.‚Äù and then walking off stage, and from a certain perspective I do
feel that it <em>can</em> be that simple, but I think there‚Äôs a more important
fundamental point here and that‚Äôs what this talk is about.  The very very short
answer to this question is: if you forget OO design and instead just
concentrate on the data representation of your game state (or whatever you‚Äôre
making), and you try hard not to make anything more complicated than it really
has to be, things can actually be pretty simple!  This talk will be working up
slowly to a simple ECS implementation in Rust and trying to give justifications
for each step, but not <em>all</em> the steps are necessary.  I don‚Äôt even think using
some specific design pattern like an ECS is essential, I think the more
important larger point is to let go of some habits that, at least <em>I</em> had that
make things more difficult than they need to be, and in Rust more so.</p>

<p>For some people the things that I say in this talk might be <em>blindingly
obvious</em>.  If this is all obvious to you, that‚Äôs wonderful, but this hasn‚Äôt
always been obvious to me.  In fact, part of the reason that I‚Äôm such a fan of
Rust is that I didn‚Äôt actually learn these lessons from trying to build a game
in Rust, I mostly learned them before I ever even tried Rust for the first time,
from mistakes that I made early in Starbound.  I need somebody to pick on to
demonstrate what NOT to do, so it‚Äôs really convenient that I have such a great
example in my past self.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm definitely going to repeat some advice that other people have given.  In
fact, some of these things are definitely widely known and have almost become
kind of truisms: Inheritance is bad, OO is mostly bad, ECS design is good, etc.
Hopefully to the extent that those <em>are</em> true I provide more evidence for them
and describe why these are especially important in the presence of the borrow
checker, but hopefully I can also add some nuance to these and this will be
helpful to other people who want to use Rust for game development.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-even-make-a-game-at-all">How do you EVEN make a game <em>at all</em></h2>

<p>Certainly a lot of these questions only appear when you‚Äôre trying to come up
with a game architecture from scratch, and certainly many people aren‚Äôt going to
actually do this.  In fact, generally the advice for indie developers is
that you should NEVER make your own engine, and if you use something like Unity
or Unreal to make your game, a lot of these decisions are going to be made for
you.</p>

<p>I definitely did NOT follow this advice.  In fact, I think Starbound ran
directly against every piece of advice you commonly give a new indie dev:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Don‚Äôt make your own engine
(Starbound is written basically in bare C++ on top of SDL / libogg /
libvorbis / libfreetype etc)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always make a prototype and plan to throw it away
(The code that I used to demo two weeks in is the same lineage as the 1.0
release)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seriously, don‚Äôt make your own engine, just use Unity / Unreal / Godot etc
(We didn‚Äôt even use boost!  In fact, at some point we added our own versions
of c++17 classes like std::optional and std::variant inside starbound,
because at the time it was easier than starting to depend on boost.  We also
came up with our own system for doing 2d texture atlasing because we
couldn‚Äôt find a good way to do offline texture atlasing with so many small
textures that can‚Äôt be easily grouped)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your first game should be simple, you should make something simple that you
can release in a short time.
(In starbound, you can have an item that the player holds that runs its own
Lua script which affects player physics, which can cooperate with other
items and abilities that the player has that have their own scripts that
also can affect the player‚Äôs physics (at the same time), while also giving
the player scripted status effects which can add their own custom stats to a
generic stat database that most entities have, which can have stacks of
generic stat modifiers also controllable from scripts.  There is also an
entire crappy sort of DSL for drawing material blocks that visually connect
in arbitrarily complicated ways.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôm definitely not trying to tell anybody to make ANYTHING like what I made as
my first commercial game, don‚Äôt follow in my footsteps, I don‚Äôt think I would
recommend that for anybody.  However, there are actually quite a lot of indie
devs who don‚Äôt use Unreal / Unity style game engines and instead of using these
‚Äúframework‚Äù style game engines instead go for more ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù style where they
simply use individual libraries for specific features, or use small
‚Äúframeworks‚Äù that provide mostly rendering, audio, and input, and create the
basic structure of the games they make themselves.  (I once had a porting house
call this ‚Äúold school‚Äù development style, MUCH to my dismay)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any game made with XNA or MonoGame.  XNA / MonoGame definitely provide a lot
in a single package (rendering, sound, input) but they don‚Äôt dictate the
architecture of the game itself.  This includes Terraria and Stardew Valley,
just to name two.</li>
  <li>Any game made by Jonathan Blow (Braid, The Witness)</li>
  <li>Any game made by Zach Barth (Zachtronics).  He has stated that when he
starts developing a game, he starts with a bare event loop (input / update /
render) and goes from there. (NOTE: I couldn‚Äôt find a source for this, so I
hope I‚Äôm not misrepresenting him, I think he said it in an interview that I
now can‚Äôt find)</li>
  <li>Any game made Supergiant (Bastion, Transistor, Pyre)</li>
  <li>Chucklefish games that are made 100% in house: Starbound obviously, also
Wargroove (made with the generic C++ engine halley, but the main dev for the
engine is the main dev of Wargroove).</li>
  <li>LOTS more that I‚Äôm not listing, many many many 2d games are made this way,
some 3d games as well.  There are <em>dozens</em> of us, I tell you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously the advice I give is not as applicable if you decide to use something
like Unity or Unreal, which if you do and that‚Äôs great and you‚Äôre happy, then
I‚Äôm not trying to convince you to leave that.  Obviously if you use one of
those, Rust is probably out of the question except for very very peripheral
things, but honestly I still think eventually Rust WILL find its way into these
sorts commercial mainstream game engine products, it‚Äôs just a matter of time.
For the moment though, the most likely people to use Rust and find this talk
useful are other start-from-scratch indie types, and maybe a few AAA studios
that make a lot of their own technology in house (Ready at Dawn!, EA SEED!).
Also, I‚Äôm convinced there‚Äôs going to be a Unity or UE competitor that uses Rust
sooner or later!</p>

<p>So okay, suppose you‚Äôve decided that you‚Äôre going to make a game, you‚Äôre NOT
going to be using one of the opinionated game engines that decide much of the
game structure for you like Unreal or Unity, and you‚Äôve decided to use Rust,
what would such a thing look like?</p>

<h2 id="how-games-were-made-in-the-past">How games were made in the past</h2>

<p>So, in the past, games were mostly engineered in a ‚Äúdata-oriented‚Äù way out of
sheer necessity.  There is not much room for abstraction when your target
console has 128KB of RAM (SNES).  I‚Äôm going to call this the ‚ÄúAction Replay‚Äù era
of video game development.  If you aren‚Äôt aware, these are cheating devices kind
of like ‚ÄúGame Genies‚Äù or ‚ÄúGame Sharks‚Äù if you know those, where you can patch a
game‚Äôs RAM state every frame.  The ‚ÄúGame Genie‚Äù and similar devices allowed you
to patch the ROM of the game cartridge, but the ‚ÄúAction Replay‚Äù devices actually
let you insert hooks into say, the VBlank handler, that overwrote actual memory
values at constant locations every frame to say give you infinite lives etc.</p>

<p>The reason this worked is because obviously with 128KB of RAM, you‚Äôre not
exactly going to have an implementation of malloc!.  Every byte of storage is
precious, so mostly games from this era are designed with very predictable
manually managed layouts for their entire game state in memory.  In the NES /
SNES era, there was so little memory that generally the graphical representation
of your game (tiles, sprites) and the logical representation of your game are
the same, and if you kind of squint you see ‚Äúentity‚Äù structures, but generally
the maximum number of ‚Äúthings‚Äù that the game can keep track of are so few that
there‚Äôs not enough room for any generality.  This is sometimes also known as the
‚Äúhealing power of off-screen‚Äù era of game development, because the moment you go
off screen, everything about that part of the game level is often forgotten (and
enemies are magically healed).</p>

<p>Imagine if you were to try to write a game for the NES in Rust (probably REALLY
hard, but not impossible?  No harder than C at least, which is equally really
hard.  I‚Äôm pretty sure basically all games from the SNES era are written
directly in assembler.), you might define a single static data structure
something like this completely made up example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>ProjectileType</span> <span>=</span> <span>u8</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>EnemyType</span> <span>=</span> <span>u8</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// etc...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can learn an enormous amount about how software works just by looking at its
data structures in this way, even if this is a pretend example.</p>

<p>One thing to note here is that since every SNES game was overwhelmingly likely
to be made in assembler, there almost certainly was no such thing as ‚Äúdata
hiding‚Äù, the entire state of the game is available at any point to the update
loop.</p>

<p>This era where every memory location was precious and objects were carefully
laid out in it actually lasted a huge amount of time, at least up to the N64.
Let‚Äôs look at another example which I‚Äôm moderately familiar with, and is still
solidly in this era, but whose design is imo much closer to modern game engines.
One of my all-time favorite games in the world: Mario 64.  Mario 64 is
interesting because it‚Äôs 3D, and except for the low-poly simple graphics, is it
really THAT much different from a modern 3D platformer?  Yet, it‚Äôs still solidly
in the ‚ÄúAction Replay‚Äù era of gaming, when you get into a ‚Äúgame world‚Äù (you can
run and jump around as Mario) you can reliably tell (more or less) where all the
level data is going to live in the N64‚Äôs expansive, luxurious 4 entire MB of
ram.  There‚Äôs a predictable block of memory for the level geometry, for lots of
various level flags, etc, but most of the dynamic content of the game is in the
form of generic ‚Äúentities‚Äù (or ‚Äúobjects‚Äù), much like modern game engines.  In
Mario 64, the entity structures are all exactly 608 bytes long, and there is a
hard limit to 240 of them (sometimes this is a bit less, like in Bowser in the
Fire Sea, there is a limit of 232 objects).</p>

<p>We don‚Äôt actually know what language Mario 64 was programmed in, but it was
<em>likely</em> C, so this is probably in the era where, if you had a time machine and
a burning desire for a better systems language from the future, you could just
as easily have used Rust to make a commercial Nintendo 64 game.  Let‚Äôs take a
lot of artistic liberty and imagine what the structure of such a game would look
like translated as directly as possible to Rust:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>EntityAnimation</span> <span>=</span> <span>u8</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>EntityBehavior</span> <span>=</span> <span>u8</span><span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Entity</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Is this entity initialized and active or is it dead and can be</span>
    <span>// overwritten.</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>initialized</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span>

    <span>// Okay, this is really interesting.  In Mario 64, all entities are divided</span>
    <span>// into "important" and "unimportant" entities.  Important entities are</span>
    <span>// things like mario himself, coins, enemies etc.  Unimportant entities are</span>
    <span>// things like wind effects or the stars that come out of mario's butt</span>
    <span>// stomp.  When the game runs out of entity slots, it will remove</span>
    <span>// unimportant entities to make room for important entities.  If the game</span>
    <span>// tries to create more than 240 important entities (or 232 in BitFS), it</span>
    <span>// will hang.</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>important</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span>
    
    <span>pub</span> <span>position</span><span>:</span> <span>Vector3</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>rotation</span><span>:</span> <span>Vector3</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>

    <span>// I think most things like this are pointers in real Mario 64, but they</span>
    <span>// could just as easily be indexes.  This turns out to be kind of important.</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>animation</span><span>:</span> <span>EntityAnimation</span><span>,</span>

<p>So, the specific details of these representations aren‚Äôt really super important,
the important takeaways here are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The representation of the game state (though it‚Äôs dramatically
over-simplified here) is still very <em>simple</em> even in the real game.  It‚Äôs
very predictable and amenable to RAM value poking, and there isn‚Äôt really
much in the way of ‚Äúabstraction‚Äù here, everything is quite literal and built
for purpose.</li>
  <li>We can‚Äôt know for sure about the languages used for all the games in the N64
era, but we know at least for some titles that it was definitely C (Shadows
of the Empire), and probably it was C in the vast majority of cases.  The
game structures all tended to be simple and predictable like Mario 64, you
can imagine the game state being represented mostly as global C structs or
arrays of structs.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm speculating here, but <em>probably</em> there was not much ‚Äúdata hiding‚Äù, you
can imagine the structure of these games more or less as a giant static
global struct containing ‚Äúall of the game state‚Äù, visible to all of the
game‚Äôs code.</li>
  <li>There are occasional pointers to functions, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a
whole lot of OO going on.  There don‚Äôt seem to be vtables, or even many
things <em>like</em> vtables, or anything like that.  This is potentially wild
speculation and is definitely just a non-expert opinion, but from my
‚Äúextensive‚Äù research into the memory layout and design of SNES - N64 era
titles, it usually feels like you can kind of imagine the very basic,
boring, made-for-purpose C code that the engine is made of just from looking
at the data format.</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so imagine you were to write Mario 64 very similarly to how it appears to
originally be designed, but in Rust.  You would effectively be writing a giant,
procedural, single purpose game engine in a much much nicer C, but still at its
heart, pretty much like C.  Effectively your game engine is something like

<p>So I‚Äôm NOT recommending that you make games this way!  However, even if you
think this is 100% a ridiculous over-simplification, or you think that even if
you could make a large complex game this way, it would turn into a procedural
ball of mud, let‚Äôs look at this for a while and see if there are any advantages
before we totally write this off.  Clearly there is a huge, gaping, obvious
disadvantage in that the entire game state is visible and mutable to all systems
and if something changes unexpectedly, you might have no idea where to look to
find what is changing the game state improperly.  Nobody is <em>really</em> suggesting
in the modern era that you write software with all state as effectively global.
HOWEVER there is one advantage here, which is that with a little bit of care,
you could write a game this way in 100% safe rust and almost definitely not run
into issues with the borrow checker.  You might not be able to use <em>pointers</em>
safely since <em>certainly</em> if you used pointers your entire game state would have
internal pointers to itself, so the one modification from Mario 64 style that we
need to make is that everywhere where there would have been a pointer, instead
store an index into some array.  The canonical example of this is the
‚Äúmario_entity‚Äù field on our GameState.  This may seem overly limiting, but with
a bit of thought it becomes clear especially if you had constant limits on
things (you don‚Äôt even have malloc, remember!), you can always add something
like <code>all_the_textures: [TextureDescriptor; 256]</code>, and use integer indexes into
this static array to describe textures instead of things like pointers.  The
other reason this is helpful w.r.t. the borrow checker is that Rust is rather
good at letting you split borrows for different fields of a public struct, so
since everything in our pretend-engine is just a giant nested tree of entirely
public structs, you should always be able to read the state of the game and
change exactly as much of the game as necessary in each system.  Remember, most
of the games in the ‚ÄúAction Replay‚Äù era are written like this, there is not
usually any malloc-ing, there is at most something very limited like
‚Äúallocating‚Äù only from a fixed array, and most everything is more or less
carefully laid out in a static struct somewhere.</p>

<p>One more criticism of this style is that you might say that using indexes
instead of pointers is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù in the strict sense, but possibly only
technically, you‚Äôre trading UB and potential crashes with pointers for ‚Äúrandom
but unspecified‚Äù behavior if you access the wrong or outdated index, and
potentially panics.  You‚Äôd be right, btw!  We‚Äôll visit this some more later, but
just accept for now that it‚Äôs possible and safe and this design doesn‚Äôt run
directly against the borrow checker.</p>

<p>Okay, so now I‚Äôve hopefully described an admittedly over-simplified way that you
COULD write a game in Rust that morally sort of closely mirrors the oldest game
architectures.  I‚Äôm not advocating this for your next game or anything, but
there ARE games written now that are little more than this, written in direct,
single purpose, procedural style.  I‚Äôm not going to call out specific games, but
I‚Äôve seen a bunch of games written in a style that is little more than this,
often wrapped in a paper thin veneer of OO.  I‚Äôve seen game source code that has
a single <strong>12k</strong> line world generation function.  This is not an insult to such
games, even marginally, the people who do this are often absolute geniuses who
are just very good at knowing what to care about and what not to care about.
There is real wisdom here!</p>

<p>But still, I‚Äôm genuinely not advocating this.  Let‚Äôs refer to this as the
‚ÄúUR-game-architecture‚Äù, and we‚Äôll come back to it.  This is approaching the
‚Äúdata-driven! use an ECS!‚Äù answer from the bottom up, let‚Äôs digress and approach
this now from the top down.</p>

<h2 id="wayyyyyyy-too-much-object-orientation">Wayyyyyyy too much object orientation</h2>

<p>Now that we‚Äôve covered sort of the simplest possible messy procedural C-ish game
engine design, let‚Äôs try to apply the principles of OO design and see if this is
an improvement.  I‚Äôm going to use Starbound or some simplification of Starbound
as an example here, because I‚Äôm lucky enough to know a lot about it and have its
source on hand, so I‚Äôm not going to be lying <em>too</em> much when I describe it.</p>

<p>What are the principles of OO?  Not everybody entirely agrees with what OO is,
but I‚Äôm including some basic hopefully non-controversial points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single responsibility principle - Objects should have a single logical set
of responsibilities, and methods should perform one operation inside that
set of responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Encapsulation - You should bind data together with the functions that
operate on it, keeping both safe from outside interference and misuse.  This
allows for refactoring by changing the internal representation of a class
without changing its behavior.</li>
  <li>Abstraction, or ‚ÄúLiskov Substitution Principle‚Äù, or similar - You should be
able to substitute one derived class for another, as long as they share the
same base and are used through that base class (or interface, or whatever).</li>
  <li>Interface segregation, or principle of least coupling, etc - The dependency
on one class to another should use the smallest possible interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>On a practical level, OO languages generally have a few important features to
support OO design, namely object methods, private object data, inheritance,
virtual methods, etc.  I‚Äôm mostly going to be talking about C++ because it has a
lot of OO footguns, it‚Äôs what I know, and it‚Äôs a super popular language for the
‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make my own engine‚Äù gamedev crowd.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre going to try these principles out and see how they can be misused for game
development, and then talk about how even though they often fail for gamedev
(and this is now a ‚Äúwell known‚Äù state of affairs), they fail <em>way more
spectacularly</em> with Rust.  It <em>is</em> possible to make a game with at least some of
these principles, though, and they‚Äôre not <em>all</em> actually universally terrible
ideas.  I‚Äôm not really a proponent of OO <em>at all</em>, but there are at least a few
good ideas that are sort of related to OO or kind of came out of OO (all of
which Rust has and can perform admirably).</p>

<ul>
  <li>The dot operator or ‚Äúpostfix functions‚Äù.  If you‚Äôre a haskeller this is
‚Äútype directed name resolution‚Äù as opposed to the normal state of affairs
which is ‚Äúname directed type resolution‚Äù.  A ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù way to avoid having
to scope 100 different functions with very short common names, or have C
style prefixes for everything.  Great for IDEs too!</li>
  <li>Interfaces with laws (contracts) - Rust traits!  No inheritance in sight,
and they‚Äôre best when they‚Äôre small and come with meaningful rules around
them, but if you squint they‚Äôre kind of C++ pure virtual classes.  They‚Äôre
<em>awesome</em> in the same way Haskell typeclasses are awesome.</li>
  <li>Data hiding - Being able to hide data to maintain invariants is invaluable,
making a safe interface to unsafe code would not be possible without it.
Very useful in the small, and with ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù code.</li>
</ul>

<p>So just for the record I‚Äôm not trying to pick on the above good parts, these are
fine, great even.  With that out of the way, lets look at ways the rest of OO
design can fail in gamedev.</p>

<p>So, superficially games seem well suited to OO because when trying to come up
with OO designs, there are obvious ‚Äúobjects‚Äù that jump out at you.  Using
starbound as our example, things like ‚ÄúPlayer‚Äù, ‚ÄúNPC‚Äù, ‚ÄúMonster‚Äù are pretty
easily understood concepts and obvious candidates for objects in our game, so
lets start with these.  We‚Äôll also include a ‚ÄúWorld‚Äù class which, like the Mario
64 example, is the basic structure of some live play arena (we‚Äôre purposefully
skipping things like interfaces, menus, etc and focusing on the core part of a
game engine).  I‚Äôll also have to switch to C++ because some of this is going to
be difficult to express in Rust.</p>

<p>So far this isn‚Äôt going too bad, but this is still just describing the data
structures in our game.  Remember, one of the OO principles we talked about is
encapsulation, you want to expose a minimal interface to each of these structs
(we really should call them classes!) and methods that only expose what is
necessary.  Also, there‚Äôs that void pointer in entities inside world, we
probably shouldn‚Äôt have that, we‚Äôre going to need to keep our entities stored
somehow so let‚Äôs make an Entity interface while we‚Äôre at it for things that are
common to all entities.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>EntityId</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Forward declare World to pass it to Entity
</span><span>struct</span> <span>World</span><span>;</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>InputState</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>};</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>RenderState</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>};</span>

<span>// Pure virtual interface!
</span><span>class</span> <span>Entity</span> <span>{</span>
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>// Okay, *definitely* all entities will have a position, and it's probably
</span>    <span>// fine for this to be const.
</span>    <span>virtual</span> <span>Vec2F</span> <span>position</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>// Do all entities have a velocity?  Probably not actually, there are
</span>    <span>// probably going to be stationary entities, so let's skip velocity.  Any
</span>    <span>// other common fields?  Honestly probably there are a few that deserve to
</span>    <span>// go here, but there can't be *too* many without immediately thinking of
</span>    <span>// cases where an entity doesn't have them.  Maybe they all return Maybe or
</span>    <span>// something, but that doesn't sound very useful as an interface?  We'll
</span>    <span>// just make more interfaces for those and stick to OO design!
</span>    
    <span>// So, we're going to need to update each entity somehow and probably render
</span>    <span>// it, so let's define a few methods for this.
</span>    
    <span>// Well, we definitely have to pass the entity's world to its update method,
</span>    <span>// because for example a Player has to be able to do things like spawn
</span>    <span>// projectile entities, and so do monsters and NPCs probably.  Also,
</span>    <span>// monsters have to know where the player is to attack them!

<p>So one point before we go on, why am I bothering with this <code>EntityId</code> stuff
here?  This is C++, why can‚Äôt we use pointers?  Well, it turns out that doing
this is <em>very</em> unsafe, so the pattern that all game engines I‚Äôve ever (in
languages without a fancy garbage collector) seen adopt is actually to have
some kind of map from some form of ‚Äúentity id‚Äù to an actual entity pointer and
keep that in a single location.  The reason for this is that, say in C++, let‚Äôs
say every entity keeps a shared_ptr<entity> or some kind of downcasted
shared_ptr.  The problem then becomes that World is now a giant ball of
reference-cycles and entities may never be destructed, and this is a huge
problem.  On the other side of this, if they kept raw pointers, they would be
continually invalidated and this tends to lead to hard to solve ephemeral bugs
and so more or less nobody does this (least, nobody keeps raw pointers /
references around for "very long").  You *could* use for example weak_ptr, and
this is sometimes used, but there tend to be other reasons to use ids because
they're useful for networking and can more easily be saved and loaded from
disk.  This is interesting, because this is the major change that we had to
make in our "UR-game-architecture" to make it compatible with Rust, but it's
very *very* common in game engines in general!</entity></p>

<p>(In game engines, EntityId is usually something like an int that counts up,
possibly a uint64_t that doesn‚Äôt round or a uint32_t that does round, and this
is done so that an EntityId is never or very rarely re-used.  This way, if an
entity goes away, generally anything monitoring it will notice it gone rather
than some other entity immediately taking its place.  There‚Äôs another pattern
here called ‚Äúgenerational indexes‚Äù which is important and I‚Äôll talk about later)</p>

<p>Okay so this seems like it‚Ä¶ could actually work to make a complex game with?
I can sort of imagine a <em>very</em> simple game you could make with these classes and
interfaces as they are right now, but let‚Äôs flesh it out a bit to see what sort
of problems we‚Äôll run into.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs think about what a monster needs to track a player.  They might go through
all the entities in the world, filter by only the players, sort by distance
(you‚Äôd use some kind of spatial hash / kd-tree in reality), and then track the
closest one.  That actually seems basically possible with this as it is!  Okay,
new requirement: monsters should track players with the lowest health first.
Uh-oh, okay player health is private, so we better make a public accessor for
this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Player</span> <span>:</span> <span>Entity</span> <span>{</span>
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>Vec2F</span> <span>position</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>void</span> <span>input</span><span>(</span><span>InputState</span> <span>const</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>input_state</span><span>)</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>World</span><span>*</span> <span>world</span><span>)</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>RenderState</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>render_state</span><span>)</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>float</span> <span>health</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>

<span>private</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We <em>could</em> have just made the health public, but OO design!  What if there‚Äôs an
invariant being held, where if the health drops below some value, some animation
state is triggered?  What about damage?  Certainly the single responsibility
principle states that a <em>monster</em> shouldn‚Äôt be in charge of setting a <em>player‚Äôs</em>
health.</p>

<p>Okay, new requirement: Monsters should not go after players marked as ‚Äúadmin‚Äù.
Alright, add an accessor!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Player</span> <span>:</span> <span>Entity</span> <span>{</span>
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>Vec2F</span> <span>position</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>void</span> <span>input</span><span>(</span><span>InputState</span> <span>const</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>input_state</span><span>)</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>World</span><span>*</span> <span>world</span><span>)</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>RenderState</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>render_state</span><span>)</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>float</span> <span>health</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>
    <span>bool</span> <span>is_admin</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>

<span>private</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, we‚Äôve made a little prototype game but no damage is happening yet, so
let‚Äôs go ahead and get damage set up.  Hmm, where should the damage system for
players go?  Probably a player should reduce their health since it‚Äôs <em>their</em>
health‚Ä¶ or maybe monsters could do it since it‚Äôs <em>their</em> damage region?  I
dunno, I‚Äôll say it‚Äôs the player‚Äôs job.  I guess that means we need accessors on
the monsters for their damage region:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Monster</span> <span>:</span> <span>Entity</span> <span>{</span>
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>Vec2F</span> <span>position</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>void</span> <span>input</span><span>(</span><span>InputState</span> <span>const</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>input_state</span><span>)</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>World</span><span>*</span> <span>world</span><span>)</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>RenderState</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>render_state</span><span>)</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>DamageRegion</span> <span>const</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>damage_region</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>

<span>private</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is turning into a lot of accessors.  We <em>could</em> just start making lots of
things public, but what do OO principles state?  That we should expose as little
and finite an interface as possible so that we can change our implementation
without refactoring.  Maybe this won‚Äôt get <em>so</em> bad.</p>

<p>Okay, new requirements: A certain monster will only aggro the player when the
player touches the ground near them.  Okay, this is going to require yet more
accessors, except because we‚Äôve been following good OO principles about code
re-use, we have that internal member m_physics of type <code>Physics</code>, and it is the
only thing that can know whether an entity is touching the ground.  So, I guess
Physics needs an accessor to <em>its</em> internal state <code>Physics::onGround</code> And then
the <em>Player</em> needs an accessor <code>Player::onGround</code> which in turn will use
<code>Physics::onGround</code>.  Okay, this is turning into LOTS of accessors.</p>

<p>It feels like every time a new requirement comes in, you have to take what may
have once been sane interfaces and ‚Äúpoke more holes through them‚Äù.  8 months
later, most of a semi-game has been built this way and there are LOTS of these
holes poked through.  Lots of code has no clear place to be because it concerns
multiple entities at once, and a lot of logically similar functionality is split
across several files.  ‚ÄúThe problem with OO is that everything happens somewhere
else‚Äù.</p>

<p>A new requirement comes in: I have an idea for a special kind of item that when
the player holds it and its near a specific kind of enemy, it will glow.  The
enemies that trigger this should be scared of the item and back away, but have a
special animation where they‚Äôre mesmerized by the glowing item.  This should
only work for players that have achieved some specific quest goal.</p>

<p>You throw up your hands in frustration, this would require 4 separate modules to
know about all of the other‚Äôs internals (Player, Items, Monsters, Animation).
You add a lot more accessors and special interfaces.  Things are a mess.</p>

<p>So, these are made up examples, but they are not much different than the real
things that I went through a <em>lot</em>.  This is why it is now considered common
knowledge now that for games, OO <em>mostly</em> just gets in the way.  Data hiding has
very limited utility for a game outside of just maintaining invariants at the
edges of the code, where things are smaller and more contained.  A lot, possibly
even the vast majority of the interesting behavior in your game ends up spanning
many data types, and does not naturally ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to any specific entity.  Lots
of entity types are 80% or 60% similar to others and its hard to re-use code,
and the more modules we add inside our entities to help reuse code, the more
layers are added.  What have we gained vs our UR-architecture?  That not
everything is visible to all our functions, even though we keep adding more and
more and more accessors so it sort of is?  Maybe some marginally better code
organization, but also sometimes <em>worse</em> code organization?</p>

<p>Okay, so obviously this has a lot of downsides even in C++, and obviously you
know where we‚Äôre eventually going to end up because I told you at the beginning
of the talk (Just use ECS!).  You CAN make a game this way, but you‚Äôll have a
lot of problems and poke a LOT of holes and probably end up with some
mega-objects.  Just for a nice visceral reaction, let‚Äôs look at the actual,
<em>for-real</em> Player class inside Starbound as of the current version:</p>

<p>Interesting fact, there are many more methods than there are fields in Player,
somehow.  If you handed me a game and asked me to add a feature to the engine,
and asked me whether it would be easier to add in the ‚Äútoo much OO architecture‚Äù
vs ‚ÄúUR-architecture‚Äù, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs easier in the ‚ÄúUR-architecture‚Äù almost
<em>every</em> time.  BUT it IS doable with effort obviously, because lots of Starbound
is like this :(.</p>

<p>So, this has downsides in C++, but not every game has as many crazy one-off
features as Starbound.  Maybe this is just an extreme example, and usually this
is not quite as bad of a problem?  Let‚Äôs see what happens if you try this in
Rust!  <em>Right off the bat</em>, things start to become <em>hard</em>.  Let‚Äôs go back to the
simplest OO version in C++:</p>

<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Partially translating into Rust:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Entity</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Even in this tiny example you can already see this is going to be a huge pain.
First of all, World owns each Entity, but each Entity has a set of mutable
methods, one of which must take a mutable reference to World.  That won‚Äôt work,
because you will mutably borrow an Entity, and then have to mutably borrow it
<em>again</em> to pass in a World reference (which would presumably contain the self
Entity).  In order to do this, probably <em>every</em> Entity implementation would need
internal mutation because otherwise they would have no way to take a World
reference, and also World would probably need internal mutation because it too
would need to be passed by immutable reference.</p>

    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, now we won‚Äôt have borrow errors during entity updates, but now everything
has to be inside a RefCell?  Maybe we can place our entire state inside a
RefCell and it‚Äôs not so hard?  We‚Äôve discussed the tendency for complex
behaviors to be very cross-cutting, so what if we have the following situation:</p>

<p>A monster damages a player, this triggers the player to play an audio as a hurt
sound effect, but for gameplay reasons this <em>also</em> triggers a logical sound that
other creatures can react to.  Maybe there is a swarming behavior for some
particular monster type?  So, hurting a player triggers an external mutation
(audio), internal mutation (health), which then maybe signals monsters which
have their own internal mutations (target entity).  Maybe this all was started
from a Monster, so the control flow goes from Monster to Player and <em>back into</em>
Monster.  If you‚Äôre debugging Monster, you now have triggered <em>spooky action at
a distance</em> by indirectly triggering mutation inside your own struct method.
Except, rust doesn‚Äôt allow this, (and this wouldn‚Äôt even type check probably
without RefCell), so in rust the version of this is that you simply get a
RefCell panic.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs keep going, say entities have some kind of tag or dynamic set of tags, and
let‚Äôs add that to our C++ Entity interface:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Entity</span> <span>{</span>
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>Vec2F</span> <span>position</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tag</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>tags</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Say you profile your game and simply returning a copy of <code>List&lt;Tag&gt;</code> is eating
up huge CPU time, so you change the interface to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Entity</span> <span>{</span>
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>Vec2F</span> <span>position</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tag</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>const</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>tags</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is assuming such a change is possible and not a use after free bug waiting
to happen, which it often is.  Well, Rust is supposed to save us from use after
free, so what happens if you translate this to the Rust version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Entity</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>position</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vec2F</span><span>;</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>tags</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tag</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I‚Äôve made the lifetimes un-elided to make it obvious, but what this says is that
this method returns a single Vec reference that borrows <em>the entire entity</em>.
That‚Äôs.. helpful but also not at all helpful if you want to later call any other
method that might mutate.  If this has internal mutation and is inside a
RefCell, this is also impossible and would have to instead return
<code>std::cell::Ref</code>.  Everything is hard, much harder than it is in C++.  You go
onto IRC to ask for help, you get the well meaning but potentially unhelpful
answer: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just still in the phase where you‚Äôre fighting the borrow
checker.‚Äù</p>

<p>It can get even worse. Entity is pretty sparse, even the real <code>Entity</code> inside
Starbound, but say you apply these same principles to <code>World</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>World</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>World</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>tile</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>:</span> <span>Vector2</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>WorldTile</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>// HUGE number of additional members...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have a big enough <code>World</code> structure, even in the absence of things like
pure virtual interfaces (or in Rust, traits), you can still run into problems.
Should accessing one tile borrow the <em>entire world</em>?  Things would be much
easier if you could somehow borrow only <em>part</em> of the world and thus allow you
to mutate some other part, and that‚Äôs exactly what you could do were all the
fields of World simply public.  Rust is quite good at splitting borrows of a
struct, but by design, it cannot do that for such an opaque method.  This would
be vastly easier if simply World was a struct with plain public members.  This
becomes MORE important the larger the structure is, and data hiding becomes less
important the more into the ‚Äúapplication‚Äù level you are.  With games this
becomes worse and worse, because your games become more and more complicated
over time as you add features.  We‚Äôre not trying to write an engine, we‚Äôre just
trying to write a simple game directly in Rust, all of that data has to go
somewhere!</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre writing a method like this, it‚Äôs more obvious that you can make fields
of a large compound structure public and split borrows will help, but imagine
that you didn‚Äôt design things this way.  Imagine instead that you have <em>two</em>
kinds of Worlds, one for the Server and one for the Client.  This is precisely
how Starbound works, and there is a large complex interface for a ‚Äúworld‚Äù that
is common between the client and server.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>World</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>tile</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>:</span> <span>Vector2</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>WorldTile</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// HUGE number of additional trait methods...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now it‚Äôs <em>impossible</em> to ‚Äújust allow the fields to be public‚Äù regardless of ‚ÄúOO‚Äù
principles or not, just like Entity.  More ‚Äúfighting the borrow checker‚Äù.  OO
principles guide you to having the loosest coupling you can, and a very common
strategy for this is to, rather than having objects depend on each other
directly, that they would depend on each other through a pure interface.
Starbound is <em>chock full</em> of these, Entity and World are only two.  They
<em>amplify</em> borrowing problems by <em>amplifying</em> the amount you are forced to
borrow!</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think I can <em>completely</em> fully justify everything I‚Äôm saying inside a 30
minute talk, this is really only scratching the surface, but hopefully I‚Äôve
given you at least an <em>idea</em> of where I‚Äôm coming from.  I know that for some of
you this is going to sound VERY subjective and possibly only sound like useful
advice for a specific type of software (games).  Also, for a lot of you, this is
maybe boring and you already knew all this, but it‚Äôs still hopefully helpful to
see this as it pertains to an industry which not everyone is part of.</p>

<p>But, that being said, here are some of my takeaways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For games, OO doesn‚Äôt really help, at all.  The parts of OO that are useful
which I listed above are fine, but at the point where you‚Äôre not writing
‚Äúlibrary‚Äù code and are actually writing a game, data hiding is NOT generally
useful, and just wastes a lot of effort and time.  The more data your game
has, the more it changes because you‚Äôre constantly experimenting, the worse
this gets.  This might be old news to you!</li>
  <li>Thinking about ‚Äúobjects‚Äù vs data types in a game sounds superficially
appealing, but it‚Äôs actually actively harmful.  Most behavior doesn‚Äôt
‚Äúattach‚Äù to any data, and if you start thinking about things that way it can
be hard to stop.  Stop conflating the data representation of your game with
the systems that operate on it!</li>
  <li>Sometimes I think I would rather deal with a single 12k line mega-procedure
than a tangled ball of objects.</li>
  <li>Carmack quote: ‚ÄúSometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function.
Not a method.  Not a class.  Not a framework.  Just a function.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Sometimes if you have to write a lot of messy procedural state changes, just
being honest about it with long (maybe not 12k lines) procedures is the best
strategy.  Just be honest about the messiness of what‚Äôs happening, hiding it
in other functions or methods doesn‚Äôt help, it only makes it more confusing
when it goes wrong.  If you can pull things out that are simple and pure
functions, do it, but leave the messy procedural truth as it is!

  <li>
    <p>I find it really easy and enlightening to think about the types of
structures that determine the state of a game.  You can often learn almost
everything you need to know from taking a code base and just looking at all
the type definitions.  If you‚Äôre looking at C++, if you just look at the
struct members and their relationships and ignore all the code, this will
often tell you more than looking at say, the names of functions.  I spent a
lot of time reading Haskell code and they had this pattern that‚Äôs often
mimicked in Rust where they would have a module called ‚ÄúTypes‚Äù that just
had‚Ä¶ all the types that were required in some library.  I kind of like
that, and I think Rust is really great at this kind of programming.</p>

    <p>I‚Äôm being a bit cheeky here, but what tells you more, this interface:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>World</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>EntityPtr</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>entityQuery</span><span>(</span><span>RectF</span> <span>const</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>boundBox</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>or this struct definition:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>World</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>SpatialHash2D</span><span>&lt;</span><span>EntityId</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>,</span> <span>EntityPtr</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>entitySpatialMap</span><span>;</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Obviously a lot of the information here comes from the <em>names</em> of the types,
and clearly <code>SpatialHash2D</code> is some struct of its own with its own
sub-types, but if you name your types well the point still stands, you see
an obvious trail of bread crumbs to follow to understand what an interface
may hide from you (That your spatial entity queries are probably going to be
fast and you shouldn‚Äôt expect a query to take linear time in the number of
entities).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I asked if we could use OO to improve our UR-architecture, and surprisingly we
largely <em>can‚Äôt</em>.  Useful things like the dot operator and data hiding to
maintain invariants in library-ish code aside, the large scale structure of our
game is not really helped by OO.  We need some way to deal with the downsides of
a single giant mutable public nested struct without making an OO mess.  We‚Äôre
now approaching the ECS answer from the top down.</p>

<h2 id="back-to-the-beginning">Back to the beginning.</h2>

<p>Our ‚ÄúOO-architecture‚Äù was a complete bust in Rust, so let‚Äôs start over with
something we know will work, our ‚ÄúUR-architecture‚Äù and try to improve it.  This
is a pretty standard ECS transformation, and you may have seen this before.
I‚Äôve read a bunch of ECS explanations before and I know of one fairly good one,
and <em>lots</em> of really confusing bad ones, and hopefully I can explain this in a
nice way that focuses on the <em>data</em> representation, and is useful to Rust
specifically.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start from the beginning with our simplistic ‚ÄúStarbound‚Äù, writing down
what the state representation of our game is again, but this time in Rust.  No
methods, no functions, only the data types.  This will be very similar to the
Mario 64 example ‚ÄúUR-architecture‚Äù above, with a few small additions:</p>

<p>There are a few changes from the Mario 64 example.  For one, we‚Äôre trying to use
Rust features like enums and data types like Option, rather than trying so hard
to mirror C.  The great thing about this, is suddenly the structure of our game
state has less possible invalid states!  For example, here if we had tried to
use a unified ‚ÄúEntity‚Äù with a type code, like Mario 64, there would be
invariants that had to be kept manually stating that certain fields were in
sensible states depending on the type of the entity.  Now, many of these
invariants just fall naturally out because sum types are so great.  This is
interesting, because it makes encapsulation less important, even with everything
public, there are certain invariants that cannot be broken.  There ARE
invariants that aren‚Äôt expressible in this way though, an example being that the
array of player ids probably need to point to Player type entities only!</p>

<p>The <code>entities: Vec&lt;Option&lt;Entity&gt;&gt;</code> is interesting as well.  Since some of our
entities keep indexes to this array as ‚Äúpointers‚Äù to other entities, it makes
sense that we should never move an entity in the array.  If we allocate a bunch
of entities then remove the first entity we allocated, instead of moving every
entity, we need to set it to None instead so that the rest of the array stays in
place.  When allocating, we probably would go through the array looking for the
first None empty slot, and if none are found, push a new entity onto the end.
This is interesting, because this is very similar to how the ‚ÄúMario 64‚Äù example
worked with a static array.</p>

<p>Other than these changes, this is not really a huge departure.  All of the game
state is still morally global, and each system is still potentially large and
procedural.  Here‚Äôs the thing though‚Ä¶ I actually don‚Äôt think this is very bad
at all?  In all honesty, if I were doing a game jam game, this might be how I
would write my game!</p>

<p>I wouldn‚Äôt write low level graphics or audio code, but if I were doing a simple
2D game or very simple 3D game, this would work for me.  My game state might be
a pretty complex struct full of other structs, and I might have many ‚Äúsystems‚Äù
(which remember here are just regular functions) in different files, and this
would be fine.  I would choose a very simple graphics API with as little state
as possible, to reduce as much as possible the headache of ‚Äúloading‚Äù and
‚Äúunloading‚Äù graphics data and the same with the audio API, and this would be the
structure of my game.  If I had to use a very messy and stateful graphics or
audio system, I would pre-load everything when creating the game state
initially, stick all of it inside some Assets structure, and that would be it.
There are plenty of high level level graphics and sound APIs for Rust that
actually make this really easy.</p>

<p>But, this pattern is obviously not perfect, even other than everything being
globally public.  For one, there‚Äôs a lot of repeated data in each of our entity
types, e.g. with <code>Physics</code> being repeated across Player, Monster, and Npc.  In
our <code>physics_system</code> function, probably there is some commonality in this system
which is broken down further into another function, but the <code>physics_system</code>
definitely <em>for sure</em> has to understand that there are 3 separate entity types
that all have physics.  Whenever we add an entity type, probably this system has
to change its implementation, and honestly probably <em>very many</em> systems have to
change when you add entity types.</p>

<p>Also, as we add more entities, we‚Äôll probably start to find out that a large
part of them will be repeated over and over.  Maybe ‚ÄúMonster‚Äù is too specific,
and you split this up between ‚ÄúFlyingMonster‚Äù and ‚ÄúGroundMonster‚Äù, but they
share 80% of the same fields, and in turn both of those share 50% of their
fields with Player.</p>

<p>This is in some ways better than having all entities be one unified type, but in
some ways actually it‚Äôs kind of worse?  It‚Äôs not terrible, but let‚Äôs see if we
can do better.  Let‚Äôs go back to having a unified Entity type like the Mario 64
example:</p>

<p>Okay, so this is interesting.  It‚Äôs clear that we lose some invariants here in
that more potentially invalid entities could be created, but there are some big
advantages here.  One that stands out is that our implementation of
<code>physics_system</code> is probably vastly simplified, just loop over all the entities
and mutate the <code>physics</code> field if they have one.  This is much simpler than
looping over the entities and having to match on the entity type.</p>

<p>There are still structures that are only valid for each of our ‚Äúlogical‚Äù entity
types though, and clearly it probably wouldn‚Äôt make sense for something to be
both an NPC <em>and</em> a Monster at the same time, so this is I guess another
invariant to keep.  It‚Äôs interesting though, because the amount of per-‚Äútype‚Äù
data got smaller.  Let‚Äôs change this a bit more and separate out more fields:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Physics</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So there are lots and lots of ways to express the fields that may go into each
entity, and they all have their advantages and disadvantages.  In this case,
after transforming our field types this way, a couple of things become
expressible that weren‚Äôt before!  For example, since we‚Äôve broken out the
<code>food_level</code> field from Player and called it <code>Hunger</code>, we can now express entity
types that aren‚Äôt Players that are hungry, so now we can describe NPCs with
hunger.  Also, after breaking out <code>Aggression</code>, we can express hostile NPCs!
However, maybe we can express something with monster-type animation that also
can carry humanoid items, and maybe this is actually logically invalid, so there
is a give and take here.  Still, this is interesting, and solves the problem
where there is much commonality between our entity types that requires repeated
code to express or extract from monolithic enums.</p>

<p>Now, it may be very clear where I‚Äôm going with this already, but this pattern,
where entities are composed of one or more of a set of named parts, and they are
specified a la carte, is very common.  In fact, these parts are normally called
‚Äúcomponents‚Äù!  We now have all of Entities, Components, and Systems, so if you
squint this is everything needed to be an ‚ÄúECS‚Äù system, but this is actually
very simple!  By focusing on the data representation of our state, it is really
not very many steps in between this and what we started with.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs make one more actually sort of inconsequential change, but this will help
us in a second.  Also, we‚Äôll start calling all of these pieces we‚Äôve been
defining ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù just to drive the point home:</p>

<p>This is the classic ‚Äúarray of structs‚Äù to ‚Äústruct of arrays‚Äù transform.  It
should be clear that (nearly) exactly the same information is expressible
between this and the previous representation.  There are a few new invariants to
maintain, namely that each component Vec is the same length, but there‚Äôs not
really new information.  When you just write out types like this, these kinds of
changes actually look pretty simple, instead of in our OO architecture where
something like this might be considered an impossible refactor.  Obviously we‚Äôd
have to change the systems a lot here too potentially every time we made these
changes, but there‚Äôs value in being able to think about the data independently.</p>

<p>The transformation to ‚Äústructs of arrays‚Äù is generally the thing that ECS
introductions really focus on, and then they start talking about performance
concerns and cache behavior and it can be a little confusing and overwhelming.
They‚Äôre not wrong, but I really don‚Äôt think this is the important part.  This is
why I‚Äôve introduced ECS this way, because I think a lot of explanations miss
this point, that from a certain perspective, these changes are actually pretty
boring and normal.  You might have this structure or you might have the previous
structure, maybe one is better performing than the other, but you have not
radically changed programming paradigms by choosing one vs the other.  From a
data-oriented perspective, these things are not earth shattering, they‚Äôre just
performance optimizations.  There are lots MORE potential optimizations you can
do here as well, but I think we‚Äôve reached the point where we have a
bare-minimum that somebody might call an ‚ÄúECS system‚Äù.</p>

<p>There are some takeaways here for Rust users in general, not just game
developers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thinking about JUST the structure of state is really powerful, often times
‚Äúmethods‚Äù and ‚Äúobjects‚Äù get in the way.  Nobody really thinks that having
methods on your structs is ‚Äútoo much OO‚Äù, but it DOES couple your procedures
to your data, even if only organizationally.  Both data structure design and
simple module organization are important, but don‚Äôt conflate them!  I‚Äôm
convinced that ‚ÄúECS design‚Äù in games is so great because it forces you to
think about your data rather than be stuck in OO mode, not because of the
magic of ‚Äústructs of arrays‚Äù.  This is a lesson that can be applied to Rust
in general.</li>
  <li>You can do a LOT with indexes into Vecs.  This is way easier than self
borrowing or Rc&lt;RefCell<t>&gt;.</t></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, let‚Äôs stop for a second and talk about <code>EntityIndex</code>.  I genuinely think
that most of the time when you find yourself running into self borrowing with
Rust, plain Vecs and indexes should first tool you reach for.  There are OTHER
tools, like various arena crates, rental etc, but I think that generally you
should try Vec first.  Generally these problems happen when trying to represent
some kind of graph structure (and an ECS is just a really flat graph‚Ä¶ kind
of), and <em>even in C++</em> this is the advice generally given!  (See Andrei
Alexandrescu‚Äôs performance talks, his favorite data structure in the world is
std::vector, ‚Äújust use vector!‚Äù)  Things like Arena allocators are great and
actually quite performant, and there are versions that work with multiple types,
but they can‚Äôt be ‚Äòstatic without the addition of self-borrowing.  Self
borrowing solutions like rental are tools of <em>last resort</em>.  It is not worth it,
move on with your life, and just use Vecs and indexes.</p>

<p>THAT BEING SAID, they have do have some problems.  In our entity examples, we‚Äôve
been glossing over the question of how to find ‚Äúfree‚Äù EntityIndexes, and how
‚Äúdeletion‚Äù works, because it‚Äôs not actually terribly great.  The cost of
allocating an ‚Äúentity‚Äù is not constant because we have to scan through a Vec
looking for free entries.  Deleting an entity is cheaper, but it has bad
properties.  We can delete an entity which frees up a slot in a Vec, but then
it‚Äôs possible that the very next allocated entity will use the same index.  This
is fine if we make sure that there are no outstanding ‚Äúindex references‚Äù to this
entity before deletion, but what if we mess that up?  We‚Äôll get a ‚Äúrandom other
entity‚Äù in its place without being able to tell that it was in fact removed out
from under us!.  Also, both of these situations are now much worse after the
‚Äústruct of arrays‚Äù transform, because we now have multiple arrays instead of one
and how we manage ‚Äúentity indexes‚Äù is kind of up in the air now.  We‚Äôre going to
solve both of these problems at once.</p>

<h2 id="generational-indexes-are-awesome">Generational indexes are awesome.</h2>

<p>So this is one of my favorite patterns that I‚Äôm not sure is widely known in the
Rust community but I believe is widely known in the gamedev one.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve been using <code>EntityIndex</code> to identify and look up entities stored inside a
Vec.  This is very similar to the pattern I used in the C++ mini-Starbound, I
used an <code>EntityId</code> which was an increasing integer id to store entities like
this:</p>

<p><code>HashMap&lt;EntityId, shared_ptr&lt;Entity&gt;&gt; entities;</code></p>

<p>Both are abstract mappings from integers to some value.  In the Vec case, it is
basically the fastest POSSIBLE data structure, indexing into an array, and in
the case of <code>HashMap</code> it is much slower, but the <code>HashMap</code> is much more
flexible!  For one thing, there is only an upper bound really on the total
number of entries, not on, say the largest size of the index.  <code>HashMap</code> works
just as well if you start the keys at value 1,000,000,000 or 1, certainly a
billion entry Vec is different than a 1 sized one.  This matters for the
deletion problem above.  If we indexed using a HashMap and a key type of <code>u32</code>
or even <code>u64</code>, we could just have new indexes always increment (with eventual
wrap-around).  In this way, you could more or less guarantee that no index would
ever be re-used, or at the VERY least it would be a ‚Äúvery long time‚Äù before an
index would be reused.  In the <code>u64</code> case, if you ever re-used an index, your
game technology probably has ‚Äúcloud‚Äù in the name, so you might have bigger
problems anyway :).  BUT HashMap is much slower than Vec :(</p>

<p>Is there a way to get this property with integer indexes into a Vec?  There is,
and it‚Äôs called ‚Äúgenerational indexes‚Äù!</p>

<p>Instead of using just an integer index, we make a ‚Äúgenerational index‚Äù type like
this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// You can use other types that usize / u64 if these are too large</span>
<span>#[derive(Eq,</span> <span>PartialEq,</span> <span>etc</span><span>...</span><span>)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>GenerationalIndex</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we make something called an ‚ÄúGenerationalIndexAllocator‚Äù:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>AllocatorEntry</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>is_live</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>GenerationalIndexAllocator</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>// Returns true if the index was allocated before and is now deallocated</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(There are faster ways to implement this, but this one is actually pretty much
fine.  Also note that this is an obviously GOOD use of data hiding).</p>

<p>The basic idea is that you can ‚Äúallocate‚Äù indexes for a vector just like if you
had <code>Vec&lt;Option&lt;Entry&gt;&gt;</code>, but you will instead never re-use indexes.  It works
like this, you allocate an index and get back a <code>GenerationalIndex</code> with real
index 0, it will also have ‚Äúgeneration‚Äù 0.  If you delete that index, it will go
into a pool of free indexes, so next time you allocate an index you might get
back another generational index with real index 0, but crucially the generation
will now be 1.  Generational indexes are never re-used because the generation
will always increment, yet the ‚Äúreal indexes‚Äù will always be ‚Äúsmall‚Äù, on the
order of the largest total number of entries ever allocated.  This way, you can
use fast indexing into a Vec without many of the bad ‚Äúpointer-like‚Äù properties
of simple indexes!</p>

<p>I said this pattern is not widely known inside the Rust community, but that‚Äôs at
least a bit of a lie because there is a recently released crate built on this
idea called ‚Äúslotmap‚Äù and it‚Äôs great!  However, it‚Äôs missing a CRUCIAL feature
for our example, which is that in ‚Äúslotmap‚Äù you can only allocate indexes for a
specific SlotMap, you can‚Äôt allocate indexes and re-use them for different
SlotMaps.  Useful, but it would be vastly MORE useful if these concepts were
separate, which is what we‚Äôve sketched out here.  Indexes into a Vec are already
a great pattern when encountering ‚Äúself borrowing‚Äù, and generational indexes
make it much much better.  ‚Äúslotmap‚Äù beat me to releasing a crate for it :(, so
consider this a feature request :)</p>

<p>We‚Äôll go ahead and make a type that‚Äôs a bit easier to use than <code>Vec&lt;Option&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>
to store our actual data as well:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>ArrayEntry</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>// An associative array from GenerationalIndex to some Value T.</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>GenerationalIndexArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Set the value for some generational index.  May overwrite past generation</span>
    <span>// values.</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>set</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>:</span> <span>GenerationalIndex</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>// Gets the value for some generational index, the generation must match.</span>

<p>Neat!  We‚Äôre in the home stretch now, this is almost a full blown ECS system.</p>

<p>Take away for users of Rust in general: obviously generational indexes are
awesome but for some reason they‚Äôre more popular only in C++, but they‚Äôre
potentially even MORE useful for Rust!  To the author of ‚Äúslotmap‚Äù, please
expose the allocator separately, it‚Äôs hugely useful!  If that doesn‚Äôt seem in
scope or the kind of API you want to provide, I can release a similar crate with
the version I have that does do this.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-typing-is-actually-kind-of-nice-in-very-controlled-quantities">Dynamic typing is actually kind of nice in VERY controlled quantities.</h2>

<p>Okay, we‚Äôre really close now, this is very close to how a ‚Äúreal‚Äù ECS system
(like specs!) might work.  The biggest problem we haven‚Äôt addressed from earlier
is still that everything is kind of global still.  More so, every ‚Äúsystem‚Äù (for
us, this is still just a fancy name for plain functions) depends on <em>all</em> of the
types that go into our game state, which may be quite large.  Most of a game is
going to live inside one crate and the dependency graph between modules such as
this is really hardly anything to fret over, but still changing anything inside
‚ÄúGameState‚Äù potentially would affect every system at least <em>theoretically</em>.
Let‚Äôs see what we can do about this?</p>

<p>I want to emphasize before we go on that this, like many steps before, is
<em>optional</em>.  You may balk at this as unnecessary complication, and you may be
right!  This IS something that is in most ECS implementations though, so it‚Äôs
worth covering if only to understand them, and it‚Äôs more or less unavoidable
when trying to build a library to do this sort of thing.</p>

<p>For this we‚Äôre going to need the <code>anymap</code> crate, but also the <code>mopa</code> crate would
do as well.  What we need is a container that can store exactly one of every
type that we put into it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>AnyMap</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>AnyMap</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>insert</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get_mut</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How might we use this to store our components?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>PhysicsComponent</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>HumanoidAnimationComponent</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>HumanoidItemsComponent</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>MonsterAnimationComponent</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>PlayerComponent</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Entity</span> <span>=</span> <span>GenerationalIndex</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>EntityMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>GenerationalIndexArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>assets</span><span>:</span> <span>Assets</span><span>,</span>
    
    <span>entity_allocator</span><span>:</span> <span>GenerationalIndexAllocator</span><span>,</span>
    <span>// We're assuming that this will contain only types of the pattern</span>
    <span>// `EntityMap&lt;T&gt;`.  This is dynamic, so the type system stops being helpful</span>
    <span>// here, you could use `mopa` crate to make this somewhat better.</span>
    <span>entity_components</span><span>:</span> <span>AnyMap</span><span>,</span>

    <span>players</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Entity</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>

    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now instead of storing game-specific data, let‚Äôs just keep going with dynamic
typing!  We‚Äôll say that our game state is a dynamic collection of entities with
components, and <em>also</em> a dynamic collection of other types, one of each type.
We‚Äôll call these ‚Äúresources‚Äù.  Also we‚Äôll change the name from <code>GameState</code> to
something more accurate.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Entity</span> <span>=</span> <span>GenerationalIndex</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>EntityMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>GenerationalIndexArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>ECS</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>entity_allocator</span><span>:</span> <span>GenerationalIndexAllocator</span><span>,</span>
    <span>// Full of types like `EntityMap&lt;T&gt;`.</span>
    <span>entity_components</span><span>:</span> <span>AnyMap</span><span>,</span>

    <span>resources</span><span>:</span> <span>AnyMap</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here we have arrived at what an actual ECS data structure might look like.
I‚Äôve added a ‚Äúresources‚Äù AnyMap because this is also a very common pattern, and
it means that more or less your entire game state can be expressed inside this
‚ÄúECS‚Äù structure.  We‚Äôre calling it an ‚ÄúECS‚Äù, but importantly, really there
aren‚Äôt any mentions of ‚Äúsystems‚Äù in sight.  I don‚Äôt actually like describing
ECSes in terms of systems, because I think while it can be important, it‚Äôs
really incidental.  If our ‚Äúsystems‚Äù are pure functions in a loop or they‚Äôre
something much fancier, BOTH of these capture the important part of ECS design.</p>

<p>So, you may be balking now at the egregious and sudden introduction of dynamic
typing.  Let‚Äôs stop and think though what this buys us.  Say you get a new
feature request for your game, say you need a new crazy special monster that has
some kind of counter inside it.  Every time you kill the monster, it copies itself
into two and decrements the counter, duplicating like the heads on a hydra.
This means you might need a new component type, say <code>EnemyDuplicationLevel</code> or
something.  With dynamic typing, you can add this component without ‚Äúdisturbing‚Äù
your other systems, because without importing the new module, they can‚Äôt
possibly ‚Äúsee‚Äù that the ECS has such a component anyway.  The same is true for
resources, you can add new data types to your model without ‚Äúdisturbing‚Äù
existing systems.</p>

<p>The justification for this may seem pretty weak, and it kind of is.  In order to
get the full picture we need to go a bit further.  I‚Äôm going to speed up a bit
so we can get to the end and I can show a full-ish picture, something which I
consider a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù game engine design that you might use for a medium or large
project.  It‚Äôs actually not much further along than this, but the last few
features are all related and are not as useful alone.</p>

<h2 id="the-registry-pattern">The ‚Äúregistry‚Äù pattern</h2>

<p>Now that we‚Äôve introduced dynamic typing, there‚Äôs a design pattern that I like
in Rust that I haven‚Äôt really seen in practice yet (I‚Äôm sure it exists and I
have just not seen it).  I‚Äôm going to call it the ‚Äúregistry pattern‚Äù.</p>

<p>In ECS implementations like specs, there‚Äôs a step where you ‚Äúregister‚Äù a type
with your ECS, which inserts an entry into some AnyMap or equivalent to an
AnyMap.  Using a component type that is unregistered is usually an error.  Let‚Äôs
take this a bit further, and not tie ‚Äúregistering‚Äù to the ECS per se, let‚Äôs make
our own ‚Äúregistry‚Äù.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>ComponentRegistry</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We‚Äôll also make one for ‚Äúresources‚Äù</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>ResourceRegistry</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>ResourceRegistry</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// The Resource trait provides loading from JSON and other things.</span>

global type registry like you might find in Java.  It feels a bit
‚Äúenterprisey‚Äù, but it‚Äôs quite useful!  It is <em>also</em> similar (again, if you
squint) to very full-featured all encompassing engines with built-in editors,
where you might say add a component type through some menu or GUI and it ends
up being stored in some project config file.  In this case, instead of a
project config file it‚Äôs simply a bit of auxiliary rust code.</p>

<p>This pattern ends up being very useful!  Imagine you have some game state that
can be loaded from a JSON config file.  Each resource and component can be
loaded from JSON, so you can just add a component or resource type and then add
the entry to the data format, load the game and see it (except you need a new
system that understands the new types, we‚Äôll get there in a sec).</p>

<p>So at this point, this is a sketch of something that is unmistakably turning
into a ‚Äúreal‚Äù ECS game engine.  I like this, because so far, except for some
brief required library-ish functionality, I have barely talked about functions
or systems!  The reason for this is, I don‚Äôt like introducing this concept by
talking about behavior, I really think that thinking just about how we describe
our state is a much more useful way to approach this.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, it‚Äôs pretty easy to see how you could also just as
easily add a <code>SystemRegistry</code> to go along with this.  Our systems are just
functions, so all this would do is allow you to add functions to your main loop
in a slightly more complicated way.  One possible addition here is to allow
systems to have some kind of config, so that maybe you can configure tunable
parameters for them or even use the same function multiple times with different
parameters.  It‚Äôs generally advised though that you try very hard not to give
your systems <em>state</em>, so you can limit your game state to just components and
resources.  If your game state is just components and resources, you can often
do cool things like clone them (save state like in an emulator!) or easily
serialize it, and this is harder with something like system closures.</p>

<p>Takeaways for regular Rust: The registry pattern is actually quite nice.  In
Starbound there is a ‚ÄúRoot‚Äù object which is sort of like this, where every type
is registered, but it‚Äôs more stateful than what I‚Äôve described here.  It‚Äôs read
only, but it‚Äôs constructed by reading assets.  I actually like the idea of a
‚Äútype registry‚Äù, and something like this is necessary as soon as you want to use
this sort of dynamic typing with AnyMap, and the two patterns go together well
to limit the problem of ‚Äúeverything depending on everything else‚Äù.</p>

<h2 id="ecs-is-sql-for-games">ECS is SQL for games</h2>

<p>Let me pull the curtain back a bit.  What have we described so far: A way of
declaring a special kind of key (Entity), and a series of records that go with
those keys (components), and also for good measure a way to define records that
don‚Äôt pair with any of those keys (resources).  We‚Äôve added dynamic typing into
the mix, and shown a pattern so that you can define all the record types you
have in one place (kind of like a schema?).  In the real ECS I have built, I
even have ways of performing primitive ‚Äúqueries‚Äù on components, saying ‚Äúgive me
all entities with a position, optionally a velocity, but NOT a mass‚Äù.</p>

<p>This probably sounds achingly familiar, and if it does there‚Äôs a good reason for
it.  ECS is just SQL for games.  A very, very, very limited form of SQL, but
spiritually very similar.  Define the schema for your data, load it, run queries
on it, and update it.  Very limited SQL where every query might have to run in
no more than a few microseconds.</p>

<p>I said earlier that I‚Äôve read a lot of bad introductions to ECS and one good
one.  I‚Äôm not the first to mention this parallel between ECS and SQL, all the
way back in 2009, there was an
<a href="http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/">article</a>
about this very point with a focus on MMOs.</p>

<p>So, if this is true, why can‚Äôt we just use something like sqlite to store our
game state?  The funny thing is, you might actually be able to do this, but it‚Äôs
tough to run queries fast enough in 16ms.  Let‚Äôs think about what kind of
benefits this would bring, though!  Oh man, I need to make a save format for the
game.. nope it‚Äôs SQL I‚Äôm already done.  Oh, I need to update the format of
everyone‚Äôs save file.. write some external SQL update scripts and you‚Äôre done!
Oh, I‚Äôd like to give the ability to save the game‚Äôs state at any arbitrary
point?  Done.  I noticed a bug and I want to roll back the game state to 30
seconds ago and step through it frame by frame, running queries to see when a
bad state was produced?  done. All this careful introduction of the generational
indexes concept, SQL has this already, they‚Äôre keys with auto increment (more
like <code>HashMap&lt;EntityId, T&gt;</code> really).</p>

<p>At that point, each of your systems would basically be a series of queries to
get data out of SQL, some updates, and then writing it back out to SQL.  We‚Äôve
turned sexy game development into boring old web development! (web development
can be sexy and game development can be boring, just for the record)</p>

<p>The only issue is that I‚Äôm <em>pretty</em> sure it‚Äôs about two orders of magnitude too
slow to work, but still it‚Äôs a neat idea, and it‚Äôs useful to draw parallels!</p>

<p>I think this is important, because I see a lot of debate about ‚Äúwhat makes
something a pure ECS‚Äù that I think is ultimately pretty silly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is it an ECS if entities can have multiples of a component?  Well, the
differences between multiples of a component and a component that contains
just a Vec are very very few, but yes it‚Äôs still ECS.  Is it still SQL if you
have two tables that are 1 to N instead of 1 to 1?  Yes, of course it is.</li>
  <li>Is it still an ECS if my components have methods?  Yes, adding a component
method is not the end of the world, especially if there is a small local
invariant to maintain.  SQL is all about data, but it also has stored
procedures to maintain invariants.</li>
  <li>Is it still an ECS if I need two different ECS sets, or I put lots of data
into resources?  Should I be using ‚Äúsingleton entities‚Äù or resources?  Is it
still SQL if I have two different databases, or split a top level table apart?
Yes, of course!</li>
</ul>

<p>‚Ä¶ and so on</p>

<p>The analogy is not perfect, but I think this is really kind of illuminating.
There is research currently about how to make more capable ECS systems that have
things like component graphs with child relationships between components and
entities and all kinds of crazy stuff, and the thing is that‚Äôs of course fine.
SQL has all of this already, it‚Äôs an entire language and set of software for
expressing <em>all kinds</em> of data relationships, it‚Äôs just that games have
generally simpler needs, will basically always be in-memory only, and have
timing requirements on the order of nanoseconds or microseconds, so we
compromise and make new tools.</p>

<p>This is the other reason I‚Äôm doing this talk, to help further de-mystify ‚ÄúECS‚Äù
and show how we ended up here, and to give perspective.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-place-where-it-all-goes-wrong">The one place where it all goes wrong</h2>

<p>(NOTE: I don‚Äôt know if I need this section at all, I‚Äôm just hawking the OTHER
talk I wanted to do.  Maybe this is unimportant?  This talk is already
potentially very very long)</p>

<p>I claimed at the beginning that the attitude I see of being overly skeptical of
the borrow checker, of considering it too restrictive, is bunk.  I still
absolutely believe this, but I want to talk quickly about the one place where I
kept running into issues, really the <em>only</em> place where I really had trouble,
where I constantly felt limited.  Certainly as a project grows in size,
<em>something</em> must go wrong right?  Well, I have one example of this, though this
problem isn‚Äôt really limited to Rust at all, it‚Äôs just more <em>immediately</em>
painful (noticing a pattern?).</p>

<p>Language boundaries are hard.</p>

<p>So, the issues here are all‚Ä¶ pretty hard to explain succinctly.  I‚Äôm not sure
I can come up with small limited examples like before without getting way into
the weeds and doubling the length of this already lengthy talk.  I wrote an
entire crate (rlua) just to try and solve this problem, and after a ridiculous
amount of work I can confidently say that I‚Äôve <em>sort of</em> half-solved it.</p>

<p>I have a representation of components where you choose to read or write each
component (they‚Äôre stored in RwLocks for system concurrency).  I want Lua to be
able to read a set of systems, so I have a lua script perform a ‚Äúquery‚Äù on the
ECS store.  All I need to do is to be able to hand Lua the ‚ÄúRwLockReadGuard‚Äù
(really a structure containing this) that the query returns, except‚Ä¶
RwLockReadGuard is not static.  Oh I guess I‚Äôll just have the Lua query lock
inside the query API rather than once at the beginning‚Ä¶ well that would be
very slow and also not thread safe, a query should lock for the whole time.  I
guess I could use the rental crate.. oh god the rental crate is HARD and this is
TERRIBLE.  (I was later able to solve this problem with rlua‚Äôs ‚Äúscope‚Äù system,
but it‚Äôs still bad).</p>

<p>It‚Äôs best if you don‚Äôt have your systems be stateful, right?  Generally systems
should store data either in the components they operate on if they‚Äôre logically
related, or maybe in a custom resource, or simply store some cache-like values
but be prepared if the system is reloaded and the cache is reset.  Don‚Äôt rely on
data that can‚Äôt be saved / restored / serialized etc.  This is great until you
write a Lua system, because exfiltrating values outside of Lua is actually
really hard.  You can‚Äôt store a Lua state inside a resource because it‚Äôs not
Sync, and you can‚Äôt store Lua data separate from the state because the Lua
internal state and external handles are REALLY not Sync.  You can sort of solve
this with magic Lua registry keys, but then if each system has its own Lua
instance, you‚Äôve made a footgun if you ever try to use Lua values in the wrong
context, and they‚Äôre not serializable anyway.</p>

<p>You can make a data type which is limited to just data and not an internal Lua
type, but then you must write marshalling between it and the non-lua
representation, so every time your script system reads or writes this storage
it‚Äôs <em>dog slow</em>.  Some of the slowness is from copying data, but most of it is
from the intrinsically slow Lua API.</p>

<p>Everything is hard, it works if you really try but you feel like it should be
simpler than this.  It‚Äôs harder even than the equivalent in C++, but the
equivalent in C++ is actually just as bad, you just notice way faster in Rust.
At least there are not constant crashes and shared_ptr cycles now?</p>

<p>Seems a bit similar to our situation before, where we were trying the wrong
approach with OO.  Unfortunately, in the case of rlua, there are pretty hard
limitations based on how the internal Lua C API works, and it might be close to
the best I can offer.</p>

<p>Language boundaries are hard, especially between languages that have very
different sets of limitations like Rust and Lua (or C++ and Lua).  Especially in
the presence of a garbage collector in the contained language, if the garbage
collector in the contained language ever makes contact with one in the host
language, nothing will work, nothing will get collected. (In C++ / Rust this is
shared_ptr / Arc, yes these are a sort of garbage collector).</p>

<p>I mention this because I think Lua is very popular for games, and I get
questions a lot about how to combine rlua with things like specs, and I think
it‚Äôs just really hard, and goes against the larger point I‚Äôm making with this
talk.  I think this is probably <em>uniquely</em> hard due to language boundaries being
so tricky, and the situation is not vastly worse or better than the one in C++,
it‚Äôs slightly more difficult and vastly safer, just slightly more difficult is
not a great answer when in C++ it‚Äôs still very difficult.</p>

<p>I also mention this because I might have an answer for this soon!  The OTHER
talk I thought about doing was describing what I believe is a novel way of
implementing language runtimes safely in rust that have garbage collection that
is zero cost, and comes with the ability to have a fast, mostly pain-free (or as
much as possible) bindings experience.</p>

<p>In the meantime, think really really hard before you add a scripting layer to
your game engine.  The problem is, I LOVE scripting layers in game engines (for
modability and many other reasons), so I do this anyway, but it is not a
decision to be taken lightly and it can eat up a lot of time and effort.  I want
to make this more painless though, and make a safe, fast Lua that feels at home
in Rust in the same way that PUC-Rio‚Äôs Lua feels at home in C.  I will talk
about this in the future!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I had multiple purposes with this talk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To walk through the design of a medium-scale rust project for those with only
experience in small-scale ones.</li>
  <li>To show some examples of traps people might fall in that cause them to ‚Äúfight
the borrow checker‚Äù, and to help make more concrete how to move past this
phase, at least in part.</li>
  <li>To show how awesome data-oriented programming is and how well of a fit it is
for games and for Rust</li>
  <li>To show how patterns in game dev that appeared long before Rust, when applied
to Rust, still seem to be a good fit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I talked a lot about patterns that in some cases were hard fought in other
languages, only appearing after laboriously exploring the space of solutions
that DIDN‚ÄôT ultimately work.  Interestingly, those solutions that ultimately
don‚Äôt work very well often times are painful more quickly in Rust, they‚Äôre
louder, MORE annoying.  I think this is a good thing, and I like having tools
that make bad patterns feel as bad as they are.  Rust is <em>great</em> at this.</p>

<p>But could you take most of the lessons here and apply them just as easily in
C++?  In C?  Yes, absolutely.  Even if you‚Äôre the sort of person that doesn‚Äôt
make these mistakes even when there isn‚Äôt this sort of language pressure to
avoid them (you‚Äôre way better than me), there are tons of other great benefits.
I didn‚Äôt really get a chance to talk about all the benefits of Rust or talk
about my experiences with Rust in general, because I only have 30 minutes and
this is probably way longer than 30 minutes at this point.</p>
