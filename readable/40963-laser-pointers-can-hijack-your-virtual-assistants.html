    <h1>Laser Pointers Can Hijack Your Virtual Assistants</h1>

<p>Laser beams can trick a voice-controlled virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant into acting as if they registered an audio command, researchers report.</p><p>This trick worked at a distance of more than 300 feet and through a glass window.</p><p>The researchers discovered in the microphones of these systems a vulnerability that they call &#x201C;Light Commands.&#x201D; They also propose hardware and software fixes, and they&#x2019;re working with Google, Apple, and Amazon to put them in place.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve shown that hijacking voice assistants only requires line-of-sight rather than being near the device,&#x201D; says Daniel Genkin, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan. &#x201C;The risks associated with these attacks range from benign to frightening depending on how much a user has tied to their assistant.</p><p>&#x201C;In the worst cases, this could mean&#xA0;<a href="https://www.futurity.org/security-and-privacy-threats-best-practices-2195192-2/">dangerous access</a>&#xA0;to homes, e-commerce accounts, credit cards, and even any connected medical devices the user has linked to their assistant.&#x201D;</p><p>The team showed that Light Commands could enable an attacker to remotely inject inaudible and invisible commands into smart speakers, tablets, and phones in order to:</p><ul>
<li>Unlock a smart lock-protected front door</li>
<li>Open a connected garage door</li>
<li>Shop on e-commerce websites at the target&#x2019;s expense</li>
<li>Locate, unlock, and start a vehicle that&#x2019;s connected to a target&#x2019;s account</li>
</ul><p>Just five milliwatts of laser power&#x2014;the equivalent of a laser pointer&#x2014;was enough to obtain full control over many popular Alexa and Google smart home devices, while about 60 milliwatts was sufficient in phones and tablets.</p><p>To document the vulnerability, the researchers aimed and focused their light commands with a telescope, a telephoto lens, and a tripod. They tested 17 different devices representing a range of the most popular assistants.</p><p>&#x201C;There is a semantic gap between what the sensors in these devices are advertised to do and what they actually sense, leading to&#xA0;<a href="https://www.futurity.org/internet-connected-devices-security-risks-website-2150812/">security risks</a>,&#x201D; says Kevin Fu, an associate professor of computer science and engineering . &#x201C;In Light Commands, we show how a microphone can unwittingly listen to light as if it were sound.&#x201D;</p><p>Users can take some measures to protect themselves from Light Commands.</p><p>&#x201C;One suggestion is to simply avoid putting smart speakers near windows, or otherwise attacker-visible places,&#x201D; says Sara Rampazzi, a postdoctoral researcher in computer science and engineering. &#x201C;While this is not always possible, it will certainly make the attacker&#x2019;s window of opportunity smaller. Another option is to turn on user personalization, which will require the attacker to match some features of the&#xA0;<a href="https://www.futurity.org/voice-hacking-app-1451782-2/">owner&#x2019;s voice</a>&#xA0;in order to successfully inject the command.&#x201D;</p><p>Additional researchers from the University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo and the University of Michigan contributed to the work.<svg class="content-tombstone">
