They tested 17 different devices representing a range of the most popular assistants.</p><p>“There is a semantic gap between what the sensors in these devices are advertised to do and what they actually sense, leading to <a href="https://www.futurity.org/internet-connected-devices-security-risks-website-2150812/">security risks</a>,” says Kevin Fu, an associate professor of computer science and engineering . “In Light Commands, we show how a microphone can unwittingly listen to light as if it were sound.”</p><p>Users can take some measures to protect themselves from Light Commands.</p><p>“One suggestion is to simply avoid putting smart speakers near windows, or otherwise attacker-visible places,” says Sara Rampazzi, a postdoctoral researcher in computer science and engineering. “While this is not always possible, it will certainly make the attacker’s window of opportunity smaller. Another option is to turn on user personalization, which will require the attacker to match some features of the <a href="https://www.futurity.org/voice-hacking-app-1451782-2/">owner’s voice</a> in order to successfully inject the command.”</p><p>Additional researchers from the University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo and the University of Michigan contributed to the work.</p><p><em>Source: <a href="https://news.umich.edu/a-laser-pointer-could-hack-your-voice-controlled-virtual-assistant/">University of Michigan</a></em></p><footer class="article-meta"><p><a href="https://lightcommands.com/20191104-Light-Commands.pdf" target="_blank" class="source-link">Original Study</a></p></footer></div></div></div></div>
