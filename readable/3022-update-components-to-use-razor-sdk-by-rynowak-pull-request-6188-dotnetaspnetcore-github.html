The tooling repo has the codegen baseline tests, and this repo has the integration tests that <strong>run</strong> component code. In theory these integration tests could be written to use components as loose <code>.cshtml</code> and <code>.razor</code> - there are a lot, and it's not broken so I just left them as-is. My personal preference would be destroy all code that uses the existing set of APIs to call into the Razor compiler, but that would be a huge task. I removed all tests that just verify static things about the generated code since those are adequately tested in the tooling repo.</p></div></div></div></div>
