<p>Back when there were rumors of Google building an operating system, I thought<span></span> <span>“</span>Lol.”</p>
<p>Then I watched then-PM Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QRO3gKj3qw">announce Chrome <span>OS</span></a>. My heart raced. It was perfect.</p>
<p>I got my email through Gmail, I wrote documents on Docs, I listened to Pandora, I viewed photos on TheFacebook. Why did I need all of Windows Vista?</p>
<p>In 2010, I predicted that by 2020 Chrome <span>OS</span> would be the most popular desktop <span>OS</span> in the world. It was fast, lightweight, and $0.</p>
<p><span>“</span>Every Windows and <span>OS</span> X app will be re-built for the browser!” I thought. Outlook-&gt;Gmail. Excel-&gt;Sheets. Finder-&gt;Dropbox. Photoshop-&gt;Figma. Terminal-&gt;Repl.it.</p>
<p>All of your files would be accessible by whoever you wanted, wherever you wanted, all the time. It was obvious. Revolutionary.</p>
<p>I haven’t installed <span>MSFT</span> Office on a machine since 2009. Sheets and Docs have been good enough for me. The theoretical unlimited computing power and collaboration features meant Google Docs was better than Office (and free!).</p>
<p>Then something happened at Google. I’m not sure what. But they stopped innovating on cloud software.</p>
<p>Docs and Sheets haven’t changed in a decade. Google Drive remains impossible to navigate. Sharing is complicated. Sheets freezes up. I can’t easily interact with a Sheets <span>API</span> (I’ve tried!). Docs still shows page breaks by default! <span>WTF</span>!</p>
<p>Even though I have an iPhone and a MacBook, I’ve been married to Google services. I browse Chrome. I use Gmail. I get directions and lookup restaurants on Maps. I’m a YouTube addict.</p>
<p>Yet I’ve been ungluing myself from Google so far this year. Not because of Google-is-reading-my-emails-and-tracking-every-keystroke reasons, but because I like other software so much more that it’s worth switching.</p>
<p>At <span>WWDC</span>, Apple shared Safari stats for macOS Big Sur. It reminded me how much Chrome makes my machine go <span>WHURRRRRR</span>. Yesterday, I made Safari my default browser again.</p>
<p>My Gmail inbox has become a mailbox stuffed with clothing flyers, SaaS mailers, and Rollbar alerts. I love when people respond to Second Breakfast, but their responses get lost amid a sea of plastic bottles. I started using <span>HEY</span> last week. My new email is <a href="mailto:billy@hey.com">billy@hey.com</a>. I love it so far.</p>
<p>I’ve given up on Google Docs. I can never find the documents Andy shares with me. The formatting is tired and stuck in the you-might-print-this-out paradigm. Notion is a much better place to write and brainstorm with people.</p>
<p>The mobile Google results page is so cluttered that I switched my iPhone’s default search to DuckDuckGo. The results are a tad worse, but I’m never doing heavy-duty searches on the go. And now I don’t have to scroll past 6 ads to get the first result. DuckDuckGo’s privacy is an added bonus.</p>
<p>I still use Google Sheets heavily. But wow, Airtable makes Sheets feel decrepit. Where’s the easy API? New ways of formatting? Better collaboration? Simple sheet-as-a-database?</p>
<p>My new usage patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email: <del>Gmail</del> <span>HEY</span></li>
<li>Search: <del>Google</del> DuckDuckGo (mobile) and Google (desktop)</li>
<li>Maps: Google</li>
<li>Docs: <del>Google</del> Notion</li>
<li>Sheets: Google</li>
<li>Video: YouTube (but increasingly I’m noticing other people use Twitch, Instagram, and TikTok)</li>
<li>Video Calls: <del>Google Meet</del> Zoom</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m a long shareholder of Google. It’s amazing how they have four monopolies and only monetize one of them. I’m confident they have a bright future ahead.</p>
<p>But the lack of innovation is frustrating. The product goals are all over the place. Microsoft has a new clear mission: The Cloud. What’s Google’s clear mission?</p>
<p>It feels like they blew a 10 year lead.</p>
