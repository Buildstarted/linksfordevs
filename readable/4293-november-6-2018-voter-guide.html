But he didn‚Äôt get the 50% threshold of support from our members to earn our endorsement. Sadly many of us just can‚Äôt support him after watching his ‚Äú</span><a href="http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/06/10/two-newsoms/"><span>style above substance</span></a><span>‚Äù politics, opportunistic grandstanding, </span><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/S-F-mayor-s-friendship-with-Google-s-founders-2501176.php"><span>shady</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Newsom-addresses-decade-old-affair-in-the-context-12553923.php"><span>scuzzy</span></a><span> tenure as Mayor. He was consistently on the </span><a href="http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2010/02/11/newsoms-72-million-corporate-giveaway/"><span>side of big business</span></a><span>, tried to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t868YU1aWro"><span>co-opt immigrant rights activists</span></a><span> while </span><a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article215092135.html"><span>reporting immigrant youth to ICE</span></a><span>, and generally acted like a spoiled rich kid </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1eE2BbXas"><span>who was too good for the rest of us</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>We‚Äôre pissed at how he </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-democrat-gavin-newsom-attacks-john-cox_us_5b12ca41e4b02143b7cccbd7"><span>cynically propped up Republican John Cox in the primary</span></a><span> because he‚Äôll have an easier time beating him than another Democrat--even though having Villaraigosa on the ballot would‚Äôve helped Democratic turnout in swing districts. We‚Äôre also pissed at how he‚Äôs </span><a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/news/newsom-slams-s-f-homeless-funding-effort/"><span>parroting the Chamber of Commerce‚Äôs talking points against Prop C</span></a><span>. Dude, when you split San Francisco for the burbs as soon as you were elected Lt. Governor, you kinda forfeited your right to lecture us about homelessness! 2016‚Äôs Prop 63 was another of example of Gavin‚Äôs ‚Äústyle over substance‚Äù approach: a </span><a href="http://www.theleaguesf.org/nov_2016#prop63"><span>mostly unnecessary and duplicative measure</span></a><span> that let Gav act like a champion on gun control. We hope he‚Äôll surprise us with a progressive turn as Governor, but we‚Äôre not holding our breath. After all, actually accomplishing something for normal Californians would jeopardize his chance of hair-gel-slime-trailing his way into the White House. We‚Äôre getting ready for eight years of empty PR politics.</span></p><p><span><a href="#top">^Back to Top</a></span></p><p><strong>Lieutenant Governor: Ed Hernandez&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/pile-of-poo/">üí©</a><a href="https://emojipedia.org/confused-face/">üòï</a>üí©</span></strong></p><p><span>Blargh. Do we really need a Lieutenant Governor? We‚Äôre skeptical that this office is worth having, and we‚Äôre bummed that Gayle McLaughlin (former Mayor of Richmond and progressive hero) didn‚Äôt finish in the top two in June. Two establishment Democrats did, and one of them will become a semi-high profile leader in California, so we‚Äôre going with the one who has the most receipts we can analyze.</span></p><p><span>The Lt. Governor doesn‚Äôt have much real power, except with the Governor is out of the state, but they do serve on a bunch of important boards--the State Lands Commission, UC Regents, and CSU Board of Trustees being the most important--and appoints people to a number of others.</span></p><p><strong>Ed Hernandez</strong><span> is an optometrist turned termed-out state Senator from the San Gabriel Valley. He has a long record of votes and </span><a href="https://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/69507/ed-hernandez#.W0proNMvxp8"><span>legislative scorecards</span></a><span> that show him landing somewhere between the progressive and squishy-middle camps in Sacramento, depending on the issues. He‚Äôs been solid on labor, education, and women‚Äôs issues, but squishy on some environmental, tax, and health care issues. In his 12 years in Sacramento, he‚Äôs taken $42K in fossil fuel money and voted against a 2014 moratorium on fracking. But he hasn‚Äôt taken any oil money this election and pledged not to. He‚Äôs also taken $200K from drug companies since 2011, but he also pissed them off by sponsoring 2017‚Äôs SB17, the strongest drug pricing transparency law in the country. That led PHARMA to drop $200K opposing Hernandez for Lt. Governor (AKA the ‚ÄúLite Gov‚Äù). </span></p><p><strong>Ele</strong><strong>ni Kounalakis&nbsp;</strong><span>was Obama‚Äôs ambassador to Hungary, and like most ambassadors it seems like she got that appointment because she comes from money. Her family made a fortune in real estate, and she was the President of their company, AKT Development. Her family has dropped $8 million on this race (her first run for office)! It rubs us the wrong way when rich people blow millions promoting their own campaigns--especially when they‚Äôre not championing specific issues. If she wanted to spend that mone</span>y to make herself a leader, why couldn‚Äôt Kounalakis have spent that money on making herself the face of a progressive ballot measure? Probably the most substantive role the Lite Gov holds is a seat on the State Lands Commission. We‚Äôre concerned the Kounalakis family‚Äôs real estate interests could present conflicts of interest there. Climate activists are also upset that she‚Äôs taken in hundreds of thousands from the Western States Petroleum Association who are tenants in one of her Sacramento buildings. She says that money is now being directed to a foundation to fight climate change.</p><p><span>Both of these candidates talk good games on issues like making college affordable, protecting the climate, and building affordable housing. They would both probably be fine at this do-nothing job. Neither of them are the type of transformative, people-power-focused leader we‚Äôre looking for. So we‚Äôre going with Ed Hernandez because he gives us a better idea of what to expect from him. </span></p><p><em><span>Side note: the lieutenant governor used to serve as </span></em><a href="https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2014/12/unlocking-history-explore-san-quentin-the-states-oldest-prison/"><em><span>warden at San Quentin</span></em></a><em><span>.

In the 2014 Controller primary we supported progressive Democratic candidate John Perez, but Betty Yee and the Republican were the top two vote getters and so we endorsed Yee in the November race. She won 53%-47%. Since then, she‚Äôs been an honest and capable civil servant who‚Äôs not afraid of rocking the boat when necessary. Just this year, she backed calls by Sacramento legislators to expand sexual harassment training throughout the capital. In July, Yee appointed a Sierra Club board member to the Clean Energy Jobs Act Citizens Oversight Board. Her challenger is an anti-tax Republican backed by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. &nbsp;üôÑ </span><strong>Vote Betty Yee for State Controller!</strong></p><p><span><a href="#top">^Back to Top</a></span></p><p><strong>State Treasurer: Fiona Ma&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/pile-of-poo/">üí©</a><a href="https://emojipedia.org/confused-face/">üòï</a>üí©</span></strong></p><p><strong>Fiona Ma</strong><span> has climbed the political ladder from the SF Board of Supervisors to the State Assembly to the Board of Equalization, and now she‚Äôs poised to be California‚Äôs next Treasurer. She was part of the conservative block on the Board of Supes and was somewhere between </span><a href="https://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/58414/fiona-ma"><span>decent</span></a><span> and </span><a href="http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/04/08/pay-play/"><span>awful</span></a><span> in the Assembly. We‚Äôre no fans of the Board of Equalization as a legislative body, but it seems like she‚Äôs been decent there. We give her credit for calling for the audit that revealed what a shitshow that board is, and we‚Äôre glad she‚Äôs </span><a href="https://capitalandmain.com/the-amazon-tax-ruling-disrupting-the-disruptors-0710"><span>supporting the ‚ÄúAmazon Tax‚Äù</span></a><span> at the state level. And her history as a CPA does give her some basic qualification for balancing the State‚Äôs books. But when push comes to shove, we question whether she would stand up against the big money that has funded all of her campaigns. </span></p><p><span>Her opponent is </span><strong>Greg Conlon</strong><span>, an old-school Republican who is also a CPA and was appointed to a couple of commissions by Republican Governor Pete Wilson. One of his big policy ideas is to cut the income tax on start-ups. No thanks.</span></p><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong><span>We‚Äôre pissed off that Fiona Ma refuses to rescind her endorsement of Josephine Zhao for School Board. Zhao </span><a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/school-board-candidate-fire-past-transphobic-statements/"><span>campaigned against gender-neutral bathrooms in schools</span></a><span> using transphobic language back in 2013.

He‚Äôs the first Latino Attorney General and is widely seen as leading the ‚ÄúCalifornia resistance,‚Äù filing tons of lawsuits against the Trump administration - about the travel ban, DACA, the border wall, sanctuary cities, birth control, the ban on trans people in the military, student loans, etc.</span></p><p><span>Becerra beat out Sanders-style candidate Dave Jones in the June primary, and we found both of these candidates inspiring!

They manage a $250 million dollar budget regulating a $300 billion dollar industry. The Insurance Commissioner is responsible for regulating healthcare insurance companies, investigating insurance fraud, and will also be tasked with deciding who pays for utility-caused wildfires in California.</span></p><p><span>Ricardo Lara was the first openly gay person of color elected to the California Senate in 2012. He‚Äôs a six-year Democratic State Senator for Long Beach and parts of Los Angeles. He's a statewide lefty, having served in the Assembly and previously worked for Kevin de Leon as his communications director. He's vice-chair of the California LGBT Caucus. His focus has been the California resistance to Trump and single payer healthcare. He authored the 2015 law that allows all low-income undocumented children and youth to enroll in full-scope Medi-Cal. In 2017, he introduced SB 562, a bill that would have brought universal healthcare to California. We thought Lara might be to the right of Dave Jones in the area of consumer protections, but he‚Äôs talking more about it, especially with the national Consumer Protection Agency at risk of being gutted by Trump.</span></p><p><span>Lara is facing off against Republican-turned-independent Steve Poizner, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and co-founder of the California Charter School Association. Poizner is running as an Independent to avoid the Republican stigma- but previously served as Insurance Commissioner as a Republican from 2007-2011, preceding Dave Jones. He ran for Governor in 2010 but was defeated in the primary by Meg Whitman, running on a platform of stopping "taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants". He's one of two Republicans to win statewide office in the last few decades (the other was Schwarzenegger), so even in today‚Äôs anti-Trump California, there‚Äôs a chance he‚Äôll get elected. Poizner says he's come around on immigration and wants to get everyone on a path to being documented, but he‚Äôs still talking about protecting the insurance companies‚Äô interests framed as protecting consumers. Poizner actually got more votes in the primary. YIKES! </span><strong>Vote Ricardo Lara for Insurance Commissioner!</strong><span><br></span></p><p><span><a href="#top">^Back to Top</a></span></p><p><strong>Board of Equalization, District 2: Malia Cohen&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/pile-of-poo/">üí©</a><a href="https://emojipedia.org/confused-face/">üòï</a>üí©</span></strong></p><p><span>In the June primary, we didn‚Äôt endorse D10 Sup. Malia Cohen. As we said in June, the Board of Equalization is problematic to the point that we‚Äôd like to see it eliminated. Until that happens, the office is mostly held by political climbers who need to keep a seat warm. Local progressives, including the League, have been pissed at Cohen for flip-flopping her position on Prop 10. On her questionnaire for the League and several other groups, she said she would support the repeal of Costa-Hawkins, yet when a resolution came before the Board of Supes, she first voted against it and blamed tenant advocates for not explaining it to her. She eventually voted for it, but her lack of knowledge about this crucial area is troubling. We‚Äôll vote Cohen for now, but if she‚Äôs elected, we‚Äôll keep an eye on her and hold her accountable.</span></p><p><span><a href="#top">^Back to Top</a></span></p><p><strong>U.S. Senator: Kevin de Le√≥n</strong><strong></strong></p><p><span>Five-term CA Senator <strong>Dianne Feinstein</strong> is being challenged by State Senator <strong>Kevin de Le√≥n</strong>, who says he was inspired to run by Feinstein‚Äôs comments that Trump could be a ‚Äúgood president‚Äù if given a chance.</span><strong></strong></p><p><span>As the first in his family to graduate from high school or college, de Le√≥n understands the struggles of working families. He started out as a community organizer and public school advocate where he fought for access to healthcare for children before being elected to the California State Assembly. A strong advocate for workers, de Le√≥n worked to increase the minimum wage, create retirement security for millions of future retirees, and pass wage theft legislation.</span><strong></strong></p><p><span>That would be a big change in personal background and perspective from Feinstein.

The day after Trump was elected de Le√≥n issued a strong statement saying that California was ready to resist and defend all of our communities from the administration.

We respect all that Pelosi has done for the national Democratic Party. She raises massive amounts of money, and her skill as a legislator and vote wrangler were key to passing Obamacare. But in all of our years following her, she‚Äôs been AWOL on almost all SF-specific issues.

We're also concerned about how Republicans love to use Pelosi as a boogeyman against all Democrats. There‚Äôs a lot of bullshit sexism wrapped up in that, but we can‚Äôt deny that Pelosi‚Äôs persona conveys a sense of wealthy, establishment, coastal elitism that turns a lot of people off. Lastly, she‚Äôs held this seat since 1987!

David Chiu, our old sparring buddy from his days as the moderate president of the SF Board of Supervisors, is cruising to re-election. Chiu‚Äôs been ok in Sacramento (like, he only low-key sucks). We wish he would grow a spine! One example: AB 1506 sought to repeal the 1995 Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act (the law that prevents SF from passing rent control on anything built after 1979). Chiu was a co-author of the bill, so that‚Äôs good...but he‚Äôs the chair of the Assembly Housing Committee and was dragging his feet so long on calling for a vote that tenants rights organizations posted a 45-day eviction notice on his office door in Sacramento! It‚Äôs like he wants progressive cred without having to actually take hard stances. FWIW, the pressure worked and he moved the bill forward, though it failed as expected. Repealing Costa Hawkins is on the ballot this election, and we hope it passes. Anyway, Chiu, if you‚Äôre listening, plz fight for something that will help at home? K thx. One major addition this election: w.t.a.f. is up with Chiu opposing Prop C?

An Emerge CA graduate, she‚Äôs also mostly aligned with the League. She supports many of our fave progressive candidates, but she‚Äôs identified endorsements of candidates that we‚Äôd likely never support. </span></p><p><span>All of the incumbents are committed to making City College truly free, increasing student enrollment, and addressing the aging facilities in dire need of modernization.

It‚Äôs worth noting that Janice answered in her questionnaire that she supported herself and William. </span></p><p><span><strong>William Walker</strong> received an endorsement from the League before when he ran for College Board. He told the League he identifies as a ‚Äúnative born, disabled, gay, African American male who lived in a majority person of color neighborhood only two blocks from a BART station and one block from a freeway, with all of the negative externalities that that causes.‚Äù When we talk about much needed diversity on the BART Board, this hits the nail on the head. William comes from a union family, and we could be sure he‚Äôd protect workers in the next contract negotiations.</span></p><p><span><strong>Jonathan Lyens</strong> identifies as a person with a disability (blindness), and he brings this to the forefront of issues he‚Äôs passionate about. BART has serious access issues, and he wants to tackle that along with loss in ridership and pushing for budget stability.

She helped Carver Elementary get $1.9 million in improvements, organized against charter co-location, and worked for modern, inclusive middle school reading lists in her children's own schools.

If elected, she would be the first Latina on the SF‚Äôs Board of Ed in 20 years! Lopez wants to address racial segregation within the school assignment system using solutions like online applications and virtual tours, which would allow families who can‚Äôt make it to daytime tours to explore more schools.

It funded severely underfunded county mental health services. In 2016, the California Legislature created the No Place Like Home program to build and rehab housing for residents with mental illness who are homeless or at-risk of becoming homeless. Prop 2 allows the state to use up to $140 million per year of county mental health funds to repay up to $2 billion in bonds.</span></p><p><span>No Place Like Home is currently hung up in the courts. The State needs to plan to approve whether using Mental Health Services Act dollars to pay for No Place Like Home goes along with what the voters wanted when it was first approved in 2004.

If Prop 2 passes, it‚Äôs all good and the court case is moot. </span></p><p><span>Ideally, there would be a new revenue stream for housing for homeless folks with mental health issues.

Along the way, the canal provides supplies to Fresno, Orange Cove and Lindsay, as well as irrigation districts that serve much of the farmers on the Valley‚Äôs eastside. Last year the Friant Water Authority discovered that land had fallen by as much as two feet along the canal near Corcoran.

But the plan for how they‚Äôll use the $1.5 billion it will raise checks out:</span></p><ul><li><span>72% ($1.08 billion) to seven nonprofit hospitals providing comprehensive services to high volumes of children eligible for governmental programs and children with special health needs eligible for California Children‚Äôs Services. </span></li><li><span>18% ($270 million) to the five University of California general acute hospitals with children‚Äôs hospitals: U.C. Davis, LA, Irvine, SF, and San Diego.</span></li><li><span>10% ($150 million) to public and private hospitals that provide pediatric services to children eligible for California Children‚Äôs Services.</span></li></ul><p><span>The funds could be used for constructing, expanding, remodeling, renovating, furnishing, equipping, financing, or refinancing. Those types of one-time, long-term uses are appropriate for bond funding (i.e. taking out a loan), as opposed to ongoing uses like programs and salaries that shouldn‚Äôt be paid for with bonds. </span></p><p><span>Hospitals would submit applications for funding to the California Health Facilities Financing Authority. The CHFFA consists of state Treasurer, Controller, Director of Finance, and five appointees. CHFFA would decide how to award the funds. Criteria include how the grant would expand care, how much uncompensated care and care to vulnerable populations the hospital offers, and the readiness of the project. None of the hospitals could get more than 20% of the total funds for their category unless there are leftover funds after 2033. </span></p><p><span>This would be the third children‚Äôs hospital bond we‚Äôve passed in the last 14 years: 2004 Prop 61 for $750M and 2008 Prop 3 for $980M.&nbsp;</span><strong>We say yes on Prop 4. Do it for the kids!</strong></p><p><span><a href="#top">^Back to Top</a></span></p><p><strong>Prop 5: Expand Prop 13 for Property Owners: HELL NO</strong></p><p><span>Prop 5 was brought to the ballot by the California Association of Realtors to ‚Äúprotect Prop 13 savings.‚Äù It removes the a number of restrictions that allow homeowners to transfer their property tax base to a ‚Äúreplacement residence‚Äù of greater value without increasing their property tax. </span></p><p><span>The Legislative Analyst‚Äôs Office found that </span><strong>schools and local governments would lose over $100 million in annual property taxes early on, growing to about $1 billion per year. </strong><span>There would also be similar increase in state costs to backfill the school property tax losses.</span></p><p><span>How does this work? A </span><a href="https://lao.ca.gov/ballot/2018/prop5-110618.pdf"><span>property tax primer</span></a><span> from the Legislative Analyst‚Äôs Office: </span></p><ul><li><span>Local governments levy taxes on property owners (cities, schools, special districts) based on the value of their property. </span></li><li><span>Each property owner‚Äôs annual property tax bill is equal to the taxable value of his or her property multiplied by the property tax rate (typically 1.1%). In the year a property is purchased (that part is key), its taxable value is its purchase price. Each year after that the property‚Äôs taxable value is adjusted for inflation by up to 2 percent. This continues until the property is sold and again is taxed at its purchase price.</span></li><li><span>If you move, you will face increased property tax bills because the market value of most homes (what they could be sold for) grows faster than 2 percent annually. This means the taxable value of most homes is less than their market value. Because of this, when a homeowner buys a different home, the purchase price of the new home often exceeds the taxable value of the buyer‚Äôs prior home (even when the homes have similar market values). This leads to a higher property tax bill for the home buyer.</span></li><li><span>There are special cases when homeowners can move to a different home without paying higher property taxes -- these apply to homeowners who are over 55 or severely disabled or whose property has been impacted by a natural disaster or contamination. When moving within the same county, an eligible homeowner can transfer the taxable value of his or her existing home to a different home if the market value of the new home is the same or less than the existing home. Also, a county government may allow eligible homeowners to transfer their taxable values to homes in the county from homes in different counties. Ten counties allow these transfers. Except in limited cases, homeowners who are over 55 or severely disabled can transfer their taxable value once in their lifetime. </span></li></ul><p><span>So, Prop 5 throws the rules out the window. It makes it so that ALL homeowners over 55 can transfer their oh-so-low property tax rate to their new nicer bigger better anywhere in the state home and not pay a higher tax rate. If you buy a less expensive home, it reduces your tax rate. And, this strips the rules that say you can only do this once. It essentially expands Prop 13. Uggggh.

But the Daylight Saving Time debate at our endorsement meeting surprised the hell out of us! Our membership displayed a ton of opposition to the annual practice of setting the clock forward in Spring and back in Fall. Every state in the US observes daylight saving time (DST) except Hawaii, Arizona (minus the Navajo Nation in the northeastern part of the state), American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Indiana was exempt before but began practicing daylight saving time in 2006. </span></p><p><span>Technically, Prop 7 doesn‚Äôt eliminate DST. It actually freezes it in place securing the best dawn and dusk times year round. Daylight saving time lasts for a total of 34 weeks (238 days) every year, about 65% of the entire year. The history of DST has been traced back to a 1784 essay by Benjamin Franklin, ‚ÄúAn Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost of Light‚Äù, claiming Parisians could save on candles by getting out of bed earlier in the morning, making use of the natural morning light instead. It began in 1918 in the US for the same official fuel saving reasons.

The real reason it is around is because of capitalism -- shopping. California adopted DST in 1949. Studies show DST has negatively affected public health by leading to more traffic accidents, workplace injuries and heart attacks. Teachers hella hate DST for the impacts on students.

Allow Expansion of Rent Control! HELL YES</strong></p><p><span>This fulfils a tenant advocate dream: it repeals Costa-Hawkins, an awful 1995 law that severely constricts cities‚Äô ability to expand or modernize rent control. Prop 10 doesn‚Äôt directly expand rent control - but it gives individual cities and counties the ability to do so. Tenant advocates have tried to reform or repeal Costa-Hawkins through the state legislature for years, but realtors and landlords have way more power than tenants in Sacramento, so that‚Äôs why this had to go to the ballot.</span></p><p><a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/topstories/costa-hawkins-overturned/"><span>This SF Weekly story</span></a><span> talks about what would be on the table if Prop 10 passes. Some highlights:</span></p><ul><li><span>Expand rent control to buildings built after 1979. Berkeley‚Äôs plan to implement rent control on a rolling basis 20 years after a building is built sounds solid to us.</span></li><li><span>Implement ‚Äúvacancy control‚Äù to limit how much landlords can raise the rent when tenants move out.</span></li><li><span>Limit rent increases when master tenants leave. So scummy landlords can‚Äôt jack up the rent when a renter dies and their surviving spouse isn‚Äôt on the lease! Yeah, they do that. ‚òπÔ∏è</span></li></ul><p><span>Costa-Hawkins prevents us from doing </span><em><span>any</span></em><span> of that, which has allowed landlords to hugely jack up rents and displace thousands of our neighbors. Most California renters spend over 30% of their income on housing. For some, it‚Äôs worse than that: a third are forking over 50% of their pay to their landlords! Prop 10 is the first step to reign in the most absurd rent hikes from the greediest landlords. </span></p><p><span>In our City where home ownership grows farther out of reach for most us, our ability to remain San Franciscans depends on having stable rent. There‚Äôs really no policy alternative to rent control for promoting housing stability. And a </span><a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/Rent_Matters_PERE_Report_Final_02.pdf"><span>recent USC study shows</span></a><span> how housing stability promotes physical, social, and psychological wellness, as well as educational attainment for students.</span></p><p><span>As for all the scaremongering from opponents, we think their arguments range from overblown to flat-out bullshit. Let‚Äôs talk about the economists, shall we?</span></p><h3><strong>Are you concerned with what economists say about rent control? </strong></h3><p><span>Unfortunately, lots of economists like to hate on rent control. Let‚Äôs take a look.</span></p><p><strong>Argument #1: Economists say if we remove restrictions on rents and housing construction, the efficiencies of the free market will eventually make housing more affordable.</strong><span> They acknowledge our housing crisis, but say expanding rent control will discourage developers from building more housing, because it might not be as profitable. </span><strong>Sooo they‚Äôre saying the way to lower housing costs is to make sure developers and landlords can raise rents as much as possible?!</strong><span> Maaaybe that would work out over a 30-50 year timeframe, if you let developers and landlords maximize their profits, they‚Äôd eventually build enough housing that rents would come down. But we doubt it: as soon as their financiers see that rents are stabilizing or dropping, they‚Äôll stop funding new construction and invest in something else. Meanwhile, another generation or two of working class folks will be displaced by skyrocketing rent increases.</span></p><p><span>Economists studied what happened when Cambridge, MA repealed rent control in 1995. </span><a href="https://www.citywatchla.com/index.php/los-angeles/15597-rent-control-keeps-prices-down-for-everyone-here-s-why"><span>This City Watch LA article</span></a><span> links to a lot of that research. Tl;dr it wasn‚Äôt good. While new construction increased some, rents skyrocketed--in both previously regulated and unregulated units--evictions increased by 33% and 40% of residents in previously rent controlled units moved out.</span></p><p><span>The reality is that out-of-control rents in urban California are making landlords rich and prompting developers to build as much housing as they can. Nobody is proposing that rent control should apply to newly constructed buildings--instead the debate is how long to wait for it to kick in: 20 years? 30 years? There are much bigger factors that determine if housing developments pencil out: the skyrocketing costs of materials and labor, zoning restrictions on where and how much housing can be built, and how much affordable housing they‚Äôre required to build. The effects of rent control is decimal dust compared to all of that.</span></p><p><strong>Argument #2: Economists say rent control encourages landlords to convert rental units to condos or tenancies-in-common.</strong><span> A recent Stanford study of rent control in SF said this was the most damaging part of rent control, because it led to a 15% decrease in the supply of rental housing. But let‚Äôs think about that. Rent control is a policy to stop speculators from making housing too expensive. Condo conversion is a way speculators profit by getting around rent control. If our policy goal is to keep housing affordable, the solution is NOT to throw out rent control because there are loopholes. The solution is to plug the loopholes! And that‚Äôs exactly what tenant advocates in San Francisco have done over the past two decades, limiting the ability to </span><a href="https://www.sftu.org/newtic/"><span>convert units to condos</span></a><span> or to </span><a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/planning-commission-oks-law-to-tighten-restrictions-for-removing-residential-units/"><span>demolish, merger, or convert existing housing</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, opponents argue that rent control motivates landlords to keep units off the market. When studios in SF start around $2K/month, we don‚Äôt understand why anyone would keep a unit off the market. They‚Äôre friggin‚Äô goldmines! But if that is still a widespread problem, again the solution isn‚Äôt to get rid of rent control. Let‚Äôs try educating landlords, and if that doesn‚Äôt work, let‚Äôs tax or regulate vacant units.</span></p><p><strong>Argument #3: Rent control should be means tested.</strong><span> ‚ÄúMeans testing‚Äù means rent control should apply only to low-income tenants. But if we did that, it would create huge incentives for landlords to evict and/or not rent to low-income tenants so that they could charge higher rents. As the </span><a href="https://haasinstitute.berkeley.edu/opening-door-rent-control"><span>Haas Institute study</span></a><span> puts it, </span><span>‚Äúthere is no more reason to limit the benefits of rent control to the lowest-income tenants than there is to limit the benefits of public utility regulation to only the lowest-income users of </span><span>electricity and water.‚Äù The lack of means testing also increases the overall economic benefit of rent control: by limiting rent increases on middle and upper class tenants, it puts more money in their pockets to spend on other stuff instead of lining the pockets of their landlords. Economics!</span></p><p><span>We appreciate the value economic brings in analyzing public policy challenges, but just a reminder that economics is</span><a href="https://spectator.org/is-economics-a-hard-science/"><span>not a hard science</span><em><span>‚Äî</span></em><span>it‚Äôs a social science</span></a><span> that has</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2013/03/18/finally-economists-acknowledge-that-theyre-biased/#6c7191d31f57"><span>been shown</span></a><span> to be</span><a href="https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21737070-male-economists-are-both-more-right-wing-and-more-senior-men-and-women-economics"><span>subject</span></a><span> to</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/nobel-factor-offer-soderberg/503186/"><span>bias</span></a><span>. And we know that expanding rent control isn‚Äôt a magic wand that will solve the housing crisis. Of course we need to build a lot more housing. But rent control is a crucial tool for providing stability in our housing, and it‚Äôs a key piece of creating a society where housing is less of an investment and more of a human right.</span></p><p><span>Not convinced?

It was put on the ballot by a private ambulance company, American Medical Response (AMR). </span></p><p><span>This all started back in 2012 when EMTs in San Diego filed a class-action lawsuit, </span><a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1861806.html"><span>Bartoni vs. American Medical Response West</span></a><span>, for missed meals and uncompensated interrupted breaks.

It said that ‚Äúbreeding pigs‚Äù (so females of breeding age, excludes all males and young pigs), veal calves, and egg hens needed to have enough space to turn around, spread their wings, etc. That didn‚Äôt take effect till 2015 (and egg prices did go up then as a consequence, though they‚Äôve lowered since). </span></p><p><span>This prop basically takes that to the next step. For hens it increases the amount of space slightly (from 116 square inches, more or less, to 144, one square foot), and slowly phases in a set of guidelines requiring egg-laying hens to be kept in a ‚Äúcage free‚Äù environment. And it slowly phases in what are basically cage-free environments for breeding pigs and veal calves. It doesn‚Äôt cover older cows or other animals. </span></p><p><span>Enforcement of standards in this field is lacking, and will remain so. While the prop does authorize the CA Dept of Agriculture to enforce this, logistics means that constantly checking all the relevant farms would be nearly impossible. But presumably Prop 12 will cause a slow transition as law-abiding farmers start to comply and farms upgrade or build new equipment in compliance with the new standards.</span></p><p><span>Prop 12 will probably raise the cost of meat and eggs, but kicks in slowly to give consumers and farmers a chance to adjust. This is one of those issues on which CA can lead the nation, since standards like this tend to spread, and companies want to streamline their operations and sell across borders. A big egg farm in the Midwest that sells eggs in CA, for instance, would have to comply with this.</span></p><p><span>PETA opposes this for some weird reason, but Humane Society is supporting. Overall, while we‚Äôre hesitant to increase food costs, better conditions for animals also leads to healthier food. We support Prop 12.</span></p><p>UPDATE: Shout out to the Leaguer who emailed PETA directly to ask why they opposed Prop 12. They say: "As you know, PETA works to end the use of animals for food and encourages everyone to go vegan‚Äîbut in addition to that, we've pushed for and supported incremental changes to lessen farmed animals' suffering. We see Prop 12, however, as a dangerous step in the wrong direction....While Prop 12 would ultimately abolish cages, it would also allow tens of thousands of hens to be confined to massive sheds with no more than 1 square foot of space per bird."</p><p><span><a href="#top">^Back to Top</a></span></p><h3>San Francisco Propositions</h3><p><strong>Prop A: $425M Bond to Start Rebuilding the Seawall: YES</strong></p><p><span>This initiative is critically important to prevent loss of life and protect historic areas from earthquake and flooding due to sea level rise. The 100-year-old seawall covers 3 miles and needs major reconstruction in order to protect utility networks, BART, MUNI, and the launching area for ferries. In case of disaster, boats and ferries would have to be able to launch and dock here. The danger from earthquake, liquefaction and flooding affects Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf, AT&amp;T Park, Third Street, and Bayview/Hunters Point. If there‚Äôs an earthquake at high tide with a surge, BART could be flooded and closed for multiple years. Looking at the storm devastation on the East Coast, we need to be prepared sooner instead of later.</span></p><p><span>Ultimately this needs to be a $5 billion dollar project, but will only help if we complete it before the major earthquake that is predicted within the next 30 years. Prop A is only the first stage: it would raise $425 million from property owners and tenants to handle the most critical projects, and generate matching funds from state and federal sources for more scratch. </span></p><p><span>While we support it because of the urgency of the need, there are a couple problems with the bond. First, the Tenants Union opposes it because landlords will be able to pass on 50% of this increase in property tax to renters. Those passthroughs tend to be pretty small, but we agree on the principle that landlords who have seen their property values skyrocket should be able to handle a small bump in their taxes.</span></p><p><span>Second, at some point during the process of writing the Prop, protection of Bayview/Hunters Point got taken out of the proposal, so it only covers as far as AT&amp;T park. On top of the radioactive shipyard, BVHP has already been hit with enough environmental racism, so failing to protect the district‚Äôs seawall is an added insult. We‚Äôll be watching to be sure the next bond phase includes our BVHP neighbors. </span><strong>Yes on Prop A.</strong></p><p><span><a href="#top">^Back to Top</a></span></p><p><strong>Prop B: Privacy First Policy: YES</strong></p><p><span>Screw mass surveillance and surveillance capitalism! It‚Äôs about time we put some controls on the collection and commodification of our personal data. If passed, Proposition B would be an important first step towards crafting much-needed privacy protections for SF residents and visitors. Just to be clear, Proposition B doesn‚Äôt establish specific data protection ordinances (city officials have until May 31, 2019 to develop those), but it establishes Privacy First principles for the city to follow when developing such policies. These principles include allowing</span><span> individuals to </span><span>access the personal information collected about them, providing individuals with a way to correct data inaccuracies, and allowing individuals to move through the city without their location being tracked. Importantly, the Privacy First Policy would not only apply to all city departments, but also to any company that does business with the city. </span></p><p><span>There‚Äôs one tricky piece of this - it allows the Board of Supervisors to make changes to the City‚Äôs government transparency law, the Sunshine Ordinance, which was passed by voters back in 1999. Currently, since it was passed by voters, it can only be altered by proposition, and Prop B changes that. Some sunshine advocates have asked for this ability to make it easier to modify the Sunshine ordinance without having to go to the ballot. (For example, one seat on the Sunshine Taskforce needs to be nominated by New America Media, but that group is now defunct! Currently the only way to change that would be through a ballot measure.)

The City Attorney has said he won‚Äôt sign off on anything that isn‚Äôt consistent with the ordinance‚Äôs purpose linked above. We wouldn‚Äôt put it past some shady future Supervisors to try to weaken our open government laws. But here‚Äôs the thing: enforcement of the Sunshine Ordinance is so spotty, politicians don‚Äôt need to weaken it to get around it. </span><a href="https://missionlocal.org/2018/05/london-breed-continually-flouts-public-records-law-district-attorney-now-involved/"><span>Mayor London Breed has repeatedly flouted the Sunshine Ordinance with zero consequences</span></a><span>! This is a great example of how you can‚Äôt legislate future political will.

Half of that will build and acquire permanent housing, a quarter will go to mental health and substance abuse treatment, and the last fourth goes to homelessness prevention, temporary shelters, and hygiene centers.

That‚Äôs the amount spent on rental subsidies, eviction prevention and permanent supportive housing [services aimed at preventing people from becoming homeless or to house the formerly homeless]...Take away 11 percent for administrative costs and one-time capital spending, and you‚Äôre left with 17.6 percent spent on temporary shelters, 3.2 percent on street outreach and 2.2 percent on health services. That means about $57 million was spent on the visible homeless population, the group of people we see every day who so clearly need help‚Ä¶‚Äù &nbsp;Over the course of a year, 20,000 people will be homeless in San Francisco, Kositsky said, adding that 5,000 of those won‚Äôt use city services because they figure out their own housing arrangements or are just passing through. ‚ÄúBut divide $57 million by 15,000 homeless people who need city help each year, and you see the city spends $3,800 per person per year.

To give you an idea of how many jobs Egan believes are going to be vanquished by Prop. C, if the city would have created 1,000 jobs in a Prop. C-free environment, the report predicts Prop.

It consists of an 8% base tax and an additional 6% tax surcharge on hotel room rentals. The Allocation of Hotel Tax Funds measure in the November 2016 election, Prop S, would have allocated funds from the existing SF Hotel Tax to be used to fund arts and cultural programs, as well as services for homeless families, but it didn‚Äôt pass - it got a majority but just barely failed to clear the 66.67% threshold. </span></p><p><span>After Prop S failed, the contingents working on funding for the arts and those working to fund homeless services split off to develop two complementary measures for the 2018 election, which we are now voting on as Prop C and Prop E. This one, Prop E, would require 1.5% of the 8% base tax to be allocated to the arts and cultural causes as specified in the bill, with the remaining 6.5% to continue going toward the general fund. The allocation as specified by the text of this measure would be split between non-profit cultural organizations, the SF Arts Commission, and the Mayor‚Äôs Office of Housing and Community Development for use by Cultural Districts. We talk about San Francisco as a city of artists, but we need to support arts communities with actual funding as it becomes more and more difficult for artists to stay here. We appreciate that some of the money will be used to fund cultural districts, which help &nbsp;preserve unique communities in San Francisco. <strong>Yes on E.</strong></span></p><p><span><a href="#top">^Back to Top</a></span></p><h3>San Francisco Offices</h3><p><strong>Assessor-Recorder: Paul Bellar</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.theleaguesf.org/november_2018_candidate_questionnaires">candidate questionnaires</a>)</p><p><span>Assessor-Recorder is not the sexiest of offices.

There is construction everywhere. The Assessor should be right there, ready to get the City its fair share, but instead there‚Äôs a huge backlog of assessable new construction. Tall Paul‚Äôs goal [he really is friggin‚Äô tall] is to move away from the taxes-only model and push the office to dig deeper into understanding San Francisco‚Äôs housing landscape - just what exactly are we taxing? And, in a Prop 13 constrained world, how can SF collect what‚Äôs due?</span></p><p><span>In a damning 2015 </span><a href="http://civilgrandjury.sfgov.org/2014_2015/14-15_CGJ_OAR_Report-Court_Approved.pdf"><span>civil grand jury report</span></a><span> entitled ‚ÄúOffice of the Assessor-Recorder: Despite Progress, Still The Lowest Rated Office in the State‚Äù (ouch) the Office was called out for their inefficiency, which has led to ‚Äúdelays in the receipt of General Fund monies, a loss of&nbsp;</span><span>interest revenue for the County, and is a burden on taxpayers who might have to pay several years of back property tax at once.‚Äù The report said the Office needed to ‚Äúwork with&nbsp;</span><span>DBI in a more efficient manner.‚Äù That‚Äôs where Bellar says the rub is. The Office of Assessor-Recorder isn‚Äôt working with the Department of Building Inspections to collect the stats on the housing they‚Äôre taxing. They need the ‚Äòwhat‚Äô in the what/how/collect steps of collecting taxes. One egregious example is relying on developers‚Äô honesty to determine the tax rate of units under construction instead of having the City calculate it in the cost manual. </span></p><p><span>This shit is complicated, and the fix is in for a City Family-backed candidate, but </span><strong>we‚Äôre throwing our support behind Paul Bellar and you should too.</strong><span><br></span></p><p><strong><span>The incumbent, <strong>Carmen Chu</strong>, appears to be smart and competent.

His office successfully defended Jose Ines Garcia Zarate in a case that drew national attention. Despite enormous and deserved public sympathy for the victim, Kate Steinle, and widespread condemnation of Zarate, who is undocumented, SF‚Äôs Public Defender‚Äôs office (led by Chief Attorney and progressive heartthrob Matt Gonzalez) won an acquittal on all murder charges in what was clearly a tragic accidental death caused by Zarate, not a murder. What better way to say Fuck You to Donald Trump‚Äôs xenophobic immigration pogroms than to ensure the rule of law and justice for the indigent, regardless of immigration status? That‚Äôs what Adachi is all about- upholding the motherfucking constitution.</span></p><p><span>San Francisco is the only county in California that elects our Public Defender. This independence from appointment means that Adachi is free to piss people off. For example, his endorsement of London Breed for Mayor baffled us, and his pension reform legislation from 2011 which saw him buddy up with union-hating venture capitalists angered many union allies. But Jeff‚Äôs heart is in the right place. On his watch the PD‚Äôs office has become a powerhouse of badasses, fighting the Trump administration on immigration and providing constitutionally-required defense for all San Franciscans, regardless of income. Adachi has been a strong proponent of bail reform and for the need to address racial disparities in arrests and sentencing. Also, he‚Äôs running unopposed.

Having lived in and worked for District 2 for a long time, she probably knows the district better than any of the other candidates and would probably represent its residents well. Unfortunately, every single SF election shows D2 is dominated by conservative voters who don‚Äôt share our values. :/</span></p><p><span>In her short time on the Board, Stefani has been one of the strongest allies of the Police Officers Association and supported June‚Äôs Prop H, the POA‚Äôs awful ballot measure to loosen restrictions on tasers. The fact that she doesn‚Äôt see the nexus between gun violence and the POA‚Äôs advocacy for less restrictions on police violence is upsetting.

Womp, womp. </span></p><p><span>One thing you can‚Äôt deny about </span><strong>Nick Josefowitz</strong><span>: dude really really wants to be District 2 Supervisor. Before Farrell became interim Mayor and appointed Stefani, Josefowitz was concerned that former D2 Supe Michela Alioto-Pier would run again. So he dropped $400K trying to put a proposition on the June ballot to block her by changing the City‚Äôs term limit rules. (That effort failed, and the signature gathering firm says </span><a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/d2-supervisor-candidate-spars-consulting-firm-20k-alleged-debt/"><span>he stiffed them $20K</span></a><span>.) Then after Stefani was appointed, he went to court to try to move this election from November to June to give Stefani less time to campaign. Talk about putting his fragile masculinity front and center! </span></p><p><span>Josefowitz is currently on the BART Board of Directors, and we made the tough call of not endorsing him back then when he was running against SF‚Äôs last elected Republican! Here‚Äôs what we said then: </span></p><p><span>He wants to prioritize pedestrian and bike infrastructure around BART stations, run more frequent trains, upgrade cars and systems to improve efficiency and develop land owned by BART to help increase housing. But‚Ä¶. he‚Äôs not a supporter of the Anti-Speculation tax, he helped Mayor Lee bury CleanPowerSF when he was a Commissioner for the Dept of the Environment, and he rubber-stamped the Tech Bus Pilot without questioning the environmental impact. </span></p><p><span>We do appreciate that he‚Äôs been a strong advocate for bikes and transit. On his questionnaire, he told us his first priority would be to add 3,000 more homeless shelter beds, but like Stefani, he‚Äôs not supporting Prop C!

D4 has had a string of Supervisors appointed by the Mayor. The district hasn‚Äôt had an ‚Äúopen seat‚Äù election in 12 friggin years! When Edmund Jew went to jail in 2007, Gavin Newsom appointed Carmen Chu from his budget office. Then in 2013, Ed Lee appointed Chu to become Assessor-Recorder, and appointed Katy Tang (Chu‚Äôs aide) to become D4 Supervisor!

She previously worked for an LA County Supervisor and for the Department of Social Services in Sacramento, but her lack of San Francisco experience is concerning. She didn‚Äôt have the voting history or legislative knowledge to answer the bulk of our questionnaire, but what we do know about her positions is pretty concerning.

That‚Äôs also where her biggest red flag comes from: </span><a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/news/planning-commissioner-changed-airbnb-vote-after-text-from-mayors-office/"><span>she literally changed her vote on enforceable AirBnB regulations</span></a><span> after the Mayor‚Äôs office texted her freaking out about it. (<strong>Update:&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.theleaguesf.org/christine_johnson_airbnb">check out the video</a> of how she changed her vote without explanation.) For us, that‚Äôs disqualifying. She didn‚Äôt answer our questionnaire, so we don‚Äôt know her positions on a lot of things we care about, but she came out against Prop 10, which is also a dealbreaker for us. And she‚Äôs also supported by tons of people we don‚Äôt trust like the Police Officers Association and Republican socialite Dede Wilsey. </span></p><p><span>Although her campaign has the least momentum, the endorsement by London Breed and the recent air-tight alliance with Sonja Trauss may boost her status a bit. She served on the Hunter‚Äôs Point Shipyard Community Advisory Committee. We‚Äôre concerned she may be looking after the interests of the corporations that will profit from development there. The </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-Mayor-Breed-endorses-school-teacher-Trevor-13303373.php"><span>Police Officers‚Äô Association (POA) has endorsed</span></a><span> Trauss &amp; Johnson.

In addition, Progress SF, the independent expenditure funded by tech investor Ron Conway that propelled London Breed into office, have dropped $250,000 and counting into an effort to support Trauss/Johnson.</span></p><p><span><strong>Sonja Trauss</strong> catapulted to international fame through her work organizing BARF (Bay Area Renters Federation) whose unfortunate name gave way to the YIMBY (Yes In My Back Yard) network, which has received </span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/03/pro-development-yimby-group-scores-1-million-from-stripe-tackle-housing-shortage/"><span>hundreds</span></a><span> of </span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2015/03/pro-density-sfbarf-yelp-jeremy-stoppelman.html"><span>thousands</span></a><span> of dollars from tech CEOs investing in politics statewide. Our members have some differing opinions on her. We understand why people are inspired by her focus on the need for San Francisco, California, and the world to build a ton more housing. (See our opinion on the housing crisis </span><a href="http://www.theleaguesf.org/housing"><span>here</span></a><span>.) Some of us think Trauss authentically believes that building more market-rate housing will benefit low-income communities. Some of us are suspicious of her funding from </span><a href="https://truthout.org/articles/yimbys-the-alt-right-darlings-of-the-real-estate-industry/"><span>realtors and tech companies</span></a><span> and alignment with moderates and conservatives with </span><a href="http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2014/07/11/city-will-turn-francisco-reservoir-park-no-affordable-housing/"><span>questionable housing records</span></a><span>. </span></p><p><span>We‚Äôve talked about how we‚Äôd like to see </span><a href="http://www.theleaguesf.org/housing"><span>progressives and YIMBYs work together</span></a><span> on an equitable and compassionate approach to building a lot of housing. But despite our internal difference of opinions on Trauss‚Äôs motivation, we‚Äôre all troubled by the divisiveness of her approach. Specifically, her history of offending low-income residents and communities of color and failing to acknowledge or apologize for her actions is a dealbreaker.

Luckily, he‚Äôs running virtually unopposed. Rafael is a longtime League ally, and has kept his promise to work with both moderates and progressives on the Board of Supervisors. We‚Äôre watching him on some of the more controversial positions that are sure to divide the Board this year. For example, we‚Äôre hoping </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Mandelman-doesn-t-have-answer-to-homelessness-13169891.php"><span>his views on conservatorship</span></a><span> are influenced by people we trust in the harm reduction and mental health treatment communities.</span></p><p><span>Here‚Äôs what we said in June when he was Trustee on the Community College Board:</span></p><p><span>Rafael‚Äôs personal story is so compelling. His mother struggled with mental illness and was homeless for most of his childhood. He moved to San Francisco when he was 11 to live with his grandmother, and then later families and teachers. These personal challenges have led him to support homeless and food-insecure students at City College, such as creating a food pantry and support system to help house homeless students.</span></p><p><span>Rafi‚Äôs career has been focused on helping cities and nonprofits build affordable housing. He also has tons of experience ‚Äî as a commissioner on the Board of Appeals, working for a walkable and bikeable city on the board of Livable City, as a Deputy City Attorney in Oakland, and as the Chair of the LGBT Center.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span><a href="#top">^Back to Top</a></span></p><p><strong>Board of Supervisors, District 10: #1 Tony Kelly #2 Uzuri Pease-Greene&nbsp;</strong>(<a href="http://www.theleaguesf.org/november_2018_candidate_questionnaires">candidate questionnaires</a>)</p><p><span>This is the third time we‚Äôve endorsed <strong>Tony Kelly #1&nbsp;</strong>for D10 - he just keeps on doing the work. Way back in 2010, we said this about him: ‚ÄúHe has the deepest roots of any of the candidates. A white, middle-aged theater company owner who is endorsed by some of the baddest black activists in Bayview/Hunters Point (like Marie Harrison, Sharon Hewitt, and Espanola Jackson). He's been part of the fight to keep District 10 home to working class people for years, and he's ready to take that fight to City Hall.‚Äù Espanola and Grandma Sharon are no longer with us, but Tony is still keeping up the good fight. He ran a strong campaign in 2014, and with an open seat this time, he‚Äôs got a good chance of winning.</span></p><p><span>We are frustrated that Tony got into a </span><a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/heated-exchange-race-erupts-two-district-10-supervisorial-candidates/"><span>heated exchange</span></a><span> with Shamann Walton at an SF Examiner editorial meeting around race and this election. We want to express disappointment in Tony‚Äôs use of the phrase, "race card." Representation is real. We are thankful that Tony apologized. As a white man running to represent an historically African-American district, we know Tony understands the importance of showing up, hearing criticism, and proving that he's an ally District 10's communities can trust.</span></p><p><span>District 10 is the next big money battleground for new, large-scale developments in the City. It‚Äôs also home to the environmental catastrophe of the falsified cleanup of radiation at the Hunters Point shipyard, for which the City, Navy, EPA, and contractor Tetra Tech all seem to share responsibility. After generations of disinvestment and environmental racism, with developers licking their chops, D10 needs a champion like Tony!</span></p><p><strong>#2 Uzuri Pease-Greene&nbsp;</strong><span>is a long-time community activist. She‚Äôs an inspiring leader who has experienced homelessness, gone through recovery, and now works as a community organizer for BRIDGE Housing on affordable housing projects, serves on the Police Chief‚Äôs advisory committee, and participates in tons of community building projects--and on top of that she‚Äôs a mother of eight and grandmother of thirteen!</span></p><p><span>We endorsed <strong>Shamann Walton&nbsp;</strong>for School Board, and by all accounts he‚Äôs been awesome since he was elected in 2014, standing up for equity and closing the opportunity gap. He has strong neighborhood ties as the head of Young Community Developers (YCD), a workforce development agency in Bayview-Hunters Point. A number of our members support him, but ultimately we are concerned about his willingness to stand up against the interests that will be pushing the next round of mega-developments in D10. </span></p><p><span>The Board of Supervisors is a very different job than the School Board, with much more pressure from lobbyists and big money. Shamann was one of the lead proponents of </span><a href="http://www.theleaguesf.org/nov_2016#propo"><span>2016‚Äôs Prop O</span></a><span>, which exempted Lennar‚Äôs BVHP project from the City‚Äôs cap on office space development without providing any additional community benefits. He also wrote a </span><a href="http://lennarconcord.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/YoungCommunityDevelopers_LennarRecommendation.pdf"><span>letter of recommendation</span></a><span> to Alameda County for Lennar (a developer with an appalling record of screwing over communities), based on the work YCD has done with them. Finally, his Ethics filings show lots of large contributions from businesses, real estate, political consultants, etc, many of them from outside of the district. We wish we could endorse him, but we can‚Äôt ignore the red flags.</span></p><p><strong>Theo Ellington&nbsp;</strong><span>works for the Warriors, and led their community engagement process for their new Mission Bay arena. On our <a href="http://www.theleaguesf.org/november_2018_candidate_questionnaires">questionnaire</a>, he left some key questions blank: Prop C--Our City Our Home, Supervisor Peskin‚Äôs tax on Uber and Lyft, and 2014‚Äôs Prop G anti-speculation tax. Failing to take stands on those types of strong progressive measures is a non-starter for us.
