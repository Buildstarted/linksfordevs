<p>Unfortunately, our run of good luck here down in Aus has taken a bit of a turn COVID wise. Not so much in my home state, but the southern states have been copping it so this week, I pulled the pin on snowboarding. For folks overseas, that might sound like it would have been a risky proposition anyway, but only two and a half weeks ago <a href="https://covidlive.com.au/report/daily-active-cases/nsw">the entire state of New South Wales had 5 active cases</a> out of 8.1M people. Today it's 209. It's neighbouring southern state of <a href="https://covidlive.com.au/report/daily-active-cases/vic">Victoria had 40 cases in the middle of last month</a>. Today they hit 5,385. It was just too risky for something that ultimately, is a luxury so I'm staying put in Queensland where we've had our own uptick, but so far it's only from 2 active cases earlier last week to 11 as of today. So far.</p><p>Back on business as usual, I've been processing a <em>ton</em> of breaches lately as the ShinyHunters data in particular has hit the public airwaves. There's a heap more to go yet too and I'm not even half way through so stay tuned to a lot more pwn notifications coming your way (sorry!) I also spend a bunch of time today talking about how and why I specced my version 2.0 office the way I did, especially given the way some of the commentary on Hacker News was worded. I found that kinda amusing, I hope you do too ðŸ˜Š</p><div><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/troy-hunts-weekly-update-podcast/id1176454699"><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/05/Listen-on-Apple-Podcasts.svg" alt="Listen on Apple Podcasts"></a></p><p><a href="https://playmusic.app.goo.gl/?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&amp;isi=691797987&amp;ius=googleplaymusic&amp;apn=com.google.android.music&amp;link=https://play.google.com/music/m/If3tw7npymckucxq4q76762ncny?t%3DTroy_Hunt%27s_Weekly_Update_Podcast%26pcampaignid%3DMKT-na-all-co-pr-mu-pod-16"><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/05/Get-it-on-Google-Play.svg" alt="Get it on Google Play"></a></p><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7jMtKFohdrw6qmz8AkLqit"><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/10/spotify.svg"></a></p><p><a href="https://omny.fm/shows/troy-hunt-weekly-update/playlists/podcast.rss"><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/07/Download-via-RSS.svg" alt="Download via RSS"></a></p><iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRRP_bSDVp8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><h3 id="references">References</h3><ol><li><a href="https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned">So many breaches...</a> (that's a link through to HIBP's Twitter timeline, check out the last week)</li><li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-leaks-386-million-user-records-from-18-companies-for-free/">A lot of these breaches have originated from ShinyHunters</a> (that Bleeping Computer piece gives a good overview of just how many recent breaches there's been)</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1288649019607015425">The Blackbaud situation is a real mess</a> (it's not just the number of companies impacted and now having to do their own disclosure notices, it's the way Blackbaud themselves have communicated it too)</li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23938124">There's a, uh, "interesting" thread on Hacker News about my new PC build</a> (it makes for entertaining reading, but it's also the basis of much of this week's video)</li><li><a href="https://varon.is/SecurityFWD1" rel="noopener">Sponsored by: SecurityFWD.
