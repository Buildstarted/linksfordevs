This workshop, sponsored by 
<a href="http://www.aimath.org/">AIM</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</a>, 
will be devoted to
developing and analyzing quantum algorithms to attack public-key
cryptosystems. It is known that systems based on factorization of
integers and discrete logarithms will be broken by quantum computers
in polynomial time. Other systems, typically based on coding theory,
hash functions, isogenies, lattices, or multivariate systems of
equations, are considered secure against quantum attacks, meaning that
the security scales at least super-polynomially and ideally
exponentially with the system parameters. However, the exact security
is largely unknown and there is a lack of exchange between researchers
in post-quantum cryptography and those in quantum algorithms.
</p><p>
The aim of this workshop is to establish a more intensive
collaboration between mathematicians working on designing and
analyzing public-key cryptosystems and computer scientists working on
quantum algorithms. Bringing together this expertise is essential to
ensure that current proposals in post-quantum cryptography, an area
working on alternatives to cryptography based on factorization and
discrete logarithms with the aim to find algorithms that withstand
attacks by quantum computers, actually get analyzed with the full
power of both fields.
</p><p>
The main topics for the workshop are
</p><ul>
<li> Exact security of ECC and RSA under quantum attacks

</li><li> Quantum algorithms for generic post-quantum systems

</li><li> Quantum algorithms for post-quantum systems with extra structure
</li></ul> 

<p>

This event will be run as an AIM-style workshop.
Participants will be invited to suggest open problems and questions
before the workshop begins, and these will be posted on the workshop
website. These include specific problems on which there is hope of
making some progress during the workshop,
as well as more ambitious problems which may influence
the future activity of the field.
Lectures at the
workshop will be focused on familiarizing the participants with the
background material leading up to specific problems, and the 
schedule will include discussion and parallel working sessions.
</p><p>

The deadline to apply for support to participate in this workshop has passed.
