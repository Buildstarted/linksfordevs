<p>The STOCK Act is an original bill to prohibit members of Congress and employees of Congress from using private information derived from their official positions for personal benefit, and for other purposes. With this bill in place, members of Congress are no longer allowed to use information garnered through official business for personal reasons. The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act prohibits members and employees of Congress from using "any nonpublic information derived from the individual's position ... or gained from performance of the individual's duties, for personal benefit". The bill also applies to all employees in the Executive and Judicial branches of the federal government. The STOCK Act requires a one-year study of the growing political intelligence industry, and requires every Member of Congress to publicly file and disclose any financial transaction of stocks, bond, commodities futures, and other securities within 45 days on their websites, rather than once a year as they do now. The Act also requires members of Congress and Executive branch officials to disclose the terms of mortgages on their homes, prohibits them from receiving special access to initial public stock offerings, and denies federal pensions to members of Congress who are convicted of felonies involving public corruption. The bill is divided into nineteen sections.<sup id="cite_ref-Procon.org_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-Procon.org-6">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Overall the STOCK Act has garnered positive support from both houses of Congress. STOCK will effectively put an end to congressional insider trading<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2020)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>. However, guarded optimism has been expressed by politicians such as Eric Weissmann. Weissman, a candidate for Congress in Colorado's 2nd Congressional District, recently claimed that STOCK was long overdue and that "The passage of the STOCK Act by both the House and Senate is a good first step in deterring these abusive practices, but doesn't go far enough to protect the American people from members of Congress who chose to act with self-interest over public good."<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></p><p>Other examples of positive support for STOCK include President Obama who upon signing the bill reassured that congressional members must play by the same rules as regular citizens. Obama regards the STOCK act as a way to monitor congressional activity and create transparency within the branch. He spoke to this point by adding, "It's the notion that the powerful shouldn't get to create one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else. ... If we expect that to apply to our biggest corporations and our most successful citizens, it certainly should apply to our elected officials."<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>The STOCK Act was modified on April 15, 2013, by S.716. This amendment modifies the online disclosure portion of the STOCK Act, so that some officials, but not the President, Vice President, Congress, or anyone running for Congress, can no longer file online and their records are no longer easily accessible to the public. In Section (a)2, the amendment specifically does not alter the online access for trades by the President, the Vice President, Congress, or those running for Congress.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> The reasoning for this change was to prevent criminals from gaining access to the financial data and using it against affected persons. This bill was introduced by Senator <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Reid" title="Harry Reid">Harry Reid</a> on April 11, 2013.
