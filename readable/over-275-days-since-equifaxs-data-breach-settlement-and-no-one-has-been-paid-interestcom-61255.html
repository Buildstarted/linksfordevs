Last year, credit reporting agency Equifax was rocked by a massive<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/22/what-you-need-to-know-equifax-data-breach-700-million-settlement.html"> data breach</a> affecting most (56%) Americans. The company agreed to one of the largest settlements of its kind, $700M to be disbursed, covering identity protection monitoring services and direct cash payments to help those whose data had been stolen.</p><p>Many of you probably read some of these headlines in the summer of 2019, and many more still <a href="https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/">filled out the forms</a> after promises of up to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/business/equifax-settlement-claim-verification/index.html">$125 per afflicted party</a>. There were several deadlines and additional hoops people had to jump through, but <strong>275 days later: no one has been paid yet</strong>, and it’s not clear if they ever will be. It’s been almost three times that time (<strong>800+ Days</strong>) since the breach itself actually <em>occured </em>in Q3 of 2017.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong> “275 days later: no one has been paid yet, and it’s not clear if they ever will be.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>According to Consumer Reports and the FTC, it’s likely that any cash payments will end up being far less than the maximum of $125.&nbsp;</p><p>“A large number of claims for cash instead of credit monitoring means only one thing: each person who takes the money option will wind up only getting a small amount of money. Nowhere near the $125 they could have gotten if there hadn’t been such an enormous number of claims filed.”</p><p>As governments, businesses and individuals scramble to save their economic futures in a post-Coronavirus world, $125 per credit-using American adults could go a long way towards paying for the weekly groceries or utility bills. It makes us wonder: Should Equifax pay interest on these missed payments? How might it affect their credit score?</p><p>Equifax has placed arbitrary deadlines on their claim forms that have since elapsed, but they still allow you to “<a href="https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/file-a-claim">file an extended claim</a>” on their website through 2024. That year should give you an idea of how long you’ll likely be waiting for recompense.</p><p>The total settlement was for $700M and was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-equifax-cyber-settlement-factbox/factbox-biggest-u-s-data-breach-settlements-before-equifax-idUSKCN1UH22P">by far the largest ever for a data breach</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As more network <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/09/14/dangerous-cyberattacks-on-iot-devices-up-300-in-2019-now-rampant-report-claims/#10a8b88c5892">security issues are identified</a> in personal, as well as workplace devices, prioritizing protection might seem obvious but end up being a difficult task. These issues will likely cause more breaches in the future, as well as more settlements with consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But will the American people ever be paid for their exposure and hardships that stem from these breaches? That remains to be seen, and it hasn’t happened yet.</p><p>The number of reported data breaches rose <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/data-breaches-soared-by-17-in-2019-but-theres-some-good-news-too-2020-01-29">17% to 1,473 in 2019</a> from 1,257 a year earlier, and we’re guessing 2020 will see yet another increase. The scope of these breaches also seems to be broadening recently, with <a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-emerging-threats-2019-data-breaches.html">over 4 billion records mismanaged last year</a>. It remains to be seen if exploited users will ever be compensated for their data loss, but we’ll continue to report on the situation.</p></div></section></div></div></div></article></div></section></div></div>
