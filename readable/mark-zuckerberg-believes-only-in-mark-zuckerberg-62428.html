While Twitter took a modest stand against Trump’s hyperbolic threats, Zuckerberg announced that he sees the posts as different from those that threaten violence because they were about the <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">use of “state force.</a>” Seriously.</p><p>In a leaked staff phone call on Tuesday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to angry Facebook staffers. “We basically concluded after the research and after everything I’ve read and all the different folks that I’ve talked to that the reference is clearly to aggressive policing—maybe excessive policing—but it has no history of being read as a dog whistle for vigilante supporters to take justice into their own hands,” <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/2/21278405/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-internal-employee-q-a-defend-moderate-trump-looting-shooting-post?utm_content=recode&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=vox.social&amp;utm_medium=social&quot;}" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/2/21278405/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-internal-employee-q-a-defend-moderate-trump-looting-shooting-post?utm_content=recode&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=vox.social&amp;utm_medium=social" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Zuckerberg said of Trump’s posts</a> that taunted protesters with, “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”</p><p>And after some civil rights leaders spoke with Zuckerberg on Monday they left <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/civil-rights-leaders-left-stunned-after-trying-to-explain-racism-to-mark-zuckerberg-in-facebook-meeting?via=twitter_page&quot;}" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/civil-rights-leaders-left-stunned-after-trying-to-explain-racism-to-mark-zuckerberg-in-facebook-meeting?via=twitter_page" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“disappointed and stunned,”</a> convinced that Zuckerberg does not—or refuses to—understand basic issues like voter suppression and racism.</p><div data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GenericCallout&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;GenericCallout&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><p>SUBSCRIBE</p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://subscribe.wired.com/subscribe/splits/wired/WIR_Edit_Hardcoded?source=HCL_WIR_ARTICLE_SUBSCRIBE_INSET_0">Subscribe</a> to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite <a href="https://www.wired.com/category/ideas/">Ideas</a> writers.</p></div><p>Now, as the United States faces its greatest threat since the Civil War, Zuckerberg panders to the authoritarian in the White House.</p><p>You have to ask yourself why. "It's about the money" does not quite track. He would have all that money regardless. Zuckerberg and Facebook are deeply embedded in the global economy and power structure. He does not need Trump.</p><p>Trump has no direct or immediate power to regulate Facebook or constrict its actions in the short term. Perhaps Zuckerberg is hedging, assuming that Trump and the Republicans will go easier on him if they prevail in November. Zuckerberg already has purchased the support of some <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://nypost.com/2018/11/17/schumer-got-50k-in-donations-and-a-job-for-his-daughter-from-facebook/&quot;}" href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/17/schumer-got-50k-in-donations-and-a-job-for-his-daughter-from-facebook/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">powerful Democrats</a>, so he doesn’t have to work so hard to keep them at bay.</p><p>So what does Zuckerberg really believe? What does he really want for the world?</p><p>These are questions that for years have been perplexing those of us who write about Facebook.

Being largely uneducated and inexperienced, Zuckerberg was untroubled by facts, history, or complexity. Connectivity was just good—always and completely.</p><p>Never having grown beyond the bubbles of prep school, Harvard, Silicon Valley, and Davos, Zuckerberg had no grasp of the varieties of human cruelty, I thought. Being a straight, white, American man, Zuckerberg was oblivious to the ways in which “community” could oppress as well as comfort.</p><p>And after years of rich white men throwing money at him and calling him a genius, Zuckerberg, I assumed, was just <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/19/peter-thiel-support-donald-trump-mark-zuckerberg&quot;}" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/19/peter-thiel-support-donald-trump-mark-zuckerberg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">enthralled by rich white men</a>.</p><p>Despite, as <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V8CL7RH/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V8CL7RH/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ots=1&amp;tag=w050b-20&amp;linkCode=w50&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Steven Levy describes in detail in his essential new book on Facebook</a>, relinquishing much control of day-to-day and commercial operations of Facebook to COO Sheryl Sandberg for much of the past decade, Zuckerberg still embedded his values into the company. He did so imperfectly, though. Despite his claims to support free expression, <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/18/mark-zuckerberg-free-speech-21st-century&quot;}" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/18/mark-zuckerberg-free-speech-21st-century" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Facebook has notoriously and enthusiastically executed the censorious wishes of authoritarian governments</a> around the world.</p><p>So I expected that Zuckerberg was experiencing cognitive dissonance while watching his dear company be exploited to <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">empower genocidal forces in Myanmar</a>, religious <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-12/facebook-apologizes-for-role-in-sri-lankan-violence&quot;}" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-12/facebook-apologizes-for-role-in-sri-lankan-violence" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">terrorists in Sri Lanka</a>, or <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/12/facebook-anti-vaxxer-vaccination-groups-pressure-misinformation&quot;}" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/12/facebook-anti-vaxxer-vaccination-groups-pressure-misinformation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">vaccine deniers</a> around the world.</p><p>I was wrong. I misjudged Zuckerberg. Another thing I learned from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-lost-notebook/">Levy’s book</a> is that along with an idealistic and naive account of human communication, <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mark-zuckerberg-shouted-domination-at-facebook-meetings-book-claims-clrn7jnj2&quot;}" href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mark-zuckerberg-shouted-domination-at-facebook-meetings-book-claims-clrn7jnj2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Zuckerberg seems to love power</a> more than he loves money or the potential to do good in the world.</p><p>Having studied just enough Latin in prep school to get him in trouble, Zuckerberg was known to quote Cato, shouting “Carthago delenda est” (Carthage must be destroyed) when referring to Google. Emperor Augustus was a particular inspiration, Levy reports, and Zuckerberg named his child after Augustus, the adopted son of the tyrant Julius Caesar who ruled over the greatest and most peaceful span of the Roman Empire as its first emperor.</p><p>It was not Zuckerberg suffering from cognitive dissonance. I was. As I watched him cooly face questions from congressional representatives about the <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=https%3a%2f%2fwww.wired.com%2fstory%2fwhat-did-cambridg&amp;d=4687196790655002&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;setlang=en-US&amp;w=XHERKiQqYmtTffOkvSZR4_NbpiemSX0B&quot;}" href="https://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=https%3a%2f%2fwww.wired.com%2fstory%2fwhat-did-cambridg&amp;d=4687196790655002&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;setlang=en-US&amp;w=XHERKiQqYmtTffOkvSZR4_NbpiemSX0B" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Cambridge Analytica debacle</a>, he never seemed thoughtful, just disciplined.</p><p>That Facebook could serve people well—and it does—and that it could be abused to contribute to massive harm, pain, and death, didn’t seem to generate that one troublesome phenomenon that challenges the thoughtful: Contradiction.</p><p>Zuckerberg continued and continues to believe in the positive power of Facebook, but that’s because he believes in the <em>raw</em> power of Facebook. “Domination!,” he used to yell at staff meetings, indicating that everything is a game. Games can be won. He must win. If a few million bones get broken along the way, his game plan would still serve the greatest good for the greatest number.</p><p>He believes in himself so completely, his vision of how the world works so completely, that he is immune to cognitive dissonance. He is immune to new evidence or argument. It turns out megalomaniacs don’t suffer from cognitive dissonance.</p><p>Considered this way, one might see how Zuckerberg and Trump might get along. Trump, as well, sees life as a series of competitions that he must win, even if that means he has to cheat. Not only must Trump convince himself he won (<a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-25/government-shutdown-trump-loses-on-wall-and-declares-victory&quot;}" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-25/government-shutdown-trump-loses-on-wall-and-declares-victory" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">even when he loses</a>), he must convince himself that he dominated his opponent (<a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-s-electoral-college-win-was-not-biggest-reagan-n722016&quot;}" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-s-electoral-college-win-was-not-biggest-reagan-n722016" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">even when he failed to</a>).</p><p>There are more differences between Trump and Zuckerberg than similarities, of course. Zuckerberg actually wins most of the games he plays. The younger man has legitimate intelligence and prowess, demonstrable success, and earns far more money in one year than Trump has lost in his entire life. Zuckerberg is a dominator and an idealist. He’s an idealist about himself and his vision for how the rest of us must live.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Like the <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/04/philip-johnson-nazi-architect-marc-wortman&quot;}" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/04/philip-johnson-nazi-architect-marc-wortman" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">notorious</a> architect Philip Johnson, Mark Zuckerberg is a social engineer. He knows what’s best for us. And he believes that what’s best for Facebook is best for us. In the long run, he believes,</p><p>Facebook’s domination will redeem him by making our lives better. We just have to surrender and let it all work out. Zuckerberg can entertain local magistrates like Trump because Zuckerberg remains emperor.</p><p>The only hope we have to depose this emperor is that his troops might rebel and refuse to do his bidding. That might be starting to happen.
