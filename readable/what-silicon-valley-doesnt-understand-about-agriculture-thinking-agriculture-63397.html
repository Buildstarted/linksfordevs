<p>I was browsing HackerNews recently and a (rare) agriculture news story popped up, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23208954">this one to be specific</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20899721">but there are others</a>. As these are of interest to me I clicked and read through the comments. These linked articles aren’t all that note-worthy, but they are indicative of a trend. As a casual follower of the Ag startup scene and witnessing the vertical farming fascination for the past ~10 years grow, I’ve been genuinely confused as to some of the approaches founders are taking with their startups. For the longest time, I believed the hype that vertical farming was <em>needed</em> and more importantly, coming to a city near you™. This implies and inherent inefficiency in both current food production and its distribution chains.</p>



<p>I can only conclude Silicon Valley thinks agriculture lacks innovation or is in need of ‘disruption’ and efficiency boosting and the truth couldn’t be more opposite. The truth is, modern agriculture as most people understand it <em>already have</em> the things SV-types desire and crave: massive scale, incredible automation, hyper-efficiency. Because we live in an urban based society (roughly 20% of people in America are classified into ‘rural’ aread <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-210.html">according to the census</a>), most people don’t realize just how big agriculture is. The Midwest in the United States has close to 90M acres of corn, <a href="https://observablehq.com/@kickout/untitled">85M acres of soybean</a>, and 30M acres of wheat. Brazil has as much, and usually more, soybean acreage grown every year in their breadbasket (centered in Mato Grosso, Sorriso, Brazil). Truly incomprehensible scale. All of this is accomplished outdoors using soil that already exists, using the most cheapest energy source available–the sun–to convert carbon to a human usable form. To be clear, soil is a natural resource that will become endangered if we do not mitigate the severe erosion problems that stem from single species field that are barren (re: nothing actively growing) for 30-40% of the calendar year (in North America).</p>



<p>Modern agriculture is scaled and the modern row crop farmer is equally scaled–mostly enabled by robust automation (auto-steer tractors, precision planting machines, etc.). The average farm size is increasing and has been for quite sometime. As farm size increases, the number of people <em>directly</em> involved in agriculture for their livelihood continues to be <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Todays_Reports/reports/fnlo0419.pdf">exceedingly small</a> (there are only about ~ million farms in the United States). Sophisticated and (and generally physically massive) machines–with varying degrees of automation–have continuously driven the efficiency of a single farmer higher and higher requiring less hand labor and obtaining efficiencies of scale for cost. Farmers are the original innovators and scaled agricultural production has largely enabled the population growth seen in the last ~150 years (humans domesticated crops ~10,000 BC, well before written communication). Farmers have always been smart and savvy when evaluating decisions that affect their livelihood. They can detect when a company is trying to sell them something that actually holds no value. Why? Because if a farmer is continuously spending money on things that do not return value, they can (and do) go <a href="https://www.fb.org/market-intel/farm-bankruptcies-rise-again">out of business</a> quickly. There are no VC-funded farmers, so positive cash flow isn’t merely a good thing, its the only thing. So if a company is trying to sell a product for ~$15 an acre, a wise farmer will ensure they are getting &gt;$15 on profit from said product. This is a primary reason companies like The Climate Corporation has struggled to monetize ‘farm data’. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/10/4823004/monsanto-bets-the-farm-on-big-data">Big bets largely haven’t panned out as expected</a>. SV companies often claim data is worth <em>$x</em>, but that value generally only exists in the abstract and has poor basis on the farm and the lack of adoption suggest the product isn’t working as intended or its severely mispriced from its value. Compounding that and in addition to, University extension programs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-grant_university">mostly from Land Grant Universities</a>, have traditionally filled the role of keeping farmers up-to-date on the latest methods and profitability studies (e.g. <a href="https://coolbean.info/">Cool Bean</a>) using grant money (often funded via taxes or through ‘<a href="https://ncga.com/stay-informed/media/in-the-news/article/2020/03/corn-checkoff-assisting-teachers-with-online-curriculum-">check-off</a>‘ programs). These types of programs represent an already existing framework of farmers ‘paying’ for this type of knowledge. This model has proven scalable, even more so with the internet and social media making information readily available. Note this doesn’t prevent <em>bad</em> information from being shared, but since savvy farmers will try and eventually ignore unprofitable methods, one can assume this is an efficient system.</p>



<p>So why am I not worried about vertical farming or startups that are trying to reinvent the wheel? They are busy fighting battles that simply don’t exist for their competition (outdoor/field-based agriculture). Current agriculture doesn’t need an artificial energy source and the automation that exists <em>today</em> is breathtaking. It is completely reasonable for a single human, with assistance from machines, to comfortably farm 1,000 acres or more of traditional rows crops. It generally doesn’t matter if a vertical farm can ‘produce’ 365 days a year, the existing agriculture infrastructure in the breadbaskets of the world (United States, Brazil/Argentina/Eastern Europe) make any indoor advantage disappear, and quickly. These centers are ‘connected’ as well, with existing GPS and cellular networks available today. </p>



<p>The free advice I would give anyone looking to enter the ag startup scene: take advantage of the existing pros (scale, automation, mechanization). Startups that try to hitch along to already existing scale rather than trying to re-invent it present a much better opportunity for success.</p>
