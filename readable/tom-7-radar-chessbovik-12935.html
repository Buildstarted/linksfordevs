<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td> Well, here we are on the eve of <a href="http://sigbovik.org/2019/">SIGBOVIK 2019</a>. I'm in the midst of a long day of video-making for one of my projects, but I can get 2 for the price of 5 by posting now about four of my papers. This year I've been on a chess kick, which I think I've successfully gotten out of my system by writing all these (previous posts alluded to there being five, but one of them didn't really go anywhere and/or just became part of the other(s)). They are sort of intertwined:<p> <b><a href="http://tom7.org/chess/survival.pdf">Survival in chessland</a></b> is about how to stay alive if you are <i>being a chesspiece to the death</i></p><p> <b><a href="http://tom7.org/chess/blind.pdf">Color- and piece-blind  chess</a></b> is about, among other things, playing chess without being able to tell what the pieces are (only <i>where</i> they are)</p><p> <b><a href="http://tom7.org/chess/weak.pdf">Elo World, a framework for benchmarking weak chess engines</a></b> is about exploring the full spectrum of computer chess play</p><p> <b><a href="http://tom7.org/chess/cve.pdf">CVE-2018-90017117 #KingMe</a></b> is just a short joke, but based on a true story</p><p> My last paper is on a different (maybe <i>even weirder</i>?) topic, and I'm putting together a video for it now, so I should be uploading that tomorrow some time. It's been a bit rough going, though, since I replaced my computer a few months ago and forgot that I hadn't actually set stuff up for this kind of work; I'm experiencing small problems like custom key commands aren't set, and bigger problems like audio drivers acting crazy. Looks like I will be able to finish with some vacation time, at least.</p><p> Speaking of vacation, this month we also went to Belize, which was pretty cool. The highlight for me was swimming/scrambling 1km into a cave ("Actun Tunichil Muknal") to access an approximately 1000 year-old Mayan site where they performed human sacrifices; it's remarkable because almost all of the artifacts are still in situ, including a number of calcified human skeletons. Was pretty wild. I got some good running done, found some New Haven-style pizza (!?), and wrote papers about chess (?!).</p></td></div></div></div>
