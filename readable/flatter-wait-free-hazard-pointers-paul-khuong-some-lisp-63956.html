        <hr/>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in February 2020, Blelloch and Wei submitted this cool preprint: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07053">Concurrent Reference Counting and Resource Management in Wait-free Constant Time</a>.
Their work mostly caught my attention because they propose a wait-free implementation of hazard pointers for safe memory reclamation.<sup id="fnref:but-also"><a href="#fn:but-also">1</a></sup>
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tomhart/papers/tomhart_thesis.pdf">Safe memory reclamation (PDF)</a> is a key component in lock-free algorithms when garbage collection isn’t an option,<sup id="fnref:it-is-gc"><a href="#fn:it-is-gc">2</a></sup>
and <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.395.378&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">hazard pointers (PDF)</a> let us bound resource leaks much more tightly than, e.g., <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-579.pdf">epoch reclamation (PDF)</a>.
However the usual implementation has a <em>loop</em> in its <a href="https://www.iecc.com/gclist/GC-algorithms.html">read barriers (in the garbage collection sense)</a>,
which can be annoying for code generation and bad for worst-case time bounds.</p>
<p>Blelloch and Wei’s wait-free algorithm eliminates that loop… with a construction that stacks <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09671">two emulated primitives—atomic copy, itself implemented with strong LL/SC—</a>on top of what real hardware offers.
I see the real value of the construction in proving that wait-freedom is achievable,
and that the key is atomic memory-memory copies.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll show how to flatten down that abstraction tower into something practical with a bit of engineering elbow grease,
and come up with wait-free alternatives to the usual lock-free hazard pointers
that are competitive in the best case.
Blelloch and Wei’s insight that hazard pointers can use any wait-free atomic memory-memory copy lets us improve the worst case
without impacting the common case!</p>
<p>But first, what are hazard pointers?</p>
<h2 id="hazard-pointers-and-the-safe-memory-reclamation-problem">Hazard pointers and the safe memory reclamation problem</h2>
<p>Hazard pointers were introduced by <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/m/Michael:Maged_M=.html">Maged Michael</a>
in <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.395.378&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Hazard Pointers: Safe Memory Reclamation for Lock-Free Objects (2005, PDF)</a>,
as the first solution to reclamation races in lock-free code.
The introduction includes a concise explanation of the safe memory reclamation (SMR) problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a thread removes a node, it is possible that some other contending thread—in the course of its lock-free operation—has earlier read a reference to that node, and is about to access its contents. If the removing thread were to reclaim the removed node for arbitrary reuse, the contending thread might corrupt the object or some other object that happens to occupy the space of the freed node, return the wrong result, or suffer an access error by dereferencing an invalid pointer value. […] Simply put, the memory reclamation problem is how to allow the memory of removed nodes to be freed (i.e., reused arbitrarily or returned to the OS), while guaranteeing that no thread accesses free memory, and how to do so in a lock-free manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, a solution to the SMR problem lets us know when it’s safe to
<em>physically release</em> resources that used to be owned by a linked data structure,
once all links to these resources have been removed from that data structure (after “logical deletion”).
The problem makes intuitive sense for dynamically managed memory,
but it applies equally well to any resource (e.g., file descriptors),
and its solutions can even be seen as extremely read-optimised reader/writer locks.</p>
<p>The basic idea behind Hazard Pointers is to have
each thread publish to permanently allocated<sup id="fnref:stable-alloc"><a href="#fn:stable-alloc">3</a></sup> hazard pointer records (HP records) the set of resources (pointers) it’s temporarily borrowing from a lock-free data structure.
That’s enough information for a background thread to snapshot the current limbo list of resources that have been logically deleted but not yet physically released,
scan all records for all threads,
and physically release all resources in the snapshot that aren’t in any hazard pointer record.</p>
<p>With just enough batching of the limbo list, this scheme can be practical:
in practice, lock-free algorithms only need to pin a few (usually one or two) nodes at a time to ensure memory safety. As long as we avoid running arbitrary code while holding hazardous references, we can bound the number of records each thread may need at any one time.
Scanning the records thus takes time roughly linear in the number of active threads, and we can amortise that to constant time per deleted item by waiting until the size of the limbo list is greater than a multiple of the number of active threads.<sup id="fnref:even-with-pinned-nodes"><a href="#fn:even-with-pinned-nodes">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The tricky bit is figuring out how to reliably publish to a HP record without locking.
Hazard pointers simplify that challenge with three observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s OK to have arbitrary garbage in a record (let’s disregard language-level<sup id="fnref:or-hw-level"><a href="#fn:or-hw-level">5</a></sup> undefined behaviour), since protected values are only ever subtracted from the limbo list: a garbage record simply doesn’t protect anything.</li>
<li>It’s also OK to leave a false positive in a record: our leakage bounds assume each record keeps a different node (resource) alive, and that’s the worst case.</li>
<li>1 and 2 mean it doesn’t matter what pinned value we read in a record whose last update was started after we snapshotted the limbo list: resources in the limbo list are unreachable, so freshly pinned resources can’t refer to anything in the snapshot.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where the clever bit of hazard pointers comes in:
we must make sure that any resource (pointer to a node, etc.) we borrow from a lock-free data structure is immediately protected by a HP record.
We can’t make two things happen atomically without locking.
Instead, we’ll <em>guess</em> what resource we will borrow,
publish that guess,
and then actually borrow the resource.
If we guessed correctly, we can immediately use the borrowed resource;
if we were wrong, we must try again.</p>
<p>On an ideal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_consistency">sequentially consistent</a> machine,
the pseudocode looks like the following.</p>

<p>We need a store/load fence in <code>R1</code> to make sure the store to the record (just above <code>R1</code>) is visible by the time the second read (<code>R2</code>) executes. Under the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/weakmemory/x86tso-paper.tphols.pdf">TSO memory model implemented by x86 chips (PDF)</a>,
this fence is the only one that isn’t implicitly satisfied by the hardware.
It also happens that fences are best implemented with atomic operations
on x86oids,
so we can eliminate the fence in <code>R1</code>
by replacing the store just before <code>R1</code> with an atomic exchange (fetch-and-set).</p>
<p>The slow cleanup path has its own fence that matches <code>R1</code> (the one in <code>R2</code>
matches the mutators’ writes to <code>cell</code>).</p>

<p>We must make sure all the values in the limbo list we grab in <code>C1</code>
were added to the list (and thus logically deleted) before we read any
of the records in <code>C2</code>, with the acquire read in <code>C1</code>
matching the store-load fence in <code>R1</code>.</p>
<p>The following sequence diagrams shows how the fencing guarantees that any
iteration of <code>hp_read_explicit</code> will fail if it starts before <code>C1</code>
and observes a stale value.
If the read succeeds, the ordering between <code>R1</code> and <code>C1</code> instead
guarantees that the cleanup loop will observed the pinned value
when it reads the record in <code>C2</code>.</p>

<p>This all works, but it’s slow:<sup id="fnref:travis-says-its-fine"><a href="#fn:travis-says-its-fine">7</a></sup> we added an <em>atomic</em> write instruction (or worse, a fence) to a read-only operation. We can do better with a little help from our operating system.</p>
<h2 id="injecting-fences-with-os-support">Injecting fences with OS support</h2>
<p>When we use fences or memory ordering correctly, there should be
an implicit pairing between fences or ordered operations: we use fencing to
enforce an ordering (one must fully execute before or after another,
overlap is forbidden) between pairs of instructions in different
threads. For example, the pseudocode for hazard pointers with
explicit fencing and memory ordering paired the store-load fence in
<code>R1</code> with the acquisition of the limbo list in <code>C1</code>.</p>
<p>We only need that pairing very rarely, when a thread actually executes the
cleanup function. The amortisation strategy guarantees we don’t scan records all the time, and we can always increase the amortisation factor if we’re
generating tiny amounts of garbage very quickly.</p>
<p>It kind of sucks that we have to incur a full fence on the fast read
path, when it only matches reads in the cleanup loop maybe as rarely
as, e.g., once a second. If we waited long enough on the slow path, we could
<a href="https://pvk.ca/Blog/2019/01/09/preemption-is-gc-for-memory-reordering">rely on events like preemption or other interrupts to insert a barrier</a>
in all threads that are executing the read-side.</p>
<p>How long is “enough?”
Linux has the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/membarrier.2.html"><code>membarrier</code> syscall</a>
to block the calling thread until (more than) long enough has elapsed,
Window has <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushprocesswritebuffers">the similar <code>FlushProcessWriteBuffers</code></a>, and
on other operating systems, we can probably <a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/barrierd">do something useful with scheduler statistics</a> or ask for a new syscall.</p>
<p>Armed with these new blocking system calls, we can replace the store-load fence in <code>R1</code> with a compiler barrier, and execute a slow <code>membarrier</code>/<code>FlushProcessWriteBuffers</code> after <code>C1</code>.
The cleanup function will then wait long enough to ensure that any
read-side operation that had executed before <code>R1</code> at the time we read the limbo list in <code>C1</code> will be visible (e.g., because the operating system knows a preemption interrupt executed at least once on each core).
The pseudocode for this asymmetric strategy follows.</p>

<p>We’ve replaced a fence on the fast read path with a compiler barrier, at the expense of executing a heavy syscall on the slow path. That’s usually an advantageous trade-off, and is the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/synchronization/Hazptr.h">preferred implementation strategy for Folly’s hazard pointers</a>.</p>
<p>The ability to pair mere <em>compiler</em> barriers with <code>membarrier</code>
syscalls opens the door for many more “atomic enough” operations, not
just the fenced stores and loads we used until now:
similarly to the key idea in <a href="https://github.com/concurrencykit/ck/blob/master/include/ck_ec.h">Concurrency Kit’s atomic-free SPMC event count</a>,
we can use non-interlocked read-modify-write instructions,
since any interrupt (please don’t mention imprecise interrupts) will happen before or after any such instruction,
and never in the middle of an instruction.</p>
<h2 id="wait-free-hazard-pointers-with-interrupt-atomic-instructions">Wait-free hazard pointers with interrupt-atomic instructions</h2>
<p>The key insight that lets <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07053">Blelloch and Wei</a>
achieve wait-freedom in hazard pointer is that the combination
of publishing a guess and confirming that the guess is correct in <code>hp_read</code>
emulates an atomic memory-memory copy. Given such an atomic copy primitive, the read-side becomes trivial.</p>

<p>The “only” problem is that atomic copies don’t exist in contemporary hardware.</p>
<p>However, we’ve already noted that syscalls like <code>membarrier</code> mean we can weaken our requirements to interrupt atomicity. In other words, individual non-atomic instructions work since we’re assuming precise interrupts… and <code>x86</code> and <code>amd64</code> do have an instruction for memory-memory copies!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/movs:movsb:movsw:movsd:movsq"><code>MOVS</code> instructions</a> are typically only used with a <code>REP</code> prefix. However, they can also be executed without any prefix, to execute one iteration of the copy loop. Executing a <code>REP</code>-free <code>MOVSQ</code> instruction copies one quadword (64 bits) from <code>[RSI]</code> to <code>[RDI]</code>, and increment both registers… and all this stuff happens in one instructions, so will never be split by an interrupt.
That’s an <em>interrupt</em>-atomic copy, which we can slot in place
of the software atomic copy in Blelloch and Wei’s proposal!</p>

<p>Again, the <code>MOVS</code> instruction is not atomic, but will be ordered with
respect to the <code>membarrier</code> syscall in <code>hp_cleanup_membarrier</code>: either
the copy fully executes before the <code>membarrier</code> in <code>C1</code>, in which case the
pinned value will be visible to the cleanup loop, or it executes after
the <code>membarrier</code>, which guarantees the copy will not observe a stale value
that’s waiting in the limbo list.</p>
<p>That’s just one instruction, but instructions aren’t all created
equal. <a href="https://uops.info/html-instr/MOVSQ.html"><code>MOVS</code> is on the heavy side</a>: in order to read from memory, write to memory, and increment two registers,
a modern Intel chip has to execute 5 micro-ops in at least ~5 cycles.
That’s not exactly fast; definitely better than an atomic (<code>LOCK</code>ed)
instruction, but not fast.</p>
<p>We can improve that with a trick from side-channel attacks, and
preserve wait-freedom. We can usually guess what value we’ll find in
<code>record.pin</code>, simply by reading <code>cell</code> with a regular relaxed load.
Unless we’re extremely unlucky (realistically, as long as the reader
thread isn’t interrupted), <code>MOVSQ</code> will copy the same value we just
guessed. That’s enough to exploit branch prediction and turn a data
dependency on <code>MOVSQ</code> (a high latency instruction) into a data
dependency on a regular load <code>MOV</code> (low latency), and a highly
predictable control dependency. In very low level pseudo code, this
“speculative” version of the <code>MOVS</code> read-side might look like:</p>

<p>We’ll see that, in reasonable circumstances, this wait-free
code sequence is faster than the usual membarrier-based lock-free
read side. But first, let’s see how we can achieve wait-freedom
without CISCy instructions, with an asymmetric “helping” scheme.</p>
<h2 id="interrupt-atomic-copy-with-some-help">Interrupt-atomic copy, with some help</h2>
<p>Blelloch and Wei’s wait-free atomic copy primitive builds on the
usual trick for wait-free algorithms: when a thread would wait for an
in-progress operations, it helps that operation complete
instead of blocking.</p>
<p>This strategy has the marked advantage of working. However, it’s
also symmetric between the common case (the thread that initiated
the operation quickly completes it), and the worst case (another
thread notices the initiating thread got stuck and moves the
operation along). We pessimised the common case in order to eliminate blocking in the worst case, a frequent and unfortunate pattern in wait-free algorithms.</p>
<p>The source of the symmetry is our specification of an atomic copy
from one source field to one destination field, which must
be written exactly once by the thread that initiated the copy
(the hazard pointer reader), or any concurrent helper (the cleanup loop).</p>
<p>We can relax that requirement, since we know that the hazard pointer
scanning loop can handle spurious or garbage pinned values. Rather
than forcing both the fast path and the slow path to write to the same
<code>pin</code> field, we will give each HP record <em>two</em> pin fields: a
single-writer one for the fast path, and a multi-writer one for all
helpers.</p>
<p>Until now a hazard pointer record has only had one field, the “pinned”
value. We must add some complexity to make this asymmetric helping
scheme work: in order for helpers to be able to help, we must publish
the cell we are reading, and we need somewhere for helpers to write
the pinned value they read. We also need some sort of ABA protection
to make sure slow helpers don’t overwrite a fresher pinned value
with a stale one, when the <em>helper</em> gets stuck (preempted).</p>
<p>Concretely, the HP record still has a <code>pin</code> field, which is only
written by the reader that owns the record, and read by cleanup
threads. The <code>help</code> subrecord is written by both the owner of the
record and any cleanup thread that might want to move a reader along. The
reader will first write the address of the pointer it wants to read
and protect in <code>cell</code>, generate a new unique generation id by incrementing
<code>gen_sequence</code>, and write that to <code>pin_or_gen</code>. We’ll tag
generation ids with their sign: negative
values are generation ids, positive ones are addresses.</p>

<p>At this point, any cleanup thread should be able to notice that the
<code>help.pin_or_gen</code> is a generation value, and find a valid cell address
in <code>help.cell</code>. That’s enough to read the cell’s value, and publish to
the address it just read with an atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) of
<code>pin_or_gen</code>: if the CAS fails, another helper got there first, or
the reader has already moved on to a new target cell. In the latter
case, any in-flight hazard pointer read sequence started before we
started reclaiming the limbo list, and it doesn’t matter what pinned
value we extract from the record.</p>
<p>Having populated the <code>help</code> subrecord, a reader can now publish a
value in <code>pin</code>, and then look for a pinned value in
<code>help.pin_or_gen</code>: if a helper published a pinned value there, the
reader must use it, and not the potentially stale (already destroyed)
value the reader wrote to <code>pin</code>.</p>
<p>On the read side, we can rely on two compiler barriers to let
membarriers guarantee writes to the <code>help</code> subrecord are visible
before we start reading from the target cell, and to guarantee
that any helper’s write to <code>record.help.pin_or_gen</code> is visible
before we compare <code>record.help.pin_or_gen</code> against <code>gen</code>:</p>

<p>The membarrier in <code>C1</code> matches the compiler barrier in <code>RA</code>: if a
read-side section executed <code>R2</code> before we consumed the limbo list, its
writes to <code>record.help</code> must be visible. The second membarrier in
<code>C2</code> matches the compiler barrier in <code>RB</code>: if the read-side section
has written to <code>record.pin</code>, that write must be visible, otherwise,
the helper’s write to <code>help.pin_or_gen</code> must be visible to the reader.
Finally, when scanning for pinned values, we can’t determine whether
the reader used its own value or the one we published, so we must
conservatively add both to the pinned set.</p>
<p>That’s a couple more instructions on the read-side than the
speculative <code>MOVSQ</code> implementation. However, the instructions are
simpler, and the portable wait-free implementation benefits even more
from speculative execution: the final branch is equally predictable,
and now depends only on a read of <code>record.help.pin_or_gen</code>, which can
be satisfied by forwarding the reader’s own write to that same field.</p>
<p>The end result is that, in my microbenchmarks, this portable wait-free
implementation does slightly <em>better</em> than the speculative <code>MOVSQ</code> code.
We make this even tighter, by further specialising the code. The cleanup
path is already slow. What if we also assumed mutual exclusion; what if,
for each record, only one cleanup at a time could be in flight?</p>
<h2 id="interrupt-atomic-copy-with-at-most-one-helper">Interrupt-atomic copy, with at most one helper</h2>
<p>Once we may assume mutual exclusion between cleanup loops, we don’t
have to worry about ABA protection anymore. Hazard pointer records
can lose some weight.</p>

<p>Again, <code>RA</code> matches <code>C1</code>, and <code>RB</code> <code>C2</code>. This new implementation is simpler than <code>hp_read_wf</code> on the read side, and needs even fewer instructions.</p>
<h2 id="qualitative-differences-between-hp-implementations">Qualitative differences between HP implementations</h2>
<p>A key attribute for hazard pointers is how much they slow down pointer
traversal in the common case. However, there are other qualitative
factors that should impact our choice of implementation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/concurrencykit/ck/blob/master/include/ck_hp.h">classic fenced (<code>hp_read_explicit</code>) implementation</a>
needs one atomic or fence instruction per read, but does not require any
exotic OS operation.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/synchronization/Hazptr.h">simple membarrier implementation (<code>hp_read_membarrier</code>)</a>
is ABI-compatible with the fenced implementations, but lets the read side
replace the fence with a compiler barrier, as long as the
slow cleanup path can issue <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/membarrier.2.html"><code>membarrier</code> syscalls</a>
on Linux, or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushprocesswritebuffers">the similar <code>FlushProcessWriteBuffers</code></a>
on Windows. All the remaining implementations (we won’t mention the much more complex wait-free implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07053">Blelloch and Wei</a>)
also rely on the same syscalls to avoid fences or atomic instructions
on the read side, while additionally providing wait-freedom (constant
execution time) for readers, rather than mere lock-freedom.</p>
<p>The simple <code>MOVSQ</code>-based implementations (<code>hp_read_movs</code>) is fully
compatible with <code>hp_read_membarrier</code>, wait-free, and usually compiles
down to fewer instruction bytes, but is slightly slower. Adding
speculation (<code>hp_read_movs_spec</code>) retains compatibility and closes the
performance gap, with a number of instruction bytes comparable to the
lock-free membarrier implementation. In both cases, we rely on
<code>MOVSQ</code>, an instruction that only exists on <code>x86</code> and <code>amd64</code>.</p>
<p>However, we can also provide portable wait-freedom, once we modify the
cleanup code to help the read side sections forward. The basic
implementation <code>hp_read_wf</code> compiles to many more instructions than
the other read-side implementations, but those instructions are mostly
upstream of the protected pointer read; in microbenchmarks, the result
can even be faster than the simple <code>hp_read_membarrier</code> or the
speculative <code>hp_read_movs_spec</code>. The downside is that instruction
bytes tend to hurt much more in real code than in microbenchmarks.
We also rely on pointer tagging, which could make the code less widely applicable.</p>
<p>We can simplify and shrink the portable wait-free code by assuming
mutual exclusion on the cleanup path (<code>hp_read_swf</code>). Performance is
improved or roughly the same, and instruction bytes comparable to
<code>hp_read_membarrier</code>. However, we’ve introduced more opportunities
for reclamation hiccups.</p>
<p>More importantly, achieving wait-freedom with concurrent help suffers
from a fundamental issue: helpers don’t know that the pointer read they’re
helping move forward is stale until they (fail to) CAS into
place the value they just read. This means they must be able to safely read potentially stale
pointers without crashing. One might think mutual exclusion in the
cleanup function fixes that, but programs often mix and match
different reclamation schemes, as well as lock-free and lock-ful code.
On Linux, we could
abuse <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/process_vm_readv.2.html">the <code>process_vm_readv</code> syscall</a>;
in general I suppose we could install signal handlers to catch <code>SIGSEGV</code> and <code>SIGBUS</code>.</p>
<p>Having to help readers forward also loses a nice practical property of
hazard pointers: it’s always safe to spuriously consider arbitrary
(readable) memory as a hazard pointer record, it only costs us
additional conservatism in reclamation. That’s not the case anymore,
once the cleanup thread has to help readers, and thus must write to HP
records. This downside does not impact plain implementations of
hazard pointers, but does make it harder to improve record management
overhead by taking inspiration from managed language runtimes.</p>
<h2 id="some-microbenchmarks">Some microbenchmarks</h2>
<p>The overhead of hazard pointers only matters in code that traverse a
lot of pointers, especially pointer chains. That’s why I’ll focus on
microbenchmarking a loop that traverses a pseudo-randomly shuffled
circular linked list (embedded in an array of 1024 nodes, at 16
bytes per node) for a fixed number of pointer chasing hops. You can
find the <a href="https://gist.github.com/pkhuong/5f3acc53b4f046f2717e645ecd504f7b">code to replicate the results in this gist</a>.</p>
<p>The unprotected (baseline) inner loop follows. Note the <code>NULL</code>
end-of-list check, for realism; the list is circular, so the loop
never breaks early.</p>

<p>There’s clearly a dependency chain between each read of <code>head-&gt;next</code>.
The call to <code>frob_ptr</code> lets us introduce work in the dependency chain,
which more closely represents realistic use cases. For example, when
using hazard pointers to protect a binary search tree traversal, we
must perform a small amount of work to determine whether we want to go
down the left or the right subtree.</p>
<p>A hazard pointer-ed implementation of this loop would probably unroll
the loop body twice, to more easily implement hand-over-hand locking.
That’s why I also include an unrolled version of this inner loop in
the microbenchmark: we avoid discovering that hazard pointer
protection improves performance because it’s also associated with
unrolling, and gives us an idea of how much variation we can expect from
small code generation changes.</p>

<p>The dependency chain is pretty obvious; we can measure the sum of
latencies for 1000 pointer dereferences by running the loop 1000
times. I’m using a large iteration count to absorb noise from the
timing harness (roughly 50 cycles per call), as well as any boundary
effect around the first and last few loop iterations.</p>
<p>All the cycle measurements here are from my unloaded E5-4617, running
at 2.9 GHz without Turbo Boost. First, let’s see what happens with a
pure traversal, where <code>frob_ptr</code> is an inline no-op function
that simply return its first argument. This microbenchmark is far
from realistic (if I found an inner loop that <em>only</em> traversed a
singly linked list, I’d consider a different data structure), but helps
establish an upper bound on the overhead from different hazard pointer
read sides. I would usually show a faceted graph of the latency
distribution for the various methods… but the results are so stable<sup id="fnref:did-not-randomize-codegen"><a href="#fn:did-not-randomize-codegen">8</a></sup>
that I doubt there’s any additional information to be found in the graphs,
compared to the tables below.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The table above reports quantiles for the total runtime of 1000
pointer dereferences, after one million repetitions.</p>
<p>We’re looking at a baseline of 4 cycles/pointer dereference (the L1 cache
latency), regardless of unrolling. The only implementation with an
actual fence or atomic operation, <code>hp_read_explicit</code> fares pretty
badly, at more than 5x the latency. Replacing that fence with a
compiler barrier in <code>hp_read_membarrier</code> reduces the overhead to ~1
cycle per pointer dereference. Our first wait-free implementation,
<code>hp_read_movs</code> (based on a raw <code>MOVSQ</code>) doesn’t do too great, with a
~6 cycle (150%) overhead for each pointer dereference. However,
speculation (<code>hp_read_movs_spec</code>) does help shave that to ~4.5 cycles
(110%). The portable wait-free implementation <code>hp_read_wf</code> does
slightly better, and its single-cleanup version <code>hp_read_swf</code> takes
the crown, by adding around 0.2 cycle/dereference.</p>
<p>These results are stable and repeatable, but still fragile, in a way:
except for <code>hp_read_explicit</code>, which is massively slowed down by its
atomic operation, and for <code>hp_read_movs</code>, which adds a known latency bump on the hot path, the other slowdowns mostly reflect contention for
execution resources. In real life, such contention usually only occurs in
heavily tuned code, and the actual execution units (ports) in high
demand will vary from one inner loop to another.</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens when we insert a ~4-cycle latency slowdown
(three for the multiplication, and one more for the increment) in the
hot path, by redefining <code>frob_ptr</code>. The result of the integer
multiplication by 0 is always 0, but adds a (non speculated) data
dependency on the node value and on the multiplication to the pointer
chasing dependency chain. Only four cycles of work to decide which
pointer to traverse is on the low end of my practical experience, but
suffices to equalise away most of the difference between the hazard
pointer implementations.</p>

<p>Let’s again look at the quantiles for the cycle count for one million
loops of 1000 pointer dereferences, on an unloaded E5-4617 @ 2.9 GHz.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The difference between <code>unrolled</code> in this table and in the previous
one shows we actually added around 5 cycles of latency per iteration
with the multiplication in <code>frob_ptr</code>. That dominates the overhead we
estimated earlier for all the hazard pointer schemes except for the
remarkably slow <code>hp_read_explicit</code> and <code>hp_read_movs</code>. It’s thus not
surprising that all hazard pointer implementations but the latter
two are on par with the unprotected traversal loops (within 1.1 cycle
per pointer dereference, less than the impact of unrolling the loop
without unlocking any further rewrite).</p>
<p>The relative speed of the methods has changed, compared
to the previous table. The speculative wait-free implementation
<code>hp_read_movs_spec</code> was slower than <code>hp_read_membarrier</code> and much
slower than <code>hp_read_swf</code>; it’s now slightly faster than both.
The simple portable wait-free implementation <code>hp_read_wf</code> was slower than
<code>hp_read_membarrier</code> and <code>hp_read_swf</code>; it’s now the fastest implementation.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t read too much into the relative rankings of
<code>hp_read_membarrier</code>, <code>hp_read_movs_spec</code>, <code>hp_read_wf</code>, and
<code>hp_read_swf</code>. They only differ by fractions of a cycle per
dereference (all between 9.5 and 10.1 cycle/deref), and the exact values are a function of the
specific mix of micro-ops in the inner loop, and of the
near-unpredictable impact of instruction ordering on the chip’s
scheduling logic. What really matters is that their impact
on traversal latency is negligible once the pointer chasing loop does <em>some</em>
work to find the next node.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-best-hazard-pointer-implementation">What’s the best hazard pointer implementation?</h2>
<p>I hope I’ve made a convincing case that hazard pointers can be
<em>wait-free and efficient</em> on the read-side, as long as we have access
to something like <code>membarrier</code> or <code>FlushProcessWriteBuffers</code> on the
slow cleanup (reclamation) path. If one were to look at the
microbenchmarks alone, one would probably pick <code>hp_read_swf</code>.</p>
<p>However, the real world is more complex that microbenchmarks. When I
have to extrapolate from microbenchmarks, I usually worry about the
hidden impact of instruction bytes or cold branches, since
microbenchmarks tend to fail at surfacing these things. I’m not as
worried for <code>hp_read_movs_spec</code>, and <code>hp_read_swf</code>: they both compile
down to roughly as many instructions as the incumbent, <code>hp_read_membarrier</code>,
and their forward untaken branch would be handled fine by a static predictor.</p>
<p>What I would take into account is the ability to transparently use
<code>hp_read_movs_spec</code> in code that already uses <code>hp_read_membarrier</code>,
and the added requirements of <code>hp_read_swf</code>. In
addition to relying on <code>membarrier</code> for correctness, <code>hp_read_swf</code>
needs a pointer tagging scheme to distinguish target pointers from pinned ones, a way for cleanup threads to read stale pointers without
crashing, and also imposes mutual exclusion around the scanning of (sets
of) hazard pointer records. These additional requirements don’t seem
impractical, but I can imagine code bases where they would constitute
hard blockers (e.g., library code, or when protecting arbitrary integers).</p>
<p>TL;DR: Use <a href="#hp_read_swf"><code>hp_read_swf</code> if you know what you’re doing</a> or want more wait-free speed holes. Otherwise, <a href="#hp_read_movs_spec"><code>hp_read_movs_spec</code> is an all-around solid option on <code>x86</code> and <code>amd64</code></a>, and still wait-free.</p>
<p>P.S., <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/">Travis Downs</a> notes that mem-mem <code>PUSH</code> might be an alternative to <code>MOVSQ</code>, but that requires either pointing <code>RSP</code> to arbitrary memory, or allocating hazard pointers on the stack (which isn’t necessarily a bad idea). Another idea worthy of investigation!</p>
