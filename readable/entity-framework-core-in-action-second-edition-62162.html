                                    Entity Framework Core is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that bridges the gap between your C# code and the commands required to access relational databases. As Microsoft’s recommended data access technology, it automatically maps your classes and code to the tables and views of a database—making it radically easier to query and write to databases from a .NET application. It allows you to query and write to your database using standard LINQ commands, and it will even automatically generate the model from your database schema. Now that .NET Core 5 is Microsoft’s primary development system, it’s never been more important to master Entity Framework Core.
