<h3>Hardware Accelerated Models and FPGA on Data Box Edge</h3>

<p>In addition to acceleration available with GPUs, now scale from cloud to edge with Azure Machine Learning Hardware Accelerated Models, powered by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-accelerate-with-fpgas" target="_blank">FPGAs</a>. These Hardware Accelerated Models are now generally available in the cloud, along with a preview of models deployed to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databox-online/data-box-edge-overview" target="_blank">Data Box Edge</a>.</p>

<p>FPGA technology supports compute intensive scenarios like deep neural networks (DNNs), that have ushered in breakthroughs in computer vision, without forcing tradeoffs between price and performance. With FPGA’s it is possible to achieve ultra-low latency with ResNet 50, ResNet 152, VGG-16, DenseNet 121, and SSD-VGG. FPGAs enable real-time insights for scenarios like manufacturing defect analysis, satellite imagery, or autonomous video footage to drive business critical decisions.</p>

<h3>Model interpretability</h3>

<p>Microsoft is committed to supporting transparency, intelligibility, and explanation in machine learning models. Model interpretability brings us one step closer to understanding the predictions a model makes to ensure fairness and avoid model bias. This deeper understanding of models is key when uncovering insights about the model itself both in order to improve model accuracy during training and to uncover model behaviors and explain model prediction outcomes during inferencing.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/machine-learning-interpretability-explainability" target="_blank">Model interpretability</a> is available in preview and cutting-edge open source technologies (e.g., SHAP, LIME) under a common API, giving data scientists the tools to explain machine learning models globally on all data, or locally on a specific data point in an easy-to-use and scalable fashion.</p>

<h2>Open and interoperable platform providing flexibility and choice&nbsp;</h2>

<p><em>“All the data scientists on our team enjoy using Azure Machine Learning, because it’s fully interoperable with all the other tools they use in their day-to-day work—no extra training is needed, and they get more done faster now.”</em></p>

<p>— Matthieu Boujonnier, Analytics Application Architect and Data Scientist, Schneider Electric</p>

<h3>ONNX Runtime with Azure Machine Learning</h3>

<p>Azure Machine Learning service supports <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-onnx" target="_blank">ONNX</a> (Open Neural Network Exchange), the open standard for representing machine learning models from TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, SciKit-Learn, and many other frameworks. An updated version of ONNX Runtime is now available fully supporting ONNX 1.5 (including object detection models such as YOLOv3 and SSD). With <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/onnx-runtime-for-inferencing-machine-learning-models-now-in-preview/" target="_blank">ONNX Runtime</a>, developers now have a consistent scoring API that enables hardware acceleration thanks to the general availability of NVIDIA TensorRT integration and the public preview of Intel nGraph integration. ONNX Runtime is used on millions of Windows devices as part of Windows ML. ONNX Runtime also handles billions of requests in hyperscale Microsoft services such as Office, Bing, and Cognitive Services where an average of two times the performance gains have been seen.</p>
