<p>Last week, I had a creepy feeling &#x2014; one familiar to almost anyone on the internet. My personal information had been exposed online, again.</p><p>My name, email address and information about my work history had turned up in an online database for anyone to find &#x2014; my details along with those of <a class="external" href="https://www.dataviper.io/blog/2019/pdl-data-exposure-billion-people/">millions of other people</a>.</p><p>I received a notification about the incident from <a class="external" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned?</a>, an online service that lets me know when my email address is part of a data breach. </p><p>It&apos;s far from the first time: There was the <a class="external" href="https://staff.tumblr.com/post/144263069415/we-recently-learned-that-a-third-party-had">Tumblr breach of 2013</a>. The <a class="external" href="https://support.canva.com/contact/customer-support/may-24-security-incident-faqs/">Canva breach of 2019</a>. And those were companies I&apos;d willingly shared my details with.</p><p>This time, the alert suggested my data had been lost by an industry I&apos;d never heard of &#x2014; the booming business of &quot;data enrichment&quot;. </p><h2>How to find a data breach</h2><p>When cyber security researcher Bob Diachenko found the database he was immediately struck by its scale.</p><p>It didn&apos;t have passwords or credit card details, but it was still a &quot;dangerous&quot; trove that could have serious impact in the wrong hands &#x2014; for targeting people with phishing attacks, for example, based on their background and profile.</p><p>He and fellow researcher Vinny Troia attempted to find the data&apos;s owner, but with no luck.</p><p>They did determine, however, that some of the data <a class="external" href="https://www.dataviper.io/blog/2019/pdl-data-exposure-billion-people/">appears to have originated </a>with data brokers called Oxydata and People Data Labs (PDL), which offer &quot;data enrichment&quot; services.</p><p>PDL&apos;s cofounder Sean Thorne <a class="external" href="https://www.wired.com/story/billion-records-exposed-online/">told Wired</a> his company doesn&apos;t own the server in question, but a third party could have taken their data and left it exposed.</p><p>An Oxydata spokesperson also told me that while clients are &quot;contractually obligated&quot; to protect what they&apos;ve purchased, there is little the company can do when it&apos;s out of their hands. </p><p>No matter who was responsible, Mr Diachenko suggested the main question remained: &quot;How did they get my data?&quot; </p><h2>The world of data enrichment</h2><p>Data enrichment services take personally identifying information &#x2014; email addresses or phone numbers, for example &#x2014; and match it with broader profiles of individuals.</p><p>That could be information about your education level, your religion or your interests.</p><p>It&apos;s all calculated so the organisations purchasing their services can know more about you &#x2014; all the better to sell you things.</p><p>On its website, PDL claims to have data about more than 1.5 billion people, including &quot;resume, contact, social, and demographic information&quot;.</p><p>Troy Hunt, who runs Have I Been Pwned, said <a class="external" href="https://www.troyhunt.com/data-enrichment-people-data-labs-and-another-622m-email-addresses/">he&apos;s uncomfortable</a> with the world of data brokers and data enrichment.</p><p>In his view, many operate on &quot;different levels of shadiness&quot;, especially when it comes to how they build individual records.</p><div class="view-image-embed-full">

</div> </div><p>Some firms may purchase datasets from other companies that got permission to collect it &#x2014; online retailers, for example. </p><p>Personal details could be gathered from internet surveys that only disclose they share data in the fine print.</p><p>Then, at what he called the more &quot;dodgy&quot; end, information could be scraped from websites against their terms and conditions &#x2014; from university websites that detail staff contact emails, for example.</p><p>But there&apos;s another potential source &#x2014; other data breaches that have already spilled volumes of sensitive data.</p><p>&quot;Think about Ashley Madison, and hey, it&apos;s available to download for free,&quot; Mr Hunt said.</p><p>Plenty of data brokers and credit agencies have had data breaches in recent years. Most notably, the <a class="external" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-09-29/the-equifax-hack-has-all-the-hallmarks-of-state-sponsored-pros">2017 Equifax incident</a> in which the Social Security numbers, birth dates and addresses of around 143 million Americans was stolen.</p><p>&quot;They&apos;ve got all of this data,&quot; Mr Hunt said of the industry. </p><p>&quot;They very often don&apos;t protect it very well. Or they sell it to customers and then the customers don&apos;t protect it very well.&quot;</p><h2>What can be done about it?</h2><p>Much of my exposed data appears to have been taken from LinkedIn, but that company&apos;s terms stipulate that <a class="external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#dos">it&apos;s forbidden to scrape data from its website</a>.</p><p>LinkedIn confirmed it has no relationship with PDL, nor other brokers potentially caught up in this exposed database.</p><p>According to a spokesperson, the company&apos;s investigation indicates that a third-party company has exposed a set of data aggregated from several websites, including information copied from LinkedIn public profiles.</p><p>&quot;This was not a breach of LinkedIn,&quot; he said. </p><p>&quot;When anyone tries to take member data and use it for purposes, LinkedIn and its members haven&apos;t agreed to, we take action to stop them.&quot;</p><p>You can take a few steps to try and protect yourself from such data collection, said Suranga Seneviratne, a computer security lecturer at the University of Sydney.</p><p>He suggested not displaying personally identifiable information like phone numbers or email addresses on publicly-facing websites, for example.</p><p>It&apos;s also important to check the privacy settings on the sites you use, as often data about you is simply sold rather than scraped.</p><p>Ultimately, though, Dr Seneviratne argued it&apos;s not something an individual can solve. </p><p>After all, this is data you may have willingly shared for one purpose, now being used for another without your knowledge. Until it turns up on Have I Been Pwned.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s quite difficult to identify these service providers, and also quantify and measure what they are doing,&quot; he said.</p><p>Rather, we need legal and infrastructural change to protect our data at the industry level. Or stop them collecting it at all.</p><p>Some argue it should be no surprise that data which is already publicly available on services like LinkedIn is aggregated and exposed. </p><p>But Mr Hunt disagrees &#x2014; his own information was caught in this leak.</p><p>&quot;The average person is proceeding on the assumption that when they give their personal information to an organisation, it will be respected, it will be secured properly,&quot; he said.</p><aside class="comp-rich-text-blockquote comp-embedded-float-full source-pullquote">
