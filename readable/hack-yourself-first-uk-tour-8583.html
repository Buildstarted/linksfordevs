						<p>I've been working with Troy Hunt on delivering Hack Yourself First, his 2-day hacking workshop, for a little over a year now and I'm really excited to announce something awesome. I'm going to be doing a public Hack Yourself First workshop tour in the UK!!</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h4 id="hack-yourself-first">Hack Yourself First</h4><p>Troy <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/im-teaming-up-with-scott-helme-to-run-hack-yourself-first-workshops-in-europe/">announced</a> that I'd be teaming up with him to deliver Hack Yourself First back in Jan 2018 and since then it's been a flurry of activity. The majority of my time is spent delivering workshops to organisations where I travel to them and deliver the workshop on-site. These workshops are great but often I can't talk about them or publicise that I'm doing them so most people won't know or see that they're happening. Also, because of this, it means that we're working with larger companies and larger teams where it makes sense for us to travel to them and deliver to a larger audience. I've long wanted to do something I could talk about publicly and something where anyone could attend, especially individuals or small teams where it doesn't make sense to do a private workshop. For that reason we've worked hard on planning and preparing for a Hack Yourself First UK Tour!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h4 id="the-hyf-uk-tour">The HYF UK Tour</h4><p>We're bringing 3 public workshops to the UK that will be open for anyone and everyone to attend. Maybe you want to brush up on your skills personally, your company has a small team or you want to test the workshop out with a view to arranging a private workshop, it doesn't matter, the workshop is open to all!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h5 id="manchester-27th-and-28th-june">Manchester - 27th and 28th June</h5><p>Our Manchester event will be held at <a href="https://www.thelanding.org.uk/">The Landing</a> on MediaCity which is a funky and modern space. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2019/03/image-26.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/The+Landing+MediaCityUK/@53.4727278,-2.302214,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487bae68e3faaaab:0x594f092bd273b936!8m2!3d53.4727246!4d-2.3000253">Google Map Link</a></p><p>Travel: Situated a short tram ride from the city centre for those travelling by public transport the venue is a 1 minute walk form the tram stop.
