Each member of Congress establishes their office's policy related to the processing and management of e-mail. Generally, if a member has a public e-mail address, it can be found on the <a href="/representatives">member's</a> website. The office may list a public e-mail address or provide a form directly on the <a href="/representatives">member's</a> website. The U.S. House of Representatives does not provide a listing of public e-mail addresses for the elected Representatives.</p><p>The Find Your Representative service matches the ZIP code information you provide with a list of congressional districts. If you receive an error due to a missing ZIP code or incorrect member information, please use the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ad797ac7-999f-43cc-9600-a6525af718e6" href="/contact-webmaster">Contact Webmaster form</a> to report the problem. Select the appropriate error category (Report an error in the Find Your Representative service.) and provide as much information as possible to assist us in researching the problem. Please be sure to include: Your Street Address, City, State and ZIP code, the member or congressional district information you are trying to reach and the member or congressional district the service is reporting that you feel is in error.</p><p>No. The webmaster will not forward messages to congressional offices.
