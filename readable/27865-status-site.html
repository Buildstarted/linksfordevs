This resulted in delays or errors with features such notifications, unfurls, and message posting.</p><p>During this time, approximately 10-25% of jobs resulted in errors or failure. By 10:00 a.m. PDT, we fully restored message delivery and reduced the error rates to less than 5% as the team continued to work on a full recovery.</p><p>At 1:05 p.m. PDT, a separate issue increased server load and dropped a large number of user connections. Reconnection attempts further increased the server load, slowing down customer reconnection. Server capacity was freed up eventually, enabling all customers to reconnect by 1:36 p.m. PDT.</p><p>Full service restoration was completed by 7:20 p.m. PDT. During this period, customers faced delays or failure with a number of features including file uploads, notifications, search indexing, link unfurls, and reminders.</p><p>Now that service has been restored, the response team is continuing their investigation and working to calculate service interruption time as soon as possible. We’re also working on preventive measures to ensure that this doesn’t happen again in the future. If you’re still running into any issues, please reach out to us at feedback@slack.com.</p><p class="off_gray margin_top_6px date"><span class="timezone" data-timestamp="1561863501">7:58 PM PST</span></p></div><div class="note"><p>A fix has been rolled out and all features should be working normally.
