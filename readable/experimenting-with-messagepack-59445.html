Serialization keeps me up at night.</p><p>

For many genres, saving the game state may be as simple as recording what the current level is, along with a score.&nbsp; For others, like RPGs and Adventure Games, things get a lot more complicated when you're having to save the state of every item in the game at any given point.</p><p>

There are many serialization mechanisms available to choose from.&nbsp; For XAGE, the needs are:</p><ul>
<li><b>Performance </b>- the faster the better.</li>
<li><b>File size</b> - too large a payload can typically affect performance, especially when disk IO is a bottleneck.</li>
<li><b>Ease of use</b> - from both an engine and game perspective, the user should be free to think about serialization as little as possible.&nbsp; So no contracts or schemas, ideally no per-field attributes, and built-in version tolerence.</li>
<li><b>Platform support</b> - must work on all platform, including those with restrictions on JIT.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Early versions of XAGE used XML for the game state (and still do within the editor tools, as it is version-control friendly) but evolved to use Protobuf-net, a C# library that allows you to perform contractless serialization in Google's binary format.&nbsp; This improved performance and file size significantly, but had one major drawback - lack of AOT support, required by some platforms like iOS and UWP.</p><p>

Protobuf-net initially had AOT support by pre-generating a serialisation library, but official support for this was dropped.&nbsp; The author has been waiting for <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/40162">Roslyn Generators</a>&nbsp;in order to embed the serialization algorithms in at compile time.&nbsp; Unfortunately this has not yet materialised and remains on the <a href="https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net/blob/master/docs/releasenotes.md">future roadmap</a>.</p><p>

Other serialization libraries exist with AOT support like <a href="https://github.com/rikimaru0345/Ceras">Ceras</a>, but without <a href="https://github.com/rikimaru0345/Ceras/issues/52">version tolerence</a>, so have not been considered.</p><p>

One I've had my eye on for a while is <a href="https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp">MessagePack for C#</a>, which has long promised fast serialization times and low payload sizes with LZ4 compression.&nbsp; Recently their AOT solution - a seperate executable called mpc.exe to generate the serialization logic as C# code - has become available as an MSBuild task, essentially allowing you to automate this process.</p><p>

MessagePack's benchmarks always looked promising, but it's always important to test using your own data structure - in my case XAGE's main GameContent class.&nbsp; For this I used <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet">BenchmarkDotNet </a>which has become the industry standard for getting consistent and meaningful .NET benchmarks.&nbsp; With this I was able to get results comparing the standard XML Serializer, Protobuf-net and various flavours of MessagePack (all using string keys rather than integer keys, for version tolerence):</p><ul>
<li>LZ4:&nbsp; Where the payload is compressed using this performant compression library.</li>
<li>MPC:&nbsp; Where the serialization logic is generated by mpc.exe at build time, rather than determined and emitted at runtime.</li>
<li>CoreRT:&nbsp; Using the CoreRT AOT runtime, instead of .NET Core 3.1 (where use of mpc.exe is required)</li>
</ul>
<p>
However it wasn't all plain sailing as:</p><ol>
<li>I couldn't use the BenchmarkDotNet nuget package as the latest SimpleJob overloads weren't in place, allowing you to combine a ColdStart test with the CoreRT runtime.</li>
<li>I couldn't use the MessagePack nuget package for the CoreRT tests due to some emit issues that are outstanding.&nbsp; Compiling from scratch using some conditional symbols (NET_STANDARD_2_0; UNITY_2018_3_OR_NEWER; ENABLE_IL2CPP) resolved this.</li>
<li>All my classes had to be decorated with MessagePack attributes, and all public properties not needed with [IgnoreMember].</li>
<li>Protobuf-net's surrogate mechanism (for types like XNA's Vector2 and Color classes) is not supported and had to be reworked to be more generic in order to support MessagePack.</li>
</ol>
<div><p>
Once these issues were resolved, I was able to test with the largest GameContent data I had, and the results were surprising:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uYttsG86C2w/XmPVTIyX29I/AAAAAAAAQKk/IwmXRMPT1KsVeEik4LmjU0G8TPCBuhkfACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/serialization.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="501" data-original-width="949" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uYttsG86C2w/XmPVTIyX29I/AAAAAAAAQKk/IwmXRMPT1KsVeEik4LmjU0G8TPCBuhkfACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/serialization.png"></a></p>

<p>
Note that these are 'Cold Start' benchmarks - i.e. single iteration tests with no warmup, repeated many times over.</p></div>
<p>
Here the benefit of pre-generating the serialization logic is clear to see (MPC), but the performance of the CoreRT incarnations blew the rest away.&nbsp; What took XMLSerializer 1247ms and Protobuf 848ms took MessagePack just 36ms from cold.&nbsp; Adding LZ4 compression to reduce the filesize to 255K only brought this up to 40ms.&nbsp; I dumped the GameContent as JSON in the benchmark cleanup methods to confirm the data was actually being loaded and saved correctly, as I didn't believe the results at first.</p><p>

While it would take some time to fully integrate MessagePack into XAGE, it currently appears to be the best option in the absence of protobuf AOT support.&nbsp; I just hope that .NET 5's AOT strategy works as well as CoreRT.
