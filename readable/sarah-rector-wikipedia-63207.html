<p>The parcel allotted to Sarah Rector was located in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenpool,_Oklahoma" title="Glenpool, Oklahoma">Glenpool</a>, 60 miles (97&nbsp;km) from where she and her family lived. It was considered inferior infertile soil, not suitable for farming, with better land being reserved for <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_settlers" title="White settlers">white settlers</a> and members of the tribe. The family lived simply but not in poverty; however, the $30 annual property tax on Sarah's parcel was such a burden that her father petitioned the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskogee_County" title="Muskogee County">Muskogee County</a> Court to sell the land. His petition was denied because of certain restrictions placed on the land, so he was required to continue paying the taxes.<sup id="cite_ref-ACD_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-ACD-5">[5]</a></sup></p><p>To help cover this expense, in February 1911, Joseph Rector leased Sarah's parcel to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil_Company" title="Standard Oil Company">Standard Oil Company</a>. In 1913, the independent oil driller B.B. Jones drilled a well on the property which produced a "gusher" that began to bring in 2,500 barrels (400&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of oil a day.  Rector began to receive a daily income of $300 from this strike. The law at the time required full-blooded Indians, black adults, and children who were citizens of Indian Territory with significant property and money, to be assigned "well-respected" white guardians.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Thus, as soon as Rector began to receive this windfall, there was pressure to change Rector's guardianship from her parents to a local white resident named T.J. (or J.T.) Porter, an individual known to the family. Rector's allotment subsequently became part of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing-Drumright_Oil_Field" title="Cushing-Drumright Oil Field">Cushing-Drumright Oil Field</a>. In October 1913, Rector received royalties of $11,567.<sup id="cite_ref-ACD_5-2"><a href="#cite_note-ACD-5">[5]</a></sup></p><p>As news of Rector's wealth spread worldwide, she began to receive requests for loans, money gifts, and marriage proposals, despite the fact that she was only 12 years old.<sup id="cite_ref-ACD_5-3"><a href="#cite_note-ACD-5">[5]</a></sup> Given her wealth, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Legislature" title="Oklahoma Legislature">Oklahoma Legislature</a> declared her to be a white person, so that she would be allowed to travel in first-class accommodations on the railroad, as befitted her position.<sup id="cite_ref-ANAG_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-ANAG-3">[3]</a></sup></p><p>In 1914, an African American journal, <i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Defender" title="The Chicago Defender">The Chicago Defender</a></i>, began to take an interest in Rector, just as rumors began to fly that she was a white immigrant who was being kept in poverty. The newspaper published an article claiming that her estate was being mismanaged by her family and that she was uneducated, and had a poor quality of life. This caused National African American leaders <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_T._Washington" title="Booker T. Washington">Booker T. Washington</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._DuBois" title="W. E. B. DuBois">W. E. B. DuBois</a> to become concerned about her welfare.<sup id="cite_ref-ANAG_3-2"><a href="#cite_note-ANAG-3">[3]</a></sup> In June of that year, a special agent for the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People" title="National Association for the Advancement of Colored People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP), James C. Waters Jr, sent a memo to Dubois regarding her situation. Waters had been corresponding with the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Indian_Affairs" title="Bureau of Indian Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> and the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Children%27s_Bureau" title="United States Children's Bureau">United States Children's Bureau</a> over concerns regarding the mismanagement of Rector's estate. He wrote of her white financial guardian:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it not possible to have her cared for in a decent manner and by people of her own race, instead of by a member of a race which would deny her and her kind the treatment accorded a good yard dog?</p></blockquote>
<p>This prompted Dubois to establish the Children's Department of the NAACP, which would investigate claims of white guardians who were suspected of depriving black children of their land and wealth. Washington also intervened to help the Rector family.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> In October of that year, she was enrolled in the Children's School, a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_school" title="Boarding school">boarding school</a> at the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Institute" title="Tuskegee Institute">Tuskegee Institute</a> in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>, headed by Washington. Upon graduation, she attended the Institute.<sup id="cite_ref-ANAG_3-3"><a href="#cite_note-ANAG-3">[3]</a></sup></p><p>Rector was already a millionaire by the time she had turned 18. She owned stocks, bonds, a boarding house, businesses, and a 2,000-acre piece of prime river bottomland. At that point, she left Tuskegee and, with her entire family, moved to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>. She purchased a house on 12th Street, that is still there and known as the Rector House. The house has been purchased by a local nonprofit with the intention of restoration and historical and cultural preservation.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></p><p>Soon after moving to Kansas City she married a local man, Kenneth Campbell. The wedding was a very private affair, with only her mother and the bridegroom's paternal grandmother present.

<p>Rector lived a comfortable life, enjoying her wealth. She had a taste for fine clothing and fast cars. She was frequently ticketed by the police of the city for speeding.
