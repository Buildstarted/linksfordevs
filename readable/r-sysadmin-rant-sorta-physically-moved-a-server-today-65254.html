<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-click-id="text"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>We're a smallish eating disorder and chemical dependency healthcare provider. When the company was founded 5 years ago, a lot of dumb choices were made, expensive dumb choices. The idea was the company would be HUGE in a few years, but the leadership at the time forgot that takes work and competence. One bad decision was to embed Salesforce deeply into our patient acquisition/intake/follow-up processes from day one.</p><p><strong>Exposition:</strong></p><p>One thing about COVID19 is that people having to social distance made some people realize how bad they or their family members were, with respect to their disorder. No distracting events/activities outside the home let people see their own behaviors, or their family members, up close. We do about half in-patient work, and half <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_outpatient_program" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">IOP</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_hospitalization" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">PHP</a> programs.</p><p>Our admissions stayed stead when the shutdowns started, and have stayed strong throughout the pandemic. When you're talking about patients who are literally near death because of substance abuse or eating disorders, it's not an exaggeration to say we're essential healthcare. Our patients' disorders can definitely cause them to be immune compromised, so we stayed open and took massive precautions. We haven't had a single patient in our facilities who was positive yet, fingers crossed.</p><p>But while patients were still coming in, insurers have been sloooow to pay. Collections are tight. Charges are being accepted, but insurers are just taking their sweet time paying the accepted charges.</p><p><strong>The Main Event:</strong></p><p>Our Salesforce renewal came up, and we knew it was going to be a problem. We engaged with Salesforce about creating a payment schedule, because coming up with about $160k in one lump sum by the due date wasn't going to happen. We had 75 licenses for all our various departments.</p><p>SF absolutely <strong>refused</strong> to work out a payment scheme for us on the contract payment, which was separated into three product invoices, $12k, $32k, and $123k, but all due on the same date. Literally refused, I got one email response that was just "No." Weeks of emails back and forth seemed to be going nowhere.</p><p>I thought we got somewhere when they finally set up a conference call to discuss it, but then the finance guy for Salesforce basically said "just pay all three invoices by the due date and then we'll be fine." I said, "While technically, yes, that <em>is</em> a payment plan, but I assumed you understood that the request was to break this up across several months. With COVID19, our patient count is stable but insurers are paying very slowly right now. We simply can't afford that as a lump sum." The finance guy literally said nothing.</p><p>After 20 or so seconds our sales account manager stepped in and mentioned a couple programs they're introducing for new customers to make payments easier during the COVID crisis. I asked if we were applicable to use them, he said, "Oh, well, no, I guess not, they're just for new customers." I said, "So you'll help new people but not existing customers." he replied, "Well, that's why we're on the call today." I said, "yes, it is, but I'm not hearing anything from Finance."</p><p>The finance guy piped up, "Like I said, all I can do is suggest you pay the three individual invoices one at a time, and as long as they're paid by the due date, then we'll be all caught up."</p><p>I said, "So this call has basically been just so you can say you had the meeting and made an offer, isn't it? You never had any intention of actually working with us, but now you can, on paper, say you tried. Look, if we don't work out a deal, I have to move us to another product. You can have the money over a 6 month period, or you can shut us off, and lose us permanently."</p><p>He said, "We'll see."</p><p>I said, "This is why people hates Salseforce. You have us over the barrel, and you're going to make sure you fuck us. Thanks." I hung up.</p><p>I researched other CRMs to see what would fit our company, and luckily found one. They had all the features we need, in one way or another, they were honest about what their product did and didn't do, and they had a team that was eager to help us import our data and work out the process workflows. We went into overdrive.</p><p>30 days later, SalesForce sent us a letter that we hadn't paid, and asked when they could expect payment? I said, "I have been telling you for months we can't make the full payment at once. I wasn't kidding, exaggerating, or bluffing. I told you $160k wasn't going to appear in our bank accounts on the due date." They sent an email warning us that we'd be cut off in 7 days. I didn't reply. They sent another email a day before the shut off, I didn't reply. They sent a final email the day they shut us off. I ignored it.</p><p><strong>Hammerfall:</strong></p><p>11am, SalesForce shut us off. We were already on the new product, had all of Intake trained, had our processes fairly well worked out, and had begun training after-care people. We had managed to cut the seat count down to 40 people by simply not letting people have accounts "just in case." The next week, I swear to Ba'al, Intake had the most admissions in company history. Not by a huge margin, but a record is a record. It wasn't due to the new CRM, we just had a lot of people willing to jump in, but our intake team <strong>HANDLED IT</strong> with the <em>brand new/</em> CRM system they had just started using. I can't take credit for that, our intake people are fantastic.</p><p><strong>Aftermath:</strong></p><p>It's been over two months. People like the new system more, we've ironed out the bugs, people are used to it. CEO is thrilled we pay $1,900 per month rather than the equivalent of $13k/month. Intake has a smarter system, one we designed for what we NEED rather than what we might want.</p><p>And SalesForce? Fuck'em. Don't ever think you have me in a hostage situation. I'll shoot the hostage and ask you, "now what?"</p><p><strong>Addendum:</strong> I didn't name the new CRM because I didn't want this to sound like an ad for them. They're great, I like them, they're a small company in mid-Michigan that's been around for a decade or so, and they're good honest folks, so far. Spoiler: <span><span><span></span>They're <a href="https://www.nutshell.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Nutshell</a> and we're happy with them, but this is not an ad.</span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>
