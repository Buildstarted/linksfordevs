<p>A while back I moved to a house where there was no wired infrastructure
available. The national incumbent had turned off the signals on the old copper
wires long ago without offering any alternatives. A mobile broadband provider
has been the rescue, and while they have provided a service reliable as shared
and wireless services can be, their lack of investment in technology has been
what has bothered me the most. The most prominent effect of the lack of
technology investment was no IPv6 support, which for a communication service
provider is a sure way to paint yourself into a corner.</p>
<p>Having been in connectivity exile for a while made the day the national
incumbent rolled out a fiber internet service in the area even more joyful. Not
only am I now cruising at speeds everyone else takes for granted, I also have a
provider that takes their avoidance of the impending internet addressing doom
seriously and as a consequence have enabled IPv6 service to all their
subscribers.</p>
<h2 id="have-my-provider-enabled-ipv6-prefix-delegation">Have my provider enabled IPv6 Prefix Delegation?</h2>
<p>After the initial joy of decent connectivity had dissipated I started to wonder
if <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3633">Prefix Delegation</a> was at all enabled.</p>
<p>A quick way to find out is to consult our old friend dhclient:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo /sbin/dhclient -v -6 -P --prefix-len-hint <span>62</span> <span>
</span><span></span>    -pf test-prefix_delegation.pid <span>

<p>Lo and behold, not only does my provider service regular IPv6 service on the
LAN, it also responds to IPv6 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3633">Prefix Delegation</a> requests!</p>
<h2 id="ipv6-prefix-delegation-and-you">IPv6 Prefix Delegation and you</h2>
<p>One of the underappreciated features of IPv6 is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3633">Prefix Delegation</a>.
While the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4862">IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration</a> provides a highly
scalable and flexible way for hosts to automatically figure out what address to
use, how to do name resolution, and where to route packets destined to foregin
networks. It does not provide hosts with means to provide addresses to the
many containers and virtual machines running on them.</p>
<p>My laptop has at the time of this writing four <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/">LXD</a> machine containers,
and two libvirt/KVM backed virtual machines running. Wouldn’t it be great if I
could provide the various bridges and routers used to route traffic to and from
these with routable IPv6 prefixes?</p>
<h2 id="automating-configuration-of-the-delegated-prefix">Automating configuration of the delegated prefix</h2>
<p>Since this is a laptop running <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and GNOME I’ll use the dispatcher
entry point that <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/NetworkManager.html">NetworkManager</a> provides to automate the required
configuration once we are delegated a prefix.</p>
<p>An example script named ‘/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/dhcpv6-prefix-delegation’:

<p>We are requesting a prefix length of /62, which translates into four /64
prefixes. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/ipv6-chart_2015.pdf">RIPE IPv6 CIDR Chart</a>.</p>
<p>At the point in time when NetworkManager executes this script it knows nothing
about if we were delegated a prefix and what that prefix would be.</p>
<p>We make use of the plugin system that the good old dhclient scripts provide to
handle that part.</p>
<p>An example script named ‘/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/’ inspired by the
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/IPv6PrefixDelegation">Debian IPv6 Prefix Delegation Wiki page</a>:

<p>In the above rudimentary example we configure <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/">LXD</a> to provide the one of
the /64s in the delegated prefix to my <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/">LXD</a> containers, I also update my
local APT configuration to point to the IPv6 address of the caching proxy I
have running in one of those containers.</p>
<p>Note that the latter part of that address will remain the same regardless of
prefix.</p>
<p>I plan to expand this further to configure the prefix on eligible libvirt
networks and other places where I could benefit from real end to end
internet connectivity without being hindered by Network Address Translation.</p>
<p>This post is a work in progress and I’ll update it once I have done more
experiments with how I can leverage this in my every day development
environment.</p>
