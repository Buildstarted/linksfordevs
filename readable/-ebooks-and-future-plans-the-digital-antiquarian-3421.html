														<p>I’m afraid I don’t have a standard article for you this week. I occasionally need to skip a Friday to store up an independent writer’s version of vacation time, and the beginning of a five-Friday month like this one is a good time to do that. That said, this does make a good chance to give you some updates on the latest goings-on here at Digital Antiquarian World Headquarters, and to solicit some feedback on a couple of things that have been on my mind of late. So, let me do that today, and I’ll be back with the usual fare next Friday. (Patreon supporters: don’t worry, this meta-article’s a freebie!)</p>
<p>First and foremost, I’m pleased to be able to release the latest volume of the growing <a href="https://www.filfre.net/the-digital-antiquarian-e-book-library/">ebook collection</a> compiling the articles on this site, this one centering roughly — even more roughly than usual, in fact — on 1991. Volume 13 has been a long time coming because the last year has brought with it a lot of longer, somewhat digressive series on topics like <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/06/tales-of-the-mirror-world-part-1-calculators-and-cybernetics">Soviet computing and the battle over <em>Tetris</em></a>, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/09/games-on-the-mersey-part-1-taking-scousers-off-the-dole">the metamorphosis of Imagine Software into Psygnosis</a>, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/10/a-net-before-the-web-part-1-the-establishment-man-and-the-magnificent-rogue">the world of pre-World Wide Web commercial online services</a>, and of course <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/the-game-of-everything-part-1-making-civilization">my recently concluded close reading of <em>Civilization</em></a>, along with the usual singletons on individual games and related topics. This ebook is by far the fattest one yet, and I think it contains some of the best work I’ve ever done; these are certainly, at any rate, some of the articles I’ve poured the most effort into. As usual, it exists only thanks to the efforts of Richard Lindner. He’s outdone himself this time, even providing fresh cover art to suit what he described to me as the newly “glamorous, visual” era of the 1990s. If you appreciate being able to read the blog in this way, feel free to send him a thank-you note at the email address listed on the title page of the ebook proper.</p>
<p>Next, I want to take this opportunity to clear up the current situation around Patreon, something I’ve neglected to do for an unconscionably long time. Many of you doubtless remember the chaos of last December, when Patreon <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/12/changes-to-the-patreon-billing-model">suddenly announced</a> changes to their financial model that would make a blog like this one, which relies mostly on small donations, much less tenable. I <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/12/patreon-update">scrambled to find alternatives</a> to Patreon for those who felt (justifiably) betrayed by the changes, and had just about settled on a service called <a href="https://memberful.com/">Memberful</a> when Patreon <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/12/patreon-about-face">reversed course</a> and went back to the old model after a couple of weeks of huge public outcry.</p>
<p>Despite sending some mixed messages in the weeks that followed that reversal, I haven’t ever implemented Memberful as an alternative funding model due to various nagging concerns: I’m worried about tech-support issues that must come with a bespoke solution, not happy about being forced to sell monthly rather than per-article subscriptions (meaning I have to feel guilty if due to some emergency I can’t publish four articles in any given month), and concerned about the complication and confusion of offering two separate subscription models — plus PayPal! — as funding solutions (just writing a FAQ to explain it all would take a full day or two!). In addition, a hard look at the numbers reveals that a slightly higher percentage of most pledges would go to third parties when using Memberful than happens with Patreon. It’s for all these reasons that, after much agonized back-and-forthing, I’ve elected to stay the course with Patreon alone as my main funding mechanism, taking them at their word that they’ll never again to do anything like what they did last December.</p>
<p>I do understand that some of you are less inclined to be forgiving, which is of course your right. For my part, even the shenanigans of last December weren’t quite enough to destroy the good will I have toward Patreon for literally changing my life by allowing me to justify devoting so much time and energy to this blog. (They were of course only the medium; I’m even more grateful to you readers!) At any rate, know that except for that one blip Patreon has always treated me very well, and that their processing fees are lower than I would pay using any other subscription service. And yeah, okay… maybe also keep your fingers crossed that I’ve made the right decision in giving them a second chance before I hit the panic button. Fool me once…</p>
<p>So, that’s where we stand with the Patreon situation, which can be summed up as sticking with the status quo for now.&nbsp; But it’s not the only thing I’ve a bit wishy-washy about lately…</p>
<p>As a certain recent ten-article series will testify, I fell hard down the <em>Civilization</em> rabbit hole when I first began to look at that game a year or so ago. I’ve spent quite some time staring at that Advances Chart, trying to decide what might be there for me as a writer. I’m very attracted to the idea of writing some wider-scale macro-history in addition to this ongoing micro-history of the games industry, as I am by the idea of writing said history in terms of achievement and (largely) peaceful progress as opposed to chronicles of wars and battles won and lost.&nbsp; Still, I’ve struggled to figure out what form it all should take.</p>
<p>My first notion was to start a second blog. It would be called — again, no surprise here for readers of my <em>Civilization</em> articles! — The Narrative of Progress, and would be structured around an Advances Chart similar but not identical to the one in the <em>Civilization</em> box. (Intriguing as it is, the latter also has some notable oddities, such as its decision to make “Alphabet” and “Writing” into separate advances; how could you possibly have one without the other?) I even found a web developer who did some work on prototyping an interactive, dynamically growing Advances Chart with links to individual articles. But we couldn’t ever come up with anything that felt more intuitive and usable than a traditional table of contents, so I gave up on that idea. I was also concerned about whether I could possibly handle the research burden of so many disparate topics in science, technology, and sociology — a concern which the <em>Civilization</em> close reading, over the course of which I made a few embarrassing gaffes which you readers were kind enough to point out to me, has proved were justified.</p>
<p>But still I remain attracted to the idea of doing a different kind of history in addition to this gaming history. Lately, I’ve gravitated to the Wonders of the World. In fact, <em>Civilization</em> prompted my wife Dorte and I to take a trip to Cairo just a month ago — a <em>crazy</em> place, let me tell you! — to see the Pyramids, the Egyptian Museum, and other ancient sites. I think I could do a great job with these topics, as they’re right in my writerly wheelhouse of readable narrative history, and it would be hard to go wrong with stories as fascinating as these. Up until just a couple of weeks ago I had schemed about doing these kinds of stories on this site, but finally had to give it up as well as the wrong approach. I would have to set up a second Patreon anyway, as I couldn’t possibly expect people who signed up to support a “history of interactive entertainment” to support this other stuff as well, and running two Patreons and two parallel tracks out of a single WordPress blog would just be silly.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that I’m as undecided as ever about this stuff. I know I’d like to do some wider-frame historical writing at some point, almost certainly hosted at a different site, but I don’t know exactly when that will be or what form it will take. Would you be interested in reading such a thing? I’d be interested to hear your opinions and suggestions, whether in the comments below or via email.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, rest assured that I remain committed to this ongoing history as well; the worst that might result from a second writing project would be a somewhat slower pace here. I’m occasionally asked how far I intend to go with this history, and I’ve never had a perfect answer. A few years ago, I thought 1993’s <em>Doom</em> might be good stopping place, as it marked the beginning of a dramatic shift in the culture of computer games. But the problem with that, I’ve come to realize, is that it did indeed only mark the <em>beginning</em> of a shift, and to stop there would be to leave countless threads dangling. These days, the end of the 1990s strikes me as a potential candidate, but we’ll see. At any rate, I don’t have plans for stopping anytime soon — not as long as you’re still willing to read and support this work. Who knows, maybe we’ll make it all the way to 2018 someday.</p>
<p>In that meantime, a quick rundown of coming attractions for the historical year of 1992. (If you want to be completely surprised every week, skip this list!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeff Tunnell’s hugely influential physics puzzler <em>The Incredible Machine</em></li>
<li>the seminal platformer <em>Another World</em>, among other things a beautiful example of lyrical nonverbal storytelling</li>
<li>a series on the evolution of Microsoft Windows, encompassing the tangled story of OS/2, the legal battle with Apple over look-and-feel issues, and those Windows time-wasters, like Solitaire, Minesweeper, and Hearts, that became some of the most-played computer games in history</li>
<li>William Gibson’s experimental poem-that-destroys-itself <em>Agrippa</em></li>
<li><em>Shades of Gray</em>, an underappreciated literary statement in early amateur interactive fiction which came up already in my <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/01/a-conversation-with-judith-pintar">conversation with Judith Pintar</a>, but deserves an article of its own</li>
<li>Legend’s two <em>Gateway</em> games</li>
<li><em>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</em></li>
<li>Electronic Arts in the post “rock-star” years, Trip Hawkins’s departure, and the formation of 3DO</li>
<li><em>The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes</em>, which might just be my all-time favorite Holmes game</li>
<li>Interplay’s two <em>Star Trek</em> graphic adventures</li>
<li>the adventures in Sierra’s Discovery line of games for children, which were better than most of their adult adventure games during this period</li>
<li><em>Quest for Glory III</em> and <em>IV</em></li>
<li>the strange story behind the two <em>Dune</em> games which were released back-to-back in 1992</li>
<li><em>Star Control II</em></li>
<li><em>Ultima Underworld</em> and <em>Ultima VII</em></li>
<li><em>Darklands</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Along with all that, I’ve had a great suggestion from Casey Muratori — who, incidentally, was also responsible for my last article by first suggesting I take a closer look at Dynamix’s legacy in narrative games — to write something about <em>good</em> puzzles in adventure games. I’ve long been conscious of spending a lot more time describing bad puzzles in detail than I do good ones. The reason for this is simply that I hesitate to spoil the magic of the good puzzles for you, but feel far less reluctance with regard to the bad ones. Still, it does rather throw things out of balance, and perhaps I should do something about that. Following Casey’s suggestion, I’ve been thinking of an article describing ten or so good puzzles from classic games, analyzing how they work in detail and, most importantly, <em>why</em> they work.</p>
<p>That’s something on which I could use your feedback as well. When you think of the games I’ve written about so far on this blog, whether textual or graphical, is there a puzzle that immediately springs to mind as one that you just really, really loved for one reason or another? (For me, just for the record, that puzzle is the T-removing machine from <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2015/03/leather-goddesses-of-phobos-or-sex-comes-to-the-micros-again"><em>Leather Goddesses of Phobos</em></a>.) If so, feel free to send it my way along with a sentence or two telling my why, once again either in the comments below or via private email. I can’t promise I can get to all of them, but I’d like to assemble a reasonable selection of puzzles that delight for as many different reasons as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, please do remember that I depend on you for support in order to continue doing this work. If you enjoy and/or find something of value in what I do here, if you’re lucky enough to have disposable income, and if you haven’t yet taken the plunge, please do think about <a href="https://www.patreon.com/DigitalAntiquarian">signing up as a Patreon supporter</a> at whatever level strikes you as practical and warranted. I run what seems to be one of the last “clean” sites on the Internet — no advertisements, no SEO, no personal-data-mining, no “sponsored articles,” just the best content I can provide — but that means that I have to depend entirely upon you to keep it going. With your support, we can continue this journey together for years to come.</p>
<p>And with that, I’ll say thanks to all of you for being the best readers in the world and wish you a great weekend. See you next week with a proper article!</p>
