It’s not as simply linear as merely doubling or tripling resources and org structures; it’s actually much more complex on many levels, communication to coordination. Because with great scale comes great complexity… and many, many more places for things to break down.</p><p>So how should founders/CEOs of growing tech startups think about everything from hiring (including <a href="https://a16z.com/tag/hire-these-roles-early/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key executives</a>) to product management (what is it, really, beyond common myths/misconceptions around the role?) to thinking about late-stage financing, M&amp;A, and other key aspects of building a company? This episode of the a16z Podcast shares both specific answers to — and general mindsets for thinking about — these questions. Chris Dixon, general partner on&nbsp;<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a16z crypto</a>, interviews Elad Gil, investor/advisor to numerous tech companies; co-founder of Color Genomics; formerly of Google and also co-founder and CEO of Mixer Labs (acquired by Twitter, where he also became a VP). He’s the author of the new <a href="https://press.stripe.com/#high-growth-handbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book</a>, <em>The High Growth Handbook</em>, on scaling companies from 10 to 10,000 people.</p><p>But the two also explore the growth — and evolution — of market and tech trends, including the continuation of mobile/cloud; machine learning (and silicon); crypto; and finally, longevity — both in the near term and further out in the future. Should people — and even companies for that matter — really live longer?</p><p><span class="footnote"><em>The content provided here is for informational purposes only, and does not constitute an offer or solicitation to purchase any investment solution or a recommendation to buy or sell a security; nor it is to be taken as legal, business, investment, or tax advice.
