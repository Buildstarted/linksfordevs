        <p>The Ukrainian Secret Service (SSU) announced today the arrest of a hacker known as Sanix, responsible for selling billions of hacked credentials on hacking forums and Telegram channels.</p><p>The SSU says it arrested Sanix in Ivano-Frankivsk, a city in western Ukraine. Authorities did not release the hacker's name.</p><p>Sanix has a long history on underground hacking forums, where he was first spotted operating as far back as 2018.</p><p>The individual was what security experts would call a data broker. He collected data leaked from hacked companies and assembled the information in large lists of usernames and passwords.</p><p>Sanix would then resell the data to other threat actors on the cybercrime underground, such as spam groups, password crackers, account hijackers, and operators of brute-force botnets.</p>    


        

<p>Sanix, who also operated under the nickname of Sanixer on Telegram, is the person responsible for initially assembling a series of user and password combos known as Collection #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, Antipublic, and others. These collections amounted to terabytes of data and billions of unique username-password combinations.</p><figure><span><img src="https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/05/05/db7cb23a-f476-4d9f-80be-e4908d5ee5c5/resize/370xauto/d45e77c30cef29c61cd627172f666e53/collection1.jpg" alt="collection1.jpg" height="auto" width="370" data-original="https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/05/05/db7cb23a-f476-4d9f-80be-e4908d5ee5c5/resize/370xauto/d45e77c30cef29c61cd627172f666e53/collection1.jpg"></span><figcaption><span></span><span>

                                                </span></figcaption></figure><p>These collections had been sold in private for years. However, <a href="https://intsights.com/blog/massive-collection-1-data-dump-whats-in-it-and-how-did-it-happen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">according to threat intelligence firm IntSights</a>, some of these collections leaked online following a dispute with another data broker -- Azatej, the person behind Infinity Black, a web portal for selling stolen accounts.</p>


    <p>It is believed that Azatej leaked Sanix's collections as revenge after Sanix leaked and incorporated data from the Infinity Black portal.</p><p>At the time, in January 2019, the Azatej leaks (but actually Sanix's data) garnered an absurd amount of media attention, and Collection #1 has even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collection_No._1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component="externalLink">its own Wikipedia page</a>.</p><p>Azatej, who first leaked Collection #1, and then the other data troves, has also been <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/europol-arrests-hackers-behind-infinity-black-hacker-group/" target="_blank">arrested earlier this month in Poland</a>, along with other Infinity Black members, as part of a Europol operation.</p><p><a href="https://ssu.gov.ua/ua/news/1/category/2/view/7602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">In a press release today</a>, the SSU says it found copies of Collection #1 on Sanix's computer, along with "at least seven similar databases of stolen and broken passwords."</p><p>Besides the collections of usernames and passwords, Ukrainian officials said Sanix's computer also stored information about PIN codes for bank cards, cryptocurrency wallets, PayPal account logins, and DDoS botnets.</p><p>SSU officers said they seized 2 TB of data, $3,000, and 190,000 Ukrainian hryvnias (~$7,000). Below is a video of Sanix's arrest released today by Ukrainian authorities.</p><section><p>
