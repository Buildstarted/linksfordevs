    <div><p class="TTreviewTitle">big improvement over the m560. recommended</p><p class="TTreviewBody">i ordered and i&apos;ve used both 1060c and 565c. i burned-in both for 100 hours before listening. i intended to use the 565c for traveling and 1060c at home. 1060c outperforms in every way, such that, even though 1060c is quite bulky compared to 565c, i intend to return 565c and also travel with 1060c. to my ears 565c is much better than m560 headphone, which i assume that it replaces. a couple of months ago, i ordered m560 and promptly returned them. i could happily live with 565c. it compares favorably to my more expensive oppo pm3. oppo sparkles a smidge more at the higher frequencies and offers a tad more resolution and offesr better isolation and comfort. however, oppo&apos;s is falling apart after two years. i expect 565c will last much longer than two years and monoprice offers more responsive service. i wouldn&apos;t buy oppo again. i would buy 565c before oppo pm3 and change the pads. the 565c is a very good headphone for the money. one would be hard pressed to find something better at its price point. if i didn&apos;t have the 1060c to compare, i would keep the 565c. i just know that i will always reach for 1060c over 565c -for comfort and isolation alone and then, of course, the sound. if portability is a priority, then you want the 565c. it&apos;s very good. if portability is not important, no question, get the 1060c. the additional cost of 1060c is worth it.</p></div>
