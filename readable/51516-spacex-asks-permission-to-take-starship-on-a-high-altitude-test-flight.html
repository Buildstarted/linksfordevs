    <h1>SpaceX asks permission to take Starship on a high-altitude test flight</h1>
    <div class="article-text c-gray-1 no-review"> <p>SpaceX revealed the plans in <a href="https://fcc.report/ELS/Space-Exploration-Technologies-Corp-SpaceX/0150-EX-ST-2020">a filing</a> with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The company is requesting that the FCC allocate radio frequencies, so it can communicate with the vehicle during the test flight -- that filing is standard practice. As <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21122220/spacex-starship-rocket-20-kilometer-test-flight-boca-chica-texas">The Verge</a> </em>notes, the test is meant to prove that the Starship rocket can be reused and potentially touch down on the moon or Mars.</p><p>SpaceX began <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/18/spacex-construction-starship/">constructing the next generation</a> of its Starship rockets late last year. At the time, we learned that SpaceX was building one of three next-gen Starships at its facility in Boca Chica, and CEO Elon Musk said the company&apos;s plan was to begin suborbital testing within one or two months. That timeline was ambitious, and one month later, the original Starship model <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/20/spacex-starship-pressure-test/">popped open during a &quot;pressure test,&quot;</a> which may be one reason the suborbital test flight is now scheduled for later this year.</p> </div>
