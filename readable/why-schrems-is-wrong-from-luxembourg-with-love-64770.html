<p>Other posts in this series :</p><p>By now you should know about the EUJC ruling on the Privacy Shield. I am going to keep this one short and sweet - I believe the judgment to be more far-reaching than NOYB is explaining on their website. The reasoning is very simple.</p><p>To demonstrate this let's take a look at <a href="https://noyb.eu/files/CJEU/EU-US_form_v3_nc.pdf" target="_blank">the questionnaire</a> that NOYB made available for companies.</p><p>The first question is :</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u7o_3wla8Jk/XxnVR1tBoFI/AAAAAAAAA1w/EbNCVuVO_JEnpY0Uo7eNFDoyO_EBeTU5ACPcBGAYYCw/s775/schremms1.PNG"><img data-original-height="216" data-original-width="775" height="139" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u7o_3wla8Jk/XxnVR1tBoFI/AAAAAAAAA1w/EbNCVuVO_JEnpY0Uo7eNFDoyO_EBeTU5ACPcBGAYYCw/w500-h139/schremms1.PNG" width="500"></a></p><div><p><span>We can stop right there. The problem is that for every US-based company that isn't solely working with Paper and pigeons only (and even then)&nbsp;</span><span>the answer is always <b>YES</b></span><span>. Your potential Data Processor in the USA is going to use Verizon / ATT / (you name it) and as such you will always have a data processor that is subject to FISA702 in the middle somewhere.&nbsp; As the leaks of Edward Snowden have clearly shown, Telcos are being used as an entry vector for mass surveillance. It is irrelevant whether or not your direct counterpart is subject to surveillance laws.</span></p><div><p>Let's continue regardless :</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aKG3-JexiLo/XxnWzcYvefI/AAAAAAAAA14/m3NJWaBCf1gMJARD5cit0j06Pw3B3-5AwCLcBGAsYHQ/s744/schrems2.PNG"><img data-original-height="250" data-original-width="744" height="169" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aKG3-JexiLo/XxnWzcYvefI/AAAAAAAAA14/m3NJWaBCf1gMJARD5cit0j06Pw3B3-5AwCLcBGAsYHQ/w500-h169/schrems2.PNG" width="500"></a></p>
<div><p>Answer to 5a) is: <b>You can't </b>(Quote me on this - I really know what I am talking about). There is no way to escape mass surveillance as a company in the US. You would have to build all of your communication channels on 0 knowledge proof type protocols. Even if they exist they are most likely not supported by other businesses you will have to communicate with, or by your remote workforce. </p></div><div><p>The companies that can confidently answer yes to the above may exist in some niche segments or some niche use cases. As an example - I hear you say "But we use TLS" - that's a pretty naive view and ridiculous protection against a nation-state adversary given capabilities and funding for mass surveillance by law. I know the website you communicate without even having to break TLS. Meta Data gives away a lot.</p><p>So unless you can demonstrate that every digital communication is "unbreakable" by a nation-state you are still subjecting EU data subjects to mass surveillance. So even if you are using SCCs as a legal basis of transfer, unless you communicate via Pidgeons your SCCs can be challenged and likely aren't valid.&nbsp;</p></div><p>In other words, by the end of the NOYBs'&nbsp;<a href="https://noyb.eu/files/CJEU/EU-US_form_v3_nc.pdf" target="_blank">&nbsp;questionnaire</a>, you will have understood that realistically you can't use SSCs as a means to legally transfer EU Personal data in 99.9% of the cases.&nbsp;</p><p>Sight, we all know how this will work out - we will just pretend we can. As they say in Germany "Wo kein Kl√§ger, da kein Richter" - hence&nbsp;<span><span>Support NOYB via Donation&nbsp;</span><a href="https://noyb.eu/en/support-us" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span></span></p>

<p>
PS - So in essence what I am saying is that NOYB was right -&nbsp; they just chose to say it in a very indirect manner via a questionnaire you will always end up answering no to if you'd answer it truthfully and equipped with known unknowns.&nbsp; I liked the title too much to let go of it. Sue me.&nbsp;</p>
