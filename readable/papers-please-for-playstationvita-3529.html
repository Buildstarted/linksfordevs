ARSTOTZKA
MINISTRY OF INTERNATIONAL OUTREACH
PARADIZNA, ARSTOTZKA


‚ÄúPAPERS, PLEASE‚Äù AVAILABLE NOW ON PLAYSTATION¬ÆVITA 
IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA

The Ministry of International Outreach and the Ministry of Entertainment Software Production proudly offer the popular border checkpoint simulation software ‚ÄúPAPERS, PLEASE‚Äù for PS Vita handheld entertainment devices.

‚ÄúPAPERS, PLEASE‚Äù allows any and all to experience the challenge, intrigue, and excitement of inspecting and stamping documents. Direct the heroic actions of Arstotzka‚Äôs East Grestin Border Checkpoint immigration inspector and use the Ministry of Admission‚Äôs advanced inspect, search, and fingerprint systems to decide who can enter our glorious Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested.

The Ministry of Entertainment Software Production reports that production of this software enjoyed its most rapid development schedule to date ‚Äî a brief three (3) years from announcement to release. No other software has been produced by the ministry so quickly. In the tradition of sharing successes across fellow governmental institutions, scheduling and budgeting techniques developed during the production of ‚ÄúPAPERS, PLEASE‚Äù will be shared with the Ministry of Property Registration and the Ministry of Bridge and Turnpike Construction.

As a result of their unquestionable triumph, the department head and supporting staff of the Ministry of Entertainment Software Production have been promoted to the Ministry of Entertainment Software Planning. This departmental change has resulted in a slight delay to the availability of ‚ÄúPAPERS, PLEASE‚Äù for PS Vita in the Japanese market. Expect imminent release in that territory as all licenses and permits are secured and approved by the new departmental staff.

Glory to Arstotzka.
