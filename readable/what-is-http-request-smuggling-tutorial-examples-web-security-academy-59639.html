            In this section, we'll explain HTTP request smuggling attacks and describe how common request smuggling vulnerabilities can arise.
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-is-http-request-smuggling">What is HTTP request smuggling?</h2>
        <p>
            HTTP request smuggling is a technique for interfering with the way a web site processes sequences of HTTP requests that are received from
            one or more users. Request smuggling vulnerabilities are often critical in nature, allowing an attacker to bypass security controls, gain
            unauthorized access to sensitive data, and directly compromise other application users.
        </p>
        <p><img alt="HTTP request smuggling" src="https://portswigger.net/web-security/images/http-request-smuggling.svg"></p><div>
            <h4>Note</h4>
            <p>
                HTTP request smuggling was first documented in 2005, and recently repopularized by <a href="https://portswigger.net/blog/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn">PortSwigger's research</a> on the topic.
            </p>

        <h2 id="what-happens-in-an-http-request-smuggling-attack">What happens in an HTTP request smuggling attack?</h2>
        <p>
            Today's web applications frequently employ chains of HTTP servers between users and the ultimate application logic. Users send requests to
            a front-end server (sometimes called a load balancer or reverse proxy) and this server forwards requests to one or more back-end servers.
            This type of architecture is increasingly common, and in some cases unavoidable, in modern cloud-based applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the front-end server forwards HTTP requests to a back-end server, it typically sends several requests over the same back-end network
            connection, because this is much more efficient and performant. The protocol is very simple: HTTP requests are sent one after another, and
            the receiving server parses the HTTP request headers to determine where one request ends and the next one begins:
        </p>
        <p><img alt="Forwarding HTTP requests to a back-end server" src="https://portswigger.net/web-security/images/forwarding-http-requests-to-back-end-server.svg"></p><p>
            In this situation, it is crucial that the front-end and back-end systems agree about the boundaries between requests. Otherwise, an
            attacker might be able to send an ambiguous request that gets interpreted differently by the front-end and back-end systems:
        </p>
        <p><img alt="Smuggling an HTTP request to a back-end server" src="https://portswigger.net/web-security/images/smuggling-http-request-to-back-end-server.svg"></p><p>
            Here, the attacker causes part of their front-end request to be interpreted by the back-end server as the start of the next request. It is
            effectively prepended to the next request, and so can interfere with the way the application processes that request. This is a request
            smuggling attack, and it can have devastating results.
        </p>
        <h2 id="how-do-http-request-smuggling-vulnerabilities-arise">How do HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise?</h2>
        <p>
            Most HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise because the HTTP specification provides two different ways to specify where a request
            ends: the <span>Content-Length</span> header and the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span>Content-Length</span> header is straightforward: it specifies the length of the message body in bytes. For
            example:
        </p>
        <div><p>
            POST /search HTTP/1.1<br>
            Host: normal-website.com<br>
            Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded<br>
            Content-Length: 11</p><p>
            
            q=smuggling
        </p></div>
        <p>
            The <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header can be used to specify that the message body uses chunked encoding. This
            means that the message body contains one or more chunks of data. Each chunk consists of the chunk size in bytes (expressed in
            hexadecimal), followed by a newline, followed by the chunk contents. The message is terminated with a chunk of size zero. For example:
        </p>
        <div><p>
            POST /search HTTP/1.1<br>
            Host: normal-website.com<br>
            Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded<br>
            Transfer-Encoding: chunked</p><p>
            
            b<br>
            q=smuggling<br>
            0</p></div>
        <div>
            <h4>Note</h4>
            <p>
                Many security testers are unaware that chunked encoding can be used in HTTP requests, for two reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Burp Suite automatically unpacks chunked encoding to make messages easier to view and edit.
                </li>
                <li>Browsers do not normally use chunked encoding in requests, and it is normally seen only in server responses.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Since the HTTP specification provides two different methods for specifying the length of HTTP messages, it is possible for a single
            message to use both methods at once, such that they conflict with each other. The HTTP specification attempts to prevent this problem by
            stating that if both the <span>Content-Length</span> and <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> headers are
            present, then the <span>Content-Length</span> header should be ignored. This might be sufficient to avoid ambiguity
            when only a single server is in play, but not when two or more servers are chained together. In this situation, problems can arise for two
            reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Some servers do not support the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header in requests.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some servers that do support the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header can be induced not to process it if the
                header is obfuscated in some way.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If the front-end and back-end servers behave differently in relation to the (possibly obfuscated) <span>Transfer-Encoding</span>
            header, then they might disagree about the boundaries between successive requests, leading to request smuggling vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <h2 id="how-to-perform-an-http-request-smuggling-attack">How to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack</h2>
        <p>
            Request smuggling attacks involve placing both the <span>Content-Length</span> header and the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span>
            header into a single HTTP request and manipulating these so that the front-end and back-end servers process the request differently. The
            exact way in which this is done depends on the behavior of the two servers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                CL.TE: the front-end server uses the <span>Content-Length</span> header and the back-end server uses the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header.
            </li>
            <li>
                TE.CL: the front-end server uses the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header and the back-end server uses the <span>Content-Length</span> header.
            </li>
            <li>
                TE.TE: the front-end and back-end servers both support the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header, but one of the
                servers can be induced not to process it by obfuscating the header in some way.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="cl-te-vulnerabilities">CL.TE vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>
            Here, the front-end server uses the <span>Content-Length</span> header and the back-end server uses the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header. We can perform a simple HTTP request smuggling attack as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
                <span>POST / HTTP/1.1<br>
                Host: vulnerable-website.com<br>
                Content-Length: 13<br>
                Transfer-Encoding: chunked<p>
                
                0</p></span>
            <br>
            <span>SMUGGLED</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The front-end server processes the <span>Content-Length</span> header and determines that the request body is 13 bytes
            long, up to the end of <span>SMUGGLED</span>. This request is forwarded on to the back-end server.
        </p>
        <p>
            The back-end server processes the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header, and so treats the message body as using
            chunked encoding. It processes the first chunk, which is stated to be zero length, and so is treated as terminating the request. The
            following bytes, <span>SMUGGLED</span>, are left unprocessed, and the back-end server will treat these as being the
            start of the next request in the sequence.
        </p>
        
    


        <h3 id="te-cl-vulnerabilities">TE.CL vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>
            Here, the front-end server uses the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header and the back-end server uses the <span>Content-Length</span> header. We can perform a simple HTTP request smuggling attack as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
                <span>POST / HTTP/1.1<br>
                Host: vulnerable-website.com<br>
                Content-Length: 3<br>
                Transfer-Encoding: chunked<p>
                
                    8</p></span>
            <span>SMUGGLED<br>
                    0</span>
        </p>
        <div>
            <h4>Note</h4>
            <p>
                To send this request using Burp Repeater, you will first need to go to the Repeater menu and ensure that the "Update Content-Length"
                option is unchecked.
            </p>
            <p>
                You need to include the trailing sequence <span>

</span> following the final <span>0</span>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            The front-end server processes the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header, and so treats the message body as using
            chunked encoding. It processes the first chunk, which is stated to be 8 bytes long, up to the start of the line following <span>SMUGGLED</span>. It processes the second chunk, which is stated to be zero length, and so is treated as terminating
            the request. This request is forwarded on to the back-end server.
        </p>
        <p>
            The back-end server processes the <span>Content-Length</span> header and determines that the request body is 3 bytes
            long, up to the start of the line following <span>8</span>. The following bytes, starting with <span>SMUGGLED</span>, are left unprocessed, and the back-end server will treat these as being the start of the next
            request in the sequence.
        </p>
        
    


        
        <p>
            Here, the front-end and back-end servers both support the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header, but one of the servers
            can be induced not to process it by obfuscating the header in some way.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are potentially endless ways to obfuscate the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header. For example:
        </p>
        <div><p>
            Transfer-Encoding: xchunked</p><p>
            
            Transfer-Encoding : chunked</p><p>
            
            Transfer-Encoding: chunked<br>
            Transfer-Encoding: x</p><p>
            
            Transfer-Encoding:[tab]chunked</p><p>
            
            [space]Transfer-Encoding: chunked</p><p>
            
            X: X[
]Transfer-Encoding: chunked</p><p>
            
            Transfer-Encoding<br>
            : chunked</p></div>
        <p>
            Each of these techniques involves a subtle departure from the HTTP specification. Real-world code that implements a protocol specification
            rarely adheres to it with absolute precision, and it is common for different implementations to tolerate different variations from the
            specification. To uncover a TE.TE vulnerability, it is necessary to find some variation of the <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header such that only one of the front-end or back-end servers processes it, while the
            other server ignores it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on whether it is the front-end or the back-end server that can be induced not to process the obfuscated <span>Transfer-Encoding</span> header, the remainder of the attack will take the same form as for the CL.TE or TE.CL
            vulnerabilities already described.
        </p>
        
    


        
        <h2 id="how-to-prevent-http-request-smuggling-vulnerabilities">How to prevent HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p>
            HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise in situations where a front-end server forwards multiple requests to a back-end server over
            the same network connection, and the protocol used for the back-end connections carries the risk that the two servers disagree about the
            boundaries between requests. Some generic ways to prevent HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arising are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Disable reuse of back-end connections, so that each back-end request is sent over a separate network connection.</li>
            <li>Use HTTP/2 for back-end connections, as this protocol prevents ambiguity about the boundaries between requests.</li>
            <li>Use exactly the same web server software for the front-end and back-end servers, so that they agree about the boundaries between
                requests.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In some cases, vulnerabilities can be avoided by making the front-end server normalize ambiguous requests or making the back-end server
            reject ambiguous requests and close the network connection. However, these approaches are potentially more error-prone than the generic
            mitigations identified above.
