The tool I've built recently is a .NET based, standalone local dev server with built-in Live Reload functionality and its main purpose is to serve static content locally in a self-contained fashion.</p><p>With ASP.NET Core it's now possible using several different approaches to create <strong>standalone server applications</strong> that provide all sorts of utility with relative ease. I think there are lots of use cases for standalone servers for special purpose tasks, or as I do here, for more generic purposes. This Live Reload Web Server is a good example of what can be done with very little effort.</p><p>If you're interested you can grab the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/LiveReloadServer/">Dotnet Tool</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/RickStrahl/Westwind.AspnetCore.LiveReload/blob/master/LiveReloadServer/LiveReloadWebServer.zip">Standalone Exe (zipped)</a>.</p><p>To install the Dotnet Tool (requires .NET Core 3.0 SDK and runs on Windows, Mac and Linux):</p><pre><code class="language-ps">dotnet tool install --global LiveReloadServer
</code></pre><p>Install from <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/LiveReloadWebServer/0.1.10">Chocolatey</a> as a standalone EXE (no dependencies, Windows only):</p><pre><code class="language-ps">choco install LiveReloadWebServer
</code></pre><p><em>Note: The Choco Package has not been approved yet - grab the latest which currently is <code>0.1.10</code>.</em></p><p>Once installed you can run:</p><pre><code class="language-ps"># dotnet tool
LiveReloadServer --WebRoot c:\temp\mysite\web 

# chocolatey install or EXE
LiveReloadWebServer --WebRoot c:\temp\mysite\web 
</code></pre><p>Note the different names for the dotnet tool and the standalone EXE, so it's possible to run both side by side in case both are installed.</p><p>There a few options for configuring the server, live reload, what to look for etc by using the <code>--help</code> command line switch.</p><p>Code for the LiveReload Middleware and generic Web Server can be found on GitHub:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/RickStrahl/Westwind.AspnetCore.LiveReload/tree/master/LiveReloadServer">Westwind.AspNetCore.LiveReload</a></p><p>and there's also a LiveReload middleware component that you can plug into <strong>your own ASP.NET Core applications</strong> for Live Reloading at development time for instant live reloading of server side UI content.</p><pre><code>Install-Package Westwind.AspnetCore.LiveReload
</code></pre><p>Ok, before digging into the Razor Pages assembly loading, first a little background.</p><h3 id="static-content-first">Static Content First</h3><p>My original goal for this generic server implementation was borne out of the frequent need to generically serve local HTTP content. I maintain several old JavaScript libraries as well as working on a number of locally maintained (static) documentation sites, plus several legacy tools that work with static content. For these a local Web Server with built-in Live Reload functionality is a incredibly useful and productive.</p><p>The goal originally was to simply support Static Content because that's the most common use case. The idea is that you simply start <code>LiveReloadServer</code> out of a folder with Web content and go or use the <code>--WebRoot &lt;path&gt;</code> command line to point at a different folder and you're up and running with a Live Reload Web Server.</p><p>There are other tools like <a href="https://www.browsersync.io/">BrowserSync</a>, but they are Node based. For me personally these node based tools have been pretty flakey. They work for a bit but eventually have to be restarted to keep reloading content or they slow down to the point of unusability. By building my own I can easily tweak the way it works and fix any issues as they come up. To top it off ASP.NET Core <strong>makes this functionality relatively trivial to implement</strong> and I can customize it for my exact needs.</p><p>For static content this has all been a no-brainer and it works beautifully.</p><h3 id="limited-razor-pages-content">Limited Razor Pages Content</h3><p>But I also got to thinking: Wouldn't it be nice to support semi-dynamic content via Razor Pages in the referenced site. Razor Pages allow for self-contained <code>.cshtml</code> Razor pages on disk to be served including <strong>dynamic content</strong> via it's built-in support for <strong>C# Razor syntax</strong>.</p><p>Essentially you can create something like <code>hello.cshtml</code> and then serve that as <code>https://localhost:5200/hello</code>. The Razor page can then contain dynamic C# content.</p><p>Turns out it's very easy to route Razor pages to look for content in a non-install location:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">if (UseRazor)
{
    services.AddRazorPages(opt =&gt; { opt.RootDirectory = "/"; })
        .AddRazorRuntimeCompilation(
            opt =&gt;
            {
                opt.FileProviders.Add(new PhysicalFileProvider(WebRoot));
            });
}
</code></pre><p>In order for this dynamic Web Server concept to work, the first thing needed is to add <code>.AddRazorRuntimeCompilation()</code> and adding the following Nuget Package:</p><pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation" Version="3.0.0" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
</code></pre><p>Runtime compilation in ASP.NET Core 3.0 is disabled by default, which means you're expected to pre-compile all your RazorPages (and MVC Views), so there is no runtime recompilation when changes are made. The goal is for much faster startup time and that works, at the cost of development time convenience (or runtime changes).</p><blockquote><h4 id="icon-info-circle-razor-compilation-adds-size-and-overhead"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>  Razor Compilation Adds Size and Overhead</h4><p>By adding Runtime Compilation for Razor, you are adding about 8 megs of size to a Package or build output as this Razor Compilation adds the compiler features that are otherwise omitted. There's also startup overhead as the compilation engine spins up for the first time which can take several seconds of hesitation. After the initial hit however recompilation of content is fast.</p></blockquote><p>Once the above configuration has been added I can now easily create a Razor Page (hello.cshtml) somewhere in the target folder hierarchy and then add something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-html">@page
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is: @DateTime.Now.ToString("hh:mm:ss tt")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

@{
    var client = new System.Net.WebClient();
    var xml = await client.DownloadStringTaskAsync("https://west-wind.com/files/MarkdownMonster_version.xml");
    var start = xml.IndexOf("&lt;Version&gt;") + 9;        
    var end = xml.LastIndexOf("&lt;/Version&gt;");
    var version = xml.Substring(start, end - start);
}

&lt;h3&gt;Latest Markdown Monster Version: @version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>Not surprisingly this works just fine because all the dependencies in this code are directly contained in the .NET Core and ASP.NET Core runtimes and the script is self-contained. When ASP.NET recompiles the Razor Page at runtime, it has access to all the components it needs. Cool!</p><h3 id="not-quite-full-razor-pages">Not quite Full Razor Pages</h3><p>So far everything I've described works just fine with runtime compilation. And it works because I've used only built-in features that are part of the .NET Core and ASP.NET runtimes plus whatever dependencies I compile in - Live Reload mainly.</p><p>Out of the Box this sort of generic Razor Rendering has a couple of drawbacks that don't work:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Loading external Assemblies</strong><br>Because runtime compiled Razor Pages are not pre-compiled you can't easily add assemblies to access at runtime. All that's available by default is what is compiled into the application when the static server was built originally - it doesn't look for other assemblies in the startup folder or elsewhere at least not automatically.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compiling ‘code-behind’ code for Page Models</strong><br>Razor Pages supports both script-only and Page Model pages. With Page Models you provide a C# class that inherits from <code>PageModel</code> that has page lifecycle event hooks that can be overridden and provide the ability to create support functions to minimize code inside of scripted Razor Page. These CodeBehind code files also don't work at runtime - even with RazorCompilation enabled.</p><p>While quite useful, <em>Runtime Compilation</em> is not something I have a solution for, nor is it something that really fits the generic Web Server scenario that is supposed to provide ‘static pages with benefits’.</p></li></ul><h3 id="dynamically-load-assemblies-for-razor-pages-at-runtime">Dynamically Load Assemblies for Razor Pages at Runtime</h3><p>It turns out that runtime loading of assemblies however is possible, although it requires some special handling using a built in, and not very obvious support feature built into ASP.NET Core and MVC/Pages for just this purpose.</p><p>To make this work, my idea is to allow the <code>--WebRoot</code> folder that is the base Web folder to have a <code>\PrivateBin</code> subfolder into which assemblies can be placed.</p><p>When the server starts, the server looks for all the assemblies in that folder and then loads the assemblies at runtime.</p><p>Sounds simple enough right?</p><p>I can hook up the assembly loading when Razor Pages is configured:</p><pre><code class="language-cs">#if USE_RAZORPAGES
    if (UseRazor)
    {
        var mvcBuilder = services.AddRazorPages(opt =&gt; opt.RootDirectory = "/")
            .AddRazorRuntimeCompilation(
                opt =&gt; { opt.FileProviders.Add(new PhysicalFileProvider(WebRoot)); });

        LoadPrivateBinAssemblies(mvcBuilder);
    }
#endif
</code></pre><p>Then:</p><pre><code class="language-cs">private void LoadPrivateBinAssemblies(IMvcBuilder mvcBuilder)
{
    var binPath = Path.Combine(WebRoot, "privatebin");
    if (Directory.Exists(binPath))
    {
        var files = Directory.GetFiles(binPath);
        foreach (var file in files)
        {
            if (!file.EndsWith(".dll", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase))
                continue;

            try
            {
                var asm = AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath(file);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                FailedPrivateAssemblies.Add(file + "\n    - " + ex.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Well it turns out it's not quite that simple and the above code doesn't work to make the assemblies available in Razor.</p><p>While this loads the assemblies into the server process, but <strong>they are not actually visible to the RazorPages engine</strong>. Say what?</p><p>This was frustrating as heck: I could see the assemblies being loaded into the server process - it shows in loaded assembly list, and I can even see it in Process Explorer's view of loaded assemblies. But even so Razor Pages refuses to reference any of the embedded types resulting in type loading errors.</p><p>It turns out, not only does the assembly have to be loaded, but you have to also let ASP.NET know that it's available.</p><p>There are a couple of ways to do this but the recommended way is to using  <code>mvcBuilder.AddApplicationPart()</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-cs">try
{
    // Load the assembly manually
    var asm = AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath(file);
    
    // Let Razor know about the assembly
    mvcBuilder.AddApplicationPart(asm);
}
</code></pre><p>You need to explicitly load the assembly and then notify the MVC/Razor engine that this assembly is available so that it can be referenced in our runtime compiled Razor Pages.</p><p>And voila this actually works to allow me to access my assemblies in Razor Pages now.</p><h3 id="assemblies-whats-that">Assemblies? What's that?</h3><p>We've been trained to use NuGet packages, so much so that it took me a bit to figure out a good way to actually retrieve the needed <strong>assemblies</strong> for a given package I wanted to use.</p><p>For example, I wanted to a Markdown library in one of my applications using the <a href="https://github.com/RickStrahl/Westwind.AspNetCore.Markdown">Westwind.AspNetCore.Markdown</a> package.</p><p>This package has a dependency on another package - <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Markdig/">MarkDig</a> - and so in order to actually use this functionality I have to make sure I get both dependencies into the <code>PrivateBin</code> folder where my custom application assembly loader looks for assemblies.</p><p><img src="https://weblog.west-wind.com/images/2019/Dynamically-Loading-Assemblies-in-RazorPages/Dependencies.png" alt=""></p><p>Easy enough, but it now becomes your responsibility to make sure all dependencies are present, can be found and can be loaded. With some complex packages that have lots of nested dependencies this may not be so easy.</p><p>Finding actual raw assemblies to pick out of NuGet packages is actually not so easy anymore in .NET Core, because unless you built a full, self-contained runtime publish pass, the output generated doesn't actually include all of the dependencies.</p><p>Short of extracting files directly from a <code>.nupkg</code> zip file, the only good way I could think of getting my raw assemblies was to create quick <code>dotnet new console</code>, adding the packages I want to use to the  project and then doing a full <strong>self-contained publish</strong> into a specific folder to get at the assemblies dumped there.</p><p>If you can think of an easier way to pick assemblies out of packages short of unzipping <code>.nupkg</code> files, please leave a comment.</p><p>At the end of the day this is a pain, but if you need to use external functionality it's possible by compiling code into an assembly that's referenced this way. Cool.</p><h3 id="is-this-useful">Is this Useful?</h3><p>It depends - you certainly wouldn't want to create a complex site with this, but it's quite useful for a number of simple use cases:</p><ul><li>Create a local site that has some simple dynamic content
<ul><li>Adding current dates to pages</li><li>Looking up and displaying version numbers</li><li>Displaying Build Status on Page</li><li>Displaying incremental download counts</li><li>Logging SEO referral codes</li><li>Looking up and display status information retrieved from monitoring sites</li></ul></li><li>Cross site search support for a documentation site</li></ul><p>Lots of things even the most static of static sites can use dynamic content for at times.</p><p>As Damien Edwards mentioned a while back:</p><p><em>“Are you trying to re-invent ASP.NET Web Pages”</em></p><p>No, but sort of, yes 😄.</p><p>I do want the ability to just dump files into a folder with a configuration file, that can re-use a single installation of a generic server, rather than having to deploy a separate full ASP.NET Core application where by default you can't even update Razor Pages and see the changes. And I want to be able to just use simple scripting inside of pages that I can easily update on the server whether it's with a simple Git Push operation or some sort of File deploy mechanism that's more than appropriate for (mostly) static content sites.</p><p>I can also use this same server approach for <strong>hosting</strong> many Web sites generically off the same binary installation! In other words I can install a tool like this as a generic server that can be referenced from many Web sites and re-use the single installed instance to serve content. Very useful that!</p><p>Unfortunately, ASP.NET Core 3.0 does not support serving EXE servers in IIS hosting scenarios - you have to reference a .DLL for IIS Hosting to work. This is kind of a downer, and and it required me to publish <a href="https://github.com/RickStrahl/Westwind.AspnetCore.LiveReload/blob/master/LiveReloadServer/LiveReloadWebServer.zip">a separate deploy package that isn't an Exe</a> that can be hosted.</p><p>How this works is a topic for another blog post. But again, it's very useful as it solves a very common use case for me.</p><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3><p>Loading assemblies at runtime is not something that a typical application does, but it's something a generic tool like my static Web server requires. While it's not obvious how to load assemblies and it requires some explicit notification APIs to let Razor know about dynamically loaded assemblies, the good news is that it's quite possible to do this which opens up a lot of functionality that otherwise wouldn't be available.</p><h3 id="resources">Resources</h3><div><h3>Other Posts you might also like
