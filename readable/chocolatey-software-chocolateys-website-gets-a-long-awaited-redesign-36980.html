            <p>Howdy! You might have noticed a few changes on the website recently. Chocolatey has grown up quite a lot since the initial design of the site and we wanted to bring a much more consistent look and feel. We looked out across the industry of websites for modern automation tools and were inspired to take a step back and a hard look at what we had. What we've come up highlights both our product and our amazing community, all on the same site!</p>
<p>The design is fresh, crisp, and brings many performance improvements to help you find the information you need, faster. Keep reading to learn about just a few of the key features you don't want to miss!</p>

<h4 id="a-fresh-new-look">A Fresh New Look</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages">Chocolatey Community Repository</a> got a makeover! The new look features a grid view of packages, in a clean Chocolatey theme. All the same functionality still exist, only now in an eaiser to view format. At the top of each package page you'll notice a simple tabbed interface that contains commands for you to easily copy/paste for installing, upgrading, and installing.<br>

<p>We're excited to announce that packages have an included section for organizations as well, to really help organizations reuse packages from the community repository in recommended ways. Simply pick enter your internal repository url and copy from your chosen deployment method!<br>

<h4 id="updates-for-maintainers">Updates for Maintainers</h4>
<h5 id="improvements-to-moderation-filtering">1. Improvements to Moderation Filtering</h5>
<p>You've always been able to see how many packages in moderation, but now you can filter down by packages that are "Waiting for Maintainer", or "Ready for Review", etc. Click the header counts to view the packages, or drill down further with the dropdown list that appears while in the moderation queue.</p>
<p><img src="https://chocolatey.org/content/images/blog/redesign-filter-header.jpg" alt="Moderation Clickable Header" title="Moderation Clickable Header">

<p>Are you a moderator who spends a lot of time in the Moderator Queue? Well, good news. Now you can make the Moderator Queue your default view, so whenever you go to the Community Packages area you'll instantly be taken to where you need to go. Changing your view is easy, simply navigate to the Moderator Queue and toggle the switch located near the search filters!</p>

<p>If you are moderator/maintainer/admin you know how sometimes it has been difficult to keep up in a conversation of a package. Now, each comment is broken down and organized in a way where you can easily get to the information you need and respond appropriately.</p>
