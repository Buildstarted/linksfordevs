    <div><div class="home"> <p class="intro"><b>Previously:</b> An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">impeachment inquiry is underway</a>! The inquiry stems from a whistleblower&apos;s complaint around a phone call Trump had with the president of Ukraine. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-whistleblower-complaint-regarding-president-trump-s-communications-with-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky/4b9e0ca5-3824-467f-b1a3-77f2d4ee16aa/">complaint was released publicly yesterday</a>.</p>
<h2 class="today"><time class="timeago">2019-09-27</time></h2>
<ul class="today"> <li>The first subpoena in the impeachment inquiry has been issued! Democrats from three House committees subpoenad Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents relating to the President&apos;s call with the Ukranian President and any facilitation the State Department did for his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Will Pompeo comply? Well, &quot;failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House&#x2019;s impeachment inquiry.&quot; <span class="small">(Source: <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-issue-subpoena-pompeos-ukraine-documents/story?id=65912440">ABC News</a>)</span></li> <li>US Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker resigned his position. Volker had been named in the whistleblower report, which claimed he had helped organize meetings for Rudy Giuliani in Ukraine. <span class="small">(Source: <a href="https://www.statepress.com/article/2019/09/sppolitics-mccain-head-steps-down">The State Press</a>)</span></li> <li>Speaking of Rudy Giuliani, he has kept busy reading his text messages on cable news. Not only do they confirm (again) Guiuliani&apos;s involvement, they also implicate the State Department and Kurt Volker in particular. <span class="small">(Source: <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/27/20887170/rudy-giuliani-text-messages-ukraine-fox-news-state-department-volker">Vox</a>)</span></li> </ul> <p class="outtro"><b>What&apos;s coming next:</b> The White House doesn&apos;t have a great track record with complying with subpoenas so that may be a thing. Deadline is October 4.</p> <h3>Get caught up further with <a href="archive"> the archive</a></h3> </div><div id="mail">
