Learning algorithms is not easy and we think learning together is more fun and engaging.</p><h3>Who should use binarysearch.io?</h3><p>Anyone who is looking to master coding and algorithms, whether for interviews or for fun. If you dread interview prepping, prepare together with friends or just make new ones by joining rooms and chatting.</p><h3>Is it really free? Or just a free trial?</h3><p>Yes, it's free and will always be free. No trials and no premium.</p><h3>Why did you make binarysearch.io?</h3><p>Hi there! binarysearch.io was created because we found learning coding and algorithms by yourself is slow and daunting. We want to give a fun and engaing atmosphere where people can learn from each other.</p><h3>What can I type on chat?</h3><p>Feel free to chat about whatever :), but don't outright give answers unprovoked and please be respectful. We want people to have the time to work through the problem themselves.</p><h3>What type of questions should I expect?</h3><p>We have standard algorithms and data structures questions that you can expect from the major tech companies.</p><h3>Where do I go for feature requests and bug reports?</h3><p>You can write in our <a href="https://spectrum.chat/binarysearch">forum</a> or mail us directly at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:team@binarysearch.io" rel="noopener noreferrer">team@binarysearch.io</a>.</p><h3>Who are you?</h3><p>Hi! We are two engineers from Canada and we want to make learning algorithms more accessible. We got the idea for binarysearch.io from having had to prepare for the grueling interview process at many tech companies. We found that by working on problems with friends we had a lot of fun and learned much faster.</p><h3>How can I get started?</h3><p><span>You can get started right down below!</span></p></div></section></div></div></div>
