In other words, it’s content that doesn’t even <em>exist</em> yet. Karl is a philosophy professor who has been writing about basic income for decades. Perhaps YouTube is employing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>Minority-Report</em></a>-style PreCrime unit that foresees Karl committing an act so heinous as to get the entire channel banned. But I don’t think so.</p><p id="87fb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Could there be a copyright problem with the channel? Most weeks, we discuss excerpts from relevant articles or occasionally clips from videos or podcasts.

And when I read the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Terms of Service</a>, nothing stands out to me. There’s certainly nothing in there that would warrant immediate permanent termination of the Boston Basic Income account.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*cp0Z1o8yZyezg4hnThzEvQ.png?q=20" width="761" height="116" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="761" height="116" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*cp0Z1o8yZyezg4hnThzEvQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*cp0Z1o8yZyezg4hnThzEvQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*cp0Z1o8yZyezg4hnThzEvQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*cp0Z1o8yZyezg4hnThzEvQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/761/1*cp0Z1o8yZyezg4hnThzEvQ.png"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="78ab" data-selectable-paragraph="">So, what happened? Two days ago (Thursday April 9, 2020), I received two emails from YouTube 26 minutes apart.</p><p id="abd7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Here’s the first one.</p><blockquote><p>Boston Basic Income, your content violated YouTube’s Community Guidelines and has been removed</p></blockquote><figure><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/22/1*OuFaDfAcMIEaDOL2bcHrzQ.png?q=20" width="598" height="1632" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="598" height="1632" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*OuFaDfAcMIEaDOL2bcHrzQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*OuFaDfAcMIEaDOL2bcHrzQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1196/1*OuFaDfAcMIEaDOL2bcHrzQ.png 598w" sizes="598px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="0098" data-selectable-paragraph="">This looks like a simple warning about a minor content violation, right?

That’s as good a guess as any, I suppose. I chose the image because, for obvious reasons, it evokes the concept of private property.

Look at that genuine smile. He’s harmless. I can’t imagine that this is anything other than a mistake on YouTube’s part. But what’s shocking is that they don’t have more safeguards in place before immediately hitting the “permanent termination” button on someone’s account. Speaking of which, here’s the second email I received 26 minutes later.</p><blockquote><p>YouTube Account Notification</p></blockquote><figure><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ty5UtFlQliGvffeg59KbiQ.png?q=20" width="622" height="402" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="622" height="402" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ty5UtFlQliGvffeg59KbiQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ty5UtFlQliGvffeg59KbiQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1244/1*ty5UtFlQliGvffeg59KbiQ.png 622w" sizes="622px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="e65a" data-selectable-paragraph="">Yikes.

Well, Alex I’m sorry to read this but I’m afraid that Youtube is not part of the core suite of G Suite services defined at <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/terms/user_features.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://gsuite.google.com/terms/user_features.html</a></p><p id="b71e" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Google Cloud Support, Luisana:</strong> This is out of the scope of our support, I don’t have any control over this however, allow me a moment to investigate in their Help Center to see if there is anything that can be done to have them reconsider.</p><p id="9c27" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Alex Howlett:</strong> Thanks.

They only have contact via email once they review your appeal closely. About contacting G Suite, it doesn’t really apply to your case since this account is fully active at the moment.</p><p id="2616" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Alex Howlett:</strong> Hmm.</p><p id="4386" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Alex Howlett:</strong> This is the email I received.</p><p id="c8bd" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Alex Howlett:</strong> Customer attached g-suite.png: &lt;snip&gt;</p><p id="fce2" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Alex Howlett:</strong> (after filling out the appeal form for YouTube)</p><p id="3063" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Google Cloud Support, Luisana:</strong> OK, I am checking here and all I see that can be done about this is fill out the appeal form you already submitted.
