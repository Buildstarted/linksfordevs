<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>On November 1, 2019, I received an email stating that I had been awarded Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies for my community contributions.</p>

<p>I was actually in a conference call with some work folks when I received the email, and I may have - MAY - have got a little excited and interjected that I had received it.  Okay, not ‚Äúmay‚Äù, definitely ‚Äúdid‚Äù.</p>

<p>I was nominated back in June (or July?) of 2019, so I knew I was ‚Äúin the system‚Äù.  I regularly had to go and log contributions into the website for things that I had done.  And, that‚Äôs when it hit me.  I hadn‚Äôt <em>just</em> got nominated for <em>current</em> contributions. You see, I had to log, approximately, the last year‚Äôs worth. I realized while doing that, that I had been doing some of those things for a while.  And, while I most likely said to myself at some point, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go for MVP‚Äù, I had been working towards it for quite some time without necessarily realizing it.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>Because I was doing what I loved doing.  It just so happens that a lot of what I love doing, overlaps into MVP territory.</p>

<p>You see, I had started submitting PRs against documentation to various repositories (though, honestly, mostly Microsoft docs because thats usually where I spend most of my time).  I started open sourcing my own creations (you can find them on my <a href="https://luv2.dev/github">github profile</a>).  Some of those creations were developed on my <a href="http://live.codingwithcalvin.tv/">live stream</a> (which I also started during that time frame).  Of course, one of the unfortunate things about streaming on Twitch is that the videos will ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù after a short time period, so I also ending up starting a <a href="http://archive.codingwithcalvin.tv/">YouTube channel</a> where I push all of the recordingsI made conscious decisions to volunteer in the community, because, well, I love the community. Then, I started a <a href="https://www.dotnetbytes.fm/">podcast</a> - because one has to these days, but also because I think its fun (we just released our 11th episode!).</p>

<p>What I‚Äôm saying is, I was going for MVP and didn‚Äôt even realize it until much later because I was making the contributions <em>to help others</em> and <em>have fun</em>.  I hope that‚Äôs why you‚Äôll get it, too.</p>

<p>If you have questions, please feel free to reach out - comment here, twitter, email, etc., whatever works best for you.</p>
