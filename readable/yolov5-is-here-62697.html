				<h3 id="less-than-50-days-after-the-release-yolov4-yolov5-improves-state-of-the-art-for-realtime-object-detection-">Less than 50 days after the release YOLOv4, YOLOv5 improves state-of-the-art for realtime object detection.</h3><p><br>Realtime object detection is improving quickly. The <em>rate of improvement</em> is improving even more quickly. The results are stunning.</p><p>On March 18, Google <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/18/google-ai-open-sources-efficientdet-for-state-of-the-art-object-detection/">open sourced</a> their implementation of <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/efficientdet">EfficientDet</a>, a fast-training model with various sizes, one of which offers realtime output. On April 23, Alexey Bochoviskiy et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934">open sourced</a> <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov4">YOLOv4</a>. On June 9, Glenn Jocher <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5">open sourced</a> an implementation of <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov5">YOLOv5</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-evolution-of-yolo-models">The Evolution of YOLO Models</h3><p>YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a family of models that PJ Reddie originally coined with a 2016 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf">publication</a>. YOLO models are infamous for being highly performant yet incredibly small â€“ making them ideal candidates for realtime conditions and on-device deployment environments.</p><p>PJ Reddie's research team is responsible for subsequently introducing YOLOv2 and <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolo-v3-pytorch">YOLOv3</a>, both of which made continued improvement in both model performance and model speed. In February 2020, PJ Reddie noted he would discontinue research in computer vision.</p><p>In April 2020, Alexey Bochkovskiy, Chien-Yao Wang, and Hong-Yuan Mark Liao introduced <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov4">YOLOv4</a>, demonstrating impressive gains.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/yolov4-results.png"><figcaption>Image via the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10934.pdf">YOLOv4 paper</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Notably, many of YOLOv4's improvements came from improved <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/yolov4-data-augmentation/">data augmentation</a> as much as model architecture. (We've written a <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">breakdown on YOLOv4</a> as well as <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/training-yolov4-on-a-custom-dataset/">how to train a YOLOv4 model on custom objects</a>.)</p><h3 id="yolov5-the-leader-in-realtime-object-detection">YOLOv5: The Leader in Realtime Object Detection</h3><p>Glenn Jocher released <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov5">YOLOv5</a> with a number of differences and improvements. (Notably, Glenn is the creator of mosaic augmentation, which is an included technique in what improved YOLOv4.) The <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5">release of YOLOv5</a> includes five different models sizes: YOLOv5s (smallest), YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, YOLOv5x (largest).</p><p>Let's breakdown YOLOv5. How does YOLOv5 compare?</p><p>First, this is the first native release of models in the YOLO family to be written in PyTorch first rather than PJ Reddie's Darknet. Darknet is an incredibly flexible research framework, but it is not built with production environments in mind. It has a smaller community of users. Taken together, this results in Darknet being more challenging to configure and less production-ready.</p><p>Because YOLOv5 is implemented in PyTorch initially, it benefits from the established PyTorch ecosystem: support is simpler, and deployment is easier. Moreover as a more widely known research framework, iterating on YOLOv5 may be easier for the broader research community. This also makes deploying to mobile devices simpler as the model can be compiled to ONNX and CoreML with ease.</p><p>Second, YOLOv5 is fast â€“ blazingly fast. In a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gDZ2xcTOgR39tGGs-EZ6i3RTs16wmzZQ#scrollTo=GD9gUQpaBxNa">YOLOv5 Colab notebook</a>, running a Tesla P100, we saw inference times up to 0.007 seconds per image, meaning <strong>140 frames per second (FPS)</strong>! By contrast, YOLOv4 achieved 50 FPS after having been converted to the same Ultralytics PyTorch library.</p><p>Third, YOLOv5 is accurate. In our tests on the <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/bccd">blood cell count and detection (BCCD) dataset</a>, we achieved roughly 0.895 mean average precision (<a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">mAP</a>) after training for just 100 epochs. Admittedly, we saw comparable performance from EfficientDet and YOLOv4, but it is rare to see such across-the-board performance improvements without any loss in accuracy.</p><p>Fourth, YOLOv5 is small. Specifically, a weights file for YOLOv5 is 27 megabytes. Our weights file for YOLOv4 (with Darknet architecture) is 244 megabytes. <strong>YOLOv5 is nearly 90 percent smaller</strong> than YOLOv4. This means YOLOv5 can be deployed to embedded devices much more easily.</p><p>Many of these changes are well-summarized in YOLOv5's graphic measuring performance.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/yolov5-performance.png"><figcaption>YOLO is more accurate and faster than EfficientDet. <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5">Credit: Glenn Jocher</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="get-started-with-yolov5">Get Started with YOLOv5</h3><p>We're eager to see what you are able to build with new state-of-the-art detectors. </p><p>To that end, we've published a guide on <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/how-to-train-yolov5-on-a-custom-dataset/">how to train YOLOv5 on a custom dataset</a>, making it quick and easy. If you would like to use standard COCO weights, see <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb">this notebook</a>.</p><p>You can always visit <a href="https://yolov5.com/">YOLOv5.com</a> for more resources as they become available.</p><p>Stay tuned for additional deeper dives on YOLOv5, and good luck building!</p>
