The property has inspired three separate anime series and countless films since 1973. While the franchise has seen distribution in many countries, exposure in the English-language world has been relatively limited. An English dub of the 1979 iteration called <i><b>The Adventures of Albert and Sidney</b></i> produced by Canadian children's entertainment company Cinar, is believed to have only aired in Barbados in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The show aired Saturday mornings on CBC TV 8 in the country.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[Notes 1]</a></sup> No home video releases of the dub are known to exist, nor has any of it surfaced online.
</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History"></span>History</h2><p>Until recently, information on this production had been scarce. The first reported mention of the dub was by a Barbadian user on a forum called The TFP in 2004, who recalled part of the theme song.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[2]</a></sup> Other users online have also mentioned the dub, but few concrete details of the show and no actual footage has resurfaced online yet.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[7]</a></sup></p><p>It is also known that the signs weren't translated. Nobita and Doraemon were renamed Albert and Sidney, in some order. The spelling of Sidney's name is also still in doubt: some sources called him "Sydney", while others used the spelling "Sidney".
</p><p>According to the NATPE 1987 issue of <i>Television/Radio Age</i> magazine, the dub was distributed by Cinar, a children's entertainment company based in Montreal, Quebec.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[8]</a></sup> Cinar was selling the show as 150 ten-minute episodes.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[9]</a></sup> The English version was recorded in Canada (likely in Montreal), as the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved <i>The Adventures of Albert and Sidney</i> as Canadian content on June 6th, 1986 under its dubbing category.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[10]</a></sup></p><p>It is believed that Cinar had produced <i>The Adventures of Albert &amp; Sidney</i> for broadcast in the United States on TBS. The channel had acquired the rights to 50 episodes of <i>Doraemon</i> in 1985, but ultimately never aired the show.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[Notes 2]</a></sup> Canadian musician Jérôme Langlois lists <i>The Adventures of Albert &amp; Sydney [sic]</i> as a project he worked on, crediting the series to Cinar and Turner Broadcasting.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[12]</a></sup> The latter company's cold feet are similar to the reluctance it showed other Japanese properties it had acquired at the time. Tokusatsu series <a href="/Ultra_Seven_(partially_lost_English_dubs_of_TV_series;_1975/1985)#Turner_Program_Services_and_CINAR_Dub" title="Ultra Seven (partially lost English dubs of TV series; 1975/1985)"><i>Ultra Seven</i></a>, which was also localized by Cinar for Turner, remained unaired in the United States for years. The same occurred to <i>G-Force: Guardians of Space</i>.
</p><p>In March 2017, a Lost Media Wiki contributor contacted CBC if they had information about the dub, but unfortunately, the channel had long since removed <i>Albert &amp; Sidney</i> from its archive.
