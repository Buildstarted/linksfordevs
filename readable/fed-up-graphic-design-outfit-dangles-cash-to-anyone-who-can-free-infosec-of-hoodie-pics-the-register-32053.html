            </div><div id="body">
                
                <p>Uninspired by the stock imagery used by the media to depict cybersecurity, a graphic design group is offering cash prizes to anyone who comes up with something more original than dodgy hoodie-wearing laptop users with waterfalls of cascading 1s and 0s behind them.</p>
                <p>Challenging the very foundations upon which <i>El Reg</i>'s image library has been painstakingly honed by the finest and most sober minds* ever seen in the field of technology journalism, Open Ideo wants to pump cash at anyone who can shift the age-old stereotype of the hoodie hacker.</p>
                <p>In a contest titled "How might we reimagine a more compelling and relatable visual language for cybersecurity?", the foundation urges "creators from diverse backgrounds" to apply their skill set to "this important work".</p>
                <div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/11/02/hacker.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/11/02/hacker.jpg?x=442&amp;y=335&amp;infer_y=1" alt="hacker" title="hacker" height="335" width="442"></a></p><p>"Visuals in the cybersecurity space reflect surface level understanding influenced by sensationalist media"</p>
</div>
                <p>Bemoaning the state of stock imagery everywhere, Open Ideo said: "We see pictures of locks, white men in hoodies, or green 1s and 0s that do little to convey the reality of this complicated, critically important topic."</p>
                <p>We here at <i>The Register</i> can't see what the fuss is about. Who hasn't been to Black Hat and seen cascading waterfalls of 1s and 0s everywhere?</p>
                <div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/08/31/hacker_shutterstock.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/08/31/hacker_shutterstock.jpg?x=442&amp;y=295&amp;infer_y=1" alt="hacker" title="hacker" height="295" width="442"></a></p><p>Awful, isn't it?</p>
</div>
                <p>To stimulate the minds of graphics people, Open Ideo has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openideo.com/challenge-briefs/cybersecurity-visuals">published a brief</a> about the target audiences for their challenge. They include a description of a "high-profile journalist":</p>
                
                <p>We don't know why low-profile journalists (cough cough) don't get a look-in. Perhaps Open Ideo are resigned to the idea that the great unwashed outside America will continue gratuitously publishing imagery of hoodie hackers because nobody's giving us anything better to work with – at least, not without charging megabucks in the process.</p>
                <p>A similar pen picture for a low-profile journalist needing non-hoodie imagery might say the following:</p>
                
                <p>"Up to 25 shortlisted contributors will receive mentorship from a cybersecurity expert and $500 each," we are told by Open Ideo, while five more lucky non-hoodie-artists will have $7,000 bestowed upon each of them.</p>
                <p>If you are a Russian or from Eastern Europe, however, bad news: you're not eligible for the prize. Only folk from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom, and the good ol' US of A can claim their spondulicks.</p>
                <h3>
  <span>Alright, the serious bit</span>
</h3>
                <p>Mickey-taking aside, the lack of useful imagery about what "cybersecurity" involves is a genuine problem for the industry as a whole.</p>
                <p>Joe Public doesn't know or care about the differences between a white hat and a black hat (grey hats are right out) and telly news stations, bound to compress the world's complexities into 2m 30s of footage that even your granny could understand, grab the first easy image they can think of and run with that.</p>
                <div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/11/16/hacker_shutterstock.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/11/16/hacker_shutterstock.jpg?x=442&amp;y=295&amp;infer_y=1" alt="Hacker" title="Hacker" height="295" width="442"></a></p><p>Seriously. Everyone outside it thinks infosec is some bastard offspring of <i>The Matrix</i> and that dodgy underpass near your house where the bad kids hang out</p>
</div>
                <p>By shifting that image of what a cybersecurity professional looks like, the wider industry stands to gain a lot and lose very little. Who doesn't want to be taken seriously by the wider world, all those know-nothing civilians whose very digital-dependent way of life depends on the uptime underwritten by "those weirdos in hoodies down in the basement"?</p>
                <p>As the allegedly porcine-fancying former UK Prime Minister David Cameron didn't quite say, it's time to stop hugging hoodies.</p>
                <p>Get cracking. Your industry really does need you. ®</p>
                <p>*Part of this statement may or may not be untrue</p>
