    <h2>Why Credit Scores Don't Matter</h2>
  </header>
  <p>People who don’t use credit don’t need credit scores! It’s that simple. The
credit card industry uses scare tactics to convince you that you can’t live
without their stupid score. The truth is you don’t need one.</p>
<p>Credit scores are how banks have bullied and brainwashed Americans into using
more and more credit, going deeper and deeper into debt. And it’s worked. The
average American has $10,000 in credit card debt and worries about their credit
score. You’ve probably even paid them to tell you your score! It’s crazy.</p>
<p>The good news is you don’t have to play this game. Living financially free
means you don’t need to spend one second worrying about your credit score.</p>
<p><em><strong>“What about renting an apartment?"</strong></em></p>
<p>I’ve never had high credit because I don’t use credit. I don’t even know what
my credit score is! I’ve rented apartments all my life in America. Trust me,
you’re not going to be homeless because you don’t have good credit. You’re
only going to be homeless because you don’t have any money!</p>
<p>Here’s how I rent apartments: I tell the landlord I save my money and always
pay my rent. I show them my savings, and how good I am with money. I explain
why I don’t use credit. I convince them why I’m a good tentant. Yes, some
landlords have looked at me crazy. You don’t want those landlords anyway.
Luckily, there’s a lot of landlords and a lot of apartments.</p>
<p><em><strong>“What about buying a car!?"</strong></em></p>
<p>If you can’t afford a car, then you shouldn’t buy one. Take the bus or tain.
Use a bicycle. Carpool with friends. Walk. And if you truly want a car, then
save the money to get one. Do your research. Buy an inexpensive, reliable, used
car with good gas mileage.</p>
<p>When you buy a car with a loan you’re paying more for it because of interest.
Paying more means you’re working more. Credit and loans fool you into thinking
you have more money than you do. When you buy a car with a loan, you’re more
likely to buy a more expensive car because you don’t feel the pain of using
your hard-earned money. You’ll think, “I only have to worry about the car
payment so I’m going to buy a car I like.”</p>
<p>If you already have a car loan, consider whether you can sell your car, buy an
inexpensive used car, and put that money towards paying off the loan as quickly
as possible. If not, just focus on paying off that loan and never do it again.</p>
<p><em><strong>“What about buying a house!?"</strong></em></p>
<p>I don’t even think you should buy a house with debt! The
stress of having debt is not worth it. Living financially free without
the shadow of debt is priceless. It’s worth more than any house.</p>
<p>Now this is the one instance it’s okay to break the no-debt rule (but I
personally wouldn’t). If you do get a mortgage, be sure to get one with a
fixed interest-rate no more than 15 years. Be sure there are no penalties for
early payment. Pay it down as fast as possible. Put as much money as you can
each paycheck into paying down that mortgage.</p>
<p>You can get good interest rates through a manual underwriter, despite not
having a credit score. If you have good finances you can get a good rate.</p>
<p>Why is it okay to break the no-debt rule to buy a house? Again, I wouldn’t. But
the reason mortgages are an exception is because the value of houses tend to
go up. So if you’re underwater, you can sell the house and pay off the loan.
This isn’t the case with cars, credit cards, or TVs. When you drive a car
off the lot it’s already worth less than the loan.</p>
<p>Again, I would not get a mortgage. Nothing is worth being in debt for me.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Renting is throwing money away, isn’t it?"</strong></em></p>
<p>You’re not throwing away money, you’re getting a place to live. The reason
people say this is because a house is an asset that tends to increase in value
over a long period of time. By the time you pay off the mortgage it’s worth
more than what you bought it for.</p>
<p>What those people ignore is renters can invest the
extra money they save from not paying for a mortgage, taxes, maintenance, and
insurance. That investment is also an asset that increases in value over a long
period of time. After years of investing the difference, the renter is not far
from the same financial place as the home owner.</p>
<p>But the renter never had to deal with debt, never had to deal with housing
upkeep and maintenance, and could move whenever they like. When you own a home,
moving costs a lot of time and money because you need to sell the house,
and that takes time, taxes, and fees for real estate agents and brokers.</p>
<p>So you see, when people say renting is throwing money away, they aren’t
comparing apples to apples. They aren’t considering that a renter can invest
the money they save from not buying a house.</p>
<p>But the biggest benefit the renter has over someone with a mortgage is they are
free from debt.</p>
<p>Debt psychologically wears you down. It makes you feel bad. It’s another worry
on top of your worries. Debt is sneaky because it teaches you to focus on
spending instead of earning. Just say no.</p>
<p>Living without debt is happier. Living without debt is easier. Living without
debt is financial freedom.</p>
