They’re all located in India, but try to hide that fact by using American names like Dave and Gwen. Well, my guy was pretty cool and didn’t really try the whole upselling and price haggling bullshit on a support call.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Anyway, I was getting a code from them to reset my radio service in my car. The dude just had the weirdest used of that alphabet I’ve ever heard (I’m a veteran so I’m pretty used to using it). When he got to the letter Q he said “Q as in Queer”. I kind of laughed and said “..what?”. He repeated “Q, as in queer. For example; my brother Abdul is a queer”.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I couldn’t stop laughing and he just didn’t understand why. I eventually got my problem solved though. That dude will always be my favorite customer service encounter.</p></div></div></div></div>
