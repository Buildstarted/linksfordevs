Last year your friend Karen joined the alternative music scene and sent you a sound track.
The government is recording everything,
and this year announced that alternative music is a gateway drug to terrorism
(see <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/25/radicalisation-kit-links-activism-and-alternative-music-scene-to-extremism">http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/25/radicalisation-kit-links-activism-and-alternative-music-scene-to-extremism</a>).
Fortunately, Karen encrypted the email.
<p>
Fast forward to 2035.
Stasi 2.0 has risen to power,
and has decided that, to protect society,
anyone who has ever been exposed to alternative music
will be sent to a "better place".
They still have a copy of Karen's ciphertext.
And here's the really bad news:
they've just finished building a billion-qubit quantum computer.
</p><p>
Back in 2015,
large general-purpose quantum computers haven't been built yet,
but the consensus is that they will be built,
and that they will allow well-funded attackers
to retroactively break practically all of today's deployed public-key cryptography.
RSA will be dead.
ECC will be dead.
DSA will be dead.
"Perfect forward secrecy", despite its name, won't help.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there are replacement public-key cryptosystems
that have held up very well against analysis of possible attacks,
including future quantum attacks.
This talk will take a hands-on look at the two examples
with the longest track records:
namely, hash-based signatures (Merkle trees)
and code-based encryption (McEliece).
