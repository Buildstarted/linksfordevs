				<p><a href="https://www.ams.org/images/ron-graham-2020.jpg"><img alt="Ron Graham" src="https://www.ams.org/images/thumbs/ron-graham-2020.jpg"></a><strong>Ron Graham</strong>, a leader in discrete mathematics&nbsp;and a former president of both the AMS (1993-1994) and the MAA (2003-2004), died July 6. He was 84. Graham published more than 350 papers and books with many collaborators, including more than 90 with his wife, Fan Chung, and more than 30 with Paul Erdős. In addition to writing articles with Paul Erdős, Graham had a room in his house reserved for Erdős's frequent visits, he administered the cash prizes that Erdős created for various problems, and he created the Erdős number, which is the collaboration distance between a mathematician and Erdős. He also created <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GrahamsNumber.html">Graham's number</a>&nbsp;in a 1971 paper on Ramsey theory written with Bruce Rothschild, which was for a time the largest number used in a proof.</p>

<p>Graham was known for his infectious enthusiasm, his originality, and his accessibility to anyone who had a mathematics question. Along with his many accomplishments in mathematics, Graham was also an accomplished juggler, so much so that he served as president of the International Jugglers Association in 1972, and was skilled in gymnastics and the trampoline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the&nbsp;honors Graham received are SIAM's inaugural Pólya Prize in Applied Combinatorics in 1971 (one of five people honored that year), the Carl Allendoerfer Award from the MAA in 1990 (for an article co-authored with Fan Chung and Martin Gardner), the Lester R. Ford Award from the MAA in 1991 (for an article co-authored with Frances Yao), the inaugural Euler Medal from the Institute of Combinatorics and Its Applications in 1993 (with Claude Berge), and the AMS's <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/200304/comm-steele.pdf">Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement in 2003</a> (along with Victor Guillemin). He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1983, the Gibbs Lecturer in 2000, a member of the Inaugural Class of AMS Fellows in 2012, and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>

<p>Graham received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 1962 under the direction of D.H. Lehmer. He worked at Bell Laboratories until 1999, starting as director of information sciences and ending his tenure there as chief scientist. Graham then joined the faculty at the University of California, San Diego and later became chief scientist at&nbsp;the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, a joint operation between the university and the University of California, Irvine.</p>

<p>In his response to receiving the 2003 Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement, Graham mentions David Hilbert's quote, "We must know, we shall know," and concludes his response with "And with this thought in mind, I will happily continue to keep hammering pitons into the sides of the infinite mountain of mathematical truth, as we all slowly inch our way up its irresistible slopes." Graham was an AMS member since 1961.
