Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have been very vocal about their efforts to reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels. But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. 

Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil â€“ but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.
