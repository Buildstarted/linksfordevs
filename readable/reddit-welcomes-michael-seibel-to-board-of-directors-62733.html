<blockquote><p><span>“I want to thank Steve, Alexis, and the entire Reddit board for this opportunity. I’ve known Steve and Alexis since 2007 and have been a Reddit user ever since. Over this period of time I’ve watched Reddit become part of the core fabric of the internet and I’m excited to help provide advice and guidance as Reddit continues to grow and tackle the challenges of bringing community and belonging to a broader audience.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Born in Brooklyn, Seibel graduated from Yale with a degree in political science. In 2006, he served as the Finance Director for former NAACP president, Kweisi Mfume’s Senate campaign in Maryland. Seibel then became the co-founder and CEO of Justin.tv, the interactive video platform that would become Twitch.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seibel led Justin.tv as CEO from 2007 to 2011, then co-founded and served as CEO of Socialcam, a popular social video app and another successful Y Combinator startup. In 2012, Socialcam sold to Autodesk, Inc., and in 2014, Twitch Interactive sold to Amazon for $970m. Seibel started working part time at Y Combinator in 2013, became a partner in 2014, and then CEO of the accelerator program in 2016.&nbsp; During his time at YC he also angel invested in companies like: Cruise, Brex, Figma, Triplebyte, Reddit, Paystack, Mattermost, Rezi, Rippling, PayFazz, AptDeco, Squire, Magic, Scentbird, and many others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“Few people have Michael’s deep background in tech and know the challenges and opportunities we face as well as he does,” said Reddit CEO and co-founder Steve Huffman, “so we are honored he is joining us. Not to mention, he is one of the smartest and kindest people in tech.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>In addition to his vast experience guiding companies in every part of the tech sector, Seibel has consistently promoted diversity and inclusion in the startup world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seibel lives in San Francisco, CA with his wife Sarah and son Jonathan. In his free time, he enjoys cooking, traveling, and occasionally lurking in GifRecipes.</span></p>
