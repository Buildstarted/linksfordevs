Just tough it out or you'll miss something huge.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that these suggestions aren't as scientific as understanding the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Quantum_Realm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">quantum realm</a>. They're just decent times to go if you really have to (those do exist, despite what&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2470006/kevin-feige-says-there-will-be-no-time-to-pee-during-avengers-endgame" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Marvel head honcho Kevin Feige says</a>).

OR maybe you've been avoiding it like the plague so that it's not spoiled for you. In either case, this is the perfect time to hit the bathroom before the film starts if you don't want to miss anything.</p><h2>When the San Francisco title card comes on screen</h2><p>If you made the crucial mistake of not peeing before the film, you won't miss much if you duck out now. This Ant-Man segment is about 30 minutes into the film and is mostly just Scott connecting dots the audience already knows. Sure, 30 minutes may not sound like a long time, but if you skipped going during the trailers you're already about an hour into sitting for this extended adventure and could probably use the break. &nbsp;</p><h2>When Hulk is having lunch</h2><p>This scene is just over an hour into the film, and while it's amusing, missing it isn't a dealbreaker (in fact, you may escape some cringe-y silly moments). The next 10 to 15 minutes after this scene is the safest window to empty your bladder. (And if you have other bodily functions to take care of, this is definitely the moment to do so.)</p><h2>When the New Jersey title card comes on screen</h2><p>There are no good spots to pee in the last hour of this film, sorry but we don't make the rules.&nbsp;</p><p>We repeat, there are no good spots to pee during the last hour of this film. So if your bladder's at the end of its rope, pee now! This segment is your last decent opportunity for a bathroom break. While it's filled with nostalgia, you won't be missing any real conflict and it's fairly easy to fill in the blanks. Plus, if you pee fast enough, you'll probably catch the tale end of the segment.</p><p>Or just take <a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/04/09/avengers-endgame-paul-rudd-bathroom-break/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paul Rudd's advice</a> for your bathroom breaks:</p><figure>

<p>Sister site GameSpot adds that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-endgame-pee-breaks-heres-when-its-safe-to/1100-6466426/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">when the Morag title card</a> comes up, you can probably take off also -- but only if you take a super speedy pee. You'll miss some jokes, but nothing plot-moving, which does make it a decent time if you must go. Again, though, it's still only in the first half of the film.</p><p>We'll be updating this list throughout the weekend in case we "accidentally" discover another appropriate time to go -- and let us know if you find a better time. Later, we can also include what you missed during those scenes, but for now, we don't want to spoil anything too big.</p><p><a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/04/23/avengers-endgame-review-masterpiece/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Avengers: Endgame</a> is the biggest movie of the year, still poised to break box office records as rereleases and hopes to catch Avatar's record.
