<p><code>Bfi</code> is an optimizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck" rel="nofollow">Brainfuck</a> interpreter that runs on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Core" rel="nofollow">.NET Core</a>.</p>
<h2>Building from source</h2>
<p>In order to build the project for a specific platform, run <code>dotnet build -r &lt;platform&gt;</code> in the repository's directory, where <code>&lt;platform&gt;</code> is either <code>win-x64</code>, <code>win-x86</code>, <code>linux-x64</code>, or <code>osx-x64</code>.</p>
<p>You will need the .NET Core SDK v3.0 or newer, which you can download <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Syntax and memory tape</h2>
<p>Since Brainfuck syntax is not fully agreed upon between different interpeters/compilers, I made the following choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters that are not BF instructions are simply ignored</li>
<li>Single-line comments are supported, and are introduced with the <code>#</code> character</li>
<li>The size of cells in the memory tape is 1 byte</li>
<li>Cell values can overflow (without introducing undefined behaviour)</li>
<li>The number of cells in the memory tape is 65536, thus the memory tape occupies 64KiB</li>
<li>The memory tape is allocated on the stack, so overflowing it will likely result in undefined behaviour</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiler internals</h2>
<p>The compilation process is split into 3 phases: <a href="https://github.com/Oldpug/Bfi/blob/master/src/Bfi/Parser.fs">Parsing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Oldpug/Bfi/blob/master/src/Bfi/Optimizer.fs">Optimization</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Oldpug/Bfi/blob/master/src/Bfi/Codegen.fs">Code generation</a> (links lead to corresponding source files).</p>
<p>In the parsing phase, the text source is converted into an Abstract Syntax Tree (<a href="https://github.com/Oldpug/Bfi/blob/master/src/Bfi/Ast.fs">defined here</a>), which is then processed by the later phases.
In the optimization phase, the AST that was parsed is converted into a smaller, more efficient AST. More details can be found in <a href="#ast-and-optimizations">the next section</a>.
In the codegen phase, the AST is converted into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language" rel="nofollow">.NET CIL</a> code, which is then compiled to an in-memory assembly and executed.</p>
<h2>AST and Optimizations</h2>
<p>The AST, or intermediate representation used by the compiler consists of generalized versions of BF instructions.
For example, the <code>+</code> instruction gets compiled to an <code>Add 1</code> node, while <code>-</code> gets compiled to <code>Add -1</code>.</p>
<p>This representation enables a number optimizations to be performed:</p>
<h3>Instruction merging</h3>
<p>Multiple instructions of the same kind (e.g. + and -, or &lt; and &gt;) are merged into a single instruction.</p>





<h3>Efficient cell zeroing</h3>
<p>It is a common pattern in BF code to reset a cell's value using the <code>[-]</code> instruction.
The compiler recognizes this pattern and transforms it into a single assignment.</p>
<p>Note that due to the fact that cells may overflow, <code>[+]</code> achieves the same purpose (and is also optimized).</p>


<h3>Dead code elimination</h3>
<p>In some cases (such as consecutive loops), the compiler can statically determine that particular instructions have no effect, so they are removed.</p>
<div><pre>[<span>+</span><span>&gt;</span>][<span>&lt;</span><span>-</span>]<span> =</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span>[<span>+</span><span>&gt;</span>]<span> =</span><span>&gt;</span><span> Loop </span>[<span>Add 1</span><span>,</span><span> Mov 1</span>]<span> # Second loop is not compiled</span></pre></div>
<p>Loops at the beginning of the program are also removed, as the initial value of cells is 0.</p>
<h3>Instruction conversion</h3>
<p>In some cases, certain instructions can be replaced with cheaper ones.
For example, adding after a loop can be replaced with a <code>set</code> instruction, as the value of the cell is 0 (since it exited the loop), so the 2 instructions are equivalent.</p>
<div><pre>[<span>-</span>]<span>+++</span><span> =</span><span>&gt;</span><span> Set 0</span><span>,</span><span> Add 3 =</span><span>&gt;</span><span> Set 3</span></pre></div>
<p>Also, setting a value after adding to it (or subtracting from it) will overwrite the result of the additions, so they are removed.</p>
<div><pre><span>+++</span>[<span>-</span>]<span> =</span><span>&gt;</span><span> Add 3</span><span>,</span><span> Set 0 =</span><span>&gt;</span><span> Set 0</span></pre></div>
<p>Consecutive <code>set</code>s also behave similarly: Only the last <code>set</code> is compiled, previous ones are elided.</p>
<h2>Sample programs</h2>
<p>BF programs used to test the interpreter can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/Oldpug/Bfi/blob/master/Samples">Samples</a> folder.</p>
<p>Some sample programs are made by other people and were found on the web. Such programs have a comment containing the download link, as well as the original license/copyright notices.</p>
