    <h1>Troy Hunt Returns to Denmark</h1>
    <div><div class="col-sm-7"> <img src="img/big/TroyHunt-DK.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Troy Hunt"> <p class="text-muted"><img src="img/mini/writerIcon.jpg" alt="writer icon"> Hanne Larsen &#xA0; &#xA0; <a href="index.php"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-camera"></span></a> <span> Frederik Kaare-Andersen </span> &#xA0; | &#xA0; Tech &#xA0; &#xA0; <span class="text-right">&#x1F550; 23. Sep. 2019 </span> </p> <br> <p> On Friday the 20th of September, the renowned Data Breach Expert Troy Hunt was once again doing a talk at Microsoft&#x2019;s Danish offices in Lyngby, just outside Copenhagen. The talk was done as a collaboration between the NDC conference and Microsoft. <p> A large number of the people who were there that day had previously seen Hunt at other conferences or similar talks. When asked why they wanted to hear his talk once again, a participant said:&#xA0;<i>&#x201C;He is like a comedian for programmers&#x201D;.</i> He went on, saying&#xA0;<i>&#x201C;He talks about important and heavy stuff, but in a fun and uplifting way&#x201D;</i>. </p> <p> <b>Rise of the Breaches</b></p> The talk was called &quot;Rise of the Breaches&quot;. An appropriate talk to do at a time when it has become the norm for apps and webpages to collect data on their users and consumers. In a statement released before the event, Hunt writes: <p> <i>&#x201C;A combination of more systems, more people, more devices and more ways than ever of producing and publishing data stack the odds in favour of attackers breaching more systems than ever.&#x201D;</i> </p> <p> <b>Security and Passwords</b></p> When dealing with security and preventing data breaches, the process starts with understanding people and how people think, Hunt explained. <p> <i>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the humans who are trying to get around the technology, to get around creating the password&#x201D;</i> Hunt said and the auditorium laughed. </p> <p> Talking about the predictability of how humans create their passwords, which is what gives hackers the advantage when guessing the passwords, <i>&#x201C;humans will always choose the path of least resistance&#x201D;</i> Hunt said. </p> <p> Hunt encouraged the audience of programmers to think differently than the examples he pulled forth from large corporations. He showcased numerous examples of what typically went wrong and emphasised the importance of <i>not</i> setting the usual criteria for a user creating a password. </p> <p> Character requirements <i>&#x201C;are flat out stupid&#x201D;</i>. When programming criteria, it is better if you program password fields that do not have criteria such as minimum one capitalised letter, symbols and numbers. </p> By making the process too complex, it creates an unintended effect where users re-use their passwords again and over a number of platforms. <p> <i>&#x201C;When you force people to change their passwords and they end up taking shortcuts&#x201D;</i> Hunt explained. </p><p> To counter this behaviour by the users, Hunt encouraged the developers to drop those restrictions. This would allow users to start using &#x201C;passphrases&#x201D;. These are sets of random words put together in a sentence and then used as a password. </p></p> <div> <p><b>Fact box</b></p> <p><a href="http://troyhunt.com">Troy Hunt</a> is an Australian Microsoft Regional Director and Microsoft MVP for Developer Security since 2011.

Feb. 2018 </span> </p> <br> <p><b>Digitalisation of official paperwork has entered the Norwegian public system</b> and along with it, seems to be a feeling of <em>It-must-be-safe-because-everyone-else-is-doing-it</em>. Far too few people look and check for the little padlock next to &#x201C;HTTPS&#x201D; in the URL. The padlock symbolises that the connection is secure send and all information to and from the website is sent with an encrypted HTTPS connection. <p> <b>HTTP versus HTTPS</b></p> You will note that there is one letter difference in the two, the &#x201C;S&#x201D;. HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. HTTPS is quite simply put the secure version of HTTP. HTTP is a protocol of which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The &#x201C;S&#x201D; in HTTPS stands for &#x201C;Secure&#x201D;. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. Without HTTPS, any data passed is insecure. <p> <b>The news does affect reality</b></p><br> In 2016 the Norwegian newspaper NRK published an article disclosing the fact that only <a href="https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/usikkert-nett-1.12854582"> 4.2 % </a>of all public and governmental sites were protected by the HTTPS protocol. This meant that any information entered into a public system website without the HTTPS encrypted connection could easily be hacked and misused. <p> <b>Introduced as recommended standard</b></p> After NRK&#x2019;s disclosing of these facts it has now been recommended that HTTPS has become a formally recommended standard, and new measurements have already show that usage of HTTPS has increased. <p> <img src="img/big/gul-prik.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="yellow dot"> </p> <p> Number wise Norway has 927 out of 3472 state domains that uses HTTPS, or <a href="https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/usikkert-nett-1.12854582">27 %</a>. Which is a massive improvement to the 4.2% in 2016. However, there is still some way to go, even for US and UK government-controlled domains. Similar surveys show that 40 % of government-controlled domains in the United States use HTTPS, while 36 % of UK government domains do the same. </p> <p> The usages of HTTPS in Norway have now become more widely used and information from both citizens and government officials are safe on protected websites that show HTTPS and a padlock in the top left corner. </p></p> <p class="article_tags"> <a href="/search.php?q=Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> </p> <p class="article_tags"> <a href="/search.php?q=Inside+Scandinavian+Business">Inside Scandinavian Business</a> </p> <p class="article_tags"> <a href="/search.php?q=ISB">ISB</a> </p> <p class="article_tags"> <a href="/search.php?q=business">business</a> </p> <p class="article_tags"> <a href="/search.php?q=inside">inside</a> </p> <p class="article_tags"> <a href="/search.php?q=Scandinavian">Scandinavian</a> </p> <p class="article_tags"> <a href="/search.php?q=inside+information">inside information</a> </p> <p class="article_tags"> <a href="/search.php?q=insight">insight</a> </p> <p class="article_tags"> <a href="/search.php?q=news">news</a> </p> <p class="article_tags"> <a href="/search.php?q=article">article</a> </p> <p class="article_tags"> <a href="/search.php?q=articles">articles</a> </p> <div> <p><small><i>We believe that information should be free and will therefore never put up a paywall. <br> <p>If you like reading our reports about the Scandinavian business scene and would like to donate towards the upkeep of the site, we would be very grateful. <a href="donation.php">Click here to donate.</a></p></i></small></p>
