<p>This article is about my experiences of applying a <a href="https://airbrake.io/blog/software-design/domain-driven-design">Domain-Driven Design</a> (DDD) approach when working with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/index">Entity Framework Core</a> (EF Core). I have now used DDD and my supporting libraries for two years on my own projects and client projects. Here are the bigger client projects where I used an DDD approach:</p>



<ul><li>A six-month engagement where I architected the backend
of a SASS system using ASP.NET Core/EF Core. My design used a lot of DDD concepts
and my DDD libraries.</li><li>A four-month project design and build an adapter
between two security systems – this had complex business logic. </li><li>A six-month engagement on an already started ASP.NET
Core/EF Core application to take it to its first release. The project used a
different DDD approach to the one I usually use, which taught me a lot. </li></ul><p>This article looks at what I have learnt along the way.</p>



<h2 id="tldr-summary">TL;DR – summary<a href="#tldr-summary"></a></h2>



<ul><li>I really like DDD because I know exactly where
the code for a given function is and, because DDD “locks down” the data, which
means that the code is the only implementation of that function. The last sentence
encapsulates the primary reasons I love DDD.</li><li>I have found that a DDD approach still works for
with projects where the specification isn’t nailed down, or changes as the
project progresses. Mainly because DDD functions are easy to find, test, and
refactor.</li><li>But using an DDD approach does require more code
to be written. The code is ‘better’ but using a DDD approach can slow down
development. That isn’t what I, or my clients, want.</li><li>To offset the extra code of DDD I have built two
libraries – EfCore.GenericServices for calling DDD methods in the classes and EfCore.GenericBizRunner
for running business logic.</li><li>I love my EfCore.GenericServices and use it for
lots of situations. It makes working with DDD-styled classes really easy. Maybe
the best library I have built so far.</li><li>I find that business logic ranges from something
that is super-simple up to super complex. I have found that I use three different
approaches depending on the type and complex of the business logic. &nbsp;</li><li>I have found my EfCore.GenericBizRunner library
is useful but a bit ‘heavy’, so I tend to only it if the business logic is
complicated.</li></ul><h2 id="setting-the-scene-my-approach-to-making-ddd-easier-to-use">Setting the scene – my approach to making DDD easier to use<a href="#setting-the-scene-my-approach-to-making-ddd-easier-to-use"></a></h2>



<p>I have used a DDD approach for many years, but it wasn’t until
EF Core came out that I felt I could build property DDD-styled classed (known
as <em>domain entities</em> in DDD, and I use the term <em>entity classes</em> in
C#). Once I had that I was full on with DDD, but I found that came at a cost –
it took me longer to write a DDD application than my previous approach using my
EF6.x library called <a href="https://github.com/JonPSmith/GenericServices">GenericServices</a>.</p>



<p>As I wrote DDD code I was looking for the repetitive code in
using DDD. With my experience of writing the original GenericServices library I
knew where to look and I came out with a library called <a href="https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.GenericServices">EfCore.GenericServices</a>.
This used EF Core and supported non-DDD in a similar way to the original GenericServices
library by using AutoMapper’s object-to-object mapping. But the extra bit was
its ability to work with EF Core <em>entity classes </em>by providing an
object-to-method-call mapping for DDD-styled classes (I also created a <a href="https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.GenericBizRunner">EfCore.GenericBizRunner</a>
library for handling business logic, but that that works the same for non-DDD
and DDD approaches).</p>



<p>The difference these libraries, especially EfCore.GenericServices,
has made to my speed of development is massive. I would say I am back up to the
speed of development I was with the non-DDD approach, but now my code is much easier
to find, fix, and refactor.</p>



<blockquote><p>NOTE: all my examples will come from a ASP.NET Core application I build to go with my book, “Entity Framework Core in Action”. This example e-commerce site that “sells” books (think super-simple amazon). You can see a running version of this application at <a href="http://efcoreinaction.com/">http://efcoreinaction.com/</a> and the code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCoreInAction/tree/Chapter05-NetCore3">this GitHub repo</a>. </p></blockquote>



<h2 id="why-ddd-take-longer-to-write-and-how-can-my-library-help">Why DDD take longer to write, and how can my library help?<a href="#why-ddd-take-longer-to-write-and-how-can-my-library-help"></a></h2>



<p>Let’s really look at the extra code that DDD needs to work. In the diagram below I have a trivial requirement to update the publication date of a book.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CompareNormalAgainstDDD.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CompareNormalAgainstDDD.png 756w, https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CompareNormalAgainstDDD-229x300.png 229w" sizes="(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px"></figure><p>You can immediately see that the DDD code is longer, by about
9 lines. Now you might say 9 lines isn’t much, but in a real application you have
hundreds, if not thousands, of different actions like this, and that builds up.
Also, some of it repetitious (and boring!), and I don’t like writing repetitious
code.</p>



<p>My analysis showed that the process of calling a DDD method
had a standard pattern:</p>



<ol><li>Input the data via a DTO/ViewModel</li><li>Load the entity class via its primary key</li><li>Call the DDD method</li><li>Call SaveChanges</li></ol><p>So, I isolated that pattern and built library to make it easier, let’s now compare the UpdateDate process again, but this time using my EfCore.GenericServices helping with the DDD side – see diagram below.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CompareNormalAgainstGenericServices.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CompareNormalAgainstGenericServices.png 720w, https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CompareNormalAgainstGenericServices-221x300.png 221w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></figure><p>Now the DDD code is shorter than the non-DDD code, and all
the repetitive code has gone! You can see that the call in the ASP.NET Core
action has changed, but it’s the same length. The only extra line not shown
here is you need to add ILinkToEntity&lt;Book&gt; to the DateDto class. ILinkToEntity&lt;T&gt;
is an empty interface which tells EfCore.GenericServices which entity class the
DTO is linked to. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, EfCore.GenericServices has code to handle a lot of edge-cases,
like what happens if the entity class isn’t found, and what if the data in the
DTO doesn’t pass some validation checks, etc. Because it’s a library its worth
adding all these extra features, which takes out other code you might have
needed to write.</p>



<h2 id="the-pros-and-cons-of-putting-ef-core-code-in-your-entity-classes">The pros and cons of putting EF Core code in your entity classes<a href="#the-pros-and-cons-of-putting-ef-core-code-in-your-entity-classes"></a></h2>



<p>However, there is an issue with EfCore.GenericServices that
I needed to handle – I can load the main entity class, but some actions work on
EF Core navigational properties (basically the links to other tables), and how
do I handle that? – see EF Core docs where it <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/relationships">defines
the term navigation properties</a>.</p>



<p>As an example of accessing navigational properties I want to
add a Review to a Book (think Amazon reviews). The DDD approach says that a
Review is dependant on the Book, so any changes to the Reviews collection should
be done via a method in the Book entity class (the term for the Book/Reviews
relationship in DDD is <a href="http://thepaulrayner.com/blog/aggregates-and-entities-in-domain-driven-design/">Root
and Aggregates</a>). The question is, we have the Book loaded, but we don’t
have the collection of Reviews loaded, so how do we handle this?</p>



<p>In the first version of EfCore.GenericServices I gave the responsibly
for handling the Reviews to the entity class method. This required the method
to have access to the application’s DbContext, and here is one simple example
of a method to add a new Review to a Book.</p>


<div><div id="highlighter_289199"><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p><p>6</p><p>7</p></td><td><div><p><code>public</code> <code>void</code> <code>AddReview(</code><code>int</code> <code>numStars, </code><code>string</code> <code>comment, </code><code>string</code> <code>voterName, </code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>DbContext context) </code></p><p><code>{</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>context.Entry(</code><code>this</code><code>)</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>.Collection(c =&gt; c.Reviews).Load();</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>_reviews.Add(</code><code>new</code> <code>Review(numStars, comment, voterName));&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </code></p><p><code>}</code></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>


<blockquote><p>NOTE: I’m not explaining why I use a backing field, _reviews, in this example. I suggest you have a look at my article “<a href="https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/creating-domain-driven-design-entity-classes-with-entity-framework-core/">Creating Domain-Driven Design entity classes with Entity Framework Core</a>” for why I do that.</p></blockquote>



<p>That works, but some people don’t like having the DbContext accessible
inside an entity class. For instance, one my client’s project used a “<a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">clean
architecture</a>” approach with DDD. That means that the entity class has no
external references, so the entity classes didn’t know anything about EF Core or
its DbContext. </p>



<p>Early in 2020 I realised I could change the EfCore.GenericServices library to load related navigational properties by providing an IncludeThen attribute which defined what navigational property(s) to load. The IncludeThen is added to the DTO which has properties that match the method’s parameters (see <a href="https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/improving-domain-driven-design-updates-in-efcore-genericservices/#1-simple-example-with-just-one-include">this example</a> in one of my articles) . This means I can write code in the DDD method that doesn’t need access to the application’s DbContext, as shown below.</p>


<div><div id="highlighter_403641"><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p><p>6</p><p>7</p></td><td><div><p><code>public</code> <code>void</code> <code>AddReviewWithInclude(</code><code>int</code> <code>numStars, </code><code>string</code> <code>comment, </code><code>string</code> <code>voterName)</code></p><p><code>{</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>if</code> <code>(_reviews == </code><code>null</code><code>)</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>throw</code> <code>new</code> <code>InvalidOperationException(</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>"The Reviews collection must be loaded"</code><code>);</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>_reviews.Add(</code><code>new</code> <code>Review(numStars, comment, voterName));</code></p><p><code>}</code></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>


<p>Now, you might think that I would use this approach all the time, but it turns out there are some advantages of giving the DbContext to the method, as it has more control. For instance, here is another version of the AddReview method which had better performance, especially if there are lots of reviews on a book.</p>


<div><div id="highlighter_202400"><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p><p>6</p><p>7</p><p>8</p><p>9</p><p>10</p><p>11</p><p>12</p><p>13</p><p>14</p><p>15</p><p>16</p><p>17</p><p>18</p><p>19</p><p>20</p><p>21</p></td><td><div><p><code>public</code> <code>void</code> <code>AddReview(</code><code>int</code> <code>numStars, </code><code>string</code> <code>comment, </code><code>string</code> <code>voterName, </code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>DbContext context = </code><code>null</code><code>)</code></p><p><code>{</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>if</code> <code>(_reviews != </code><code>null</code><code>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>{</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>_reviews.Add(</code><code>new</code> <code>Review(numStars, comment, voterName));&nbsp;&nbsp; </code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>}</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>else</code> <code>if</code> <code>(context == </code><code>null</code><code>)</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>{</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>throw</code> <code>new</code> <code>ArgumentNullException(nameof(context), </code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>"You must provide a context if the Reviews collection isn't valid."</code><code>);</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>}</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>else</code> <code>if</code> <code>(context.Entry(</code><code>this</code><code>).IsKeySet)&nbsp; </code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>{</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>context.Add(</code><code>new</code> <code>Review(numStars, comment, voterName, BookId));</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>}</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>else</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>{&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>throw</code> <code>new</code> <code>InvalidOperationException(</code><code>"Could not add a new review."</code><code>);&nbsp; </code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><code>}</code></p><p><code>}</code></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>


<p>This code is longer, mainly because it handles the situation where reviews are already loaded and does some checks to make it more secure. But the main point is that it doesn’t need to load the existing reviews to add a new review – it just adds a single review. That is MUCH faster, especially if you have hundreds of reviews.</p>



<p>Also, it’s not possible to think of all the things you might
do and build them into a library. Having the ability to access the application’s
DbContext means I have a “get out of jail” card if I need to do something and
the EfCore.GenericServices doesn’t handle it. Therefore, I’m glad that feature
is there.</p>



<p>But, over the last few years I have concluded that I should
minimise the amount of database access code in the entity class methods. That’s
because the entity class and its methods start to become an <a href="https://exceptionnotfound.net/god-objects-the-daily-software-anti-pattern/">God
Object</a>, with way too much going on inside it. So, nowadays if I do need
complex database work then I do it outside the entity class, either as a
service or as business logic.</p>



<p>To sum up, there are pros and cons allowing the DbContext being
injected into the method call. Personally, I will be using the ThenInclude
version because it is less coding, but if I find there is a performance issue
or something unusual, then I have the ability do fix the problem by adding specific
EF Core code inside the entity class method.</p>



<h2 id="business-logic-from-the-simple-to-the-complex">Business logic, from the simple to the complex<a href="#business-logic-from-the-simple-to-the-complex"></a></h2>



<p>Back in 2016 a wrote an article “<a href="https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/architecture-of-business-layer-working-with-entity-framework-core-and-v6-revisited/">Architecture
of Business Layer working with Entity Framework (Core and v6) – revisited</a>”,
and also in my book “Entity Framework Core in Action” chapter 4 I described the
same approach. Lots of people really liked the approach, but I fear that is
overkill for some of the simpler business logic. This section gives a more nuanced
description of what I do in real applications. </p>



<p>In the UK we have a saying “don’t use a hammer to break a
nut”, or in software principle, KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid). From experience
working on medium sized web apps I find there is a range of business rules.</p>



<ol><li>Validation checks, e.g. check a property in a range, which can be done by <a href="https://wakeupandcode.com/validation-in-asp-net-core/">validation attributes</a>.</li><li>Super-simple business rules, e.g. doing validation checks via code, for validations that can’t be done by validation attributes.</li><li>Business logic that uses multiple entity classes, e.g. building a customer order to some books. </li><li>business logic that it is a challenge to write, e.g. my pricing engine example.</li></ol><p>Now I will describe what I do, especially on client work
where time is money.</p>



<h3 id="business-logic-types-1-and-2-different-types-of-validation">business logic types 1 and 2 – different types of validation<a href="#business-logic-types-1-and-2-different-types-of-validation"></a></h3>



<p>My experience is that the first two can be done by via my GenericServices library. That because that library can:</p>



<ol><li>Validate the data in any entity class that is being created or updated (this is optional, as the validation is often done in the front-end).</li><li>It looks for methods that return either void, or <code>IStatusGeneric</code>. The <code>IStatusGeneric </code>interface allows the method to return a successful status, or a status with error messages.</li></ol><p>The code below shows an example of doing a test and returning a Status. This example is taken from the <a href="https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.GenericServices">https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCore.GenericServices</a> repo. This uses a small NuGet package called <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/GenericServices.StatusGeneric/">GenericServices.StatusGeneric</a>ti supply the IStatusGeneric that all my libraries use.</p>

<h3 id="business-logic-type-3-working-over-multiple-entity-classes">business logic type 3 – working over multiple entity classes<a href="#business-logic-type-3-working-over-multiple-entity-classes"></a></h3>



<p>For this business type I tend to just create a class/method
to do the job. I combine the business logic and the EF Core database accesses
in the same code, because its quick. The downside of this approach is you have business
logic mixed with database accesses, which is NOT what DDD says you should do. However,
the code is in one place and DRY (only one version of this business logic
exists), so if the code starts to get complex, then I can always take it up to
business logic type 4.</p>



<p>Practically, I put the business logic in a class and register
it with the dependency injection service. If there are a several different business
features linked to one entity/area I would typically put a method for each function,
but all in one class. I also have a <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/GenericServices.StatusGeneric/">NuGet Status
library</a>, which all my libraries use, so it’s easy for each function to
return a Status if I need to.</p>



<p>The fact that unit testing with a real database is easy with
EF Core means its quite possible to test your business logic.</p>



<blockquote><p>NOTE: Some people don’t think its right to unit test with a real database, but I find it works for me. If you don’t like unit testing your business logic with real databases, then use the next approach which make it really easy to mock the database accesses. </p></blockquote>



<h3 id="business-logic-type-4-a-challenge-to-write">business logic type 4 – a challenge to write<a href="#business-logic-type-4-a-challenge-to-write"></a></h3>



<p>For this business type, then its correct to apply a strong
DDD approach, as shown in my article “<a href="https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/architecture-of-business-layer-working-with-entity-framework-core-and-v6-revisited/">Architecture
of Business Layer working with Entity Framework (Core and v6) – revisited</a>”.
That means I separate the business logic from the database access code by
creating a specific repository class for just that business logic. It does take
more code/time to do, but the advantages are:</p>



<ul><li>Your business logic works on a series of in-memory
classes. I find that makes the writing the code much easier, as you’re not
having to think about the database side at the same time.</li><li>If the database classes aren’t a good fit for
the business logic you can create your own business-only classes. Then you handle
the mapping of the business-only classes to the database classes in the repository
part.</li><li>It very easy to mock the database, because the business
logic used a repository pattern to handle the database accesses.</li></ul><p>I generally use my EfCore.GenericBizRunner library with this
complex type of business logic, but it can be used for business type 3 too. The
library is helpful because it can adapt the input and output of the business logic,
which helps to handle the mismatch between the business logic level and the
front end – bit like a mini DDD anticorruption layer (see the article “<a href="https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/wrapping-your-business-logic-with-anti-corruption-layers-net-core/">Wrapping
your business logic with anti-corruption layers</a>”). </p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>



<p>I hope this article will help people who are starting to use
DDD. Obviously, this is my approach and experience of using DDD, and there is
no right answer. Someone else might use a very different approach to DDD, but hopefully
we all agree that Eric Evans’s Domain-Driven Design book has been one of the
key books in making all of us think more about the business (domain) needs
rather than the technology. </p>



<p>Nowadays we build really complex applications really quickly
because the millions of libraries and documentation that is so easy to access.
But as Eric Evans said in his book “When the domain is complex, this is a difficult
task, calling for the concentrated effort of talented and skilled people”. That
means we need to up our game as developers if we are going to build applications
that a) work, b) perform well, and c) doesn’t become an unmanageable “ball of mud”.
