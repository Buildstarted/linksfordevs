"<i>So You Want To Talk About Race</i> is a landmark book for our times. Oluo does more than deliver tough, blunt truths about the realities of racism, power and oppression. She also, in bracing fashion, offers a vision of hope; a message that through dialogue and struggle, we can emancipate ourselves from what she calls 'the nation's oldest pyramid scheme: white supremacy.' That is why I don't think this is merely one of the most important books of the last decade. It is also one of the most optimistic. To write such a book in these difficult times is in and of itself, a daring and beautiful act."―<b>Dave Zirin</b>, <b><i>sports editor at <i>The Nation</i> and author of <i>What's My Name, Fool?: Sports and Resistance in the United States</i></i></b></p><p>"Ijeoma Oluo-writing on any subject-is compassionate brilliance personified, and I am so grateful for her work and her voice. She is the first writer I name when anyone asks who they should read to help them think about and navigate issues of race and identity, help them understand what solidarity means and what it requires of all of us. <i>So You Want to Talk About Race</i> is a book for everyone, but especially for people of color who need to feel seen and heard."―<b>Nicole Chung</b>, <b><i>author of <i>All You Can Ever Know</i></i></b></p><p>"Ijeoma Oluo's <i>So You Want to Talk About Race</i> is a welcome gift to us all -- a critical offering during a moment when the hard work of social transformation is hampered by the inability of anyone who benefits from systemic racism to reckon with its costs. Oluo's mandate is clear and powerful: change will not come unless we are brave enough to name and remove the many forces at work strangling freedom. Racial supremacy is but one of those forces." <br>―<b>Darnell L. Moore</b>, <b><i>author of <i>No Ashes in the Fire</i></i></b></p><p>"Read it, then recommend it to everyone you know."―<b><i><b><i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, "One of 10 Books to Read in 2018"</b></i></b></p><p>"Impassioned and unflinching" <br>―<b><i><b>Vogue.com</b></i></b></p><p>"Simply put: Ijeoma Oluo is a necessary voice and intellectual for these times, and any time, truth be told. Her ability to write so smartly and honestly with strokes of humor about race in America is heaven sent and demonstrates just how desperately we <i>all</i> need to be talking about race, and perhaps, more importantly, this insightful book shows those in power or privilege how they need to <i>listen."</i>―<b>Phoebe Robinson</b>, <b><i><i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>You Can't Touch My Hair</i> and <i>Everything's Trash, But It's Okay</i></i></b></p><p>"What Ijeoma Oluo has done, and continues to do, is nothing short of revolutionary -- she has created a conversational guide and laid out a movement-building blueprint for people of all races who are invested in self-assessment, open to being challenged, and committed to collective progress. One of the most important voices of our time, Oluo encourages us to be the conversation starters in our own lives and to keep talking -- someone who needs to hear us is listening."―<b>Feminista Jones</b>, <b><i>author of <i>Reclaiming Our Space</i></i></b></p><p>"I don't think I've ever seen a writer have such an instant, visceral, electric impact on readers. Ijeoma Oluo's intellectual clarity and moral sure-footedness make her the kind of unstoppable force that obliterates the very concept of immovable objects."―<b>Lindy West</b>, <b><i><b><i>New York Times-</i>bestselling author of <i>Shrill</i></b></i></b></p><p>"<i>So You Want to Talk About Race</i> strikes the perfect balance of direct and brutally honest without being preachy or, worse, condescending. Regardless of your comfort level, educational background, or experience when it comes to talking about race, Ijeoma has created a wonderful tool to help broach these conversations and help us work toward a better world for people of color from all walks of life." <br>―<b>Franchesca Ramsey</b>, <b><i>host and executive producer of MTV's <i>Decoded</i> and author of <i>Well, That Escalated Quickly</i></i></b></p><p>"You are not going to find a more user-friendly examination of race in America than Ijeoma Oluo's fantastic new book. The writing is elegantly simple, which is a real feat when tackling such a thorny issue. Think of it as <i>Race for the Willing-to-Listen</i>." <br>―<b>Andy Richter, writer and actor</b></p></div><p><b>Ijeoma Oluo</b> is a writer and speaker whose work on race has been featured in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Elle</i>, <i>The Guardian, </i>and more. She has twice been named to <i>The Root 100 </i>and received the 2018 Feminist Humanist Award from the American Humanist Society. She lives in Seattle.
