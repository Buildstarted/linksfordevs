		<p>In 2019, Now Play This is focusing on a theme of community. We’re looking at games that create a community around them, like Tale of Tales’ <em>Endless Forest</em>; at games made for a small group or even just one person, like Brenda Romero’s <em>Black Box</em>; at games about the experiences of a particular community, like Mountains’ <em>Florence</em> or Abi Palmer’s <em>Crip Casino</em>; and at different game-making communities and the work that comes out of them, like the different contributions to the gallery space of <em>Zium Garden</em> or like <em>sok-stories</em>, a new game-making tool from sokpop made especially for Now Play This.</p>

  <div>
    <p>Home protects us, and home also needs our protection. When it comes to the protection of home, cluster creatures such as bees and ants will take their lives to protect their nests. Since the way the bees communicate is by dancing, Yu Tian decided to make a rhythm game that mimics the life of the colony and the nest.&nbsp;Beat&amp;Nest simulates a swarm of creatures guarding their home. In order to simulate a large number of life moving together with high performance, he used unity's latest ECS technology to highly optimize the performance. Each small life in it is not a particle effect or shader, but an entity with its own life value, mass, speed, friction and so on.</p>
