Over the past few months, leaders from both communities have formed a seed committee to define how the projects can converge. The seed committee has created a technical committee that will actually facilitate project convergence.</p><p id="37fc" data-selectable-paragraph="">What follows are a few overarching goals (and non-goals) regarding the merger:</p><p id="dab5" data-selectable-paragraph="">The technical committee‚Äôs goal is to develop a plan and set up the grounds for the projects and communities behind OpenCensus and OpenTracing to merge, rather than creating a separate project that provides compatibility between them. The idea is to have a plan in place that will maximize compatibility and optimize for an easy (and brief) migration period for existing repositories.</p><p id="5570" data-selectable-paragraph="">The technical committee‚Äôs first priority is to reduce the number of instrumentation standards to one. Part of this tradeoff is resisting the temptation to add net-new features or undertake a larger refactor or redesign which could hinder migrations or backwards-compatibility. After merging the projects and communities, we will be in a better position to enable new features and innovations down the road.</p><p id="aa73" data-selectable-paragraph="">The technical committee will ensure that the most important developer scenarios remain supported and will prioritize end-user benefits and standardization over feature requests from individual tracing/observability projects or vendors. Furthermore, we recognize that the converged project will not necessarily be a complete superset of <em>all</em> features from both projects, though of course essential functionality will be preserved. When backwards-compatibility is in tension with our other objectives here, we will reach out to end-users to help guide our decision-making process.</p><p id="166b" data-selectable-paragraph="">One of the greatest user priorities is the ease of migration. To that end, we will do our best to satisfy the following requirements:</p><ul><li id="f69a" data-selectable-paragraph="">An application using OpenTracing instrumentation today ‚Äújust works‚Äù with the new project</li><li id="2e16" data-selectable-paragraph="">An app using OpenCensus instrumentation today ‚Äújust works‚Äù with the new project</li><li id="555e" data-selectable-paragraph="">A mix of OpenTracing, OpenCensus, and ‚Äúnative‚Äù instrumentation ‚Äújust works‚Äù with the new project</li></ul><p id="63ae" data-selectable-paragraph="">For implementers of the OpenTracing and OpenCensus APIs/SPIs ‚Äî be they vendors or other open-source projects ‚Äî we will create clear guidance for migrations to support the new project natively.</p><p id="b74b" data-selectable-paragraph="">The converged project will be easy to enable and use, and will provide a compelling set of features out of the box. However, there will still be a room for customizations and innovations. While we will prefer built-in customizations, we will design components to be loosely coupled in order to leave room for innovations and forwards-compatibility.</p><p id="3df8" data-selectable-paragraph="">Though the various components will be loosely coupled and consumed separately, the scope of the merged project includes data sources beyond distributed transaction traces. After all, instrumentation and observability involve other data sources, too. So the surface area of merged project APIs will incorporate a variety of signals, like metrics, traces and logs.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
