But opposition is mounting.</p><p>It currently has 15,300 tonnes saved up - that's enough to last the country three months. </p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Why stop this?</h2><p>The government now says coffee is "not essential for life" so doesn't need to be included in the emergency reserves. </p><p><a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-74644.html" class="story-body__link-external">"Coffee contains almost no calories and therefore does not contribute, from the physiological perspective, to safeguarding nutrition,"</a> the Federal Office for National Economic Supply said (in German).</p><hr class="story-body__line"><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">You may also like</h2><hr class="story-body__line"><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Will stockpiling definitely end?</h2><p>The plan has now been released for public comment with a final decision expected in November.</p><p>But not everyone is happy about it. </p><p>Reservesuisse, which oversees Switzerland's food stockpiles, says 12 of 15 companies that stockpile coffee in the country want to continue doing so.</p><p>In a letter seen by Reuters, it says the "weighting of calories as the main criteria for a vital staple did not do justice to coffee".</p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">How much coffee do the Swiss drink?</h2><p>The Swiss are big fans of coffee, consuming about 9kg (20lb) per person per year, according to the International Coffee Organization.</p><p>This is almost triple that consumed in Britain, where 3.3kg per person per year is consumed.</p></div></div></div></div>
