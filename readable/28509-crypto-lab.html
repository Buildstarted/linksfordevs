The purpose of our Startup is to release the most disruptive innovation in cryptography based on the most elegant proof (not yet official in terms of media coverage) of the Riemann Hypothesis, which is considered as the toughest problem in Mathematics and one of the seven Millennium Prize problems endowed by the Clay Mathematics Institute, along with the associated $1 million reward. A major Breakthrough in Sciences has been achieved since our stealth encryption protocol is neither symmetrical nor asymmetrical but fettered with the distribution of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta function. With such small, fast and unbreakable keys we reduce significantly the space and the energy allowed, above all for the Artificial Intelligence, the mobile devices, the Blockchain, the Fintech (+5 trillion operations per day in the financial markets) and the embedded technologies. The complex numbers are the gateway of the quantum fields and we proved that they are infinitely many and there all have real part a half. The actual cryptosystem is cumbersome, expansive and has grazed a ceiling, whilst our protocol offers the best compromise. Also, we have found fatal errors on the commonly used encryption which is 40 years older. Fortunately, we have successfully conducted the test of the new set over +8192 bits and, we will help organizations implement secure and future-proof IoT products that are protected against the potential security threats of exascale supercomputers and quantum computing. We secured our &quot;Hygge&quot; Business Plan with crafty strategies which reduce the cost to the consumer and scale reduces equity investment risk and promises a higher return on investment. Ultimately, we are at a turning point in the history of cryptography and we offer a genuine capital gain.<br>
