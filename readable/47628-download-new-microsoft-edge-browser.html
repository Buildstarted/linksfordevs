Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They apply to this software published
by Microsoft and any software updates (“Software”) (except to the extent such Software
or updates are accompanied by new or </span><span>additional
terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and do not alter
your or Microsoft’s rights relating to pre-updated Software</span><span lang="EN">). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU
HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.</span><span> BY DOWNLOADING OR USING
THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, YOU HAVE NO
RIGHT TO AND MUST NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THE SOFTWARE.&nbsp; </span></p><h3><b><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><b><span>MICROSOFT EDGE FOR WINDOWS DEVICES </span></b></h3><h3><b><span>1.1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><b><span>Windows License Terms</span></b><span>. Your installation and use of the Software on any Windows platform shall be governed by the license terms for your Microsoft Windows Operating System software (“Windows License Terms”) on which you are using the Software, and those terms are incorporated by reference. If the Software is downloaded from Microsoft and labeled preview, insider, beta or pre-release, or is otherwise indicated as not being a final retail version of the Software, the applicable terms in Section 1.2 also apply to your use of the Software. Section 1.3 applies to your use of other services that may be made available for use through your use of the Software.</span></h3><h3><b><span>1.1.1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></b><b><span>Updates</span></b><span>.
Notwithstanding above Section 1.1 as applied to Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, the terms of the applicable Windows License Terms, or any Windows update settings you have configured, the Software periodically checks for updates, and downloads and installs them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources, and Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with those updates. By accepting this agreement, you agree to receive these types of automatic updates without any additional notice.
    </span></h3><h3><b><span>1.2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><b><span>Previews</span></b><span>.
Microsoft may make preview, insider, beta or other pre-release versions of the Software (“Previews”) available to you. You may use Previews only up to the Software’s expiration date (if any) and so long as you comply with the applicable Windows License Terms. Previews are experimental, which means that Previews may not operate correctly and may be substantially different from the commercially released version. In some instances, Previews may even inadvertently damage your device rendering it inoperable or cause occasional crashes, data loss or apps to stop working or be deleted. To recover, you may have to reinstall your apps, the operating system or re-flash your device. In some instances, you may not be able to go back to your prior version of the Software. Because Previews may contain more errors or inaccuracies, you should back-up your device before installing any Previews. We recommend installing Previews on non-production devices that are not business critical because you are more likely to experience crashes, setting and policy changes, loss of data or apps, feature and functionality changes, cause other apps to stop working, be updated, or removed from your device automatically without notice and other potential issues. We highly recommend that you do not install the Previews on any systems you don’t directly control or that you share with others. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, Previews are nontransferable and provided “AS IS.” By installing Previews on your device, you may void or impact your device warranty and may not be entitled to support from the manufacturer of your device or network operator, if applicable. Microsoft may not provide support services for Previews. If you provide Microsoft comments, suggestions or other feedback about the Preview (“Submission”), you grant Microsoft and its partners rights to use the Submission in any way and for any purpose. You will not give a Submission that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its Software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your Submission in them. These rights survive this agreement. Microsoft may change or discontinue the Previews, or terminate your access to the Previews, at any time without notice and for any reason whatsoever. You may stop using the Previews at any time by un-installing and deleting all copies of any Previews.

this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer
protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of
laws principles, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration.
If you acquired the Software in any other country, its laws apply, except that
the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If U.S. federal jurisdiction

province, or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft,
you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the Software.
This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state,
province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired
