<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>So earlier this year <a href="https://www.jeremymorgan.com/blog/linux/pine64-pro-laptop-review/">I reviewed the PineBook Pro</a>. I was pretty impressed with it at the time, but am I still enamored with this $200 laptop? I’ve now been using it for at least 90 days. I know that because I haven’t rebooted it in 90 days. <em>Really.</em></p><p><img src="https://www.jeremymorgan.com/images/90-days-pinebook-pro/90-days-pinebook-pro-01.jpg" alt="90 Days with the PineBook Pro"></p><p>Here is my review of it after using it for three months.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-pinebook-pro">What is the PineBook Pro?</h2><p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/PinebookProSpecs">PineBook Pro</a> has some pretty lofty goals. I like lofty goals, so when I read about it, I ordered one. According to the Pine64 organization:</p><h3 id="a-powerful-metal-and-open-source-arm-64-bit-laptop-for-work-school-or-fun">A Powerful, Metal and Open Source ARM 64-Bit Laptop for Work, School or Fun</h3><blockquote><p><em>The Pinebook Pro is meant to deliver solid day-to-day Linux or BSD experience and to be a compelling alternative to mid-ranged Chromebooks that people convert into Linux laptops. In contrast to most mid-ranged Chromebooks however, the Pinebook Pro comes with an IPS 1080p 14″ LCD panel, a premium magnesium alloy shell, 64/128GB of eMMC storage (more on this later – see asterisk below), a 10,000 mAh capacity battery and the modularity / hackability that only an open source project can deliver – such as the unpopulated PCIe m.2 NVMe slot (an optional feature which requires an optional adapter). The USB-C port on the Pinebook Pro, apart from being able to transmit data and charge the unit, is also capable of digital video output up-to 4K at 60hz.</em></p></blockquote><p>So it’s an open-source alternative to a Chromebook, cheap computing you can hack and tweak. When I first reviewed it, I said:</p><blockquote><p><em>This laptop is better than any $200 laptop should be.</em></p></blockquote><p>Well, that was (at least) 90 days ago. Do I still feel that way?</p><h2 id="how-ive-been-using-the-pinebook-pro">How I’ve Been Using the PineBook Pro</h2><p><img src="https://www.jeremymorgan.com/images/90-days-pinebook-pro/90-days-pinebook-pro-02.jpg" alt="90 Days with the PineBook Pro"></p><p>So, I recently redesigned this entire website that you’re viewing. I converted it from Octopress to Hugo. I started the project on the PineBook laptop one night and decided to use it to finish it out. So I did the entire (200+ article) conversion on that laptop. It did great.</p><p>I also wrote a Go/Hugo powered news section of the site (which I decided not to keep) on this laptop. I wrote a couple of cool Python scrapers with it as well.</p><p>I have written several articles on it since then, including the one you’re reading now.</p><p>I have also used it as a “play” laptop. So when I’m sitting around with the family chilling out, I grab it and browse the internet, read Reddit, HackerNews, etc. It makes a fantastic “fun” laptop for that. I can even hit YouTube and watch videos if I want to.</p><p>I have a couple of Chromebooks too, and they’ve been collecting dust since I got the Pinebook Pro.</p><blockquote><p><em>Is it a Chromebook replacement? Absolutely. It’s a Chromebook upgrade. This is far more powerful and fun than any Chromebook I’ve ever had</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="the-low-points">The Low Points</h2><p>Surely it hasn’t been all peaches and roses, otherwise, I would have put my Thinkpad on eBay by now, right? Well, there are some small downsides to it.</p><ul><li>It doesn’t like Chrome. It’s very easy to open too many things and Chrome slows to a crawl. Is this a PineBook Issue? Well, sort of, but it’s also more of a Chrome issue.</li><li>There are still a few applications that haven’t been ported to ARM. Again not the fault of the PineBook.</li><li>The keyboard takes some getting used to. I’m good with it now, but at first, it seemed too small. I have big hands. I wouldn’t ask them to change the size of the laptop though. Its size and weight are perfect for portability.</li><li>Some of the programming I’ve done is x86 specific - not the fault of the PineBook.</li></ul><h2 id="my-verdict-after-90-days">My Verdict after 90 Days</h2><p>So after ninety days using this, do I still love the PineBook Pro? <strong>Absolutely</strong>. I’ve put this thing through its paces. I haven’t rebooted it for 90 days (though I’ve restarted services as needed), and I’ve used it almost every single day. I grab it and use it to grab statistics, or send an email, build software, etc. I use it a lot. One of the greatest things about this laptop is this:</p><blockquote><p><em>It keeps you from distractions to work on stuff that matters</em></p></blockquote><p>I can’t play video games on this thing. It’s not the best Netflix machine I own. But it’s excellent for doing productive things, which is one of the goals of the project!</p><ul><li>Can I write code on it? Yes, definitely!</li><li>Can I do research with it? All the time!</li><li>Can I write articles with it? Yes!!</li></ul><p>So I can communicate with people, and produce things with this laptop that <strong>costs $200</strong>. I would say the folks behind this project have met their goal.</p><p>If you’re interested in a PineBook Pro, it looks like <a href="http://bit.ly/PinebookProSpecs">they’ll be available in Mid May. Get yours now!</a></p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> I still love this thing, and I think you should get one.</p><br><hr></div></article></div></div></div>
