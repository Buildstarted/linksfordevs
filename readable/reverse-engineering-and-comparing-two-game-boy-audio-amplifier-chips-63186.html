<p>The Nintendo Game Boy contains an audio amplifier chip for sound through a speaker or headphones.
In this post, I reverse-engineer this chip
and compare it with the later
Game Boy Color chip (<a href="http://www.righto.com/2020/05/reverse-engineering-audio-chip-in.html">reverse-engineered earlier</a>).
Unexpectedly the Game Boy Color uses an entirely different amplifier design
from the original Game Boy, which may explain why the two systems
<a href="http://www.herbertweixelbaum.com/comparison.htm">sound different</a>.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the Game Boy amplifier's silicon die, with the main functional components labeled.<span id="fnref:chip"><a href="#fn:chip">1</a></span>
The upper-left part of the chip has the two large driver transistors for the speaker output (one to pull the signal low and the other to pull the signal high).
The headphone amplifier consists of two nearly-identical blocks: one for the left channel and one for the right.
The circuitry for the current sources and current mirrors is shared by both headphone channels.
The lower-left of the chip contains digital logic to enable either the speaker amp or the headphone amp, switching when the headphones are plugged in.</p>

-->

<p>By examining the die closely, components such as transistors and resistors can be identified. From this, the complete circuit can be determined.
In the photo above, the white lines are the chip's metal layer, connecting the components.
The silicon itself appears greenish and is underneath the metal.
The green squares around the outside are the pads where tiny bond wires connected the silicon die to the chip's 18 pins.
Regions of the chip are treated (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_(semiconductor)">doped</a>) to change the electrical properties of the silicon.
The next sections explain how components are created from these different types of silicon.
<!-- N-type silicon has an excess of electrons (negative), while P-type silicon lacks electrons (positive). --></p>
<h3>NPN transistors</h3>
<p>The amplifier chip is built from transistors known as NPN and PNP bipolar transistors, different from
the low-power MOS transistors used in processors.
These transistors have three connections: the emitter, the base, and the collector.
The magnified photo below shows an NPN transistor from above.
The slightly different tints in the silicon indicate regions that have been doped to form N and P regions, with dark lines separating the regions.
The bubbly silverish areas are the metal layer of the chip on top of the silicon—these form the wires connected to the emitter, base, and collector.
<!-- You can spot an emitter on the chip by its "bullseye" structure. --></p>
<p><a href="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/transistor-structure-npn.jpg"><img alt="An NPN transistor in the Game Boy Color amplifier chip.

The collector (C), emitter (E), and base (B) are labeled, along with N and P doped silicon." width="350"></a></p><p>An NPN transistor in the Game Boy Color amplifier chip. The collector (C), emitter (E), and base (B) are labeled, along with N and P doped silicon.</p>
<p>Underneath the photo is a vertical cross-section illustrating how the transistor is constructed.
The emitter (E) wire is connected to N+ silicon. Below that is a P layer connected to the base contact (B). And below that is an N+ layer connected (indirectly) to the collector (C).
If you look at the vertical cross-section below the 'E', you can find the N-P-N layers that form the transistor.</p>
<p>A different structure (below) is used for the high-current output transistors that drive the speaker.
These transistors are much larger and have multiple interlocking "fingers" of the emitter and base, surrounded by the large collector.
If you look back at the die photo, you can see two of these transistors filling the upper left part of the die.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/big-transistor.jpg"><img alt="A large, high-current NPN output transistor in the Game Boy Color audio amplifier chip.

The collector (C), base (B), and emitter (E) are labeled.</p>
<h3>PNP transistors</h3>
<p>The chip also uses PNP transistors, which have an entirely different construction, as shown in the diagram below.
The most obvious difference is that the PNP transistors are round.<span id="fnref:pnp"><a href="#fn:pnp">2</a></span>
A PNP transistor has a small circular emitter (P-silicon), surrounded by a ring-shaped base region (N-silicon), which in turn is surrounded by the collector (P-silicon). (The emitter metal covers both the emitter and the base, but is only connected to the emitter.)
These regions form a P-N-P sandwich horizontally (laterally), unlike the vertical structure of the NPN transistors.
Note that although the base region physically surrounds the emitter, the metal connection to the base is further away;
the base signal passes through the N region underneath the collector to reach the base region.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/transistor-structure-pnp.jpg"><img alt="A PNP transistor in the Game Boy audio amplifier chip.

<h3>Resistors</h3>
<p>Resistors are an important component of analog chips.
The photo below shows some long, zig-zagging resistors, formed from strips of P silicon, which appears beige in the photo.
Its resistance is proportional to the length of the resistor, so large-value resistors have a zig-zag shape to fit in the available space.
Because resistors are relatively large and inaccurate, chip designs try to minimize the number of resistors required. Even so, an analog chip like
this one requires numerous resistors.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/resistors.jpg"><img alt="Some resistors in the Game Boy audio amplifier chip. In the center, two resistors in parallel provide a low resistance. The long, meandering resistors provide high resistance." height="170" src="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/resistors-w350.jpg" title="Some resistors in the Game Boy audio amplifier chip.

In the center, two resistors in parallel provide a low resistance. The long, meandering resistors provide high resistance.</p>
<p>The photo below shows seven small resistors, but only the two in the middle are connected (in parallel) to the circuit.
These extra resistors allow the resistance to be modified by modifying the metal layer, which is much easier than changing the silicon.
(These resistors bias the output transistor, and it appears this is a critical resistance that required adjustment.)</p>
<p><a href="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/unused-resistors.jpg"><img alt="This photo shows seven short resistors but some are not used." height="85" src="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/unused-resistors-w200.jpg" title="This photo shows seven short resistors but some are not used." width="200"></a></p><p>This photo shows seven short resistors but some are not used.</p>
<h3>Capacitors</h3>
<p>This chip has three large capacitors, one for each amplifier.
The photo below shows one of the capacitors.
The capacitors are simply a large layer of metal over the underlying silicon, separated by a thin insulating oxide layer.
At the top and right of the photo, you can see the connections between the metal wiring and the underlying silicon.
In this chip, capacitors are used to ensure the stability of the amplifiers.
Because they are large, the three capacitors are easy to spot in the chip die photo.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/capacitor.jpg"><img alt="A capacitor on the Game Boy audio amplifier chip." height="211" src="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/capacitor-w350.jpg" title="A capacitor on the Game Boy audio amplifier chip." width="350"></a></p><p>A capacitor on the Game Boy audio amplifier chip.</p>
<h2>The LM380</h2>
<p>The Game Boy amplifier chip has a design very similar to the popular LM380 power audio amplifier chip (1972), so I'll start with an overview of how the LM380 works.
(See the footnote<span id="fnref:lm380"><a href="#fn:lm380">5</a></span> for details.)
The LM380 has positive and negative inputs and an output that amplifies the difference between the inputs by a fixed factor of 50.
This may sound like an op-amp, but the LM380 is intended as an audio amplifier and is different from an op-amp in several ways: it has a small, fixed gain, it doesn't have a negative power supply, and its
internal implementation is different.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows the main functional blocks of the LM380.
The inputs go into a differential pair circuit (blue)<span id="fnref:differential-input"><a href="#fn:differential-input">3</a></span>.
The output from the differential pair (green) goes into a single-transistor amplification stage that provides more gain.
The capacitor across the amplification stage stabilizes the amplifier to prevent oscillation.
Finally, the output stage (purple) produces the high-current output: power transistor Q7 pulls the output high, while Q8 and Q9<span id="fnref:szilaki"><a href="#fn:szilaki">4</a></span> pull the output low.
The feedback network controls the gain of the LM380, fixing the gain at a factor of 50.
Note that unlike an op-amp, the LM380's feedback network is connected to internal points of the amplifier, not the inputs.</p>

<h2>Game Boy Audio chip: headphone amplifier</h2>

<p>The Game Boy amplifier chip contains three amplifiers: two identical amplifiers for the left and right headphone channels, and a more powerful mono amplifier for the speaker.
The Game Boy headphone amplifiers and the speaker amplifier are somewhat different, but they are both similar to the LM380.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows the Game Boy headphone amplifier.
Comparing it with the LM380 schematic above shows the similarities between the LM380 and the headphone amplifier, but also some differences.
The input stage and feedback circuit of the LM380 are the most distinctive parts of that chip, and the headphone amplifier's circuit is essentially
identical.<span id="fnref:feedback"><a href="#fn:feedback">6</a></span>
The "Amplification" stage of the headphone amplifier has three transistors compared to one in the LM380, probably to produce more gain.
The headphone amplifier's output stage is similar but simplified; the PNP/NPN pair that pulls the LM380 output low is replaced with a single PNP transistor.
The biggest difference is the "Control" section of the headphone amplifier, which is not present in the LM380.
This control circuitry powers down the headphone amplifier if headphones are not plugged in, conserving battery life.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/gba-labeled.jpg"><img alt="Schematic of the Game Boy headphone amplifier that I created by reverse-engineering the die." height="505" src="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/gba-labeled-w600.jpg" title="Schematic of the Game Boy headphone amplifier that I created by reverse-engineering the die." width="600"></a></p><p>Schematic of the Game Boy headphone amplifier that I created by reverse-engineering the die.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the left headphone amplifier.
The output pin (lower-right, next to the part number SBG14) is driven by seven PNP transistors in parallel (top-left) and seven smaller NPN transistors in parallel (lower center).
The capacitor is in the upper left, near the center. Many resistors snake around the die.</p>

<h2>Game Boy Audio chip: speaker amplifier</h2>
<p>The next schematic shows the Game Boy speaker amplifier. Unlike the two channels for headphone amplification, there is a single speaker amplifier,
producing a mixture of the left and right channels.
Again, the input stage and feedback are almost identical to the LM380. The output stage has only minor differences.
However, the amplification stage for the speaker is completely different: it includes a four-transistor differential amplifier stage, which will provide much more
amplification.<span id="fnref:amplification"><a href="#fn:amplification">7</a></span>
Although this amplification stage looks very similar to the input stage at first glance, its is wired differently and uses NPN transistors.<span id="fnref:differential"><a href="#fn:differential">8</a></span></p>
<p><a href="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/gba-speaker-labeled.jpg"><img alt="Schematic of the speaker amplifier in the Game Boy audio amplifier chip." height="478" src="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/gba-speaker-labeled-w700.jpg" title="Schematic of the speaker amplifier in the Game Boy audio amplifier chip." width="700"></a></p><p>Schematic of the speaker amplifier in the Game Boy audio amplifier chip.</p>
<p>The chip provides pins for bypass capacitors to reduce the effect of power supply fluctuations.<span id="fnref:bypass"><a href="#fn:bypass">9</a></span>
The headphone amplifiers have external bypass capacitors, but the speaker bypass capacitor is omitted for some reason
(see the <a href="https://chipmusic.org/forums/topic/13608/dmg-main-board-schematic-circuit-arduinoboy/">Game Boy schematic</a>).
Lack of this capacitor may contribute to the background hum that <a href="http://www.herbertweixelbaum.com/comparison.htm">people hear</a> in the Game Boy's sound.</p>
<h2>Comparison with the Game Boy Color</h2>
<p>I recently <a href="http://www.righto.com/2020/05/reverse-engineering-audio-chip-in.html">reverse-engineered</a> the Game Boy Color's amplifier chip, so
it's interesting to compare the two chips.
The amplifier chips for the Game Boy and the Game Boy Color provide similar functions.
Even at the die level (below), the two chips look similar.
They both have power transistors in the upper-left for the speaker, control circuitry in the lower-left, and two headphone channels on the right.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/chip-comparison.jpg"><img alt="Comparison of the audio amplifier chip from the Game Boy (left) and Game Boy Color (right). Photos courtesy of John McMaster." height="312" src="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/chip-comparison-w700.jpg" title="Comparison of the audio amplifier chip from the Game Boy (left) and Game Boy Color (right). Photos courtesy of John McMaster." width="700"></a></p><p>Comparison of the audio amplifier chip from the Game Boy (left) and Game Boy Color (right). Photos courtesy of <a href="https://siliconpr0n.org/">John McMaster</a>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the implementations of the two chips are completely different.
While the Game Boy uses LM380-style audio amplifiers, the Game Boy Color uses power op-amps with
more complicated circuitry.
The most important difference is that the Game Boy chip has internal feedback to control the gain, while the
Game Boy Color also has an external feedback capacitor, which causes it to act as a high-pass filter.
For more information, see my <a href="http://www.righto.com/2020/05/reverse-engineering-audio-chip-in.html">Game Boy Color amplifier article</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/shirriff/GBC-audio-chip/blob/master/schematic.pdf">schematic</a>.</p>
<p>Collectors of Game Boy systems have noticed that the different versions have a very different sound
(<a href="http://www.herbertweixelbaum.com/comparison.htm">discussion</a>).
The original Game Boy has a "warm, bassy sound", while the Game Boy Color has a "thin sound" with background noise and hum. 
These aren't just subjective differences, but show up in the waveforms:</p>
<p><a href="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/waveforms.png"><img alt="Graphs courtesy of Herbert Weixelbaum." height="269" src="http://static.righto.com/images/nintendo-dmg-amp/waveforms-w400.png" title="Graphs courtesy of Herbert Weixelbaum." width="400"></a></p>
<p>What's interesting is that we can explain much of the sound difference through the analysis of the amplifier chips.
The Game Boy's output is close to a square wave, but the waveform drops somewhat due to the speaker's 100µF DC blocking capacitor
(<a href="https://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/DMG_Schematics">schematic</a>).
The amplifier in the Game Boy Color, on the other hand, is configured as a high-pass filter, so it outputs higher-frequency spikes, losing the bass sound.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Game Boy (1989) and Game Boy Color (1998) use custom amplifier chips. By examining die photos, the circuitry can be reverse engineered.
The chips are different from common amplifier chips in two main ways, which probably explains why custom chips were created.
First, each chip has three amplifiers: two for headphone channels and one for the speaker. Second, to conserve power the chip has circuitry to power-down
the unused amplifiers, based on whether or not headphones are plugged in.
Reverse-engineering the chips also explains much of the difference in sound between the Game Boy and the Game Boy Color.
The Game Boy Color's chip implements a high-pass filter, so the sound is thin and lacks the bass of the Game Boy.</p>
