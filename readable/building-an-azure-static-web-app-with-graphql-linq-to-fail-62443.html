<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><header></header><section><article><section><p>At Microsoft Build we launched the preview of a new product, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/static/?WT.mc_id=aaronpowell-blog-aapowell">Azure Static Web Apps</a>. This is a product I've been wanting for <strong>years</strong> on Azure as I've done a lot of static websites on Azure (see <a href="https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2018-06-21-cutting-azure-costs/">Cutting Azure Costs for DDD Sydney</a>) but they were always been a bit clunky, especially when it comes to integration with a backend. I have it working for some apps, but there's a lot of infrastructure overhead.</p><p>But now, with Static Web Apps, it's a whole lot easier as it's designed for this by using a combination of static hosting and Azure Functions. We've got some <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/?WT.mc_id=aaronpowell-blog-aapowell">fantastic docs</a> (I wrote the Hugo, Gatsby and VuePress docs ðŸ˜‰) that will get you up and running on all things Static Web Apps.</p><p>It's one thing to read the docs, and another thing to learn how to actually build something, so at Build I decided to put myself to the test and try to build and deploy an app in ~30 minutes. You'll find the video in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY5NYJDP4k0&amp;list=PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco&amp;index=74">Microsoft Build YouTube playlist</a> but what you might notice about it is that it's a lot of copy and pasting of code, and not a lot of actually writing code.</p><p>Well, it's time to really put my money where my mouth is and go about building the application, and to do that I'm going to try out <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/aaron_powell">Twitch</a> and do a live stream of how we can build the app.</p><p>I'm going to kick off at <strong>11.30am (Sydney Time) Friday 5th June</strong>, between now and then I'm going to try and work out how to use Twitch, and we'll see if I can do this without resorting to copy/paste all the time! ðŸ¤£</p><p>So, come join me on Friday and we'll see if we can't build this app!</p></section></article></section></section></div></div>
