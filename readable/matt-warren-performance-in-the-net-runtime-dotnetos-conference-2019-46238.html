Matt is a C# dev who loves nothing more than finding and fixing performance issues. He’s
worked with Azure, ASP.NET MVC and WinForms on projects for storing government weather
data, medical monitoring devices and an inspection system that ensured kegs of beer didn’t leak! He’s previously been an Open Source Contributor to BenchmarkDotNet and RavenDB, nowadays he mostly blogs about the internals of the .NET Runtime at www.mattwarren.org. Matt currently works on the Raygun APM Platform (raygun.com/platform/apm) and lives near
Pinewood Film Studios (home of James Bond) with his wife and 2 kids.

We often take the 'Common Language Runtime' (CLR) for granted and just let it get on with its job. But not only does it run our code, it ensures that it runs as fast as possible. In this talk we'll take a walk through the internals of the .NET Runtime, from a 'performance' perspective. Looking at some of the low-level tricks the .NET Core CLR does to make our code run as fast as possible. Covering Value Types, Method Calls, Tiered Compilation and more.
