            Rocketbirds 2 Evolution - Now available on Steam! - We kept the trailer short, but sweet!

Special thanks go out to Charles Woodson Parker yet again for providing the VO at such short notice! James McCreadie, for Metal Chicken and being such a great guy! Also, thanks go out to Herwig Maurer, the one man army and genius behind New World Revolution, for providing the final audio mix down and an epic score! And Rocketbirds fans for being so goddamn patient with us! Let's launch this puppy already!

Here's the details:

The ‚Äúmost interesting chicken in the world‚Äù is back in his first sequel Rocketbirds 2: Evolution, where Hardboiled Chicken gets entangled in a mysterious and sinister penguin plot in ‚ÄúPart 1: The Cockup‚Äù. Meanwhile, the pint sized budgie commandos are forming a strike force of great magnitude in ‚ÄúPart 2: The Rescue‚Äù, where players need to rescue and recruit hostages from deep behind enemy lines. Both parts can be played in or out of order, but converge to complete the full Evolution story.

Players will engage in nuanced, side-scrolling, shooter action as they face an assortment of evil penguins, space owls and other fowl creatures while strapping on jetpacks and wielding new, powerful weapons of ‚Äòde-clucktion.‚Äô

Key features of Rocketbirds 2: Evolution include:

‚Ä¢ Cinematic platforming, action-adventure game with light puzzle elements and Jetpacks in Part 1: The Cockup 
‚Ä¢ Over 100 upgradeable weapons, costumes and stackable characters to unlock in procedurally generated missions in Part 2: The Rescue
‚Ä¢ Part 2 also features 1 - 4 player online / offline / drop-in / drop-out cooperative features and a PvP mini game
‚Ä¢ Original soundtrack by New World Revolution
