Instead of a script, there was a written breakdown of scenes: “basically, just stage directions for the crew to know who is in it and what they're shooting,” Shearer says. Paul Shaffer, who played Artie Fufkin, the Midwest promotions rep for Spinal Tap's label, recalls that before shooting began, he asked Shearer, “Will I be getting the lines in advance?” Shearer replied, “You'll be making them up, sir.” This lack of dialogue made for bizarre auditions—the members of the band would improvise conversations with the actors trying out for the roles—but the resulting cast was stacked with comedy's rising stars, including Fred Willard, Fran Drescher, Billy Crystal, and Dana Carvey.</p><p>To prepare for the scenes in which Reiner, playing the documentarian Marty DiBergi, interviewed the band members, they assembled an elaborate 17-year history of the group—a bible for each to memorize so they could keep their stories straight. “It was absolutely vital because we didn't know what questions Rob was going to ask,” McKean told <em>The Washington Post</em> the year the movie came out. “But we did know the answers.” The bible included all their past album titles (among them: <em>Intravenus de Milo</em> and <em>The Sun Never Sweats</em>) and other details that would (or would not) emerge in the film, such as the fact that Spinal Tap had once been called the Originals, then the New Originals, and then the Thamesmen.</p><p>What appealed to the foursome was not merely the potential for hilarity but also something not usually associated with spoofs: the chance to get their subject right. They were dead serious about rock 'n' roll, and it bugged them how movies about the music business never seemed to capture the true sights, sounds, and smells of hardworking musicians on the road. “The little touches add up, and that was a lot of the joy in the project,” Guest told the <em>Post</em>. “People out here in Hollywood have a tendency to say nobody will notice, nobody will care, nobody will see that, and our contention was completely the opposite. It got very technical and very bizarre at times, but we had to stick to our guns.”</p><p>The band members were unrelenting in their pursuit of authenticity. One day, they were scheduled to shoot a scene backstage in a club; the stage directions called for “typical backstage graffiti” on the walls. “We walk in,” Shearer says, “and it looks like the art director has visited freeway underpasses near Mexican-gang areas. So we say, ‘No, no. Here is the phone number of the Troubadour,’ ” a famous L.A. club. “ ‘Go to the Troubadour, and go upstairs. We'll wait.’ ” Only when the set was redecorated did the cameras roll.</p><p>The crew included the cinematographer who'd shot <em>Gimme Shelter,</em> a production designer who'd worked with Santana, and a lighting designer who'd collaborated with the band Boston. All the instruments that Shearer, McKean, and Guest played—and, yes, that's them actually playing—were period-appropriate, as were the microphones. U2 guitarist the Edge said that when he first saw <em>Spinal Tap,</em> “I didn't laugh, I wept”—because it captured the ethos of the music business so perfectly.</p><div class="callout callout--group callout--group-2"><figure class="asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-1"><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>The members of Spinal Tap in...</p></span></figcaption></figure><figure class="asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-2"><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>...and out of character in 1984.</p></span><span class="caption__credit">David Corio</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Once all the footage was edited, Guest, McKean, Reiner, and Shearer delivered it to the studio more or less as a finished product. Since then, the film has had more owners than Kiss has had revival tours. After Embassy Pictures, the film was owned for a time by Coca-Cola, then by Dino De Laurentiis, and then, according to Shearer, by a subsidiary of L'Oréal called Parafrance, in response to which the Tap creators formed a company called Parapants. “At that point, our basic mode of attack was just ridicule, because we didn't think there was anything else we could do.” In or around 1989, <em>This Is Spinal Tap</em> was sold to Studiocanal, which was then bought by Vivendi.</p><inline-embed childtypes="" name="dropcap"><p>At a bookstore in New Orleans's Garden District, a fan approaches Shearer. “I saw you 18 years ago, when you showed up as Derek Smalls at the Maple Leaf,” the guy says, but Shearer tells the man he is mistaken. “I can tell you the two times that Derek has been in New Orleans,” he says, ticking off a Sunday morning in 1993, when the band played a merchandising convention at the local Marriott, and then “last year, at one in the morning, one night during Jazz Fest, Derek made an appearance with Snarky Puppy at The Howlin' Wolf. Those are the only two times.”</p></inline-embed><p>Over the years, the band members have reprised their roles on several occasions, and they've kept adding to their characters' backstories. Smalls, for example, has been in therapy for an Internet addiction, has worked as a substitute crossing guard in L.A., and has long been obsessed with trying to breed a black carnation. For the most part, though, everyone is busy with other projects. McKean is a regular on the AMC series <em>Better Call Saul</em>; Guest and Reiner are directing their own films; Shearer is hosting a weekly radio show, doing voices for <em>The Simpsons,</em> developing his own animated series, and working on a memoir. (Will it be a tell-all? I ask. “I'm going to tell some tales, yeah,” he says. “It's not a revenge document, but I'm not going to use whole gallons of varnish, either.”)</p><div class="callout callout--inset-right callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) on set.</p></span><span class="caption__credit">Embassy Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The foursome are cordial, though there have been tensions. In 2014, discussions broke down over a proposed Spinal Tap 30th-anniversary live tour. But in its way, the suit has brought the boys back together. Shearer tells me he alerted everyone to his intention to file through Guest, with whom he maintains the closest ties. After the initial complaint was made public, the band members made statements of support, then discussed joining the action via telephone tree. Shearer says Reiner called him, then Reiner called McKean, and so on. “It was never all of us in a room at the same time,” Shearer says. “Anybody who's been in a band knows that cat herding is easy by comparison.”</p></div></div></div></div>
