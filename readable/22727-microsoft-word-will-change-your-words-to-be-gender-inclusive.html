The US technology giant has included the new feature in its latest version of Word, the popular word processing software.</p><p>It will apply&nbsp;artificial intelligence&nbsp;to recommend users to write in a way that does not discriminate against a particular gender.</p><p>Users of the new <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/11/15/microsoft-office-collects-email-data-breach-gdpr-regulator-rules/">Microsoft Word feature</a>&nbsp;could see suggestions to change “policeman” to “police officer”, for example.</p><p>The software will also use AI to recommend&nbsp; synonyms and ways to shorten sentences to ensure brevity.</p><p>“Writing requires a dash of uniquely human creativity. Artificial intelligence alone cannot do it for us, at least not very well. But AI can – and already is – helping us do things like make sure we spell words correctly and use correct grammar,” the company said in a blogpost.</p><p>"As the AI in these products is becoming more sophisticated, they are helping us do more than spot a misspelled word."</p><p>Microsoft’s rivals have made similar moves after the company first brought its Ideas feature to PowerPoint last year. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/07/google-photos-became-search-giants-secret-ai-weapon/">Google</a> announced in February an AI writing tool to “incorporate the complexity and nuances of grammar correction”.</p><p>A trial version of Ideas will be rolled out in June but will be made available to a wider audience in the autumn. The service will initially be implemented across Word Online, a cloud-based version of the Microsoft product and will ensure users can smooth out clunky sentences and improve readability.</p></div></div></div></div>
