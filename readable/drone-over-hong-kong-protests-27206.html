Despite the widespread demonstrations, the government insisted on the amendment to pass. The second reading was originally scheduled on 12 June but was not held due to protests, and a scheduled meeting on the next day, 13 June, was also postponed. On June 15 the bill was postponed until further notice. A new protest has been scheduled for June 16 to get the bill completely withdrawn.&#xA;__________&#xA;&#x25BA; http://team-blacksheep.com&#xA;&#x25BA; http://facebook.com/teamblacksheep&#xA;&#x25BA; http://plus.google.com/&#x2B;nastycop420&#xA;&#x25BA; http://twitter.com/BlackSheepFPV&#xA;&#x25BA; http://instagram.com/blacksheepfpv&#xA;&#xA;SUBSCRIBE &#x25BA; http://bit.ly/TBSsubscribeYT&#xA;JOIN THE LOUNGE &#x25BA; http://bit.ly/TBSlounge&#xA;__________&#xA;ADDITIONAL VIDEO AND AUDIO BY&#xA;&#x25CF; Mark Delecate&#xA;__________&#xA;FLYING BY&#xA;[tiny 3"/>

            The 2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition law protests are a series of demonstrations in Hong Kong demanding the withdrawal of highly controversial bill proposed by the HK Government. The amended law would permit extradition of criminal suspects to Mainland China and subject them to possible arbitrary detention, unfair trial and torture under China’s judicial system.

The June 9 protest organised by the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) was attended by an estimated 1.03 million people. Despite the widespread demonstrations, the government insisted on the amendment to pass.
