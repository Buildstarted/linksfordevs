<p>In this post I provide an overview of the new endpoint routing system, and show how you can use it to create "endpoints" that run in response to a given request URL path. I show how to take a terminal middleware used in ASP.NET Core 2.x, and convert it to the new ASP.NET Core 3.0 approach.</p>
<h2 id="the-evolution-of-routing">The evolution of routing<a href="#the-evolution-of-routing"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-3.0"><em>Routing</em> in ASP.NET Core</a> is the process of mapping a request URL path such as <code>/Orders/1</code> to some handler that generates a response. This is primarily used with the MVC middleware for mapping requests to controllers and actions, but it is used in other areas too. It also includes functionality for the reverse process: generating URLs that will invoke a specific handler with a given set of parameters.</p>
<p>In ASP.NET Core 2.1 and below, routing was handled by implementing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.routing.irouter">the <code>IRouter</code> interface</a> to map incoming URLs to handlers. Rather than implementing the interface directly, you would typically rely on the <code>MvcMiddleware</code> implementation added to the end of your middleware pipeline. Once a request reached the <code>MvcMiddleware</code>, routing was applied to determine which controller and action the incoming request URL path corresponded to. </p>
<p>The request then went through various <a href="https://andrewlock.net/asp-net-core-in-action-filters/">MVC filters</a> before executing the handler. These filters formed another "pipeline", reminiscent of the middleware pipeline, and in some cases had to duplicate the behaviour of certain middleware. The canonical example of this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors?view=aspnetcore-2.2">is CORS policies</a>. In order to enforce different CORS policies per MVC action, as well as other "branches" of your middleware pipeline, a certain amount of duplication was required internally. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The MVC filter pipeline is so similar to the middleware pipeline you've been able to <a href="https://andrewlock.net/tag/middleware-as-filters/">use middleware as filters</a> since ASP.NET Core 1.1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Branching" the middleware pipeline was often used for "pseudo-routing". Using <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/v2.1.12/src/Http/Http.Abstractions/src/Extensions/MapExtensions.cs">extension methods like <code>Map()</code></a> in your middleware pipeline, would allow you to conditionally execute some middleware when the incoming path had a given prefix. </p>
<p>For example, the following <code>Configure()</code> method from a <em>Startup.cs</em> class branches the pipeline so that when the incoming path is <code>/ping</code>, the terminal middleware executes (written inline using <code>Run()</code>):</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Configure</span><span>(</span><span>IApplicationBuilder</span> app<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    app<span>.</span><span>UseStaticFiles</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseCors</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>Map</span><span>(</span><span>"/ping"</span><span>,</span> 
        app2 <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> app2<span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> context <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>await</span> context<span>.</span>Response<span>.</span><span>WriteAsync</span><span>(</span><span>"Pong"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseMvcWithDefaultRoute</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the <code>Run()</code> method is a "terminal" middleware, because it returns a response. But in a sense, the whole <code>Map</code> branch corresponds to an "endpoint" of the application, especially as we're not doing anything else in the <code>app2</code> branch of the pipeline.</p>

</picture>
<p>The problem is that this "endpoint" is a bit of a second-class citizen when compared to the endpoints in the <code>MvcMiddleware</code> (i.e. controller actions). Extracting values from the incoming route are a pain and you have to manually implement any authorization requirements yourself. </p>
<p>Another problem is that there's no way to know which branch will be run until you're already on it. For example, when the request reaches the <code>UseCors()</code> middleware from the above example it would be useful to know which branch/endpoint is going to be executed - maybe the <code>/ping</code> endpoint allows cross-origin requests, while the MVC middleware doesn't.</p>
<p>In ASP.NET Core 2.2, Microsoft introduced the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-3.0">endpoint routing</a> as the new routing mechanism for MVC controllers. This implementation was essentially internal to the <code>MvcMiddleware</code>, so on the face of it, it wouldn't solve the issues described above. However, the intention was always to trial the implementation there and to expand it to be the primary routing mechanism in ASP.NET Core 3.0.</p>
<p>And that's what we have now. Endpoint routing separates the <em>routing</em> of a request (selecting which handler to run) from the actual <em>execution</em> of the handler. This means you can know ahead of time which handler <em>will</em> execute, and your middleware can react accordingly. This is aided by the new ability to attach extra metadata to your endpoints, such as authorization requirements or CORS policies.</p>

</picture>
<p>So the question is, how should you map the ping-pong pipeline shown previously to the new endpoint-routing style? Luckily, there's not many steps.</p>
<h2 id="a-concrete-middleware-using-map-in-asp-net-core-2-x">A concrete middleware using Map() in ASP.NET Core 2.x<a href="#a-concrete-middleware-using-map-in-asp-net-core-2-x"></a></h2>
<p>To make things a little more concrete, lets imaging you have a custom middleware that returns <a href="https://andrewlock.net/version-vs-versionsuffix-vs-packageversion-what-do-they-all-mean/#fileversion">the <code>FileVersion</code> of your application</a>. This is a very basic <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/write?view=aspnetcore-2.2">custom middleware</a> that is a "terminal" middleware – i.e. it always writes a response and doesn't invoke the <code>_next</code> delegate.</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>VersionMiddleware</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>readonly</span> <span>RequestDelegate</span> _next<span>;</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>Assembly</span> _entryAssembly <span>=</span> System<span>.</span>Reflection<span>.</span>Assembly<span>.</span><span>GetEntryAssembly</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>VersionMiddleware</span><span>(</span><span>RequestDelegate</span> next<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        _next <span>=</span> next<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> <span>Task</span> <span>Invoke</span><span>(</span><span>HttpContext</span> context<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        context<span>.</span>Response<span>.</span>StatusCode <span>=</span> <span>200</span><span>;</span>
        <span>await</span> context<span>.</span>Response<span>.</span><span>WriteAsync</span><span>(</span>_version<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In ASP.NET Core 2.x, you might include this in your middleware pipeline in <em>Startup.cs</em> by using the <code>Map()</code> extension method to choose the URL to expose the middleware at:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Configure</span><span>(</span><span>IApplicationBuilder</span> app<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    app<span>.</span><span>UseStaticFiles</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseCors</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>Map</span><span>(</span><span>"/version"</span><span>,</span> versionApp <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> versionApp<span>.</span><span><span>UseMiddleware</span><span>&lt;</span><span>VersionMiddleware</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 

    app<span>.</span><span>UseMvcWithDefaultRoute</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When you call the app with the a path prefixed with <code>/version</code> (e.g. <code>/version</code> or <code>/version/test</code>) you'll always get the same response, the version of the app:</p>
<pre><code>1.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>When you send a request with any other path (that is not handled by static files), the <code>MvcMiddleware</code> will be invoked, and will handle the request. But with this configuration the CORS middleware (added using <code>UseCors()</code>) can't know which endpoint will ultimately be executed.</p>
<h2 id="converting-the-middleware-to-endpoint-routing">Converting the middleware to endpoint routing<a href="#converting-the-middleware-to-endpoint-routing"></a></h2>
<p>In ASP.NET Core 3.0, we use endpoint routing, so the <em>routing</em> step is separate from the invocation of the endpoint. In practical terms that means we have two pieces of middleware:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>EndpointRoutingMiddleware</code> that does the actual routing i.e. calculating which endpoint will be invoked for a given request URL path.</li>
<li><code>EndpointMiddleware</code> that <em>invokes</em> the endpoint. </li>
</ul>
<p>These are added at two distinct points in the middleware pipeline, as they serve two distinct roles. Generally speaking, you want the routing middleware to be <em>early</em> in the pipeline, so that subsequent middleware has access to the information about the endpoint that will be executed. The invocation of the endpoint should happen at the <em>end</em> of the pipeline. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Configure</span><span>(</span><span>IApplicationBuilder</span> app<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    app<span>.</span><span>UseStaticFiles</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    app<span>.</span><span>UseRouting</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    app<span>.</span><span>UseCors</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    app<span>.</span><span>UseEndpoints</span><span>(</span>endpoints <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapDefaultControllerRoute</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/e7016bc67ab9195db5741d03a03c754891919f7d/src/Http/Routing/src/Builder/EndpointRoutingApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs#L35">The <code>UseRouting()</code> extension method</a> adds the <code>EndpointRoutingMiddleware</code> to the pipeline, while <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/e7016bc67ab9195db5741d03a03c754891919f7d/src/Http/Routing/src/Builder/EndpointRoutingApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs#L73">the <code>UseEndpoints()</code> extension method</a> adds the <code>EndpointMiddleware</code> to the pipeline. <code>UseEndpoints()</code> is also where you actually register all the endpoints for your application (in the example above, we register our MVC controllers only).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: As in the example above, it is generally best practice to place the static files middleware <em>before</em> the Routing middleware. This avoids the overhead of routing when requesting static files. It's also important you place Authentication and Authorization controllers between the two routing middleware <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30?view=aspnetcore-3.0&amp;tabs=visual-studio#migrate-startupconfigure">as described in the migration document</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how do we map our <code>VersionMiddleware</code> using endpoint routing? </p>
<p>Conceptually, we move our registration of the "version" endpoint into the <code>UseEndpoints()</code> call, using the <code>/version</code> URL as the path to match:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Configure</span><span>(</span><span>IApplicationBuilder</span> app<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    app<span>.</span><span>UseStaticFiles</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseRouting</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseCors</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseEndpoints</span><span>(</span>endpoints <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        endpoints<span>.</span><span>Map</span><span>(</span><span>"/version"</span><span>,</span> endpoints<span>.</span><span>CreateApplicationBuilder</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
            <span>.</span><span><span>UseMiddleware</span><span>&lt;</span><span>VersionMiddleware</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
            <span>.</span><span>Build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
            <span>.</span><span>WithDisplayName</span><span>(</span><span>"Version number"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapDefaultControllerRoute</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>There's a few things to note, which I'll discuss below.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are building a <code>RequestDelegate</code> using the <code>IApplicationBuilder()</code></li>
<li>We no longer match based on a route <em>prefix</em>, but on the complete route</li>
<li>You can set an informational name for the endpoint ("Version number")</li>
<li>You can attach additional metadata to the endpoint (not shown in the example above)</li>
</ul>
<p>The syntax for adding the middleware as an endpoint is rather more verbose than the previous version in 2.x. The <code>Map</code> method here requires a <code>RequestDelegate</code> instead of an <code>Action&lt;IApplicationBuilder&gt;</code>. The downside to this is that visually it's much harder to see what's going on. You can work around this pretty easily by creating a small extension method:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>VersionEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>IEndpointConventionBuilder</span> <span>MapVersion</span><span>(</span><span>this</span> <span>IEndpointRouteBuilder</span> endpoints<span>,</span> <span>string</span> pattern<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> pipeline <span>=</span> endpoints<span>.</span><span>CreateApplicationBuilder</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
            <span>.</span><span><span>UseMiddleware</span><span>&lt;</span><span>VersionMiddleware</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
            <span>.</span><span>Build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>return</span> endpoints<span>.</span><span>Map</span><span>(</span>pattern<span>,</span> pipeline<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>WithDisplayName</span><span>(</span><span>"Version number"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>With this extension, <code>Configure()</code> looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Configure</span><span>(</span><span>IApplicationBuilder</span> app<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    app<span>.</span><span>UseStaticFiles</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseRouting</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseCors</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    app<span>.</span><span>UseEndpoints</span><span>(</span>endpoints <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapVersion</span><span>(</span><span>"/version"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapDefaultControllerRoute</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The difference in behaviour with regard to routing is an important one. In our previous implementation for ASP.NET Core 2.x, our version middleware branch would execute for any requests that have a <code>/version</code> segment <em>prefix</em>. So we would match <code>/version</code>, <code>/version/123</code>, <code>/version/test/oops</code> etc. With endpoint routing, we're not specifying a <em>prefix</em> for the URL, we're specifying the whole <em>pattern</em>. That means you can have route parameters in all of your endpoint routes. For example:</p>
<pre><code>endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapVersion</span><span>(</span><span>"/version/{id:int?}"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This would match both <code>/version</code> and <code>/version/123</code> URLs, but not <code>/version/test/oops</code>. This is far more powerful than the previous version, but you need to be aware of it.</p>
<p>Another feature of endpoints is the ability to attach metadata to them. In the previous example we provided a display name (primarily for debugging purposes), but you can attach more interesting information like authorization policies or CORS policies, which other middleware can interrogate. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Configure</span><span>(</span><span>IApplicationBuilder</span> app<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    app<span>.</span><span>UseStaticFiles</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseRouting</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseCors</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    app<span>.</span><span>UseAuthentication</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    app<span>.</span><span>UseAuthorization</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    app<span>.</span><span>UseEndpoints</span><span>(</span>endpoints <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapVersion</span><span>(</span><span>"/version"</span><span>)</span>
            <span>.</span><span>RequireCors</span><span>(</span><span>"AllowAllHosts"</span><span>)</span>
            <span>.</span><span>RequireAuthorization</span><span>(</span><span>"AdminOnly"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        endpoints<span>.</span><span>MapDefaultControllerRoute</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In this example we've added a CORS policy (<code>AllowAllHosts</code>) and an authorization policy (<code>AdminOnly</code>) to the version endpoint. When a request to the endpoint arrives, the routing middleware selects the version endpoint, and makes its metadata available for subsequent middleware in the pipeline. The authorization and CORS middleware can see that there are associated policies and act accordingly, <em>before</em> the endpoint is executed.</p>
<h3 id="do-i-have-to-convert-my-middleware-to-endpoint-routing-">Do I have to convert my middleware to endpoint routing?<a href="#do-i-have-to-convert-my-middleware-to-endpoint-routing-"></a></h3>
<p>No. The whole concept of the middleware pipeline hasn't changed, and you can still branch or early-return from middleware exactly as you have been able to since ASP.NET Core 1.0. Endpoint routing doesn't have to replace your current approaches, and in some cases it shouldn't. </p>
<p>There's three main benefits to endpoint routing that I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can attach metadata to endpoints so intermediate middleware (e.g. Authorization, CORS) can know what will be eventually executed</li>
<li>You can use routing templates in your non-MVC endpoints, so you get route-token parsing features that were previously limited to MVC</li>
<li>You can more easily generate URLs to non-MVC endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>If these features are useful to you, then endpoint routing is a good fit. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-3.0">ASP.NET Core HealthCheck feature</a> was converted to endpoint routing for example, which allows you to add authorization requirements to the health check.</p>
<p>However if these features <em>aren't</em> useful to you, there's no reason you have to convert to endpoint routing. For example, even though the static file middleware is "terminal" in the sense that it often returns a response, it <em>hasn't</em> been converted to endpoint routing. That's because you generally don't need to apply authorization or CORS to static files, so there would be no benefit (and a performance hit) to doing so. </p>
<p>On top of that you should generally place the static file middleware <em>before</em> the routing middleware. That ensures the routing middleware doesn't try and "choose" an endpoint for every request: it would ultimately be wrong anyway for static file paths, as the static file middleware would return before the endpoint is executed!</p>
<p>Overall, endpoint routing adds a lot of features to the previous routing approach but you need to be aware of the differences when upgrading. If you haven't already, be sure to check out <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30">the migration guide</a> which details many of these changes.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary"></a></h2>
<p>In this post I gave an overview of routing in ASP.NET Core and how it's evolved. In particular, I discussed some of the advantages endpoint routing brings, in terms of separating the <em>routing</em> of a request from the <em>execution</em> of a handler. </p>
<p>I also showed of the changes required to convert a simple terminal middleware used in an ASP.NET Core 2.x app to act as an endpoint in ASP.NET Core 3.0. Generally speaking the changes required should be relatively minimal, but it's important to be aware of the change from "prefix-based routing" to the more fully-featured routing approach.</p>
