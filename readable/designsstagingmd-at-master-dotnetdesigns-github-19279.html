<p>Publishing apps as a single file is a popular feature-request in .Net Core. Ideally, we want a single-file solution that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is compatible with all .Net Core applications</li>
<li>Bundles MSIL, R2R, native code and custom (data) files</li>
<li>Doesn't require installation or cleanup steps</li>
<li>Runs directly from the bundle, without extracting components to disk</li>
<li>Reduces publish-size</li>
<li>Improves startup cost</li>
<li>Works cohesively with debuggers, profilers, Watson dump etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This document explores a few options to realize the single-file publish feature, with different feature-set vs development cost trade-offs. The document can also be considered a development staging plan, where each stage spills fewer items onto temporary files, while paying an incremental development cost.</p>
<h2>1. Self-Extractor</h2>
<p>The first stage is to develop a pack and extract tool.
While this stage is technically simplistic, the interface and tooling will match the final solution, giving partner teams and potential customers a chance to prepare for adopting the technology.</p>
<h3>1.1 Description</h3>
<p>This stage implements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A  packaging tool (bundler) that embeds the application and all of its dependencies (essentially the contents of the publish directory) into a host executable.
<ul>
<li>This version will not support compression of the bundled assemblies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the executable runs, it will extract all of those files into a temporary directory, and then run as though the app was published to that temporary directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mechanism will support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reuse: Extract on first-run, reuse on subsequent runs (if apps choose to do so).</li>
<li>Upgrade: Each version of the app extracts to a unique location, supporting side-by-side use of multiple versions.</li>
<li>Uninstall: Users can identify and delete extracted files when the app is no longer needed.</li>
<li>Access control: Processes running with elevated access can extract to admin-only-writable locations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.2 Scenarios</h3>
<p>Best suited for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environments requiring maximal compatibility -- need to embed different kinds of files (IL, native, etc) into one, without losing functionality such as debuggability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unsuitable for environments that require that the app does not perform disk-writes at startup</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low cost of development</li>
<li>Bundler tool can be used as-is for most further stages</li>
<li>Provides ability to develop test infrastructure and prototypes</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Run from Bundle: MSIL</h2>
<h3>2.1 Description</h3>
<p>This stage improves on Stage 1 in that</p>
<ul>
<li>MSIL files bundled into the single-file will load and execute directly from the executable.</li>
<li>Native libraries will still need to
<ul>
<li>Remain in the publish directory unmerged, or</li>
<li>Extracted to the disk like the previous self-extractor stage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Debugging support is unaffected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.2 Scenarios</h3>
<p>Best suited for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Framework dependent purely managed apps that are not ready-to-run compiled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unsuitable for environments that
<ul>
<li>Have native dependencies (ex: published <code>--self-contained</code>, or depend on custom native libraries), and</li>
<li>Cannot tolerate native libraries to remain unbundled or extracted to disk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The app may need to be aware that its dependencies will be embedded into the single-file, when using certain LoadLibrary APIs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Run from Bundle:  R2R</h2>
<h3>3.1 Description</h3>
<p>In this stage</p>
<ul>
<li>MSIL and Ready-to-run files bundled into the single-file will load and execute directly from the executable.</li>
<li>Native library support is the same as the previous stage.</li>
<li>Debugging support is unaffected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.2 Scenarios</h3>
<p>Best suited for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Framework dependent managed apps that may be ready-to-run compiled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unsuitable for environments that have native dependencies that must be bundled and cannot be extracted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Run from Bundle: .Net Core libraries</h2>
<h3>4.1 Description</h3>
<p>In this stage</p>
<ul>
<li>.Net Core native libraries are statically linked to the single-file host executable.</li>
<li>Handling of custom native libraries is the same as the previous stage.</li>
<li>A large portion of the work involved in this stage is to make debuggers and tools compatible with the statically linked runtime.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.2 Scenarios</h3>
<p>Best suited for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-contained managed apps</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environments that have dependencies on custom native libries that must be bundled and cannot be extracted.</li>
<li>Watson dumps may not be supported.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Run from Bundle: Native libraries</h2>
<h3>5.1 Description</h3>
<p>This stage improves on the previous one by providing the ability to statically link custom native code along into the host executable. This involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing the runtime as a library.</li>
<li>Provide tools and guidance to statically link user's native-code with the runtime library to obtain a custom host executable</li>
<li>Tooling to embed managed dependencies into this custom executable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Debugging support is the same as the previous stage.</p>
<p>For native library dependencies, there are two possible scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>On systems where it's not possible to load them from memory, they'll have to be spilled out to disk, and loaded as usual with the standard method of loading shared libraries.</li>
<li>On Linux systems, it's possible to use <code>memfd_create()</code> to create an ephemeral file that's backed by an anonymous memory mapping.  If one writes the bundled shared library into that file and pass the ephemeral path (<code>/proc/self/fd/${FILE_DESCRIPTOR}</code>) to <code>dlopen()</code>, the file library should open as usual.  (Seals may be added with <code>fnctl()</code> for good measure.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>5.2 Scenarios</h3>
<p>Best suited for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-contained managed apps with custom native dependencies (that can be linked).</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watson dumps may not be supported.</li>
</ul>
