<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
      <p>Recently, while teaching my first-ever workshop for <a href="https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-zio">ZIO</a> with the great crew at <a href="https://scalac.io/">Scalac</a>, we had a chance to build a purely functional circuit breaker using ZIO’s <code>Ref</code>, which is a model of a mutable reference that can be updated atomically.</p>

<p>A circuit breaker guards access to an external service, like a database, third-party API or microservice. Once too many requests to the service fail, the circuit breaker trips, and immediately fails all requests, until the circuit breaker has a chance to reset.</p>

<p>Circuit breakers not only protect external services from overload (giving them a chance to recover after failure), but they help conserve local resources (such as sockets, threads, and the like) that would otherwise be wasted on a lost cost.</p>

<p>As opposed to retry policies, which dictate how individual requests are retried, circuit breakers share global knowledge across a system, so different fibers can act more intelligently and in a coordinated fashion.</p>

<p>Circuit breakers are often modeled as having three states: open, closed, and half-open. The circuit breaker logic (possibly aided by configuration parameters) is responsible for transitioning between the states based on inspecting the status of requests.</p>

<p>At the ZIO workshop, exploring different possibilities for circuit breakers made me realize something: I <em>really</em> don’t like circuit breakers. I find the arbitrary nature of the number of states and the switching conditions deeply disturbing.</p>

<p>I think we can do better than circuit breakers, and have some fun while we’re at it! So in this post, I’m going to issue a challenge for all you fans of functional programming in Scala: build a better circuit breaker!</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

<p>Instead of a circuit breaker, I want you to build a <em>tap</em>, which adjusts the flow of requests continuously through the tap.</p>

<p>The flow is adjusted based on observed failures that qualify (i.e. match some user-defined predicate).</p>

<p>If you want to use ZIO to implement the <code>Tap</code>, then your API should conform to the following interface:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>/**
 * A `Tap` adjusts the flow of tasks through 
 * an external service in response to observed
 * failures in the service, always trying to 
 * maximize flow while attempting to meet the 
 * user-defined upper bound on failures.
 */</span>
<span>trait</span> <span>Tap</span><span>[</span><span>-E1</span>, <span>+E2</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/**
   * Sends the task through the tap. The 
   * returned task may fail immediately with a
   * default error depending on the service 
   * being guarded by the tap.
   */</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>apply</span><span>[</span><span>R</span>, <span>E</span> <span>&gt;:</span> <span>E2</span> <span>&lt;:</span> <span>E1</span>, <span>A</span><span>](</span>
    <span>effect</span><span>:</span> <span>ZIO</span><span>[</span><span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>ZIO</span><span>[</span><span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>object</span> <span>Tap</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/**
   * Creates a tap that aims for the specified 
   * maximum error rate, using the specified 
   * function to qualify errors (unqualified 
   * errors are not treated as failures for 
   * purposes of the tap), and the specified 
   * default error used for rejecting tasks
   * submitted to the tap.
   */</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>make</span><span>[</span><span>E1</span>, <span>E2</span><span>](</span>
    <span>errBound</span>  <span>:</span> <span>Percentage</span><span>,</span>
    <span>qualified</span> <span>:</span> <span>E1</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Boolean</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>rejected</span>  <span>:</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>E2</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>UIO</span><span>[</span><span>Tap</span><span>[</span><span>E1</span>, <span>E2</span><span>]]</span> <span>=</span> <span>???</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you want to use Cats IO or Monix to implement <code>Tap</code>, then your API should conform to the following interface (or its polymorphic equivalent):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>trait</span> <span>Tap</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>apply</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>](</span><span>effect</span><span>:</span> <span>Task</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>Task</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>object</span> <span>Tap</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span>
    <span>errBound</span>  <span>:</span> <span>Percentage</span><span>,</span>
    <span>qualified</span> <span>:</span> <span>Throwable</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Boolean</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>rejected</span>  <span>:</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Throwable</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Task</span><span>[</span><span>Tap</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>???</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Your implementation of <code>Tap</code> should satisfy the following requirement:</p>

<p><em>The tap must continuously adjust the percentage of tasks it lets through until it finds the maximum flow rate that satisfies the user-defined maximum error bound.</em></p>

<p>Thus, if you create a tap with a maximum error rate of <em>1%</em>, and suddenly 50% of all tasks are failing, then the tap will decrease flow until the failure rate stabilizes at 1%.</p>

<p>As the service is recovering, the failure rate will drop below 1%, which will cause the tap to increase flow and let more tasks through.</p>

<p>Once the service has fully recovered, the failure rate will hit 0% (or within some distance of that target), at which point, the tap will let all tasks through.</p>

<p>Your implementation must be purely functional and concurrent. Bonus points for demonstrating your knowledge of concurrency primitives, such as <code>Ref</code>, <code>Promise</code> (<code>Deferred</code>), and so forth.</p>

<h2 id="winners">Winners</h2>

<p>The main reason to work on this challenge is to explore solutions for concurrency in functional Scala. It’s a fun little project that will take you on a grand tour of modern, purely functional effect systems in Scala.</p>

<p>That said, I want to give you a little extra motivation to work on this problem!</p>

<p>If you post your code in a Gist so the whole world can learn from your solution, then I’ll both promote your solution, and buy you a drink next time we’re in the same city!</p>

<p>Finally, if your solution is among the top 1-3 I receive over the next 2 weeks, I’ll connect with you on LinkedIn and write a short, honest endorsement of your skills in functional Scala.</p>

<p>Ready? On your marks, get set, go!</p>
