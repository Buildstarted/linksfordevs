<p><span>Greetings, traveller! </span></p>
<p>If you have played a computer role-playing game (CRPG), chances are Ultima played a part in its inspiration. Created by visionary Richard Garriott, and produced by his company Origin Systems, Inc., Ultima is one of the most important and influential CRPG series in the world. <i>Through the Moongate</i>&nbsp;illuminates the path of the Ultima games' history and the creative people behind this landmark series. It also covers some of Origin's other games, especially Wing Commander, and touches on several contemporary titles. Many of these tales have never before been told.</p>
<p><span>Are you ready to step... Through the Moongate?</span></p>

<p>My name is Andrea Contato, the author of <i>Through the Moongate</i>. While Ultima was born at the dawn of the computer role-playing game genre, my first encounter with it was quite late: in 1994 in fact, thirteen years after its first official release. As an avid video game player and having played Wing Commander,&nbsp;Origin Systems Inc. was not new to me, but Ultima was.</p><div contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="It's me, holding my book" data-caption="It's me, holding my book" data-id="22504100">

<p>As I began to delve into the history of Origin Systems Inc. and its co-founder Richard Garriott, I realized how closely intertwined it was with the genre of role-playing games in general. The careers of many of the most influential people in the industry of video games and computing were inspired by Richard, Origin Systems, and Ultima, and I took it upon myself to learn all that I could.</p><p><span>It is a story that deserves to be told.</span></p><p><i>Through the Moongate</i> aims to be a more complete account of Origin's history than has ever been presented before. Parts of Origin's and Richard Garriott's story have been included in other works such as<i> The Official Book of Ultima</i> by Shay Addams and Garriott's own memoir <i>Explore/Create</i>, but this book is a work of new research. In the process I've interviewed dozens of people who were crucial to Origin's success, many of whom have worked for Origin, NCSoft, and Portalarium, and given them a voice. These developers and artists have helped to shed new light on Origin's fascinating story.</p><p>As I traced the paths of the Ultima games and those who worked for Origin Systems, I began to realize the multitude of games that would not be possible without the influence of Richard Garriott, Origin Systems, and Ultima series upon the industry. To ensure their place in history, I've included special coverage of the Wing Commander and Ultima Underworld series, plus significant CRPGs and videogames of the era such as Star Trek (PDP), Empire and other PLATO games, Escape! and RobotWar by Silas Warner, Temple of Apshai, Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord, Wizardry II: The Knight of Diamonds, Escape from Mt. Drash, Moebius: The Orb of Celestial Harmony, Autoduel, Ogre, 2400 A.D., Questron, Tales of the Unknown: Volume I, Wizadore, Dungeon Master, Times of Lore, The Black Onyx, Dragon Quest, and Xanadu.</p><div contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="Through the Moongate is in good company" data-caption="Through the Moongate is in good company" data-id="22478322">

<p>Writing this book was an exciting and unforgettable experience with a lot of ups and downs. It was always wonderful when I found someone to interview and learn an important bit of information. Sometimes, despite my best efforts, I wasn't able to track down a key member of Origin Systems Inc. or a friend of Richard Garriott for an interview. Fortunately, through the generosity of those I could contact, I was able to fill in the gaps in nearly all cases.</p><div contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="Enrico Ricciardi and Richard Garriott with Through the Moongate mockup" data-caption="Enrico Ricciardi and Richard Garriott with Through the Moongate mockup" data-id="22478802">

<p>It's been a long road from writing and researching to publishing this volume. I wouldn't have&nbsp;been able to organize the translation and editing without Andreas Przygienda and Ellouise McGeachie.&nbsp;Enrico Ricciardi&nbsp;provided indispensable help in printing the books and making the video and the trailer. Enrico was also instrumental to putting me in contact with Richard Garriott and Denis Loubet and gaining their direct involvement in the project.&nbsp;Enrico also created the art cover of the book (with the help of Ramon Cipressi for the 3D rendering).</p>

<p>This first of two volumes will be published in three different editions:</p><ul>
<li>Digital edition: Epub and Kindle. <span>English and Italian version available.</span></li>
<li>Softcover edition: 6x9" (15x23cm), approx. 250 pages, black-and-white. <span>English and Italian version available.</span></li>
<li>Hardcover edition: 6.5x9.4" (16.5x24cm), approximately 240 black-and-white pages, plus 16 coated pages of color images and pictures from Richard Garriott's personal archive and Enrico Ricciardi's collection of Ultima games. The retro cover will feature unpublished artwork by the legendary Origin artist Denis Loubet. Each copy of the hardcover edition will be accompanied by Origin artist Manda's bookmark. <span>Only&nbsp;English version available.</span>
</li>
</ul><p>You can find the complete index for both volumes&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theira.it/through-the-moongate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and more information on the project.</p><p>Do you like Manda's artworks? I don't - I LOVE THEM. Manda is a gifted artist and an incredibly kind person. She helped with the writing of this book with lots of recollections told in an interesting and entertaining way. On top of that, she agreed to help us by designing a special (and awesome) bookmark in her unique Ultima style.&nbsp;</p><div contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="Manda's bookmark" data-caption="Manda's bookmark" data-id="22769253">

<p>One of the many things that made Ultima unique and unforgettable was the special certificate you could obtain when you completed a game. We'll have one too! His Majesty Lord British (Richard Garriott) has agreed to hand-sign some unique, custom certificates&nbsp;to help us with this project. They are numbered and printed on premium quality "Turtle Pergamen" parchment paper. There will only be 100 made, so don't wait - when we run out, that's all there will be!</p>

<p>We worked hard to create backer tiers for everyone. With just 15 € you can have your copy of <i>Through the Moongate</i> digital edition (Epub or Kindle). The softcover edition (English version) will be printed in the US by Blurb and directly shipped. For this option, select Spirituality tier and the shipping cost will be automatically added to your pledge.</p><p>For European citizens only, the softcover edition (Italian or English version) will be printed in Italy and then shipped to you. When creating and supporting a Kickstarter, the shipping cost takes a large part of the overall budget. This is especially true of international shipping. So, to cut down the costs, we are using a print-on-demand service and we will organize the orders on geographical basis.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Honor tier and up, only tracked shipping* is available and added to your pledge. The hardcover edition will be printed only in English. We decided to print it here in Italy to ensure the overall quality of the print process would be easy for us to control directly. We really care about the Special Collector's Edition and we want it to be of the very highest, impeccable quality.&nbsp;</p><p>* <i>about shipping: International shipping of books is quite expensive and tracking globally is available at different levels of detail. Some tracking services give information until the package reaches the international drop point and don't follow the package all the way to its destination. When not explicitly stated, tracked shipping may not be available.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Add-ons are bonus items you can add by increasing your pledge by the appropriate amount.</p><ul><li>Available for Honesty backers and up: Your pledge didn't include the e-book or only one e-book and you want the e-book in both languages (Italian or&nbsp;English version of Through the Moongate: Vol I)? We can fix it! Add 8€ to your pledge for one e-book and 15€ for both!</li></ul><p>More to be announced if goal is reached!&nbsp;</p><p>When determining our minimum funding goal, we had to consider the Kickstarter fees (5% fee plus payment processing fees, between 3% and 5%), editing and translation&nbsp;costs, the layout and design of the cover, the artworks&nbsp;and the e-book, and of course, shipping costs. We did our best to lower our costs as much as possible to produce a reasonable funding goal without sacrificing the final quality of the book.</p><div contenteditable="false" data-alt-text="" data-caption="" data-id="22468440">
