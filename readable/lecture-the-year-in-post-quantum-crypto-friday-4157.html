<p>  The world is finally catching on to the urgency
<br>  of deploying post-quantum cryptography:
<br>  cryptography designed to survive attacks by quantum computers.
<br>  NIST's post-quantum competition is in full swing,
<br>  and network protocols are exploring post-quantum extensions.
<br>  This talk will take the audience on a journey
<br>  through selected recent highlights
<br>  from the post-quantum world.</p>
<p>  Post-quantum cryptography has become one of the most active
<br>  areas in cryptography,
<br>  trying to address important questions from potential users.</p>

<p>  Is post-quantum cryptography secure?
<br>  In the first ten months of this year
<br>  we have seen several serious breaks
<br>  of submissions to the NIST competition.
<br>  At this point, out of the original 69 submissions,
<br>  13 are broken and 8 are partially broken.
<br>  Are the remaining 48 submissions all secure?
<br>  Or is this competition a denial-of-service attack
<br>  against the cryptanalysis community?
<br>  NIST will select fewer candidates for the 2nd round,
<br>  but it is not clear whether there is an adequate basis
<br>  for judging security.</p>

<p>  Does post-quantum cryptography provide
<br>  the functionality we expect from cryptography?
<br>  For example,
<br>  the original Diffie-Hellman system
<br>  provides not just encryption
<br>  but also more advanced features
<br>  such as non-interactive key exchange
<br>  (not provided by any NIST submissions)
<br>  and blinding.
<br>  The era of post-NIST post-quantum cryptography has begun
<br>  with the exciting new CSIDH proposal,
<br>  which has non-interactive key exchange
<br>  and is smaller than any NIST submission,
<br>  but uses more CPU time and needs much more study.</p>

<p>  Is post-quantum cryptography small enough?
<br>  Even for network protocols that rely purely on encryption,
<br>  integration remains a major problem
<br>  because of the bandwidth requirements of most post-quantum systems,
<br>  especially the post-quantum systems
<br>  with the strongest security track records.
<br>  Experiments with integration of post-quantum cryptography into TLS
<br>  have focused on encryption without post-quantum authentication.
<br>  A new generation of network protocols
<br>  has been designed from the ground up for full post-quantum security.</p>

<p>  Is post-quantum cryptographic software fast enough,
<br>  and is it safe to use?
<br>  Adding post-quantum cryptography
<br>  to the cryptographic software ecosystem
<br>  has produced a giant step backwards in software quality.
<br>  Major areas of current activity include
<br>  software speedups,
<br>  benchmarking,
<br>  bug fixes,
<br>  formal verification,
<br>  patent avoidance, and
<br>  development of post-quantum software libraries
<br>  such as Open Quantum Safe and libpqcrypto.</p>

<p>  The talk will be given as a joint presentation
<br>  by Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange.</p>
