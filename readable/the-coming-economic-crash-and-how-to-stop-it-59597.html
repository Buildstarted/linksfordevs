Now I’m seeing serious warning signs in the economy again — and I’m calling on regulators and Congress to act before another crisis costs America’s families their homes, jobs, and savings.</p><p id="72db" data-selectable-paragraph="">I’ve spent most of my career getting to the bottom of what’s happening to working families in America. And when I saw the seeds of the 2008 crisis growing, I rang the alarm as loud as I could.</p><p id="4003" data-selectable-paragraph="">In<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/credit/more/cement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> 2003</a>, I called out subprime lenders for tricking unsuspecting families — especially families of color — into refinancing into overpriced subprime mortgages.

Those trends — shady subprime lending, rising household debt, a mortgage market where lenders didn’t bear the risk of their loans — set the stage for the 2008 crisis.</p><p id="b79e" data-selectable-paragraph="">But the people with the power to stop the crisis didn’t listen — not enough of them anyway.
