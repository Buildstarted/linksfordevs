<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Thoroughly updated, this fourth edition focuses on modern techniques used to generate synthetic three-dimensional images in a fraction of a second. With the advent of programmable shaders, a wide variety of new algorithms have arisen and evolved over the past few years. This edition discusses current, practical rendering methods used in games and other applications. It also presents a solid theoretical framework and relevant mathematics for the field of interactive computer graphics, all in an approachable style. <b>New to this edition: </b>new chapter on VR and AR as well as expanded coverage of Visual Appearance, Advanced Shading, Global Illumination, and Curves and Curved Surfaces.</p>


<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<li>Covers topics from essential mathematical foundations to advanced techniques used by today’s cutting edge games</li>

<li>Case studies are grounded in specific real-time rendering technologies</li>

<li>Revised and revamped for its updated fourth edition, which focuses on modern techniques and used to generate three-dimensional images in a fraction of time old processes took</li>

<li>Covers practical rendering for games to math and details for better interactive applications. </li>



<p>Reviews</p>

<p>"This is the book I recommend to everyone starting out in the industry. Not only is it a great reference on so many topics, each topic is covered in impressive depth with great references for further exploration." — Alex Vlachos, Valve</p><p><b><br></b>"<i>Real-Time Rendering</i> condenses literally thousands of cutting-edge papers, talks, and blogs into a single, easy-to-read volume presenting today's best practices, open problems, and promising state-of-the-art research. A key reference for beginners and experts!" — Chris Wyman, Principal Research Scientist, NVIDIA<b>　</b></p>

<p>"Since it was first published, <i>Real-Time Rendering</i> has been an invaluable companion to anyone who wants to keep up with this dynamic field. It combines rigorous coverage of the fundamentals with up-to-date discussion of the latest techniques. The fourth edition is required reading for anyone serious about computer graphics." — Matt Pharr, co-author of <i>Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation</i></p><p>"I built our rendering engine and my career on what I learned in previous editions of <i>Real-Time Rendering</i>. This new edition is carefully updated to represent the current state of our field, and will remain the first resource I check when tackling a new challenge." — Patrick Cozzi, Principal Graphics Architect, Cesium, and co-editor of <i>OpenGL Insights</i></p><p>"<i>Real-Time Rendering</i> is the first book I recommend reading to anyone who wants to learn real-time graphics. All the relevant knowledge in one place, and a joy to read, too!" — Aras Pranckevičius, Unity Technologies<b> </b></p>
<p><b>About the Cover</b>: The cover shows an example of advanced real-time rendering technology used in the 2018 <i>Star Wars</i>™ short <i>Reflections</i>, which includes real-time ray tracing of reflections and area light shadows computed on the GPU. The short was produced by Epic Games and built in Unreal Engine in collaboration with ILMxLAB and NVIDIA.</p>
