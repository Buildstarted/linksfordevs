		<p>First, hats off to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080214220258/http://www.mono-project.com/about/index.html">Mono team</a>.&nbsp; I think they've done a great job at writing some great software, but also at proving that evil MS really does know how to produce a truly common language runtime that can be properly standardized and ported to other platforms and&nbsp;languages.</p> <p>Now for the meat of my blog.&nbsp; Working on the AMD64 JIT for the runtime is really fun, but it has a few downsides.&nbsp; You we are the 'second' JIT that MS has written.&nbsp; As such the knee-jerk reaction of testers is not to consult the spec and see if what we're doing is different, but acceptable.&nbsp; Instead they blindly compare it to the first JIT (the x86 JIT) and if it's different and it breaks their test, it must be wrong.&nbsp; As we all know, 2 different implementations of the same spec are going to behave differently.</p> <p>The biggest difference I see is that the AMD64 JIT has borrowed a lot of code and optimizations from the native AMD64 compiler.&nbsp; Because of this, we perform some optimizations that are 100% legal according to the CLR spec, but that are certainly unexpected by those who have been using the x86 JIT for a while.&nbsp; Almost all of these examples stem from end users not writing proper thread safe code.</p> <p>Here's a real example from System.Collections.Hashtable:</p> <p><code>private bucket[] buckets;</code></p> <p><code>public virtual bool ContainsKey(Object key) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (key == null) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw new ArgumentNullException("key", Environment.GetResourceString("ArgumentNull_Key"));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uint seed;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uint incr;<br><strong><span color="#008000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Take a snapshot of buckets, in case another thread resizes table<br></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bucket[] lbuckets = buckets;<br></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uint hashcode = InitHash(key, <strong>lbuckets.Length</strong>, out seed, out incr);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int&nbsp; ntry = 0;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bucket b;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int bucketNumber = (int) (seed % (uint)<strong>lbuckets.Length</strong>);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b = <strong>lbuckets</strong>[bucketNumber];<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (b.key == null) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return false;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (((b.hash_coll &amp;&nbsp; 0x7FFFFFFF) == hashcode) &amp;&amp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KeyEquals (b.key, key))<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return true;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bucketNumber = (int) (((long)bucketNumber + incr)% (uint)<strong>lbuckets.Length</strong>);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } while (b.hash_coll &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; ++ntry &lt; lbuckets.Length);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return false;<br>}</p></code></p> <p>I added the emphasis.&nbsp; Notice the comment that indicates the code is assuming that <code>this.buckets</code> will change on another thread. With the x86 JIT, simply copying the member into a local was enough.&nbsp; However, the AMD64 JIT applied some simple copy-propagation to this code and realized that since the this pointer was already enregistered, it was easy to access <code>this.buckets</code> as a simple indirection. So the AMD64 JIT completely ignores the local copy.&nbsp;At this point some of you might be thinking that was an illegal optimization.&nbsp; It's not.&nbsp; Go read the specs and study your compiler theory.</p> <p>There is exactly one thing needed to correct this method.&nbsp; Its the volatile keyword.&nbsp; By simply marking the buckets member as being volatile, then the JIT <strong>cannot</strong> add or remove reads or writes to it, thus it cannot copy-prop.</p> <p>As a side note, I believe this code really is fine even if the buckets array does get bigger on another thread.&nbsp; It would only have a problem it buckets got smaller after bucketNumber was calculated, but before it was used to index into the array.&nbsp; Don't quote me on this, but&nbsp;I vaguely remember that Hashtable never does resize smaller, so this really is a total non-issue, but still a good example.</p> <p>--Grant</p>
