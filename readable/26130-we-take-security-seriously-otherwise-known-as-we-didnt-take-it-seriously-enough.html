We are still investigating, but as far as we know, the attacker only gained access to these parts of our systems.

But here’s what really got my attention in Plex’s email today:</p><blockquote><p>We're sorry for the inconvenience, but both your privacy and security are very important to us</p></blockquote><p>Oh good, feeling much better now! So privacy and security are important, but with the benefit of hindsight, probably not important enough. Which got me thinking about all the other times I’d seen similar statements and just how hollow they’ve now become; it’s corporate speak personified. To demonstrate, let me stand back and let others to do the talking in this post…</p><h2>Anthem after 78.8M customer and employee records were exposed</h2><h2>Adult Friend Finder after 3.9M accounts of people looking for sex were exposed</h2><h2>Gaana after 10M records were exposed</h2><h2>Samsung after 600M devices were found to trust unsigned SwiftKey updates</h2><h2>eBay after 145M records were compromised</h2><p><a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/reset?_trkparms=clkid%3D7074008069859292389"><img width="825" height="126" title="" alt="We take security on eBay very seriously, and we want to ensure that you feel safe and secure buying and selling on eBay.
