        <p>
          Invariably my work requires to create and consume various presentations of differing nature. I also spend a
          reasonable amount of time learning, and relearning my own mistakes in crafting presentations. This post
          attempts to collate these together to remind myself and potentially share with others.
        </p>
        <h3 id="premise">
          Premise
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              80%+ of all failures in an organization larger than 1.000 people is attributable to failed communication
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Presentations, either as verb or noun, are a substantial part of communications in a business
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Ergo, improving your presentations will improve effectiveness of your organization
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="rules">
          Rules
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>No Builds</strong>. No presentation needs builds or animations, no exceptions. In business this
              will invariably go wrong. Your audience will ask to go back a slide or two, you end up half way in a
              build, or worse, with an empty slide. None of this is needed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Minimum font size 14pt or 25px</strong>. Yes, not all the words in your mind will fit on that one
              page. Yes, that constraint will actually help you creating a clearer narrative. If it does not fit, you
              are not done clarifying your concise messaging.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Use fewer words</strong>. Rule number 2 is trying to help you here. But for each iteration I set
              myself the goal of removing half the words. This is hard, as I feel you need to leave out important
              details and context. There is a place for details and context, but neither are <strong>the actual message
              you want to get across</strong>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Stick with your organizations template</strong>. The challenge when you deviate from the default
              template is that it will become cute, a timesink or a distraction for the reader. So stick with the
              default. Don’t like the default? Then create a new one as a separate activity. (You now also crossed the
              chasm from author to designer, I hope you know what you are doing.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Ensure your slide has a take-away</strong>. The slide presents thoughts, data, or whatever; too
              often the conlcusion or the action point of it is left to the reader or as voice over. Do not do this;
              spell it out for your audience. They did not sign up for a Sherlock Holmes role-play.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Executive Summary</strong>. Have one. No, have two: the slide after your title slide should be
              your executive summary. Then run through your story line and bookend again with the executive summary.
              This should be pixel for pixel the same content as the one in the beginning. Your executive summary is
              not allowed to introduce anything new; no new data, concepts or conclusions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Structure</strong>. Stories can be told in many different ways. One way that works well in most
              situations is to divide the story arc up in Situation, Complication and Solution. Leaving one of these
              three components out will seriously hamper your ability to convince your audience, just like it is hard
              to ascend a staircase with stairs missing. Yes, this is advice is coming from Professional Career
              PowerPoint Wielders: take it <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. That link lays out the structure, and has actual examples to get you going.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Slide numbers</strong>. Each slide should have one. Not having one on random slides is telling me
              you fumbled the slides together. It makes it hard for me to take notes, or to speed up asking questions
              at the end. Do not do this to your audience. Cheap to fix.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Data points</strong>. Chances are you have mentioned some piece of data somewhere. That is good.
              Not all is lost. Just make sure that you make clear what the units are. Something costs 1 million? Is
              that Euro’s or Dollars? Almost no costs I encounter are static, in other words they are likely better
              expressed as a rate of costs: “This option will cost 1 million dollars per year, starting April 1st”.
              Secondly, if you have a lot riding on the data point (and why include it if you do not?) then make sure
              attribute or source the data point. The more authorative you can make this, the better.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Graphs</strong> I feel this requires it’s own article. In fact entire books <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> have been written on the topic. Instead, I will
            attempt to quickly run down the top points
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>All axis are labeled</strong>. What do they represent, and include a unit
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Pie charts</strong>. Invariably a time series chart will lead to better comparison of the
                data and will give the audience a sense of temporal change that Pie charts lack
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Font sizes</strong>. You are still creating a presentation, so rule #2 still applies
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Context</strong>. Showing a graph with error rates? Great! But do include the normal rates in
                the same graph for comparison
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Wall of text</strong> Do not every present a slide while starting off with “Well, I’m not going
              to read all this out to you, but…”. You have lost half the audience because they are reading your wall of
              text. You lost the other half because you are being disrespectful to them. So simply do not include any
              wall of text. Rule #2 is here to help you with that.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Homework</strong> Linked to #11: at times I see people include slides like this to arm-wavey make
              the point that they did a lot of homework in this area. If you are that person, ask yourself why the
              audience would assume you did not do your homework. You are likely operating under baseless assumptions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Artifacts</strong> Some people insist on sending the slides ahead of time. I think that depends
              on the situation. However, I insist on sending the slides after the fact. Do not waste time by forcing
              your audience to ask for it, take half correct notes or worse interrupt your presentation over Zoom with
              a photocamera sound as they are taking screenshots. Send the deck to them afterwards, thanking them for
              their time.
            </p>

            <strong>Typography</strong> Grok the basics of typography. Think of this as a set of battle tested
            heuristics that do not require you to understand but just apply. I have found that <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html">Practical Typography</a> is a fantastic
            resource for this. A couple of quick relevant ones are:
            <ul>
              <li>Do not use bold and italics together.
              </li>
              <li>Do not underline at all.
              </li>
              <li>Consider font size, line spacing, line length at first
              </li>
              <li>The question marke is underused, the exclamation point overused <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref">
                <a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
              </li>
              <li>Treat headings as the structure of your argument, not your document
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
