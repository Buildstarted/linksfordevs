Hackers reportedly stole 240,000 records from the Utah Gun Exchange, according to Forbes. The information taken includes customer email addresses, login names and passwords.

That law says ballots can begin being mailed to registered voters 21 days before an election. The clerks are asking to change that to 28 days before the election, to allow more time for mail-in ballots to be delivered and processed by the post office.</p><p><div><div><div><p><img src="https://kutv.com/resources/media/cd97f22d-0be5-4ce3-83dd-ba1648c4e244-medium16x9_WeaskedtheSaltLakeCountyclerkaboutmailinballots.AdamForgieKUTV5.JPG?1597695893332" alt=""></p><p>Salt Lake County Clerk Sherrie Swensen talks to 2News reporter Cristina Flores about mail-in ballots and the 2020 election.

Stephen Handy is sponsoring a bill to address the election during the COVID-19 pandemic, but he says it's unlikely the bill will give USPS more time to collect and process mail-in ballots. Handy tells 2News:</p><blockquote>The bill doesn't break any new ground, but given the environment we are in, political messages coming from the White House, the legislatures is going to affirm that we have a safe election process, that there is incredible integrity in the process."</blockquote><p>There will still be in-person voting as well as early voting, according to Handy, who says after an investigation there was no need to give the post office more time. "What weâ€™ve been seeing in the investigation weâ€™ve been doing is three weeks are adequate," Handy says.</p><p><strong><em>Watch our full interview with Swensen <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KUTV2News/videos/1152947951743407" target="_blank" title="https://www.facebook.com/KUTV2News/videos/1152947951743407">here</a> or below:</em></strong></p><p>The bill will address some changes:<br></p><ul><li>For the 2020 election only: requires each county provide in-person voting of some kind. If it's drive up, walk up, drive through, or a combination of the three, each county can make their own determination.</li><li>If the health risks are too high, Utah could shutdown in person voting, but the state would have to allow ballots to be accepted up to day of election or add more ballot boxes.<br></li></ul><p>Salt Lake County Clerk Sherrie Swensen says:</p><blockquote>Iâ€™m a little bit concerned because we don't know if [the post office] had staffing cuts or what their situation is.  Also, in Salt Lake County, we will be sending out more ballots than weâ€™ve ever sent. We have more registered voters than weâ€™ve ever had. Comparatively in 2018, for the general election, we had  517,000 active registered voters.  Right now, we have 562,000.

Stephen Handy is sponsoring a bill to address the election during the COVID-19 pandemic, but he says it's unlikely the bill will give USPS more time to collect and process mail-in ballots. Handy tells 2News:</p><blockquote>The bill doesn't break any new ground, but given the environment we are in, political messages coming from the White House, the legislatures is going to affirm that we have a safe election process, that there is incredible integrity in the process."</blockquote><p>There will still be in-person voting as well as early voting, according to Handy, who says after an investigation there was no need to give the post office more time. "What weâ€™ve been seeing in the investigation weâ€™ve been doing is three weeks are adequate," Handy says.</p><p><strong><em>Watch our full interview with Swensen <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KUTV2News/videos/1152947951743407" target="_blank" title="https://www.facebook.com/KUTV2News/videos/1152947951743407">here</a> or below:</em></strong></p><p>The bill will address some changes:<br></p><ul><li>For the 2020 election only: requires each county provide in-person voting of some kind.
