However when tested on building a simple landing page, they fail out. I fell down this hole before as well. It's good to make sure you have a solid understand of the building blocks.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Some key core lackings:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Semantic elements, Stateful html elements, Box model, Difference between block and inline, Responsive units and @media queries, Browser compatibility, Relying too much on frameworks like bootstrap</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Edit:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A lot of questions on stateful html elements. Note I have taken this question of my interview a while ago. This is not something you can just Google.  I may not have been asking it correctly which is why candidates did not understand. This is referring to elements like inputs and select boxes that manage state of the users input, text, checked, selected options. This state can be consumed by css and javascript.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Edit:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I also want to add. I have 4 professional years of experience in building production react web apps. In my opinion, you should not call HTML/CSS "old" methodologies or tools just because you know a js framework. This stuff is important. You can not make custom, good, accessible, responsive web apps with a solid UI without these core concepts.</p></div></div></div></div>
