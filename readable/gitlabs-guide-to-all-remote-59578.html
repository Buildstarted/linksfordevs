<p><strong>"Remote is not a challenge to overcome. It's a clear business advantage."</strong> -Victor, Product Manager, GitLab</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the cost savings on office space to more flexibility in employees' daily lives, all-remote work offers a number of advantages to organizations and their people.</p>
<p>But we also recognize that being part of an all-remote company isn't for everyone. Here's a look at some of the advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>All-remote means that each individual in an organization is empowered to work and live where they are most fulfilled. By including the word "all" in "all-remote," it makes clear that every team member is equal. No one, not even the executive team, meets in-person on a daily basis.</p>

<p>GitLab envisions a world where talented, driven individuals can find roles and seek employment based on business needs, rather than an oftentimes arbitrary location.</p>
<p>Hiring across the globe isn't without its challenges. There are local regulations and risks unique to countries and regions around the globe. We believe that these challenges are worth overcoming, and opening our recruiting pipeline beyond the usual job centers creates a competitive advantage. We hope to see this advantage wane as more all-remote companies are created.</p>

<h2 id="compensation">Compensation<a href="#compensation"></a></h2>

<h2 id="self-service">Self-service<a href="#self-service"></a></h2>
<p>It's not what you know. It's knowing <strong>where to look</strong>. This is true at GitLab and other organizations that are intentional about documenting processes, and it is entirely counter to how typical work environments are structured.</p>

<h2 id="informal-communication">Informal Communication<a href="#informal-communication"></a></h2>
<p>In an all-remote environment, informal communication should be formally addressed.

<p>A handbook-first organization is home to team members who benefit from having a single source of truth to lean on. This type of organization is able to operate with almost supernatural efficiency. An organization that does not put concerted effort into documenting has no choice but to watch its team members ask and re-ask for same bits of data in perpetuity, creating a torturous loop of interruptions, meetings, and suboptimal knowledge transfers.</p>

<h2 id="in-person-interactions">In-person interactions<a href="#in-person-interactions"></a></h2>
<p>While there are tremendous advantages to operating a 100% remote company, leaders should consider being intentional about planning in-person elements, even if they're optional for team members.</p>
