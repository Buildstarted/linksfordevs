<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On May 25, 2020, my life shattered as I learned of the tragic passing of my dear brother, George.&nbsp;</p><p>My family and I watched in absolute horror as the now infamous and&nbsp;horrifying video began to spread quickly throughout social media. What we saw on that tape left us shell shocked; a&nbsp;white Minneapolis police officer kneeling directly on my brother's neck, obstructing his ability to breathe. As some officers knelt on his neck, other officers participated and watched; no one took any action to save my brother's life. &nbsp;Those officers would continue to brutalize my brother until he died.&nbsp;This fund is established to cover funeral and burial expenses, mental and grief counseling, lodging and travel for all court proceedings, and to assist our family in the days to come as we continue to seek justice for George. &nbsp;A portion of these funds will also go to the Estate of George Floyd for the benefit and care of his children and their educational fund.</p><p>&nbsp;Anyone wishing to send cards, letters of encouragement &nbsp;and/or contributions in the form of a money order or check, may do so by mail at:</p><p>&nbsp;The Estate of George Floyd<br>c/o Ben Crump Law, PLLC<br>122 S. Calhoun Street<br>Tallahassee, FL&nbsp;32301<br>Attn: Adner Marcelin</p><p>&nbsp;All checks&nbsp;must&nbsp;be made out to: The Estate of George Floyd</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Commonly asked questions:</p><p>&nbsp;1.
