        <p itemprop="description">
            In my last article, I looked at some of the new things that ASP.NET Core 3.0 will introduce to Razor Pages developers. One of the features that I touched on was Razor Components. In this article, I take a more detailed look at what they are and how they can be used.
        </p>

        

        <section itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Razor components form part of the Blazor framework. Blazor is a single page application development framework whose key feature is that it enables you to write the entire application in C# and have it execute in the browser. 
To do this, a new .NET runtime is needed that works with WebAssembly. Blazor began life as an experimental framework. 
As part of its evolution, a server-side model was introduced where the C# code 
executes on the web server, and a SignalR connection is used to make updates to 
the application in the browser in real time. This model was
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/aspnet-core-3-preview-2/">
officially incorporated as part of .NET Core 3.0 in Preview 2</a>, and was 
initially named Razor Components. In Preview 4, the development model was
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-0-preview-4/">
renamed to Server-side Blazor</a>. The term <em>Razor Component</em> now refers 
to a specific building block within the Blazor framework rather than a 
development framework itself.</p>
<p>Within Blazor, Razor components can perform many roles. They can represent a 
specific piece of UI, equivalent to a Razor Pages partial, view component 
or a tag helper. Or they can 
represent a layout. Or they can represent an entire page. When used in a Razor 
Page (or indeed an MVC view), they will take the place of a partial, a view 
component or a custom tag helper.</p>
<p>Razor components are created in files with a <em>.razor</em> extension. They 
can also be created in <em>.cshtml </em>files, but that way lies potential 
confusion if you ask me. This is enabled mainly to aid backward compatibility 
with older previews. The <em>.razor</em> file contains a mixture of HTML 
and C#, embedded in the HTML using the familiar Razor syntax. </p>
<h3>A Pager Component</h3>
<p>The example that follows shows how to create a Razor component that generates 
paging links and then incorporate it into a Razor page. This has been developed 
using Visual Studio 2019 16.3.0 Preview 1.0, and Preview 7 of .NET Core 3.0. </p>
<ol>
<li>The first step is to make Blazor available to the application. This is done in the 
<code>ConfigureServices</code> method: 
<pre>services.AddServerSideBlazor();</pre>
</li>
<li>Next, add a folder named <em>Components</em> to the project. Within the folder, add a new file named 
<em>_Imports.razor</em>. You can use the Razor Component template option to do this. Or you can add a text file and change the extension.</li>

<li>Replace any existing content in the <em>_Imports.razor</em> file with the following line of code:
<pre> @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components</pre>
<p>This file works in a similar way to how <a href="https://www.learnrazorpages.com/razor-pages/files/viewimports"><em>_ViewImports.cshtml</em> works within a Razor Pages application</a> except that it only affects Blazor artefacts. It provides a way to bring namespaces into scope within Razor components placed in the same folder as the file, or any sub folders.</p></li>
<li>Add a new file to the <em>Components</em> folder named <em>Pager.razor</em>. Use the Razor Component option available from Add new item:
<p><img src="https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/images/2019-07-22_134525.png" alt="Add Razor Component"></p></li>
<li>Replace any existing content with the following code:
<pre><span>&lt;</span><span>ul</span> <span>class</span>="<span>pagination</span>"<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>@</span><span>for</span>(<span>var</span> i = 1; i &lt;= totalPages; i++)
    {
        <span>&lt;</span><span>li</span> <span>class</span>="<span>page-item</span> <span>@</span>(i == pageNumber ? <span>"active"</span> : <span>""</span>)"<span>&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;</span><span>a</span> <span>href</span>="<span>@</span>linkUrl/<span>@</span>i" <span>class</span>="<span>page-link</span>"<span>&gt;</span><span>@</span>i<span>&lt;/</span>a<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;/</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span>
    }
<span>&lt;/</span><span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>@code {</span>
    [<span>Parameter</span>] <span>int</span> pageNumber { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }
    [<span>Parameter</span>] <span>int</span> totalRecords { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }
    [<span>Parameter</span>] <span>int</span> pageSize { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; } = 20;
    [<span>Parameter</span>] <span>string</span> linkUrl { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>;  }
    <span>int</span> totalPages =&gt; (<span>int</span>)<span>Math</span>.Ceiling((<span>decimal</span>)totalRecords / pageSize);
<span>}</span></pre>
<p>The code at the top of the file is familiar to anyone who has worked with 
Razor. It combines HTML with C# to render an unordered list containing list 
items for each paging link. The markup makes use of Bootstrap 4 styling to 
render buttons. </p>
<p>The <code>@code</code> block is equivalent to the <code>@functions</code> 
block that you might see in MVC views and Razor Pages. In fact, you can 
replace <code>@code</code> with <code>@functions</code> in a <em>.razor</em> 
file, although you can't use <code>@code</code> in a .cshtml file - at least not 
in .NET Core 3.0 Preview 7. This is where you place blocks of C# code, including 
property declarations and local methods.</p>
<p>The <code>[Parameter]</code> attribute is used to expose private properties 
as parameters to callers so that you can pass arbitrary values in to the 
component. In this case, you want to allow the caller to be able to pass in the 
current page (<code>pageNumber</code>), the total number of records, the number 
of records per page (<code>pageSize</code>) and the URL that the link should 
point to. The total number of paging links is calculated from the number of 
records and the page size.</p></li>
<li>The <code>RenderComponentAsync&lt;T&gt;</code> method is used to include the component in a Razor page, with parameter values passed as an object:
<pre><span>@(</span><span>await</span> Html.RenderComponentAsync&lt;<span>Pager</span>&gt;(<span> new</span> { pageNumber = Model.PageNumber, totalRecords = 150, pageSize = 20, linkUrl = Url.PageLink(<span>"Index"</span>)}))</pre>
<img src="https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/images/razor_component.png" alt="Razor Component"></li>
</ol>
<p>You don't have to place your properties and methods in an <code>@code</code> block. You can create a class that derives from
<code>ComponentBase</code> and then have the <em>.razor</em> file inherit from that. Here's how that translates to the Pager component above. </p>
<p>Create a class named <em>PagerComponent</em> with the following content:</p>
<pre><span>using</span> Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;

<span>public class</span> <span>PagerComponent</span> : <span>ComponentBase</span>
{
    [<span>Parameter</span>] <span>public int</span> PageNumber { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }
    [<span>Parameter</span>] <span>public int</span> TotalRecords { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }
    [<span>Parameter</span>] <span>public int</span> PageSize { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; } = 20;
    [<span>Parameter</span>] <span>public string</span> LinkUrl { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }
    <span>public int</span> TotalPages =&gt; (<span>int</span>)<span>Math</span>.Ceiling((<span>decimal</span>)TotalRecords / PageSize);
}</pre>
<p>Then alter the content of the <em>Pager.razor</em> file as follows:</p>
<pre><span>@inherits</span> <span>PagerComponent</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>ul</span> <span>class</span>="<span>pagination</span>"<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>@</span><span>for</span>(<span>var</span> i = 1; i &lt;= TotalPages; i++)
    {
        <span>&lt;</span><span>li</span> <span>class</span>="<span>page-item</span> <span>@</span>(i == PageNumber ? <span>"active"</span> : <span>""</span>)"<span>&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;</span><span>a</span> <span>href</span>="<span>@L</span>inkUrl/<span>@</span>i" <span>class</span>="<span>page-link</span>"<span>&gt;</span><span>@</span>i<span>&lt;/</span>a<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;/</span><span>li</span><span>&gt;</span>
    }
<span>&lt;/</span><span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span>

</pre>
<p>If you re-run the application, the component should render as before. There is no need to change the casing of the parameter names in the object that you pass to the 
<code>RenderComponentAsync</code> method to match the casing of the new class public properties. Blazor does a case-insensitive match when binding parameter values to properties.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Razor components can easily be used within a Razor Pages application. UI and processing code can be partitioned within the same file, or separated out into different files, which can help with unit testing.</p>
