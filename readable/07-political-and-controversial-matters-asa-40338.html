										<h2>Background</h2>
									
									<div><p>The Communications Act 2003 prohibits political advertising. The term "political" is used in the Code in a wider sense than "party political". The prohibition includes, for example, campaigning for the purposes of influencing legislation or executive action by local or national (including foreign) governments. The definitions of "political" for the purposes of an advertiser's status and for the content of advertisements are set out in section 321 of the Communications Act 2003 ("the Act"). The relevant parts of that section are reproduced below in Rule 7.2.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the application of the rules that prohibit "political" advertising and whether an advertiser and/or the content of an advertisement is caught by the prohibition has not been contracted out to BCAP or the ASA. This responsibility remains with Ofcom. The ASA therefore refers all such matters to Ofcom.</p></div>
