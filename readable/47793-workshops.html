<h2>Mastering Burp Suite Pro, 100% hands-on (<span class="caps">EN</span>)</h2>
<p><strong>3 days </strong>training, by <strong>Nicolas Gr&#xE9;goire</strong></p>
<p>This training will be given in <strong><span class="caps">ENGLISH</span></strong></p>
<p>Price: <strong><span class="caps">CHF</span> 2250.-&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span class="caps">DESCRIPTION</span></span></strong></p>
<p>As nicely said in PoC||<span class="caps">GTFO</span> Volume <span class="caps">II</span>, &#xAB; This is not a&#xA0;book about astronomy; rather, this is a&#xA0;book about telescopes &#xBB;. In the same spirit, this training isn&#x2019;t about Web hacking. Instead, this training is for Web hackers who want to master their toolbox. Burp Suite Pro is the leading tool for auditing Web applications at large, but also a&#xA0;complex beast where new features get added every few weeks. Mastering Burp Suite Pro, including its newest features, allows testers to get the most out of the tool, optimizing time spent auditing and testing. Work will be faster (hotkeys!) and much more efficient (more tools, more possibilities!). Attendees will also learn to measure and assess the quality of their attacks, a&#xA0;crucial skill in real-life engagements that can make the difference between a&#xA0;false-negative and a&#xA0;critical finding.</p>
<span class="collapseomatic arrowright" id="id5e1deb79bba06"><strong><span class="caps">ABOUT</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">TRAINERS</span></strong></span><div id="target-id5e1deb79bba06" class="collapseomatic_content">Nicolas Gr&#xE9;goire (aka @Agarri_FR) has nearly 20 years of experience in penetration testing and auditing of networks and (mostly Web) applications. He is an official Burp Suite Pro trainer since 2015, and trained hundreds of people since then, either privately or during infosec events. Outside of that, he runs Agarri, an one-guy company where he finds security bugs for customers and for fun. His public security research (that mostly deals with <span class="caps">XML</span>, <span class="caps">XSLT</span> and <span class="caps">SSRF</span>) was presented at numerous conferences around the world (HackInTheBox, ZeroNights, HackInParis, Nullcon, ...). He was also thanked by numerous vendors for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities in their products and services, directly or through bug bounty programs.

<span class="collapseomatic arrowright" id="id5e1deb79bba7f"><strong><span class="caps">COURSE</span> <span class="caps">OUTLINE</span></strong></span><div id="target-id5e1deb79bba7f" class="collapseomatic_content">
<p>Every trainee goes through the main track, composed of nearly 100 challenges. Plenty of additional ones are available, depending on your speed, taste, skills and professional needs. No way to get bored! Among the available challenges: complex brute-force, data extraction, support of custom formats, automatic management of anti-CSRF tokens, WebSockets, weak cryptography, webhooks, NoSQL injections, authorizations bugs, aggressive disconnection, JWT-authenticated APIs, arbitrary Java deserialization, blind stored <span class="caps">XSS</span>, instrumented Java applications, strict workflows, ...</p>
<p>Day 1<br> After an introduction to the training platform and its challenges, this day is spent on well defined tasks where the goal is to find flags, like in <span class="caps">CTF</span> contests. We practice basic automation using tools like Proxy, Repeater and Intruder. The goal is to improve the speed of our interactions with the tool, while monitoring and self-assessing our attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction: rules and advice, connecting to the network, description of the training platform and its challenges</li>
<li>Getting started: navigating the <span class="caps">GUI</span>, loading custom options, using hotkeys, sorting and filtering data</li>
<li>Match <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&#xA0;Replace: well-known examples, live traffic modifications<br> Repeater: keyboard-only usage, replaying WebSockets traffic, dealing with streamed data</li>
<li>Intruder: coverage of all attack types and most payload types, automatic processing of results with &#x201C;Grep &#x2013; Match&#x201D; and &#x201C;Grep - Extract&#x201D;, data extraction, managing CSRF-tokens without session handling rules, atypical injection points, frobbing and fuzzing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Day 2</p>
<p>On the second day, challenges get more realistic: solving them requires a&#xA0;good understanding of the underlying application and the usage of multiple Burp Suite tools, possibly including extensions. Additionally, we keep working on the efficiency of the testing workflow (using shortcuts or extensions) and on self-monitoring (now with Logger++). The latter skill will prove itself invaluable when working on session handling rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Traffic interception: <span class="caps">HTTP</span> exchanges and WebSocket messages are intercepted and modified on the fly, in order to bypass client-side protections or to subvert the logic of (emulated) mobile apps. That&#x2019;s the only section where &#x201C;Intercept is On&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t a&#xA0;problem</li>
<li>Macros and session handling rules for Web applications: terminology, basic setups, common use-cases (like managing <span class="caps">CSRF</span> tokens or logging-in automatically), applying session handling rules to third-party tools like sqlmap. Note that dealing with Web services (either <span class="caps">SOAP</span> or <span class="caps">REST</span>) is quite different and is covered in the separate section, on the third day</li>
<li>Extensions: review and testing of the most useful and/or popular extensions (Logger++, Hackvertor, <span class="caps">JSON</span> Beautifier, Paramalyzer, Turbo Intruder, ...)</li>
</ul>
<p>Day 3<br> The third day is used to dig deeper in advanced subjects. That covers authorization testing, custom active scanning, Web Services and much more! Built-in features are pushed to their limits, and extra ones provided by extensions are commonly used.</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorization testing: from quick tests w/o specific configuration to deep tests requiring business-specific knowledge (extensions &#x201C;Authz&#x201D;, AutoRepeater&#x201D;, &#x201C;SessionAuth&#x201D; and &#x201C;AuthMatrix&#x201D; are covered)</li>
<li><span class="caps">REST</span> and <span class="caps">SOAP</span> WebServices: why is a&#xA0;specific toolbox needed, generating requests from definition files (<span class="caps">WSDL</span>, OpenAPI, ...), using session handling rules to manage authentication in cookie-less environments</li>
<li>Two-way communication with the target: deploying and using a&#xA0;private Collaborator instance, patching the target byte-code with Infiltrator in order to receive additional details (filename, line number, ...), running an Infiltrator-only active scan</li>
<li>Scans and live tasks: differences between v1 and v2 (terminology, <span class="caps">GUI</span>, usage), using the scanner like in v1, description and testing of the much-improved crawler, configuring and running specialized scans, observing the oriented-graphs generated during crawling, using these graphs with &#x201C;Crawl and Audit&#x201D; (in order to audit CSRF-protected forms without macros)</li>
<li>Headless usage: driving Burp Suite Pro via a&#xA0;<span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> (provided by 3<sup class="ordinal">rd</sup>-party extensions)</li>
<li>Vuln-specific tooling: Blind <span class="caps">XSS</span>, from builtin features to 3<sup class="ordinal">rd</sup>-party tools like Sleepy Puppy</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span><strong><span class="caps">CLASS</span> <span class="caps">REQUIREMENTS</span></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Working knowledge of common Web vulnerabilities (<span class="caps">XSS</span>, SQLi, <span class="caps">SSRF</span>, ...)</li>

<p>We will guide you through systematic analysis of IoT devices to identify vulnerabilities. You will interact directly with hardware interfaces, and become comfortable with using the hardware and software tools of the trade to evaluate IoT devices and their firmware. After having played with different devices, you will have a&#xA0;chance to apply your newly learned skills conducting a&#xA0;penetration test against a&#xA0;smart home.</p>
<p>After the training, you will be able to understand the hardware and software attack surface of IoT devices to help them get more secure. Going forward you will tackle the most common situations confidently, including when the firmware is not publicly available. This training is for security professionals and/or <span class="caps">CTF</span> enthusiasts who want to improve their pwning skills.</p>

<h2>Cloud security Masterclass: Defender&apos;s guide to securing public cloud infrastructure (<span class="caps">EN</span>)</h2>
<p><strong>2 days</strong> training, by <strong>Abhinav Singh</strong></p>
<p>This training will be given in <strong><span class="caps">ENGLISH</span></strong></p>
<p>Normal price: <strong><span class="caps">CHF</span> 1500.-<br>
</strong>Student price: <strong><span class="caps">CHF</span> 800.-<br>
</strong>Special student price (Dipl&#xF4;me f&#xE9;d&#xE9;ral, <span class="caps">MAS</span> <span class="caps">MSSI</span>, <span class="caps">MAS</span> Infosec):<strong> <span class="caps">CHF</span> 1200.-&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span class="caps">DESCRIPTION</span></strong></span></p>
<p>This training focuses on elevating your malware analysis, forensic investigations, and incident response knowledge into the cloud. The hands-on training focuses on building a&#xA0;fully automated malware analysis, threat intelligence, and forensics investigation pipeline by utilizing <span class="caps">AWS</span> based cloud infrastructure. We will cover scenarios, exercises and demos about building fully automated and scalable services that can perform both static as well as dynamic malware analysis, forensic artifact collection at scale, performing automated investigations against <span class="caps">IAM</span> attacks, gathering threat intelligence as well as creating alerts and reports.</p>
<p>By the end of this training, we will be able to use cloud technologies like Cloudtrail and Cloudwatch to detect <span class="caps">IAM</span> attacks, serverless functions to perform on-demand scans, docker containers to deploy our threat scanning services at scale, notification services to create detection alerts, malware-infected virtual machines to perform automated forensic investigations and artifacts collection, DynamoDB and <span class="caps">AWS</span> Athena for building real-time threat intelligence and monitoring dashboards. </p>
<p>We will learn to use in-built <span class="caps">AWS</span> services along with open source and custom-built tools to connect our file scanning services. In all, we will be building a&#xA0;fully automated incident response as well as threat intelligence pipeline that can be used by large scale security teams and researchers.</p>
<p>The workshop will begin by covering details about public cloud infrastructure like <span class="caps">AWS</span>, Azure, and <span class="caps">GCP</span>. We will build a&#xA0;technical and architectural understanding of the cloud and its services in the introductory phase. We will then dive into the Identity and access management based attack and defense scenarios along with running security assessments and automated tests against the entire infrastructure. </p>
<p>The second phase of the workshop will cover hands-on tool building for static file scanning of <span class="caps">AWS</span> object stores using clamAV and Yara engines. We will cover exercises on building and integrating serverless functions to build services like hash lookup, file-type determination and automated signature update through <span class="caps">S3</span> buckets. </p>
<p>The third phase of the workshop will deal with deploying <span class="caps">AWS</span> container services to run malware feature extraction and heuristic detection services at scale. By using real-life scenarios, we will build an alerting and notification service using <span class="caps">SNS</span> and slack. This service will integrate with lambda functions and web sockets to notify users when an infection is found. The next exercise of this phase will focus on building automated response and investigation using tags and cloudwatch events. </p>
<p>In the fourth phase of the workshop, we will learn to build real-time threat intelligence dashboards using Amazon Athena and <span class="caps">ELK</span> stack. We will learn to write queries to derive rich intelligence out of the collected data. </p>
<p>The final phase of the workshop will focus on forensic investigations in <span class="caps">AWS</span>. It begins by creating automated forensic artifact collection, integrating it with automated analysis like building timeline and dumping process memory. We will run through hands-on exercises on building investigation playbooks using step functions to automate most of the investigation and reporting process.</p>
