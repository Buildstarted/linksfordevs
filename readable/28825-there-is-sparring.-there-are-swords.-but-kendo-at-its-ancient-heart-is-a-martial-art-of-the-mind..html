    <h1>There is sparring. There are swords. But kendo, at its ancient heart, is a martial art of the mind.</h1>
    <div id="article-content" class="article-content entry-content"> <p>THERE IS NO trash-talking in kendo.</p>
<p>But there is intimidation &#x2014; even through the metal grille of the helmet, called a <em>men</em>. The opponent can see the eyes, very well. And body posture establishes a presence.</p>
<p>Kendo means &#x201C;the way of the sword&#x201D; and has evolved from the days of the samurai warrior. In kendo, trash-talking would be considered disrespectful not just to the opponent, but to this centuries-old Japanese martial art.</p>
<p><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/this-something-new-is-actually-the-centuries-old-practice-of-kendo/" class="content-link">Backstory: This &#x2018;something new&#x2019; is actually the centuries-old practice of kendo</a></p>
<p>The purpose of the sport is vigorous, disciplined training, along with honor, courtesy and respect. Those goals could seem at odds in a contact sport. But <a href="http://www.seattlekendo.org/" class="content-link external">Seattle Kendo Kai</a> lays it out simply and directly on its website: &#x201C;Manners are paramount. Without etiquette and respect, we are just a bunch of people hitting each other with sticks.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Kendo teaches you how to live and do your best,&#x201D; says Haruka Takano, 61, who adds that he has no pain because the sport keeps him young and free of stress. &#x201C;If you tried your best, you succeeded.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Takano, who arrived early to begin practicing strikes with a dummy called the <em>uchikomi dai</em>, says, &#x201C;Apply yourself, concentrate &#x2014; hitting is cathartic.&#x201D;</p> <p>Seattle Kendo Kai holds practices in St. Peter&#x2019;s Episcopal Church gym on South King Street near the Chinatown International District two or three times a week, with sessions running at least 90 minutes (Sunday practices are 2&#xBD; hours).</p>
<p>The gym is old-school, the precursor of a multipurpose auditorium. There&#x2019;s a modestly lit basketball court with just a few feet of space beyond the nets. A raised stage is on one end. There&#x2019;s a spectator area on another side, also raised, for at most 20 or so visitors.</p>
<p>Practice is not a casual visit to a fitness center with high-decibel music and a treadmill session.</p>
<p>At a recent event, I see that there&#x2019;s a structure:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Shoes are removed.</p>
<p>&#x2022; People bow before entering the dojo, or space.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Students scatter about the gym getting ready. Everyone lines up according to rank, with teachers going first. Then the students, according to rank, face the instructors.</p>
<p>&#x2022; It&#x2019;s quiet, and many people briefly meditate, maybe just 10 seconds, bowing to the banner on the stage. Students and sensei bow to one another. Announcements are made.</p> <p>And they begin: swinging arms, and working on posture and breathing. Then running in a counterclockwise direction. Then sparring, emphasized with shouts called the <em>kiai</em>. This is to concentrate the mind, the body and the sword during a strike.</p>
<p>Swords here are actually four pieces of bamboo bound together with leather. One is called a <em>shinai</em>, and is less dangerous than a metal or solid wood sword.</p>
<p>Harry Goh, both teacher and student, says, despite all the sword strikes, &#x201C;This is mental martial arts, rather than physical. The physical aspect is necessary to know how to control an opponent.&#x201D;</p> <p>Goh, 58, has three decades of experience with kendo but says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m still a student. I still have to learn more.&#x201D; He has learned to induce an opponent to attack by speaking with his posture. But, when his opponent lunges, he responds and is able to strike first.</p>
<p>Opponents are not separated by size, height, weight or age. Most of the participants are men, but there are several women at each session.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a consistency of character in kendo. Youth and fitness give way to experience and wisdom,&#x201D; says Michael Mabale, 44. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a mirror in front of you &#x2014; a mirror of your own strengths and weaknesses. The goal is that each person get better. You try to elevate each other.&#x201D;</p> <p>Imanishi sensei, the head instructor, says the sport &#x201C;prepares you mentally and physically. There is harmony of body, mind and sword.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a credo, he says: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be lazy. Change your mindset.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Steve Guidi, president of Seattle Kendo Kai, says, &#x201C;Originally I wanted to do what I saw in the movies. But it&#x2019;s not about winning. It&#x2019;s a way of life.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At the end of practice, Guidi again briefly meditates, having experienced a good fatigue.</p>
<p>&#x201C;After practice, I reflect on my performance for the session and try to compare it with my performance of a previous day,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;How do I feel about my ability? How can I become a better person? Kendo is a path.&#x201D;</p> </div>
