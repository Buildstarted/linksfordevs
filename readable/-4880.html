However, the use of this connectivity is still only just beginning. Ecommerce is still only a small fraction of retail spending, and many other areas that will be transformed by software and the internet in the next decade or two have barely been touched. Global retail is perhaps $25 trillion dollars, after all. </p><p>Meanwhile, as companies address more and more of this with software and the internet, they do it in new ways. We began with models that presumed low internet penetration, low speeds, little consumer readiness and little capital. Now all of those are inverted. So, we used to do apartment listings and now Opendoor will buy your home; we used to do restaurant reviews and now you can get a hot meal delivered to your door. Tech is building different kinds of businesses, and so will take different shares of that opportunity, but more importantly change what those industries look like. Tesla isnâ€™t interesting because of what it does to gasoline, but because of what it does to the car. Netflix changes TV, but so does Twitch. </p><p>Finally, as we think about the next decade or two, we have some new fundamental building blocks. The internet began as an open, â€˜permissionlessâ€™, decentralized network, but then we got (and indeed needed) new centralised networks on top, and so weâ€™ve spent a lot of the past decade talking about search and social. Machine learning and crypto give new and often decentralized, permissionless fundamental layers for looking at meaning, intent and preference, and for attaching value to those. </p></div></div></div></div>
