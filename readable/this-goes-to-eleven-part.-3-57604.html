        <p>Since there‚Äôs a lot to go over here, I‚Äôve split it up into a few parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In <a href="https://bits.houmus.org/2020-01-28/this-goes-to-eleven-pt1">part 1</a>, we start with a refresher on <code>QuickSort</code> and how it compares to <code>Array.Sort()</code>.</li>
  <li>In <a href="https://bits.houmus.org/2020-01-29/this-goes-to-eleven-pt2">part 2</a>, we go over the basics of vectorized hardware intrinsics, vector types, and go over a handful of vectorized instructions we‚Äôll use in part 3. We still won‚Äôt be sorting anything.</li>
  <li>In this part, we go through the initial code for the vectorized sorting, and we‚Äôll start seeing some payoff. We finish agonizing courtesy of the CPU‚Äôs Branch Predictor, throwing a wrench into our attempts.</li>
  <li>In part 4, we go over a handful of optimization approaches that I attempted trying to get the vectorized partitioning to run faster. We‚Äôll see what worked and what didn‚Äôt.</li>
  <li>In part 5, we‚Äôll see how we can almost get rid of all the remaining scalar code- by implementing small-constant size array sorting. We‚Äôll use, drum roll‚Ä¶, yet more AVX2 vectorization.</li>
  <li>Finally, in part 6, I‚Äôll list the outstanding stuff/ideas I have for getting more juice and functionality out of my vectorized code.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="unstable-vectorized-partitioning--quicksort">Unstable Vectorized Partitioning + QuickSort</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs time we mash all the new knowledge we picked up in the last posts about SIMD registers, instructions, and <code>QuickSort</code>ing into something useful. Here‚Äôs the plan:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vectorized in-place partitioning:
    <ul>
      <li>First, we learn to take 8-element blocks, or units of <code>Vector256&lt;int&gt;</code>, and partition them with AVX2 intrinsics.</li>
      <li>Then we take Berlin: We reuse our block to partition an entire array with a method I named double-pumping, suitable for processing large arrays in-place with this vectorized block.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once we‚Äôve covered vectorized partitioning, we finish up with some innocent glue-code wrapping the whole thing to look like a proper <code>Array.Sort</code> replacement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we‚Äôre doing our own thing, finally, It‚Äôs time to address a baby elephant hiding in the room: Stable vs. Unstable sorting. I should probably bother explaining: One possible way to categorize sorting algorithms is with respect for their stability: Do they reorder <em>equal</em> values as they appear in the original input data or not. Stable sorting does not reorder, while unstable sorting provides no such guarantee.<br>
Stability <em>might</em> be critical for certain tasks, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When sorting an array of structs/classes according to a key embedded as a member, while providing a non-default <code>IComparer&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>Comparison&lt;T&gt;</code>, we might care about preserving the order of the containing type.</li>
  <li>Similarly, when sorting pairs of arrays: keys and values, reordering both arrays according to the sorted order of the keys, while preserving the ordering of values for equal keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the same time, stable sorting is a non-issue when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sorting arrays of simple primitives; stability is meaningless:<br>
(what would a ‚Äústable sort‚Äù of the array <code>[7, 7, 7]</code> even mean?)</li>
  <li>At other times, we <em>know</em> for a fact that our keys are unique. There is no unstable sorting for unique keys.</li>
  <li>Lastly, sometimes, <em>we just don‚Äôt care</em>. We‚Äôre fine if our data gets reordered.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the .NET/C# world, one could say that the landscape regarding sorting is a little unstable (pun intended):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.array.sort?view=netcore-3.1"><code>Array.Sort</code></a> is unstable, as is clearly stated in the remarks section:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This implementation performs an unstable sort; that is, if two elements are equal, their order might not be preserved.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.orderby?view=netcore-3.1"><code>Enumerable.OrderBy</code></a> is stable:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This method performs a stable sort; that is, if the keys of two elements are equal, the order of the elements is preserved.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In general, what I came up with in my full repo/nuget package are algorithms capable of doing both stable and unstable sorting. But with two caveats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stable sorting is considerably slower than unstable sorting (But still faster than <code>Array.Sort</code>).</li>
  <li>Stable sorting is less elegant/fun to explain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given this new information and the fact that I am only presenting pure primitive sorting anyway, where there is no notion of stability to begin with, for this series, I will be describing my unstable sorting approach. It doesn‚Äôt take a lot of imagination to get from here to the stable variant, but I‚Äôm not going to address this in these posts. It is also important to note that in general, when there is a doubt if stability is a requirement (e.g., for key/value, <code>IComparer&lt;T&gt;</code>/<code>Comparison&lt;T&gt;</code>, or non-primitive sorting) we should err on the side of safety and go for stable sorting.</p>

  </div>

  <p>There‚Äôs a lot of cheese here; let‚Äôs break this down:</p>

  <div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>L1</span></p>
<p>Broadcast the pivot value to a vector I‚Äôve named <code>P</code>. We‚Äôre merely creating 8-copies of the selected pivot value in a SIMD register.<br>
Technically, this isn‚Äôt really part of the block as this is this happens only <em>once</em> per partitioning function call! It‚Äôs included here for context.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>L3-5</span></p>
<p>We wrap our block in a static function. We aggressively inline it in strategic places throughout the rest of the code.<br>
This may look like an odd signature, but think of its purpose: We avoid copy-pasting codemwhile also avoiding any performance penalty.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>L6</span></p>
<p>Load up data from somewhere in our array. <code>dataPtr</code> points to some unpartitioned data. <code>dataVec</code> will be loaded with data we intend to partition, and that‚Äôs the important bit.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>L7-8</span></p>
<p>Perform an 8-way comparison using <code>CompareGreaterThan</code>, then proceed to convert/compress the 256-bit result into an 8-bit value using the <code>MoveMask</code> intrinsic.<br>
The goal here is to generate a <strong>scalar</strong> <code>mask</code> value, that contains a single <code>1</code> bit for every comparison where the corresponding data element was <em>greater-than</em> the pivot value and <code>0</code> bits for all others. If you are having a hard time following <em>why</em> this does this, you need to head back to the <a href="https://bits.houmus.org/2020-01-29/this-goes-to-eleven-pt2">2<sup>nd</sup> post</a> and read up on these two intrinsics/watch their animations.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>L9-10</span></p>
<p>Permute the loaded data according to a permutation vector; A-ha! A twist in the plot!<br>
<code>mask</code> contains 8 bits, from LSB to MSB describing where each element belongs to (left/right). We could, of course, loop over those bits and perform 8 branches to determine which side each element belongs to, but that would be a terrible mistake. Instead, we‚Äôre going to use the <code>mask</code> as an <em>index</em> into a lookup-table for permutation values!<br>
This is one of the reasons it was critical to use <code>MoveMask</code> in the first place. Without it, we would not have a scalar value we could use as an index to our table. Pretty neat, no?<br>
With the permutation operation done, we‚Äôve grouped all the <em>smaller-or-equal</em> than values on one side of our <code>dataVec</code> vector (the ‚Äúleft‚Äù side) and all the <em>greater-than</em> values on the other side (the ‚Äúright‚Äù side).<br>
I‚Äôve comfortably glanced over the actual values in the permutation lookup-table which <code>PermTablePtr</code> is pointing to; I‚Äôll address this a couple of paragraphs below.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

  <p>Partitioning is now practically complete: That is, our <code>dataVec</code> vector is neatly partitioned. Except that that data is still ‚Äústuck‚Äù inside our vector. We need to write its contents back to memory. Here comes a small complication: Our <code>dataVec</code> vector now contains values belonging <em>both</em> to the left and right sides of the original array. We did separate them <strong>within</strong> the vector, but we‚Äôre not done until each side is written back to memory, on both ends of our array.</p>

  <div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>L11-12</span></p>
<p>Store the permuted vector to both sides of the array. There is no cheap way to write <em>portions</em> of a vector to each respective end, so we write the <strong>entire</strong> partitioned vector to both the <em>left</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>right</em> sides of the array.<br>
At any given moment, we have two write pointers pointing to where we need to write to <strong>next</strong> on either side: <code>writeLeft</code> and <code>writeRight</code>. How those are initialized and maintained will be dealt with further down where we start calling this block, but for now, let‚Äôs assume these pointers initially point to somewhere where it is <strong>safe</strong> to write <em>at least</em> an entire <code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code> and move on.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>L13-15</span></p>
<p>Book-keeping time: We just wrote 8 elements to each side, and each side had a trail of unwanted data tacked to it. We didn‚Äôt care for it while we were writing it, because we knew we‚Äôre about to update the same write pointers in such a way that the <em>next</em> writes operations will <strong>overwrite</strong> the trailing/unwanted data that doesn‚Äôt belong to each respective side!<br>
The vector gods are smiling at us: We have the <code>PopCount</code> intrinsic to lend us a hand here. We issue <code>PopCount</code> on the same <code>mask</code> variable (again, <code>MoveMask</code> was worth its weight in gold here) and get a count of how many bits in <code>mask</code> were <code>1</code>. This accounts for how many values <strong>inside</strong> the vector were <em>greater-than</em> the pivot value and belong to the right side.<br>
This ‚Äúhappens‚Äù to be the amount by which we want to <em>decrease</em> the <code>writeRight</code> pointer (<code>writeRight</code> is ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù by decrementing it, this may seem weird for now, but will become clearer when we discuss the outer-loop!<br>
Finally, we adjust the <code>writeLeft</code> pointer: <code>popCount</code> contains the number of <code>1</code> bits; the number of <code>0</code> bits is by definition, <code>8 - popCount</code> since <code>mask</code> had 8 bits of content in it, to begin with. This accounts for how many values in the register were <em>less-than-or-equal</em> the pivot value and grouped on the left side of the register.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

  <p>This was a full 8-element wise partitioning block, and it‚Äôs worth noting a thing or two about it:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It is completely branch-less(!): We‚Äôve given the CPU a nice juicy block with no need to speculate on what code gets executed next. It sure looks pretty when you consider the number of branches our scalar code would execute for the same amount of work. Don‚Äôt pop a champagne bottle quite yet though, we‚Äôre about to run into a wall full of thorny branches in a second, but sure feels good for now.</li>
    <li>If we want to execute multiple copies of this block, the main dependency from one block to the next is the mutation of the <code>writeLeft</code> and <code>writeRight</code> pointers. It‚Äôs unavoidable given we set-out to perform in-place sorting (well, I couldn‚Äôt avoid it, maybe you can!), but worth-while mentioning nonetheless. If you need a reminder about how these data-dependencies can change the dynamics of efficient execution, you can read up on when I tried my best to go at it battling with <a href="https://bits.houmus.org/2018-08-20/netcoreapp3.0-intrinsics-in-real-life-pt3"><code>PopCount</code> to run screaming fast</a>; If nothing else, you‚Äôll get a clearer understanding of how the CPU extracts data-flows from our code.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I thought it would be nice to wrap up the discussion of this block by showing off that the JIT is relatively well-behaved in this case with the generated x64 asm:<br>
Anyone who has followed the C# code can use the intrinsics table from the previous post and read the assembly code without further help. Also, it becomes clear how this is a 1:1 translation of C# code. Congratulations: It‚Äôs 2020, and we‚Äôre x86 assembly programmers again!</p>

<h2 id="permutation-lookup-table">Permutation lookup table</h2>

<p>If you made it this far, you are owed an explanation of the permutation lookup table. Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs in it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The table needs to have 2<sup>8</sup> elements for all possible mask values.</li>
  <li>Each element ultimately needs to be a <code>Vector256&lt;int&gt;</code> because that‚Äôs what the permutation intrinsic expects from us, so 8 x 4 bytes = 32 bytes per element.
    <ul>
      <li>That‚Äôs a whopping 8kb of lookup data in total (!).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The values inside are <a href="https://github.com/damageboy/VxSort/blob/research/TestBlog/PermutationTableTests.cs#L20">pre-generated</a> so that they would reorder the data <em>inside</em> a <code>Vector256&lt;int&gt;</code> according to our wishes: all values that got a corresponding <code>1</code> bit in the mask go to one side (right side), and the elements with a <code>0</code> go to the other side (left side). There‚Äôs no particular required order amongst the grouped elements since we‚Äôre merely partitioning around a pivot value, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are 4 sample values from the generated permutation table that I‚Äôve copy-pasted so we can get a feel for it:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>For <code>mask</code> values 0, 255 the entries are trivial: All <code>mask</code> bits were either <code>1</code> or <code>0</code> so there‚Äôs nothing we need to do with the data, we just leave it as is, the ‚Äúnull‚Äù permutation vector: <code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]</code> achieves just that.</li>
    <li>When <code>mask</code> is <code>0b00000111</code> (decimal 7), the 3 lowest bits of the <code>mask</code> are <code>1</code>, they represent elements that need to go to the right side of the vector (e.g., elements that were <code>&gt; pivot</code>), while all other values need to go to the left (<code>&lt;= pivot</code>). The permutation vector: <code>[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]</code> does just that.</li>
    <li>The checkered bit pattern for the <code>mask</code> value <code>0b10101010</code> (decimal 170) calls to move all the even elements to one side and the odd elements to the other‚Ä¶ You can see that <code>[0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7]</code> does the work here.</li>

<td><p>The permutation table signature provided here is technically a lie: The <a href="https://github.com/damageboy/VxSort/blob/research/VxSortResearch/PermutationTables/Int32PermTables.cs#L12">actual code</a> uses <code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;byte&gt;</code> as the table‚Äôs type, with the <code>int</code> values encoded as individual bytes in little-endian encoding. This is a C# 7.3 specific optimization where we get to treat the address of this table as a constant at JIT time. Kevin Jones (<a href="https://twitter.com/vcsjones">@vcsjones</a>) did a wonderful job of <a href="https://vcsjones.dev/2019/02/01/csharp-readonly-span-bytes-static/">digging into it</a>.<br>
We <strong>must</strong> use a <code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;byte&gt;</code> for the optimization to trigger: Not reading <em>that</em> fine-print cost me two nights of my life chasing what I was <em>sure</em> had to be a GC/JIT bug. Normally, it would be a <strong>bad</strong> idea to store a <code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;int&gt;</code> as a <code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;byte&gt;</code>: we are forced to choose between little/big-endian encoding <em>at compile-time</em>. This runs up against the fact that in C# we compile once and debug (and occasionally run :) everywhere. Therefore, we have to <em>assume</em> our binaries might run on both little/big-endian machines where the CPU might not match the encoding we chose.<br>
<strong>In this case</strong>, praise the vector deities, blessed be their name and all that they touch, this is a <em>non-issue</em>: The entire premise is <strong>x86</strong> specific. This means that this code will <strong>never</strong> run on a big-endian machine. We can simply assume little endianness here till the end of all times.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve covered the basic layout of the permutation table. We‚Äôll go back to it once we start optimization efforts in earnest on the 4<sup>th</sup> post, but for now, we can move on to the loop surrounding our vectorized partition block.</p>

<h2 id="double-pumped-loop">Double Pumped Loop</h2>

<p>Armed with a vectorized partitioning block, it‚Äôs time to hammer our unsorted array with it, but there‚Äôs a wrinkle: In-place sorting. This brings a new challenge to the table: If you followed the previous section carefully, you might have noticed it already. For every <code>Vector256&lt;int&gt;</code> we read, we ended up writing that same vector twice to both ends of the array. You don‚Äôt have to be a math wizard to figure out that if we end up writing 16 elements for every 8 we read, that doesn‚Äôt sound very in-placy, to begin with. Moreover, this extra writing would have to overwrite data that we have <em>not read yet</em>.<br>
Initially, it would seem, we‚Äôve managed to position ourselves between a rock and a hard place.</p>

<p>But all is not lost! In reality, we immediately adjust the next write positions on both sides in such a way that their <strong>sum</strong> advances by 8. In other words, we are at risk of overwriting unread data only temporarily while we store the data back. I ended up adopting a tricky approach: We will need to continuously make sure we have at least 8 elements (the size of our block) of free space on <em>both</em> sides of the array so we could, in turn, perform a full, efficient 8-element write to both ends without overwriting a single bit of data we haven‚Äôt read yet.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a visual representation of the mental model I was in while debugging/making this work (I‚Äôll note I had the same facial expressions as this poor Charmander while writing and debugging that code):</p>

<p>Funny, right? It‚Äôs closer to what I actually do than I‚Äôd like to admit! I fondly named this approach in my code as ‚Äúdouble-pumped partitioning‚Äù. It pumps values in-to/out-of <strong>both</strong> ends of the array at all times. I‚Äôve left it pretty much intact in the repo under the name <a href="https://github.com/damageboy/VxSort/blob/research/VxSortResearch/Unstable/AVX2/Happy/00_DoublePumpNaive.cs"><code>DoublePumpNaive</code></a>, in case you want to dig through the full code. Like all good things in life, it comes in 3-parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prime the pump (make some initial room inside the array).</li>
  <li>Loop over the data in 8-element chunks executing our vectorized code block.</li>
  <li>Finally, go over the last remaining data elements (e.g. the last remaining <code>&lt; 8</code> block of unpartitioned data) and partition them using scalar code. This is a very common and unfortunate pattern we find in vectorized code, as we need to finish off with just a bit of scalar work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with another visual aid I ended up doing to better explain this; note the different color codes and legend I‚Äôve provided here, and try to watch a few loops noticing the various color transitions, this will become useful as you parse the text and code below:</p>

<div>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Each rectangle is 8-elements wide.
      <ul>
        <li>Except for the middle one, which represents the last group of up to 8 elements that need to be partitioned. This is often called in vectorized parlance the ‚Äúremainder problem‚Äù.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We want to partition the entire array, in-place, or turn it from <span>orange</span> into the green/red colors:
      <ul>
        <li><span>Green</span>: for smaller-than-or-equal to the pivot values, on the left side.</li>
        <li><span>Red</span>: for greater-than-or-equal the pivot values, on the right side.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Initially we ‚Äúprime the pump‚Äù, or make some room inside the array, by partitioning into some temporary memory, marked as the 3x8-element blocks in <span>purple</span>:
      <ul>
        <li>We allocate this temporary space somewhere on the stack; We‚Äôll discuss why this isn‚Äôt really a big deal below.</li>
        <li>We read one vector‚Äôs worth of elements from the left and execute our partitioning block into the temporary space.</li>
        <li>We repeat the process for the right side.</li>
        <li>At this stage, one vector on each edge has already been partitioned, and their color is now <span>gray</span>, which represents data/area within our array we can freely <em>write</em> into.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>From here-on, we‚Äôre in the main loop: this could go on for millions of iterations, even though in this animation we only see 4 iterations in total:
      <ul>
        <li>In every round, we <em>choose</em> where we read from next: From the left <em>-or-</em> right side of the <span>orange</span> area?<br>
How? Easy-peasy: Whichever side has a <strong>smaller</strong> <span>gray</span> area!
          <ul>
            <li><em>Intuition</em>: The gray area represents the distance between the head (read) and tail (write) pointers we set up for each side, the smaller the distance/area is, the more likely that our next 8-element partition <em>might</em> end with us overwriting that side‚Äôs head with the tail.</li>
            <li><strong>We really don‚Äôt want that to happen‚Ä¶</strong></li>
            <li>We read from the only side <em>where this might happen next</em>, thereby adding 8 more elements of breathing space to that side just in time before we cause a meltdown. (you can see this clearly in the animation as each orange block turns gray <em>after</em> we read it, <em>but before</em> we write to both sides‚Ä¶)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We partition the data inside the <code>Vector256&lt;int&gt;</code> we just read and write it to the next write position on each side.</li>
        <li>We advance each write pointer according to how much of that register was red/green, we‚Äôve discussed the how of it when we toured the vectorized block. Here you can see the end result reflected in how the red portion of the written copy on the left-hand side turns into gray, and the green portion on the right-hand side turns into gray correspondingly.<br>
<strong>Remember</strong>: We‚Äôve seen the code in detail when we previously discussed the partitioning block; I repeat it here since it is critical for understanding how the whole process clicks together.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For the finishing touch:
      <ul>
        <li>Left with less than 8 elements, we partition with plain old scalar code the few remaining elements, into the temporary memory area again.</li>
        <li>We copy back each side of the temporary area back to the main array, and we‚Äôre done!</li>
        <li>We move the pivot value that was left untouched all this time on the right edge of our segment and move it to where the new boundary is.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Let‚Äôs go over it again, in more detail, this time with code:</p>
</div>

<h3 id="setup-make-some-room">Setup: Make some room!</h3>

<p>What I eventually opted for was to read from <em>one</em> area and write to <em>another</em> area in the same array. But we need to make some spare room inside the array for this. How?</p>

<p>We cheat! (¬Ø\<em>(„ÉÑ)</em>/¬Ø), but not really: we allocate some temporary space on stack, by using the relatively new <code>ref struct</code> feature in C# in combination with <code>fixed</code> arrays, here‚Äôs why this isn‚Äôt really cheating in any reasonable person‚Äôs book:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stack allocation doesn‚Äôt put pressure on the GC, and its allocation is super fast/slim.</li>
  <li>We allocate <em>once</em> at the top of our entire sort operation and reuse that space while recursing.</li>
  <li>‚ÄúJust a bit‚Äù is really just a bit: For our 8-element partition block we need room for 1 x 8-elements vector on <strong>each</strong> side of the array, so we allocate a total of 2 x 8 integers. In addition, we allocate 8 more elements for handling the remainder (well technically, 7 would be enough, but I‚Äôm not a monster, I like round numbers just like the next person), so a total of 96 bytes. Not too horrid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here‚Äôs the signature + setup code:</p>

  <p>The function accepts two parameters: <code>left</code>, <code>right</code> pointing to the edges of the partitioning task we were handed. The selected pivot is ‚Äúpassed‚Äù in an unconventional way: the caller (The top-level sort function) is responsible for <strong>moving</strong> it to the right edge of the array before calling the partitioning function. In other words, we start executing the function expecting the pivot to be already selected and placed at the right edge of the segment (e.g., <code>right</code> points to it). This is a remnant of my initial copy-pasting of CoreCLR code, and to be honest, I don‚Äôt care enough to change it.</p>

  <table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><span>Note</span></td>
<td><p>I‚Äôm using a ‚Äúvariable‚Äù (<code>N</code>) instead of <code>Vector256&lt;int&gt;.Count</code>. There‚Äôs a reason for those double quotes: At JIT time, the right-hand expression is considered as a constant as far as the JIT is concerned. Furthermore, once we initialize N with its value and <em>never</em> modify it, the JIT treats N as a constant as well! So really, I get to use a short/readable name and pay no penalty in for it.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

  <p>We start by setting up various pointers we‚Äôll be using: Thw <code>writeLeft</code> and <code>writeRight</code> pointers pointing into the internal edges of our array (excluding the last element which is pointing to the selected pivot), while the <code>tmpLeft</code> and <code>tmpRight</code> pointers are pointing into the internal edges of the temporary space.<br>
One recurring pattern is that the right-side pointers are pointing on vector‚Äôs worth on elements <strong>left</strong> of their respective edge. This makes sense given that we will be using vectorized write operations that take a pointer to memory and write 8 elements at a time; the pointers are setup accounting for that assymetry.</p>

  <p>We proceed to partition a single 8-element vector on each side, with our good-ole‚Äô partitioning block <strong>straight into</strong> that temporary space through the pointers we just setup. It is important to remember that having done that, we don‚Äôt care about the original contents of the area we just read from anymore: we‚Äôre free to write up to one <code>Vector256&lt;T&gt;</code> to each edge of the array in the future. We‚Äôve made enough room inside our array available for writing in-place while partitioning.</p>

  <p>We finish the setup by initializing read pointers for every side (<code>readLeft</code>, <code>readRight</code>); An alternative way to think about these pointers is that each side gets its own head (read) and tail (write) pointers. We will be continuously reading from <strong>one</strong> of the heads and writing to <strong>both</strong> tails from now on.</p>

  <p>The setup ends with <code>readLeft</code> pointing a single <code>Vector256&lt;int&gt;</code> <em>right</em> of <code>left</code> , and <code>readRight</code> pointing 1 element + 2x<code>Vector256&lt;int&gt;</code> <em>left</em> of <code>right</code>. The setup of <code>readRight</code> might initially seem peculiar, but easily explained:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>right</code> itself points to the selected pivot; we‚Äôre not going to (re-)partition it, so we skip that element (this explains the <code>- 1</code>).</li>
    <li>As with the <code>tmpRight</code> and <code>writeWrite</code> pointers, when we read/write using <code>Avx2.LoadDquVector256</code>/<code>Avx.Store</code> we always have to supply the <em>start</em> address to read from or write to!<br>
Since There is no ability to read/write to the ‚Äúleft‚Äù of the pointer, we pre-decrement that pointer by <code>2*N</code> to account for the data that was already partitioned and to prepare it for the next read.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <p>This is the heart of the partitioning operation and where we spend most of the time sorting the array. Looks quite boring, eh?</p>

  <p>This loop is all about calling our good ole‚Äô partitioning block on the entire array. We-reuse the same block, but here, for the first time, actually use it as an in-place partitioning block, since we are both reading and writing to the same array.
While the runtime of the loop is dominated by the partitioning block, the interesting bit is that beefy condition on <span>L3</span> that we described/animated before: it calculates the distance between each head and tail on both sides and compares them to determine which side has less space left, or which side is closer to being overwritten. Given that the <strong>next</strong> read will happen from the side we choose here, we‚Äôve just added 8 more integers worth of <em>writing</em> space to that same endangered side, thereby eliminating the risk of overwriting.<br>
While it might be easy to read in terms of correctness or motivation, this is a very <em>sad line of code</em>, as it will haunt us in the next posts!</p>

  <p>Finally, as we exit the loop once there are <code>&lt; 8</code> elements left (remember that we pre-decremented <code>readRight</code> by <code>N</code> elements before the loop), we are done with all vectorized work for this partitioning call. as such, this is as good a time to re-adjust both <code>readRight</code> and <code>tmpRight</code> that were pre-decremented by <code>N</code> elements to make them ready-to-go for using <code>Avx.Store</code> back in preparation for the final step.</p>

  <p>Finally, we come out of the loop once we have less than 8-elements to partition (1-7 elements). We can‚Äôt use vectorized code here, so we drop to plain-old scalar partitioning. To keep things simple, we partition these last elements straight into the temporary area. This is the reason we‚Äôre allocating 8 more elements in the temporary area in the first place.</p>

  <p>Once we‚Äôre done with this remainder nuisance, we copy back the already partitioned data from the temporary area back into the array to the area left between <code>writeLeft</code> and <code>writeRight</code>, it‚Äôs a quick 64-96 byte copy in two operations, and we are nearly done. We still need to move the pivot <em>back</em> to the newly calculated pivot position (remember the caller placed it on the right edge of the array as part of pivot selection) and report this position back as the return value for this to be officially be christened as AVX2 partitioning function.</p>

  <p>Most of this is pretty dull code:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We start with a top-level static class <code>DoublePumpNaive</code> containing a single <code>Sort</code> entry point accepting a normal managed array.</li>
    <li>We special case, relying on generic type elision, for  <code>typeof(int)</code>, newing up a <code>VxSortInt32</code> struct and finally calling its internal <code>.Sort()</code> method to initiate the recursive sorting.
      <ul>
        <li>This is a good time as any to remind, again, that for the time being, I only implemented vectorized sorting when <code>T</code> is <code>int</code>. To fully replace <code>Array.Sort()</code> more tweaked versions of this code will have to be written to eventually support unsigned integers, both larger and smaller than 32 bits as well as floating-point types.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Continuing on to <code>VxSortInt32</code> itself:</p>

  <p>This is where the real top-level sorting entry point for 32-bit signed integers is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>This struct contains a bunch of constants and members that are initialized for a single sort-job/call and immediately discarded once sorting is complete.</li>
    <li>There‚Äôs a little semingly nasty bit hiding in plain sight there, where we exfiltrate an interior pointer obtained inside a <code>fixed</code> block and store it for the lifetime of the struct, outside of the <code>fixed</code> block.
      <ul>
        <li>This is generally a no-no, since, in theory, we don‚Äôt have a guarantee that the struct won‚Äôt be boxed/stored inside a managed object on a heap where the GC is free to move our memory around.</li>
        <li>In this case, we <em>are ensuring</em> that instances of <code>VxSortInt32</code> are never promoted to the managed heap by declaring it as a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/ref#ref-struct-types"><code>ref struct</code></a>.</li>
        <li>The motivation behind this is to ensure that the <code>fixed</code> temporary memory resides close to the other struct fields, taking advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference">locality of reference</a>.</li>

<p>Lastly, we have the <code>Sort</code> method for the <code>VxSortInt32</code> struct. Most of this is code I blatantly copied for <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/Collections/Generic/ArraySortHelper.cs#L182"><code>ArraySortHelper&lt;T&gt;</code></a>. What it does is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Special case for lengths of 0-3.</li>
  <li>When length <code>&lt;= 16</code> we just go straight to <code>InsertionSort</code> and skip all the recursive jazz (go back to post 1 if you want to know why <code>Array.Sort()</code> does this).</li>
  <li>When we have <code>&gt;= 17</code> elements, we go to vectorized partitioning:
    <ul>
      <li>We do median of 3 pivot selection.</li>
      <li>Swap that pivot so that it resides on the right-most index of the partition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Call <code>VectorizedPartitionInPlace</code>, which we‚Äôve seen before.
    <ul>
      <li>We conveniently take advantage of the fact we have <code>InsertionSort</code> to cover us for the small partitions, and our partitioning code can always assume that it can prime the pump with at least two vectors worth of vectorized partitioning without additional checks‚Ä¶</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Recurse to the left.</li>
  <li>Recurse to the right.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="initial-performance">Initial Performance</h2>

<p>Are we fast yet?</p>

<p>Yes! This is by no means the end, on the contrary, this is only a rather impressive beginning. We finally have something working, and it is even not entirely unpleasant, if I may say so:</p>

  <p>We‚Äôre off to a very good start:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>We can see that as soon as we hit 1000 element arrays (even earlier, in earnest), we already outperform <code>Array.Sort</code> (87% runtime), and by the time we get to 1M / 10M element arrays, we see speed-ups north of 2.5x (39%, 37% runtime) over the scalar C++ code!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>While <code>Array.Sort</code> is behaving like we would expect from a <code>QuickSort</code>-like function: it is slowing down at rate you‚Äôd expect given that it has a Big-O notation of , our own <code>DoublePumpedNaive</code> is peculiar: The time spent sorting every single element starts going up as we increase <code>N</code>, then goes down a bit and back up. Huh? It actually improves as we sort more data? Quite unreasonable, unless we remind ourselves that we are executing a mix of scalar insertion sort and vectorized code. Where are we actually spending more CPU cycles though?  We‚Äôll run some profiling sessions in a minute, to get a better idea of what‚Äôs going on.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you recall, on the first post in this series, I presented some statistics about is going on inside our sort routine. This is a perfect time to switch to the statistics tab, where I‚Äôve beefed up the table with some vectorized counters that didn‚Äôt make sense before with the scalar version. From here we can learn a few interesting facts:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The number of partitioning operations / small sorts is practically the same
      <ul>
        <li>You could ask yourself, or me, why they are not <strong>exactly</strong> the same?
To which I‚Äôd answer:
          <ul>
            <li>The thresholds are 16 vs. 17, which has some effect.</li>
            <li>We have to remember that the resulting partitions from each implementation end up looking slightly different because of the double pumping + temporary memory shenanigans. Once the partitions look different, the following pivots selected are different, and the entire whole sort mechanic looks slightly different.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We are doing a lot of vectorized work:
      <ul>
        <li>Loading two vectors per 8-element(1 data vector + 1 permutation vector)</li>
        <li>Storing two vectors (left+right) for every vector read</li>
        <li>In a weird coincidence, this means we perform the same number of vectorized loads and stores for every test case.<br>
In future posts, I will discard one of these columns to reduce the amount of information load‚Ä¶</li>
        <li>Finally, lest we forget, we perfom compares/permutations at exactly half of the load/store rate.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>All of this is helping us by reducing the number of scalar comparisons, but there‚Äôs still quite a lot of it left too:
      <ul>
        <li>We continue to do scalar partitioning inside <code>VectorizedPartitionInPlace</code>, as part of handling the remainder that doesn‚Äôt fit into a <code>Vector256&lt;int&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li>We are still executing scalar comparisons as part of small-sorting/inside of the insertion sort at an alarming rate:
          <ul>
            <li>The absolute number of comparisons is quite high: We‚Äôre still doing millions of data-based branches.</li>
            <li>It is also clear from the counters that the overwhelming majority of these are from <code>InsertionSort</code>: If we focus on the 1M/10M cases here,    we see that <code>InsertionSort</code> went up from attributing 28.08%/24.60% of scalar comparisons in the <code>Unmanaged</code> (scalar) test-case all the way to 66.4%/62.74% in the vectorized <code>DoublePumpNaive</code> version. Of course this rise is merely in percent terms, but clearly we will have to deal with this if we intend to make this thing fast(er).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is but the beginning of our profiling journey, but we are already learning a complicated truth: Right now, as fast as this is already going, the scalar code we use for insertion sort will always put an upper limit on how fast we can possibly go by optimizing the <em>vectorized code</em> we‚Äôve gone over so far, <em>unless</em> we get rid of <code>InsertionSort</code> alltogether, replacing it with something better. But first thing‚Äôs first, we must remain focused: 65% of instructions executed are still spent doing vectorized partitioning; That is the biggest target on our scope!</p>
</div>

<p>As promised, it‚Äôs time we profile the code to see what‚Äôs really up: We can fire up the venerable Linux <code>perf</code> tool, through a simple test binary/project I‚Äôve coded up which allows me to execute some dummy sorting by selecting the sort method I want to invoke and specify some parameters for it through the command line, for example:</p>

<p>Here we call the <code>DoublePumpedNaive</code> implementation we‚Äôve been discussing from the beginning of this post with 1M elements, and sort the random data 100 times to generate some heat in case global warming is not cutting it for you.<br>
I know that calling <code>dotnet publish ...</code> seems superfluous, but trust<sup id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup> me and go with me on this one:</p>

<p>This is a trimmed summary of <code>perf</code> session recording performance metrics, specifically: number of instructions executed for running a 1M element sort 100 times, followed by running a 10K element sort, 10K times. I was shocked when I saw this for the first time, but we‚Äôre starting to understand the previous oddities we saw with the <code>Time/N</code> column!<br>
We‚Äôre spending upwards of 20% of our time doing scalar insertion sorting! I lured you here with promises of vectorized sorting and yet, somehow, ‚Äúonly‚Äù 65% of the time is spent in doing ‚Äúvectorized‚Äù work (which also has some scalar partitioning, if we‚Äôre honest). Not only that, but as the size of the array decreases, the percentage of time spent in scalar code <em>increases</em> (from 22.43% to 29.87%), which should not surprise us anymore.<br>
Before anything else, let me clearly state that this is not necessarily a bad thing! As the size of the partition decreases, the <em>benefit</em> of doing vectorized partitioning decreases in general, and even more so for our AVX2 partitioning, which has non-trivial start-up overhead. We shouldn‚Äôt care about the amount of time we‚Äôre spending on scalar code per se, but the amount of time taken to sort the entire array.<br>
The decision to go to with scalar insertion-sort or stick to vectorized code is controlled by the threshold I mentioned before, which is still sitting there at <code>16</code>. We‚Äôre only beginning our optimization phase in the next post, so for now, we‚Äôll stick with the threshold selected for <code>Array.Sort</code> by the CoreCLR developers, this is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù starting point both in terms of allowing us to compare apples-to-apples and also as I am a firm believer at doing very incremental modifications for this sort of work.<br>
Having said that, this is definitely something we will tweak later for our particular implementation.</p>

<h2 id="finishing-off-with-a-sour-taste">Finishing off with a sour taste</h2>

<p>I‚Äôll end this post with a not so easy pill to swallow: let‚Äôs re-run <code>perf</code> and measure a different aspect of our code: Let‚Äôs see how the code is behaving in terms of top-level performance counters. The idea here is to use counters that our CPU is already capable of collecting at the hardware level, with almost no performance impact, to see where/if we‚Äôre hurting. What I‚Äôll do before invoking <code>perf</code> is use a Linux utility called <a href="https://github.com/lpechacek/cpuset"><code>cset</code></a> which can be <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/13076880/9172">used to</a> evacuate all user threads and (almost all) kernel threads from a given physical CPU core, using <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/cpusets.rst">cpusets</a>:</p>

<p>Once we have ‚Äúshielded‚Äù a single CPU core, we execute the <code>Example</code> binary we used before much in the same way while collecting different top-level hardware statistics from befre using a the following <code>perf</code> command line:</p>

<p>I‚Äôm purposely showing only the statistics collected for our shielded core since we know we only care about that core in the first place.</p>

<p>Here are some bad news: core #3 is really not having a good time running our code. <code>perf --topdown</code> is essentially screaming from the top of its lungs with that <code>32.3%</code> under the <code>bad speculation</code> column. This might seem like an innocent metric if you haven‚Äôt done this sort of thing before (in which case, read the info box below), but this is <strong>really bad</strong>. In plain English and <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/02/09/Top-Down-performance-analysis-methodology">without getting into the intricacies of top-down perfromance analysis</a>, this metric represents cycles where the CPU isn‚Äôt doing useful work because of an earlier mis-speculation. Here, the mis-speculation is mis-predicted branches. The penalty for <em>each</em> such mis-predicted branch is an entire flush of the pipeline (hence the wasted time), which costs us around 14-15 cycles on modern Intel CPUs.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><span>Note</span></td>
<td><p>We have to remember that efficient execution on modern CPUs means keeping the CPU pipeline as busy as possible; This is quite a challenge given its length is about 15 stages, and the CPU itself is super-scalar (For example: an <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/microarchitectures/skylake_(client)#Individual_Core">Intel Skylake CPU has 8 ports</a> that can execute some instruction every cycle!). If, for example, all instructions in the CPU have a constant latency in cycles, this means it <em>has</em> to process 100+ instructions into ‚Äúthe future‚Äù while it‚Äôs just finishing up with a current one to avoid doing nothing. That‚Äôs enough of a challenge for regular code, but what should it do when it sees a branch? It could attempt and execute <strong>both</strong> branches, which quickly becomes a fool‚Äôs errand if somewhere close-by there would be even more branches. What CPU designers did was opt for speculative execution: add complex machinery to <em>predict</em> if a branch will be taken and speculatively execute the next instruction according to the prediction. But the predictor isn‚Äôt all knowing, and it will mis-predict, and then we end up paying a huge penalty: The CPU will have to push those mis-predicted instructions through the pipeline flushing the results out as if the whole thing never happenned. This is why the rate of mis-prediction is a life and death matter when it comes to performance.</p>

<p>Wait, I sense some optimistic thoughts all across the internet‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs not our precious vectorized so-called branch-less code? Maybe we can chalk it all up on that mean scalar <code>InsertionSort</code> function doing those millions and millions of scalar comparisons? We are, after all, using it for sorting small partitions, which we‚Äôve already measured at more than 20% of the total run-time? Let‚Äôs see this again with <code>perf</code>, <em>this time</em> focusing on the <code>branch-misses</code> HW counter and try to figure out how the mis-predictions are distributed amongst our call-stacks:</p>

<p>No such luck. While <code>InsertionSort</code> is definitely starring here with 41% <em>of the</em> branch misprediction events, we still have <strong>32%</strong> of the bad speculation coming from our own new vectorized code. This is a red-flag as far as we‚Äôre concerned: It means that our vectorized code still contains a lot of mis-predicted branches. Given that we‚Äôre in the bussiness of sorting (random data) and the high rate of recorded mis-prediction the only logical conclusion is that we have branches that are data-dependent. Another thing to keep in mind is that the resulting pipeline flush is a large penalty to pay given that our entire 8-element partition block has a throughput of around 8-9 cycles. That means we are hitting that 15 cycle pan-to-the-face way too often to feel good about ourselves.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll finish this post here. We have a <strong>lot of work</strong> cut out for us. This is no-where near over.<br>
In the next post, I‚Äôll try to give the current vectorized code a good shakeup. After all, it‚Äôs still our biggest target in terms of number of instructions executed, and 2<sup>nd</sup> when it comes to branch mis-predictions. Once we finish squeezing that lemon for all its performance juice on the 4<sup>th</sup> post, We will turn our focus to the <code>InsertionSort</code> function on the 5<sup>th</sup> post , and we‚Äôll see if we can appease the performance gods to make that part of the sorting effort faster.<br>
In the meantime, you can go back to the vectorized partitioning function and try to figure out what is causing all those nasty branch mis-predictions if you‚Äôre up for a small challenge. We‚Äôll be dealing with it head-on in the next post.</p>
