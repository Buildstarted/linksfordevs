<p><strong>3 days </strong>training, by <strong>Nicolas Gr√©goire</strong></p>
<p>This training will be given in <strong><span>ENGLISH</span></strong></p>
<p>Price: <strong><span>CHF</span> 2250.-&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>DESCRIPTION</span></span></strong></p>
<p>As nicely said in PoC||<span>GTFO</span> Volume <span>II</span>, ¬´ This is not a&nbsp;book about astronomy; rather, this is a&nbsp;book about telescopes ¬ª. In the same spirit, this training isn‚Äôt about Web hacking. Instead, this training is for Web hackers who want to master their toolbox. Burp Suite Pro is the leading tool for auditing Web applications at large, but also a&nbsp;complex beast where new features get added every few weeks. Mastering Burp Suite Pro, including its newest features, allows testers to get the most out of the tool, optimizing time spent auditing and testing. Work will be faster (hotkeys!) and much more efficient (more tools, more possibilities!). Attendees will also learn to measure and assess the quality of their attacks, a&nbsp;crucial skill in real-life engagements that can make the difference between a&nbsp;false-negative and a&nbsp;critical finding.</p>

<p>Normal price: <strong><span>CHF</span> 1500.-<br>
</strong>Student price: <strong><span>CHF</span> 800.-<br>
</strong>Special student price (Dipl√¥me f√©d√©ral, <span>MAS</span> <span>MSSI</span>, <span>MAS</span> Infosec):<strong> <span>CHF</span> 1200.-&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>DESCRIPTION</span></strong></span></p>
<p>This training familiarizes developers and security professionals of any level with modern cryptography concepts and best practices. It covers basic notions, including randomness generation, authenticated encryption, and elliptic curves, as well as applications like <span>TLS</span> 1.3, password security protocols, libraries and APIs, and software side-channel attacks. Finally, our training offers an overview of advanced topics including post-quantum cryptography.</p>
<p>We have given cryptography trainings since 2013, and over the years have kept improving our content and format for an optimal learning experience. We strive to make cryptography more approachable and less abstract than in typical teaching material.</p>
<p>The class is</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice-oriented: Lectures present real-world failures and by analyze how they could have been avoided, and exercise sessions consist of a&nbsp;mix of made-up problems and examples of real vulnerabilities found in widely deployed systems.</li>
<li>New and unique: We are closely involved in the latest developments in cryptography, and regularly integrate new content into our trainings to follow the latest innovations and applications. Each training session therefore includes fresh and updated content.</li>
<li>Interactive: We encourage participants to ask questions about the topics presented or even other topics, which usually leads to interesting discussions.</li>
<li>Previous versions of this training were given at events including Black Hat Europe, Troopers, and in private sessions for organizations including Google and Facebook.</li>

<p><span><strong><span>CLASS</span> <span>REQUIREMENTS</span></strong></span><br> This training is suitable to any security professional or security-minded developer who has at least some basic understanding of cryptography. You should know the difference between public-key cryptography and secret-key cryptography, but you don't need to know the maths behind. We expect participants to be familiar with basic programming concepts, and it's recommended to be familiar with C&nbsp;and Python syntax, since many exercises are in one of these languages.<br>

<p><span><strong><span>DESCRIPTION</span></strong></span></p>
<p>Approaching IoT devices from a&nbsp;security assessment standpoint can be intimidating, especially when you need to work hands-on with hardware but fear not! This is the training for you, if you want to take your first steps into how to discover vulnerabilities in smart devices: homes, cars, routers, <span>PLC</span>‚Äôs, medical equipment and other IoT devices.</p>
<p>We will guide you through systematic analysis of IoT devices to identify vulnerabilities. You will interact directly with hardware interfaces, and become comfortable with using the hardware and software tools of the trade to evaluate IoT devices and their firmware. After having played with different devices, you will have a&nbsp;chance to apply your newly learned skills conducting a&nbsp;penetration test against a&nbsp;smart home.</p>
<p>After the training, you will be able to understand the hardware and software attack surface of IoT devices to help them get more secure. Going forward you will tackle the most common situations confidently, including when the firmware is not publicly available. This training is for security professionals and/or <span>CTF</span> enthusiasts who want to improve their pwning skills.</p>

<p><strong>2 days</strong> training, by <strong>Abhinav Singh</strong></p>
<p>This training will be given in <strong><span>ENGLISH</span></strong></p>
<p>Normal price: <strong><span>CHF</span> 1500.-<br>
</strong>Student price: <strong><span>CHF</span> 800.-<br>
</strong>Special student price (Dipl√¥me f√©d√©ral, <span>MAS</span> <span>MSSI</span>, <span>MAS</span> Infosec):<strong> <span>CHF</span> 1200.-&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>DESCRIPTION</span></strong></span></p>
<p>This training focuses on elevating your malware analysis, forensic investigations, and incident response knowledge into the cloud. The hands-on training focuses on building a&nbsp;fully automated malware analysis, threat intelligence, and forensics investigation pipeline by utilizing <span>AWS</span> based cloud infrastructure. We will cover scenarios, exercises and demos about building fully automated and scalable services that can perform both static as well as dynamic malware analysis, forensic artifact collection at scale, performing automated investigations against <span>IAM</span> attacks, gathering threat intelligence as well as creating alerts and reports.</p>
<p>By the end of this training, we will be able to use cloud technologies like Cloudtrail and Cloudwatch to detect <span>IAM</span> attacks, serverless functions to perform on-demand scans, docker containers to deploy our threat scanning services at scale, notification services to create detection alerts, malware-infected virtual machines to perform automated forensic investigations and artifacts collection, DynamoDB and <span>AWS</span> Athena for building real-time threat intelligence and monitoring dashboards. </p>
<p>We will learn to use in-built <span>AWS</span> services along with open source and custom-built tools to connect our file scanning services. In all, we will be building a&nbsp;fully automated incident response as well as threat intelligence pipeline that can be used by large scale security teams and researchers.</p>
<p>The workshop will begin by covering details about public cloud infrastructure like <span>AWS</span>, Azure, and <span>GCP</span>. We will build a&nbsp;technical and architectural understanding of the cloud and its services in the introductory phase. We will then dive into the Identity and access management based attack and defense scenarios along with running security assessments and automated tests against the entire infrastructure. </p>
<p>The second phase of the workshop will cover hands-on tool building for static file scanning of <span>AWS</span> object stores using clamAV and Yara engines. We will cover exercises on building and integrating serverless functions to build services like hash lookup, file-type determination and automated signature update through <span>S3</span> buckets. </p>
<p>The third phase of the workshop will deal with deploying <span>AWS</span> container services to run malware feature extraction and heuristic detection services at scale. By using real-life scenarios, we will build an alerting and notification service using <span>SNS</span> and slack. This service will integrate with lambda functions and web sockets to notify users when an infection is found. The next exercise of this phase will focus on building automated response and investigation using tags and cloudwatch events. </p>
<p>In the fourth phase of the workshop, we will learn to build real-time threat intelligence dashboards using Amazon Athena and <span>ELK</span> stack. We will learn to write queries to derive rich intelligence out of the collected data. </p>
<p>The final phase of the workshop will focus on forensic investigations in <span>AWS</span>. It begins by creating automated forensic artifact collection, integrating it with automated analysis like building timeline and dumping process memory. We will run through hands-on exercises on building investigation playbooks using step functions to automate most of the investigation and reporting process.</p>
