They <a href="http://scottexpedition.com/blog/ben-and-tarka-make-history">completed</a> the 1800-mile journey in just over three months, but <a href="https://kottke.org/14/01/fear-and-loathing-near-the-south-pole">fell short of doing it unsupported</a>.</p><p>This year, Saunders is back in Antarctica by himself, attempting the first solo, unsupported, unassisted crossing of the continent in <a href="http://bensaunders.com/trans-antarctic-solo/">the Trans-Antarctic Solo expedition</a>. The really cool part: <a href="http://bensaunders.com/blog/">he’s blogging the whole trip</a>. He’s already <a href="http://bensaunders.com/day-one/">completed day one</a> of the 1,024-mile journey, consisting of a short little 45-minute jaunt to set up his tent before hitting it in earnest on day two. Good luck, Ben! I’ll be following along <a href="http://bensaunders.com/blog/">on the blog</a>, via <a href="https://twitter.com/polarben">Twitter</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/polarben">Instagram</a>, and <a href="http://bensaunders.com/tracking/">tracking your progress on this map</a>.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BdQd1-QFYhu/">A bittersweet update from Ben today</a> (12/28/2017). After 52 days and 650 miles, he’s reached the South Pole. But he’s also not embarking on the return leg of the journey, thereby ending his expedition. A further explanation will come — it’s likely his journey was taking much longer than he had food for — but what I wrote when his last expedition ended prematurely holds:</p><blockquote><p>Adventure is never about battling the environment or elements or whatever. It’s always a struggle with the self. And as this battle reached a fevered pitch, Ben and Tarka were not found wanting. Calling for resupply, and thereby giving up on one of the major goals of this expedition 10 years in the making, was probably the hardest thing Ben has ever had to do in his entire life. But he did it, for his family, his loved ones, and his teammate. Ben, Tarka, I’m proud of you. Thank you for letting us follow along on your journey, for showing us what is humanly possible, and for the reminder that pushing the boundaries is never about how far you can tow a sled but about what you do when confronted with the no-win scenario: beating yourself.</p></blockquote><p>Congratulations, Ben!</p><p class="entry-tags-title">More about...</p></div></div></div></div>
