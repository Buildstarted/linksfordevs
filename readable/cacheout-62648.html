	<h2>Leaking Data on Intel CPUs via Cache Evictions</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			We present CacheOut, a new speculative execution attack that is capable of leaking data from Intel CPUs across many security boundaries. We show that despite Intel's attempts to address previous generations of speculative execution attacks, CPUs are still vulnerable, allowing attackers to exploit these vulnerabilities to leak sensitive data.
		</p>

		<p>
			Moreover, unlike previous MDS issues, we show in our work how an attacker can exploit the CPU's caching mechanisms to select what data to leak, as opposed to waiting for the data to be available. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that CacheOut can violate nearly every hardware-based security domain, leaking data from the OS kernel, co-resident virtual machines, and even SGX enclaves.
		</p>

	<h2>How SGX Fails in Practice</h2>
	<div>
		<p>SGAxe is an evolution of CacheOut, specifically targeting SGX enclaves. We show that despite extensive efforts done by Intel in order to mitigate SGX side channels, an attacker can still breach the confidentiality of SGX enclaves even when all side channel countermeasures are enabled.</p>

		<p>We then proceed to show an extraction of SGX private attestation keys from within SGX’s quoting enclave, as compiled and signed by Intel. With these keys in hand, we are able to sign fake attestation quotes, just as if these have initiated from trusted and genuine SGX enclaves. This erodes trust in the SGX ecosystem, as using such quotes an attacker can masquerade itself as a genuine SGX enclave to a remote party, while offering little protection in reality.</p>

		<h5> Recovering RSA Keys</h5>

		<p>CacheOut can extract RSA keys from a user program performing RSA decryptions using its private key. In this example, sampling the victim’s data takes about 40 seconds and another 10 seconds is spent on recovering the key from the collected data.</p>

		<h5>Dumping SGX Enclaves</h5>

		<p>To show our ability of leaking data from Intel SGX, we embedded the Mona Lisa (image on the left) inside an enclave. Then we collected some traces using CacheOut. We reconstruct the picture from these traces in real-time as shown in the image on the right.</p>

		<h5>Signing Arbitrary Quotes for Remote Attestation</h5>

		<p>We have also used CacheOut and SGAxe to recover private attestation keys from a fully updated SGX machine which is considered by Intel to be in a trusted status. With these private attestation keys in hands, we can sign arbitrary SGX attestation quotes which are then considered legitimate by Intel’s attestation service (or at least until they revoke our key). In the video below, we sign our own quote and then verify it against Intel’s Attestation Service.</p>

		<h5>Signing Your Own Quotes</h5>

		<p>We understand that remote attestion can be very tricky to pass. However, since we already done all the hard work of getting genuine attestation keys, we decided to help you out by developing a Twitter bot that passes SGX attestation for you. Our bot provides Attestation as a Service (AaaS), which allows you to get your own quotes signed with the keys we extracted using SGAxe. This way you can pass attestation without even owning an SGX machine. If you want to make use of our service, you can send a tweet to our bot <i></i> <a href="https://twitter.com/SGAxe_AaaS">@SGAxe_AaaS</a>. If you’ll tweet it, we’ll sign it!</p>

					<div>
						<p>After discussing our paper more thoroughly with Intel, it turns out we are leaking from a new and undocumented data path that passes information between L1-D evictions and the LFB.</p>
<p>We also have new attacks, leaking AES and RSA keys, as well as neural network weights across processes and across virtual machines. We also show how to attack the operating system kernel and hypervisors, extracting stack canaries. Moreover, we have breached the confidentiality of SGX enclaves, reading data from within the enclave’s memory.</p>
<p>Finally, we present SGAxe, which is a followup to CacheOut that extracts SGX attestation keys from Intel’s quoting enclave. With these keys at hand, network attackers are able to impersonate as legitimate SGX enclaves thereby eroding trust in the entire SGX ecosystem.</p>

						<p>Probably yes, unless you happen to have a CPU released after Q4 2018.</p>
<p>For a select number of processors released after Q4 2018, Intel advertently managed to partially mitigate this issue while addressing a previous issue called <a href="https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-intel-transactional-synchronization-extensions-intel-tsx-asynchronous-abort">TSX Asynchronous Abort</a>.

					<p>Intel will be providing CPU microcode updates to OEM vendors, that will be distributed to end users via BIOS updates. We recommend these to be installed as soon as they are available. In addition, Intel has provided recommendations for mitigation strategies for operating system (and hypervisor) software. More information can be found at <a href="https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/software-guidance/l1d-eviction-sampling">Intel's Software Guidance on L1D Eviction Sampling</a> and <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00329.html">Intel's Security Advisory (SA-00329)</a>.

				<div id="answer-5" aria-labelledby="question-5">
					<p>To mitigate SGAxe, Intel will first have to provide CPU microcode updates to patch the root cause behind CacheOut and L1DES to OEM vendors. These will then be provided to end users through BIOS updates. Intel will also perform a Trusted Compute Base (TCB) recovery, invalidation all previous attestation keys. This process will ensure that your system is in a secure state such that your system is able to use remote attestation again.</p>

						<p>AMD is not affected by CacheOut, as AMD does not offer any feature akin to Intel TSX or Intel SGX on their current offerings of CPUs.</p>
<p>Arm and IBM do have a feature similar to Intel TSX, but we are currently unaware of whether any of their products are affected. We are also unaware of any other attack vectors to exploit CacheOut.</p>

						<p>An operating system (OS) is system software responsible for managing your computer hardware by abstracting it through a common interface, which can be used by the software running on top of it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the operating system decides how this hardware is shared by your software, and as such has access to all the data stored in your computer's memory. Thus, it is essential to isolate the operating system from other programs running on the same machine.</p>

						<p>CacheOut violates the operating system's privacy by extracting information from it that facilitates other attacks, such as buffer overflow attacks.</p>
<p>More specifically, modern operating systems employ Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) and stack canaries. KASLR randomizes the location of the data structures and code used by the operating system, such that the location is unknown to an attacker. Stack canaries put secret values on the stack to detect whether an attacker has tampered with the stack. CacheOut extracts this information from the operating system, essentially enabling full exploitation via other software attacks, such such as buffer overflow attacks.</p>

						<p>Virtualization is a feature supported by modern CPUs that enables software emulation of the computer's physical hardware. This essentially allows you to instantiate multiple computers (called virtual machines), each running their own operating system and software, all while sharing the same underlying physical hardware.</p>
<p>Cloud providers use virtualization to partition and isolate physical hardware, such that customers can rent the hardware instead of having to purchase, set up, and maintain their own infrastructure. As many cloud instances share the same physical hardware, it is essential that cloud vendors maintain isolation between these instances.</p>

					<p>Intel SGX allows third-parties to run code on your machine with the guarantee that the code cannot be compromised. However, without the ability for the enclave to prove its genuinity to remote parties over the netwrok, Intel SGX would be useless.

					<p><a href="https://mdsattacks.com/">Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS)</a> shows that an attacker can sample in-flight data from various microarchitectural buffers. As a response to this, Intel recommends that operating system vendors overwrite the contents of these buffers. However, CacheOut demonstrates that this mitigation is incomplete, as we can force the victim's data out of the L1-D Cache into the microarchitectural buffers after the operating system clears them. We then subsequently leak the contents of the buffers and obtain the victim's data.</p>

						<p>As Crosstalk and SGAxe share a joint release, you may also have heard of or be hearing about Crosstalk. Similar to CacheOut and SGAxe, Crosstalk is a transient execution attack that is able to leak data from a micro-architectural buffer. While CacheOut and SGAxe focus on the Line Fill Buffer, Crosstalk instead focuses on the staging buffer, which is a buffer that is shared between different CPU cores. Therefore, Crosstalk is the very first cross-core transient execution attack.</p>
<p>It turns out that this staging buffer is shared between specific x86 instructions like cpuid and rdrand. As rdrand is the only source for random numbers trusted by Intel SGX, having the ability to leak the random numbers generated by rdrand is quite problematic. Especially since random numbers are essential for certain cryptographic algorithms. Like SGAxe, Crosstalk therefore focuses on Intel SGX.</p>

When Foreshadow was announced on January, 2018, Foreshadow allowed an attacker to extract the SGX sealing keys, just like SGAxe.</p>
<p>However, a lot of things have changed in those two years: machines have been patched and hardened against attacks like Meltdown, Foreshadow and MDS. Attestation keys extracted by Foreshadow have long since been revoked by Intel.
With SGAxe we show that, despite all of these efforts, it is still possible for an attacker to extract the SGX attestaion keys and sign counterfeit quotes outside of Intel SGX.</p>
