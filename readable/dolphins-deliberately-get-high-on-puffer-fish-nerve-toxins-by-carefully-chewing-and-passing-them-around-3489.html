    <p>Dolphins are thought of as one of the most intelligent species in the animal kingdom – and experts believe they have put their ingenuity to use in the pursuit of getting “high”.</p>
    

            
              
                
                
                  











  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>In extraordinary scenes filmed for a new documentary, young dolphins were seen carefully manipulating a certain kind of puffer fish which, if provoked, releases a nerve toxin.</p>
    

            
              
                
                
                  



  












  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>Though large doses of the toxin can be deadly, in small amounts it is known to produce a narcotic effect, and the dolphins appeared to have worked out how to make the fish release just the right amount.</p>

    <p>Carefully chewing on the puffer and passing it between one another, the marine mammals then enter what seems to be a trance-like state.</p>
    

            
              
                
                
                  





  









  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>The behaviour was captured on camera by the makers of Dolphins: Spy in the Pod, a series produced for BBC One by the award-winning wildlife documentary producer John Downer.</p>
    

            
              
                
                
                  











  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>Rob Pilley, a zoologist who also worked as a producer on the series, told the <em>Sunday Times</em>: “This was a case of young dolphins purposely experimenting with something we know to be intoxicating.</p>
    

            
              
                
                
                  











  
    
  

  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>“After chewing the puffer gently and passing it round, they began acting most peculiarly, hanging around with their noses at the surface as if fascinated by their own reflection.</p>
    

            
              
                
                
                  











  
  
  
  






                
              
            

            
            
          
            
    <p>“It reminded us of that craze a few years ago when people started licking toads to get a buzz, especially the way they hung there in a daze afterwards. It was the most extraordinary thing to see.”</p>

    <p>The documentary makers used spy cameras hidden in fake turtles, fish and squid to film 900 hours of footage showing dolphins in their natural habitats.</p>

    <p>It is the latest in a long run of wildlife documentaries made by Downer which use similar spy camera techniques. Previous series include Penguins: Spy in the Huddle, which like the Dolphins programme was narrated by David Tennant, Elephants: Spy in the Herd with David Attenborough and Lions: Spy in the Den.</p>
