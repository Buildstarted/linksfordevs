<p data-adtags-visited="true">I’ve stuck to that schedule ever since. I’m finding that running does 3 things for me.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">First, it clears my head. Second, it makes me think faster. And thirdly, after running I just feel happier – like hard things are somehow easier.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Today I want to discuss the merits of running as they have been outlined by Christopher McDougall in his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307279189/ref=mobilebookrev-20">“Born to Run.”</a></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>At the end of this post I’ll share the most surprising thing I learned about running from reading this book.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“‘Try the meditation of the trail, just walk along looking at the trail at your feet and don’t look about and just fall into a trance as the group zips by,’ Kerouac wrote. Trails are like that: you’re floating along in a Shakespearean garden paradise and expect to see nymphs and flute boys, then suddenly you’re struggling in a hot broiling sun of hell in dust and nettles and poison oak… just like life.” – Christopher McDougall</p></blockquote>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Life is tough. There’s no doubt about it. Running shows me that I have&nbsp; more power and potential than I thought.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Beyond the very extremes of fatigue and distress, we may find amounts of ease and power we never dreamed ourselves to own: sources of strength never taxed at all because we never push through the obstruction.” – William James</p></blockquote>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">But then how do you turn the fatigue into energy?</p>
<blockquote><p>“Strictly by accident Scott stumbled upon the most advanced weapon in the ultrarunners arsenal: Instead of cringing from fatigue, you embrace it. You refuse to let it go. You get to know it so well, you’re not afraid of it anymore.” – Christopher McDougall</p></blockquote>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Running gives me the tools I need to deconstruct life’s problems and find solutions.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“The only way to truly conquer something, as every great philosopher and geneticist will tell you, is to love it.” – Christopher McDougall</p></blockquote>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Running makes me feel as strong as Superman.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“If there’s any magic bullet to make human beings healthy it’s to run.” – Christopher McDougall</p></blockquote>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Benjamin Franklin worked on problems while he slept. He discovered that if he went to sleep thinking about a problem, more often than not, he’d wake up with a solution. Sometimes running is like this. And sometimes it’s not.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you don’t have answers to your problems after a 4 hour run, you aint getting them.” – Christopher McDougall</p></blockquote>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Sometimes people think running is all about competition and proving that you are stronger, better, and faster. <strong>Competition gets in the way of running. I run to get outside myself.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“The reason we race isn’t so much to beat each other, he understood. But to be with each other. Scott learned that before he had a choice, back when he was trailing. He was no good and had no reason to believe he ever would be, but the joy he got from running was the joy of adding his power to the pack. Other runners try to disassociate from the fatigue by blasting iPods or imagining the roar of the crowd in an Olympic stadium, but Scott had a simpler method. It’s easy to get outside yourself when you’re thinking about someone else.” – Christopher McDougall</p></blockquote>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Running doesn’t require special equipment. You don’t to rally a team. You can just go outside and run at any time.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“I keep thinking back to the way Garp used to burst out his door in the middle of the workday and go for a five mile run. There’s something so universal about that sensation, the way running unites our two most primal impulses: fear and pleasure. We run when we’re scared, we run when we’re ecstatic, we run away from our problems and run around for a good time.” – Christopher McDougall</p></blockquote>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">There you go. We’re nearly finished. I’ve discussed the reasons I run as they have been outlined in Christopher McDougall’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307279189/ref=mobilebookrev-20">“Born to Run.”</a></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">I run because it clears my head. I run because it makes me think faster. I run because I just feel happier. And now as promised, here’s the most surprising detail in the book.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Running has always surged when there is a national crisis.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“And when things look worst, we run the most. Three times, America has seen distance running skyrocket, and it’s always in the midst of a national crisis.” – Christopher McDougall</p></blockquote>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Thanks for reading. Keep running!</p>
<blockquote><p>“You don’t stop running because you get old. You get old because you stop running.” – Christopher McDougall</p></blockquote>
