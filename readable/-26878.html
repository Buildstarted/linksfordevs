<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>A data breach suffered by Rocket Dollar Inc. in April has raised questions about best practices in the event of cybersecurity incidents.</p> <p>The Austin-based startup — which aims to put retirement money into unorthodox investment vehicles such as startups and cryptocurrencies — on June 3 sent letters to customers throughout the country to inform them of the breach and what action they could take.</p> <!----> <p>In a <a href="https://ago.vermont.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2019-03-06-Rocket-Dollar-Inc-SBN-to-Consumers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a> to Vermont residents, Rocket Dollar founder and CEO <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/search/results?q=Henry%20Yoshida">Henry Yoshida</a> informed customers that an “unknown individual gained access” to one of the company’s databases. In response, Rocket Dollar hired a computer forensic company to conduct an investigation, the letter said. Results of that investigation indicated that potential disclosures included customer names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, drivers license numbers and financial account information.</p> <p>The letter stipulated that Rocket Dollar is “unaware of any misuse of” that information and offered free identity-theft protection services through ID Experts Corp.</p> <p>Rocket Dollar emerged from stealth mode in 2018. It provides individuals more investment options with their retirement funds while keeping the same tax benefits afforded by individual retirement accounts and employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement savings plans. Investment possibilities include funding startups and small businesses, real estate, cryptocurrencies and even direct loans, said Yoshida, previously co-founder of <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/profile/company/org_ch_597dbe0d152210807b9341c5d0f1d90a" data-ct="APT:bbm_profile_link">Honest Dollar</a> Inc. Goldman Sachs acquired Honest Dollar a year after its launch.</p> <p>Rocket Dollar customers such as Austin resident <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/search/results?q=Taylor%20McCaslin">Taylor McCaslin</a> were not happy with the company’s handling of the situation. McCaslin on June 7 <a href="https://twitter.com/digital_SaaS/status/1137014795717054470" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> his displeasure. A product manager at New Knowledge, which helps protect organizations against disinformation online, McCaslin tweeted that the letter he received in the mail “was generic, unclear, full of legalese, &amp; over a month after exposure of financial &amp; P-II data [including Social Security numbers]. And requires me to do all the work. Also no public disclosure.”</p> <p>In another tweet on June 7, McCaslin admonished the company to “be more transparent. Acknowledge mistakes. Publically [sic] tell us how you’re going to do better.”</p> <p>Some cybersecurity experts agree with McCaslin’s take. <a href="https://digitalguardian.com/blog/data-breach-experts-share-most-important-next-step-you-should-take-after-data-breach-2014-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a blog post on the Data Guardian website</a>, Oleksandr Maidaniuk, who heads quality assurance at Ciklum ApS in Ukraine, said communication is the “key step” to manage data breaches. He instructs executives to be open and sincere and admit fault and accept responsibility. Maidaniuk also instructed affected companies to “provide details” and “explain why the situation took place.”</p> <p>In a November 2017 TechRepublic <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/8-steps-to-take-within-48-hours-of-a-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story</a>, Scott Matteson advised companies that have endured data breaches to “make public announcements and prepare for responses.” Matteson also wrote that organizations should describe what has been “done to remedy the breach, what it intends to do in the future, and what (if any) steps customers should take to protect themselves, such as by changing passwords, contacting credit card companies or placing fraud alerts.”</p> <p>McCaslin directed Rocket Dollar to Maidaniuk’s and others’ advice and the TechRepublic article in his tweets.</p> <p>Rocket Dollar has customers in 49 states, with South Dakota being the sole exception.</p> <p>States vary when it comes to disclosure laws and policies, which is why customers in Massachusetts received a different <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/06/07/15182_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter.</a></p> <p>Texas <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.521.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law </a>requires security-breach disclosure to those affected “as quickly as possible” after learning of the breach. That notification applies also to any situation in which it is reasonably believed that sensitive personal information was obtained by an unauthorized person. The disclosure can be delayed if it could “impede a criminal investigation,” according to Texas state law. If the breach affects more than 10,000 people, all relevant consumer reporting agencies must also be notified.</p> <p>In response to questions from Austin Business Journal, Yoshida provided a written statement through email:</p> <blockquote>"We regrettably experienced a data breach in late April in which our customers’ data may have been compromised. Our team caught it immediately, and we notified regulators and law enforcement. We are actively assisting the FBI in their ongoing investigation into the matter. We take the security of information entrusted to us seriously and are sorry this incident occurred. We took immediate steps to notify affected persons regarding what happened, and are providing identity monitoring services to everyone affected."</blockquote> <p>Following questions from ABJ, Rocket Dollar on June 18 also <a href="https://info.rocketdollar.com/learn/april/2019/disclosure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a statement on its website as well as an example of a letter it sent to customers regarding the breach.</p> <p>“In accordance with individual state laws regarding proper notification to affected people following a data breach, we mailed individual letters making those affected aware of the incident and provided steps to ensure that data was not misused,” reads part of the statement.</p> <p>It continues that Rocket Dollar “immediately changed all system passwords and restored all servers. We implemented tighter firewall restrictions and all systems were patched to the latest patch level. We also notified and met with the FBI and launched an internal investigation with a third-party forensic specialist to learn how exactly the incident occurred. We also alerted the state attorneys general. In the weeks since the breach, we have undergone a SOC2 Type II audit, which covers data security, availability, integrity, confidentiality, and privacy processes, and a penetration test, to ensure that our security standards are to the absolute highest levels.”</p></div></div></div>
