I accept your viewpoint on this subpoint, so let's modify the proposal accordingly:</p><del>The subclass can access protected members in the sealed base class. Alternatively, if this causes a problem for some reason, it would also be acceptable to deny access to protected members.</del><br>The subclass cannot access <code>protected</code> members in the sealed base class.<p>By the way, re "acceptable" in the above quote, that's probably a contributing factor to the strange negative knee-jerk reactions from some forum participants (not you):  Those people might have misunderstood my use of the word "acceptable".  They might not have understood that I meant "acceptable" as jargon/terminology.  Likewise many standards use jargon such as "shall" and "shall not" and it sounds terribly impolite but it's not impolite because "shall" is special jargon in those standards.</p><p>I can understand and sympathize when negative emotions are triggered by impolite wording, but in this case "Proposal:", "acceptable", "shall not", etc aren't impolite words, and also aren't demands or orders.  Just speaking in general (not about anyone in particular), some people in society have suffered unfair and awful mistreatment in school in the past, and this can trigger hypersensitive reactions later in life (including inability to accept suggestions for corrections to mistakes), but my use of jargon was intended to be <strong>respectful, polite, and direct</strong>, from one professional to another professional.  It was certainly never intended to mean <em>"I want this feature and you must make it, and only XYZ is acceptable."</em></p><p>I do NOT want this feature.  I want to discuss it.  I'm also happy to modify the proposal in response to feedback.</p><blockquote><p>Also, have you seen Extension Everywhere? This would allow the safe aspects of your idea.</p></blockquote><p>Thanks for your helpful link to <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="153598385" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/11159" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/roslyn/issues/11159/hovercard" href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/11159">dotnet/roslyn#11159</a> and thanks also to <a class="user-mention" data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/HaraGabi/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/HaraGabi">@HaraGabi</a> for linking to <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="209323681" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/164" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/csharplang/issues/164/hovercard" href="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/164">dotnet/csharplang#164</a></p><blockquote><p>Can you provide a killer example</p></blockquote><ol><li>In <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="450424242" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/780" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/780/hovercard" href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/780">microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml#780</a> unsealing is described as a <strong>"longstanding request from our community"</strong>, thus the community does view it as a significant problem when they're prevented from making derived classes.</li><li><a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="209323681" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/164" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/csharplang/issues/164/hovercard" href="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/164">dotnet/csharplang#164</a> and <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="153598385" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/11159" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/roslyn/issues/11159/hovercard" href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/11159">dotnet/roslyn#11159</a> are virtually equivalent to saying that the original definition of <code>sealed class</code> is good but contains one mistake.  That one mistake is that <code>sealed class</code> is excessively restrictive.</li><li>Some other example.  It's not my responsibility to identify all examples.</li></ol><blockquote><p>These kinds of updates aren't out of question,</p></blockquote><p>These kinds of updates have already been performed multiple times in the past in order to fix mistakes, or to implement improvements or new features.  But I'm not going to try to pressure you or anyone else into implementing this feature.  As always:  If you like the idea, then you're welcome to use it or a modified version of it or whatever you want.  If you don't like the idea, then you're also welcome to discard it.  <strong>Whatever you want; it's your choice.</strong>  That's how it works.  This applies to all proposals from all participants.  If you like it, use it.  If you don't like it, don't use it.</p><blockquote><p>we'd want a strong justification for doing so.</p></blockquote><p>That's understandable, but other forum participants seem to misunderstand this point.  Thus for their benefit not yours, I'll say this:  The justification is primarily your responsibility/job, not mine.  I understand that if I want something, then <em>obviously</em> the chances are better if I help staff members to do their jobs, such as by researching and providing justifications for proposals.  Thus it's helpful if I provide justifications, and I'd like to do this where possible (if time permits), but it's not my job and not my responsibility to do so.</p><p>The way you've said "strong justification" is reasonable, but the problem is that some non-staff forum participants frequently copy your wording and misuse or abuse it in many messages in the CoreCLR repo.  Your extreme fans want to be you so strongly that they start pretending that they <em>are</em> you.  (Indirectly pretending, not outright, and not deliberately.)  They start copying your wording, tone of authority, etc.  A typical extreme fan tends to unconsciously mislead other forum participants into believing that he (the fan) has a very high status or that he is an official spokesperson of the .NET Foundation or Microsoft, when in reality he is merely just another random participant of the forum with equal status as the other participants.</p><p>Extreme fans tend to drive away "normal" (non-extreme) participants of forums/repos.  The demographic of the repo changes to mainly a group of co-dependent extreme fans, and many or most of the "normal" participants are driven away.  "Normal" participants typically don't have the very large amount of patience necessary to deal with extreme fans.</p><p>Extreme fans aren't bad people.  They're actually good people who do bad things without knowing it.</p></div></div></div></div>
