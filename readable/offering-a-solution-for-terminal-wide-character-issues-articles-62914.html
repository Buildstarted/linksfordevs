<h2>Quicktro</h2>
<p>The printable length of most characters are equal to the number of cells they
occupy on the screen: <tt>1 character : 1 cell</tt>. However, there are categories of
characters that occupy <strong>2 cells</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms">full-width</a>), and others that occupy <strong>0
cells</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner">zero-width</a>).</p>
<p>All popular terminals support displaying full and zero-width Unicode characters
correctly. For CLI applications and their libraries, such as <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/PROJECTS.rst#projects-using-prompt_toolkit">python-prompt-toolkit</a>, it is just a matter of calling into the python <a href="https://github.com/jquast/wcwidth">wcwidth</a>
library when rendering characters for display, albeit with a <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/ff0548487a644e722943f9685666c3963311c17f/prompt_toolkit/utils.py#L136-L144">small bit of
care</a> around the occasional <cite>-1</cite> return value.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-problem">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>If this is a solved problem, why do we still see so many <em>misaligned</em> characters
in Terminal applications?</p>
<p><img alt="An example of misaligned wide characters by the Hyper Terminal" src="https://jeffquast.com/images/hyper-example.png"></p><p>At this time of writing, each Unicode version, <tt>4.1</tt>, <tt>5.1</tt>, <tt>5.2</tt>,
<tt>8.0</tt>, <tt>9.0</tt>, <tt>10.0</tt>, <tt>11.0</tt>, <tt>12.0</tt>, <tt>12.1</tt>, and <tt>13.0</tt>, have
support for more full and zero-width characters than their previous version,
with many more versions expected to be released in the coming years.</p>
<p>Chinese, Japanese, and Korean users, whose languages use full-width characters
have been the most impacted by this problem. The Western world only seemed to
notice it with the introduction of emoticons in <a href="http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/">Unicode version 9.0</a>.</p>
<p>Terminal and library authors <strong>select only one</strong> version of Unicode when they
implement <a href="https://jeffquast.com/post/terminal_wcwidth_solution/zero-width">zero</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms">full-width</a> support. Sometimes, the latest
specification is used, but usually not. Most just copy any existing solution
without too much care, and we can't really blame them, it's actually a pretty
difficult decision.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>, for example, makes great care for Unicode support, but supports only
version <a href="http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/">8.0</a> unless the check box, <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-preferences-profiles-text.html">"Use unicode version 9+ widths"</a> is
enabled (<tt>12.1.0</tt> at time of this writing). The choice to use <a href="http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/">8.0</a> by default
is likely made to match the libc version linked by most C/C++ Terminal apps
that include <tt>wchar.h</tt> from the standard C library. On <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9352753/which-unicode-versions-are-supported-in-which-os-x-and-ios-versions/38442010#38442010">Mac OS X 10.11.5 and
newer</a>, this is also version 8.</p>
<p>Many 3rd party applications and languages conform to only Unicode <tt>5.0</tt> (such
as <a href="https://github.com/vercel/hyper">hyper</a> terminal in the above figure), which happens to be the version of
Unicode in the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/wcwidth.c">wcwidth.c</a> file released by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Kuhn_(computer_scientist)">Markus Khun</a> into the public
domain in 2007 from which almost all implementations are duplicated from.</p>
<div id="problem-statement">
<h3>Problem statement</h3>
<p>The version of Unicode used by Terminals and Libraries will continue to be a
problem, because new versions of the Unicode Standard are issued periodically,
but the source code of libraries and applications are not updated at the same
time, or at all!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/wcwidth.c">wcwidth.c</a> family of libraries in use cannot know what version of Unicode
your terminal supports, and the terminal cannot know what version an application
intends to use.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-solution">
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>In the python <a href="https://github.com/jquast/wcwidth">wcwidth</a> library, I added support for <strong>all versions of Unicode</strong>,
it requires only a matter of selecting the right version, by function argument,
or, by environment variable, <tt>UNICODE_VERSION</tt>.</p>
<p>But how can we know what version is used?  Well, I do hope other language
implementations of <tt>wcwidth()</tt> and <tt>wcswidth()</tt> can follow my example of
multi-version and selection support by the environment <tt>UNICODE_VERSION</tt>, and,
that terminal emulators can export their supported version by environment value.</p>
<p>But this is going to take some time, perhaps only by my own volunteer efforts,
which is probably a lot more in discussion and education than code. So, this
article is my first attempt at starting those discussions.</p>
<p>I've authored another tool, <a href="https://github.com/jquast/ucs-detect/">ucs-detect</a>, which is able to <strong>automatically detect
the version of unicode</strong> that the connecting Terminal supports. For any
application using the python <a href="https://github.com/jquast/wcwidth">wcwidth</a> library, the correct return value is
selected by using the given value of the <tt>UNICODE_VERSION</tt> environment variable.</p>
<p>With this solution, we can correctly determine the <tt>UNICODE_VERSION</tt> of <a href="https://github.com/vercel/hyper">hyper</a>
terminal as <tt>5.1.0</tt>, and those cells that were previously thought to be
full-width, are now correctly determined to be half-width by the <a href="https://github.com/jquast/wcwidth">wcwidth</a> python
library, and align correctly:</p>
<p><img alt="An example of corrected alignment by Hyper Terminal" src="https://jeffquast.com/images/hyper-example-fixed.png"></p><p>For developers who work on this stuff, please take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/jquast/ucs-detect/">ucs-detect</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/jquast/wcwidth">wcwidth</a> documentation for a more complete description of how this all works.  I
would like to see this solution adapted to more shells and CLI apps until
Terminal emulators and libraries can be persuaded.</p>
<p>The standard C library in particular is very unlikely to adopt, and only after
many several years if it does. Luckily for us, modern Terminal applications are
rapidly developed in dynamic languages where such changes can be much more
quickly propagated.</p>
<div id="interim">
<h3>Interim</h3>
<p>Download and install <a href="https://github.com/jquast/ucs-detect/">ucs-detect</a>, and add to your shell profile:</p>
<pre>if [ -z "$UNICODE_VERSION" ] &amp;&amp; command -v ucs-detect &gt;/dev/null; then
    eval "$(ucs-detect)"
fi
</pre>

<h2>While I have your attention</h2>
<p>If you're reading this, you must have some level of interest in Terminals, so if
you are not aware of the <strong>continued, unrelenting, voluntary</strong> contributions to
the Terminal ecosystem by <a href="https://invisible-island.net/">Thomas E. Dickey</a>, please take a moment to have
a look at his website.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to me, at least, is the documented <a href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-license.html">trials and
tribulations</a> of developing <a href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.html">ncurses</a>. I like to think that a lot of the
software engineering work we come into contact with each day would have
happened eventually, no matter who did it. But <a href="https://invisible-island.net/">Thomas E. Dickey</a> is
one of those exemplary folks who have the discipline to solve the smallest and
most difficult problems that can add up to the greatest change.  Every engineer
should have at least 1 role model, and Mr. Dickey is one of mine.</p>
<p>And also, I'm no longer with a <a href="https://jeffquast.com/post/without_a_job_or_home/">$JOB or $HOME</a>. <strong>If you are employing, I am
looking</strong>, and willing to relocate (except for maybe SF and NYC).  Please take a
look at my <a href="https://jeffquast.com/resume-jquast.pdf">resume</a>!  I have about 19 years of Python and about 23 years of Linux
experience, I'm pretty OK at those, and a few other things, too.</p>
