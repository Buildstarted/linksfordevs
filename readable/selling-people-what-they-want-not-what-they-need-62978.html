<p>Last year (in fall of 2019) I took almost 4 months off work to do an experiment. I decided to start a business solving a problem I thought that a lot of people had and wasnâ€™t being addressed.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://www.iteachrecruiters.com/">a video course to teach recruiters how to talk to software engineers</a>.</p>

<p>I knew for a fact (as an engineer who gets contacted by recruiters nearly every day) that this was a real problem and the majority recruiters have very little understanding of what the industry they are recruiting for and the people they are contacting.</p>

<p>But, it was a hard sell. Many recruiters didnâ€™t <em>want</em> to learn this stuff. They didnâ€™t see this as valuable and how it translated into more money for them.</p>

<h2 id="i-didnt-understand-the-recruiting-industry-at-first">I didnâ€™t understand the recruiting industry at first.</h2>

<p>I should first explain, the recruiting industry is special in many ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The turnover rate is high. Many recruiters wash out of the industry in less than a year.</li>
  <li>The customer is the hiring manager, not the candidate.</li>
  <li>Much of the industry is made of large firms that are based on hitting numbers and metrics.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="they-didnt-want-it">They didnâ€™t <em>want</em> it.</h2>

<p>The fact was, I was trying to sell people something they <strong>need</strong> but not what they <strong>want</strong>. Recruiters wanted more leads. They wanted more replies to their emails.</p>

<p>But, what they actually <strong>needed</strong> was to understand the industry so they didnâ€™t waste their time contacting the wrong people. Unfortunately, I had to educate my prospective customers about this before I could make a sale.</p>

<p>I tried to create a <a href="http://localhost:8000/blog/january-2020-developer-survey-on-recruiting/">body of evidence and data using surveys</a> to prove this. I had to do this because I had to convince people.</p>

<p>If you sell a customer a thing they already <strong>want</strong>, there is no hurdle of convincing them and changing their mind. They know they want it, now it just comes down to product and price. But I tried to do something that requires an argument first.</p>

<p>I couldnâ€™t even figure out how to do advertisements for my course because the google search traffic for the keywords was so low. Recruiters were not searching for the thing I was making!</p>

<h2 id="the-big-recruiting-firms">The big recruiting firms</h2>

<p>Just didnâ€™t care. They have training courses and what I was doing was redundant to them. Anyway they didnâ€™t seem to care a whole lot about building relationships. From my perspective (having interacted with these folks a lot as a candidate) they just seemed to care about placing a whole of people really quickly and if that meant emailing and calling a hundred people a day, well that is how it would be done.</p>

<p>To be fair, Iâ€™ve spoken to some really nice folks working at the big firms. But I certainly never made any sales, even if I pointed out that they contacted me about a C# job when I clearly had a Java background ðŸ¤£.</p>

<h2 id="i-was-trying-to-sell-to-recruiters-but-i-needed-to-sell-to-managers">I was trying to sell to recruiters, but I needed to sell to managers.</h2>

<p>Because I didnâ€™t realize the focus on hitting numbers and high wash out rate I started off trying to sell courses directly to individual recruiters.</p>

<p>I realized if I tried to sell to individual recruiters I would have to price the course cheaply and do a huge amount of volume. And I would have to convince every single person that they wanted this thing. I just couldnâ€™t see a way to make it work.</p>

<p>After I understood this I decided to make the price higher and sell to more experienced managers at small recruiting firms. The managers knew that this information would make a difference and help recruiters form better relationships with candidates. <strong>The pain point for them was providing this training ad-hoc to every new hire.</strong></p>

<p>These recruiting managers and owners of search firms already understood the need and wanted this because it would save them time in training their new recruiters.</p>

<p>This is how I found the <strong>want</strong> in the market. I finally started to gain traction.</p>

<p><strong>Then the pandemic hit and hiring and spending slowed! But thatâ€™s a story for another timeâ€¦</strong></p>
