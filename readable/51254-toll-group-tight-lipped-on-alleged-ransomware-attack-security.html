Travelex has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/01/09/travelex-refuses-say-paid-6m-ransom-hackers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">refused to say publicly</a> if it paid the $9 million ransom or not.</p><p>Total losses from malware can be much more substantial, however. A Petya malware infection <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/tnt-express-pegs-petya-losses-at-374m-473837" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cost fellow logistics firm TNT Express $374 million</a>, while staff at law firm DLA Piper put in <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/dla-piper-paid-15000-hours-of-it-overtime-after-notpetya-attack-490495" rel="noopener" target="_blank">15,000 hours of overtime</a> to recover from an encounter with the same piece of malware.</p></div></div></div></div>
