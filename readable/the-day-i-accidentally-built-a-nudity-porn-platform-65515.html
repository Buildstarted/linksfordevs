<p>I didn‚Äôt know that my next project will turn into a nudity platform and a home for spammers. But it did happen while I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. And here are the details.</p>



<p>For the next 5/10 years, I‚Äôve decided that my mission will be: ‚Äú<strong>Can a Moroccan build an online business and make a living from Morocco?</strong>‚Äú. I currently launch multiple projects and give them some time to take off. My blog <a href="https://remote.ma/">remote.ma</a>, my jobs board <a href="https://okjob.io/">okjob.io</a>, and other projects are all examples of this. The project I‚Äôm talking about today, was also serving the same purpose in theory, but it was a flop.</p>



<p>That project is <a href="https://mylink.fyi/">mylink.fyi</a>, a personal and unique link for all your other links. I built it during my weekends given I already have a full-time job and it took me two months approximately. It‚Äôs like <a href="https://linktr.ee/">linktree</a> and other competitors, but I tried to make it different. No ads, no logo, a clean interface, a 100% score in performance‚Ä¶ My idea was: take a competitor product, remove all features you don‚Äôt need, and make it crazy fast. You have a 14 days free trial to test it out, but you need to upgrade your account afterwards.</p>



<p>I launched it in February 2020 with a completely different identity. I took my name, and thus my followers and my authority, out of the equation. <strong>I wanted to replicate ‚Äúsomeone starting from scratch‚Äù as close as possible</strong>. I did use the service for my links (and <a href="https://remote.ma/">remote.ma</a>‚Äòs links) but I never advertised the service on my personal account. You can see the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mylink-fyi">Product Hunt</a> launch, and the imaginary <a href="https://twitter.com/HamidNekcha">Twitter account</a> I created.</p>



<p>Given how I built the app, I optimized it in a way I‚Äôll only pay hosting fees when the site is having a lot of traffic. Like 1M+ visits per month. So I forgot about it, and kept an eye on the bills I get. Two weeks after launch, I had 100 users. No premium account.</p>



<p>Three months went by with 0$ bills. But in June, I received <strong>my non-zero bill</strong>, it‚Äôs exciting the app is taking off! I logged to Firebase (the infrastructure I‚Äôm using) and found a total of 1000 users! Wow, that‚Äôs a lot.</p>



<p>I took a look at the emails, and quickly saw that something was off. I‚Äôve seen multiple accounts with the same email structure, something like emily123@gmail.com, emily456@gmail.com‚Ä¶ I knew something isn‚Äôt right given there is a lot of them. So I decided to take a closer look and see the links they are sharing.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs when I discovered <strong>they were sharing porn and nudes links</strong>. These links aren‚Äôt permitted on social media, so they used mylink.fyi to ‚Äúshadow‚Äù them. For these platforms, they are mylink.fyi links. But once you visit it, you‚Äôll see a link for the banned site. <strong>There were hundreds of accounts doing this</strong>. And new ones get created every day. Once the trial period is over, they create a new email, a new account, and then repeat the same process. Oups!</p>



<p>I decided to remove all my links from the platform given it‚Äôs probably known for ‚Äúporn and nudes‚Äù now. I logged to Instagram, and got a weird message: ‚Äú<strong>Your profile link is not working</strong>‚Äú. I didn‚Äôt knew what that means, but once I visited my profile, I‚Äôve seen I can‚Äôt click on the mylink.fyi link. Wow, what‚Äôs that? I visited my other profile, and got the same message and the same problem! I later discovered that Instagram banned all mylink.fyi links from the platform. A customer also confirmed to me via email that Snapchat started blocking links. Heh, I‚Äôm banned by Instagram and Snapchat! From all scenarios I had in mind, <strong>this is not something I prepared for</strong>.</p>



<p>The first thing I tried is reducing the trial period from 14 days to 5 days. I was hoping I‚Äôll make them stop. But nothing changed, I can‚Äôt outplay them. Damn it! Other solutions include: requiring credit cards for trial periods, ban all adult content from the platform‚Ä¶ But they all require me to put extra effort in the project. And I don‚Äôt have time for that.</p>



<p>I disabled signups on mylink.fyi for now, and after all trials reach their end, I‚Äôll take the service off. If you‚Äôre interested in acquiring the domain name, and/or the app, <a href="https://elazzabi.com/contact/">let‚Äôs talk</a>.</p>



<p><strong>That‚Äôs it for your daily dose of weird Internet anecdotes.</strong></p>

I‚Äôm Ahmed from Morocco and I build things using code, a.k.a a Software Engineer.

I hold an electrical engineering degree and I‚Äôm a self taught software developer. I figured out my love for building things when I started my first online business at the age of 17.

I blog at elazzabi.com and remote.ma.			<a href="https://elazzabi.com/author/elazzabiahmed/" rel="author">
