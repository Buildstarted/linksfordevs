    <p>Some web APIs increase the risk of side-channel attacks like Spectre. To
mitigate that risk, browsers offer an opt-in-based isolated environment called
cross-origin isolated. With a cross-origin isolated state, the webpage will be
able to use privileged features including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer"><code>SharedArrayBuffer</code></a>
(required for WebAssembly Threads)</li>
<li><a href="https://web.dev/monitor-total-page-memory-usage/"><code>performance.measureMemory()</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling/">JS Self-Profiling API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The cross-origin isolated state also prevents modifications of
<code>document.domain</code>. (Being able to alter <code>document.domain</code> allows communication
between same-site documents and has been considered a loophole in the
same-origin policy.)</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong>
These powerful features and the prevention of <code>document.domain</code> modification
are not yet enabled in Chrome as of version 83. We'll update this post as they
become available.</p>
<p>To opt in to a cross-origin isolated state, you need to send the following
HTTP headers on the main document:</p>
<web-copy-code><pre><code> require-corp<br> same-origin</code></pre>
</web-copy-code><p>These headers instruct the browser to block loading of resources or iframes
which haven't opted into being loaded by cross-origin documents, and prevent
cross-origin windows from directly interacting with your document. This also
means those resources being loaded cross-origin require opt-ins.</p>
<p>You can determine whether a web page is in a cross-origin isolated state by
examining
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/crossOriginIsolated"><code>self.crossOriginIsolated</code></a>.
(This works on Firefox but has yet to be implemented in Chrome).</p>
<p>This article shows how to use these new headers. In <a href="https://web.dev/why-coop-coep">a follow-up
article</a> I will provide more background and context.</p>
<p>This article is aimed at those who would like to get their websites ready for
using <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code>, WebAssembly Threads, <code>performance.measureMemory()</code>
or the JS Self-Profiling API in a more robust manner across browser
platforms.</p>

<h2 id="deploy-coop-and-coep-to-make-your-website-cross-origin-isolated">Deploy COOP and COEP to make your website cross-origin isolated </h2>
<h3 id="integrate-coop-and-coep">Integrate COOP and COEP </h3>

<p>By enabling COOP on a top-level document, windows
with the same origin, and windows opened from the document, will have a separate
browsing context group unless they are in the same origin with the same COOP
setting. Thus, isolation is enforced for opened windows.</p>
<p>A browsing context group is a group of tabs, windows or iframes which share the
same context. For example, if a website (<code>https://a.example</code>) opens a popup
window (<code>https://b.example</code>), the opener window and the popup window share the
same browsing context and they have access to each other via DOM APIs such as
<code>window.opener</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://webdev.imgix.net/coop-coep/browsing-context-group.png" alt="Browsing Context Group"></p>
<p>As of Chrome 83, dedicated DevTools support is not yet available for COOP.
However, you can examine <code>window.opener === null</code> from the opened window, or
<code>openedWindow.closed === true</code> from the opener window to determine if they are
in separate browsing context groups.</p>

<h4 id="2.-ensure-resources-have-corp-or-cors-enabled">2. Ensure resources have CORP or CORS enabled </h4>
<p>Make sure that all resources in the page are loaded with CORP or CORS
HTTP headers. This step
is required for <a href="#enable-coep">step four, enabling COEP</a>.</p>
<p>Here is what you need to do depending on the nature of the resource:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the resource is expected to be loaded <strong>only from the same origin</strong>, set
the <code>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin</code> header.</li>
<li>If the resource is expected to be loaded <strong>only from the same site but cross
origin</strong>, set the <code>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-site</code> header.</li>
<li>If the resource is <strong>loaded from cross origin(s) under your control</strong>, set the
<code>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin</code> header if possible.</li>
<li>For cross origin resources that you have no control over:
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>crossorigin</code> attribute in the loading HTML tag if the resource is
served with CORS.</li>
<li>Ask the owner of the resource to support either CORS or CORP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For iframes, use CORP and COEP headers as follows:
<code>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin</code> and <code>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Term:</strong>
It's important that you understand the difference between "same-site" and
"same-origin". Learn about the difference at <a href="https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin">Understanding same-site and
same-origin</a>.</p>

<p>Before fully enabling COEP, you can do a dry run by using the
<code>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy-Report-Only</code> header to examine whether the policy
actually works. You will receive reports without blocking embedded content.
Recursively apply this to all documents. For information on the Report-Only HTTP
header, see <a href="#observe-issues-using-the-reporting-api">Observe issues using the Reporting
API</a>.</p>
<h4 id="enable-coep">4. Enable COEP </h4>
<p>Once you've confirmed that everything works, and that all resources can be
successfully loaded, apply the <code>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp</code> HTTP
header to all documents including those that are embedded via iframes.</p>

<h3 id="determine-whether-isolation-succeeded-with-self.crossoriginisolated">Determine whether isolation succeeded with <code>self.crossOriginIsolated</code> </h3>
<p>The <code>self.crossOriginIsolated</code> property returns <code>true</code> when the web page is in a
cross-origin isolated state and all resources and windows are isolated within
the same browsing context group. You can use this API to determine whether you
have successfully isolated the browsing context group and gained access to
powerful features like <code>performance.measureMemory()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="debug-issues-using-chrome-devtools">Debug issues using Chrome DevTools </h3>
<p>For resources that are rendered on the screen such as images, it's fairly easy
to detect COEP issues because the request will be blocked and the page will
indicate a missing image. However, for resources that don't
necessarily have a visual impact, such as scripts or styles, COEP issues might
go unnoticed. For those, use the DevTools Network panel. If
there's an issue with COEP, you should see
<code>(blocked:NotSameOriginAfterDefaultedToSameOriginByCoep)</code> in the <strong>Status</strong>
column.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://webdev.imgix.net/coop-coep/devtools1.jpg" alt="COEP issues in the Status column of the Network panel.">
</figure>
<p>You can then click the entry to see more details.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://webdev.imgix.net/coop-coep/devtools2.jpg" alt="Details of the COEP issue are shown in the Headers tab after clicking a network resource in the Network panel.">
</figure>
<p>While COEP debugging is already available, COOP debugging in Chrome
DevTools is still <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1051466">being worked
on</a>.</p>
<h3 id="observe-issues-using-the-reporting-api">Observe issues using the Reporting API </h3>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/09/reportingapi">Reporting
API</a> is another
mechanism through which you can detect various issues. You can configure the
Reporting API to instruct your users' browser to send a report whenever COEP
blocks the loading of a resource. Chrome has supported the <code>Report-To</code> header since
version 69 for a variety of uses including COEP.</p>
<p>The Reporting API is undergoing transition to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/reporting/">a new
</a>version. Chrome is planning to release it
soon, but will leave the older API in place for some time.
Firefox is also <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1620573">considering the new
API</a>. You may want to use
both APIs during the transition.</p>
<p>To specify where the browser should send reports, append the <code>Report-To</code>
HTTP header to any document that is served with a COEP HTTP header. The
<code>Report-To</code> header also supports a few extra parameters to configure the
reports. For example:</p>
<web-copy-code><pre><code> { group: 'coep_rollout_1', max_age: 86400, endpoints: [{ url: 'https://first-party-test.glitch.me/report'}]}</code></pre>
</web-copy-code><p>The parameters object has three properties:</p>
<h4 id="group"><code>group</code> </h4>
<p>The <code>group</code> property names your various reporting endpoints. Use these names to
direct a subset of your reports. For instance, in the
<code>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy</code> directive you can specify the relevant endpoint
by providing the group name to <code>report-to=</code>. For example:</p>
<web-copy-code><pre><code> require-corp; report-to="coep_rollout_1"</code></pre>
</web-copy-code><p>When the browser encounters this, it will cross reference the <code>report-to</code> value
with the <code>group</code> property on the <code>Report-To</code> header to look up the endpoint.
This example cross references on <code>coep_rollout_1</code> to find the endpoint
<code>https://first-party-test.glitch.me/report</code>.</p>
<p>If you prefer to receive reports without blocking any embedded content, use
<code>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy-Report-Only</code> instead of
<code>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy</code>. For example:</p>
<web-copy-code><pre><code> require-corp; report-to="coep_rollout_1"</code></pre>
</web-copy-code><p>By doing this, when the browser detects cross origin resources that don't have
CORP or CORS, it sends a report using the Reporting API without actually
blocking those resources.</p>
<h4 id="max_age"><code>max_age</code> </h4>
<p>The <code>max_age</code> property specifies the time in seconds after which unsent reports
are to be dropped. The browser doesn't send the reports right away.
Instead, it transmits them out-of-band whenever there aren't any other higher
priority tasks. The <code>max_age</code> prevents the browser from sending reports that are
too stale to be useful. For example, <code>max_age: 86400</code> means that reports older
than twenty-four hours will not be sent.</p>
<h4 id="endpoints"><code>endpoints</code> </h4>
<p>The <code>endpoints</code> property specifies the URLs of one or more reporting endpoints.
The endpoint must accept CORS if it's hosted on a different origin. The browser
will send reports with a Content-Type of <code>application/reports+json</code>.</p>
<p>An example payload looks like this:</p>
<web-copy-code><pre><code><span>[</span><span>{</span><br>  age<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span><br>  body<span>:</span> <span>{</span><br>    'blocked-url'<span>:</span> 'https<span>:</span><br>    type<span>:</span> 'corp'<br>  <span>}</span><span>,</span><br>  type<span>:</span> 'coep'<span>,</span><br>  url<span>:</span> 'https<span>:</span><br>  …<br><span>}</span><span>]</span></code></pre>
</web-copy-code><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h2>
<p>Use a combination of COOP and COEP HTTP headers to opt a web page into a special
cross-origin isolated state. You will be able to examine
<code>self.crossOriginIsolated</code> to determine whether a web page is in a
cross-origin isolated state.</p>
<p>In upcoming releases of Chrome, this cross-origin isolated state will prevent
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#Changing_origin">altering
<code>document.domain</code></a>
and will give access to powerful features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.dev/monitor-total-page-memory-usage/"><code>performance.measureMemory</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling/">JS Self-Profiling API</a> and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll keep this post updated as new features are made available to this
cross-origin isolated state, and further improvements are made to DevTools
around COOP and COEP.</p>
