  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc-perf.png" alt="performance results"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler</th>
      <th>relative speed</th>

    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (OS-based)</td>
      <td>1.14</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These benchmarks include a wide variety of code, and the ones prefixed with <code>zzz_</code> are real-world
codebases or benchmarks:
the 
<a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(software)">Bullet</a>
physics engines, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremark">CoreMark</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a>
benchmarks, the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> VM (one GC and one computational benchmark),
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
and
<a href="https://zlib.net/">zlib</a>
compression libraries,
and the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>

<p>This section has a full example of WasmBoxC usage. Here are the source files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// my-code.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>// We could also include the .wasm.h file for these,</span>
<span>// but let's declare externs manually for the example.</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Initializing sandboxed unsafe library"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>();</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling twice on 21 returns %d</span><span>
</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>21</span><span>));</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling something bad now..."</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"(this will never be printed, as the bad thing will trap)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// unsafe-lib.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</span>
<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>twice</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>do_bad_thing</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Allocate an unknown size here (so the LLVM optimizer doesn't know if the</span>
  <span>// store later down is valid or not).</span>
  <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Write to an address that is definitely not in the sandbox (the default</span>
  <span>// memory size is much smaller), which in wasm will trap.</span>
  <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// Avoid the optimizer knowing the store can never be observed.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>twice()</code> does what you’d expect, and <code>do_bad_thing</code> does a store that will
definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to
remove the bad code as undefined behavior!)</p>

<p>And here’s how easy it is to use WasmBoxC to get a fully sandboxed library linked with our normal code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># build our main code to an object normally</span>
<span>$ </span>clang my-code.c         <span>-c</span> <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> my-code.o
<span># build the unsafe library to C with emcc</span>
<span>$ </span>emcc unsafe-lib.c          <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> unsafe-lib.wasm <span>-s</span> WASM2C <span>--no-entry</span>
<span># build the unsafe library's C to an object normally</span>
<span>$ </span>clang unsafe-lib.wasm.c <span>-c</span> <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> unsafe-lib.o
<span># link normally</span>
<span>$ </span>clang my-code.o unsafe-lib.o <span>-o</span> program
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty simple! The only “interesting” part here is that the second command uses
a wasm toolchain to compile the library to wasm and then to C. Here we use
<a href="http://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a>
(see the <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html">download instructions</a>
for how to get it; the zlib example in the next subsection also covers that). Note that there is
no <code>-c</code> there, since from <code>emcc</code>’s point of view it is a full compile+link to wasm,
after which it runs wasm2c for us, for which we pass <code>-s WASM2C</code>. Note also that
we tell it
<code>--no-entry</code> since we are building a library here.</p>

<p>Running <code>./program</code> (just a normal executable, no VM here!) we get this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./program
Initializing sandboxed unsafe library
Calling twice on 21 returns 42
Calling something bad now...
<span>[</span>wasm <span>trap </span>1, halting]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Exactly as expected!</p>

<p>Aside from it being easy to build code with WasmBoxC, it’s also easy to see
how it works: just read the generated C code. For example, we called
<code>Z_twiceZ_ii</code> earlier. If we’re curious what that is, we can just read the C
and see that aside from the function pointer indirection it’s just a plain C function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>u32</span> <span>w2c_twice</span><span>(</span><span>u32</span> <span>w2c_p0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// [..the code in the body, ending in a return..]</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see exactly what parameters it takes, what it returns, read the typedef
for <code>u32</code>, and so forth. The
actual compiled code in the body (omitted here) is not very readable, but it is still C code.
That lets us do things like add convenient printfs for debugging for example.
This is also why we said earlier that LTO can inline across the
sandbox: the sandboxed code is just more C code. Here is the call to <code>twice</code>
and the printing of its result (in LLVM IR, and before LLVM LTO):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>define</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@main</span><span>()</span> <span>#0</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[..]</span>
  <span>%2</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span> <span>i32</span> <span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>)*,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>)**</span> <span>@Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>,</span> <span>align</span> <span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>!tbaa</span> <span>!1</span>
  <span>%3</span> <span>=</span> <span>tail</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%2</span><span>(</span><span>i32</span> <span>21</span><span>)</span> <span>#8</span>
  <span>%4</span> <span>=</span> <span>tail</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>@printf</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span>
    <span>getelementptr</span> <span>inbounds</span> <span>([</span><span>32</span> <span>x</span> <span>i8</span><span>],</span> <span>[</span><span>32</span> <span>x</span> <span>i8</span><span>]*</span> <span>@.str</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and here is the result after LLVM LTO:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>define</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@main</span><span>()</span> <span>#0</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[..]</span>
  <span>%6</span> <span>=</span> <span>tail</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>@printf</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>nonnull</span> <span>dereferenceable</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>getelementptr</span> <span>inbounds</span> <span>([</span><span>32</span> <span>x</span> <span>i8</span><span>],</span> <span>[</span><span>32</span> <span>x</span> <span>i8</span><span>]*</span> <span>@.str</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>i32</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how before LTO we load a function pointer, then call that with <code>21</code>, then
<code>printf</code> that result. The function pointer is there because wasm2c emits very
flexible code, more than we need in fact. We may want to add an option to avoid
that indirection, but as you can see, LTO can fix that up already: in fact it
manages to replace the call to <code>twice(21)</code> to a constant <code>42</code> in <code>main</code>,
avoiding a call entirely!
Optimizing across the sandbox boundary can be hugely beneficial, and it’s
fully safe.</p>

<p>A final note on the emitted C code: if you do read it you’ll notice it doesn’t look very
optimized. That’s because wasm is very low level itself and wasm2c translates
it in a simple and accurate way — it doesn’t try to emit “optimal” C code.
That simplicity means that to be fast we
depend on C compiler optimizations, which is
why the example builds with <code>-O3</code>.</p>

<p>That also shows examples of how to do memory management in the sandbox,
which is very simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The “memory” seen by the sandboxed code is a single buffer of memory that is
<code>malloc</code>ed by the runtime. The sandboxing guarantees that the compiled code can
only access that buffer, and nothing else.</li>
  <li>Pointers in the sandbox are just 32-bit integers, which refer to locations in
that buffer.</li>
  <li>When you get a pointer from the sandbox, you can read that memory directly
(that is, there is nothing that prevents the outside from looking in). You can
do so by reading from the buffer at the offset of that pointer. That is, if
the buffer is at absolute (normal, not in the sandbox) address <code>BUF</code> and you want
to read data at the location a sandbox pointer of value <code>ptr</code> refers to, you
would read at absolute address <code>BUF + ptr</code>.</li>
  <li>The sandboxed code has its own <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>, which look normal to
that code, but only reserve and release ranges of memory in the singleton buffer.
If you want to pass some data into the sandbox, a simple way is to <code>malloc</code> in
the sandbox (using the sandbox’s <code>malloc</code>) and copy the data in.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-webassembly-toolchains">Other WebAssembly toolchains</h3>

<p>This could be even simpler if we used clang for
everything and not emcc. We can do that too!
There is nothing specific to Emscripten
about the WasmBoxC approach, all we need is a compiler to wasm, wasm2c, and
C runtime support for wasm2c’s output.
Plain clang could work too since it has wasm support; assuming you already use
clang, the only new build tool you’d need to add is wasm2c. Or you could
use the
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk">WASI SDK</a> or anything else.
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/11213">Adding wasm2c integration and runtime support in Emscripten</a>
was not too hard and it probably would be similar elsewhere.</p>

<p>I focused on Emscripten because I’ve already done the work to integrate
wasm2c there for
<a href="http://kripken.github.io/talks/2020/universal.html#/">other reasons</a>
anyhow. Emscripten also supports porting the
widest range of software currently which is how we could
run all the codebases mentioned in the benchmark section.
And Emscripten does a lot
of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lLqZR4ufSI">useful</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EOpX47PszpuYOtkFc5XzDiWEPelH1e-LARsOZ4Ax-0w/edit?ts=5e38b7e2#slide=id.g6e4f40de0f_0_38">optimizations</a>
to emit fast wasm which helps see how fast WasmBoxC can be.</p>



<h3 id="sfi">SFI</h3>

<p>Software Fault Isolation has already been mentioned in the introduction, with
WasmBoxC mainly differing from it in the use of wasm and compiling that through
C. As a result, one specific limitation in the WasmBoxC approach is that you must compile
the code from source, unlike SFI methods that can operate on a binary.</p>

<p>SFI using masking can achieve
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">overheads of 12%</a>, which
is significantly better than the 29% we observed. It is possible that WasmBoxC’s
masking sandboxing could be improved — no effort has gone into that yet.</p>

<h3 id="minsfi">MinSFI</h3>

<p>WasmBoxC is similar to
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/native-client-dev/xs4khSwhAso">MinSFI</a>
(itself inspired by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js">asm.js</a>, one of the predecessors of
wasm), whose key idea is to convert unsafe code to a sandboxed form. It does so on
LLVM IR, while WasmBoxC converts to wasm which is inherently sandboxed
(another example in this space is in
<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/psfi.pdf">Kroll, Stewart, and Appel, 2014</a>
which works on CompCert’s IR).</p>

<p>Most of the work in such an approach is to properly define the sandboxed form
(without making any security mistakes),
and to implement it (which means a lot of tooling work — we need to be
able to convert real-world code to that form). When MinSFI was created wasm didn’t
yet exist, and there wasn’t a good alternative, but today wasm fits that need
very well: all the hard work of speccing and implementing it has been done, and
we can just use that in WasmBoxC.</p>

<h3 id="rlbox-wasm">RLBox-wasm</h3>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00572.pdf">RLBox</a>
describes a framework for fine-grain isolation of untrusted code. One of the
isolation mechanisms (see section 9 in the paper) uses wasm;
call that “RLBox-wasm”.</p>

<p>Like RLBox-wasm, WasmBoxC compiles to wasm and then to native code.
The difference is how the native code is generated. RLBox-wasm uses a customized build of
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/lucet">Lucet</a> which uses
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/master/cranelift">CraneLift</a> to
generate native code, while WasmBoxC compiles to C and then
uses a standard C compiler like clang or gcc. To consider the performance
difference caused by that, let’s look at this quote from the RLBox paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We find that Wasm sandboxing [using RLBox with Lucet] imposes a 85% overhead [..] We attribute this slowdown largely to the nascent Wasm toolchains, which don’t yet support performance optimization on par with, say LLVM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WasmBoxC offers a useful comparison point in this context since it can use LLVM.
Indeed, as WasmBoxC has 14%-42% overhead, it
supports the quote’s assertion that a large part of RLBox-wasm’s current 85%
overhead is due to CraneLift being fairly new (but it is
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1539399">making good progress</a>).
(However, RLBox-wasm is only measured on one benchmark, libGraphite, which
limits our ability to generalize.)</p>

<p>Another performance difference between RLBox-wasm and WasmBoxC is that RLBox-wasm
has trampolines between the sandbox and the outside. Normally such trampolines
do context and stack switching, etc., and can have significant overhead. In
RLBox-wasm they use a
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/1126">custom trampoline in Lucet</a>
 which reduced the overhead by
800%, almost to nothing.
In comparison, with WasmBoxC as we saw earlier the sandboxed code is just plain C
and there are no trampolines at all, and even inlining across the boundary works.</p>

<p>An advantage RLBox-wasm has is that CraneLift is a dedicated wasm compiler, and
so it may use techniques specific to wasm. For example, it might pin a register
for the sandboxed memory, or it might use a nonstandard calling convention inside
the sandbox. Those things could not be done with plain C code with WasmBoxC.
For now it looks like LLVM’s general advantage outweighs using a wasm-specific
compiler, but in time that might change.</p>

<p>Another advantage RLBox-wasm has over WasmBoxC is build times: WasmBoxC compiles to
C and then runs a full C compiler while CraneLift is designed to compile wasm
to native code.
The WasmBoxC approach
inherently adds extra steps in the compilation process. However, as mentioned
throughout this post, going through C has benefits not just to speed but also to
ease of use, so overall there are interesting tradeoffs in this space.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: It
<a href="https://twitter.com/deiandelmars/status/1287794353490911233">was pointed out to me</a>
that an
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02285.pdf">early version of RLBox</a> in January 2019
used wasm2c, which I was not aware of.</p>

<h2 id="current-status">Current status</h2>

<h3 id="security">Security</h3>

<p>How secure is WasmBoxC? As with anything new you should assume it is experimental
for now. However, it is built on well-tested foundations, in particular, wasm itself,
wasm toolchain components like clang, and standard C compilers. The key wasm2c
component has not been used in production yet to my knowledge, but good
indications are that wasm2c passes the
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite">wasm spec test suite</a> which covers many
sandboxing and portability corner cases, and we’ve
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/pull/2772">fuzzed</a>
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/pull/2791">it</a>.</p>

<p>Another useful thing is that the C output can be inspected for safety. It’s easy to see that all memory accesses go
through the same few load/store methods, and that those are guaranteed to stay
within the sandbox. While C isn’t a memory-safe language, the very simple form of C we emit
should in fact be safe and easily seen as such.</p>

<p>It would be great for security people to take a look at WasmBoxC — please help out!</p>

<h3 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h3>

<p>In terms of what code can be sandboxed right now, in the current implementation it’s
basically anything Emscripten can port to wasm, which is quite a lot — it’s used
to port many entire
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-gettingstarted.html">game</a>
<a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/compiling_for_web.html">engines</a>,
for example, and as we saw it can port all the codebases we benchmarked.
In particular it includes support for most of the C
and C++ languages and standard libraries, including tricky things like
<code>setjmp</code> (which is needed for Lua). However, a few things Emscripten
supports have not been enabled in WasmBoxC yet, like C++ exceptions
and pthreads.</p>

<h3 id="other-limitations">Other limitations</h3>

<p>wasm2c output is a simple subset of C, and it builds with gcc or clang on all
machines I’ve tested,
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/909">but it doesn’t work on MSVC yet</a>
(at the moment it uses some gcc/clang intrinsics like <code>__builtin_expect</code>).
Help is welcome in implementing support for that compiler and others!</p>

<p>A concrete limitation right now of WasmBoxC is that while a single C file is
nice and simple, for a large project it can compile pretty slowly, especially
when optimizing. I’ve generated
C files that take clang and gcc
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262166778848763904">minutes to compile</a>
(others have seen
<a href="https://twitter.com/whitequark/status/1263015563028303873">even worse</a>).
This is unfair to those compilers,
of course, since C compilers aren’t expected to parallelize inside each source file.
We could look into optionally emitting separate files in wasm2c to avoid that.</p>

<h2 id="api-questions">API questions</h2>

<p>I don’t have many thoughts on this side as it isn’t really my area. I
mostly just left the current wasm2c C API as it is, which is where those
<code>Z_</code> name manglings come from. You can use WasmBoxC right now, but you need
to work at a fairly low level in C to bridge your code and the sandboxed code.
Higher-level things are possible: The
<a href="https://plsyssec.github.io/rlbox_sandboxing_api/sphinx/#">RLBox people</a>
have done a lot of interesting work in this space on automation, tainting, etc.,
and the
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/03/open-sourcing-sandboxed-api.html">Sandboxed API</a>
is another approach that provides convenient and safe APIs for interacting
with sandboxed code.</p>

<p>A specific example of something that could be improved is files. When doing sandboxing like this you
don’t want to give the sandboxed code file access, and the current implementation
of course prevents that. If you sandbox a library that does need file data, the usual
pattern is to malloc inside the sandbox and copy data over to it (as is done
in the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/kripken/2d982aede096e456591b2821a9d41b31#file-main-c-L80">gist example of zlib</a>).
There may be better things we can do, like bundling of data files.</p>

<p>On the topic of files, you can enable support for them optionally, which is how
the benchmarks were run: Lua needs to load files, and SQLite also needs to write and
seek in its database file. Currently when <code>emcc</code> is used with the
<code>WASM2C</code> flag it will fully sandbox things if you build a library (for
which as we saw you should pass <code>--no-entry</code>), while if you build a normal
executable with a <code>main()</code> then it gives the code normal OS access. We probably
want to think about a better design here, but meanwhile this has been useful
for testing and benchmarking, and also
<a href="http://kripken.github.io/talks/2020/universal.html#/">as a way to get portable builds</a>.</p>

<h2 id="safe-languages">Safe languages</h2>

<p>WasmBoxC may be especially
interesting with a memory-safe language like Rust, Swift, or Go because it can help remove the
unsafety of C libraries which would otherwise mar the security of an application
written almost entirely in a safe language.</p>

<p>In fact, these languages generally have a bindings generator for C libraries.
Perhaps the build system could have an option to WasmBox a library and
generate appropriate bindings for it automatically? That would be as
convenient as the hypothetical <code>--sandbox</code> flag we wished for in the introduction!
If it’s that easy, and since the WasmBoxC overhead is so low, perhaps
sandboxing of C libraries could become a common practice in safe languages? (I’d
love to collaborate on this if someone is interested!)</p>

<p>Another interesting possibility here might be to compile not to C but to the
memory-safe language itself, see for example
<a href="https://github.com/CryZe/wasm-to-rust">wasm-to-rust</a>. That would let you do
everything in the safe language with no C at all. That wouldn’t make the
sandboxing itself any more secure, but it could prevent bugs in the interface code,
and might be more convenient.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The title of this post describes WasmBoxC as “<strong>Simple, Easy, and Fast VM-less Sandboxing</strong>”.
<em>Simplicity</em> is the key from which all the rest of the benefits come:
WasmBoxC compiles to a simple subset of C and it does so
in a simple way, using existing wasm toolchains.
By compiling to C we can run a C compiler on it which is easy and
gives us fast code. It also makes it easy to
communicate with the sandbox. And by using existing wasm toolchains we have well-tested and convenient
compilers that let us build and sandbox code in an easy way.</p>

<p>I’m not aware of a sandboxing approach that is easier to use than WasmBoxC. And it’s
interesting that we can reach just 14%-42% overhead with such a simple approach!
It turns out that we can be both simple and fast.</p>
