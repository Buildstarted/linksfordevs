<h2>Security Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>HIGH</strong>: An endpoint in the GitHub API would disclose sensitive user information in its error response. The disclosed information included authentication tokens that could be used to authenticate as unauthorized users. An authenticated user on the instance would be required to access to the affected API. </li>

<li><strong>LOW</strong>: Assigned issues in another users private repository could appear in an issues search. </li>
<li>Packages have been updated to the latest security versions. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>/var/log/github/exceptions.log</code> file could include a large number of <code>QueryWarningLogger::QueryWarning</code> errors. </li>
<li>Organizations imported with <code>ghe-migrator</code> were not added to the global enterprise account. </li>
<li>The diff context for diffs that included submodules would sometimes load incorrect content. </li>
</ul>

<li>'Business Account' has been renamed to 'Enterprise Account'. </li>
<li>The user/organization dashboard is now full-width and responsive. </li>

</ul>

<h2>Backups and Disaster Recovery</h2>

<p>GitHub Enterprise Server 2.17 requires at least <a href="https://github.com/github/backup-utils">GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities</a> 2.17.0 for <a href="https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.17/admin/guides/installation/backups-and-disaster-recovery/">Backups and Disaster Recovery</a>.</p>

<h2>Upcoming deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 2.14</h2>

<p><strong>GitHub Enterprise Server 2.14 will be deprecated as of July 12, 2019.</strong> That means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, <a href="https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.17/admin/guides/installation/upgrading-github-enterprise/">upgrade to the newest version of GitHub Enterprise Server</a> as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Deprecation of GitHub Services</h2>

<p>Starting with GitHub Enterprise Server 2.17.0, support for GitHub Services is now deprecated and administrators will not be able to install or configure new GitHub Services. Existing GitHub Services from a previous version of GitHub Enterprise Server will continue to function but GitHub Enterprise Server will not be providing any security or bug fixes to the GitHub Services functionality. At this time, there will be no changes to the existing functionality, but a warning banner is displayed with the <a href="https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-04-25-github-services-deprecation/">deprecation announcement blog post</a>. Administrators can see which repositories are using GitHub Services with <code>ghe-legacy-github-services-report</code>.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user. </li>
<li>Custom firewall rules aren't maintained during an upgrade. </li>
<li>Subversion (SVN) checkout may timeout while the repository data cache is being built. In most cases, subsequent svn checkout attempts will succeed. </li>
<li>Git LFS tracked files <a href="https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories">uploaded through the web interface</a> are incorrectly added directly to the repository. </li>
<li>Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters. </li>
<li>Resque workers may not be cleaned up following a configuration run leading to a growing number of stale workers which in turn could lead to high memory consumption. </li>
<li>Adding a new node to a currently or previously configured high availability replication primary node that has been upgraded to GitHub Enterprise Server 2.17 may fail due to a missing <code>/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/openssl.cnf</code> file. (updated: 2019-06-19)<br></li>
<li>Hypervisor type and root volumes are incorrectly detected on AWS Nitro instance types, preventing non-hotpatch upgrades. (updated: 2019-07-09) </li>
<li>Lines in gists are not selectable. (updated: 2019-07-19) </li>
</ul>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<ul>
<li>The ability for Organization admins to restrict email notifications for activity within their organization is not included in GitHub Enterprise Server 2.17.0.</li>
</ul>
