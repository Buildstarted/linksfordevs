First, this switch is designed to be used in a managed environment via the UniFi Controller software.  It is NOT designed to be a standalone switch that you directly manage (see the Ubiquiti Edge Switches for that).  Second, there is this switch (US-8) and the US-8-60W.  The US-8 is a PoE-powered switch with one PoE pass through port.  In other words, this switch can be powered by INPUT via PoE and it can OUTPUT PoE power to one other port.  The US-8-60W is a more traditional switch that requires wall power and has 4 ports that can OUTPUT PoE power.<p>Since this is a PoE-powered switch -- if you have a "core" switch that provides PoE, you can power this little US-8 via PoE via the core and without a wall adapter.  Why would you want this feature?  I have my core switch on a large UPS that can power it for hours.  By using PoE-powered edge switches, those edge switches stay powered in a power failure without having to put a UPS at each one.  Also, I have some places where I don't have wall power handy.  That said, the US-8 comes with a regular wall transformer that can power the switch instead of input PoE.  I did some testing and the US-8 unfortunately will NOT hot-swap between PoE power and wall power.  So if your US-8 first powered up with the wall adapter but also has PoE input power, and you unplug the wall adapter, the switch has to reset itself (and drop connectivity) to transition to using the PoE input power.</p><p>This US-8 also has a pass-thru PoE (output) port on #8.  Port 8 has PoE output turned OFF by default.</p><p>So, to summarize the PoE situation, this switch can accept PoE INPUT on Port #1 to power the US-8 and can be configured to OUTPUT PoE on port #8.  I found this very useful where I had only one ethernet drop to an area for a PoE cam and wanted to add a Smart TV via ethernet without losing the PoE cam.</p><p>All 8 ports are gigabit and I get expected throughput via the US-8.</p><p>I'm very pleased and have deployed a bunch of these in my home/home-office.</p></span>

After installing this product, along with one of their PoE switches to power it, I replaced all the networking equipment in my house with Ubiquiti products.  They are that good.  It is silly to use anything else.<p>A few things to be aware of.  Unifi is a product line of Ubiquiti.  Products in the Unifi line all use the same controller software and can be seen by the software.  But products that are not in the Unifi line, such as the ER Lite router, will not be seen by the controller software.  So make sure you buy products from the same product family, which is probably Unifi unless you are a global corporation.</p><p>Why are Ubiquiti products so much better than consumer grade products?  Because they can handle more than 100 Mbps connections, which are becoming more common now, because they can be managed, configured, and upgraded via controller software, because you can see the Wifi coverage in your house, because the Wifi access points coordinate with each other to hand off client connections.  It is like being reborn.  Say goodbye to network problems.</p></span>

I went all-in with Ubi-gear and kitted out my network setup with:<br>- 60W Powered Switch<br>- 12W PoE Switch (this device)<br>-  AP-PRO<p>The 60W model powers the 12W via PoE in and also functions as the trunk line. The 12W model powers devices in the office. Two PoE ports remain on the 60W model that can be used to power more 12W switches and/or other access points. Wonderful gear and the controller software is only getting better everyday. I run the controller software on an on-premise server. However, the Cloud-Key device is a tempting offer for $75 and it could be powered off of a PoE port.</p><p>The options are endless! If you want a high-end single point of view to manage all of your networking equipment, look no further. I use a pfSense router so any options in the controller that require a USG are greyed out. This does NOT impact switch performance at all.</p><p>10/10 recommend if you are technically inclined. The setup process is not consumer friendly.</p></span>

I've got a couple media cabinets where it just wasn't feasible to pull 6+ lines...  So I threw these in.  Sure, there's only the one Gb uplink so I'm theoretically losing bandwidth...  But the odds of any of this equipment saturating a Gb link - much less multiple Gb links at once - are pretty slim.<p>The US-8 switch ships with a big, bulky power adapter that seems like overkill for such a small switch...  But I'm not using it.  I'm using PoE to power these switches, and it works great.  No need to supply power for these switches.  No extra outlets or surge strips.</p><p>Setup is very easy.  They're configured to pass traffic right out of the box, so they're functional even if you don't do any configuration.  But configuring them is also easy...  Just log into your Unifi controller, adopt them, and you're ready to go.</p><p>I don't know that I'd recommend a US-8 for a non-Unifi installation...  Just because I think you lose a lot of the functionality you're paying for.</p><p>But, otherwise, it's a fantastic product.</p></span>

I use them personally and for my clients.  I have the Unifi USG, 24 port PoE switch and 3 of their APs.  I liked the setup (latest software) so much I decided to replace a couple of my smaller switches with the US-8 UniFi.  I really like the switches size and management, but this little switch runs way too hot.  I had to elevate one side of the switch to try and keep it cooler. I am almost worried the switch runs so hot, I can't imagine the PoE version of this thing.  So 4 Stars due to the heat issue, otherwise this switch is amazing!!!</span>
