<article>
<p>Adam Savage is returning to Discovery and Science Channels with a new series.</p>
<p>The former <em>MythBusters</em> and <em>Unchained Reaction</em> co-host will "take on the biggest and baddest builds of his career" in <em>Savage Builds,</em> which is set to debut in June.</p>
<p>The eight-episode series, which will premiere on Science and then air afterward on Discovery, finds Savage combining his "insatiable curiosity and nearly unparalleled inventiveness" as he attempts to build working, innovative items such as a 3D-printed titanium suit of armor inspired by the Iron Man films that actually flies or experiments with highly volatile liquid nitroglycerin. Each episode will focus on one project as Adam collaborates with notable experts in their fields, friends, colleagues and others.</p>
<p>"I've spent my life trying to make, create and push the boundaries of what's possible," said Savage. "This new series is a culmination of sorts, as I get to work with some of the most brilliant minds out there as we attempt to solve really absurd ideas that I've had in my head for a long time, but have never had the opportunity to dive into, until now. And of course, the most absurd ideas are often what generate the most innovative engineering."</p>
<p>Episodes include Savage's attempt to create a working version of one of history's most notorious engineering failures, the British military's World War II rocket-propelled explosive weapon, The Great Panjandrum. Helping with the design is the lead engineer of the Mars Science Lab’s EDL (Entry, Descent, Landing phase), NASA engineer Adam Steltzner.</p>
<p>For the titanium Iron-Man inspired suit Adam enlists Richard Browning, famous for his Gravity Jet Suit, which is powered by five 1,000-horsepower mini jet engines strapped to his body.</p>
<p>Inventor, maker and roboticist Simone Giertz and maker Laura Kampf help Adam build three Mad Max-inspired, postapocalyptic monsters of destruction using only junk cars and the materials they can salvage from a scrapyard.</p>
<p>"Adam's enthusiasm for science is contagious,” said Nancy Daniels, chief brand officer at Discovery and Factual. "<em>Savage Builds</em> is the perfect showcase for him to do what he loves to do on a scale that hasn't been done before."</p>
<p>For 14 seasons, from 2003 to 2016, Savage co-hosted the popular series <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/science-channel-reviving-mythbusters-seeking-879292" target="_blank"><em>MythBusters</em></a> with Jamie Hyneman, in which the pair used science to put various myths and rumors to the test. The duo also co-hosted the 2012 game show <em>Unchained Reaction.</em></p>
<p>The series is produced by Whalerock Industries. Executive producers for Whalerock are Savage, Lloyd Braun, Chris Cowan and John Tessier. Executive producer for Science is Wyatt Channell.</p>
