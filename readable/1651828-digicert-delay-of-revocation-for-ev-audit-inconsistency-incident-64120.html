<div id="c0"><div id="ct-0" data-comment-id="14928685" data-ismarkdown="true"><h2>Incident Report – Mozilla Policy Violation</h2>
<ol>
<li>How your CA first became aware of the problem (e.g. via a problem report submitted to your Problem Reporting Mechanism, a discussion in mozilla.dev.security.policy, a Bugzilla bug, or internal self-audit), and the time and date.</li>
</ol>
<p>We filed the bug <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1650910">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1650910</a> for inconsistent EV audits.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>A timeline of the actions your CA took in response. A timeline is a date-and-time-stamped sequence of all relevant events. This may include events before the incident was reported, such as when a particular requirement became applicable, or a document changed, or a bug was introduced, or an audit was done.</li>
</ol>
<p>06-July-2020: Bug filed for EV inconsistent audits.<br>
07-July-2020: Impacted customers were notified.<br>
07-July through 09-July 2020:  Had discussions with customers on operational risk and impact for revocations to be actioned within the 5-day window.</p>
<p>We have gathered the feedback so far from all impacted customers and filing this bug for a delay in revocation. We wanted to file this early given the reasons for the delay and to get the thoughts of the browsers about the additional compliance issue (of failing to revoke). For a majority of the customers, we are able to execute on the Saturday, July 11th deadline, but the infrastructure and use of certificates by others makes the ecosystem impact significant that we felt it would be appropriate to take another compliance hit by stating our case for the delay. We provided the reasons why and certificate estimates are in 6) below.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Whether your CA has stopped, or has not yet stopped, issuing certificates with the problem. A statement that you have will be considered a pledge to the community; a statement that you have not requires an explanation.</li>
</ol>
<p>As noted in our prior filed bug (1650910): DigiCert has halted all EV issuance across CAs omitted from an EV audit report. All EV issuance from these are on ICAs that will be covered in an EV audit.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>A summary of the problematic certificates. For each problem: number of certs, and the date the first and last certs with that problem were issued.</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on the details provided, revocation is expected and required within the timeframe defined, as an industry-wide requirement.</p>
<p>We refined our data and searching for impacted certificates and found the approximated number in the previous bug was incorrect as it included all revoked and expired certificates. The total number of valid certificates is roughly 35,000. We are revoking most of these by the deadline, but the ones that support critical infrastructure dealing with the pandemic or that fall under the banking regulations needed more time.</p>
<p>Scheduled to revoke on July 11th: ~26,000 certificates<br>
Scheduled to revoke on July 16th: ~4000 certificates<br>
Scheduled to revoke on July 30th: ~4000 certificates</p>
<p>There are several that are asking for 45 days from the initial event.  We have explained to these requests violate the industry requirements that we adhere to, but given the extraordinary situation of 2020, we thought we’d like to raise it here.  Most of the 45 day requests involve a point of sales device, an ATM, or similar device that is using the WebPKI for non-web purposes. We recognize the need to separate non-web from web application and are exploring how to do that better. For now, we have recommended to customers using non-web devices that they replace their certificate with a separate root of trust.</p>
<p>5.The complete certificate data for the problematic certificates. The recommended way to provide this is to ensure each certificate is logged to CT and then list the fingerprints or crt.sh IDs, either in the report or as an attached spreadsheet, with one list per distinct problem.</p>
<p>We plan on posting the full list of serial numbers that will not meet the revocation deadline on Saturday. It is unlikely this number will be zero.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Explanation about how and why the mistakes were made or bugs introduced, and how they avoided detection until now.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several factors that lead to us not meeting the revocation deadline of five days. The sheer volume is probably the number one reason. We realize that is not a a sufficient reason alone and have not made decisions on delayed revocation for volume of certificates solely.   The primary reasons are based on operational risks and impact as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>More time to coordinate with third parties. Some of these are not operated by the requester or are distributed to third parties. Several payment and banking institutions require lead time to do testing, approval, and sign off. This reason is cited in the previous bug related to the underscore issue. Although we have mentioned this is essentially a SEV1 situation, the sign off process prevents a rapid replacement of installed certificates.</li>
<li>COVID and ongoing lockdown restrictions. Accessing the data center and getting staff available at key locations has taken longer than expected simply because people are not available or are unable to travel at this time. A third of the certificates in this group are actively being used to monitor COVID patients and can’t have an outage.</li>
<li>Regulatory bodies. Mobile banking applications, payment systems processing salaries, supplier payments, and online services run by financial institutions require some form of change process controlled by regulatory bodies. We are researching where these regulations may require more than 5 days. If this is true, then it would conflict with the policy and be something to present to the CAB forum as a conflict with local law. More likely the regulations just involve sufficient burden that it makes 5-day replacements impractical rather than impossible. Changing a cert on a mobile browser does require significant effort to have the update pushed to end users.</li>
<li>US Government operations. Several of these certificates are key to the operations of the US government. These require approval. Although they have not stated that COVID is delaying approval, the approval process looks like it is taking longer than the five days.</li>
<li>Pinned applications. A majority of the delayed revocation relates to pinned certificates where they need to figure out how to change the pinning of the cert. These are the ones we’d like to revoke on July 30. They have mentioned the pins don’t expire by then. We are working with them to see what we can do to still revoke within July.</li>
<li>Tax season impact. With tax season deadline this year delayed, several tax organizations are on a freeze until July 15th.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although we haven’t listed numbers here, we are gathering how many certificates fall into each reason  and will provide the serial numbers based on reason category on or before July 11th.</p>
<p>7.List of steps your CA is taking to resolve the situation and ensure such issuance will not be repeated in the future, accompanied with a timeline of when your CA expects to accomplish these things.</p>
<p>We acknowledge and accept that the requirement is 5-days and that we are committed to upholding industry mandated timelines. However, we couldn’t make it happen for the reasons stated above.  Although we couldn’t manage to comply with the requirements on this particular issue, we do feel delaying the revocation in a few cases are justifiable considering the severe impact. We’re hoping for a response from the browsers about the next steps and their thoughts on the delay. We will continue to provide updates and working to still accelerate revocation and replacement over the next few days. As part of this remediation, we would like to take an active role in separating out non-web PKI from the web and are looking for recommendations on how to better accomplish that task. We are also promoting use of automation as a key part of any certificate solution, including investing more in improving our ACME and other certificate automation tools.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I mean, browsers can't and don't grant exceptions. Any failure to revoke would be a serious compliance issue that would impact trust in a CA going forward, even if it may not lead to immediate distrust. As we've seen from CAs that have a series of compliance issues, continuing to have compliance issues can ultimately result in loss of trust of the CA entirely.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To be clear: This is not about "taking a hit". This is about demonstrating what makes this situation <strong>exceptional</strong>, which in this case is generally meant "unprecedented, new, or novel". This is touched on at <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Responding_To_An_Incident#Revocation" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Responding_To_An_Incident#Revocation</a> with the expectations, and I don't think this incident really rises to that.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I think there's concern about whether or not we can retroactively consider an EV audit having resolved this, so revocation is indeed the right answer. The response for dealing with such audit inconsistencies has, historically, been to revoke the entire intermediate and start fresh, due to the loss of trust and confidence. Revoking only the affected certificates appears to be a less-impactful option, and it's up to DigiCert to demonstrate that would sufficiently mitigate concerns, versus revoking the entire intermediate.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The traditional response for dealing with such "non-web purposes" has been to revoke the intermediate via OneCRL. While Mozilla has seen this as an appropriate remediation, other browsers, including Google, have recognized that it fails to protect the broader ecosystem. While this may offer a viable alternative to revoking only the EV certificates, by revoking the intermediate in Firefox, I suspect that despite customer assertions, they are likely using them in the Web.</p>
<p>This specific use case is, as DigiCert knows, not one unfamiliar.</p>

<p>This is not a new response for DigiCert, so I fail to see how these circumstances are exceptional. The same response was provided in the past - e.g. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156561" title="VERIFIED FIXED - javascript:prompt() dialog shows a weird disabled checkbox and bullets">Bug 156561</a> - and DigiCert is no stranger to the concerns around exceptional events, such as those from <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1516453" title="RESOLVED FIXED - DigiCert: Underscores - Discover">Bug 1516453</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1517617" title="RESOLVED FIXED - DigiCert: Underscores - Citi">Bug 1517617</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1516599" title="RESOLVED FIXED - DigiCert: Underscores - Ericsson">Bug 1516599</a>, or <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1516545" title="RESOLVED FIXED - DigiCert: Underscores - Verizon">Bug 1516545</a>. While DigiCert provided the experience in these past issues, I think the same response would be applicable regardless of the CA, as all CAs use these incident reports to better inform their policies and practices and ensure their Subscribers are appraised of the risks.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In the past, DigiCert had committed that this would not be an issue going forward. I'd be concerned if the steps DigiCert took a year ago, to move such customers off, as all publicly-trusted CAs were expected to do, were insufficient.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>COVID and ongoing lockdown restrictions. Accessing the data center and getting staff available at key locations has taken longer than expected simply because people are not available or are unable to travel at this time. A third of the certificates in this group are actively being used to monitor COVID patients and can’t have an outage.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In the past, DigiCert had committed that datacenter access issues were not going to be an issue going forward, by deploying and promoting automation solutions. It seems these Subscribers made an intentional choice not to adopt these practices to mitigate the risk?</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Regulatory bodies. Mobile banking applications, payment systems processing salaries, supplier payments, and online services run by financial institutions require some form of change process controlled by regulatory bodies.

More likely the regulations just involve sufficient burden that it makes 5-day replacements impractical rather than impossible. Changing a cert on a mobile browser does require significant effort to have the update pushed to end users.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I think browsers would take a particularly dim view of such an approach. I think a CA that either failed to do their due dilligence in ascertaining whether customers posed such risk, or actively courted such customers, would be an existential risk to the continued trust of that CA. The reason is that the same reasoning could be seeing as actively promoting the issuance of MITM certificates, which is also explicitly forbidden, by attempting to use "local law" as a justification.</p>
<p>The clauses with respect to 9.16.3 are meant to be exceptional, and disclosed beforehand, which is explicitly noted as a SHALL requirement. By issuing the certificate, the sevrability clause was not exercised.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>US Government operations. Several of these certificates are key to the operations of the US government. These require approval. Although they have not stated that COVID is delaying approval, the approval process looks like it is taking longer than the five days.</li>

These are the ones we’d like to revoke on July 30. They have mentioned the pins don’t expire by then. We are working with them to see what we can do to still revoke within July.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is unacceptable. There has been sufficient communication, to CAs, about the risk of pinning. CAs cannot be seen as responsible for their Subscribers misusing that CAs certificates, nor can the community be seen as a having to bear that risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>Tax season impact. With tax season deadline this year delayed, several tax organizations are on a freeze until July 15th.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>DigiCert, and the CAs they acquired, such as Symantec, have used this explanation in the past. This would be a serious regression, and if it turned out these customers were previous Symantec customers, this would pose significant risk to the continued trust of DigiCert, who committed to the broader community that the set of issues that ultimately lead to the loss of trust in Symantec, some of which were intentional choices by Symantec to prioritize customers over behaving in a trustworthy fashion, would not similarly plague DigiCert.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re hoping for a response from the browsers about the next steps and their thoughts on the delay. We will continue to provide updates and working to still accelerate revocation and replacement over the next few days.

<p>DigiCert already committed to this, a year ago. I think it's disheartening to think that there has been no progress. I understand that the relationship between DigiCert and its customers is complex, but it's precisely because these were things DigiCert already committed to in light of past incidents that it should have been able to highlight to current customers that there could be no future incidents without impacting DigiCert's trust.</p>
<p>I realize that customers of DigiCert will be directed to this, and perhaps chime in on why it's unreasonable to have expectations at all, and shouldn't everything be treated bespoke. We have requirements to treat CAs consistently, fairly, and to have an objective standard of trustworthiness. There is nothing inherent to a CA that prevents these obligations from being met: they are design trade-offs a CA knowingly makes. These expectations have been stable for years, and CAs that have struggled to meet the expectation in the past, such as DigiCert, have been given time to design systems to better align. Certificates that cannot be replaced within the time specified, by their very existence, pose a serious threat to the ability to respond. Just like we don't purchase fire insurance once our house is on fire, and expect everything to be OK, we don't wait to implement good practices until the serious security incident is here. The ecosystem has already faced a number of significant security events, from DigiNotar to Heartbleed to Symantec's distrust, and each of these reveal inadequacies in the system  that CAs are supposed to be working to correct.</p>
<p>The choice on whether to revoke or not is, ultimately, DigiCert's, and that's called out in <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Responding_To_An_Incident#Revocation" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Responding_To_An_Incident#Revocation</a> . But I think DigiCert is very aware of the serious concerns that have come up, both with their CA and the broader trend of CAs that have attempted to have "the ecosystem" pick up the tab for CA's and customers decisions, and we have to move past that. When customers make a decision to use a publicly trusted CA, that CA is expected to explain their policies, which they do, as part of the Subscriber Agreement and CP/CPS. If the customer still uses the product, in a way that it's not intended for nor safe to use, it cannot be seen as "someone else's fault" when things go awry.</p>
<p>The policies that ensure prompt revocation keep all sites safe. They're the same policies that help protect your sites from hackers or abuse, by ensuring that if there were certificates you did not authorize, they are promptly revoked. The reason we expect consistency, regardless of severity, is precisely because the moment "severity" becomes an area for determining policy, we encourage CAs to adopt selectively-lax policies, which increases the risk, for everyone, of more high-severity incidents. This isn't theory, it's the exact system browsers have been trying to fix for the past 15 years, after the well-published "PKI race to the bottom" that ultimately resulted in DigiNotar: a series of "minor" issues that created an opportunity for a major, company-ending issue.</p>
<p>If DigiCert decides not to revoke, the burden rests on demonstrating why this is exceptional. Analyzing past incident reports, from DigiCert and other CAs, to see whether similar issues were encountered or similar commitments were made, is essential. This is because DigiCert will need to demonstrate, per-Subscriber, why the situation is exceptional, and have a comprehensive plan to prevent this underlying issue from happening again. Not ideas, but a timeline with concrete plans. For those customers that need additional time, it'll be important to identify specifically who they are and what steps they're taking, in order to ensure they don't simply shift to a new CA and cause the same compliance issues at a new CA.</p>
<p>I realize COVID-19 is truly exceptional here, and this understandably creates a host of challenges. The only information to determine whether something is reasonable or not is based on what's provided in these incidents, the analysis and comparison to past incidents, and the commitments going forward. I remain deeply concerned on this issue, with the information available, because it feels like either "We don't know how to solve this" or "We aren't willing to solve this and hoping browsers will be the 'bad guy' on this" or, worse, "our customers don't understand how harmful to the security of all users what they're asking for is". I suspect that, if there is any delay, specific commitments from those customers, which can help better improve the security for all users, would be a minimum bar to expect.</p>

We are explaining the timing that must get elongated given the information collected about the challenges that the current situation with COVID-19 and operational risk that has been placed on these organizations.  DigiCert remains committed to upholding the standards set forth for us as a CA and are not requesting delays for non-exceptional circumstances.  These examples of operational risk compounded by the pandemic constraints with timing are noted below.<br>
For those planned to be revoked and replaced by July 30th, here are some of the key reasons why revocations for about 10% of impacted organizations will happen later than we would like:</p>
<p>927 are from a large global banking entity (subject of certificate serial number 0474137bf2bdb2d9a4f6a101721b5f67) that services ATMs and payment terminals as well as US Federal government facing applications and required to go through a stringent change management process and are impacted by availability of personal to perform these changes due to COVID.</p>
<p>1,068 relate to a multinational bank (subjects of certificate serial numbers 09f3088bed65f0a4875d01be76d6499c) that are in lockdown and can’t apply the changes fast enough. The majority of their certificates are used on mobile banking applications.</p>
<p>269 are for a specific case for a national tax services firm (subject of certificate serial number 040B0C1B2601AB81A03AEEFE853F1F78) working with the COVID impacted organizations especially who are delayed in completing their government required paperwork. They are the primary users of these apps which are in a freeze to service this category of customers that was focused in many cases on life saving activities.</p>
<p>136 are related to a Federal Financial Institution (subject of certificate serial number 0E389CADFDFA0866D405FB74614B51BF) that also are impacted by requiring to work with 3rd party institutions which would have severe impact during the tax season deadline.</p>
<p>182 are for certificates (subject of certificate serial number 010F5E5FE3E12685FAFB44476AE525A9) impacting almost half a million mobile banking customers that need access to do banking online during shelter-in-place/lockdown.</p>
<p>89 certificates are from a global banking entity (subject of certificate serial number 0DCE177ABC35A92E36F7676ECADA2F13) that has mobile banking applications, payment systems processing salaries, supplier payments, online services for clients to manage their finances etc. and will impact many clients in US, Europe and Asia Pacific.  They are aggressively working to replace the browser facing applications in the coming weeks but require more time for a small number of systems (3 certificates) that communicate peer-to-peer to propagate the change.  Their operation is heavily impacted by COVID-19 restrictions for onsite personnel who belong to specific risk groups to make this change in the short period of time required.  Revoking the certificate will have material impact on the banking eco-system and the bank’s role to support the various governments in comprehensive package of measures including their ability to service loans (SBA and other equivalent COVID-19 Bridging Loans) for businesses in the US and Europe and bring hardship to thousands of people in the form of missed payments and inability to make short term loans during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>482 certificates are for various customers that have cited reasons related to delays due to COVID restrictions in getting to data centers to facilitate the replacement.  Roughly a quarter of these are for a customer whose systems monitor COVID patients who are quarantined at home (subject of serial numbers is 0147512CD4014943BE99B99138A88AF0).</p>
<p>We have another customer that is requiring about 45 days to complete the replacement and revocation given they are handling POS terminals that cannot be cycled out in rapid fashion given their operational risk and impact for supporting customers during COVID.</p>
<p>We hope that the examples provided demonstrate by these Subscribers’ cases, why the situation is exceptional, and merit our consideration for providing them more than the 5 days.</p>
<p>We recognize that browsers do not grant exceptions, and this is entirely up to the CA based on a risk analysis given exceptional circumstances.  These circumstances are what we want to highlight in our response and notice of delay.  Given the once-in-a century situation we have with this pandemic, more people are transacting business on-line (whether it is healthcare or financial-related).  The restrictions and lock-down that have been imposed and continues to severely impact the maintenance windows for changes for many of our customers.</p>
<p>We also recognize that under Mozilla policy that exceptional circumstances may be weighed in the balance of revoking certificates.  We’ve established in the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1650910" title="ASSIGNED - DigiCert: Inconsistent EV audits">bug 1650910</a> Incident Report that the issue of the inconsistent EV audits that was raised was unprecedented.  We sought to remedy the situation by following through on revoking the EV certificates issued under those impacted ICAs.  However, given the novel situation with the EV audit gap with the ICA listings in our audits, but covered under the WebTrust for CA and BR audits, that we have to balance the true risk of the underlying issue with the significant harm caused by the revocation of a subset of the certificates and risk to people carrying out the tasks to travel to sites who are in lock down situations.</p>
<p>For clarity, we are not planning to retroactively consider an EV audit to resolve.  We are revoking the certificates, but we are posting this delay notice given the circumstances that will cause significant harm to critical infrastructure that cannot be replaced safely by the 5 day deadline.  We agree with you that adding to OneCRL is not the best path forward, which is why we are pursuing the revocation of the EV certificates as the course of action.</p>
<p>We have made good progress on automation over the last year and are continuing to build on it. We have ACME and other automation solutions and are working on simplifying the process of installation of the clients. One area we are focusing on is figuring out how to get enterprises to use the tools built in providing certificates.  We welcome any suggestions about how customers can be encouraged to adopt automation faster.</p>

<p>I want to focus on this a little. Had DigiCert implemented the solutions it'd previously committed to, then it seems reasonable that the once-in-a-century nature of the global pandemic would be irrelevant, for the same reason that, say, Covid-19 hasn't brought down global DNS. If we look at systemic root causes, we see that there isn't really novelty or previously unknown situations here; the situations provided in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1651828#c2" title="ASSIGNED - DigiCert: Delay of revocation for EV audit inconsistency incident">Comment #2</a> are explanations that DigiCert and other CAs have provided in the past, and even CAs like Symantec have used.</p>
<p>My concern is that these incident reports are an opportunity to learn and improve, and I worry that, so far, this issue doesn't provide any substantively new details that we can learn from, nor does it even propose any actionable or concrete improvements. At best, they're described in the abstract, and at worst, it can be read as "We plan to keep doing the same as we've been doing", which implicitly means "we plan to keep having these incidents until it's no longer commercially viable"</p>
<p>I appreciate the added detail that helps share why you believe the risk in revocation is significant. What I don't see is anything concrete in how to reduce that risk going forward, nor any discussion about why that risk wasn't already mitigated, as had previously been committed to. The purpose of past incident reports with DigiCert has been to systemically drive down this risk, but with incidents such as this, it's objectively hard to determine whether anything has been or can be learned.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when incident reports no longer provide new information or new understanding, they begin to appear as if the CA is saying "There's nothing more we can do to meet expectations", and that's when questions about trust necessarily have to come in. As much as possible, I'd like to avoid that.</p>
<p>I think a good example would be if, say, a DigiCert customer were to obtain a certificate, and then install it at a nuclear reactor as the basis for some management tool, or, say, install it on some medical screening device. If they do that, they're being unconscionably negligent and reckless, putting their users at risk, presumably on the basis of some convenience to them. The same as if I were to go install a bunch of nails in the tires of my car because they sparkle more and I like sparkles. That doesn't mean it's the tire manufacturer's fault for not supporting sparkly nails, and it's certainly no basis to go yell and blame the tire manufacturer for not giving me replacements/not selling me nail-proof tires because, like an idiot, I stuck some nails in my tire and didn't think about the consequences.</p>
<p>In such an incident report, it'd be reasonable to ask if DigiCert was telling folks to put nails in their tires. If they weren't doing that, did DigiCert at least let their customers know that putting nails in their tires is a bad idea? Did they offer sparkly tires, and the customer decide not to get them, because they thought tires with nails would look better? If, as a good faith gesture, the manufacturer offers to replace those tires, and then they go stick a bunch of nails in the new ones and demand replacements again, isn't it reasonable to tell them "wat"?</p>
<p>The analogy is tortured, admittedly, and I think we can stick a nail in it, because it's done. But I think there's a reasonably large concern that, to date, the details on this largely amount to "it's hard", and the plan forward is a bit "lol idk". I can understand that there's a partnership here, but I don't think the solution should have to come up with the browsers. You made a promise to the community you would design your systems to do one thing, that any customers you accepted would understand that you would do that one thing, and now when you're asked to do the one thing, it's exceptional and unforeseen.</p>
<p>Now that I've said mostly nice things, I want to be specific: publicly trusted certificates being used on ATMs and payment terminals is gross incompetence and negligence. I have zero sympathy for this, because since 2015, the consistent, loud, resounding message has been "STOP DOING THAT". I have zero sympathy for a CA that says "We didn't know they were doing that, oopsies", because DigiCert knew the expectations here, especially in light of the Symantec acquisition, in which DigiCert knew this would be unacceptable going forward. This goes <em>doubly</em> when at least one of these customers is a repeat offender. It should be simply unacceptable for this to keep happening.</p>
<p>I am beyond frustrated and disappointed by DigiCert's response, particularly <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1651828#c2" title="ASSIGNED - DigiCert: Delay of revocation for EV audit inconsistency incident">Comment #2</a>, because I fail to see how anything has changed from Symantec's responses, which ultimately contributed to them being distrusted. This is the opposite of a desirable pattern, and will eventually have to lead to the same result if it continues. I would be deeply troubled if DigiCert failed to revoke, based on the information presently shared, not because I'm not incredibly sympathetic or understanding to the truly once-in-a-lifetime (hopefully) global pandemic, but because DigiCert has put zero credible plan forward to address either these customers, or their broader customer base, going forward. And that's on DigiCert.</p>
