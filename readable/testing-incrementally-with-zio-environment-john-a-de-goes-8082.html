        <hr/>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
      <p>In my <a href="http://degoes.net/articles/zio-environment">last post</a>, I introduced <em>ZIO Environment</em>, which is a new feature in ZIO that bakes in a high-performance, type-safe, and fully-inferred reader effect into the ZIO data type.</p>

<p>This capability leads to a way of describing and testing effects that I call <em>environmental effects</em>. Unlike tagless-final, which is difficult to teach, difficult to abstract over, and does not infer, environmental effects are simple, abstract well, and infer completely.</p>

<p>Moreover, while proponents of tagless-final argue that tagless-final <em>parametrically constrains</em> effects, my <a href="http://degoes.net/articles/zio-environment">last post</a> demonstrated this is not quite correct: not only can you embed raw effects <em>anywhere</em> in Scala, but even without leaving <em>Scalazzi</em> (the purely functional subset of Scala), you can lift arbitrary effects into any <code>Applicative</code> functor.</p>

<p>The inability of tagless-final to constrain effects is more than just theoretical:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Scala functional programmers use effect type classes like <code>Sync</code> everywhere (which are themselves lawless and serve only to embed effects), and they embed effects using lazy methods, like <code>defer</code> or <code>point</code>.</li>
  <li>Even some experienced Scala functional programmers embed effects in pure methods (for example, exceptions in the functions they pass to <code>map</code>, <code>flatMap</code>), and some effect types encourage this behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tagless-final can be used by a well-trained and highly-disciplined team to constrain effects, but the same can be said for many approaches, <em>including</em> environmental effects.</p>

<p>After professionally and pedagogically wrestling with these issues for several years now, Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion there are just two legitimately compelling reasons to use tagless-final:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Avoiding commitment to a specific effect type, which can be useful for library authors, but which is less useful for application developers (often itâ€™s a hinderance!);</li>
  <li>Writing testable functional code, which is fairly straightforward with tagless-final because you can just create test instances for different effect type classes.</li>
</ol>

<p>While testability is a compelling reason to <em>use</em> tagless-final, itâ€™s not necessarily a compelling reason to <em>choose</em> tagless-final over other approachesâ€”in particular, over environmental effects.</p>

<p>In this post, Iâ€™m going to show you how to use environmental effects to achieve testability. I hope to demonstrate that environmental effects provide easier and more incremental testabilityâ€”all without sacrificing teachability, abstraction, or type inference.</p>

<h2 id="a-web-app">A Web App</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s say we are building a web application with ZIO. Suppose the application was originally written with <code>Future</code> or perhaps some version of <code>IO</code> or <code>Task</code>.</p>

<p>Later, the application was ported to ZIOâ€™s <code>Task[A]</code>, which is a type alias for <code>ZIO[Any, Throwable, A]</code>â€”representing an effect that requires no specific environment and that may fail with any <code>Throwable</code>.</p>

<p>Now letâ€™s say one of the functions in our application, called <code>inviteFriends</code>, invites the friends of a given user to the application by sending them emails:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> <span>inviteFriends</span><span>(</span><span>userID</span><span>:</span> <span>UserID</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Task</span><span>[</span><span>List</span><span>[</span><span>Send</span><span>]]</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>user</span>    <span>&lt;-</span> <span>DB</span><span>.</span><span>lookupUser</span><span>(</span><span>userID</span><span>)</span>
    <span>friends</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Social</span><span>.</span><span>getFriends</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>facebookID</span><span>)</span>
    <span>resp</span>    <span>&lt;-</span> <span>ZIO</span><span>.</span><span>foreach</span><span>(</span><span>friends</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>friend</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
                 <span>Email</span><span>.</span><span>invite</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>friend</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>)</span>
               <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>yield</span> <span>resp</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Portions of the <code>Social</code>, <code>DB</code>, and <code>Email</code> objects are shown below:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>object</span> <span>Social</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>getFriends</span><span>(</span><span>fid</span><span>:</span> <span>FacebookID</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Task</span><span>[</span><span>List</span><span>[</span><span>FacebookProfile</span><span>]]</span> <span>=</span> <span>???</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>object</span> <span>DB</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>lookupUser</span><span>(</span><span>uid</span><span>:</span> <span>UserID</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Task</span><span>[</span><span>UserProfile</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>???</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>object</span> <span>Email</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>invite</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>UserProfile</span><span>,</span> <span>friend</span><span>:</span> <span>FacebookProfile</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Task</span><span>[</span><span>Send</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>???</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As currently written, our web application is not very testable. The function <code>inviteFriends</code> makes direct calls to database functions, Facebook API functions, and email service functions.</p>

<p>While we may have automated tests for our web service, because our application interacts directly with the real world, the tests are actually <em>system tests</em>, not <em>unit tests</em>. Such tests are very difficult to write, they run slowly, they randomly fail, and they test much more than our application logic.</p>

<p>We do not have time to rewrite our application, and we cannot make it testable all at once. Instead, letâ€™s try to remove dependency on the live database for the <code>inviteFriends</code> function.</p>

<p>If we succeed in doing this, we will make our test code a <em>little better</em>, and after we ship the new code, we can incrementally use the same technique to make the function <em>fully</em> testableâ€”fast, deterministic, and without any external dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="steps-toward-testability">Steps Toward Testability</h3>

<p>To incrementally refactor <code>inviteFriends</code> to be more testable, weâ€™re going to perform the following series of refactorings:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Introduce a type alias.</li>
  <li>Introduce a module for the database.</li>
  <li>Implement a production database module.</li>
  <li>Integrate the production module.</li>
  <li>Implement a test database module.</li>
  <li>Test the <code>inviteFriends</code> function.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these steps will be covered in the sections that follow.</p>

<h3 id="introduce-a-type-alias">Introduce A Type Alias</h3>

<p>To simplify the process of refactoring our application, weâ€™re going to first introduce a simple type alias that we can use in the definition of <code>inviteFriends</code> and the functions that call it:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>type</span> <span>Webapp</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Task</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now we will mechanically update the <code>lookupUser</code> function and any functions that call it to use the type alias:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> <span>inviteFriends</span><span>(</span><span>userID</span><span>:</span> <span>UserID</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Webapp</span><span>[</span><span>List</span><span>[</span><span>Send</span><span>]]</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>user</span>    <span>&lt;-</span> <span>DB</span><span>.</span><span>lookupUser</span><span>(</span><span>userID</span><span>)</span>
    <span>friends</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Social</span><span>.</span><span>getFriends</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>facebookID</span><span>)</span>
    <span>resp</span>    <span>&lt;-</span> <span>ZIO</span><span>.</span><span>foreach</span><span>(</span><span>friends</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>friend</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
                 <span>Email</span><span>.</span><span>invite</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>friend</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>)</span>
               <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>yield</span> <span>resp</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As an alternative to this technique, we could simply delete the return types entirely. However, itâ€™s a good practice to place return types on top-level function signatures, so developers without IDEs can easily determine the return type of functions.</p>

<p>After this step, we are ready to introduce a service for the database.</p>

<h3 id="introduce-a-database-module">Introduce a Database Module</h3>

<p>The database module will provide access to a database service.</p>

<p>As discussed in my post on <a href="http://degoes.net/articles/zio-environment">ZIO Environment</a>, the database module is an ordinary interface with a single field, which contains the database service.</p>

<p>We can define both the module and the service very simply:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>// The database module
</span><span>trait</span> <span>Database</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>val</span> <span>database</span><span>:</span> <span>Database.Service</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>object</span> <span>Database</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// The database service
</span>  <span>trait</span> <span>Service</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>lookupUser</span><span>(</span><span>uid</span><span>:</span> <span>UserID</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Task</span><span>[</span><span>UserProfile</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice how we have decided to place just one method inside the database service: the <code>lookupUser</code> method. Although there may be many database methods, we donâ€™t have time to make all of them testable, so we will focus on the one required by the <code>inviteFriends</code> method.</p>

<p>We are now ready to implement a production version of the service.</p>

<h3 id="implement-production-module">Implement Production Module</h3>

<p>We will call the production database module <code>DatabaseLive</code>. To implement the module, we need only copy and paste the implementation of <code>Database.lookupUser</code> into our implementation of the service interface:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>trait</span> <span>DatabaseLive</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Database</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>val</span> <span>database</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>new</span> <span>Database</span><span>.</span><span>Service</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>// Implementation copy/pasted from
</span>      <span>// DB.lookupUser:
</span>      <span>def</span> <span>lookupUser</span><span>(</span><span>userID</span><span>:</span> <span>UserID</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> 
        <span>...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>object</span> <span>DatabaseLive</span> <span>extends</span> <span>DatabaseLive</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For maximum flexibility and convenience, we have defined both a <em>trait</em> that implements the database module, which can be mixed into other traits, and an <em>object</em> that extends the trait, which can be used standalone.</p>

<h3 id="integrate-production-module">Integrate Production Module</h3>

<p>We now have all the pieces we need to replace the original <code>DB.lookupUser</code> method, whose actual implementation now resides inside our <code>DatabaseLive</code> module:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>object</span> <span>DB</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>lookupUser</span><span>(</span><span>uid</span><span>:</span> <span>UserID</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>ZIO</span><span>[</span><span>Database</span>, <span>Throwable</span>, <span>UserProfile</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>ZIO</span><span>.</span><span>accessM</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span>.</span><span>database</span> <span>lookupUser</span> <span>uid</span><span>)</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>lookupUser</code> method merely delegates to the database module, by accessing the model through ZIO Environment (<code>ZIO.accessM</code>).</p>

<p>Here we donâ€™t use the <code>Webapp</code> type alias, because the functions in <code>DB</code> will not necessarily have the same dependencies as our web application.</p>

<p>However, after enough refactoring, we might introduce a new type alias in the <code>DB</code> object: <code>type DB[A] = ZIO[Database, Throwable, A]</code>. Eventually, all methods in <code>DB</code> might return effects of this type.</p>

<p>At this point, our refactoring is nearly complete. But we have to take care of one last detail: we have to provide our database module to the production application.</p>

<p>There are two main ways to provide the database module to our application. If it is inconvenient to propagate the <code>Webapp</code> type signature to the top of our application, we can always supply the production module somewhere inside our application.</p>

<p>In the worst case, if we are pressed for time and need to ship code today, maybe we choose to provide the production database wherever we call <code>inviteFriends</code>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>inviteFriends</span><span>(</span><span>userId</span><span>).</span><span>provide</span><span>(</span><span>DatabaseLive</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we have a bit more time, we can push the <code>Webapp</code> type synonym to the entry point of our purely functional application, which might be the main function, or it might be where our web framework calls into our code.</p>

<p>In this case, instead of using the <code>DefaultRuntime</code> that ships with ZIO, we can define our own <code>Runtime</code>, which provides the production database module):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>val</span> <span>myRuntime</span> <span>=</span> 
  <span>Runtime</span><span>(</span><span>DatabaseLive</span><span>,</span> <span>PlatformLive</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The custom runtime can be used to run many different effects that all require the same environment, so we donâ€™t have to call <code>provide</code> on all of them before we run them.</p>

<p>Once we have this custom runtime, we can run our top-level effect, which will supply its required environment:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>myRuntime</span><span>.</span><span>unsafeRun</span><span>(</span><span>effect</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>At this point, we have not changed the behavior of our application at allâ€”it will work exactly as it did before. Weâ€™ve just moved the code around a bit, so we can access a tiny effect through ZIO environment.</p>

<p>Now itâ€™s time to build a database module specifically for testing.</p>

<h3 id="implement-test-module">Implement Test Module</h3>

<p>We could implement the test database module using a mocking framework. However, to avoid all magic and use of reflection, in this post, we will build one from scratch.</p>

<p>For maximum flexibility, our test database module will track all calls to <code>lookupUser</code>, and supply responses using a <code>Map</code>, which can be dynamically changed by the test suite.</p>

<p>To support this stateful behavior, we will need a <code>Ref</code>, which is a concurrent-safe ZIO data structure that models mutable references. We will also need a simple (immutable) data structure to hold the state of the test database module.</p>

<p>We define the following test data structure, which is capable of tracking a list of <code>UserID</code> values, and holding data that maps from <code>UserID</code> to <code>UserProfile</code>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>final</span> <span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>TestDatabaseState</span><span>(</span>
  <span>lookups</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>UserID</span><span>],</span>
  <span>data</span>    <span>:</span> <span>Map</span><span>[</span><span>UserID</span>, <span>UserProfile</span><span>]</span>
<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>addLookup</span><span>(</span><span>uid</span><span>:</span> <span>UserID</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>TestDatabaseState</span> <span>=</span> <span>copy</span><span>(</span><span>lookups</span> <span>=</span> <span>uid</span> <span>::</span> <span>lookups</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now we can define the service of our test database module. The service will require a <code>Ref[TestDatabaseState]</code>, so it can not only use test data, but update the test state:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>final</span> <span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>TestDatabaseService</span><span>(</span><span>ref</span><span>:</span> <span>Ref</span><span>[</span><span>TestDatabaseState</span><span>])</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Database</span><span>.</span><span>Service</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>lookupUser</span><span>(</span><span>uid</span><span>:</span> <span>UserID</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Task</span><span>[</span><span>UserProfile</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>for</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>_</span>       <span>&lt;-</span> <span>ref</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span>.</span><span>addLookup</span> <span>uid</span><span>)</span>
      <span>data</span>    <span>&lt;-</span> <span>ref</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
      <span>profile</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Task</span><span>.</span><span>fromEither</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>uid</span><span>)</span>
                   <span>.</span><span>fold</span><span>(</span><span>Left</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>DBErr</span><span>))(</span>
                     <span>Right</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span>)))</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>yield</span> <span>profile</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice how the <code>lookupUser</code> function stores the <code>UserID</code> of every call in the <code>lookups</code> field of the <code>TestDatabaseState</code>. In addition, the function retrieves test responses from the map. If there is no response in the map, the function fails, presumably in the same way the production database would fail.</p>

<p>The test service must be placed in a module. In general, we should wait to create the module until the test suite, because then we will know the full set of dependencies for each test.</p>

<p>However, at this stage, the database service is the only dependency in our application, so we can make a helper function to create the test database module:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>object</span> <span>TestDatabase</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>apply</span><span>(</span><span>ref</span><span>:</span> <span>Ref</span><span>[</span><span>TestDatabaseState</span><span>])</span><span>:</span> <span>Database</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>new</span> <span>Database</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>val</span> <span>database</span><span>:</span> <span>Database.Service</span> <span>=</span> 
        <span>new</span> <span>TestDatabaseService</span><span>(</span><span>ref</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We now have all the pieces necessary to write a test of the <code>inviteFriends</code> function, which will use our test database module.</p>

<h3 id="write-the-test">Write the Test</h3>

<p>To more easily test the <code>lookupFriends</code> function, we will define a helper function. Given test data and input to the function, the helper will return the final test state and the output of the <code>lookupFriends</code> function:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> <span>runLookupFriends</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>Map</span><span>[</span><span>UserID</span>, <span>UserProfile</span><span>],</span> <span>uid</span><span>:</span> <span>UserID</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Task</span><span>[(</span><span>TestDatabaseState</span>, <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>Send</span><span>])]</span> <span>=</span> 
  <span>for</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ref</span>   <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Ref</span><span>.</span><span>make</span><span>(</span><span>TestDatabaseState</span><span>(</span><span>Nil</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>))</span>
    <span>resp</span>  <span>&lt;-</span> <span>lookupFriends</span><span>(</span><span>uid</span><span>)</span>
               <span>.</span><span>provide</span><span>(</span><span>TestDatabase</span><span>(</span><span>ref</span><span>))</span>
    <span>state</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>ref</span><span>.</span><span>get</span> 
  <span>}</span> <span>yield</span> <span>(</span><span>state</span><span>,</span> <span>resp</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The helper function creates a <code>Ref</code> with the initial test data, uses the <code>Ref</code> to create the <code>TestDatabase</code> module, and then supplies the database module to the effect returned by <code>lookupFriends</code>.</p>

<p>With this helper function, writing a test becomes quite simple:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>class</span> <span>TestSuite</span> <span>extends</span> <span>DefaultRuntime</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>testLookupFriends</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>(</span><span>state</span><span>,</span> <span>resp</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> 
      <span>unsafeRun</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>runLookupFriends</span><span>(</span>
          <span>Map</span><span>(</span><span>TestUserID</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>TestUserProfile</span><span>),</span>
          <span>TestUserID</span>
        <span>)</span>
      <span>}</span>
    
    <span>(</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>lookups</span> <span>must_===</span> <span>List</span><span>(</span><span>TestUserID</span><span>))</span> <span>and</span>
      <span>(</span><span>resp</span> <span>must_===</span> <span>TestResponse</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This test for <code>inviteFriends</code> is not perfect. It still interacts with a real Facebook API and a real email service. But compared to whatever tests already exist, at least this test does not interact with a real database.</p>

<p>Moreover, we were able to make this change in a <em>minimally disruptive</em> manner.</p>

<h3 id="a-glimpse-beyond">A Glimpse Beyond</h3>

<p>After a little more refactoring, of course, we would succeed in making <code>inviteFriends</code> fully testable. Even after the full refactoring, the code for <code>lookupFriends</code> would not change.</p>

<p>Instead, our type alias for <code>Webapp</code> would expand to include new environmental effects:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>type</span> <span>WebappFX</span> <span>=</span> 
  <span>Database</span> <span>with</span> <span>Social</span> <span>with</span> <span>Email</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Webapp</span><span>[</span><span>A</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>ZIO</span><span>[</span><span>WebappFX</span>, <span>Throwable</span>, <span>A</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now all the methods in the <code>DB</code>, <code>Social</code>, and <code>Email</code> objects would simply delegate to their respective modules using <code>ZIO.accessM</code>.</p>

<p>Running our application would now look a little different:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>val</span> <span>myRuntime</span> <span>=</span> 
  <span>Runtime</span><span>(</span>

<p>Finally, testing <code>lookupFriends</code> would be entirely fast, deterministic, and type-safe, without any dependencies on external systems, or use of any reflection.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Environmental effects make it easy to test purely functional applicationsâ€”significantly easier and with less ceremony than tagless-final, with full type inference, and without false promises.</p>

<p>Morever, with environmental effects, we can make even just a <em>single function</em> testable, by pushing that function into an environmental effect. This requires just a few small changes that can be done incrementally without major disruption to the application.</p>

<p>This ability lets us make incremental progress towards better application architecture. We donâ€™t have to solve all the problems in our code base at once. We can focus on making our application a little better each day.</p>

<p>While this post focused on ZIO Environment, if youâ€™re using <code>Future</code>, Monix, or Cats IO, you can still use this approach with a <code>ReaderT</code> monad transformer. With a monad transformer, you will lose type inference and some performance, but you will gain the other benefits in a more familiar package.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to give ZIO Environment a try, hop over to the <a href="https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-zio">Github project page</a>, and be sure to stop by the <a href="https://gitter.im/scalaz/scalaz-zio">Gitter channel</a> and say hello.</p>

<p>In future posts, I will cover how to provide partial dependencies, how to model services that require other services (the <em>graph problem</em>), how to hide implementation details, and how this approach differs from the classic cake pattern. Stay tuned for more!</p>
