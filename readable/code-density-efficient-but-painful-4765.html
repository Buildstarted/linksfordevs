<p>Taking this analogy back to programming with abstractions, consider two ways to add one to every element in a list.  One uses the <code>map</code> abstraction and the other manually iterates with a for loop.</p>

<pre>new_list = map(lambda v: v + 1, my_list)</pre>

<p>vs.</p>

<pre>new_list = []
for v in my_list:
    new_list.append(v + 1)
</pre>
<p><code>map</code>, once you understand it, immediately conveys more information than the for loop.  When you see <code>map</code> being used, you know a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>the output list has the same length as the input list</li>
<li>the input list is not modified</li>
<li>each output element only depends on the corresponding input element</li>
</ol>
<p>To build this same level of understanding given a for loop, you have to read the loop body.  In trivial examples like this one, it's easy, but most loop bodies aren't so simple.</p>
<p><code>map</code> is common enough in programming languages that most people have no problem with it.  But there are abstractions everywhere: monads, semigroups, actors, currying, coroutines, threads, sockets, closures...  Each abstraction conveys some useful meaning to the programmer, often by applying some rules or restrictions.</p>
<p>Consider asynchronous programming with callback soup versus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine">coroutines</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">tasks</a>, or <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Concurrency">lightweight</a> <a href="https://gobyexample.com/goroutines">threads</a>.  When you are programming with callbacks it's very easy to forget to call a callback or call it twice.  This can result in some extremely hard-to-diagnose bugs.  Coroutines / tasks provide a useful guarantee: asynchronous operations will return exactly once.  This abstraction comes with a cost, however: the code is more terse and indirect, and depends on your knowledge of the abstraction, just like <code>map</code> above.</p>
<p>So right.  Abstractions exist.  They must be learned, but they provide some nice guarantees.</p>
<p>Applied in the extreme, abstractions result in extremely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100204095704/http://www.serpentine.com/blog/2009/12/01/dense-dense-you-say/">dense, terse code</a>.  In languages with weak support for cheap-abstraction-building, like Go, this code would have to be spelled out <a href="http://trelford.com/blog/post/C2b2b-vs-C-vs-F-vs-Haskell.aspx">manually</a>.  One might look at that Haskell and exclaim "Agh, that's unreadable."  But, ignoring language familiarity, consider the amount of knowledge gained per unit of mental effort and time.  The algorithm has a certain amount of inherent complexity.  You can either read a whole lot of "simple" lines of code or a few "hard" lines of code, but you'll build the same amount of understanding in the end.</p>
<p>My conjecture: People don't like reading dense code, so it feels less productive than reading a lot of fluffy code, even if it's actually faster.  This is the same psychological effect as the MacOS mouse vs. keyboard shortcut feedback.  I'm not aware of any comprehension speed studies across, say, Haskell and Java, but I wouldn't be surprised if people feel slower when reading Haskell but are actually faster.</p>
<p>Perhaps, to maximize productivity, you want to optimize for unpleasantness - the day will be "longer" so you can get more done.</p>
<p>Why might density be unpleasant?  I'm not at all sure why papers full of equations are so intimidating compared to prose, but I have a guess.  When most people read, their eyes and attention subconsciously jump around a bit.  When reading less dense material, this is fine -- perhaps even beneficial.  But with very dense material, each symbol or word conveys a lot of meaning, forcing the reader's eyes and attention to move much more slowly and deliberately so the brain can stay caught up.  This forced slowness hurts and feels wrong, even if it actually results in quicker comprehension.  Again, totally a guess.  I have no idea.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be worth bumping up the font size when reading math or dense Haskell code?</p>

<h2>An Aside</h2>
<p>My blog posts are frequently misinterpreted as if I'm making broader statements than I am, so here are some things I'm <strong>NOT</strong> saying:</p>
<p>I'm definitely not saying code that's terse for the sake of it is always a win.  For example, consider the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.1.0/docs/Data-Maybe.html#v:maybe">maybe</a> function: some people <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3cvnza/sum_types_are_coming_what_you_should_know/cszjfhy">love it</a> but is it really any clearer than just pattern matching as necessary?</p>
<p>Also, I am not saying Haskell is always faster to read than anything else.  I'm talking about code density in general, including abstraction-heavy or functional-style Python, or a super-tight C algorithm versus fluffy OOP object soup.</p>
