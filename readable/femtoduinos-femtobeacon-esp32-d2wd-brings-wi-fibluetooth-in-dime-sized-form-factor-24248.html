<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p><span>When Espressif Systems introduced their ESP8266 SoC in 2014, it was the smallest chip that could be had that provided fully-fledged Wi-Fi to boards with limited communications capabilities. Shortly afterward, the ESP32 ‚Äî an even smaller microcontroller ‚Äî came along and brought with it Bluetooth capabilities, including BR/EDR and BLE options. While those chips can come in any number of packages for development purposes, none are smaller than Femtoduino‚Äôs </span><a href="https://femtoduino.com/" rel="nofollow">FemtoBeacon</a><span> ‚Äî a dime-sized (9mm radius/18mm diameter) board based on the ESP32 chipset.</span></p><div><div><p><span>The FemtoBeacon is a coin-sized ESP32-based board with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. (üì∑: Femtoduino)</span></p></div></div><p>According to Femtoduino, the company designed the board ‚Äúto provide the world‚Äôs smallest open source coin boards with a variety of features. This product is meant to provide Wi-Fi/Bluetooth features to projects that are constrained by size limits. It‚Äôs so small! There‚Äôs nothing like it anywhere. If you need a small Wi-Fi design, this is your coin!‚Äù</p><p>The FemtoBeacon is outfitted with the ESP32-D2WD chipset, consisting of a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 dual-core processor, 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth v4.2 BR/EDR and BLE. An onboard LDO regulator accepts up to 5.5V, and supplies 3.3V to the coin. It also features SPI, UART, JTAG pinouts, and 1.27mm stand-offs can be soldered on if needed (for an additional fee).</p><div><div><p><span>The FemtoBeacon schematic shows the board‚Äôs SPI/JTAG pinout placements, which can be used with stand-offs for easy access when used with development boards. (üì∑: Femtoduino)</span></p></div></div><p><span>Programming the FemtoBeacon can be done through the </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/arduino/products/arduino-ide" rel="nofollow">Arduino IDE</a><span>, and it should be noted at this point that you will need a USB to UART adapter with 3.3V supply, as the chip is not 5V tolerable. Femtoduino is currently selling the FemtoBeacon </span><a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/femtoduino/femtobeacon-esp32-d2wd-wifibluetooth-coin/#product-description" rel="nofollow">on Tindie</a><span> for $30 but is currently out of stock at this point. The board is open source as well, so those looking to build their own can head over to </span><a href="https://github.com/femtoduino/femto-beacon" rel="nofollow">Femtoduino‚Äôs GitHub page</a><span> for all schematics, files, and software needed to do so.</span></p><figure></figure></div></section></div></div>
