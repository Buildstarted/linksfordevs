<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div _ngcontent-mld-c11=""><p> Dear Founders, </p><p> As you know, since last Friday July 31, we’ve been managing an extremely difficult situation which has brought us all a lot of uncertainty, caused by the hacking of a substantial part of all the cryptocurrencies available in the 2gether user accounts. </p><p> From the moment we became aware of the attack, we’ve been fighting nonstop on different fronts. First, we worked on stopping the hit, limiting the theft to ~€1.183M (which amounted to 26.79% of the positions in the user accounts in Kraken) and preserving the integrity of the euro accounts, the BTC &amp; ETH wallets, and the 2GT accounts. In the two days following the attack, we’ve been working on finding the funds needed to cover all positions. More specifically, and until a few minutes ago, we’ve been working with an investment group with which we sadly haven’t been able to reach an agreement. </p><p> As this was going on, we’ve been trying to share with you the most recent updates with total transparency, but still avoiding giving you fake expectations, as we didn’t have enough funds to cover said positions. </p><p> At this point, we want to offer you the solution that offers the best guarantees for your funds: we want to compensate the amount of stolen cryptocurrency (26.79% of your position before the attack) with a volume in 2GT equivalent to the issuance price of 5 cents. On top of that, we commit to keep looking, at top capacity and as soon as possible, for additional funds to make up for every single one of your cryptocurrencies. That way you’ll be able to get back the totality of your positions, and the equivalent value in 2GT tokens at issuance price. </p><p> We can assure you, with a great deal of chagrin, that if we could face this theft with our own funds, we would. In fact, we’ve been working nonstop for the last 48 hours to achieve it. It hasn’t been possible and we don’t want to delay a reply any longer. </p><p> 2gether keeps being a great project that some soulless individuals have tried to thwart, but we’re confident that with your understanding and your help, we’ll move on. </p><p> Since last Friday, and while we were looking for a solution for your funds, the technical team has been working on re-establishing the app’s service with all the guarantees that there are no weaknesses, so that you can access your funds and operate freely. It’s not an easy job and, on top of that, we’re working with an external team of experts. The app will be back up as soon as possible and with all the security measures available. </p><p> In the next few days we’ll organize an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session to clarify all your questions. We hope you can see these hard times and adverse events compensated soon, whether you decide to give us the vote of confidence we’re asking you for or not. </p><p> Salvador Casquero (Chairman), Ramón Ferraz (CEO) y Luis Estrada (Director) </p></div></div></div>
