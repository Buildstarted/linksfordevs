			<p>We wanted to get this post up earlier, but today? <em>Server issues.</em> Thankfully, those are resolved and <strong>Good Black News</strong>&nbsp;is happy to grab a moment during <strong>African American Music Appreciation Month</strong> to honor what would have been the 62nd birthday of the one and only <strong>Prince</strong>.</p>
<p>His music is legendary, no question, and we could offer a playlist full of his genius output that could keep your ears busy into the end of next week.</p>
<p>But in light of current events – the literal revolution unfolding before us born in Prince’s hometown of Minneapolis – today we offer an appreciation and compilation of Prince’s protest music.</p>
<p>Ever since he started recording, Prince has composed songs addressing war, racism, gender issues, inequality, usury and police brutality.</p>
<p>From well-known singles such as <strong>“Controversy,” “1999,” “Pop Life,”</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>“Sign O’ The Times”</strong> to lesser-known album cuts like <strong>“PartyUp,” “Colonized Mind,” “Avalanche,”</strong>&nbsp;<strong>“We March”</strong> and<strong> “Baltimore,”</strong>&nbsp;his 2015 tribute to <strong><a href="https://goodblacknews.org/2015/09/08/freddie-grays-family-to-receive-6-4-million-settlement-from-baltimore/">Freddie Gray</a></strong>, Prince constantly used his unparalleled talent and voice to highlight injustice.</p>
<p>To read more about several of his protest songs, click <a href="https://shadowproof.com/2016/04/25/the-protest-songs-of-prince/">here</a>. To listen, click below. Power to the New Generation!</p>

			<p><em>by Jeff Meier (FB: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jeff.meier.90">Jeff.Meier.90</a>)</em></p>
<p>This month, as part of<a href="https://goodblacknews.org/2020/06/01/gbn-celebrates-african-american-music-appreciation-month-2020-listen/"><strong> African American Music Appreciation Month</strong></a>, <strong>Good Black News</strong>&nbsp;will offer a set of playlists rediscovering some pioneering musical talents who should no longer be allowed to slip through the cracks of history.</p>
<p>For R&amp;B music fans, it can be a true thrill to discover (or rediscover) an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000008YR/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=goodblacknews-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0000008YR&amp;linkId=7d63bc733a85870fa76f6f1c952fe758">artist whose music has been sitting under our noses the entire time</a> – the familiar production sounds of an era we love, but with songs we’ve never heard before – or barely remember.</p>
<p>It is in that spirit that today’s playlist honors the late <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/23/828906019/ronnie-dyson-a-transitional-soul-figure-lost-to-time"><strong>Ronnie Dyson</strong></a>, who would have turned 70 this past week.</p>
<p>“When the moon is in the Seventh House, and Jupiter aligns with Mars…” – in 1968 at the age of just 18 years old, Ronnie Dyson sang the words that captured a generation when, as an original cast member of the the Broadway musical <strong>“Hair,”</strong> he was picked to solo on <strong>“Aquarius,”</strong> the hippie anthem that opens and sets the tone for the whole show.</p>
<p>Following his introduction to the world in “Hair” (which also featured such original Broadway cast members as <strong>Melba Moore, Diane Keaton</strong> and ‘Last Dance’ disco songwriter<strong> Paul Jabara</strong>), Dyson was immediately propelled onto a career trajectory designed to turn him into a soul star.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0774Z8HNS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0774Z8HNS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=goodblacknews-20&amp;linkId=458b11153023d2b49079cb83c136fe72" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=B0774Z8HNS&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=goodblacknews-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=goodblacknews-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0774Z8HNS" alt="" width="1" height="1">Dyson signed to <strong>Columbia Records</strong> in the <strong>Clive Davis</strong> era and started putting out records – and by 1970, he had his first modest R&amp;B hit, “<strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0774Z8HNS/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=goodblacknews-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0774Z8HNS&amp;linkId=98c63a7349b44431e5f2769d38495172">Why Can’t I Touch You?</a>,”&nbsp;</strong>from an off-Broadway show called <strong>“Salvation.”</strong></p>
<p>Over the next dozen or so years, though, while he managed to hit the R&amp;B Top 40 eight times, Dyson never really struck chart gold. Most writers discussing Dyson talk about him as an artist coming of age potentially in the wrong era.</p>
<p>With a boyish face and lanky frame – and a gospel-infused, higher register tenor voice that sometimes made you wonder whether a man or a woman was singing, perhaps Dyson (and his penchant for standards and big ballads) was out of place during a time of sexy, more traditionally masculine vocalists like <strong>Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes, Barry White</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Teddy Pendergrass</strong>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in trying to find that elusive smash, Columbia teamed Dyson up with some very skilled producers, including<strong> Thom Bell &amp; Linda Creed</strong> (<strong>The Stylistics, The Spinners</strong> and more) and later, <strong>Chuck Jackson &amp; Marvin Yancy</strong> (who had launched <strong>Natalie Cole</strong>‘s career). &nbsp;And in the process, they created some unsung classics.</p>
<p>Today, the Bell &amp; Creed produced <strong>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00968THW4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00968THW4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=goodblacknews-20&amp;linkId=717096279e40e0178f96fc0b95affb37">One Man Band</a>“</strong> album feels like a true lost Philly Soul masterpiece. It generated Dyson’s dramatic original version of <strong>“Just Don’t Want to Be Lonely,”</strong> later a hit for <strong>The Main Ingredient</strong>, as well as the beautiful ballad <strong>“Give In To Love,”</strong> later covered by such artists as <strong>Dee Dee Bridgewater</strong> and <strong>Sister Sledge</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00968THW4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00968THW4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=goodblacknews-20&amp;linkId=1b243f02bd3216a1bbf2f032c7fb9ce8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=B00968THW4&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=goodblacknews-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=goodblacknews-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00968THW4" alt="" width="1" height="1">Listening to the two albums Jackson &amp; Yancy produced for Dyson, you’ll note similarities between songs like <strong>“Close to You”</strong> and the hits that Natalie Cole had that same year. (Late in her career, Natalie actually covered a Dyson tune from this era, ‘The More You Do It.’)</p>
<p>Across all his records, Dyson proves to have almost <strong>Luther Vandross</strong>-like interpretive skills in covering great songs of the era, from stunning versions of <strong>“A Song For You,” “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” “Love Won’t Let Me Wait,”</strong> and<strong> Beatles</strong> standard <strong>“Something”</strong> – to more esoteric covers of <strong>Laura Nyro</strong>‘s <strong>“Emmie,” “Jesus Is Just Alright”</strong> (the Doobie Brothers song), and a soulful take on <strong>Hall &amp; Oates</strong> <strong>“Sara Smile.”</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, after waning career fortunes, Dyson’s last major label release arrived in 1983 (though, ironically, this underperforming <strong>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KQGWIAS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00KQGWIAS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=goodblacknews-20&amp;linkId=25a17efd8e550cd45f992b6f83cbea15">Brand New Day</a>“</strong> LP did manage to yield a prominent club hit, “<strong>All Over Your Face,”</strong>&nbsp;that is by far Dyson’s most streamed <strong>Spotify</strong> song today). Unfortunately, reported drug issues sent Dyson’s health on a downward spiral – he passed away of heart failure in 1990 at the age of 40.</p>
<p>In 1986, several years before he passed away, then rising young filmmaker <strong>Spike Lee</strong> recognized Dyson’s stellar talents, hiring him to sing the vocal version of the composition <strong>“Nola”</strong> for Lee’s debut movie ‘She’s Gotta Have It’. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this song is unavailable on Spotify (seek it out on <a href="http://youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://youtube.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591546102592000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfBL730mjYhxA2B9lXdFJsl8GASQ">youtube.com</a>).</p>
<p>But fortunately, most of Dyson’s other recorded work <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000008YR/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=goodblacknews-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0000008YR&amp;linkId=7d63bc733a85870fa76f6f1c952fe758">is available for you to rediscover</a> now during the 70th anniversary of his birth. We’ve populated this playlist with all his hits, plus many other highlights that will have you reliving that nostalgic mid-70s sound, by way of a spectacular and unique voice that shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>
<p>You are not likely to find these songs on your local oldies radio station. &nbsp;But they should be. &nbsp;Enjoy!</p>

			<p>In 1971, <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/210696"><strong>Wadsworth A. Jarrell</strong></a> painted <strong>“Revolutionary (Angela Davis),”</strong>&nbsp;tapping into his own power and skills as an artist to amplify the message and mission of the <strong>Black Power </strong>and <strong>Civil Rights&nbsp;</strong>movements by dynamically depicting political activist and leader<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis"> Angela Davis</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Also in 1971, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Scott-Heron"><strong>Gil Scott-Heron</strong></a> famously recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnJFhuOWgXg">“The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,”</a>&nbsp;using his power and skills as a musician to passionately address, fortify and amplify the very same movements.</p>
<p>The last line in the song presciently lays out a deeper truth – “The Revolution Will Be Live” – because for any moment to turn into a lasting movement that culminates in systemic change, we all have to “be live.” To harness, hone and offer on our own unique power and skills to the greater mission.</p>

<p>Today, Dena (pictured above with Jarell’s painting) offers a five-minute “Power Shot” to help focus on tapping into and staying connected to our own inner power and skills and using them to guide our actions as we navigate the political and societal sea change ahead of us.&nbsp;Watch:</p>

			<p>According to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29272682/jordan-brand-pledges-100-million-racial-equality-education-initiatives">ESPN.com</a>, <strong>Michael Jordan</strong> and <strong>Jordan Brand</strong> are pledging $100 million over the next 10 years to nationwide organizations “dedicated to ensuring racial equality, social justice and greater access to education.”</p>
<p>To quote from <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29272682/jordan-brand-pledges-100-million-racial-equality-education-initiatives">ESPN</a>:</p>
<p>“Black lives matter. This isn’t a controversial statement,” read a joint statement from Jordan and his company, which is a subsidiary of <strong>Nike</strong>. “Until the ingrained racism that allows our country’s institutions to fail is completely eradicated, we will remain committed to protecting and improving the lives of Black people.”</p>
<p>Specifically, Jordan Brand will increase its work in communities across the United States to provide access to education and opportunities for future generations, while also taking a more active role in supporting organizations that work to effect policy change in local government.</p>
<p>The Jordan Brand pledge came hours after Nike announced its own “Commitment to the Black Community,” an additional $40 million collective pledge to community organizations from the Nike, Jordan and Converse brands over the next four years.</p>

			<p>According to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dc-mayor-unveils-black-lives-matter-painted-streets/story?id=71088808">abcnews.go.com</a>, a major street in Washington D.C that leads to the White House, has been painted with bold, bright-yellow letters reading <strong>“BLACK LIVES MATTER.” </strong>at the behest of&nbsp;<strong>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.</strong></p>
<p>The giant letters are painted just two blocks from Lafayette Square, where on Monday <strong>U.S. Park Police</strong> and other law enforcement agencies used what protesters described as tear gas to make way for the president’s walk to <strong>St. John’s Episcopal Church&nbsp;</strong>where he took a photo holding a Bible.</p>
<p>“There are people who are craving to be heard and to be seen, and to have their humanity recognized, and we had the opportunity to send that message loud and clear on a very important street in our city,” Bowser said at a press conference. “And it is that message, and that message is to the American people, that Black Lives Matter black humanity matters, and we as a city raise that up as part of our values as a city,”</p>
<p>The mayor said that the people who painted it were from the D.C. Public Works department.</p>
<p>D.C. Mayor <strong>Muriel Bowser</strong> also has ordered the stretch of 16th Street NW between H and K streets renamed<strong> “Black Lives Matter PLZ,</strong>” she told reporters at a press conference today.</p>

<p>Music Supervisor <strong>Rob Lowry</strong> (Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/robertlowry">@robertlowry</a>) was recently inspired by <strong>Han Martin</strong>‘s (Twitter:&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/hnicolemartin">@hnicolemartin</a>) <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SKjc7S8MBsp6HoqwaGmDU-HoWFwK7l9cwmuSOF9moE8/edit">“Resources for White Family</a>” post to create his own version of a letter and resources to White friends and family and tweet it to anyone who wanted them.</p>
<p><strong>Good Black News</strong> requested and was given permission by Lowry to share his document in its entirety, as especially now Black people are being asked for resources from White colleagues, friends and family, and already have <strong><em>way too much</em></strong> to handle. So why not just shortcut it for everybody?</p>
<p>Lowry’s intro, letter and resources below:</p>
<p><b>** To everyone reading this: Thank you for taking the time and making the effort to begin having necessary conversations. Please note that this is by no means exhaustive, nor is it “One Size Fits All,” and should be used as a template to revise and repurpose as you see fit. </b></p>
<p><b>This particular version is in many ways meant as a very simple spoon-fed entry way into this conversation. This was compiled from several templates and resources across the web. </b></p>
<p><b>You’ll see that I’ve started my resources with documentaries and movies as that is the easiest and most efficient media that someone is most likely to consume, especially if they can simply click Netflix and the documentary is waiting for them to stream. Please feel free to share, and I hope this proves to be a useful resource for you and your family and friends. **</b></p>
<p><span>Hello Family &amp; Friends,</span></p>
<p><span>First and foremost, I hope everyone is healthy and safe. As our country goes through this difficult period, I have taken much time to reflect on my own privilege, racism (conscious or unconscious), and my education and evolution on those issues over the years. The last few days and weeks have understandably intensified those thoughts. This reflection has led me to reach out to my loved ones to engage and discuss how we can be better allies to Black and Brown people (especially those in the LGTBQ+ community) moving forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These conversations can be difficult. My hope is that by sending this message and opening up a dialogue among close family members, we can listen and learn together and figure out how each of us can play a role in supporting these communities who need our support now more than ever.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These unprecedented times are amplified in communities who directly suffer from racism, police brutality, and oppression on a day to day basis. We know the system is broken and the recent murders of </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/us/george-floyd-trnd/index.html"><span>George Floyd </span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/05/breonna-taylor-is-one-of-a-shocking-number-of-black-people-to-see-armed-police-barge-into-their-homes/"><span>Breonna Taylor</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/25/the-killing-of-ahmaud-arbery"><span>Ahmaud Arbery</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.leftvoice.org/police-mock-sean-reeds-body-after-killing-him-on-facebook-live"><span>Sean Reed</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/05/tony-mcdade-tallahassee-florida-police-shooting-death/"><span>Tony McDade</span></a><span> are a direct result of the system that inherently promotes white supremacy. Below is a graphic to further illustrate how white supremacy expresses itself in our world and how, whether or not we are aware, we contribute to it:</span></p>
<p><span>As we all know, these murders are not an isolated incident but, rather, the results that come from a flawed system designed and built to oppress minorities. While protests rage on across the country, it is an opportunity for people with privilege (like our family) to listen, read, and educate ourselves so that we can play a role in promoting anti-racism. It is easy during times like this to look away and wait for things to settle back down and revert to how they were. But we can no longer do that. We have a responsibility to educate ourselves and be proactive in defending and supporting our fellow human beings. We have the ability to take action, invest in anti-racism, support minority communities, condemn racism and oppression and create a better country – for everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is not the burden of these communities to educate us; we must educate ourselves. We are lucky enough to live in a time where we have access to a wealth of information that we can use at the click of a button. Below is a list of documentaries, books, and other items readily accessible that we could spend a few hours reading or listening to and thinking about. My hope is that this can lead to a further discussion, as a family, of what we can do to be more supportive of these communities.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Chauvin’s charges have also been increased from third to second-degree murder.</p>

<p>The three former officers, <strong>Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng</strong> and <strong>Tou Thao</strong>, were charged with aiding and abetting murder, court records show.</p>
<p>The fourth officer, Chauvin, 44, who was <a title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/minneapolis-police-george-floyd.html">arrested last week</a>, faces an increased charge of second-degree murder.</p>
<p>All four officers were quickly fired from the Minneapolis Police Department after video of the encounter emerged. Officers arrested Mr. Floyd on the evening of May 25 after a store employee called the police, saying that someone had used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://thegrio.com/2020/06/01/floyd-mayweather-george-floyd-funeral/">The Grio</a>, boxing champion&nbsp;<strong>Floyd Mayweather</strong>&nbsp;offered last week to cover all funeral expenses for <strong>George Floyd</strong>. His generous offer has been accepted.</p>
<p>To quote from <a href="https://blackamericaweb.com/2020/06/02/floyd-mayweather-will-pay-for-george-floyds-funeral/">blackamericaweb.com</a>:</p>
<p>According to <strong>Leonard Ellerbe</strong>, the CEO of <strong>Mayweather Promotions</strong>, the Floyd family has accepted his offer. “He’ll probably get mad at me for saying that, but yes, [Mayweather] is definitely paying for the funeral,” he told ESPN on Monday, June 1. “Floyd has done these kind of things over the last 20 years,” he added.</p>
<p>The gesture came about through an unexpected six degrees of separation. <strong>Anzel Jennings</strong>, CEO of The Money Team Record Label, apparently grew up with George Floyd in Houston, Texas.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Lee</strong> of&nbsp;<em>Hollywood Unlocked&nbsp;</em>spoke to Jennings and reports that Anzel reached out to the family on behalf of the boxer.</p>
<p>He will reportedly pay for three ceremonies, one in Houston, Minnesota and Charlotte, North Carolina. A fourth is tentatively planned and Mayweather has agreed to bear the costs for that funeral as well.</p>

<p>Even as our nation is in the grips of a necessary battle against injustice and institutionalized racism, we will not temper the celebration of our culture and our contributions to it.</p>
<p>June is<strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Music_Appreciation_Month">African-American Music Appreciation Month</a></strong>&nbsp;and typically there are scores of live concerts and performances to honor the beauty, art, respite, truth, wisdom, information, strength, joy and freedom in the&nbsp;music Black people have created in this country – no matter the circumstances – and still create to this day.</p>
<p>But since live gatherings are not possible in the foreseeable future, <strong>Good Black News</strong> wants to provide another way to honor our past and present musical greats during this time. All month, we will be offering playlists from myriad genres, artists and themes save one: they will all be in tribute to African American music.</p>
<p>To kick us off first is GBN contributor<strong> Marlon West</strong>‘s expansive offering. In Marlon’s words:</p>
<p>“It’s June and that brings African-American Music Appreciation Month! While <strong>President Jimmy Carter</strong> initiated as <strong>“Black Music Month”</strong> back in 1979, I’ll admit, that I was sleeping on it until it was rebranded as African-American Music Appreciation Month by <strong>President Barack Obama</strong>.</p>
<p>In his 2016 proclamation, he noted that African-American music and musicians have helped this nation “to dance, to express our faith through song, to march against injustice, and to defend our country’s enduring promise of freedom and opportunity for all.”</p>
<p>Here’s my freewheeling, daylong, genre-jumping offering celebrating <strong>AAMAM</strong>. In the weeks to come, I’ll do deep dives on specific styles and/or artists. So get ready to immerse yourself in the music of your favorite Black artists and genres.</p>
<p>Whether it’s Jazz or Neo-Soul or classic Rhythm &amp; Blues or hip-hop, let the music speak to you. Share old favorites and the newly discovered on social media using<strong> #AfricanAmericanMusicAppreciationMonth</strong> and <strong>#AAMAM</strong>.</p>
<p>And always stay safe, sane, and kind you all. Damned if that ain’t getting harder to do the days.”</p>
