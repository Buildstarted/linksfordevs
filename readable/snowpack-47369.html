<p>Build web applications with less tooling and 10x faster iteration.</p>
<pre><code>$ npx snowpack
</code></pre>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  <strong>TL;DR</strong> - With Snowpack you can build modern web apps (using React, Vue, etc.) without a bundler (like Webpack, Parcel, Rollup). No more waiting for your bundler to rebuild your site every time you hit save. Instead, every change is reflected in the browser instantly.
</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How It Works<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#how-it-works">#</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Instead of bundling on every change, just run Snowpack <strong>once</strong> right after <code>npm install</code>.</li>
<li>Snowpack re-installs your dependencies as single JS files to a new <code>web_modules/</code> directory. <strong>It never touches your source code.</strong></li>
<li>Build your app, import those dependencies via an ESM <code>import</code>, and then run it all in the browser.</li>
<li>Skip the bundle step and see your changes reflected in the browser immediately after hitting save.</li>
<li>Keep using your favorite web frameworks and build tools! Babel &amp; TypeScript supported.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/how-does-it-work.jpg" alt="how it works illustration"></p>

<h3 id="why%3F">Why?<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#why%3F">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ever been stuck waiting for your webapp to rebuild during development? Ever heard your laptop fans go wild every time you hit save? Then you’ve experienced the cost of bundling during development.</li>
<li>Web bundlers like Webpack are powerful, but they can easily introduce a complex mess of configuration, plugins, and dependencies. Create React App, for example, installs ~200MB of dependencies and uses ~600 lines of Webpack configuration internally.</li>
<li>Bundlers became a required web development tool in the 2010’s, mainly because of npm’s use of a module format that didn’t run natively in the browser (Common.js). Before then, web developers would commonly ship development source code directly to the browser. Bundling used to be a production-only optimization (vs. the dev-time requirement it is today).</li>
<li>ESM has had ~5 years to bake in browser, and is now supported in all modern browsers (going back to early 2018). With ESM, bundlers are no longer required. You can build a modern, performant, production-ready web application without Webpack!</li>
<li><strong>Replace a rebuild-on-every-change build step (Webpack, Parcel, etc.) with a run-once install step (Snowpack) to get a faster dev environment with less tooling complexity.</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beginners!</strong> Popular starter applications usually come with 1000’s of dependencies and 100’s of lines of bundler configuration that you don’t actually need. Snowpack shrinks the number of things you need to learn&nbsp;to get started with web development. Shipping your code directly to the browser also lets you easily inspect your code in the browser, set break-points, etc. for easier feedback loops as you’re getting started.</li>
<li><strong>Anyone starting a new application!</strong> Snowpack has zero lock-in, so you can always add a traditional bundler later down the road (see our guide below). But until then, you can still use all your other favorite tools like Babel &amp; TypeScript while still getting all the dev speed improvements that come with bundler-free development.</li>
<li><strong>Anyone building an application that doesn’t change often!</strong> Have you ever gotten back into a project after a while, and spent 80% of your time at the start just updating outdated dependencies? Less tooling &amp; less configuration means there are fewer opportunities for plugin churn, breaking changes, and deprecation to hurt you.</li>
<li><strong>Anyone who thinks web development has gotten too complex!</strong> Less tooling means less to install, less complexity, less to do every time you make a change, and less to debug when something goes wrong. Removing tooling that sits between your editor and the browser also makes your Dev Tools much more useful for live debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Anyone who is interested in the future of web development!</strong> Snowpack is just one step towards a future of web development that lets us build more with less complexity and tooling overhead. And this future is here to stay.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-should-avoid-snowpack%3F">Who Should Avoid Snowpack?<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#who-should-avoid-snowpack%3F">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><s><strong>Anyone building for older browser</strong></s> <a href="#runs-in-every-browser">Snowpack now supports older browsers like IE11!</a></li>
<li><strong>Anyone who loves tooling-heavy development!</strong> This isn’t sarcastic, I promise :) By dropping the bundler, you can’t do the magic that Webpack is famous for. Using <code>import</code> to load CSS, Images, and other non-JS resources is  non-standard and unsupported in the browser (for now). You may appreciate a dev environment that is true to what standard JavaScript browsers support. Or, you may find this annoying.</li>

  </picture>
  </a>
</p>
<p>By default, Snowpack installs npm dependencies as ES Module (ESM), which run natively <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module">wherever ESM syntax is supported</a>. This includes ~90% of all browsers in use today. <strong>All modern browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari) have supported ESM since early 2018.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, Snowpack runs all dependencies through Babel via <code>@preset/env</code> to transpile any less-supported language features found in your dependencies. You can customize this behavior by setting your own “browserslist” key in your <code>package.json</code> manifest (see below).</p>
<h3 id="legacy-browser-support">Legacy Browser Support<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#legacy-browser-support">#</a></h3>
<p>
<img alt="legacy browser icons" src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/browser-logos-all.png">
</p>
<p><strong>As of v1.1, Snowpack also supports legacy browsers via the the <code>--nomodule</code> flag!</strong> This is a production-only flag that generates a legacy bundle of your entire application for older browsers that don’t understand ESM syntax. Because your application is already built to run in the browser, there’s no configuration or extra plugins required to use it.</p>
<p>If you need to support legacy browsers like <strong>IE11</strong>, <strong>UC Browser for Android</strong> (popular in China and India), <strong>Samsung Mobile</strong>, and <strong>Opera Mini</strong> then be sure to enable this feature.</p>
<p>Note that this introduces a production build step into your deployment process, if you don’t already have one. This is in addition to Snowpack’s “run-only-once-at-install-time” normal behavior, but still much lighter than Webpack/Parcel’s “run-on-every-change-at-dev-time” normal behavior.</p>
<p>Read our guide on <a href="#supporting-legacy-browsers">Supporting Legacy Browsers</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="load-performance">Load Performance<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#load-performance">#</a></h3>
<p>You can think of Snowpack like an optimized code-splitting strategy for your dependencies. Dependencies are bundled into individual files at install-time, with all internal package files bundled together as efficiently as possible. Any common, shared dependencies are moved into common, shared chunks in your <code>web_modules/</code> directory.</p>
<p>But make no mistake: unbundled applications have a different performance story than bundled applications. Cache efficiency improves significantly (especially useful if you deploy multiple times per day) and the risk of shipping duplicate code across bundles goes to zero.</p>
<p>Unlike in traditional bundled applications, long (7+) chains of imports can slow down your first page load. How you weigh these pros and cons of unbundled production applications depends on your specific application and use-case.</p>
<p>Of course, you’re always free to add a bundler as a part of your production build pipeline only and you’ll continue to get the developer experience boost. Or, just use  Snowpack to get started and then add a bundler whenever you feel you need to for performance. That’s what we did when we started www.pika.dev, and years later performance is still good.</p>
<p>To learn more about unbundled load performance, check out Max Jung’s post on <a href="https://medium.com/@asyncmax/the-right-way-to-bundle-your-assets-for-faster-sites-over-http-2-437c37efe3ff">“The Right Way to Bundle Your Assets for Faster Sites over HTTP/2”</a>. It’s the best study on HTTP/2 performance &amp; bundling we could find online, backed up by real data. Snowpack’s installation most closely matches the study’s moderate, “50 file” bundling strategy. Jung’s post found that for HTTP/2, “differences among concatenation levels below 1000 [small files] (50, 6 or 1) were negligible.”</p>
<h3 id="cache-performance">Cache Performance<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#cache-performance">#</a></h3>
<p>Snowpack performs best when it comes to caching. Snowpack keeps your dependencies separate from your application code and from each other, which gives you a super-optimized caching strategy <em>by default.</em> This lets the browser cache dependencies as efficiently as possible, and only fetch updates when individual dependencies are updated.</p>
<p>The same applies to unbundled application code as well. When you make changes to a file, the browser only needs to re-fetch that one file. This is especially useful if you manage multiple deployments a day, since only changed files need to be loaded.</p>
<h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>
<h3 id="installing-snowpack">Installing Snowpack<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#installing-snowpack">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>npm install --save-dev snowpack<br>   (or) yarn add --dev snowpack<p><br>npx snowpack</p></code></pre>
<h3 id="installing-a-dev-server">Installing a Dev Server<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#installing-a-dev-server">#</a></h3>
<p>Snowpack is agnostic to how you serve your site during development. If you have a static dev server that you already like, use it to serve your Snowpack app. Otherwise, we recommend one of the following for local development:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve"><code>serve</code></a> (recommended: popular, easy to use)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/servor"><code>servor</code></a> (recommended: has live-reload, built for SPAs)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-dev-server"><code>es-dev-server</code></a> (recommended: built for buildless workflows, efficient browser caching)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server"><code>live-server</code></a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server"><code>lite-server</code></a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync"><code>browser-sync</code></a> (honorable mentions)</li>
<li><a href="http://now.sh/"><code>now dev</code></a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/"><code>netlify dev</code></a> (if you already deploy via Zeit/Netlify)</li>

<h4 id="1.-install-your-dependencies">1. Install your dependencies</h4>
<pre><code>npm install --save preact htm
</code></pre>
<p>We’ll start this tutorial by using Preact (similar to React) &amp; HTM (similar to JSX). Even if you only want to use React and JSX, you should&nbsp;still start here. By the end of this tutorial, we’ll show how you can optionally replace Preact with React, and HTM with JSX (via Babel).</p>
<h4 id="2.-run-snowpack-to-create-your-web_modules%2F-directory">2. Run Snowpack to create your web_modules/ directory</h4>
<pre><code>npx snowpack<br>✔ snowpack installed: preact, htm. <span>[</span><span>0</span>.50s<span>]</span></code></pre>
<p>If all went well, you should see a <code>web_modules/</code> directory containing the files <code>preact.js</code> &amp; <code>htm.js</code>. This is the magic of Snowpack: any npm package can be transformed from <code>node_modules/PACKAGE_NAME</code> to <code>web_modules/PACKAGE_NAME.js</code>, a bundled, single-file JS package that runs directly in the browser with no additional tooling needed!</p>
<p>Optionally, you can now run <code>npm install snowpack --save-dev</code> to speed up future Snowpack runs &amp; run Snowpack inside of your package.json scripts. Otherwise, npx tends to re-install the tool before every run.</p>

<p>Any changes that you make to your src/app.js file are <strong>immediately</strong> reflected via either live-reload (if supported by your dev server) or a manual browser refresh. No bundlers, no build steps, and no waiting around for things to re-build after you make a change.</p>
<p>Open up your browser’s Dev Tools and debug your application directly in the browser. Browse your source code, set breakpoints, and get more useful error messages.</p>

<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h2>
<p>Snowpack has a single goal: to install web-ready npm packages to <code>web_modules/</code> directory. It doesn’t touch your source code. What you build with it, which frameworks you use, and how you serve your project locally is entirely up to you. You can use as many or as few tools on top of Snowpack as you’d like.</p>
<p>Still stuck? See our <a href="#quick-start">Quick Start</a> guide above for help&nbsp;to get started.</p>
<h3 id="zero-config-installs-(default)">Zero-Config Installs (Default)<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#zero-config-installs-(default)">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>$ npx snowpack
</code></pre>
<p>By default, Snowpack will attempt to install all “dependencies” listed in your package.json manifest. If the package defines an ESM “module” entrypoint, then that package is installed&nbsp;into your new <code>web_modules/</code> directory.</p>
<p>As long as all of your web dependencies are listed as package.json “dependencies” (with all other dependencies listed under “devDependencies”) this zero-config behavior should work well for your project.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-installs-(recommended)">Automatic Installs (Recommended)<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#automatic-installs-(recommended)">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>$ npx snowpack --include "src/**/*.js"
</code></pre>
<p>With some additional config, Snowpack is also able to automatically detect dependencies by scanning your application for import statements. This is the recommended way to use Snowpack, since it is both faster and more accurate than trying to install every dependency.</p>
<p>To enable automatic import scanning, use the <code>--include</code> CLI flag to tell Snowpack&nbsp;which files to scan for. Snowpack will automatically scan every file for imports with <code>web_modules</code> in the import path. It will then parse those to find every dependency required by your project.</p>
<p>Remember to re-run Snowpack every time you import an new dependency.</p>
<h3 id="whitelisting-dependencies">Whitelisting Dependencies<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#whitelisting-dependencies">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>  <br>  <span>"snowpack"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>"webDependencies"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><br>      <span>"htm"</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>"preact"</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>"preact/hooks"</span><span>,</span> <br>      <span>"unistore/full/preact.es.js"</span><span>,</span> <br>      <span>"bulma/css/bulma.css"</span> <br>    <span>]</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Optionally, you can also whitelist any dependencies by defining them in your “webDependencies” config (see below). You can use this to control exactly what is installed, including non-JS assets or deeper package resources.</p>
<p>Note that this config will disable the zero-config mode that attempts to install every package found in your package.json “dependencies”. Either use this together with the <code>--include</code> flag, or just make sure that you whitelist everything&nbsp;that you want installed.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s behavior can be configured by CLI flags, a custom Snowpack config file, or both. <a href="#all-configuration-options">See the table below for the full list of supported options</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cli-flags">CLI Flags<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#cli-flags">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>$ npx snowpack --optimize --clean
</code></pre>
<p>CLI flags will always be merged with (and take priority over) a config file.</p>
<h3 id="config-files">Config Files<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#config-files">#</a></h3>
<p>Snowpack supports configuration files in multiple formats. Snowpack will look for configuration in the current working directory in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>package.json</code>: A namespaced config object (<code>"snowpack": {...}</code>).</li>
<li><code>snowpack.config.js</code>: A JS file exporting a config object (<code>module.exports = {...}</code>).</li>
<li><code>snowpack.config.json</code>: A JSON file containing config (<code>{...}</code>).</li>

<p>Browsers can only import by URL, so importing a package by name requires additional tooling. Below are some options for build tools that handle the import name -&gt; URL transformation for you automatically. This can be especially useful when you are <a href="#migrating-an-existing-app">migrating an existing app to Snowpack</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Babel Support:</strong> If you use Babel with Snowpack, you can use our Babel plugin to support package name imports. The plugin reads any packages name&nbsp;imports in your source code and rewrites them to full <code>"/web_modules/${PACKAGE_NAME}.js"</code> URLs that run in the browser. This way, you can keep using the package name imports that you’re used to without needing a full web app bundler. Check out our <a href="#babel">Babel</a> guide below for instructions on setting up Babel.</p>

<p><strong>TTypeScript Support:</strong> If you use <a href="https://github.com/cevek/ttypescript">TTypescript</a> (note: this is a separate tool from TypeScript) you can use the <a href="https://github.com/Jack-Works/ttypescript-browser-like-import-transformer">@magic-works/ttypescript-browser-like-import-transformer</a> plugin to support package name imports. The transformer reads import declarations in your source code and rewrites them to full <code>"/web_modules/${PACKAGE_NAME}.js"</code> URLs that run in the browser.</p>

<h3 id="import-maps">Import Maps<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#import-maps">#</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: <a href="https://github.com/WICG/import-maps">Import Maps</a> are an experimental web technology that is not supported in every browser. For polyfilling import maps, <a href="https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims#import-maps">check out es-module-shims</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>// Include this in your application HTML...
&lt;script type="importmap" src="/web_modules/import-map.json"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
// ... to enable browser-native package name imports.
import * as _ from 'lodash';
</code></pre>
<p>Snowpack generates an <a href="https://github.com/WICG/import-maps">Import Map</a> with every installation. If your browser supports Import Maps, you can load the import map somewhere in your application and unlock the ability to import packages by name natively in the browser (no Babel step required).</p>
<h3 id="production-optimization">Production Optimization<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#production-optimization">#</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/treeshaking.jpg" alt="Tree-shaking example"></p>
<pre><code>$ npx snowpack --optimize
</code></pre>
<p>By default, Snowpack installs dependencies unminified and optimized for development. When you’re ready for production, run Snowpack with the <code>--optimize</code> flag to enable certain production-only optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minification:</strong> Dependencies will be minified (source maps included).</li>
<li><strong>Transpilation:</strong> Dependencies will be transpiled to match your application’s <a href="#customize-browser-support">browser support target</a> (in case any packages are written using too-modern language features).</li>
<li><strong>Tree-Shaking:</strong> Dependencies will have any unused code removed (when “Automatic Mode” is enabled via the <code>--include</code> flag).</li>
<li><strong>Legacy Browser Bundling:</strong> Optional, via the <code>--nomodule</code> flag (see below).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="supporting-legacy-browsers">Supporting Legacy Browsers<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#supporting-legacy-browsers">#</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/nomodule.png" alt="Nomodule example"></p>
<p>If you are building a Single Page Application (SPA), run Snowpack with <code>--nomodule</code> and pass in your application entrypoint. Then, create a second script tag in your application to point legacy browsers towards this legacy build alongside your modern <code>type="module"</code> entrypoint:</p>
<pre><code><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>module<span>"</span></span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/src/index.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>nomodule</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/web_modules/app.nomodule.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>After doing this, run Snowpack to generate a <code>/web_modules/app.nomodule.js</code> application bundle that will automatically be run on older, legacy browsers.</p>
<p>Similar to the <code>--optimize</code> flag, <code>--nomodule</code> must be run before every deployment. When using this flag, we <strong>strongly recommend</strong> scripting your deployments to guarantee that Snowpack is never skipped before a deployment (ex: <code>npm run deploy</code> or <code>npm run build:production</code>).</p>
<p>This bundle step was designed to be simple and general-purpose enough to cover any browser-ready application with zero config. But, if you do get to the point where you’d like to manually configure/control your production bundles, we’d recommend <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#migrating-off-of-snowpack">setting up a bundler yourself</a> separately from Snowpack.</p>
<h3 id="caching-in-the-browser">Caching in the Browser<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#caching-in-the-browser">#</a></h3>
<p>The unbundled applications that Snowpack allows you to build can be ultra cache-efficient, with zero code duplication across page loads. But proper caching requires some helpful information from the server. Below is a list of caching strategies for your server that you can use with Snowpack.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag support</a> is the easiest caching strategy to implement, and many hosting providers (like Zeit) will enable this for you automatically. From MDN:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ETag HTTP response header is an identifier for a specific version of a resource. It lets caches be more efficient and save bandwidth, as a web server does not need to resend a full response if the content has not changed. Additionally, etags help prevent simultaneous updates of a resource from overwriting each other (“mid-air collisions”).
– <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="service-workers">Service Workers</h4>
<p>Service workers can implement a client-side cache for your site regardless of what your server responses look like. Check out this article on <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/caching-files-with-service-worker">"Caching Files with Service Worker
"</a>, and be sure to read our <a href="#Workbox">Workbox</a> guide below for help using <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/">Workbox</a> with Snowpack.</p>
<h4 id="automatic-cache-busting-via-import-url">Automatic Cache Busting via Import URL</h4>
<p>The browser cache is keyed by unique resource URL. This means that different URL query params will result in different cache hits (and cache misses) even if the server ignores them. Applications built with <a href="#babel">Babel</a> can leverage this behavior to automatically control the cache.</p>
<p>The Snowpack Babel plugin supports an <code>"addVersion"</code> option that will automatically add the package version of any package import as a query parameter of the import URL in the final build. This effectively creates a new cache entry every time a dependency changes, which allows your server to send more aggressive long-term cache headers for the <code>web_modules/</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code><br><span>"plugins"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><br>  <span>[</span><span>"snowpack/assets/babel-plugin.js"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"addVersion"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><br><span>]</span></code></pre>

<h3 id="customize-transpilation">Customize Transpilation<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#customize-transpilation">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>  <br>  <span>"browserslist"</span><span>:</span> <span>" &gt;0.75%, not ie 11, not UCAndroid &gt;0, not OperaMini all"</span><span>,</span></code></pre>
<p>Snowpack runs all dependencies through Babel (via <code>@preset/env</code>) to transpile unsupported language features in your dependencies. This is useful when packages rely on modern language features that your users’ browsers&nbsp;may not support.</p>
<p>By default, Snowpack will transpile using the recommended target string shown above. You you can customize this behavior by setting your own top-level “browserslist” key in your <code>package.json</code> manifest.</p>
<h3 id="run-after-every-install">Run After Every Install<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#run-after-every-install">#</a></h3>
<pre><code>  <br>  <span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>"prepare"</span><span>:</span> <span>"snowpack"</span><br>  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>You can optionally add “snowpack” as a <code>"prepare"</code> script to your <code>package.json</code> and npm/yarn will automatically run it after every new dependency install. This is recommended so that new dependencies are automatically included in your <code>web_modules/</code> directory immediately.</p>
<h3 id="importing-css">Importing CSS<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#importing-css">#</a></h3>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>'./style.css'</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>No browser today supports importing a CSS file directly from JS. Instead, you’ll want to use one of the following libraries/solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Recommended!</strong> If you’re building a simple app, consider defining your CSS inside your HTML using a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> block.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended!</strong> <a href="https://github.com/lukejacksonn/csz">csz</a> - “Runtime CSS modules with SASS like preprocessing”</li>
<li><a href="https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/core">@emotion/core</a> - “Simple styling in React.” (Requires Babel)</li>
<li>Most CSS-in-JS libraries will work without a bundler, although some may require extra Babel plugins to work.</li>

<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>'./photo.png'</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>No browser today supports importing an image directly from JS. Instead, you’ll want to use one of the following libraries/solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Recommended!</strong> Keep referencing images by URL. You can put any image URL directly into an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> src tag: <code>&lt;img src="/img/photo.png"&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="custom-rollup-plugins">Custom Rollup Plugins<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#custom-rollup-plugins">#</a></h3>
<p>You may encounter non-JS npm packages that can only run with additional parsing/processing. Svelte packages, for example, commonly include <code>.svelte</code> files that will require additional tooling to parse and install for the browser.</p>
<p>In these rare cases, you can add your own Rollup plugins to your <a href="#configuration-options">Snowpack config</a> to handle these special files:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>const</span> rollupPluginSvelte <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'rollup-plugin-svelte'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p>module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span><br>  rollup<span>:</span> <span>{</span><br>    plugins<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>rollupPluginSvelte</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>  <span>}</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#using-plugins">Rollup’s documentation on plugins</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="guides">Guides</h2>
<p>Snowpack dramatically speeds up your development time by removing the need for a web application bundler. But you can still use build tools like Babel or TypeScript and get the same speed improvements without the bundler. On every change, your build tool will only need to update a single file, instead of entire bundles.</p>
<p>Below are a collection of guides for using different web frameworks and build tools with Snowpack. If you’d like to add your own, feel free to hit the pencil icon in the top-right to edit our docs.</p>
<h3 id="babel">Babel<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#babel">#</a></h3>
<p>To use Babel with Snowpack:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that your entire application lives inside a source directory (ex: <code>src/</code>).</li>
<li>Run Babel to build your <code>src/</code> application to an output <code>lib/</code> directory (ex: <code>babel src/ --out-dir lib --watch</code>)</li>
<li>Update your HTML entrypoint to point to your <code>lib/</code> directory.</li>
<li>Now make changes to your <code>src/</code> directory, and see them build instantly.</li>
<li>Optional: Check out our Babel plugin for importing packages by name in the guide above.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="typescript">TypeScript<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#typescript">#</a></h3>
<p>TypeScript expects imports to be by package name, and won’t be able to understand your “web_modules/” imports by default. You’ll need to follow one of the following guides based on your setup:</p>
<h4 id="with-babel-(recommended)">With Babel (Recommended)</h4>
<p>If you build your site with Babel, you can keep importing packages by name thanks to our <a href="#importing-packages-by-name">Snowpack Plugin</a>. TypeScript will be able to understand these “package name imports” and properly map them back to the type definitions found in your <code>node_modules/</code> directory when it type checks your source directory.</p>
<p>To use TypeScript with Babel, <a href="#babel">set up Babel</a> with the following plugins (feel free to add others):</p>
<pre><code><br><span>{</span><br>  <span>"presets"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"@babel/preset-typescript"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"plugins"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"snowpack/assets/babel-plugin.js"</span><span>]</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Once you have Babel building your site correctly, TypeScript should be able to understand your source directory without any additional configuration.</p>
<h4 id="without-babel%3A">Without Babel:</h4>
<p>To use TypeScript with Snowpack, you’ll need to set up your tsconfig.json to understand “web_module” import paths. See our annotated tsconfig.json example below:</p>
<pre><code><span>"compilerOptions"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>"target"</span><span>:</span> <span>"es2017"</span><span>,</span><br>  <br>  <span>"module"</span><span>:</span> <span>"esnext"</span><span>,</span><br>  <br>  <span>"moduleResolution"</span><span>:</span> <span>"node"</span><span>,</span><br>  <br>  <span>"baseUrl"</span><span>:</span> <span>"."</span><span>,</span><br>  <br>  <span>"paths"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><br>      <span>"/web_modules/*.js"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><br>          <span>"node_modules/@types/*"</span><span>,</span><br>          <span>"node_modules/*"</span><span>,</span><br>          <span>"web_modules/*.js"</span><br>      <span>]</span><br>  <span>}</span><span>,</span><br>  <br><span>}</span></code></pre>

<pre><code><span>import</span> React<span>,</span> <span>{</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'/web_modules/react.js'</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> React is <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11503">not yet published with ES Module support</a>, and the way that it’s written makes it impossible to install as a dependency (<em>“Error: ‘__moduleExports’ is not exported by node_modules/react/index.js”</em>). <strong>However</strong>, React is still supported thanks to our actively-maintained ESM builds of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pika/react">React</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pika/react">React-DOM</a>. You can install them both in your project under an alias like so:</p>
<pre><code>npm install react@npm:@pika/react react-dom@npm:@pika/react-dom
   yarn add react@npm:@pika/react react-dom@npm:@pika/react-dom
</code></pre>
<p>When installed under the react/react-dom alias, all tooling (including Snowpack) will benefit from these easier-to-analyze ESM distributions of the popular packages.</p>
<h3 id="jsx">JSX<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#jsx">#</a></h3>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that JSX isn’t really JavaScript. JSX is a build-time syntax that only your build tooling understands, and that doesn’t run directly in any browser. In any app you work on (bundled or unbundled) you’ll need to use a build tool like Babel or TypeScript to transpile JSX into regular old JavaScript before shipping it to the browser.</p>
<p>To use JSX with Snowpack, you can either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use TypeScript with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html">“–jsx” mode</a> enabled. See our “TypeScript” guide for more.</li>
<li>Use Babel with a plugin like <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx">@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx</a> or a framework-specific preset like <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react">@babel/preset-react</a>. See our “Babel” guide for more.</li>
<li>Use a JSX-like alternative that can run in the browser. Jason Miller’s <a href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a> is a great option (keep reading).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="htm">HTM<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#htm">#</a></h3>
<p>HTM is “a JSX alternative using […] JSX-like syntax in plain JavaScript - no transpiler necessary.” It has first-class support for Preact (built by the same team) but also works with React.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pika.dev/">https://www.pika.dev</a> happily used HTM + Preact for many months before adding Babel and switching to React + TypeScript.</p>

<p><a href="https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/">lit-html</a> is “an efficient, expressive, extensible HTML templating library for JavaScript.” Similarly to <a href="#htm">HTM</a>, lit-html uses tagged template literals for JSX-like syntax in the browser without requiring any transpilation.</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span> html <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"/web_modules/lit-html.js"</span><span>;</span><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span> until <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"/web_modules/lit-html/directives/until.js"</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> There should only ever be one version of lit-html run in the browser. If you are using third-party packages that also depend on lit-html, we strongly recommend adding <code>"lit-html"</code> to your <a href="#all-config-options">dedupe</a> config to prevent Snowpack from installing multiple versions:</p>
<pre><code><br>  <span>"snowpack"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><br>    <br>    <span>"dedupe"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"lit-html"</span><span>]</span><br>  <span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> <a href="https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/guide/template-reference#built-in-directives">lit-html directives</a> aren’t exported by the main package. Run Snowpack with the <code>--include</code> flag so that Snowpack can automatically detect these imports in your application. Otherwise, add them each separately to the <code>webDependencies</code> whitelist in your <code>package.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code><br>  <span>"snowpack"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>"webDependencies"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><br>      <span>"lit-html"</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>"lit-html/directives/until.js"</span><span>,</span><br>    <span>]</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jakedeichert/svelvet">Svelvet</a> is a <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte">Svelte</a> compiler + dev environment that integrates directly with Snowpack. Svelvet watches your source directory and compiles your Svelte components to standard, browser-ready JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code><br><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>    <span>import</span> Header <span>from</span> <span>'./components/Header'</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>import</span> Footer <span>from</span> <span>'./components/Footer/index'</span><span>;</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Header</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Footer</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Run <code>npx svelvet</code> on the command line to start Svelvet in dev mode. For more information on Svelvet and instructions on how to build for production, <a href="https://github.com/jakedeichert/svelvet">check out the full guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sass">SASS<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#sass">#</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> is a “mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language” that compiles to CSS. Use the <a href="https://sass-lang.com/install">SASS CLI</a> to compile your SASS into CSS, and then load that CSS anywhere in your application.</p>
<p><strong>You might also like:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/lukejacksonn/csz">csz</a>, run-time CSS modules with support for SASS-like selectors. CSZ runs directly in the browser, so you can skip the SASS build/watch step.</p>
<h3 id="tailwind-css">Tailwind CSS<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#tailwind-css">#</a></h3>

<p>Tailwind works as-expected with Snowpack. Just follow <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/">the official Tailwind Install Guide</a>. When you get to step #4 (“Process your CSS with Tailwind”) choose the official Tailwind CLI option to generate your CSS. Import that generated CSS file in your HTML application.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-cli">Workbox CLI</a> integrates well with Snowpack. Run the wizard to bootstrap your first configuration file, and then run <code>workbox generateSW</code> to generate your service worker.</p>
<p>Remember that Workbox expects to be run every time you deploy, as a part of a production “build” process (similar to how Snowpack’s <a href="#production-optimization"><code>--optimize</code></a> flag works). If you don’t have one yet, create a <a href="https://michael-kuehnel.de/tooling/2018/03/22/helpers-and-tips-for-npm-run-scripts.html"><code>"deploy"</code> and/or <code>"build"</code> script</a> in your <code>package.json</code> to automate your production build process.</p>
<h3 id="migrating-an-existing-app">Migrating an Existing App<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#migrating-an-existing-app">#</a></h3>
<p>How you migrate an existing app to Snowpack depends on which Bundler features/plugins you’re using. If you’re only using the <code>import</code> statement to import other JavaScript files, the process should only take a couple of minutes. If you’re importing CSS, images, or other non-JS content in your application, you’ll need to first get rid of those Webpack-specific imports before migrating away from Webpack.</p>
<p>Assuming you’ve removed all code specific to your bundler, you can use the following rough plan to migrate to Snowpack.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Babel to assist in the migration. If you don’t want to use Babel, don’t worry; You can always remove it after migrating.</li>
<li>Follow the Babel guide above to build your existing <code>src/</code> directory to a new <code>lib/</code> directory.</li>
<li>Follow the Babel Plugin guide above to add the Snowpack Babel plugin so that your package imports will continue to run as is. Check your output <code>lib/</code> directory to make sure that dependency imports are being rewritten as expected.</li>
<li>Run your application in the browser! If everything is working, you’re done! Otherwise, use your browser’s dev tools to hunt down any remaining issues in your application code.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="migrating-to-webpack%2Fparcel">Migrating to Webpack/Parcel<a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#migrating-to-webpack%2Fparcel">#</a></h3>
<p>Snowpack is designed for zero lock-in. If you ever feel the need to add a traditional application bundler to your stack (for whatever reason!) you can do so in seconds.</p>
<p>Any application built with Snowpack should Just Work™️ when passed through Webpack/Rollup/Parcel. If you are importing packages by full URL (ex: <code>import React from '/web_modules/react.js'</code>), then a simple Find &amp; Replace should help you re-write them to the plain package names  (ex: <code>import React from 'react'</code>) that bundlers expect.</p>
