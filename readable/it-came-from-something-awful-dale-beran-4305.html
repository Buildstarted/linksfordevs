<h3>Praise for It Came from Something Awful</h3>
<div id="reviewsList">
<div> <p>“I’d be tempted to call Dale Beran a wizard of prose, able to turn the dredges of the internet into a riveting, sparkling narrative—except, in the world of this book, a ‘wizard’ is a lifelong virgin. Instead, I'll say that not since Hunter Thompson got his ass kicked by the Hells Angels has a writer turned a subculture so confoundingly foul into a book so fine.” —Baynard Woods, syndicated columnist, author of <em>Coffin Point</em><br><em></em><br><em></em>“If you're a normie who can't quite wrap your head around exactly why so many Internet goons have anime girl avatars, or how popular online political action shifted from occupying Zuccotti Park to mass trolling actress Leslie Jones and the female reboot of <em>Ghostbusters</em>, then Beran's book provides a good overview of Internet culture. But he also gets at the undergirding feeling behind all these actions…a convincing argument that we're all caught up in simulations of political change rather than actually affecting it.” —Andrew Limbong,<em> NPR</em></p><p> “Any page of <em>It Came From Something Awful</em> would be the most shocking page of most books. Reading Dale Beran’s chronicle of 4chan, the anonymous imageboard where some of the internet’s worst scandals have been fomented, feels like scrolling through the forum itself…Beran explores the psychology of young, disenfranchised masculinity that 4chan represents and the sociopolitical context that molded its minds.” —Emma Grey Wallis, <em>Wired</em></p><p>"Beran recounts 4chan.net's history as a social media platform fo… <a aria-describedby="reviewsList">More…</a></p></div>

It's a blow-by-blow study of the devolution of American culture, especially during the past few years: the rise of the radical "proud boys"; the use of the word "cuck" to insult liberals; the proliferation of offensive memes; the seemingly endless racist, inflammatory rhetoric; and the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was hit by a car driven by a white supremacist in Charlottesville in 2017—an event that prompted Donald Trump to say there were good people on both sides." —<em>Kirkus</em></p><p> -
