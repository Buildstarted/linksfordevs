<p><span>By Brandon Azad, Project Zero</span></p>
<p><span>At 3 PM PDT on May 23, 2020, the unc0ver jailbreak was </span><a href="https://github.com/pwn20wndstuff/Undecimus/releases/tag/v5.0.0"><span>released</span></a><span> for iOS 13.5 (the latest signed version at the time of release) using a zero-day vulnerability and heavy obfuscation. By 7 PM, I had identified the vulnerability and informed Apple. By 1 AM, I had sent Apple a POC and my analysis. This post takes you along that journey.</span></p>

<p><span>I wanted to find the vulnerability used in unc0ver and report it to Apple quickly in order to demonstrate that obfuscating an exploit does little to prevent the bug from winding up in the hands of bad actors.</span></p>
<p><span>After downloading and extracting the unc0ver IPA, I loaded the main executable into IDA to take a look. Unfortunately, the binary was heavily obfuscated, so finding the bug statically was beyond my abilities.</span></p>
<div dir="ltr">
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mPArr_KTggU/XwcyKsCrzLI/AAAAAAAAQas/K3f_yUrg8lEuc7V_TnVTEntqEzbepnuiQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/image1.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Image showing a screenshot of IDA Pro with heavily obfuscated code" data-original-height="851" data-original-width="1600" height="340" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mPArr_KTggU/XwcyKsCrzLI/AAAAAAAAQas/K3f_yUrg8lEuc7V_TnVTEntqEzbepnuiQCNcBGAsYHQ/s640/image1.png" title="" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><br></span>
<span><br></span>
<span>Next I loaded the unc0ver app onto an iPod Touch 7 running iOS 13.2.3 to try running the exploit. Exploring the app interface didn't suggest that the user had any sort of control over which vulnerability was used to exploit the device, so I hoped that unc0ver only had support for the one 0-day and did not use the </span><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1986"><span>oob_timestamp</span></a><span> bug instead on iOS 13.3 and lower.</span></p></div>
<p><span>As I was clicking the "Jailbreak" button, a thought occurred to me: Having written a few kernel exploits before, I understood that most memory-corruption-based exploits have something of a "critical section" during which kernel state has been corrupted and the system would be unstable if the rest of the exploit did not continue. So, on a whim, I double clicked the home button to bring up the app switcher and killed the unc0ver app.</span></p>
<p><span>The device immediately panicked.</span></p>
<p><span>panic(cpu 1 caller 0xfffffff020e75424): "</span><span>Zone cache element was used after free!</span><span> Element 0xffffffe0033ac810 was corrupted at beginning; Expected 0x87be6c0681be12b8 but found 0xffffffe003059d90; canary 0x784193e68284daa8; zone 0xfffffff021415fa8 (</span><span>kalloc.16</span><span>)"</span></p>

<p><span>This seemed promising! I had a panic message saying there was a use-after-free in the </span><span>kalloc.16</span><span> allocation zone (general purpose allocations of size up to 16 bytes). However, it was possible that this was a symptom of the memory corruption rather than the source of the memory corruption (or even a decoy!). To investigate further, I'd need to analyze the backtrace.</span></p>
<p><span>While waiting for IDA to process the iPod's kernelcache, I tried a few more off-the-cuff experiments. Since many exploits use Mach ports as a fundamental primitive, I wrote an app that would churn up the </span><span>ipc.ports</span><span> zone, creating fragmentation and mixing up the freelist. When I ran the unc0ver app afterwards the exploit still worked, suggesting that it may not rely on heap grooming of Mach port allocations.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, since the panic log mentioned </span><span>kalloc.16</span><span>, I decided to write an app that would continuously allocate and free to </span><span>kalloc.16</span><span> in the background during the unc0ver exploit. The idea was that if unc0ver relies on reallocating a </span><span>kalloc.16</span><span> allocation, then my app might grab that slot instead, which would likely cause the exploit strategy to fail and possibly result in a kernel panic. And sure enough, with my app hammering </span><span>kalloc.16</span><span> in the background,&nbsp; touching the "Jailbreak" button caused an immediate kernel panic.</span></p>
<p><span>As a sanity check, I tried changing my app to hammer a different zone, </span><span>kalloc.32</span><span>, instead of </span><span>kalloc.16</span><span>. This time the exploit ran successfully, suggesting that </span><span>kalloc.16</span><span> is indeed the critical allocation zone used by the exploit.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, once IDA had finished analyzing the iPod kernelcache, I started symbolicating the stacktraces collected from the panic logs.</span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span><span>&nbsp; lr: 0x00000001bf085ae4</span></p>
<p><span>The call to </span><span>lio_listio()</span><span> immediately stood out to me. Not long before I had finished writing </span><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/06/a-survey-of-recent-ios-kernel-exploits.html"><span>a survey of recent iOS kernel exploits</span></a><span>, and I happened to remember that </span><span>lio_listio()</span><span> was the vulnerable syscall used in the </span><a href="https://www.synacktiv.com/posts/exploit/lightspeed-a-race-for-an-iosmacos-sandbox-escape.html"><span>LightSpeed</span></a><span>-based exploits. I reread the blog post from Synacktiv to get a sense of the bug and immediately another piece fell into place: the target object that is double-freed in the LightSpeed race is an </span><span>aio_lio_context</span><span> object that lives in </span><span>kalloc.16</span><span>. Also, the large number of threads in the unc0ver app further supported the idea of a race condition.</span></p>
<p><span>At this point I felt I had enough evidence to reach out to Apple with a preliminary analysis suggesting that the bug was LightSpeed, either a variant or a regression.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Next I wanted to confirm the bug by writing a POC to trigger the issue. I tried the </span><a href="https://github.com/Synacktiv-contrib/lightspeed/blob/master/lightspeed.c"><span>original POC</span></a><span> shown in the LightSpeed blog post, but after a minute of running it hadn't yet panicked. This suggested to me that perhaps the 0-day was a variant of the original LightSpeed bug.</span></p>
<p><span>To find out more, I started two lines of investigation: looking at the </span><a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-6153.81.5/bsd/kern/kern_aio.c.auto.html"><span>XNU sources</span></a><span> to try and spot the bug, and using </span><a href="https://checkra.in/"><span>checkra1n</span></a><span>/</span><a href="https://github.com/checkra1n/pongoOS"><span>pongoOS</span></a><span> to patch </span><span>lio_listio()</span><span> in the kernelcache and then running the exploit. From the sources I couldn't see how the original vulnerability was fixed at all, which didn't make sense to me. So instead I focused my effort on kernel patching.</span></p>
<p><span>Booting a patched kernelcache is tricky but doable because of </span><a href="https://twitter.com/axi0mX/status/1177542201670168576"><span>checkm8</span></a><span>. I downloaded checkra1n and booted the iPod into the pongoOS shell. Using the example from the pongoOS repo as a guide, I created a loadable pongo module that would disable the checkra1n kernel patches and instead apply my own patches. (I disabled the checkra1n kernel patches because I was worried that unc0ver would detect checkra1n and engage anti-analysis measures.)</span></p>
<p><span>My first test was just to insert invalid instruction opcodes into the </span><span>lio_listio()</span><span> function so that it would panic if called. Surprisingly, the device booted just fine, and then once I clicked "Jailbreak" it panicked. This meant that unc0ver was the only process calling </span><span>lio_listio()</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>I next patched the code responsible for allocating the </span><span>aio_lio_context</span><span> object that is double-freed in the original LightSpeed bug so that it would be allocated from </span><span>kalloc.48</span><span> instead of </span><span>kalloc.16</span><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>FFFFFFF0074D5D54</span><span> &nbsp; &nbsp; MOV &nbsp; &nbsp; W8, #</span><span>0xC</span><span> </span><span>; patched to #0x23</span></p>

<p><span>FFFFFFF0074D5D68</span><span> &nbsp; &nbsp; MOV &nbsp; &nbsp; W1, #</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>; can block</span></p>
<p><span>FFFFFFF0074D5D6C</span><span> &nbsp; &nbsp; BL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>kalloc_canblock</span></p>
<p><span>FFFFFFF0074D5D70</span><span> &nbsp; &nbsp; CBZ &nbsp; &nbsp; X0, loc_FFFFFFF0074D6234</span></p>
<p><span>FFFFFFF0074D5D74</span><span> &nbsp; &nbsp; MOV &nbsp; &nbsp; X19, X0 </span><span>; lio_context</span></p>
<p><span>FFFFFFF0074D5D78</span><span> &nbsp; &nbsp; MOV &nbsp; &nbsp; W1, #</span><span>0xC</span><span> </span><span>; size_t</span></p>
<p><span>FFFFFFF0074D5D7C</span><span> &nbsp; &nbsp; BL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>_bzero</span></p>
<p><span>The idea is that increasing the object's allocation size will cause unc0ver's exploit strategy to fail because it will try to replace the accidentally-freed </span><span>kalloc.48</span><span> context object with a replacement object from </span><span>kalloc.16</span><span>, which simply cannot occur. And sure enough, with this patch in place, unc0ver stalled at the "Exploiting kernel" step without actually panicking.</span></p>
<p><span>I then ran a few more experiments patching various points in the function to dump the arguments and data buffers passed to </span><span>lio_listio()</span><span> so that I could compare against the values used in the original LightSpeed POC. The idea was that if I noticed any substantial differences, that would point me in the direction of the variant in the source. However, other than the field </span><span>aio_reqprio</span><span> being set to </span><span>'gang'</span><span>, there were no differences between the arguments passed to </span><span>lio_listio()</span><span> by unc0ver and those in the original POC.</span></p>
<p><span>At this point it looked like the 0-day might actually be the original LightSpeed bug itself, not a variant, so I returned to the original POC to see if perhaps the reason it wasn't triggering was that a specific technique used had been mitigated. The code responsible for reallocating the </span><span>kalloc.16</span><span> allocation caught my eye:</span></p>
<p><span>/*</span><span> not mandatory but used to make the race more likely </span><span>*/</span></p>
<p><span>/*</span><span> this poll() will force a kalloc16 of a struct poll_continue_args </span><span>*/</span></p>
<p><span>/*</span><span> with its second dword as 0 (to collide with lio_context-&gt;io_issued == 0) </span><span>*/</span></p>
<p><span>/*</span><span> this technique is quite slow (1ms waiting time) and better ways to do so exists </span><span>*/</span></p>
<p><span>int</span><span> n = </span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>NULL</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>1</span><span>);</span></p>
<p><span>I hadn't ever seen </span><span>poll()</span><span> used as a reallocation primitive before. Intuitively it felt like using Mach port based reallocation strategies was more promising, so I replaced this code with an out-of-line Mach ports spray copied from oob_timestamp. Sure enough, that was the only change required to make the POC trigger reliably in a few seconds.</span></p>

<p><span>After I had a working POC, I retried the original LightSpeed POC and found that it would eventually panic if left to run for long enough. Thus, this is </span><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1806#c14"><span>another</span></a><span> case of a reintroduced bug that could have been identified by simple regression tests.</span></p>
<p><span>So, let's return to the sources to see if we can figure out what happened. As mentioned earlier, when I first checked the XNU sources to see how the </span><span>lio_listio()</span><span> patch might have been broken, I actually couldn't identify how the bug was originally patched at all. In retrospect, this isn't all that far off.</span></p>
<p><span>The original </span><a href="https://www.synacktiv.com/posts/exploit/lightspeed-a-race-for-an-iosmacos-sandbox-escape.html"><span>LightSpeed blog post</span></a><span> describes the vulnerability very well, so I won't rehash it all here; I highly recommend reading that post. From a high level, the bug is that the semantics of which function frees the </span><span>aio_lio_context</span><span> object are unclear, as both the worker threads that perform the asynchronous I/O and the </span><span>lio_listio()</span><span> function itself could do it.</span></p>
<p><span>As mentioned in the post, the original fix for this bug was just to not free the </span><span>aio_lio_context</span><span> object in the cases in which it might be double-freed:</span></p>
<p><span>On the one hand, this patch fixes the potential </span><span>UaF</span><span> on the </span><span>lio_context</span><span>. But on the other hand, the error case that was handled before the fix is now ignored... As a result it is possible to make </span><span>lio_listio()</span><span> allocate an </span><span>aio_lio_context</span><span> that will never be freed by the kernel. This gives us a silly DoS that will also crash the recent kernels (iOS 12 included).</span></p>
<p><span>[...]</span></p>
<p><span>For the rest, we will see in the future if Apple bothers to fix the little </span><span>DoS</span><span> they introduced with the patch :D</span></p>
<p><span>It turns out that Apple did eventually decide to fix the memory leak in iOS 13... but in doing so it appears they reintroduced the race condition double-free:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>case</span><span> LIO_NOWAIT:</span></p>
<p><span>+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>/* If no IOs were issued must free it (rdar://problem/45717887) */</span></p>
<p><span>+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>if</span><span> (lio_context-&gt;io_issued == </span><span>0</span><span>) {</span></p>
<p><span>+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; free_context = </span><span>TRUE</span><span>;</span></p>
<p><span>+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>break</span><span>;</span></p>
<p><span>The code in iOS 13 isn't </span><span>exactly</span><span> the same as iOS 11, but it's semantically equivalent. Anyone who had remembered and understood the original LightSpeed bug could have easily identified this as a regression by reviewing XNU source diffs. And anyone who ran relatively simple regression tests would have found this issue trivially.</span></p>
<p><span>So, to summarize: the LightSpeed bug was fixed in iOS 12 with a patch that didn't address the root cause and instead just turned the race condition double-free into a memory leak. Then, in iOS 13, this memory leak was identified as a bug and "fixed" by reintroducing the original bug, again without addressing the root cause of the issue. And this security regression could have been found trivially by running the original POC from the blog post.</span></p>
<p><span>You can read more about this regression in a </span><a href="https://www.synacktiv.com/posts/exploit/return-of-the-ios-sandbox-escape-lightspeeds-back-in-the-race.html"><span>followup post</span></a><span> on the Synacktiv blog.</span></p>

<p><span>The combination of the SockPuppet regression in iOS 12.4 and the LightSpeed regression in iOS 13 strongly suggests that Apple did not run effective regression tests on at least these old security bugs (and these were </span><span>very</span><span> public bugs that got a lot of attention). Running effective regression tests is a necessity for basic software testing, and a common starting point for exploitation.</span></p>
<p><span>Still, I'm very happy that Apple patched this issue in a timely manner once the exploit became public. The reality here is that attackers figure out these issues very quickly, long before the public POC is released. Thus the window of opportunity to exploit regressions is substantial.</span></p>

<p><span>Also, my goal in trying to identify the bug used by unc0ver was to demonstrate that obfuscation does not block attackers from quickly weaponizing the exploited vulnerability. It turned out that I was lucky in my analysis: my experience writing kernel exploits let me quickly figure out an alternative strategy to find the bug, and I happened to already be familiar with the specific vulnerability used because I've been keeping track of past exploits. But anyone in the business of using exploits against Apple users would also have these same advantages.</span></p>
