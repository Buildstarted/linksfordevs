However theres currently several issues that makes that change quite heavy to implement.</p><p>If analyzers are loaded to solution/projects and compilation is done with analyzers i think current version of CSharpDiagnostics should return analytic results (attleast with very small change if i am right). However OmnisharpWorkspace doesn't support analyzers and theres ongoing work to move to MSBuildWorkspace (am i right?) which makes writing that implementation at this point quite obsolete. It requires analyzer assembly loaders etc to be written etc...</p><p>This version compiles results on its own and uses minimal version of analyzer loading (directly loads them from extension assemblies), which isn't as fancy as full blown solution but is step to impelement this correctly. There also caps which i don't understand how analyzers should be loaded at the end to full blown workspace, but it's something i need to study. Basically next thing is to support project scoped analyzers which need to dig deeper at those and it may be smart to wait MsBuildWorkspace at that point.</p><p>Another issue with <code>CSharpDiagnosticService</code> was that it seems (as i stated at message before) that it seems that it isn't used with vscode at all. (never gets called, events never surface etc, actually vscode addon misses definition for /diagnostic). It may be used in some different environment like VIM but no'one hasn't answered for that yet. This is something i think requires updates from vscode extension, but i havent figured it out yet how it should be done.</p><p>So shortly: minimal version without breaking anything existing towards better solution and for this reason i think i shouldn't try to merge CSharpDiagnosticService and this at this point. Its something that is determined later on.</p></div></div></div></div>
