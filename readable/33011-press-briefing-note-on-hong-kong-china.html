      <br>The High Commissioner&nbsp;condemns any form of violence or destruction  of property and urges&nbsp;everyone participating in the demonstrations to  express their views in a peaceful way.&nbsp;She notes the Chief Executive’s  commitment to “engage as widely as possible” and to “listen to the grievances  of the people of Hong Kong.” She calls on the authorities and the people of  Hong Kong to&nbsp;engage in an open and inclusive dialogue aimed at resolving  all issues peacefully.&nbsp;This is the only sure way to achieve long-term  political stability and public security by creating channels for people to  participate in public affairs and decisions affecting their lives. 
      <br>The rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and the right  to participate in public affairs are expressly recognized in the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the International Covenant on Civil and  Political Rights which is incorporated in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR.</p><p>The UN Human Rights Office has reviewed credible  evidence of law enforcement officials employing less-lethal weapons in ways  that are prohibited by international norms and standards. For example,  officials can be seen firing tear gas canisters into crowded, enclosed areas  and directly at individual protesters on multiple occasions, creating a  considerable risk of death or serious injury. The Office would urge the Hong  Kong SAR authorities to investigate these incidents immediately, to ensure  security personnel comply with the rules of engagement, and where necessary,  amend the rules of engagement for law enforcement officials in response to  protests where these may not conform with international standards.</p><p>The Office urges the Hong Kong SAR authorities to act  with restraint, to ensure that the right of those who are expressing their  views peacefully are respected and protected, while ensuring that the response  by law enforcement officials to any violence that may take place is  proportionate and in conformity with international standards on the use of  force, including the principles of necessity and proportionality. </p><p>ENDS</p><p><em>For more information and media requests,  please contact: Rupert Colville -&nbsp;</em><em>+ 41 22 917 9767 / </em><a href="mailto:rcolville@ohchr.org"><em>rcolville@ohchr.org</em></a><em>or Ravina Shamdasani -&nbsp;</em><em>+&nbsp;</em><em>41 22 917 9169 /&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rshamdasani@ohchr.org" target="_blank">rshamdasani@ohchr.org</a></em><br><strong><em>Tag and share -&nbsp;Twitter:&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="http://twitter.com/UNHumanRights" target="_blank"><strong>@UNHumanRights</strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;and Facebook:&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/unitednationshumanrights" target="_blank"><strong>unitednationshumanrights</strong></a></p><br></div></div></div></div>
