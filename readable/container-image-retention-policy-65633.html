          <h5>What are the Docker Terms of Service?</h5>
          <p>The Docker Terms of Service is an agreement between you and Docker that governs your use of Docker products and services. Click on the link to view the full <a href="https://www.docker.com/legal">Docker Terms of Service</a>.</p>
                    

                                

                    
          </div>                  <div>
          <h5>When do the Docker Terms of Service take effect?</h5>
          
                    

                                

                    
          </div>                  <div>
          <h5>What changes is Docker making to the Terms of Service?</h5>
          <p>The most notable changes are in Section 2.5. To see all of the changes, we recommend you read the full <a href="https://www.docker.com/legal">Docker Terms of Service</a>.</p>

          <h5>What is a container image retention limit and how does it affect my account?</h5>
          <p>Image retention is based on the activity of each individual image stored within a user account. If an image has not either been pulled or pushed in the amount of time specified in your subscription plan, the image will be tagged “inactive.” Any images that are tagged as “inactive” will be scheduled for deletion. Only accounts that are on the <strong>Free</strong> individual or organization plans will be subject to image retention limits. A new dashboard will also be available in Docker Hub that offers the ability to view the status of all of your container images.</p>

          <h5>What are the new container image retention limits?</h5>
          <p>Docker is introducing a container image retention policy which will be enforced starting November 1, 2020. The container image retention policy will apply to the following plans:</p>
                    

                                <div>
                                                
                                                  <ul>
                                                                                                                                  <li><i></i>
                                                
                        

                        Free plans will have a 6 month image retention limit
                      </li>
                                                                                                                                  <li><i></i>
                                                
                        

                        Pro and Team plans will have unlimited image retention
                      </li>
                                      </ul>
                                          </div>

                    
          </div>                  <div>
          <h5>What is an “inactive” image?</h5>
          <p>An inactive image is a container image that has not been either pushed or pulled from the image repository in 6 or months.</p>
                    

                                

                    
          </div>                  <div>
          <h5>How can I view the status of my images?</h5>
          <p>All images in your Docker Hub repository have a “Last pushed” date and can easily be accessed in the Repositories view when logged into your account. A new dashboard will also be available in Docker Hub that offers the ability to view the status of all of your container images.</p>
                    

                                

                    
          </div>                  <div>
          <h5>What will happen to inactive images once the expiration date is reached?</h5>
          <p>Beginning November 1, 2020, any images that are marked as “inactive” will be scheduled for deletion. Account owners will also be notified by email of “inactive” images that are scheduled for deletion.</p>
                    

                                

                    
          </div>                  <div>
          <h5>How can I get unlimited retention on my container images?</h5>
          <p>Image retention limits only apply to <strong>Free</strong> individual and organization accounts. Users with <strong>Pro</strong> or <strong>Team</strong> accounts are not subject to retention limits. If you have a <strong>Free</strong> account, you can easily upgrade to a <strong>Pro</strong> or <strong>Team</strong> account starting at $5 per month with an annual plan.

          <h5>Why is Docker introducing an “inactive” image policy?</h5>
          <div><p>As the world’s largest repository of container images, Docker Hub stores more than 15PB of data. After detailed analysis of the container images stored on Docker Hub, we found that 4.5PB of the data have not been pushed or pulled within 6 months or longer. We are making this move to optimize operations and make the Docker Hub service even stronger for developers and development teams around the world who are using the service to build and ship applications.
