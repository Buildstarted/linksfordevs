<p>GistPad is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to manage <a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub Gists</a> entirely within the editor. You can open, create, delete, fork, star and clone gists, and then seamlessly begin editing files as if they were local. It's like your very own developer library for building and referencing code snippets, commonly used config, programming-related notes/documentation, and <a href="#playgrounds" rel="noreferrer noopener">interactive samples</a>. Additionally, you can collaborate with your friends and colleagues by "following" them, so that you can access/browse/fork and comment on their gists, without ever leaving Visual Studio Code 🚀</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/69910156-96274b80-13fe-11ea-9be4-d801f4e9c377.gif" width="750px"></p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Install this extension from the marketplace and then reload VS Code</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Linux Users</strong>: Ensure you have the <code>gnome-keyring</code> and <code>libsecret</code> packages installed as well. These will enable GistPad to read/write your GitHub auth token securely.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GitHub Enterprise users</strong>: Set the <code>gistpad.apiUrl</code> setting to point at the API URL of your GitHub server instance (e.g. <code>https://[YOUR_HOST]/api/v3</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Open the <code>GistPad</code> tab <em>(look for the notebook icon in the activity bar)</em>. From there, you can open a Gist by ID/URL, or sign-in in with a GitHub token, in order to view/edit/create/delete/fork/clone your own gists. To sign-in, you can generate an auth token by visiting <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this page</a>, giving the token a name (e.g. <code>gistpad</code>), and ensuring to check the <code>gist</code> checkbox.</p>
<img width="300px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/69827991-d56f5580-11ce-11ea-9081-17f27b470fd1.png">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Git+HTTPS Users</strong>: If you've already signed-in to <code>github.com</code> with the <code>git</code> CLI, GistPad will attempt to provide "single-sign on", assuming you're using HTTPS-based auth, and your login session includes the <code>gist</code> scope <em>(SSH-based auth isn't supported)</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Create new gist by clicking the <code>+</code> icon in the <code>Gists</code> toolbar and specifying the files to seed it with (including support for <a href="#files-and-directories" rel="noreferrer noopener">directories</a>!). Additionally, you can create gists from local files or snippets, by right-clicking them in the <code>Explorer</code> tree, or right-clicking an editor window/tab, and selecting <code>Copy File to Gist</code>, <code>Add Selection to Gist</code> or <code>Paste Gist File Contents</code> (<a href="#contributed-commands-editor" rel="noreferrer noopener">details</a>)</p>
<img width="250px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/69903980-98819b00-1355-11ea-913b-c51981891bcd.png">
</li>
<li><p>View and reply to comments in a Gist by scrolling to the bottom of a Gist file and interacting with the thread (including embedded code snippets!)</p>
<img width="450px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/70117955-a9633280-161b-11ea-88a5-ac8a15a3b7a0.png">
</li>
<li><p>Stay up-to-date with your friend's and colleague's Gists by following them via the <code>GistPad: Follow User</code> command</p>
<img width="252" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/69890797-c03e1800-12ef-11ea-85be-7d6fe2c8c7ef.png">
</li>
<li><p>If you're working on a web app, and want to create <a href="#playgrounds" rel="noreferrer noopener">runnable code samples</a>, right-click the <code>Your Gists</code> node and select <code>New Playground</code> (or <code>New Secret Playground</code>. This will provide you with a live dev environment, to experiment with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, that is saved as a shareable gist</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="files-and-directories">Files and Directories</h2>
<p>When you create a gist via the <code>New Gist</code> (or <code>New Secret Gist</code>) command, you can specify a comma-seperated list of file names to seed the gist with. Furthermore, you could add <code>/</code> to your filenames, in order to add them to a sub-directory within the gist. For example, if you create a new gist, and specify <code>todos/personal.txt,todos/work.txt,reminders.txt</code>, the gist will include a <code>reminders.txt</code> file at the root of the gist, and <code>personal.txt</code> and <code>reminders.txt</code> files within a new directory called <code>todos</code>.</p>
<p><img width="200px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/74593846-7b6b7880-4fe4-11ea-9bf8-722bf7887ef1.png"></p><p>At any time, you can add new files to a gist or directory by right-clicking them and selecting <code>Add New File(s)</code> or <code>Upload File(s)</code>. You can also rename/delete directories as well, by right-clicking them in the tree and selecting the appropriate command. If you'd like to move a file from one directory to another, simply right-click the file, select <code>Rename File</code> and edit the directory name that it's in. It's that simple!</p>

<p>Gist comments are exposed within the editor at the bottom of any opened Gist files. If a Gist includes multiple files, then the comment thread will be displayed at the bottom of them all (duplicated and synchronized).</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/70118599-42467d80-161d-11ea-85eb-7f4cc6e4006b.gif" width="700px"></p><p>If you're not authenticated, you can view existing comments, but you can't reply to them. If you are authenticated, you can add/reply, as well as edit/delete your own comments. In order to control the behavior of how Gist comment threads are displayed, refer to the <code>GistPad &gt; Comments: Show Thread</code> config setting.</p>
<h2 id="pasting-images">Pasting Images</h2>
<p>In order to make it easy to author markdown and HTML/Pug files that include image assets, you can copy images into your clipboard (e.g. taking a screenshot, clicking <code>Copy Image</code> in your browser, etc.) and then paste them directly into a gist file by right-clicking the editor and selecting <code>Paste Image</code>, or using one of the following keyboard shortcuts: <code>ctrl + shift + v</code> <em>(Windows/Linux)</em>,<code>cmd + shift + v</code> <em>(macOS)</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1478800/70382701-9a7ac980-1914-11ea-9fb0-6e55424e2e54.gif" alt="paste-image"></p>
<p>By default, when you paste an image into a Gist file, it's uploaded as a <code>.png</code> to the gist, and the appropriate reference is added to it from the document (e.g. inserting an <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code>). However, this behavior can be changed by using the <code>GistPad &gt; Images: Paste Format</code> and/or <code>GistPad &gt; Images: Paste Type</code> settings. Refer to the <a href="#configuration-settings" rel="noreferrer noopener">config settings</a> section below for more details.</p>
<p>By default, when you paste an image, it is uploaded to a directory called <code>images</code> within the gist. However, if you'd like to change this (e.g. to <code>assets</code> instead), you can set the <code>GistPad &gt; Images: Directory Name</code> setting.</p>
<h2 id="following-users">Following Users</h2>
<p>GitHub Gists already allows you to star other user's gists, and when you do that, those will appear in the <code>Gists</code> tree, underneath a <code>Starred Gists</code> node. However, if you want to follow a GitHub user, and easily browse all of their current and future gists (without having to star each one!), you can run the <code>GistPad: Follow User</code> command and specify their GitHub user name. Once you've done that, you'll see a new node in the <code>Gists</code> tree which displays all of their public gists, and allows you to open/fork/clone/star them just like any other gist.</p>
<p><img width="252" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/69890797-c03e1800-12ef-11ea-85be-7d6fe2c8c7ef.png"></p><h2 id="interactive-playgrounds">Interactive Playgrounds</h2>
<p>If you're building web applications, and want to create a quick playground environment in order to experiment with HTML, CSS or JavaScript (or <a href="#additional-language-support" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sass/SCSS, Less, Pug and TypeScript</a>), you can right-click the <code>Your Gists</code> node and select <code>New Playground</code> or <code>New Secret Playground</code>. This will create a new gist, seeded with an HTML, CSS and JavaScript file, and then provide you with a live preview Webview, so that you can iterate on the code and visually see how it behaves.</p>
<p>When you create a new playground, you'll be asked to select a template, which is simply a way to get started quickly, using the libraries and languages you intend to use (e.g. React.js, Vue.js). You can also choose not to use a template, which will simply create a new playground, with an empty HTML, CSS and JavaScript file, which you can then <a href="#external-libraries" rel="noreferrer noopener">add libraries</a> to as neccessary.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/72381586-79a05380-36cc-11ea-824e-38f9afec136b.gif" alt="Playground"></p>
<p>Since the playground is backed by a Gist, your changes are saved and shareable with your friends. Additionally, as you find other playgrounds that you'd like to use, simply fork them and create your own playgrounds. That way, you can use Gists as "templates" for playground environments, and collaborate on them with others just like you would any other gist. When you're done with a playground, simply close the preview window and all other documents will be automatically closed. If you no longer need the playground, then delete it just like any other gist 👍</p>
<h3 id="toolbar">Toolbar</h3>
<p>When you open a playground, this activates the "playground toolbar", which is a collection of helpful utilities that are displayed in the editor's title bar. The following describes the available actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run Playground</strong> - Re-runs the HTML, JavaScript and CSS of your playground. This can be useful when wanting to reset a playground's state and/or if you've disabled the auto-run behavior for playgrounds.</li>
<li><strong>Open Console</strong> - Opens the <code>GistPad Playground</code> console, which allows you to view the output of any <code>console.log</code> calls that your playground makes (<a href="#console-output" rel="noreferrer noopener">details</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Change Layout</strong> - Allows you to change the layout configuration of the playground editors (<a href="#layout" rel="noreferrer noopener">details</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Add Library</strong> - Allows you to add an external library to your playground (e.g. React.js, Font-Awesome) (<a href="#external-libraries" rel="noreferrer noopener">details</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Open Playground Developer Tools</strong> - Opens the Chrome Dev Tools for your playground preview, which lets you use the DOM exlporer, evaluate JavaScript expressions in the console, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img width="464" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71629353-eafee300-2bb1-11ea-88f0-0996ab6149c4.png"></p><h3 id="uploading-images">Uploading Images</h3>
<p>You can reference HTTP-based images within any of your playground files, and they'll be downloaded/rendered automatically. However, if you need to add local images to your playground, you can upload them in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Right-click the gist in the <code>Gists</code> view and select <code>Upload Files(s)</code>. This supports any file type, and therefore is the most general-purpose solution. Once the image is uploaded, you can then reference it from your playground using only its filename (e.g. <code>&lt;img src="myImage.png" /&gt;</code>), since the playground preview understands the context of the "surrounding gist".</p>
</li>
<li><p>Copy/paste an image into your clipboard, open up an HTML or Pug file, right-click the editor and select <code>Paste Image</code>. This will transparently upload the image to the gist, and then insert a reference to it for you (e.g. adding an <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code> tag). This solution works best when you want to paste a "transient" image into your playground, such as a captured screenshot, or an image that you copied from a webpage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="additional-language-support">Additional Language Support</h3>
<p>By default, new playgrounds create an HTML, CSS and JavaScript file. However, if you're more productive using a different markup, stylesheet or scripting language, then simply rename the respective files to use the right extension, and the code will be automatically compiled for you on the fly! Specifically, GistPad supports the following languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SCSS/Sass</strong> - Rename the <code>style.css</code> file to <code>style.scss</code> or <code>style.sass</code>. *Note: While VS Code ships with language support for SCSS out-of-the-box, it doesn't ship support for Sass (the "indentended" syntax). So if you plan to author playgrounds with that syntax, it's recommended that you install <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Syler.sass-indented" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this extension</a> along with GistPad.</li>
<li><strong>Less</strong> - Rename the <code>style.css</code> file to <code>style.less</code></li>
<li><strong>Markdown</strong> - Rename the <code>index.html</code> file to <code>index.md</code></li>
<li><strong>Pug</strong> - Rename the <code>index.html</code> file to <code>index.pug</code></li>
<li><strong>TypeScript</strong> - Rename the <code>script.js</code> file to <code>script.ts</code> (or <code>script.tsx</code>, in order to use JSX in your code)</li>
<li><strong>JSX</strong> - Rename the <code>script.js</code> file to <code>script.jsx</code> in order to enable JSX to be written in "vanilla" JavaScript files. Additionally, if you add the <a href="#external-libraries" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>react</code> library</a> to your gist's <code>playground.json</code> file, then <code>*.js</code> files can also include JSX.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you'd like to always use one of these languages, then set one or more of the following settings, and all new playgrounds will include the right files by default: <code>GistPad &gt; Playgrounds: Markup Language</code>, <code>GistPad &gt; Playgrounds: Script Language</code>, <code>GistPad &gt; Playgrounds: Stylesheet Language</code>. View the <a href="#configuration-settings" rel="noreferrer noopener">settings documentation</a> below for more detials.</p>
<h3 id="external-libraries">External Libraries</h3>
<p>If you need to add any external JavaScript libraries (e.g. <code>react</code>) or stylesheets (e.g. <code>font-awesome</code>) to your playground, simply click the <code>Add Playground Library</code> commmand in the playground "action bar" (or run <code>GistPad: Add Playground Library</code> from the command palette). This will allow you to search for a library from CDNJS or paste a custom library URL. When you select a library, it will be automatically added to your playground.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71629251-4ed4dc00-2bb1-11ea-9488-78c3d71dbacd.gif" alt="Add Library"></p>
<p>Behind the scenes, this command update the playground's manifest file (<code>playground.json</code>), which you can also open/edit yourself manually if you'd prefer. Additionally, since Gist files provide an internet-accessible URL, you can use Gists as re-usable snippets for playgrounds, and add references to them by right-clicking a gist file in the <code>Gists</code> tree, select <code>Copy GitHub URL</code>, and then adding it as a library reference to the appropriate playground.</p>
<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>
<p>By default, when you create a playground, it will open in a "Split Left" layout, which vertically stacks the code editors on the left, and allows the preview window to occupy the fully IDE height on the right. However, if you want to change the layout, you can run the <code>GistPad: Change Playout Layout</code> command and select <code>Grid</code>, <code>Preview</code>, <code>Split Bottom</code>, <code>Split Right</code>, or <code>Split Top</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71560396-5152fc80-2a1e-11ea-9cff-a9590e1ea779.gif" alt="Layout"></p>
<p>Additionally, if you create a playground, that looks best in a specific layout, you can set the <code>layout</code> property in the playground's <code>playground.json</code> file to either: <code>grid</code>, <code>preview</code>, <code>splitLeft</code>, <code>splitLeftTabbed</code>, <code>splitRight</code>, <code>splitRightTabbed</code> or <code>splitTop</code>. Then, when you or someone else opens this playground, it will be opened with the specified layout, as opposed to the user's configured default layout.</p>
<h3 id="console-output">Console Output</h3>
<p>The playground also provides an output window in order to view any logs written via the <code>console.log</code> API. You can bring up the output window, as well as run the playground or open the Chrome Developer Tools, by clicking the respective command icon in the editor toolbar. If you'd like to always open the console when creating/opening playgrounds, you can set the <code>GistPad &gt; Playgrounds: Show Console</code> setting to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p><img width="503" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71384593-0a38b780-2597-11ea-8bba-73f784f6ec76.png"></p><p>Additionally, if you create a playground that depends on the console, you can set the <code>showConsole</code> property in the playground's <code>playground.json</code> file to <code>true</code>. Then, when you or someone else opens this playground, the console will be automatically opened, regardless whether the end-user has configured it to show by default.</p>
<h3 id="readme">Readme</h3>
<p>If you'd like to give your playground an introduction, you can create a file in the playground called <code>README.md</code> (or <code>README.markdown</code>), and by default, it's contents will be rendered above the playground code in the preview window. When a playground is opened, the <code>README.md</code> file isn't opened, which allows the playground to be focused on the core code assets (e.g. <code>index.html</code>, <code>script.js</code>), and allow the preview window to include embedded documentation.</p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>By default, playground's assume you're using "standard" JavaScript code (<code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" /&gt;</code>), and allows you to add 3rd-party <a href="#external-libraries" rel="noreferrer noopener">libraries</a>, which are added via new <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements in the preview page. However, if you'd like to write JavaScript code using <code>import</code>/<code>export</code>, you can set the <code>scriptType</code> property to <code>module</code> in the playground's <code>playground.json</code> file, and then begin to <code>import</code> modules. To simplify the process of importing 3rd-party modules, we'd recommend using either <a href="https://unpkg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unkpkg</a> (adding the <a href="https://unpkg.com/#query-params" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>?module</code> parameter</a> to any URLs), or the <a href="https://www.pika.dev/cdn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pika CDN</a>.</p>
<h3 id="temporary-playgrounds">Temporary Playgrounds</h3>
<p>If you'd like to create a playground, without persisting it as a gist, you can create a "temporary playground" by selecting the <code>Don't create gist</code> button on the playground creation form (as opposed to giving it a description). You'll be able to edit, add, delete, and rename files just like a normal gist, but the changes are only kept in memory, and therefore, represent a great solution for exploring ideas quickly, and then moving on.</p>
<p><img width="600px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/74090056-40a19780-4a5c-11ea-896b-dfbb03e7f7d6.png"></p><p>Note that temporary gists don't appear in the main <code>Gists</code> explorer tree, and therefore, to manage files within a temporary gist, you need to use the <code>Active Gist</code> tree on the <code>GistPad</code> tab.</p>
<h3 id="gist-links">Gist Links</h3>
<p>If you'd like to add a link in your gist/readme, which references a file and/or line/column within a file in the gist, simply add a hyperlink, whose <code>href</code> value uses the <code>gist:</code> scheme (kind of like a <code>mailto:</code>), and specifies the file name you'd like to open (e.g. <code>gist:index.html</code>). Optionally, you can specify a line and column number as well (e.g. <code>gist:index.html@23:5</code>), which allows you to highlight a specific line/span of code when the end-user clicks on it.</p>
<h3 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h3>
<p>By default, a playground represents a single interactive sample. However, they can also represent multi-step tutorials/presentations, by making two simple changes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Specifying a tutorial title, by setting the <code>tutorial</code> property in the playground's <code>playground.json</code> file</p>
</li>
<li><p>Defining a series of steps as gist <a href="#files-and-directories" rel="noreferrer noopener">directories</a>, whose name starts with the step number and includes an optional description (e.g. <code>1</code>, <code>1 - Discussion of text</code>, <code>#1 - Intro</code>). The contents of the directory match that of a standard playground (e.g. an <code>index.html</code>, <code>script.js</code> file, etc.), and it's encouraged that each step have a <a href="#readme" rel="noreferrer noopener">readme</a> that includes instructions. The number of steps in the tutorial is determined by the number of directories in the gist that follow the aforementioned pattern.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When a user opens up a tutorial playground, they'll only see the contents of the current step, and the preview window will include a navigation header that allows moving forward and backwards in the tutorial. Additionally, the user's current step will be persisted so that they can take a tutorial and pick up where they left off when they re-open the tutorial. To try an example, view the <a href="https://gist.github.com/lostintangent/c3bcd4bff4a13b2e1b3fc4a26332e2b6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learning MobX Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/74594741-8d521900-4fee-11ea-97ac-1fdfac132724.gif" alt="MobX"></p>
<h3 id="template-galleries">Template Galleries</h3>
<p>When you create a new playground, you'll see a list of templates, which let you create playgrounds using a pre-defined set of files and external libraries (e.g. React.js, Vue). This makes it really easy to get started quickly, and reduce repetitive tasks/boilerplate. By default, GistPad includes a standard set of templates, which come from two built-in galleries: <code>web:languages</code> and <code>web:libraries</code>. If you don't intend to use one or both of these, you can disable them by clicking the gear icon when running the <code>New Playground</code> (or <code>New Secret Playground</code>) command, and de-selecting the galleries you don't want. Additionally, you can modify the <code>GistPad &gt; Playgrounds: Template Galleries</code> setting.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, a template gallery is simply a JSON file, which is hosted somewhere (e.g. a gist, a git repo, your own web server), and defines a set of templates. A template is simply a gist, which includes the neccessary files (e.g. HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.), and then defines a name and description. To see an example of how to define a template gallery, see the built-in <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lostintangent/ece303a6b8c7cbf0293b850b600e3cb6/raw/gallery.jsonn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>web:libraries</code> gallery</a>. Additionally, to see an example of a template, see the <a href="https://gist.github.com/lostintangent/f15a2e498523f364e36075691542af4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">React.js template</a>.</p>
<p>When defining the template, you can use the <code>playground.json</code> file to indicate not only the JavaScript and CSS libraries that the playgroud needs, but also, the <a href="#layout" rel="noreferrer noopener">layout</a> it should use by default, and whether or not the console should be automatically opened (e.g. because the playground relies on writing console logs). See <a href="#playground-metadata" rel="noreferrer noopener">the docs</a> for more details on this file.</p>
<h3 id="user-templates">User Templates</h3>
<p>In addition to using/creating template galleries, you can also mark your own local playgrounds gists as being templates, by simply setting <code>"template": true</code> in the playground's <code>playground.json</code> file. Then, when you create a new playground, you'll see your template in the list. This option is good for defining your own templates, that you don't intend to share with others.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you star a gist that is marked as a playground template, that will show up in the list of templates as well. That way, you can easily share templates with others, without needing to create a template gallery.</p>
<h3 id="playground-metadata">Playground Metadata</h3>
<p>Whenever you create a playground, it includes a <code>playground.json</code> file, which defines the metadata for the playground, including it's behavior, requirements and intended presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>scripts</code> - An array of URLs that indicate the JavaScript libraries which should be added to the playground when run. This property can be managed via the <code>Add Library</code> command in the <a href="#toolbar" rel="noreferrer noopener">playground toolbar</a>, and therefore, it isn't neccesary to manually edit it. Defaults to <code>[]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>styles</code> - An array of URLs that indicate the CSS libraries which should be added to the playground when run. This property can be managed via the <code>Add Library</code> command in the <a href="#toolbar" rel="noreferrer noopener">playground toolbar</a>, and therefore, it isn't neccesary to manually edit it. Defaults to <code>[]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>showConsole</code> - Specifies whether to automatically open the <a href="#console-output" rel="noreferrer noopener">console</a> when someone opens this playground. Note that this will take precendence over the user's configure console setting, and therefore, is useful when a playground relies on console output, and can ensure the playground is setup correctly without requiring the end-user to explicitly open the console.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>layout</code> - Specifies the <a href="#layout" rel="noreferrer noopener">layout</a> to use when someone opens this playground. Note that this will take precedence over the user's configured default layout, and therefore, is useful when a playground is optimized for a specific layout, and therefore, can ensure the end-user has the best experience by default.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>scriptType</code> - Indicates the value of <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element's <code>type</code> attribute, when injected into the playground preview page. Can either be <code>text/javascript</code> or <code>module</code>. Defaults to <code>text/javascript</code>.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li><p><code>template</code> - Indicates that this playground is intended to be used as a template for new playgrounds, and therefore, will appear in the list when creating a new playground. Defaults to <code>false</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="codepen">CodePen</h3>
<p>If you export a pen to a <a href="https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/#save-as-github-gist-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub Gist</a>, and then refresh the <code>Gists</code> tree in VS Code, you'll be able to see the pen and then can open/edit it like any other playground. This allows you to easily fork someone's pen and work on it within VS Code.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71393589-171ed080-25c2-11ea-8138-ba075daf7d37.gif" alt="CodePen"></p>
<p>Additionally, if you develop a playground locally, and want to export it to CodePen (e.g. in order to share it with the community), you can right-click the gist and select <code>Export to CodePen</code>. This allows you to develop within VS Code, and then share it when you're done. When a playground is exported to CodePen, it's tagged with <code>gistpad</code> so that the community can <a href="https://aka.ms/gistpad-codepen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see</a> the pens being created with it.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71533903-39f60100-28b0-11ea-9e16-891a110c7074.gif" alt="Export"></p>
<h3 id="blocks">Blocks</h3>
<p><a href="https://bl.ocks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bl.ocks</a> is community for sharing interactive code samples/data visualizations, which are based on GitHub Gists. As a result, you can copy the URL for any Block, use it to open a gist within GistPad, and immediately have an interactive environment for viewing/exploring the Block.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can create new blocks with GistPad by adding the optional <code>Blocks</code> gallery, and then creating a new playground using one of the block templates. From there you can edit HTML, use the included D3 library, upload data files (e.g. JSON, CSV, TSV) and watch the preview update in real-time. If you'd like to view/share the playground, you can right-click the gist and select <code>View Gist in Bl.ocks</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/73127896-28217f80-3f7c-11ea-99a6-e7ab0be0aabf.gif" alt="blocks"></p>
<h2 id="gistlog">GistLog</h2>
<p>In addition to being able to use Gists to share code snippets/files, you can also use it as a mini-blog, thanks to integration with <a href="https://gistlog.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GistLog</a>. In order to start blogging, simply run the <code>GistPad: New GistLog</code> command, which will create a new Gist that includes two files: <code>blog.md</code> and <code>gistlog.yml</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/70856110-fdc3a900-1e8a-11ea-8e26-2c3917e11db0.gif" alt="GistLog"></p>
<p>The <code>blog.md</code> file will be automatically opened for editing, and as soon as you're ready to publish your post, open <code>gistlog.yml</code> and set the <code>published</code> property to <code>true</code>. Then, right-click your Gist and select the <code>Open Gist in GistLog</code> menu. This will open your browser to the URL that you can share with others, in order to read your new post.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to view individual posts on GistLog, you can also open your entire feed by right-clicking the <code>Your Gists</code> tree node and selecting the <code>Open Feed in GistLog</code> menu item. This will launch your GistLog landing page that displays are published GistLog posts.</p>
<h2 id="contributed-commands-file-explorer">Contributed Commands (File Explorer)</h2>
<p>In addition to the <code>Gists</code> view, GistPad also contributes an <code>Copy File to Gist</code> command to the context menu of the <code>Explorer</code> file tree, which allows you to easily add local files to a new or existing Gist.</p>
<p><img width="260px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/69831695-58001100-11df-11ea-997e-fc8020556348.png"></p><h2 id="contributed-commands-editor">Contributed Commands (Editor)</h2>

<h2 id="recommended-extensions">Recommended Extensions</h2>
<p>In order to improve the productivity of editing Gists, and make VS Code behave similarly to the GitHub.com experience, the following extensions are recommended, depending on how you expect to use Gists (e.g. markdown files, code snippets):</p>
