					<p>We are excited to announce two new online resources for developers using Windows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A new docs landing-page for developers building and deploying apps and systems running on non-Microsoft operating systems like Linux and Android</li>
<li>A new GitHub issues repo for filing developer-oriented issues with Windows</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s dig into these two announcements:</p>

<p>Are you a developer using Windows, but working with cross-platform web, Node, React, Java, Kotlin, Python, Xamarin, Android Studio, etc.? And do you primarily deploy your sites, services, and systems to Linux-based cloud environments or Android devices?</p>
<p><img src="https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2020/07/2adfc5797586390b6ab274bc643aaaf1.png" alt="Set up your Windows 10 development environment screen." width="270" height="500" srcset="https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2020/07/2adfc5797586390b6ab274bc643aaaf1.png 270w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2020/07/2adfc5797586390b6ab274bc643aaaf1-162x300.png 162w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px"></p>
<p>If so, we’re very excited to announce that we’ve just published a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/overview">new landing-page</a> to help you get your development environment setup and optimize your workflow when running Windows.</p>
<p>We want you, and every developer running on Windows, to have an enjoyable and productive experience, regardless of your preferred developer tools, languages, runtimes or target platforms.</p>
<p>This new landing page contains guidance and resources to help you learn how Windows can work for you, and how you can use all of your most loved open-source tools, alongside Microsoft apps and tools like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, Visual Studio, VSCode, etc.</p>
<p>If you’re new to using or developing on Windows, we have your back. We know that switching to an unfamiliar platform/environment can impact your productivity until you get comfortable, so this new landing-page will also contain guidance to help you map your Linux / Mac behaviors (e.g. keyboard shortcuts) to Windows.</p>
<p>We have also shared some of the latest relevant advancements and improvements in Windows including features like Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Windows Terminal, Windows Package Manager (WinGet), and PowerToys. Combining these great new tools and many other Windows 10 features with your favorite developer tools, languages, runtimes, and platforms will help you get more done, more easily and quickly than ever before. Be sure to head over to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/overview">the new landing page</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>We’re “starting simple” with this first version of the landing page, but we’re keen to adapt the page and its contents based on your feedback, so please be sure to let us know what you’d like to see added/changed on the page and linked resources:</p>
<p>Use the links at the bottom of the page to submit comments, or even contribute content edits via GitHub PRs, and we’ll do our best to keep the page’s content fresh, relevant, and useful.</p>

<p>Have you, as a developer, ever uncovered issues when using or running your code on Windows, and wished that you could share the issue with the Windows engineering team?</p>
<p>Now you can!</p>

<p>Welcome to the new <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windev">”WinDev” GitHub repo</a>!</p>
<p>We created this repo to enable developers who use Windows to submit &amp; discuss issues directly to Windows engineering teams who don’t already have a repo of their own, whether the issues you uncover are to do with using Windows itself, or running your code on Windows!</p>
<p><strong>Important caveat</strong>: This is a new communications channel for our team and so we are starting small by only accepting developer-related performance issues at this time. As we learn more about how to best handle these issues, we aim to broaden the scope of this repo to include additional scenarios.</p>
<p>Please review <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windev/">the repo’s ReadMe page</a> regularly, as we will be updating the page with the latest news, updates, and requests for specific feedback.</p>
