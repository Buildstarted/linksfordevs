<h2 id="preamblenotapart2">Preamble - not a part 2</h2>

<p>A little while ago <a href="https://blog.marcgravell.com/2019/02/fun-with-spiral-of-death.html">I blogged here</a> and I set it up to be a "continues..." style post. I haven't had the energy to continue it in that context, and this fact was putting me off concluding the post. I then realised: the thing that matters isn't some overarching narrative structure, but that I get my ideas down. So: I'm aborting any attempt at making this post a continuation, and just focusing on the content!</p>



<p>There's been a lot of confusion over when to use <code>Task[&lt;T&gt;]</code> vs <code>ValueTask[&lt;T&gt;]</code> (note: I'm going to drop the <code>[&lt;T&gt;]</code> from now on; just pretend they're there when you see <code>Task</code> / <code>ValueTask</code> etc).</p>

<h2 id="contextwhataretaskandvaluetask">Context: what are <code>Task</code> and <code>ValueTask</code>?</h2>

<p>In case you don't know, <code>Task</code> and <code>ValueTask</code> are the two primary implementations of "awaitable" types in .NET; "awaitable" here means that there is a duck-typed signature that allows the compiler to turn this:</p>

<pre><code>int i = await obj.SomeMethodAsync();
</code></pre>

<p>into <em>something like</em> this:</p>

<pre><code>var awaiter = obj.SomeMethodAsync().GetAwaiter();
if (!awaiter.IsCompleted)
{
    // voodoo here that schedules a
    // continuation that resumes here
    // once the result becomes available
}
int i = awaiter.GetResult();
</code></pre>

<p><code>Task</code> is the original and most well known API, since it shipped with the TPL, but it means that an object allocation is necessary even for scenarios where it turns out that it <em>was</em> already available, i.e. <code>awaiter.IsCompleted</code> returned <code>true</code>. The <code>ValueTask</code> value-type (<code>struct</code>) acts as a hybrid result that can represent an already completed result <em>without allocating</em> <strong>or</strong> an incomplete pending operation. You <em>can</em> implement your own custom awaitables, but it isn't common.</p>

<h2 id="whentochooseeachtheincorrectversion">When to choose each, the incorrect version</h2>

<p>If you'd asked me a while back about when to choose each, I might have <strong>incorrectly</strong> said something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>Task</code> when something is usually or always going to be genuinely asynchronous, i.e. not immediately complete; use <code>ValueTask</code> when something is usually or always going to be synchronous, i.e. the value will be known inline; also use <code>ValueTask</code> in a polymorphic scenario (<code>virtual</code>, <code>interface</code>) where you can't know the answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The logic behind this incorrect statement is that if something is incomplete, your <code>ValueTask</code> is going to end up being backed by a <code>Task</code> <em>anyway</em>, but without the extra indirection and false promise of <code>ValueTask</code>. This is incorrect, though, because it is based on the premise that a <code>ValueTask</code> is a composite of "known result (<code>T</code>)" and "<code>Task</code>". In fact, <code>ValueTask</code> is <em>also</em> a composite of a third thing: <code>IValueTaskSource[&lt;T&gt;]</code>.</p>

<h2>What is <code>IValueTaskSource[&lt;T&gt;]</code>?</h2>

<p><code>IValueTaskSource</code> is an abstraction that allows you to represent the <em>logical</em> behaviour of a task <strong>separately</strong> to the result itself. That's a little vague, so an example:</p>

<pre><code>IValueTaskSource&lt;int&gt; someSource = // ...
short token = // ...
var vt = new ValueTask&lt;int&gt;(someSource, token);
// ...
int i = await vt;
</code></pre>

<p>This now functions like you'd expect from an awaitable, but <strong>even in the incomplete/asynchronous case</strong> the logic about how everything works is now down to <em>whatever implements the interface</em> - it <strong>does not</strong> need to be backed by a <code>Task</code>. You might be thinking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ah, but we still need an instance of whatever is implementing the interface, and we're treating it as a reference, so: we're still going to allocate; what's the point? what have you gained?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that's when I need to point out the <code>short token</code>. This little gem allows us to use the <strong>same interface instance</strong> with <strong>multiple</strong> value-tasks, and have them know the difference. There are two ways you <em>could</em> use this:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep the state for multiple asynchronous operations <em>concurrently</em>, using the <code>token</code> to pick the correct state (presumably from a vector)</li>

<li>keep a <em>single</em> piece of state for multiple <strong>consecutive</strong> operations, using the <code>token</code> to guarantee that we're talking about the correct one</li>
</ul>

<p>The second is actually <em>by far</em> the more common implementation, and in fact is now included in the BCL for you to make direct use of - see <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/Threading/Tasks/Sources/ManualResetValueTaskSourceCore.cs"><code>ManualResetValueTaskSourceCore&lt;T&gt;</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="sowhathowdoesthishelpme">So what? How does this help me?</h2>

<p>OK; so - we've seen that this alternative exists. There are two ways that people commonly author awaitable APIs today:</p>

<ul>
<li>using <code>TaskCompletionSource&lt;T&gt;</code> and handing the caller the <code>.Task</code> (perhaps wrapped in a <code>ValueTask</code>), and calling <code>TrySetResult</code> etc when we want to trigger completion</li>

<li>using <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>, having the compiler generate all the machinery behind the scenes - noting that this currently involves creating a <code>Task</code> in the incomplete case, even for <code>ValueTask</code> methods (because it has to come from <em>somewhere</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully you can see that <strong>if we have <code>ValueTask</code> available to us</strong> it is relatively easy to substitute in a <code>ManualResetValueTaskSourceCore</code> backer, allowing us to <strong>reuse</strong> the same <code>IValueTaskSource</code> instance multiple times, avoiding <strong>lots</strong> of allocations. But: there's an important caveat - <strong>it changes the API</strong>. No, really. Let's take a stroll to discuss how...</p>



<p>Right now, the following code works - assuming the result is backed by either a fixed <code>T</code> or a <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var pending = obj.SomeMethodAsync();
int i = await pending;
// ...
int j = await pending;
</code></pre>

<p>You'll get the same answer from each <code>await</code>, unsurprisingly - but the actual operation (the method) is only performed once. But: if we switch to <code>ManualResetValueTaskSourceCore</code>, we should only assume that each <code>token</code> is valid <strong>exactly once</strong>; once we've awaited the result, the <em>entire point</em> is that the backing implementation is free to re-use that <code>IValueTaskSource</code> <strong>with a different <code>token</code></strong> for <em>another consumer</em>. That means that the code shown above <em>is no longer legal</em>, and we should expect that the second <code>await</code> can now throw an exception about the <code>token</code> being incorrect.</p>

<p>This is a pretty rare thing to see in code, so personally I'm OK with saying "tough; await once only". Think of it in human terms; this is like a manager going to someone's desk and saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi, I need the answer to (some topical question); do you know that now? if so, tell me now; otherwise, when you have the answer, bring it (somewhere) and nudge me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All fine and reasonable so far; our office hero didn't know the answer right away, so they went away and got it, took it where instructed and handed the answer to the manager.</p>

<p>20 minutes later (or 2 days later), the manager stops by their desk again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, give me that answer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, our hero might reasonably say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boss, I already gave it you; I only printed it out once - you have the copy; I deal with lots of requests each day, and I can't even remember what you <em>asked about</em>, let alone what the answer was; if you've forgotten the answer, <em>that's on you</em> - feel free to ask again, it's all billable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is kinda how I anthropomorphize <code>ValueTask</code>, especially in the context of <code>IValueTaskSource</code>. So key point: <strong>don't await twice</strong>. Treat the results of <em>awaitables</em> exactly the same as you would the result of <em>any other expression</em>: if you are going to need the value twice, store it in a local <em>when you first fetch it</em>.</p>



<p>So; we've seen how we can <em>manually</em> use an <code>IValueTaskSource</code> to efficiently issue <code>ValueTask</code> awaitable results; but if we use <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>, in the incomplete / asynchronous case the compiler is still going to be generating a <code>Task</code> - and also generating a bunch of other state boxes associated with the continuation voodoo. But.. <em>it doesn't have to!</em> A while ago I did some playing in this area that resulted in <a href="https://mgravell.github.io/PooledAwait/">"Pooled Await"</a>; I'm not going to go into details about this here, and for reasons that will become clear in a moment, I <strong>don't</strong> recommend switching to this, but the short version is: you can write a method that behaves <em>exactly like</em> a <code>ValueTask</code> awaitable method (including <code>async</code>), but the library makes the compiler generate different code that using <code>IValueTaskSource</code> to avoid the <code>Task</code> allocation, and uses state machine boxing to reduce the other allocations. It works pretty well, but as you might expect, it has the above caveat about awaiting things more than once</p>

<p>So; why am I saying don't leap at this? That because the BCL folks are <em>also</em> now playing in this space, as evidenced by <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/26310">this PR</a>, which has pretty much the exact same feature set, but the advantages of:</p>

<ul>
<li>being written by people who <em>really, really</em> understand async</li>

<li>it not adding any dependencies - it would just work <em>out of the box</em> for <code>ValueTask</code> awaitables</li>
</ul>

<p>If that happens, then a lot of  asynchronous code will magically get less allocatey <em>all at once</em>. I know this is something they've discussed in the past, so maybe my "Pooled Await" stuff gave them the metaphorical kick to go and take another look at implementing it for real; or maybe it was just a timing coincidence.</p>

<p>For both my own implementation and the BCL version, it can't do <em>all</em> the magic if you return <code>Task</code> - for best results, a <code>ValueTask</code> is needed (although "Pooled Await" still reuses the state-machine boxes for <code>Task</code> APIs)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, going back to the earlier question of when to use <code>Task</code> vs <code>ValueTask</code>, IMO the answer is now obvious:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>ValueTask[&lt;T&gt;]</code>, unless you absolutely can't because the existing API is <code>Task[&lt;T&gt;]</code>, and even then: <em>at least consider</em> an API break</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also keep in mind:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only <code>await</code> any single awaitable expression <strong>once</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we put those two things together, libraries and the BCL are free to work miracles in the background to improve performance <em>without the caller needing to care</em>.</p>
