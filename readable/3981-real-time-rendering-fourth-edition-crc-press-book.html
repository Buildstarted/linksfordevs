With the advent of programmable shaders, a wide variety of new algorithms have arisen and evolved over the past few years. This edition discusses current, practical rendering methods used in games and other applications. It also presents a solid theoretical framework and relevant mathematics for the field of interactive computer graphics, all in an approachable style. <b>New to this edition: </b>new chapter on VR and AR as well as expanded coverage of Visual Appearance, Advanced Shading, Global Illumination, and Curves and Curved Surfaces.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><li>Covers topics from essential mathematical foundations to advanced techniques used by today’s cutting edge games</li><li>Case studies are grounded in specific real-time rendering technologies</li><li>Revised and revamped for its updated fourth edition, which focuses on modern techniques and used to generate three-dimensional images in a fraction of time old processes took</li><li>Covers practical rendering for games to math and details for better interactive applications. </li><p>Reviews</p><p>"This is the book I recommend to everyone starting out in the industry. Not only is it a great reference on so many topics, each topic is covered in impressive depth with great references for further exploration." — Alex Vlachos, Valve</p><b><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">"</p><i>Real-Time Rendering</i><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;"> condenses literally thousands of cutting-edge papers, talks, and blogs into a single, easy-to-read volume presenting today's best practices, open problems, and promising state-of-the-art research. A key reference for beginners and experts!" — Chris Wyman, Principal Research Scientist, NVIDIA</p><b>　</b><p>"Since it was first published, <i>Real-Time Rendering</i> has been an invaluable companion to anyone who wants to keep up with this dynamic field. It combines rigorous coverage of the fundamentals with up-to-date discussion of the latest techniques. The fourth edition is required reading for anyone serious about computer graphics." — Matt Pharr, co-author of <i>Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation</i></p><b><p>"I built our rendering engine and my career on what I learned in previous editions of <i>Real-Time Rendering</i>. This new edition is carefully updated to represent the current state of our field, and will remain the first resource I check when tackling a new challenge." — Patrick Cozzi, Principal Graphics Architect, Cesium, and co-editor of <i>OpenGL Insights</i></p><b><p>"<i>Real-Time Rendering</i> is the first book I recommend reading to anyone who wants to learn real-time graphics. All the relevant knowledge in one place, and a joy to read, too!" — Aras Pranckevičius, Unity Technologies<b></b></p><b><p>About the Cover</p></b><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">: The cover shows an example of advanced real-time rendering technology used in the 2018 </p><i>Star Wars</i><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">™ short </p><i>Reflections</i><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">, which includes real-time ray tracing of reflections and area light shadows computed on the GPU.
