                Green card limits haven’t budged in decades, while new policies make it harder, costlier, and more uncertain for the world’s talent to come to the United States.

Without immigration reforms, this country’s days as the world’s <span class="caps">AI</span> leader may be&nbsp;numbered.</p><p>Foreign-born talent fuels the <span class="caps">U.S.</span><span class="caps">AI</span> sector at every level. Immigrants lead many of America’s top <span class="caps">AI</span> companies, contribute groundbreaking original research in machine learning and other emerging disciplines, and handle much of the essential, ongoing work to deploy and manage <span class="caps">AI</span> technologies. Immigrants comprise two-thirds of <span class="caps">U.S.</span> graduate students in <span class="caps">AI</span>-relevant fields and founded many of America’s most successful companies active in <span class="caps">AI</span>, including Google, Tesla, and chipmaker&nbsp;Nvidia.</p><p>America’s world-class universities, leading companies, and high quality of life continue to attract the world’s best and brightest in <span class="caps">AI</span>, but an inflexible and restrictive skilled immigration system increasingly stands in their way. Many of the biggest problems have existed for years, if not decades. For example, annual limits on employment-based green cards haven’t budged since 1990, even as the national economy has doubled in size. Other problems are newer. The White House has voiced support for “merit-based” immigration, but in practice, stringent new adjudication policies have made applying for skilled immigrant status a longer, costlier, and more uncertain process. Processing delays are getting worse, prompting <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/nativedocuments/Processing_Delays_-_Senator_Tillis.pdf">bipartisan concern</a> in Congress and contributing to application backlogs in the&nbsp;millions.</p><p>These problems are undermining America’s <span class="caps">AI</span> sector. Renowned machine learning scientist Ian Goodfellow recently <a href="https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/1095727254057840640">said</a> visa restrictions on his foreign collaborators have been “one of the largest bottlenecks to our collective research productivity over the past few years.” Oren Etzioni, <span class="caps">CEO</span> of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-trumps-executive-order-on-ai-is-missing/">warns</a> that “restrictive immigration policies are systematically depriving [American] universities of some of the world’s top talent.” <span class="caps">MIT</span> president Rafael Reif <a href="https://president.mit.edu/speeches-writing/immigration-kind-oxygen">described</a> similar trends as part of a “loud signal…that the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> is closing the door – that we no longer seek to be a magnet for the world’s most driven and creative individuals…[W]e should expect it to have serious long-term costs for the nation and for&nbsp;<span class="caps">MIT</span>.”</p><div class="d1-article-left-rail-subscribe-container"><p class="d1-article-sidebar-subscribe-title"><span class="d1-article-sidebar-subscribe-title-text">Subscribe</span></p><p class="d1-article-sidebar-subscribe-msg"><em>Receive daily email updates:</em></p><p class="d1-article-sidebar-subscribe-msg">Subscribe to the Defense One daily.</p><p class="d1-article-sidebar-subscribe-msg">Be the first to receive updates.</p></div><p>In the past, America might have been able to get by with flawed immigration laws: no matter the obstacles, <span class="caps">AI</span> talent would flock to the world’s unquestioned leader in science and innovation. But <a href="http://cdn.aiindex.org/2018/AI%20Index%202018%20Annual%20Report.pdf">times are changing</a>. Already, many of the world’s highest-valued <span class="caps">AI</span> startups are based outside the United States, and labs from Beijing to Bangalore are pursuing cutting-edge <span class="caps">AI</span> research. Meanwhile, other nations are <a href="https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en/knowledge/publications/15227e13/canada-launches-new-global-skills-strategy">overhauling</a> their own immigration laws and offering <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a06f414c-0e6e-11e9-a3aa-118c761d2745">generous</a><a href="https://medium.com/frenchtech/france-is-going-all-in-to-help-its-startups-win-the-battle-for-global-talent-enter-the-new-french-c33311bc8510">incentives</a> to immigrants with <span class="caps">AI</span> skills. In this competitive environment, <i>status quo</i> policy isn’t a viable&nbsp;option.</p><p>To maintain its advantage, the United States needs an efficient, accessible immigration system that welcomes the world’s <span class="caps">AI</span> talent. And that talent needs a clear and realistic path toward long-term legal status, since most who make the move want to remain in the United States. That means lifting outdated limits, overhauling restrictive regulations and agency policies, and making clear to the world – in rhetoric and in action – that America is open to talented <span class="caps">AI</span> workers, students, and entrepreneurs, no matter their&nbsp;origin.&nbsp;</p><p>Achieving these reforms will also require addressing two common&nbsp;concerns:&nbsp;</p><p>First, immigration is unlikely to crowd native-born <span class="caps">U.S.</span> citizens out of the <span class="caps">AI</span> sector. In fact, <span class="caps">AI</span> employers are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-artificialintelligence/as-companies-embrace-ai-its-a-job-seekers-market-idUSKCN1MP10D">hungry for talent</a> and are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-13/in-the-war-for-ai-talent-sky-high-salaries-are-the-weapons">hiring</a><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/tech-careers/where-the-engineering-jobs-are-in-2019">all</a> the qualified candidates they can find. State and federal policies to support U.S.-born <span class="caps">AI</span> talent are welcome—but they’ll take years or decades to bear fruit, and won’t meet the market’s huge demand on their own. And leaving immediate supply and demand aside, America will always have an interest in ensuring that talented individuals come to live, work, and fuel <span class="caps">AI</span> innovation in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>Second, the risks of theft or espionage don’t justify closing the country’s doors to foreign <span class="caps">AI</span> talent. To be sure, illicit technology transfer is a significant threat to the United States, and foreign visitors are sometimes to blame. But it’s <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2019/04/chinas-theft-espionage-what-must-be-done/">unclear</a> how well recent “extreme vetting” and screening policies can ferret out the small number of bad actors coming in from abroad. At the same time, these practices are making the immigration process slower, costlier, and less predictable, spreading fear and disillusionment among foreign <span class="caps">AI</span> students, workers and entrepreneurs. In turn, they make the United States less able to recruit the talent it needs to maintain leadership in artificial intelligence. That’s a serious national security threat in&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Immigration reform of any sort may be a tall order nowadays, but the dawn of the <span class="caps">AI</span> age is reason enough to redouble those efforts. Anyone interested in securing America’s advantage in artificial intelligence needs to work to open doors to talent from around the world. Otherwise, counterproductive immigration laws may make this country a second-rate <span class="caps">AI</span> power before&nbsp;long.<img class="tombstone" src="https://cdn.defenseone.com/b/defenseone/img/article-end.png"></p></div></div></div></div>
