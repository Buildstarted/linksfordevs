He has no freedom - no equity.</p><p>But, the man who makes $50K/year but works when, where and how they want to, is fully present with their family and doesn’t need to physically be on call to run his business is wealthy. He has a high equity business.&nbsp;</p><p>If you can’t make yourself unnecessary to the running of your own business you will never scale it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So why Revenue Stacking and Why Now?</strong></p><p>I am about to be a dad for the first time this summer. I don’t want to own a business that physically requires me to be somewhere to render services for the majority of my income.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I can’t trade time for dollars sustainably anymore.</p></blockquote><p>(<a href="https://medium.com/@cahillkicking/how-i-created-a-6-figure-coaching-business-by-accident-that-then-blew-up-in-my-face-and-so-can-7d471ffaba6c" target="_blank">Just see what happened the last time I went all in on trading time for dollars!</a>)&nbsp;</p><p>With COVID19 disrupting the sports industry and physical proximity limited it is time to diversify how I generate revenue. Were all my eggs in one basket relying on large training camps I would be dead in the water.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are my goals?</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>I want to make generating revenue as mindless as possible.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>I want to generate an average of $4,000~ a month.</p></li></ol><p>I broke my revenue streams into two camps: in-person revenue but low equity and digital revenue with high equity.&nbsp;</p><h3>In-Person Revenue (Low&nbsp;Equity)</h3><p><em>In-person means I need to physically be there to perform this product/service.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Don’t mind the +16k% it was the first time I used&nbsp;Stripe.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592006372025_14012"><div><p><strong>Revenue Stream #1: One-Off-Training 1,779.00</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>One-Off-Training means each session must be scheduled, booked and paid for every time you train.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Most of my clients have preferred this, but it is taxing mentally. There is about a 5 to 10 day lag time from first connecting with a client about a next session to when they pay for it.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>*Caution* This is a high lift, but low equity. I need to get away from this.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Revenue Stream #2: Subscriptions $1,000.00</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>I noticed about 20% of my clients trained religiously — once or twice a week even.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>I proposed trying a monthly subscription model for their training, which generated about $1,000 in expected revenue for me next month.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>While I am still physically tied to coaching on a field to render services I don’t need to cognitively spend time chasing clients to pay for their next batch of training.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>My wife also likes this since now we can see better what’s coming in next month (she’s my Chief Financial Officer)</p></li><li><p>*Caution* Be sure to fully inform clients when they are signing up for a subscription. Unexpected charges kill trust, fast. I like a 7 to 14 day notification that their next subscription payment is starting.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Revenue Stream #3: Time Blocks $1,000.00</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Some clients like to train for the long haul, in three to six month blocks of time.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Selling a training block of time is a great way to inject cash into your bank account fast, so in the short term it can give you a nice boost.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>This lighten the cognitive load again of needing to sell and resell one-off-training.</p></li><li><p>*Caution* Since this client is paying for your time upfront you won’t have them to rely upon the next few months for revenue. Give this larger injection of cash a job.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3>Digital Revenue (High&nbsp;Equity)</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592006372025_20531"><div><p><strong>Revenue Stream #1: Online Recruiting Course $299.98</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Using Google Docs, Slides, Loom Screen Recorder and Gumroad as a sales platform I created a course called <a href="https://gum.co/WicNo" target="_blank">How to Dominate College Football Recruiting on Twitter</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Making a digital product was much more work upfront, perhaps about 12 to 20 hours of creation time.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Unlike Squarespace, Gumroad lets you upload multiple digital files into one product page, which makes it a lot easier to make and sell courses on.</p></li><li><p>But once this course was created I didn’t need to physically be anywhere to render it as a service (victory!)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Revenue Stream #2: eBooks $0.00~</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Using Google Docs on Chrome’s Voice-To-Text feature, I was able to blast out a small 30–40 page eBook, <a href="https://gum.co/SiXSh" target="_blank">How To Kick Under Pressure</a>, in about 8 hrs, edit it, and turn it into a pdf download that I posted on Gumroad and on Amazon using Kindle Self Publisher.</p></li><li><p>Amazon probably has better reach, and as of now, it’s where the bulk of my sales have come from. But, they do take 65% or so of your revenue which is high.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Gumroad, on the other hand, has a very small processing fee, so you are left with about 90%+ of your revenue.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>I haven’t had great traction here, so far but as I move traffic over to Gumroad am hopeful it will pick up.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592006372025_27090"><div><p><strong>Revenue Stream #3: Blog &amp; Podcast Ads $45.00~</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>My podcast <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6Fy6ulBDtEYsHoNJOHBkyh" target="_blank"><em>The Coach Cahill Podcast</em></a> is hosted through the app Anchor. Anchor automatically monetizes your podcast for you, and how much you are paid depends on how large your audience is. Podcasts aren’t ways to get rich (unless you’re Joe Rogan) but they are a great way to build authority, an audience and an excuse to talk to people who would otherwise ignore you. When you stay consistent with it, you can start earn enough money to begin paying for some small business expenses:</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592006372025_33816"><div><h3><strong>Where were the surprises?</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The more options you provide your following to do business with you the greater your chances of building a more diverse revenue stream.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Even just reducing sales lag-time by implementing time block and subscription services has made aspects of my business already more sustainable.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a href="https://gumroad.com/invite/brendancahill" target="_blank">Gumroad</a> is a powerful tool that gives you a much greater ROI on your products than Amazon might — especially if you have a very small niche audience like I do.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>I’ve got a lot of business assets that are both in-person and digital that I’ll need to think of a better way to organize and leverage.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The feeling of generating revenue from a digital product that you don’t have to physically render is amazing and I am going to put the bulk of my time now into expanding my digital assets.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3>Summary</h3><p><strong>In-Person Training: $3,779.00</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>$1,000 from subscriptions</p></li><li><p>$1,000 from time blocks</p></li><li><p>$1,778 from one-off-sales</p></li></ul><p><strong>Digital Products: $344.98</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>$299.98 from digital course</p></li><li><p>$0.00 from ebooks</p></li><li><p>$45.00 from podcast</p></li></ul><h3><em>Total for last four weeks: $4,123.98</em></h3><h3><strong>Last Thoughts</strong></h3><p>Revenue isn’t about earning money in a single moonshot or renting a Gulf Stream to make a hype YouTube video in front of. It’s about systematically making small bets on your business and adjusting to how your audience responds along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>If your business needs you to be somewhere to perform its service it isn’t scalable nor sustainable in the long term. But, even if aspects of your business require you to be somewhere you can take small steps to diversify how you generate your revenue to reduce the stress of running your business day to day.&nbsp;</p><p>I write about scaling your own brand, revenue stacking it and how I’m doing it along the way. <a href="https://twitter.com/brendancahill_" target="_blank">If you’d like, I’m most active on Twitter and would enjoy connecting there</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>
