But in case you don’t recall, the basic idea is: supposing we have a distribution of values of a type where we can meaningfully take an average; <strong>the “expected value” is the average value of a set of samples as the number of samples gets very large.</strong></p><p>A simple example is: what’s the expected value of rolling a standard, fair six-sided die? You could compute it empirically by rolling 6000d6 and dividing by 6000, but that would take a while.</p><hr><p><strong>Aside:</strong> Again, recall that in Dungeons and Dragons, XdY is “roll a fair Y-sided die X times and take the sum”.</p><hr><p>We could also compute this without doing any rolling; we’d expect that about 1000 of those rolls would be 1, 1000 would be 2, and so on.&nbsp; So we should add up (1000 + 2000 + … + 6000) / 6000, which is just (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6, which is 3.5. On <em>average</em> when you roll a fair six-sided die, you get 3.5.</p><p>We can then do variations on this scenario; what if the die is still fair, but the labels are not 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, but instead -9, -1, 0, 1, 3, 30?&nbsp; As I’m sure you can imagine, once again we can compute the expected value by just taking the average: (-9 – 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 30) / 6 = 4.</p><hr><p><strong>Aside:</strong>&nbsp;It’s a bit weird that the “expected value” of a distribution is a value that is not even in the support of the distribution; I’ve never once rolled a 3.5 on a d6.&nbsp;Beginners sometimes confuse the expected value with the mode: that is, the value that you’d expect to get <em>more often</em> than any other value. Remember, the expected value is just an <em>average;</em>&nbsp;it only makes sense in distributions where the sampled values can be averaged.</p><hr><p>What if the die isn’t fair? In that case we can compute a <em>weighted average</em>; the computation is the value of each side, multiplied by the weight of that side, sum that, and divide by the total weight. As we saw in a previous episode:</p><p><span><span>public</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>static</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>double</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>ExpectedValue</span><span>(<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; this</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>IDiscreteDistribution</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span>)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=&gt;</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>Support</span><span>()</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>.</span><span>Select</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>(</span><span>double</span><span>)</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>*</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>Weight</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>))</span><span>.</span><span>Sum</span><span>()</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>/</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>TotalWeight</span><span>();</span></span></p><p>And of course we could similarly define methods for discrete distributions of double and so on. Hopefully that is all clear.</p><p>The question I want to explore in the next few episodes requires us to make a small extension of the meaning of “expected value”:</p><ul><li>Suppose we have a distribution of outcomes <code>d</code>, in the form of an <code>IWeightedDistribution&lt;double&gt;</code></li><li>Suppose we have a function <code>f</code>&nbsp;from double to double which assigns a value to each outcome.</li><li>We wish to accurately and efficiently estimate the average value of <code>f(d.Sample())</code>&nbsp;as the number of samples becomes large.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Aside:</strong> If we had implemented <code>Select</code>&nbsp;on weighted distributions, that would be the same as the expected value of <code>d.Select(f)</code>— but we didn’t!</p><p><strong>Aside:</strong> We could be slightly more general and say that the distribution is on any <code>T</code>, and <code>f</code>&nbsp;is a function from <code>T</code>&nbsp;to double, but for simplicity’s sake we’ll stick to continuous, one-dimensional distributions in this series. At least for now.</p><hr><p>There’s an obvious and extremely concise solution; <em>if we want the average as the number of samples gets large, just compute the average of a large number of samples! </em>It’s like one line of code. Since we make no use of any weights, we can take any distribution:</p><p><span><span>public</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>static</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>double</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>ExpectedValue</span><span>(</span><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>this</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>IDistribution</span><span>&lt;</span><span>double</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span>,</span><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Func</span><span>&lt;</span><span>double</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>double</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>f</span><span>)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=&gt;</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>Samples</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>Take</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Select</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Average</span><span>();</span><br></span></p><p>In fact, we could make this even more general; we only need to get a number out of the function:</p><p><span><span>public</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>static</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>double</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>ExpectedValue</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;(</span><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>this</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>IDistribution</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span>,</span><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Func</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>double</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>f</span><span>)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=&gt;</span><br><span>&nbsp; </span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>Samples</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>Take</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Select</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Average</span><span>();</span><br></span></p><p>We could also make it more specific, for the common case where the function is an identity:</p><p><span><span>public</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>static</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>double</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>ExpectedValue</span><span>(<br></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; this</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>IDistribution</span><span>&lt;</span><span>double</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span>)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=&gt;</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>ExpectedValue</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>x</span><span>);</span></span></p><p>Let’s look at a couple of examples.

</pre><p>It looks like we’ve heavily biased these coins towards flipping tails; suppose we draw a coin from this mint; what is the average fairness of the coins we draw? We can just draw a thousand of them and take the average to get an estimate of the expected value:</p><p><span><span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>distribution</span><span>.</span><span>ExpectedValue</span><span>());</span></span></p><pre>0.28099740981762
</pre><p>That is, we expect that a coin drawn from this mint will come up heads about 28% of the time and tails 72% of the time, which conforms to our intuition that this mint produces coins that are heavily weighted towards tails.</p><p>Or, here’s an idea; remember the distribution we determined last time: the posterior distribution of fairness of a coin drawn from a Beta(5, 5) mint, flipped once, that turned up heads. On average, what is the fairness of such a coin? (Remember, this is the average given that we’ve discarded all the coins that came up tails on their first flip.)</p><p><span><span>var</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>prior</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Beta</span><span>.</span><span>Distribution</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>5</span><span>);</span><br><span>IWeightedDistribution</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Result</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>likelihood</span><span>(</span><span>double</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span>)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=&gt;</span><br><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Flip</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Result</span><span>&gt;</span><span>.</span><span>Distribution</span><span>(</span><span>Heads</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Tails</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span>);</span><br><span>var</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>posterior</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>prior</span><span>.</span><span>Posterior</span><span>(</span><span>likelihood</span><span>)(</span><span>Heads</span><span>);</span><br><span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>posterior</span><span>.</span><span>ExpectedValue</span><span>());</span></span></p><pre>0.55313807698807</pre><p>As we’d expect, if we draw a coin from this mint, flip it once, and it comes up heads, on average if we did this scenario a lot of times, the coins would be biased to about 55% heads to 45% tails.</p><p>So, once again we’ve implemented a powerful tool in a single line of code!
