<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-8e10cff1e1b0a10f0983"><div><blockquote><p>‚ÄúAnything a 6 year old with a smartphone can do isn‚Äôt going to be rewarded by the market.‚Äù-Cal Newport </p></blockquote><p>I took my social media apps off of my cell phone this month. I just got sick of having the world in my pocket - especially with the birth of my first son, Hudson. <br></p><p>I fell into the fallacy that I <em>needed</em> to be on these platforms to build my audience  or generate leads. But, that‚Äôs only partially true. Objectively, the bulk of my business is referral but I was spending the bulk of my time on social media with skimpy returns. <br></p><p>Social media isn‚Äôt neutral. It is a slot machine. You‚Äôre gambling. These companies employ attention analysts from Las Vegas casinos to maximize time on screen. <br></p><p>Moreover, social media presence <em>isn‚Äôt </em>crucial to being rewarded in the economy. Focus, and creativity is. Yet these apps fragment and atomize our attention so much throughout the day it is difficult to stay on task for long. <br></p><p>Now, do you need to wipe your accounts? Not necessarily. I only said delete your apps, not your accounts. I still use social media, just on my laptop though. <br></p><p>By raising my own barrier to entry into social media I‚Äôve found myself less likely to social media graze like a mindless content cow üêÆ. <br></p><p>Here are a few heuristics going forward you might consider regarding your own social media use:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>What exactly are you using it for? If it is just for likes it‚Äôs probably not worth the compulsive use. If it is for generating occasional leads and keeping a record of your work, then decide how much time that takes. For me, it‚Äôs about 5-10min a day. <br></p></li><li><p>Where do you want to be? You‚Äôre not Gary V who is ‚Äúcrushing it‚Äù on every platform. Remember, he picked one platform, YouTube, and dominated that for years before he branches out to other ones. Seth Godin, arguably one of the greatest marketing figures today, only has a simple blog and email and doesn‚Äôt use any social media. <br></p></li><li><p>These companies aren‚Äôt neutral. You are their product not their client. A dairy farmer care little about the happiness of their cows compared to the volume of milk they produce. You, to your social media app icon on your phone, are just a content cow whose data is to be milked. <br></p></li></ol><p>Social media is great for ephemeral connection and the occasional lead, but that‚Äôs about it. Anything beyond that ventures into the realm of addiction. <br></p><p>Bren</p></div></div></div></div>
