If that number is impressively large, then it's fine.</p></blockquote><p>The <strong>birthday bound</strong> is often used to calculate this. If you crypto, you must have heard of something like this:</p><blockquote><p>with the SHA-256 hash function, you need to generate at least 2<sup>128</sup> hashes in order to have more than 50% chance of finding collisions.</p></blockquote><p>And you know that usually, you can just divide the exponent of your domain space by two to find out how much output you need to generate to reach such a collision.</p><p>Now, this figure is a bit <strong>deceiving</strong> when it comes to <strong>real world cryptography</strong>. This is because we probably don't want to define "<strong>OK, this is bad</strong>" as someone reaching the point of having 50% chance of finding a collision. Rather, we want to say:</p><blockquote><p>someone reaching <strong>one in a billion</strong> chance (or something much lower) to find a collision would be bad.</p></blockquote><p>In addition, what does it mean for us? How many identifiers are we going to generate per second? How much time are we willing to keep this thing secure?</p><p>To truly answer this question, one needs to plug in the correct numbers and play with the birthday bound formula. Since this is not the first time I had to do this, I thought to myself "why don't I create an app for this?" and <a href="https://www.davidwong.fr/whatsmybirthday">voila</a>.</p><p><img alt="birthday bound" src="/upload/Screen_Shot_2019-09-20_at_10.50_.46_PM_.png"></p><p><a href="https://www.davidwong.fr/whatsmybirthday">You can play with it here</a>.</p><p>Thanks to my tool, I can now answer Mesut's question:</p><blockquote><p>If you generate one million identifiers per second, in 26 years you will have one in a billion chance to generate a collision. Is this enough?
If this is not adversary-controlled, or it is rate-limited, you will probably not generate millions of identifiers per second though, but rather thousands, in this case it will take 265 centuries to get these odds.</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div>
