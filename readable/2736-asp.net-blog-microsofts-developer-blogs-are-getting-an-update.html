This week, you’ll see the Visual Studio, IoTDev, and Premier Developer blogs move to a new URL &nbsp;– while additional developer blogs will transition over the coming weeks. You’ll continue to receive all the information and news from our teams, including access to all past posts. Your RSS feeds will continue to seamlessly deliver posts and any of your bookmarked links will re-direct to the new URL location.</p><h2>We’d love your feedback</h2><p>Our most inspirational ideas have come from this community and we want to make sure our developer blogs are exactly what you need.
