And while the devices we use every day open the door for families to explore, learn and play together online, they can also bring a new set of worries for parents. Over the past two years, we've helped families across the globe set digital ground rules with the <a href="http://google.com/familylink">Family Link</a> app: A tool that offers parents a way to create and supervise Google Accounts for their kids, manage the content they see online and the amount of time spent on their devices. <br></p><h3>Available on every Android device</h3><p>Today at Google I/O, we announced we’ll be making Family Link part of every Android device, starting with <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-q-io">Android Q</a>. This means that Family Link will be accessible from device settings, making setup even smoother for families. Look for it under the setting “Digital Wellbeing and parental controls” in Android Q devices rolling out later this summer.</p><h3>App-specific time limits and bonus screen time</h3><p>We’re also giving parents the ability to set app-specific time limits, Since not all screen time is created equal, parents will soon be able to set app-specific time limits to help kids make better choices about how they’re spending time on their device. And while parents love that they can set a bedtime or daily screen time limit, sometimes kids just need a few more minutes to finish up what they’re doing on their devices. Soon, parents will be able to give kids bonus screen time directly from their own device.</p></div></div></div></div>
