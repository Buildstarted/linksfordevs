            Future graphics and imaging applicationsï¿½from photorealistic real-time rendering, to 4D light field cameras and pervasive sensing, to multi-material 3D printingï¿½demand orders of magnitude more computation than we currently have. The efficiency and performance of an application are determined by the algorithm and the hardware architecture on which it runs, but critically also by the organization of computations and data. Real graphics and imaging applications have complex dependencies, and are limited by locality (the distance over which data has to move, e.g., from nearby caches or far away main memory) and synchronization. Increasingly, the cost of communicationï¿½both within a chip and over a networkï¿½dominates computation and power consumption, and limits the gains realized from shrinking transistors.  This talk will focus on the Halide language and compiler for image processing. Halide explicitly separates what computations define an algorithm from the choices of execution structure which determine parallelism, locality, memory footprint, and synchronization. For image processing algorithms with the same complexityï¿½even the exact same set of arithmetic operations and dataï¿½executing on the same hardware, the order and granularity of execution and placement of data can easily change performance by an order of magnitude because of locality and parallelism. I will show that, for data-parallel pipelines common in graphics, imaging, and other data-intensive applications, the organization of computations and data for a given algorithm is constrained by a fundamental tension between parallelism, locality, and redundant computation of shared values. I will present a systematic model of
