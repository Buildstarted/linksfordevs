Only the tweet-status-id is needed.</p><p>For example, the following URLs will all show the same tweet because they contain the same tweet status ID, which in this case is&nbsp;1087839317534363648.</p><p>https://www.twitter.com/davy/status/1087839317534363648<br>https://www.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1087839317534363648<br>https://www.twitter.com/bleepincomputer/status/1087839317534363648</p><p>This behavior opens the door to abuse as users could be tricked into thinking that a Twitter user is promoting a particular tweet and its content. This could lead to the spread of disinformation or malicious content as the user clicking on the Tweet thinks it is from a trusted source.</p><h2>Misdirection through redirection</h2><p>As Twitter does not care what name is listed in a tweet and only cares about the ID, bad actors can modify tweets to make it appear as if someone is promoting the tweet and content that it redirects to.</p><p>Security researcher Davy Wybiral offered a sample of this deception by posting a link purportedly from President Donald Trump, which redirected to an older tweet from the researcher.</p><p>This leaves room to well-crafted social engineering&nbsp;that can easily direct&nbsp;to content from an attacker.&nbsp;</p><p>While on desktop browsers the redirect is more visible in the&nbsp;address bar, a deception of this sort can be refined to make it more difficult to detect by a potential victim.</p><p><img alt="Demonstrating Twitter URL Abuse" height="488" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" width="884" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/social-sites/twitter/twitter-url-abuse/tweet-abuse.gif" class="b-lazy"></p><p>The trick is even more powerful on mobile devices, where the redirect is completely hidden because the tweet opens in the Twitter client.</p><p>Using this method, disinformation campaigns can make it look like a political figure, such as President Trump, endorses a particular view by adding his account name to a tweet.</p><p>It can even be taken further as Twitter has no restrictions regarding the profile name, an individual with loose moral principles could easily impersonate a Twitter account and use the redirect behavior to point users to shady messages.</p><p>To get a better understanding of the risk, BleepingComputer created this shoddy proof-of-concept&nbsp;[<a href="http://twitter.com/NSAGov/status/1139201495856025605" target="_blank">twitter.com/<strong>NSAGov</strong>/status/<strong>1139201495856025605</strong></a>] that has the username of the National Security Agency in the link, but the status ID from an account we control.</p><div class="cat_queue"><p>Opening the link on a desktop computer reveals some clues about the fake account but they may be overlooked if it had&nbsp;a similar name as the impersonated account.</p><p><img alt="" height="500" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" width="951" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1100723/Twitter-redirect-desktop-view.png" class="b-lazy"></p><p>For the purposes of the demonstration, we temporarily changed the profile name and added images to make it look like the account belonged to the NSA.</p><p>At the end of the redirect can be anything from false information to links pointing to malware, phishing or other types of scams.</p><p>Launching the same link on a mobile phone, though, shows little indication that it is a ploy and there are high chances for the trickery to pass unnoticed.</p></div><p><img alt="" height="500" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" width="443" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1100723/Screenshot_20190613-190623.png" class="b-lazy"></p><p>This redirect manipulation issue is not new. The earliest report we found is <a href="http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/05/interesting-twitter-hashbang-bug/" target="_blank">from 2012</a>, from Terence Eden, who also offered the info in an answer on Stack Overflow in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27836043/get-tweet-url-having-only-tweet-id/39822226" target="_blank">early January 2015</a>. It was also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5652136/url-for-a-link-to-twitter-for-a-specific-tweet/37555814#37555814" target="_blank">suggested in 2016</a> as a solution&nbsp;for retrieving links to specific tweets. And it was <a href="https://www.bram.us/2017/11/22/accessing-a-tweet-using-only-its-id-and-without-the-twitter-api/" target="_blank">reported&nbsp;again in 2017</a>&nbsp;by freelance developer&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/bramus" target="_blank">Bram Van Damme</a>.</p><h2>Ripe for abuse</h2><p>Every communication platform is fertile ground for spreading information, even false news.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook is the typical choice for <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/facebook-bans-israeli-entity-for-creating-fake-accounts/" target="_blank">organizations</a> engaged in shaping distorted opinions of the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/facebook-removes-campaigns-used-to-sow-discord-in-uk-and-romania/" target="_blank">political</a>, social, or cultural reality.&nbsp;Twitter is no stranger to this, either. Just yesterday, researchers at Recorded Future shared their work on identifying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/fishwrap-influence-operation/" target="_blank">influence operations</a> on social media.</p><p>Today, Twitter also announced that it <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/information-ops-on-twitter.html" target="_blank">removed almost 5,000 fake accounts</a> registered for&nbsp;state-backed activities. This is just a drop in a bucket that has been filling for quite some time with fake accounts that generated over 30 million tweets and published more than one terabyte of media files.</p><p>Wybiral&nbsp;told BleepingComputer that one method to abuse Twitter is to start using handles of accounts that are no longer active.&nbsp;This works because Twitter allows changing the account username, anyone can pick one that was&nbsp;abandoned. A username that was also referenced in the past by a reputable source that is still available has a greater chance to pass the legitimacy test.</p><p>"So a clever troll can scrape the web for account links that aren't active anymore and start using their handle.&nbsp;If they need proof that they're a real person and not a troll... They can cite the older reference to the account," the researcher told us.</p></div></div></div></div>
