						<p>clickbait isn’t it? But this was Brock’s immediate reaction when we saw (and I recommend you read this first):</p>
<blockquote data-secret="tgyieZGdei"><p><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/">Full Third-Party Cookie Blocking and More</a></p></blockquote>

<p>What this basically means is, that browser are getting more and more strict with how they handle their cookies. The reasons are security (see the recent SameSite changes) and in this case – privacy. Cookies have been exploited for a long time one way or the other – and this is now the reaction of browser vendors.</p>
<p>What does that mean to application architectures? Well – first of all – all these changes <strong>only affect cross-site scenarios</strong>. But if you are in that situation the immediate consequences will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>front-channel logout notifications do not work anymore (used in pretty much every authentication protocol – like SAML, WS-Fed and OpenID Connect)</li>
<li>the OpenID Connect JavaScript session notifications don’t working anymore</li>
<li>the “silent renew” technique that was recommended so far to give your application session bound token refreshing don’t work anymore</li>
</ul>
<p>Safari and Brave are the first browser implementing those changes. Chrome will follow in 2022 (hopefully sooner) etc…</p>
<p>Some things can be fixed, e.g. you can replace front-channel notifications with back-channel ones. Some people recommend replacing silent renew with refresh tokens. This is dangerous advice – even if your token service has implemented <a href="https://leastprivilege.com/2020/01/21/hardening-refresh-tokens/">countermeasures</a>.</p>
<p>If all the security concerns around storing tokens in browsers did not worry you so far, maybe this is a good reason to consider the <a href="https://leastprivilege.com/2019/01/18/an-alternative-way-to-secure-spas-with-asp-net-core-openid-connect-oauth-2-0-and-proxykit/">BFF</a> architecture for your SPAs (if you are looking for less fancy name – it’s what the BCP calls “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps-05#section-6.2">JavaScript Applications with a back-end</a>“).</p>
<p>So are SPAs dead? Well – SPAs as in the UI/UX concept certainly not. SPAs as in “browser-based standalone applications that do cross-site authentication and API calls in the context of a modern identity and SSO architectures” – yes.</p>
<p>(and they should be unless we fix some fundamental problems)</p>
