        psychological blind spot in rational choice theory and ended up
        portraying psychology as the study of irrationality. In its portrayal,
        people have systematic cognitive biases that are not only as persistent
        as visual illusions but also costly in real life—meaning that
        governmental paternalism is called upon to steer people with the
        help of “nudges.” These biases have since attained the status of
        truisms. In contrast, I show that such a view of human nature is
        tainted by a “bias bias,” the tendency to spot biases even when there
        are none. This may occur by failing to notice when small sample
        statistics differ from large sample statistics, mistaking people’s random
        error for systematic error, or confusing intelligent inferences
        with logical errors. Unknown to most economists, much of psychological
        research reveals a different portrayal, where people appear
        to have largely fine-tuned intuitions about chance, frequency, and
        framing. A systematic review of the literature shows little evidence
        that the alleged biases are potentially costly in terms of less health,
        wealth, or happiness. Getting rid of the bias bias is a precondition
        for psychology to play a positive role in economics.</p><p><strong>DOI:</strong>10.1561/105.00000092</p></div></div></div></div>
