You might have noticed a few changes on the website recently. Chocolatey has grown up quite a lot since the initial design of the site and we wanted to bring a much more consistent look and feel. We looked out across the industry of websites for modern automation tools and were inspired to take a step back and a hard look at what we had. What we've come up highlights both our product and our amazing community, all on the same site!</p><p>The design is fresh, crisp, and brings many performance improvements to help you find the information you need, faster. Keep reading to learn about just a few of the key features you don't want to miss!</p><h3 id="where-did-everything-go">Where Did Everything Go?!</h3><p>Here is a handy list for you to get familiar with the website navigation:</p><ul><li><strong>Community Packages</strong> - From the top navigation click <strong>Community &gt; Community Packages</strong></li><li><strong>Documentation</strong> - To get to the Chocolatey Documentation, from the top navigation click <strong>Learn &gt; Docs</strong></li><li><strong>Contact</strong> - To get to the Contact area, from the top navigation click <strong>About &gt; Contact</strong></li><li><strong>Sitemap</strong> - For a quick guide to all important links on the Chocolatey website, visit our sitemap.
