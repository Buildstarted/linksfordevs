<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The modern HTTPS world has no place for old web servers</h2>

	<p><small>May 13, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>When I ran into <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/FirefoxOldTLSWarning">Firefox's interstitial warning for old TLS versions</a>, it wasn't where I expected, and where it
happened gave me some tangled feelings. I had expected to first run
into this on some ancient appliance or IPMI web interface (both of
which are famous for this sort of thing). Instead, it was on the
website of an active person that had been mentioned in a recent
comment here on <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a>. On the one hand, this
is a situation where they could have kept their web server up to
date. On the other hand, this demonstrates (and brings home) that
the modern HTTPS web actively requires you to keep your web server
up to date in a way that the HTTP web didn't. In the era of HTTP,
you could have set up a web server in 2000 and it could still be
running today, working perfectly well (even if it didn't support
the very latest shiny thing). This doesn't work for HTTPS, not today
and not in the future.</p>

<p>In practice there are a lot of things that have to be maintained on a
HTTPS server. First, you have to renew TLS certificates, or automate it
(in practice you've probably had to change how you get TLS certificates
several times). Even with automated renewals, Let's Encrypt has changed
their protocol once already, deprecating old clients and thus old
configurations, and will probably do that again someday. And now you
have to keep reasonably up to date with web server software, TLS
libraries, and TLS configurations on an ongoing basis, because I doubt
that the deprecation of everything before TLS 1.2 will be the last such
deprecation.</p>

<p>I can't help but feel that there is something lost with this. The
HTTPS web probably won't be a place where you can preserve old web
servers, for example, the way the HTTP web is. Today if you have
operating hardware you could run a HTTP web server from an old SGI
Irix workstation or even a DEC Ultrix machine, and every browser
would probably be happy to speak HTTP 1.0 or the like to it, even
though the server software probably hasn't been updated since the
1990s. That's not going to be possible on the HTTPS web, no matter
how meticulously you maintain old environments.</p>

<p>Another, more relevant side of this is that it's not going to be
possible for people with web servers to just let them sit. The more
the HTTPS world changes and requires you to change, the more your
HTTPS web server requires ongoing work. If you ignore it and skip
that work, what happens to your website is the interstitial warning
that I experienced and eventually it will stop being accepted by
browsers at all. I expect that this is going to drive more people
into the arms of large operations (like Github Pages or Cloudflare)
that will look after all of that for them, and a little bit more
of the indie 'anyone can do this' spirit of the old web will fade
away.</p>

<p>(At the same time this is necessary to keep HTTPS secure, and HTTPS
itself is necessary for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/ISPsAreThreats">the usual reasons</a>. But let's
not pretend that nothing is being lost in this shift.)</p>
