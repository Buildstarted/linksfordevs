    <h1>It&#x27;s Official: Open-Plan Offices Are Now the Dumbest Management Fad of All Time</h1>
    <div class="editableWrapper"><div><ol>	<li><em>Six Sigma,</em> where employees wear different colored belts (like in karate) to show they&apos;ve been trained in the methodology.</li>	<li><em>Stack Ranking,</em> where employees are encouraged to rat each other out in order to secure their own advancement and budget.</li>	<li><em>Consensus Management,</em> where all decisions must pass through multiple committees before being implemented.</li></ol></div><div><p>It need hardly be said that these fads were and are (at best) a waste of time and (at worst) a set of expensive distractions. But <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/hate-open-plan-offices-heres-whats-coming-next.html">open plan offices are worse</a>. Much worse. Why? B<span>ecause <em>they decrease rather than increase employee collaboration.</em></span></p></div><div><p>Instead, the opposite happens. They start using email and messaging with much greater frequency than before. In other words, even if collaboration were a great idea (<a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/collaboration-creates-mediocrity-not-excellence-according-to-science.html">it&apos;s a questionable notion</a>), <em><a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/open-plan-offices-create-extra-stress-for-women-say-scientists.html">open plan offices</a> are the worst possible way to make it happen.</em></p></div><div><p>Previous studies of <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/16-ways-open-plan-offices-make-you-less-productive.html">open plan offices</a> have shown that they make people less productive, but most of those studies gave lip service to the notion that open plan offices would increase collaboration, thereby offsetting the damage.</p></div><div><p>The Harvard study, by contrast, undercuts the entire premise that justifies the fad. And that leaves companies with only one justification for moving to an <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/why-your-company-will-benefit-from-getting-rid-of-open-office-spaces-first-90.html">open plan office</a>: less floor space, and therefore a lower rent.</p></div><div><p>But even that justification is idiotic because the financial cost of the loss in productivity will be much greater than the money saved in rent. Here&apos;s <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/hr/2016/open-office-plans-are-a-lot-less-cost-effective-than-you-may-think">an article where I do the math for you.</a>&#xA0;Even in high-rent districts, the savings have a negative ROI.</p></div><div><p>More important, though--if employees are going to be using email and messaging to communicate with co-workers, they might as well be <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/working-from-home-makes-you-happier-less-likely-to.html">working from home</a>, which costs the company nothing.</p></div><div><p>In fact, work-from-home actually saves money because then employees can live in areas where housing is more affordable, which means you can pay them a smaller salary than if you force them to live in, say, a high-rent district like Santa Clara, California.</p></div><div><p>So there it is. Companies have spent billions of dollars to create these supposedly-collaborative workplaces and the net effect has been for those same companies to suffer billions of dollars in&#xA0;lost&#xA0;productivity.</p></div><div><p>What can you do about it? Well, if you&apos;re a business owner, just say no, or, if you&apos;ve already drunk the Kool-Aid, admit you&apos;ve been snookered. Re-implement work-from-home and convert your open plan office into a collection of private spaces.</p></div><div><p>What if you&apos;re just a worker-bee? Well, tread lightly. As a general rule, bosses don&apos;t react well when told they&apos;ve made an expensive, dumb mistake. There are also some folk at your workplace whose careers are now tied to the &quot;success&quot; of the office redesign.</p></div><div><p>So, if you really want to try to change things,&#xA0;you&apos;ll need to deal with denial and cognitive dissonance. As&#xA0;Upton Sinclair might have said:&#xA0;&quot;It is difficult to get people&#xA0;to understand something, when their&#xA0;salary depends on their&#xA0;not understanding it.&quot;</p></div><div><p>If I were in that situation, I&apos;d use the overwhelming evidence against open plan offices to&#xA0;lobby for a more work-from-home so that the company can expand without adding office space. That&apos;s not only a good idea; it also allows the power-that-be to save face.</p></div></div>
