<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>May 19, 2020 - 14 min read</p><p>I’ve been using a set of Yubikeys for some time now, not just for 2FA but for
SSH authentication, remote code signing and password storage too. It’s worked
so well (and required such significant effort to get working) that I thought
I’d write about how I did it and what makes my approach secure.</p><p>GPG, or GnuPG – now in version 2.x implements the
<a href="https://www.openpgp.org/">OpenPGP</a> email encryption standard and allows the
use of hardware smartcards such as the Yubikey 5.</p><p>This guide is applicable to most Linux distribution and MacOS. I’m currently
using Ubuntu 20.04 and MacOS Mojave.</p><figure><a href="https://callanbryant.co.uk/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/yubikeys.cover.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a4ad2f29d1bfd599a830b16adbee23631849949b/dafd0/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/yubikeys.cover_hub5723e7ad27fc7d1f4d7b4f5981ba5ba_3453956_1280x720_fit_q75_lanczos.jpg" width="960" height="720" alt="My 3 yubikeys"></a><figcaption>My 3 yubikeys</figcaption></figure><p>A reference implementation of a system that supports this all automatically can
be found in <a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/">my dotfiles</a>.</p><h2 id="initialisation">Initialisation</h2><p>To start, you’ll need to install <code>ykman</code> and <code>gnupg</code> together with the right
interface software; <code>pcscd</code> and <code>scdaemon</code> on Ubuntu.</p><p>In order to use your Yubikey for everything in this article, it has to contain
the only copy of your GPG private keys; GPG must have the public parts and be
configured to use the Yubikey as an OpenPGP smartcard.</p><p>With OpenPGP/gnupg there are many different possible key topologies and crypto
settings. What you want will depend on what you need the configuration for.</p><h3 id="openpgp-setup">OpenPGP setup</h3><p>I recommend you follow this setup process in livecd session in order to
mitigate the risk of the private keys being intercepted by a bad actor before
they are copied to the yubikey.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>GnuPG2 classifies keys by their capability; you’ll notice (some of) the
characters <code>[CSEA]</code> alongside listed secret keys with GnuPG2. Whilst
fundamentally the private keys are just a number of bits, GnuPG2 can earmark
each key with one or more capabilities upon generation such that it can only
ever be used for the allocated purpose thereafter. The key capabilities are:
<code>[C]ertificaiton</code>, <code>[S]igning</code>, <code>[E]ncryption</code> and <code>[A]uthentication</code>.</p><p>As I understand, it is simply good cryptographic practice to have
single-purpose keys; you should not, for instance, use the same key to
authenticate as you should to encrypt. The reasoning behind this is presumably
to mitigate some kind of theoretical attack.</p><p>GnuPG2 historically has in interface designed for (unusual) humans, not
machines; until recently it was difficult to script. Since version 2.2, there
is an interface to generate and set up keys in non-interactive mode. As such I
created a script called
<a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/gpg-keygen">gpg-keygen</a>
to generate the following topology for you:</p><ol><li>One master key (<code>CS</code>) (4096 bit RSA)</li><li><code>S</code> subkey (4096 bit RSA)</li><li><code>E</code> subkey (4096 bit RSA)</li><li><code>A</code> subkey (4096 bit RSA)</li></ol><p>To use it, run the script in an empty directory. The master key has a longer
validity and can be used to revoke compromised keys<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> as well as create new,
certified subkeys. Store it encrypted (with all the other generated files) on a
flash drive in a physical safe a with a backup copy in another safe; it’s
sensitive.</p><figure><a href="https://callanbryant.co.uk/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/gpg-keygen.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/819b906979383fc3c3ee29679423c767842ac7e5/e44de/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/gpg-keygen.png" width="558" height="485" alt="Output of gpg-keygen"></a><figcaption>Output of gpg-keygen</figcaption></figure><p>The remaining 3 keys are for signing, encryption and authentication
respectively. They are as big as a Yubikey 5 will allow, and are of the RSA
type as the Yubikey 5 does not support eliptic curves.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p><figure><a href="https://callanbryant.co.uk/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/files-output.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fae8136c2207c1f960cf69639969c6dbf0091f96/2d9e8/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/files-output.png" width="345" height="270" alt="Files generated by gpg-keygen"></a><figcaption>Files generated by gpg-keygen</figcaption></figure><p>Next, you’ll need to copy the contents of <code>gnupghome</code> to <code>~/.gnupg</code> – on the
live session. GnuPG2 should then be able to load and use the keys, though
before use the private subkeys need to be moved to the Yubikey.</p><p>Now is a good time to change the default OpenPGP user and admin pin from
<code>123456</code> and <code>123435678</code> respectively. Steps:</p><ol><li>Run <code>gpg2 --card-edit &lt;email&gt;</code></li><li>Enter <code>admin</code></li><li>Enter <code>passwd</code> – change PIN and admin PIN as prompted</li></ol><p>To move the keys, use <code>gpg --edit-key &lt;email&gt;</code> and enter the following
commands:</p><ol><li><code>toggle</code></li><li>For each key (<code>S</code>,<code>E</code>,<code>A</code>) select one by toggling the asterisk one at a
time with the <strong>key</strong> command (1,2,3 respectively)</li><li>When a key is selected, run <code>keytocard</code> to copy the key to the
correct slot on the yuibkey (there are 3, one each for S,E,A)</li><li><code>save</code> then exit. If you don’t save, the private keys will persist
locally which defeats the purpose of using the yubikey.</li></ol><p>The private keys are now on your yubikey, and no longer exist in <code>~/.gnupg</code>.
The next step is to harvest the public parts of the key to initialise your
target machine.</p><p>In order to use your new identity on the target machine, you’ll need to import
the public keys and give the master key “ultimate trust.” This might sound odd,
but this means GPG will implicitly trust any sub-key certified by your master
key so you can use them.</p><p>I prefer a clean-room approach in this case to ensure that not private keys are
copied to the target machine; in addition it makes it clear what steps are
necessary to set up new machines, too. Bear in mind that if you use the
web-of-trust and intend to keep other peoples public keys in GnuPG, you’ll need
to transfer them separately.</p><p>To make GPG trust your master key ultimately, you’ll need to use the
<code>trusted-key</code> setting in <code>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</code>. On the live session, you’ll
notice a file called <code>gpg-keyid.txt</code> which contains your master key ID<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. You can
append it to your GPG config file with this scriptable example from my
dotfiles,
<a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/user-configuration-naggie.sh#L39">user-configuration-naggie.sh</a>:</p><pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
trusted-key 9D37503A7DA6F9B6
EOF
</code></pre><p>Of course you should substitute my key ID for yours.</p><p>Next, you’ll need to import the public portions of your newly generated keys.
These can be found in <code>gpg-pubkeys.asc</code> on the live session in ASCII-guarded
format. It was exported by my <code>gpg-keygen</code> script using <code>gpg2 --export --armor &gt; gpg-pubkeys.asc</code>.
The keys can be piped into <code>gpg2 --quiet --import</code> – see
<a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/user-configuration-naggie.sh#L43">https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/user-configuration-naggie.sh#L43</a> for reference.</p><p>Finally, tt’s important to install a <a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.gnupg/gpg.conf">hardened
gpg.conf</a>
to <code>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</code>. GnuPG2, by default, will use some relatively weak
ciphers presumably for the sake of compatibility.</p><figure><a href="https://callanbryant.co.uk/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/gpg-list-secret-keys.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5d406a02f9836d699e9ba5714912a814aca7e445/1dba8/blog/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-yubikey-with-gpg/gpg-list-secret-keys.png" width="522" height="316" alt="The resulting key topology loaded into GnuPG2.

passwords into chat or the terminal all the time). <code>ykpersonalise</code> can do
this, but can become locked out as it relies on OTP mode. To disable OTP
mode: <code>ykman mode FIDO+CCID</code>.</p><p>It’s important to enable touch-to-everything; this is a fundamental concept –
malicious programs are incapable of physically pressing a button.</p><ol><li><code>ykman openpgp touch enc on</code> – decrypting passwords will now require a touch</li><li><code>ykman openpgp touch aut on</code> – after this you’ll have to touch the yubikey to use SSH</li><li><code>ykman openpgp touch sig on</code> – signing commits will now require a touch</li></ol><h2 id="ssh-authentication">SSH authentication</h2><p>There are now actually three ways of using your Yubikey to authenticate to an
OpenSSH server:</p><ol><li>Using it as an OpenPGP Smartcard with gnupg2 as an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-agent">SSH-agent</a> (covered here)</li><li><a href="https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Guides/SSH_with_PIV_and_PKCS11.html">Using it in PIV
mode</a><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li><li>Using it as a U2F device with <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.2">OpenSSH 8.2+</a></li></ol><p>In terms of convenience, if you control the server U2F mode might be the best;
certainly the least expensive as U2F devices are prolific. Using the PIV mode
is a good option of you don’t want to mess with GPG.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p><p>In order to use option (1), after setting up GnuPG as per the previous section you’ll have to:</p><ol><li>Export your <code>authentication</code> public key in SSH format. You can do this with
<code>gpg2 --export-ssh-key &lt;email&gt;</code> and copy it to <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on
your remote machines as normal.</li><li>Configure your environment to use GnuPG2 as an SSH agent (only locally,
overriding system agent)</li></ol><p>To set up GPG as an ssh agent, I recommend use of the following function in
your <code>.bashrc/</code> or <code>.zshrc</code>. It can even be set as a <code>precmd</code> hook to
automatically update the environment – see the section on Tmux below.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>function</span> _update_agents <span>{</span>
    <span># take over SSH keychain (with gpg-agent soon) but only on local machine, not remote ssh machine</span>

    <span>fi</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>This function overrides the system SSH agent and replaces it with a GPG agent
– <em>but only if the current session isn’t a remote one</em> in order to make sure
agent forwarding is not clobbered. Running any GnuPG2 command will start a
daemonised agent if one is not running.</p><p>As described in the comments, there’s also a bit of code to automatically
recover an hung agent; unfortunately this is necessary to recover from dead
sockets that happen time to time.</p><p>Note that GPG can ingest regular SSH keys into its own store with <code>ssh-add</code> –
assuming you’re running a GPG agent. However, these keys won’t end up on the
Yubikey.</p><h2 id="gpg-agent-forwarding">GPG agent forwarding</h2><p>If you’re developing on a remote machine, you’re probably familiar with
forwarding your SSH agent to allow the use of Git with local SSH credentials.
GPG is capable of a similar mechanism, allowing commits on a remote machine to
be signed using your local Yubikey. GPG uses a unix socket for the agent
connection, and a special restricted “extra”
socket for remote use. The <a href="https://wiki.gnupg.org/AgentForwarding">official
guide</a> suggests 2 methods, depending on
whether your version of OpenSSH supports unix socket forwarding or not. <em>Both
methods are flawed:</em></p><ol><li>The first method (recommended for OpenSSH older than 6.7) suggests using
<code>netcat</code> to forward the unix socket over a TCP socket. This is insecure,
because anyone else on the remote host could connect to the forwarded TCP
port and use your forwarded agent. This might be OK if you’re the only use
on a given server but it clearly isn’t generally.</li><li>OpenSSH 6.7 and above can forward unix sockets, so the next recommendation
is to do so natively. However, the location of the local and remote sockets
is dependent on the version of GPG, your OS, and your username. As such, a
common workaround is to inspect every remote host and add a configuration
to the SSH config per host. It also requires server configuration to delete
the stale remote socket automatically. Both are manual steps.</li></ol><p>Worse, if you use the remote machine locally too (I do for my workshop PC)
you’ll find that the stale socket can interfere with any local GPG agent.</p><h3 id="a-better-solution">A better solution</h3><p>My solution (after a fair bit of experimentation) was to create an SSH wrapper
that probes the remote host to discover the correct location of the socket
before killing any remote GPG agent and connecting the intended session.
Combined with a pre-command hook that wires up the correct SSH, GPG and X
sockets, the result is a seamless experience. See the section on tmux for more
information.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>function</span> gssh <span>{</span>

special remote socket is used, else the full local one. This allows chaining of
agent forwarding so you can still use your local GPG via a bastion host.</p><p>I call my wrapper <code>gssh</code> rather than wrapping the <code>ssh</code> command. Being separate
from the normal <code>ssh</code> command, it allow allows you to be mindful about when you
forward your mgent – forwarding your GPG agent carries similar risks to
forwarding your SSH agent – an administrator on the remote host could use your
local GPG agent to further mitigate the risk, enable touch settings on your
yubikey as documented below.</p><h3 id="configuration-for-code-signing">Configuration for code signing</h3><p>To enable code signing with Git + Github:</p><ol><li>Upload the output of <code>gpg --export --armor &lt;email&gt;</code> (your GPG public keys)
to <a href="https://github.com/settings/keys">https://github.com/settings/keys</a>.</li><li>Tell git which key to use: <code>git config --global user.signingkey &lt;email&gt;</code></li><li>Tell git to sign always: <code>git config --global commit.gpgsign true</code></li></ol><h2 id="password-management">Password management</h2><p>I use <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">the standard unix password manager</a>
which is compatible with GnuPG2 out of the box. It is powered by git so syncing
passwords is easy. I use
<a href="https://github.com/browserpass/browserpass-extension">browserpass</a> to reduce
the effort required when used with Firefox. Documentation is very good and
usage is straightforward, so I won’t detail the steps here.</p><p>My <a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> copy the passwords over to my
PCs when provisioning and synchronising – so long as my yubikey is connected,
even new PCs can clone and decrypt my password repository.</p><p>One piece of advice: make sure touch to decrypt is enabled, such that passwords
cannot be decrypted without your human approval. To do this, see the first
section on initialisation.</p><h2 id="seamless-tmux-integration">Seamless tmux integration</h2><p>When using <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> you’ll find that it’s
necessary to re-spawn existing shells in order to use SSH agent / X forwarding
when reconnecting. This is irritating, so I’ve written bash and ZSH <code>precmd</code>
hooks to take care of updating the environment transparently before every
command.</p><p><code>precmd</code> hooks allow the execution of shell commands immediately before each
interactive command is run. This gives us the opportunity to modify the
environment of the command to be run. Helpfully this means we can make sure the
GPG, SSH and X forwarding is set up always, regardless of how old a particular
tmux shell is.</p><p>Zsh has a <code>precmd</code> hook by default, bash does not – though it’s possible with
<a href="https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec">bash-preexec</a>.</p><p>To enable this behaviour, simply set <code>_update_agents</code> (defined above) to be
called by the <code>precmd</code> hook after a new function <code>_tmux_update_env</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">    <span>function</span> _tmux_update_env <span>{</span>

involved, but scripting it all as part of managing
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles">dotfiles</a> means it becomes
quick and easy.</p><p>Thanks to my <a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> I’m able to get a
new installation running and configured within 30 minutes unattended –
packages are installed, followed by system configuration and finally user
configuration. As part of user configuration, GPG is set up to use my identity
with the private keys on my Yubikey. See
<a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/user-configuration-naggie.sh#L44">user-configuration-naggie.sh</a>
to see how this is done.</p><p>Historically I had to set up a new or existing SSH/GPG identity after the
provisioning; this was a rather tedious step considering the number of servers
and services I have and use; as a compromise the SSH key could be moved on a
flash drive, but that’s not ideal. The solution is to automate the association
of the private keys on my Yubikey with their respective public keys within my
gnupg2 database.</p><p>I now have a convenient way of securely accessing secrets upon provisioning a
new host. Now, my dotfiles will detect my yubikey and initialise the following:</p><ul><li>My notes, a git repository in <code>~/notes</code> (I have a script to push/pull to prevent commit fatigue)</li><li>My task management database to <code>~/.dstask</code> (powered by <a href="https://github.com/naggie/dstask">dstask</a>)</li><li>My passwords to <code>~/.password-store</code> (using the <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">standard unix password manager</a> detailed above)</li></ul><hr><p>See also:
<a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/blob/master/etc/yubikey.md">yubikey.md</a> for
some older, more general notes on the uses of yubikeys. In addition, my
<a href="https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> repository implements all of
this automatically so can be used as a reference.</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>I’m not aware of a method to generate the private portion on the GPG keys
