<p>Wanting to move away from Google both because of privacy issues, and horrible apps, I was looking for suitable cloud storage provider alternatives.</p>



<p>After trying out all the major players in the cloud storage field, I decided to cast my vote for <a href="https://dropbox.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dropbox</a>.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll talk about why I chose Dropbox even though they don’t have a stellar reputation when it comes to privacy.</p>



<p>Let’s start with:</p>



<h2>Dropbox’s privacy practices</h2>



<p>If you search the web for privacy-friendly cloud storage services, Dropbox won’t make the list.</p>



<p>Even if it did by some miracle or probably biased reviews, it shouldn’t be anywhere in the top five.</p>



<p>Take this incident, for example:</p>



<p>Around 2017-18, Dropbox shared folder-level information of <strong>400,000</strong> users with researchers at Northwestern University.</p>



<p>Here’s an article by WIRED, reporting the issue:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dropbox-sharing-data-study-ethics/"><img data-attachment-id="505" data-permalink="https://hulry.com/dropbox-vs-others/wired-dropbox-privacy-article/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?fit=2070%2C1676&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2070,1676" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="wired-dropbox-privacy-article" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?fit=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?fit=580%2C470&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?resize=580%2C470&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="WIRED reported that Dropbox shared user information with researchers." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?resize=1024%2C829&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?resize=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?resize=768%2C622&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?resize=1536%2C1244&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?resize=2048%2C1658&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?resize=1200%2C972&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?resize=1980%2C1603&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?w=1740&amp;ssl=1 1740w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wired-dropbox-privacy-article.png?resize=580%2C470&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a><figcaption>WIRED reported that Dropbox shared user information with researchers.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In Dropbox’s defence, the data shared were anonymised before they reached Northwestern University.</p>



<p>However, that still doesn’t justify Dropbox’s action. When you’re paying <strong>$9.99</strong> every month for a service, you would want the service provider to respect your privacy.</p>



<p>Also:</p>



<p>This incident is only an issue which caught the public eye. There might be smaller regular privacy violations that go on within the company without surfacing to the public.</p>



<p>For hardcore privacy advocates, this will probably be the “goodbye forever” point with Dropbox.</p>



<p>However, I’m more of a balanced guy — I’m satisfied with the right mix of privacy and useful product features. The grey area, if you would like to call it.</p>



<p>That was the most crucial factor in my decision to go with Dropbox.</p>



<p>Now, what are these features that made me willing to sacrifice privacy?</p>



<h2>An amazing syncing mechanism</h2>



<p>Before I moved to Dropbox, I was on the cloud storage platform that most people are on right now — Google Drive.</p>



<p>Apart from growing privacy issues with Google, the Backup &amp; Sync macOS app for Google Drive is probably the worst cloud sync app that I’ve ever used.</p>



<p>The app randomly quit and never restarted on its own. To bring it back up, I had to open it at least 3–4 times before it finally started syncing again.</p>



<p>Before you say that it might be an issue on my laptop, I have seen this exact behaviour on three different MacBooks with different OS versions.</p>



<p>Not only that, but the app also kept freezing as well. Check out the screenshot below:</p>

<p>In the above screenshot, I could interact freely with other apps on the menu bar apart from the Backup &amp; Sync app. It froze and stayed frozen until I force stopped the app.</p>



<p>For a long time, I’ve heard praises about Dropbox’s revolutionary sync technology. </p>



<p>When I used it for the first time, I was blown away.</p>



<p>It is genuinely the best syncing mechanism I’ve seen.</p>



<p>The app syncs everything as soon as there are changes locally, and the sync is fast.</p>



<p>One of the selling point points of Dropbox’s sync is that it syncs only the differences for existing files.</p>



<p>In simple words, if you make changes to an existing file, Dropbox will only sync the difference between the file’s previous copy and the new one.</p>



<p>This is how Dropbox can provide faster sync for large files because you don’t need to reupload the entire file. </p>



<p>Other syncing apps like Google’s Backup &amp; Sync, or Mega, works most of the times flawlessly. However, sometimes, they break badly.</p>

<p>If you notice the screenshot above, you can see that I have already removed all my files except one from my Mega folder. However, the app’s sync didn’t trigger.</p>



<p>It still shows all files as added, and that I’m occupying 37MB of storage.</p>



<p>The PDF file visible on the screenshot is a welcome guide, which is undoubtedly not 37MB.</p>



<p>I thought this might be a network issue. So, I went over to the Mega web app, and surprisingly, all files were deleted except the welcome guide.</p>



<p>It was Mega’s macOS app that was out of sync.</p>



<p>I spent around 4–6 weeks evaluating Dropbox. During that time, Dropbox never broke. Not even once.</p>



<p>Apart from stable functionalities, Dropbox’s macOS menu bar app is gorgeous and functional.</p>

<p>Options like search, filter files by sharing status, and more, make the app pleasing to use.</p>



<p>Also, I liked the option to choose what to sync next while syncing a ton of files, like this:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="520" data-permalink="https://hulry.com/dropbox-vs-others/dropbox-choose-sync-next/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-choose-sync-next.png?fit=1612%2C1374&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1612,1374" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="dropbox-choose-sync-next" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-choose-sync-next.png?fit=300%2C256&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-choose-sync-next.png?fit=580%2C494&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-choose-sync-next.png?resize=580%2C494&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="Choosing what to sync next in the Dropbox app." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-choose-sync-next.png?resize=1024%2C873&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-choose-sync-next.png?resize=300%2C256&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-choose-sync-next.png?resize=768%2C655&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-choose-sync-next.png?resize=1536%2C1309&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-choose-sync-next.png?resize=1200%2C1023&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-choose-sync-next.png?w=1612&amp;ssl=1 1612w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-choose-sync-next.png?resize=580%2C494&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Choosing what to sync next in the Dropbox app.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I haven’t used this feature, yet. Neither did I explore other apps for this option.</p>



<p>It’s a nice to have kind of feature.</p>



<p>What I’m trying to establish here is that the Dropbox app is well built with an outstanding UX.</p>



<p>Now:</p>



<p>Even if I overlooked occasional syncing issues with other services:</p>



<h2>Dropbox’s Smart Sync feature sealed the deal</h2>



<p>I had about 30GB of RAW photos uploaded on my Google Drive. The problem with Google’s storage approach was:</p>



<ul><li>If I choose to have the files locally, I lose out local storage space.</li><li>If I choose to have the files be cloud-only and not sync locally, I lose out easy access to those files on my laptop.</li></ul>



<p>Dropbox’s Smart Sync is the middle ground.</p>



<p>I can have my photos show up locally as files, browsable by all apps on the system, but not take up space.</p>



<p>What Smart Sync does, is retain a reference to the files which are selected to be present as “Online Only”, and download them when accessed for the first time.</p>



<p>Yesterday, I needed to edit a RAW photo from my photos folder, which was smart synced. </p>



<p>I opened the photo on Pixelmator Pro, and Dropbox downloaded the file and made it available to Pixelmator.</p>



<p>It’s this convenience that’s a massive win for me. I have a MacBook Pro with only 256GB storage, out of which I have only about 38GB free to use.</p>

<p>I can now have my large files online only to save space locally, but also have easy access to them when needed.</p>



<p>With Google Drive, I had to download files by going over to the Google Drive web app.</p>



<p>Now, with Dropbox:</p>



<p>To mark a file to be kept online only, here’s what I do:</p>

<p>The above demonstration is for macOS, but the process will be similar for other platforms as well.</p>



<p>A point to note, though:</p>



<p>The other cloud services I tested, OneDrive also has a similar smart sync feature.</p>



<p>However, that wasn’t enough to convince me because I had bigger concerns with OneDrive’s privacy policies.</p>



<p>Features aside:</p>



<p>I’m a sucker for elegant UI. Naturally:</p>



<h2>Dropbox’s UI was love at first sight</h2>



<p>I have tried out a ton of cloud storage services, namely, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.google.com/drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Drive</a>, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mega.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mega</a>, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sync.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sync</a>, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OneDrive</a>, and Apple’s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.icloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iCloud</a>.</p>



<p>No one has as well designed and consistent looking apps like Dropbox.</p>



<p>Dropbox everywhere, be it web, mobile, or laptop, looks gorgeous and consistent.</p>



<p>This is what the web app looks like:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="523" data-permalink="https://hulry.com/dropbox-vs-others/dropbox-web-ui/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?fit=3360%2C1944&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="3360,1944" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="dropbox-web-ui" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?fit=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?fit=580%2C335&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?resize=580%2C335&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="Dropbox's web app." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?resize=1024%2C592&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?resize=768%2C444&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?resize=1536%2C889&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?resize=2048%2C1185&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?resize=1200%2C694&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?resize=1980%2C1146&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?w=1740&amp;ssl=1 1740w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/hulry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dropbox-web-ui.png?resize=580%2C335&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Dropbox’s gorgeous web app.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Okay, so we have talked about features and UI. However, pricing is also a significant factor in choosing one service over the other.</p>



<p>Here’s:</p>



<h2>How Dropbox compares to others in pricing</h2>



<p>Dropbox has probably the least generous free storage plan. It offers 2GB of storage with incentives to earn more storage by referring people.</p>



<p>The logical path for most people would be to upgrade to a pro plan.</p>



<p>Here’s what a decent yearly plan costs across services:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Dropbox (2TB)</strong>: $119.88/yr</li><li><strong>Google Drive (2TB)</strong>: $119.88/yr</li><li><strong>Mega (2TB)</strong>: $140.34/yr</li><li><strong>OneDrive (1TB)</strong>: $69.99/yr</li><li><strong>iCloud (2TB)</strong>: $119.88/yr</li><li><strong>Sync (2TB)</strong>: $96/yr</li></ul>



<p>Dropbox’s pricing is in the mid-range, the same as that of Google Drive and iCloud.</p>



<p>OneDrive has lower pricing, but the space offered is half of what other services provide.</p>



<p>Mega is the most expensive, and has a weird bandwidth limit of 2TB/month. I mean, who puts a bandwidth limit of personal cloud storage these days.</p>



<p>Dropbox seemed like the right choice, pricing-wise as well.</p>



<p>Now:</p>



<h2>Coming back to the privacy concerns</h2>



<p>At the start of this post, I mentioned that Dropbox wasn’t exactly privacy-friendly. </p>



<p>They do analyse user data from time to time to improve their product, and possibly for other reasons as well.</p>



<p>In terms of privacy, my first choice was iCloud. Apple has a better reputation in protecting user privacy amongst the giant corporations. </p>



<p>But, iCloud is heavily tied to the Apple ecosystem. This tie-up makes it hard for me to access my files stored on iCloud on non-Apple devices.</p>



<p>Google Drive and OneDrive didn’t fit the bill because of how they use user data. Both companies use user data for their search and ads platform. I don’t want to volunteer my files for their ad marketing researches.</p>



<p>Although Dropbox’s algorithms go through user data, they don’t have an ads platform, which gives it a little edge over Google and Microsoft.</p>



<p>Mega and Sync were less known services, and since their apps didn’t have extraordinary capabilities, I ruled them out from the list as well.</p>



<p>Dropbox was the clear winner.</p>



<p>But:</p>



<h2>Will Dropbox be a suitable choice for you too?</h2>



<p>Hard to say.</p>



<p>If you’re like me, looking for a balance between privacy and features, Dropbox is an excellent choice.</p>



<p>But, if you value privacy over everything else, you can look into end-to-end encrypted cloud storage services like:</p>



<ul><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mega.nz/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mega</a></li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sync.com/your-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sync</a></li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://tresorit.com/online-storage-and-backup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tresorit</a></li></ul>



<p>Whatever you do, stay away from Google and Microsoft. You shouldn’t have to pay with both money and data.</p>



<p>If you’re going with Dropbox, you can use my link to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://db.tt/edYoYWJpxS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">get 500MB of extra storage space</a> for free.</p>
