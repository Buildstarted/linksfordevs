I’m using the Enterprise Edition on macOS, which is free to evaluate as we’re doing here, but the instructions will also work on Linux. Most of them will also work with the Community Edition.</p><p id="c711" data-selectable-paragraph="">Follow along and run these programs while you’re reading! The code I’m running on GraalVM can be cloned from <a href="http://github.com/chrisseaton/graalvm-ten-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">github.com/chrisseaton/graalvm-ten-things/</a>.</p><p id="bcb2" data-selectable-paragraph="">I’ve downloaded GraalVM Enterprise Edition based on JDK8 for macOS from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/downloads/graalvm-downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://www.oracle.com/downloads/graalvm-downloads.html</a>, and put the programs from it onto my <code>$PATH</code>.

I’ve installed the Ruby, Python and R languages. I’ve also installed the <code>native-image</code>tool. These all get downloaded from GitHub.</p><pre><span id="61c3" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ gu install native-image<br>$ gu install ruby<br>$ gu install python<br>$ gu install R</span></pre><p id="1222" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now when you run <code>java</code> or <code>js</code> you'll get the GraalVM versions of those runtimes.</p><pre><span id="48ed" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ java -version<br>java version "1.8.0_231"<br>Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_231-b11)<br>Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit GraalVM EE 19.3.0 (build 25.231-b11-jvmci-19.3-b05, mixed mode)</span><span id="bac6" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ js --version<br>GraalVM JavaScript (GraalVM EE Native 19.3.0)</span></pre><p id="b872" data-selectable-paragraph="">The <em>Graal</em> name in the GraalVM comes from the GraalVM compiler. GraalVM is <a href="http://lafo.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/papers/2013_Onward_OneVMToRuleThemAll.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one compiler to rule them all</a>, meaning that it’s a single implementation of a compiler written as a library which can be used for many different things. For example we use the GraalVM compiler to compile both <em>ahead-of-time</em> and <em>just-in-time</em>, to compile multiple programming languages, and to multiple architectures.</p><p id="037d" data-selectable-paragraph="">One simple way to use GraalVM is to use it as your Java JIT compiler.</p><p id="2999" data-selectable-paragraph="">We’ll use this example program, which gives you the top-ten words in a document. It uses modern Java language features like streams and collectors.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="c17f" data-selectable-paragraph="">GraalVM includes a <code>javac</code> compiler, but it isn't any different from the standard one for the purposes of this demo, so you could use your system <code>javac</code> instead if you wanted to.</p><pre><span id="7dcd" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ javac TopTen.java</span></pre><p id="4174" data-selectable-paragraph="">If we run the <code>java</code> command included in GraalVM we'll be automatically using the Graal JIT compiler - no extra configuration is needed. I'll use the <code>time</code> command to get the real, wall-clock elapsed time it takes to run the entire program from start to finish, rather than setting up a complicated micro-benchmark, and I'll use a large input so that we aren't quibbling about a few seconds here or there. The <code>large.txt</code> file is 150 MB.</p><pre><span id="5c83" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ make large.txt<br>$ time java TopTen large.txt<br>sed = 502701<br>ut = 392657<br>in = 377651<br>et = 352641<br>id = 317627<br>eu = 317627<br>eget = 302621<br>vel = 300120<br>a = 287615<br>sit = 282613</span><span id="7a8a" data-selectable-paragraph="">real  0m12.950s<br>user  0m17.827s<br>sys 0m0.622s</span></pre><p id="a531" data-selectable-paragraph="">GraalVM is written in Java, rather than C++ like most other JIT compilers for Java. We think this allows us to improve it more quickly than existing compilers, with powerful new optimisations such as partial escape analysis that aren’t available in the standard JIT compilers for HotSpot. This can make your Java programs run significantly faster.</p><p id="bfaa" data-selectable-paragraph="">To run without the GraalVM JIT compiler to compare, I can use the flag <code>-XX:-UseJVMCICompiler</code>. JVMCI is the interface between GraalVM and the JVM. You could also compare against your standard JVM as well.</p><pre><span id="2871" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ time java -XX:-UseJVMCICompiler TopTen large.txt<br>sed = 502701<br>ut = 392657<br>in = 377651<br>et = 352641<br>id = 317627<br>eu = 317627<br>eget = 302621<br>vel = 300120<br>a = 287615<br>sit = 282613</span><span id="5b96" data-selectable-paragraph="">real  0m19.602s<br>user  0m20.357s<br>sys 0m0.498s</span></pre><p id="8f8d" data-selectable-paragraph="">This shows GraalVM running our Java program in around two-thirds of the wall-clock time it takes to run it with a standard HotSpot compiler. In an area where we are used to treating single-digit percentage increases in performance as significant, this is a big-deal.</p><p id="e280" data-selectable-paragraph="">You’ll still get a result better than HotSpot if you use the Community Edition, but it won’t be quite as a good as the Enterprise Edition.</p><p id="22b0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Twitter are one company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSyvidFXL7M" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">using GraalVM in production today</a>, and they say that for them it is paying off in terms of real money saved. Twitter are using GraalVM to run Scala applications — GraalVM works at the level of JVM bytecode so it works for any JVM language.</p><p id="b6b1" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is the first way you can use GraalVM — simply as a drop-in better JIT compiler for your existing Java applications.</p><p id="412b" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Java platform is particularly strong for long-running processes and peak performance, but short-running processes can suffer from longer startup time and relatively high memory usage.</p><p id="7624" data-selectable-paragraph="">For example, if we run the same application with a much smaller input — around 1 KB instead of 150 MB, then it seems to take an unreasonably long time, and quite a lot of memory at 70 MB, to run for such a small file. We use <code>-l</code> to print the memory used as well as time used.</p><pre><span id="2f24" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ make small.txt<br>$ /usr/bin/time -l java TopTen small.txt<br>      # -v on Linux instead of -l<br>sed = 6<br>sit = 6<br>amet = 6<br>mauris = 3<br>volutpat = 3<br>vitae = 3<br>dolor = 3<br>libero = 3<br>tempor = 2<br>suscipit = 2<br>        0.17 real         0.28 user         0.04 sys<br>  70737920  maximum resident set size<br>...</span></pre><p id="9511" data-selectable-paragraph="">GraalVM gives us a tool that solves this problem. We said that GraalVM is like a compiler library and it can be used in many different ways. One of those is to compile <em>ahead-of-time</em>, to a native executable image, instead of compiling <em>just-in-time</em> at runtime. This is similar to how a conventional compiler like <code>gcc</code> works.</p><pre><span id="31f1" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ native-image --no-server --no-fallback TopTen<br>[topten:37970]    classlist:   1,801.57 ms<br>[topten:37970]        (cap):   1,289.45 ms<br>[topten:37970]        setup:   3,087.67 ms<br>[topten:37970]   (typeflow):   6,704.85 ms<br>[topten:37970]    (objects):   6,448.88 ms<br>[topten:37970]   (features):     820.90 ms<br>[topten:37970]     analysis:  14,271.88 ms<br>[topten:37970]     (clinit):     257.25 ms<br>[topten:37970]     universe:     766.11 ms<br>[topten:37970]      (parse):   1,365.29 ms<br>[topten:37970]     (inline):   3,829.55 ms<br>[topten:37970]    (compile):  34,674.51 ms<br>[topten:37970]      compile:  41,412.71 ms<br>[topten:37970]        image:   2,741.41 ms<br>[topten:37970]        write:     619.13 ms<br>[topten:37970]      [total]:  64,891.52 ms</span></pre><p id="fd05" data-selectable-paragraph="">This command produces a native executable called <code>topten</code>. This executable isn’t a launcher for the JVM, it doesn’t link to the JVM, and it doesn’t bundle the JVM in any way. <code>native-image</code> really does compile your Java code, and any Java libraries you use, all the way down to simple machine code. For runtime components like the garbage collector we are running our own new VM called the <mark>SubstrateVM</mark>, which like GraalVM is also written in Java.</p><p id="9b75" data-selectable-paragraph="">If we look at the libraries which <code>topten</code> uses you can see they are only standard system libraries. We could also move just this one file to a system which has never had a JVM installed and run it there to verify it doesn’t use a JVM or any other files. It’s also pretty small - this executable is less than 8 MB.</p><pre><span id="8770" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ otool -L topten    # ldd topten on Linux<br>topten:<br>  libSystem.B.dylib (current version 1252.250.1)<br>  CoreFoundation (current version 1575.12.0)<br>  /usr/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.11)<br>$ du -h topten <br>7.5M  topten</span></pre><p id="cfb8" data-selectable-paragraph="">If we run the executable we can see that it starts around an order of magnitude faster, and uses around an order of magnitude less memory, than running the same program on the JVM does. It’s so fast that you don’t notice the time taken when using it at the command line — you don’t feel that pause you always get when running a short-running command with the JVM.</p><pre><span id="0b78" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ /usr/bin/time -l ./topten small.txt<br>sed = 6<br>sit = 6<br>amet = 6<br>mauris = 3<br>volutpat = 3<br>vitae = 3<br>dolor = 3<br>libero = 3<br>tempor = 2<br>suscipit = 2<br>        0.02 real         0.00 user         0.00 sys<br>   3158016  maximum resident set size<br>...</span></pre><p id="e54f" data-selectable-paragraph="">The <code>native-image </code>tool has some <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/LIMITATIONS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">restrictions</a> such as all classes having to be available during compilation, and some limitations around reflection. It has some additional advantages over basic compilation as well in that static initializers are run during compilation, so you can reduce the work done each time an application loads.</p><p id="69dc" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is a second way that you can use GraalVM — a way to distribute and run your existing Java programs with a low-footprint and fast-startup. It also frees you from configuration issues such as finding the right jar files at runtime, and allows you to have smaller Docker images.</p><p id="ac57" data-selectable-paragraph="">As well as Java, GraalVM includes new implementations of JavaScript, Ruby, R and Python. These are written using a new language implementation framework called <em>Truffle</em> that makes it possible to implement language interpreters that are both simple and high performance. When you write a language interpreter using Truffle, Truffle will automatically use GraalVM on your behalf to give you a JIT compiler for your language. So GraalVM is not only a JIT compiler and ahead-of-time native compiler for Java, it can also be a JIT compiler for JavaScript, Ruby, R and Python.</p><p id="6413" data-selectable-paragraph="">The languages in GraalVM aim to be drop-in replacements for your existing languages. For example we can install a Node.js module:</p><pre><span id="4d62" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ npm install color<br>...<br>+ color@3.1.1<br>added 6 packages from 6 contributors and audited 7 packages in 6.931s</span></pre><p id="cad6" data-selectable-paragraph="">We can write a little program <em>color.js</em> using this module to convert an RGB HTML color to HSL:</p><pre><span id="a75c" data-selectable-paragraph="">var Color = require('color');</span><span id="6796" data-selectable-paragraph="">process.argv.slice(2).forEach(function (val) {<br>  console.log(Color(val).hsl().string());<br>});</span></pre><p id="de12" data-selectable-paragraph="">Then we can run that in the usual way:</p><pre><span id="84c4" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ node color.js '#42aaf4'<br>hsl(204.89999999999998, 89%, 60.8%)</span></pre><p id="725e" data-selectable-paragraph="">The languages in GraalVM work together — there’s an API which lets you run code from one language in another. This lets you write polyglot programs — programs written in more than one language.</p><p id="aee0" data-selectable-paragraph="">You might want to do this because you want to write the majority of your application in one language, but there’s a library in another language’s ecosystem that you’d like to use. For example, say we’d like to write our application for converting a CSS color name to hexadecimal in Node.js, but we want to use a Ruby color library instead to do the conversion.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="06d7" data-selectable-paragraph="">We specify some Ruby code to run as a string, but notice that we don’t do much in it — we just require the libraries, and then return a Ruby object. The way to use this object from Ruby is normally to say <code>Color::RGB.by_name(name).html</code>. If you look at how <code>color_rgb</code> is used further down by JavaScript, you can see that actually we're calling these methods from JavaScript, even though they are Ruby objects and methods, and we pass them a JavaScript string, and we concatenate the result, which is a Ruby string, with other JavaScript strings.</p><p id="a7ea" data-selectable-paragraph="">We’ll install both our Ruby and JavaScript dependencies.</p><pre><span id="80b6" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ gem install color<br>Fetching: color-1.8.gem (100%)<br>Successfully installed color-1.8<br>1 gem installed</span><span id="825d" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ npm install express<br>+ express@4.17.0<br>added 50 packages from 37 contributors and audited 143 packages in 22.431s</span></pre><p id="61ff" data-selectable-paragraph="">We then need to run <code>node</code> with a couple of options: <code>--polyglot</code> to say we want access to other languages, and <code>--jvm</code> because the <code>node</code> native image by default doesn't include more than JavaScript.</p><pre><span id="19ec" data-selectable-paragraph="">$ node --polyglot --jvm color-server.js<br>serving at <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">http://localhost:8080</a></span></pre><p id="592e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Then open <a href="http://localhost:8080/css/aquamarine" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">http://localhost:8080/css/aquamarine</a>, or some other colour name, as normal in your browser.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*FFrMNcdEuhIgiHz7gp54Ig.png?q=20" width="1632" height="1192" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="1632" height="1192" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="121c" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s try a larger example using more languages and modules.</p><p id="f57f" data-selectable-paragraph="">JavaScript doesn’t have a great solution for arbitrarily-large integers. I found several modules like <code>big-integer</code> but these are all inefficient as they store components of the number as JavaScript floating point numbers. Java's <code>BigInteger</code> class is more efficient so let's use that instead to do some arbitrarily-large integer arithmetic.</p><p id="2b2c" data-selectable-paragraph="">JavaScript also doesn’t include any built-in support for drawing graphs, where R does include excellent support for this. Let’s use R’s <code>svg</code> module to draw a 3D scatter plot of a trigonometric function.</p><p id="46de" data-selectable-paragraph="">In both cases we can use GraalVM’s polyglot API, and we can just compose the results from these other languages into JavaScript.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="38aa" data-selectable-paragraph="">Open <a href="http://localhost:3000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">http://localhost:3000/</a> in your browser to see the result.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*NPuHZJZouIOMaVSjey9xUg.png?q=20" width="1632" height="1440" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="1632" height="1440" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div></figure><p id="1fe3" data-selectable-paragraph="">That’s the third thing we can do with GraalVM — run programs written in multiple languages and use modules from those languages together. We think of this as a kind of commoditisation of languages and modules — you can use whichever language you think is best for your problem at hand, and whichever library you want, no matter which language it came from.</p><p id="da89" data-selectable-paragraph="">Another language that GraalVM supports is C. GraalVM can run C code in the same way that it runs languages like JavaScript and Ruby.</p><p id="a39e" data-selectable-paragraph="">What GraalVM actually supports is running the output of the LLVM toolchain — LLVM bitcode — rather than directly supporting C. This means you can use your existing tooling with C, and also other languages that can output LLVM, such as C++, Fortran, and potentially other languages in the future. To make things simple for a demo I’m running a special <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/smcc/projects/single-file-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">single-file version</a> of gzip, maintained by <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/smcc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stephen McCamant</a>.
