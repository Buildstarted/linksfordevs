<p>While Global X may monitor postings by third parties on its profiles and pages, Global X is not able to review them before they are displayed, and any such postings are the views and responsibilities of the posters. Global X does reserve the right to edit or remove any post for any reason and to block followers to the extent permitted by the sites. If Global X does not remove a third-party post, it is not an endorsement of the content.</p>
