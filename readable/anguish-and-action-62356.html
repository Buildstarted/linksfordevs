<p>We work to help leaders change their world—and the world needs changing. The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and the loss of far too many Black lives to list, have left our nation anguished and outraged. While now is a time for grief and anger, it is also a time for resolve. Find resources below to learn what you can do to create a more just and equitable world.</p>

<div><p>Over 1,000 people are killed by police every year in America, and Black people are three times more likely to be killed than White people. We can take steps and make reforms to combat police violence and systemic racism within law enforcement.</p>
<p>President Obama pushed many of these reforms during his time in office, and started the My Brother’s Keeper initiative in the wake of Trayvon Martin’s death to break down barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. But far more progress remains to be made. We’re inspired by those protesting for accountability and change, even in the face of a pandemic. If you’re looking for additional ways to advocate for change, below you’ll find resources to learn about police violence and antiracism as well as actions you can take to encourage reform from organizations who have been working on these issues at the local and national level for years. And be sure to read the statements from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CAxyXWOAPiL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Obama</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CAyhdCeAmBZ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mrs. Obama</a> on the killing of George Floyd, and learn more about the work of the <a href="http://obama.org/mbka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Brother’s Keeper Alliance.</a></p>
