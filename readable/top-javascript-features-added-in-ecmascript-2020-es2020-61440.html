			<p><span>JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, and features are now added to the language every year. This article covers new features added in ECMAScript 2020, also known as ES11.</span></p>
<p>Before the introduction of ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, JavaScript language development had a very slow pace. Fortunately, since then, new features are added every year. Be aware that not all features might be supported in all modern browsers yet, but thanks to transpilers like <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, we can use them already today. This article will cover some of the latest additions to JavaScript — ECMAScript 2020 (ES11).</p>
<h2 id="optionalchaining">Optional Chaining</h2>
<p>I’m sure that most developers are familiar with an error of this kind:</p>
<p><code>TypeError: Cannot read property ‘x’ of undefined</code></p>
<p>This error basically means that we tried to access a property on something that is not an object. </p>
<h3 id="accessinganobjectproperty">Accessing an Object Property</h3>

<p>JavaScript engine will always throw an error in a scenario like this. However, there are cases in which it doesn't matter that the value isn't there yet, because we might know it will be. Fortunately, here is the optional chaining feature to the rescue! </p>
<p>We can use the optional chaining operator, which consists of a question mark and a dot: <strong><code>?.</code></strong>, to indicate that an error should not be thrown. Instead, if there is no value, <em>undefined</em> will be returned. </p>

<p>Optional chaining can also be used when accessing array values or calling a function.</p>
<h3 id="accessinganarray">Accessing an Array</h3>

<h3 id="callingafunction">Calling a Function</h3>

<h2 id="nullishcoalescing">Nullish Coalescing</h2>
<p>Until recently, whenever there was a need to provide a fallback value, the logical operator <strong><code>||</code></strong> had to be used. It works in most cases, but it can't be applied in some scenarios. For instance, if the initial value is a Boolean or a number. Let's take a look at an example below, where we want to assign a number to a variable, or default it to 7 if the initial value is not a number:</p>

<p>The <em>myNumber</em> variable is equal to 1, because the left-hand value (<em>number</em>) is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy"><em>truthy</em></a> value, as 1 is a positive number. However, what if the <em>number</em> variable is not 1, but 0?</p>

<p>0 is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy"><em>falsy</em></a> value, and even though it is a number, the <em>myNumber</em> variable will have the right-hand value assigned to it. Therefore, <em>myNumber</em> is now equal to 7. However, that's not really what we want. Fortunately, instead of writing additional code and checks to confirm if the <em>number</em> variable is indeed a number, we can use the nullish coalescing operator. It consists of two question marks: <strong><code>??</code></strong>.</p>

<p>The right-hand side value will only be assigned if the left-hand value is equal to <em>null</em> or <em>undefined</em>. Therefore, in the example above, the <em>myNumber</em> variable is equal to 0.</p>
<h2 id="privatefields">Private Fields</h2>
<p>Many programming languages that have <em>classes</em> allow defining class properties as public, protected, or private. <em>Public</em> properties can be accessed from outside of a class and by its subclasses, while <em>protected</em>&nbsp;classes can only be accessed by subclasses. However, <em>private</em> properties can only be accessed from inside of a class. JavaScript supports class syntax since <em>ES6</em>, but only now were private fields introduced. To define a private property, it has to be prefixed with the hash symbol: <strong><code>#</code></strong>.</p>

<p>If we try to access a private property from outside, an error will be thrown.</p>
<h2 id="staticfields">Static Fields</h2>
<p>To use a class method, a class had to be instantiated first, as shown below.</p>

<p>Trying to access a method without instantiating the <em>Flower</em> class would result in an error. Thanks to <em>static</em> fields, a class method can now be declared with the <em>static</em> keyword and called from outside of a class.</p>

<h2 id="toplevelawait">Top Level Await</h2>
<p>So far, to <em>await</em> for a promise to finish, a function in which <em>await</em> is used would need to be defined with the <em>async</em> keyword.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if there was a need to await for something in a global scope, it would not be possible, and usually required an <em>immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)</em>.</p>

<p>Thanks to <em>Top Level Await</em>, there is no need for wrapping code in an async function anymore, and this code will work.</p>

<p>This feature could be useful for resolving module dependencies or using a fallback source if the initial one failed.</p>

<h2 id="promiseallsettled">Promise.allSettled</h2>
<p>To wait for multiple promises to finish, <em>Promise.all([promise_1, promise_2])</em> can be used. The problem is that if one of them fails, then an error will be thrown. Nevertheless, there are cases in which it is ok for one of the promises to fail, and the rest should still resolve. To achieve that, <em>ES11</em> introduced <em>Promise.allSettled</em>.</p>

<p>A resolved promise will return an object with <em>status</em> and <em>value</em> properties, while rejected ones will have <em>status</em> and <em>reason</em>.</p>
<h2 id="dynamicimport">Dynamic Import</h2>
<p>You might have used dynamic imports when using <em>webpack</em> for module bundling. Finally, native support for this feature is here.</p>

<p>Considering the fact that a lot applications use module bundlers like webpack for transpiling and optimizing code, this feature isn't such a big deal right now.</p>
<h2 id="matchall">MatchAll</h2>
<p>MatchAll is useful for applying the same regular expression to a string if you need to find all matches and get their positions. The <em>match</em> method only returns items that were matched.</p>

<p><em>matchAll</em> in contrast, returns a bit more information, including index of the string found.</p>

<h2 id="globalthis">globalThis</h2>
<p>JavaScript can run in different environments like browsers or Node.js. A global object in browsers is available under <em>window</em> variable, but in Node it is an object called <em>global</em>. To make it easier to use a global object no matter in which environment code is running, <em>globalThis</em> was introduced.</p>

<h2 id="bigint">BigInt</h2>
<p>The maximum number that can be reliably represented in JavaScript is 2^53 - 1. BigInt will allow creation of numbers even bigger than that.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope you found this article useful and are as excited as I am about the new features that are coming to JavaScript.
