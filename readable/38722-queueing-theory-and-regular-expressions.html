<p>Queueing theory is the study of waiting in line. That may not sound very interesting, but the subject is full of surprises. For example, when a server is near capacity, adding a second server can cut backlog not just in half but by an order of magnitude or more. More on that <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/10/21/what-happens-when-you-add-a-new-teller/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I&#x2019;m not going to look at the content of queueing theory but just the name. When seeing the word <em>queueing</em>, many people assume it is misspelled and want to replace it with <em>queuing</em>. As I write this, my spell checker is recommending that change. But the large majority of people in the field call their subject <em>queueing</em> theory.</p>
<p><em>Queueing</em> has five consecutive vowels. Are there any other English words with so many vowels in a row? To find out, I did an experiment like the <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/10/20/good-old-regular-expressions/">classic examples</a> from Kernighan and Pike demonstrating regular expressions by searching a dictionary for words with various patterns.</p>
<p>The first obstacle I ran into is that apparently Ubuntu doesn&#x2019;t come with a dictionary file. However <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/301282/does-ubuntu-come-with-dictionary-list-of-words-file">this post</a> explains how to install one.</p>
<p>The second obstacle was that <em>queueing</em> wasn&#x2019;t in the dictionary. I first searched the American English dictionary, and it didn&#x2019;t include this particular word. But then I searched the British English dictionary and found it.</p>
<p>Now, to find all words with five consecutive vowels, I ran this:</p>
<pre>    egrep &apos;[aeiou]{5}&apos; british-english</pre>
<p>and got back only one result: <em>queueing</em>. So at least in this dictionary of 101,825 words, the only word with five (or more) consecutive vowels is <em>queueing</em>.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity I checked how many words have at least four consecutive vowels. The command</p>
<pre>    grep -E &quot;[aeiou]{4}&quot; british-english | wc -l</pre>
<p>returns 40, and the corresponding command with the file <code>american-english</code> returns 39. So both dictionaries contain 39 words with exactly four vowels in a row and no more. But are they they same 39 words? In fact they are. And one of the words is <em>queuing</em>, and so apparently that is an acceptable spelling in both American and British English. But as a technical term in mathematics, the accepted spelling is <em>queueing</em>.</p>
<p>Some of the 39 words are plurals or possessives of other words. For example, the list begins with Hawaiian, Hawaiian&#x2019;s, and Hawaiians. (Unix sorts capital letters before lower case letters.) After removing plurals and possessives, we have 23 words with four consecutive vowels:</p>
<pre>Hawaiian
Iroquoian
Kauai
Kilauea
Louie
Montesquieu
Quaoar
Rouault
aqueous
gooier
gooiest
obsequious
obsequiously
obsequiousness
onomatopoeia
pharmacopoeia
plateaued
plateauing
queue
queued
queues
queuing
sequoia
</pre>
<p>It&#x2019;s interesting that three of the words are related to Hawaii: Kuaui is an Hawaiian island and Kulauea is a Hawaiian volcano.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;d never heard of Quaoar before. It&#x2019;s a Kuiper belt object about half the size of Pluto.</p>
