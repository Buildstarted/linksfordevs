As a celebration, I&apos;m going to be giving away licenses of some of my favorite developer tools over the next several weeks. All you have to do is be a subscriber to the newsletter. Coming first: this week I&apos;m giving away licenses for GitKraken Pro!<p>GitKraken is one of my favorite Git GUI clients, and it offers Git novices and pros a consistent experience across Mac, Windows and Linux. And makes Git operations not only performant and efficient, but understandable, visual, and perhaps even just a little bit... fun! </p></div> </div> <ul id="article_list"> <li> <a class="article_link" href="https://medium.com/@MStrehovsky/building-a-self-contained-game-in-c-under-8-kilobytes-74c3cf60ea04">Building a self-contained game in C# under 8 kilobytes</a><br> With .NET Core you can package a stand-alone application that includes the runtime, but with a simple application, a na&#xEF;ve compilation creates a binary that&apos;s 65 MB. Can you shrink it? Yes, all the way to <em>8 KB</em> if you want to be aggressive. &#x1F633; <br><span class="author">Michal Strehovsk&#xFD;</span> </li> <li> <a class="article_link" href="https://blog.ryanlevick.com/down-the-stack-part-1/">Down the Stack: Compiled Rust Part 1</a><br> One of the great things about Rust is that it&apos;s truly a systems language - instead of requiring a runtime, it compiles down to machine code. The nice thing about Rust is that you don&apos;t <em>have</em> to go deep. But what if you want to?

It takes principled product management, tight engineering and - of course - good tooling to scope an MVP, build it and deliver it safely. <p><span class="author">Mike Coutermarsh</span> </p></li> </ul> </div></div>
