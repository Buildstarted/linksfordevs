Content Warning: rape, sexual assault, whistleblower&nbsp;retaliation
</p>

<p>Sarah Jeong‚Äôs recent article,
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/21/16807116/infosec-community-sexual-predators-weinstein-assault"><i>Vulnerabilities and exploits: what happened when the infosec community outed its own sexual predators</i></a>,
discusses some positive cultural changes in North America since the outings of
serial rapists Jacob Appelbaum and Morgan&nbsp;Marquis-Boire.</p>
<p>This post is not about those positive changes.  This post is about people and
organisations which haven‚Äôt changed, such as the Chaos Computer Club (<span>CCC</span>), who
have attempted to save face in public, while privately working to undermine
positive change and enable&nbsp;rapists.</p>


<p>In June 2016,
<a href="https://blog.patternsinthevoid.net/the-forest-for-the-trees.html">I</a> and
<a href="http://jacobappelbaum.net/">others</a> spoke up about serial rapist and abuser,
Jacob Appelbaum.  Unlike other organisations ‚Äî such as The Tor Project, or The
Cult of the Dead Cow ‚Äî the <span>CCC</span> delayed for more than a month in responding.
Eventually, their hand was forced by
<a href="https://twitter.com/chaosupdales/status/743197667157762048">a parody ‚Äú@chaosupdales‚Äù Twitter account</a>
announcing that the <span>CCC</span> had expelled Jake.  First,
the <span>CCC</span> clarified that they had not expelled Jake.  Then, the <span>CCC</span> posted a vague
statement that ‚Äúall are welcome‚Äù.  Finally, the <span>CCC</span> claimed that their statement
had, ‚Äúof course‚Äù, referred to Jake all along.  Of course, they only clarified
this on Twitter and never updated their statement. In English, this is called&nbsp;‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù.</p>
<p>There were no Tor talks last year at 33C3, because every Tor talk submitted was
silently removed by the <span>CCC</span> to ‚Äúavoid controversy‚Äù.  Before the congress, the
<span>CCC</span> requested a meeting with their selection of representatives from Tor to
discuss a way forward.  I requested to attend the meeting, and was forbidden
from attending by the <span>CCC</span> organisers, who said that the meeting would not occur
if I were present.
Two other members of the Tor community were expelled for their participation in
<a href="http://jacobappelbaum.net/#stories">River‚Äôs brutal assault</a>.
The <span>CCC</span> continued their pattern of feigning interest in making progress, while
privately showing no interest in learning about what had happened from the&nbsp;survivors.</p>
<p>One of those expelled was
7a573b399812f3260385bd1790cd3e22612fad1b02ad8d95946bd096f1c8455d (hereafter
truncated to ‚Äú7a573b39‚Äù), the second
participant in River‚Äôs account, which describes a horrific assault while she was
intoxicated to the point of being non-responsive.  Unlike my coworkers, 7a573b39 was
given a talk at 33C3.  (Ironically, on a project I helped design and implement.)
This was the <span>CCC</span>‚Äôs idea of the way&nbsp;forward.</p>
<p>Survivors of Jacob‚Äôs abuse had collectively agreed to give 7a573b39 a second
chance: he said he had been manipulated by Jake into participating in the rape;
he did not appear to have committed any similar abuse; he expressed remorse and
apologised to River; he claimed to have taken a class on not only recognising,
but enacting bystander intervention in sexual&nbsp;harassment.</p>
<p>Here is 7a573b39 nine months later, in September 2017, standing next to&nbsp;Jake:</p>

    </a>
  </p>

<p>This photo was taken in Cuba at ASCrypto, a self-described school for ‚Äúgraduate
students in cryptography‚Äù aiming to ‚Äúbuild cryptologic research capacity in the
region‚Äù.  7a573b39 explained to others within the Tor Project that he hadn‚Äôt
intended to run into Jake, and that Jake had ‚Äúfollowed‚Äù him around ‚Äúharassing
him‚Äù the whole&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>7a573b39 is not a student of cryptography, so it seems pretty implausible that he‚Äôd
fly all the way to Cuba for a cryptography school with lectures given by Jacob‚Äôs
advisers and enablers,
<a href="https://medium.com/@hdevalence/when-hell-kept-on-payroll-somewhere-is-where-you-are-f419d3022d0">Dan Bernstein and Tanja Lange</a>,
and then be shocked (<em>shocked!</em>) to discover Jacob there.  But even if this
story were true, standing idly by your fellow abuser is not the action of
someone who feels genuine remorse or&nbsp;regret.</p>
<p>This appears to be the same pattern of behaviour as the <span>CCC</span>: in
public, do the bare minimum to feign progress; in private, do whatever
they think they can get away&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>This year, for 34C3, the <span>CCC</span> rejected talks discussing harassment and abuse, yet
they found time to give 7a573b39 <em>two</em> talks.  They shut down
conversations on paths towards progress, safety, and inclusivity, but they allow
<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRQupEeXUAAI_T7.jpg">an assembly</a> which proclaims
‚Äúa code-of-conduct free zone‚Äù, warning attendees to ‚Äúenter at own risk‚Äù.  It is never enough to just
work against abusers.  The rot stems from within a larger system, and it
is vital to fight, root and branch, against the organisations, structures, and
people which enable sexual assault, harassment, and other forms of
discrimination.  The <span>CCC</span>‚Äôs actions have been entirely within bad faith, meant to
cause and enable further harm.  I do not say this lightly: the <span>CCC</span> hates&nbsp;women.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Edit (2017-12-27 18:00): After additional conversations with River, we have
agreed to edit this post in the following&nbsp;ways:</em></p>
<p>First, it is important to clarify that River describes Jacob Appelbaum‚Äôs actions
as rape, and the other participant‚Äôs actions as sexual assault.  Further, we
would like to make clear the differences between the two: Jacob has never
attempted any apology to any of his survivors (and instead has proceeded to
threaten and direct further abuses at them), while the other participant, as
described above, has taken every step asked of him in an accountability process,
only to afterwards betray survivors.  There are degrees to violence and
sexualised violence, and, within context, the actions of one abuser should not
necessarily be categorised as equivalent to another.  (The author, isis agora
lovecruft, takes full responsibility for the mistakes in the original word
choices and would like to point out the importance of having
<a href="https://crimethinc.com/2013/04/17/accounting-for-ourselves-breaking-the-impasse-around-assault-and-abuse-in-anarchist-scenes">survivor-led processes and noting the ways in which accountability may fail</a>.)</p>
<p>Second, we have chosen to redact the other participant‚Äôs name.  While it is one
thing to speak in our own words of his successes and failures in healing
alongside with survivors, it is our fear that others will use his name with
words that are not ours ‚Äî that is, not survivor-led ‚Äî in ways that might damage
his capabilities for further healing and remediation.  It is our hope to work
with him to combat the ongoing damages of our patriarchal society, our systems
entrenched with and built around (trans)misogyny, and to build entirely new
systems and spaces for community interaction which prevent what we have survived
from occuring in the&nbsp;future.</p>
