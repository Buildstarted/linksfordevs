It’s a good product but even in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.ailon.org/jabra-elite-65t-and-true-wireless-headphones-as-a-category-b5295dafafbf">my initial review</a> I was a bit skeptical of the whole “true wireless” concept.</p><p id="6caf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Some weeks ago one of the earbuds started acting out and I had to send them for repair. I tried to use a “true” wired pair in the meantime but realized quite quickly that I am too spoiled with not being tethered to my phone. So I looked for a pair of Bluetooth earbuds that would alleviate the problems with both fully wired and true wireless earbuds.</p><p id="eb11" data-selectable-paragraph="">After a quick and non-exhaustive research my choice fell on <a href="https://amzn.to/3h5zOkj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony WI-C310 earbuds</a>. They aren’t flawless but I’m quite sure I’m not switching back to Jabras when I get them repaired. Here’s why…</p><p id="12d1" data-selectable-paragraph="">(as represented by Sony WI-C310 and Jabra Elite 65t)</p><ol><li id="adeb" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Comfort</strong>. True-wireless earbuds have to pack everything into the earpieces — speakers, microphones, batteries, controls. This automatically makes them bulkier and less comfortable. Jabra Elite 65t are fine for an hour of listening but after that I usually needed a break. The Sony set I got is very comfortable and you can definitely forget about them for a long period of time. One of the reasons I chose this Sony model is that it has these battery/controls blocks in the “right” and symmetrical locations on the cord. My previous corded Bluetooth earbuds weren’t as well-balanced and this was one of the main reasons I went for true wireless.</li><li id="38f3" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Battery life</strong>. True-wireless headphones can claim long battery life thanks to recharging in their cases. While 5 hours of uninterrupted use is fine for commute, it clearly disqualified them from being my main all-day set. Though my ears wouldn’t be able to tolerate them all day anyway. Sony C310 last for 15 hours without a recharge.</li><li id="baa5" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Use any earbud at a time</strong>. My biggest disappointment with Elite 65t was that you can only use the right earbud independently. This is only useful when you need to hear with the other ear but doesn’t allow you to recharge earbuds one at a time. And it doesn’t look like this was “fixed” with the new <a href="https://amzn.to/3cHR7ED" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elite 75t</a>. No such problem with “classic” earbuds. And, yes, I know that not all true-wireless earbuds have this problem but many do.</li><li id="7af3" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Can’t lose one earbud</strong>. Losing one true wireless earbud is a very common mishap for their owners. I managed not to lose any but definitely had to catch one falling more than once. Can’t happen with connected earbuds.</li><li id="072e" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Sound quality-to-price ratio</strong>. In my specific case, the list price difference is about 5x and for 20% of the true-wireless price I got a better sound quality. In all fairness, microphone quality on Jabras is definitely much better but not a priority for me personally.</li><li id="48c7" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Signal quality</strong>. Bluetooth signal stability on Jabras is fine but, probably, since it’s a more complicated tech to send and sync the signal between two earbuds I’ve had a few frames drop out here and there all the time. I haven’t lost a single frame in a week of using Sonys so far.</li></ol><p id="1418" data-selectable-paragraph="">(as represented by the same Sony WI-C310 and Jabra Elite 65t)</p><ol><li id="340b" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Pausing when earbud is pulled out</strong>. This was very useful when interrupted by someone or something. On the other hand, you had to hold that earbud in your hand or put it somewhere when not in the ear. I suppose more advanced “classic” Bluetooth earbuds can do this too.</li><li id="8968" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Switching on when taken out of the case</strong>. All of this week with the Sonys I wondered why the earbuds still aren’t connected to the phone when I already put them into my ears. Turns out you have to press a button to turn them on :) Got used to not having to do this with Jabra. It’s no biggie but still was a nice feature to have. Same goes for switching off. With 15 hours of battery life I don’t really need the charging case, but auto switching on and off it enabled was great.</li><li id="ef70" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Controls on the earbuds</strong>. This is not as cut-and-dry because it’s probably impossible to implement while still preserving the level of comfort I have now. But it was definitely more convenient than looking for the control block on the cord.</li><li id="922b" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Wardrobe independence</strong>. It’s not an issue right now but come winter, I imagine dealing with the wire is going to be a bit of a problem. On the other hand, putting a hat on and taking it off was a major risk of dropping an earbud (or both).</li></ol><p id="80d0" data-selectable-paragraph="">I realize that not all true wireless earbuds were born equal and same applies to the “classic” ones but considering that Jabra Elite 65t is one of the best regarded products in the true wireless category and the “classic” Sony I got was fairly random, quick and inexpensive choice, I imagine my impressions could have been even more skewed towards the “non-true wireless” choice.</p><p id="6b98" data-selectable-paragraph="">Overall, I’m still under impression that true wireless headphones create more problems than they solve and the only reason to get them over a “classic” counterpart is some sort of peer pressure or “prestige”. If that’s not a factor for you, just get a good pair of classic Bluetooth earbuds and enjoy a much better bang for your buck.</p><h2 id="6eb5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Product links:</h2><ul><li id="3f91" data-selectable-paragraph=""><a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/in-ear-headphones/wi-c310" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony WI-C310 official page</a></li><li id="e3e1" data-selectable-paragraph=""><a href="https://amzn.to/3h5zOkj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony WI-C310 on Amazon</a></li><li id="8419" data-selectable-paragraph=""><a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/in-ear-headphones/wi-c310" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jabra Elite 65t official page</a></li><li id="ef27" data-selectable-paragraph=""><a href="https://amzn.to/3eUwTcm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jabra Elite 65t on Amazon</a></li><li id="cc51" data-selectable-paragraph=""><a href="https://amzn.to/3cHR7ED" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jabra Elite 75t on Amazon</a></li></ul></div></div></section></div></div></div>
