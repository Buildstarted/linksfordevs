    <h1>Announcing .NET Jupyter Notebooks | Hacker News</h1>
    <div class="commtext">I like Observable for sharing JS tutorials - was just updating <a href="https://observablehq.com/@lmeyerov/manipulating-flat-arrays-arrow-style">https://observablehq.com/@lmeyerov/manipulating-flat-arrays-...</a> today.<p>Observable does some things quite well for that use case:</p><p>-- Easier dependencies: no need for &apos;npm install&apos;, just &apos;require(...)&apos;</p><p>-- URL publishing</p><p>-- Collaborative merge flow</p><p>However, Jupyter made some good decisions that make it win over Observable for our day-to-day data work:</p><p>-- Manual reexecution vs. automatic: when working with big data, outside APIs, etc., Observable&apos;s automatic reexecution is a non-starter</p><p>-- Fully open source, embeddable, and successful history of non-vc funding: Jupyter is organized and provided in a way companies ( who aren&apos;t Amazon ;-)) can rally around, evidenced by contributions by Bloomberg etc.</p><p>-- Access to underlying unix/windows env and multiple environments (multiple Python versions, ...). As much as I wish Observable&apos;s choice of JS could provide a viable data environment, and I&apos;ve personally invested in making it so and the path to making it first-class is clear, we need way more gov/google/nvidia/etc. support.</p><p>Ultimately, for not-too-sensitive collaborative data work, we use Google Colab, then offline and sensitive commercial work via Jupyter (Graphistry ships with it preloaded for GPU dataframe &amp; GPU visual graph analytics goodness!), and if we did more in JS tutorial land, Observable would be my first choice.</p></div>
