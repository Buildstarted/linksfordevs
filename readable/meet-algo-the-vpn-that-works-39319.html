	<div>
		<p>I think youâ€™ll agree when I say: thereâ€™s no VPN option on the market designed with equal emphasis on security and ease of use.</p>
<p>That changes now.</p>
<p><span>Today weâ€™re introducing <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/algo">Algo</a>, a self-hosted personal VPN server designed for ease of deployment and security.</span>&nbsp;<span>Algo automatically deploys an on-demand VPN service in the cloud that is not shared with other users, relies on only modern protocols and ciphers, and includes only the minimal software you need.</span></p>
<p>And itâ€™s free.</p>
<p>For anyone who is privacy conscious, travels for work frequently, or canâ€™t afford a dedicated IT department, this oneâ€™s for you.</p>
<h2>Donâ€™t bother with commercial VPNs</h2>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/kennwhite/1f3bc4d889b02b35d8aa">Theyâ€™re crap</a>.</p>
<p>Really, the paid-for services are just commercial honeypots. If an attacker can compromise a VPN provider, they can monitor a whole lot of sensitive data.</p>
<p>Paid-for VPNs tend to be insecure: they share keys, their weak cryptography gives a false sense of security, and they require you to trust their operators.</p>
<p>Even if youâ€™re not doing anything wrong, you could be sharing the same endpoint with someone who is. In that case, your network traffic will be analyzed when law enforcement makes that <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/police-seize-two-perfect-privacy-vpn-servers-160902/">seizure</a>.</p>
<h2>Streisand is no better</h2>
<p>Good concept. Poor implementation.</p>
<p>It installs ~40 services, including numerous remote access services, a Tor relay&nbsp;node, and out-of-date software. It leaves you with dozens of keys to manage and it allows weak crypto.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s a hefty footprint&nbsp;and itâ€™s too complicated for any reasonable person to secure. If you set up an individual server just for yourself, youâ€™d never know if or when an attacker compromised it.</p>
<h2>OpenVPN:&nbsp;Requires client software</h2>
<p>OpenVPNâ€™s lack of out-of-the-box client support on any major desktop or mobile operating system introduces unnecessary complexity. The user experience suffers.</p>
<p>Speaking of users, theyâ€™re required to <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34037/">update</a> and <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/20485/">maintain</a> this software too. That is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Worst of all, OpenVPN depends on the security of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7457">TLS</a>, both the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/new-attack-can-pluck-secrets-from-1-of-https-traffic-affects-top-sites/">protocol</a> and its <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/04/confirmed-nasty-heartbleed-bug-exposes-openvpn-private-keys-too/">implementations</a>. Between that, and past <a href="https://github.com/ValdikSS/openvpn-fix-dns-leak-plugin/blob/master/README.md">security</a> <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34879/">incidents</a>, we simply trust it less.</p>
<h2>Other VPNsâ€™ S/WAN song</h2>
<p>The original attempt at free VPN software -FreeS/WAN- died in the early 2000â€™s when its dev team fractured. Three people forked it into LibreSwan, strongSwan and Openswan.</p>
<p>To use any of them today, you need something approaching tribal knowledge. The available documentation stymied and appalled us:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Little differentiation</strong> â€“ If you search for information about strongSwanâ€™s configuration, you could easily end up at a LibreSwan page. The terms will look familiar, but the instructions will be wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Impenetrable language</strong> â€“ Instead of using standard terms like â€˜client, server, remote and local,â€™ they use â€˜sun, moon, bob, carol,â€™ and a bunch of other arbitrary words.</li>
<li><strong>Brittle methodology</strong> â€“ The vast majority of documentation and guides&nbsp;insist on using â€˜tried and trueâ€™ methods such as L2TP and IKEv1, even though IKEv2 is simpler and stronger. Since Apple added IKEv2 to iOS 8, thereâ€™s no reason not to use it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Only the strongest S/WAN survived</h2>
<p>After wading through the convoluted quagmire that is the S/WAN triplets, we settled on strongSwan.</p>
<p>Its documentation -such as it is- is the best of the bunch. It was rewritten recently from scratch to support IKEv2 (a positive step when supporting a major new protocol version). Itâ€™s the only IPSEC software that even offers the option for a trusted key store.</p>
<p>And the community is helpful. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/thermi">Thermi</a>.</p>
<p>But itâ€™s still super-complicated. Too many contributors made it very arcane. Again, you need that tribal knowledge to make IPSEC do what you want.</p>
<p>These are examples of why cryptography software has a well-earned reputation for poor usability. A tightly knit development community only communicating with itself tends to lead to a profusion of options that should be deprecated. Thereâ€™s no sign that the user interface or experience has been reviewed on behalf of less-experienced users. For anyone bold enough to consider these points, here lies the path to widespread adoption.</p>
<h2>So, we built Algo</h2>

<p><span>Algo is a set of Ansible scripts that simplifies the setup of a personal IPSEC VPN. It contains the most secure defaults available, works with common cloud providers, and does not require client software on most devices.</span></p>
<p>The â€˜<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnFJ8cHAlco">VP of all Networks</a>â€™ is strong, secure and tidy. It uses the least amount of software necessary to get the job done.</p>
<p>We made Algo with corporate travelers in mind. To save bandwidth and increase security, it blocks ads and compresses whatâ€™s left.</p>
<p><span>We shared an early version of Algo at Black Hat this year and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/rantyben/status/759523279526699008"><span>people</span></a><a href="https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/786248285165981696"><span> loved it</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<h3>Designed to be disposable</h3>
<p>We wanted Algo to be easy to set up. That way, you start it when&nbsp;you need it, and tear it down before anyone can figure out the service youâ€™re routing your traffic through.</p>
<p>Setup is automated. Just answer a few questions, and Algo will build your VPN for you.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve automated the setup process for Apple devices, too. Algo just gives you a file that you AirDrop to your device. You press â€˜installâ€™ and youâ€™ve got your VPN. Or â€˜VPNs.â€™</p>
<p>You donâ€™t have to choose just one VPN gateway. You could make yourself 20 on different services; Digital Ocean in Bangalore, EC2 in Virginia or any other combination. You have your choice.</p>

<p>One last reason that Algo is such a good solution: itâ€™s been abstracted as a set of Ansible roles that we released to the community. Ansible provides clearer documentation, ensures that we can repeat what it is that weâ€™re doing, and allows us to monitor configuration drift.</p>
<p>Thanks to the roles we created in Ansible, itâ€™s very easy for us to add and refine different features independently. Members of&nbsp;our team&nbsp;will keep up on feature requests.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ll make sure itâ€™s right. You can just use it.</p>

<h3>Want help installing Algo?</h3>
<p>Weâ€™re planning a virtual crypto party for Friday, December 16th at 3pm EST where weâ€™ll walk you through installing Algo on their own. <a href="https://trailofbits.wufoo.com/forms/signup-for-the-algo-vpn-crypto-party/">Register to join us</a>.</p>
