	Quick Take
</p><div data-index="2"><p>A Monaco, in Monaco, on the Monaco's 50th birthday. As this year marks the 50th anniversary of TAG Heuer's iconic Monaco, the company has selected the Formula 1 Monaco Grand Prix to kick off a proper celebration of their distinctive and much-loved square watch. Unveiled in the locale of its naming, the new Monaco 1969-1979 Limited Edition is the first of five collector-focused limited editions that will pay tribute to the Monaco and its charming, oddball history.&nbsp;</p></div><div data-index="3"><p>As the first of these limited editions, the Monaco 1969-1979 LE is limited to 169 units, and calls backs to the Monaco's first decade of existence. With a warm green dial, grey sub-dials, reddish-brown hands, and yellow dial accents, this 39mm steel Monaco definitely has a 1970s color palette, while retaining the quirky motorsports-inspired design language that helped set the Monaco apart from its peers.&nbsp;</p></div><p class="headline headline-h3">
	Initial Thoughts
</p><div data-index="6"><p>While some of the images I first saw gave the dial a very flat effect, the green/brown coloring is highlighted by vertical <i>Côtes de Genève</i> finishing that adds a great deal of depth and detail in the metal. Likewise, the dial is quite colorful, with green, browns and yellow highlights surrounding the distinctive square sub-dials. Legibility is excellent, as is typical for the Monaco. The red central chronograph seconds hand reaches all the way to the markers, and there is a bright white date display &nbsp;at six o'clock. All in all, this new Monaco has a colorful palette straight from the '70s, as it looks back at the birth of its own legacy.&nbsp;</p></div><div data-index="9"><p>True to its roots, the Monaco 1969-1979 Limited Edition is powered by the TAG Heuer Calibre 11, an automatic chronograph movement that runs at 4 Hz, offers 40 hours of power reserve, and has a maximum chronograph measure of 30 minutes. With its easily recognized square case and a history that is intertwined with golden eras for both Heuer and motorsports (not to mention the iconography of the '70s), the Monaco 1969-1979 Limited Edition is full of funky charm, and we're looking forward to the release of the next LE in this five-part series. Happy 50th, Monaco (from Monaco).&nbsp;</p></div><hr class="headline-hr">
