									<p><em>This is an unusually lengthy essay, because the issue is so complex and nuanced that it deserves an appropriate level of patience and attention. It includes my deeply honest, personal, and some would say risky perspective on the topic of diversity in high-performance careers, including tech entrepreneurship; and my concern that the decision by some to “weaponize” diversity is backfiring and causing harm to under-represented minority groups.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I grew up in a very “colorful” part of Northside Houston, with neighbors and schoolmates who were usually a mix of latino (immigrants and 2nd generation), black, asian and white; and a general socioeconomic range hovering between welfare, blue collar, and sort-of-middle class. My parents (Mexican immigrants) started a produce business selling avocados and tomatoes out of a pickup truck, that eventually grew but then unfortunately imploded. By the time I was sending off college applications, my two sisters and I were supported by our single mother who sold perfumes at an indoor flea market. I ended up attending the University of Texas and Harvard Law School. Today, with three healthy kids, happily married over a decade and a successful legal practice/leadership position at an elite boutique law firm, my cozy “1%” life definitely does <em>not</em> suck.</p>
<p>But this isn’t your classic “American Dream” “Rags to Riches” “look at how awesome I am for everything I’ve overcome <em>on my own</em>” story. There’s a key twist, and that twist has given me a unique perspective on issues of socioeconomic inequality, diversity, and also mental health. My mother, despite ending up in a struggling, unstable situation, was actually a top computer science graduate of the most elite technology university in Mexico; the Tecnologico de Monterrey. Basically the MIT of Mexico. And&nbsp;<em>her</em> family pedigree includes a nationally celebrated Mexican artist and a biological (but estranged) father considered one of the top Medical doctors and Medical School professors in his field.</p>
<p>How did my mom go from an MIT-equivalent grad with a strong family background to selling perfumes at a flea market as a single mom hovering preciously close to Medicaid-level poverty? This isn’t my autobiography, so I’ll cut that part of the story short and summarize: mental illness. Many people fail to appreciate how success is just as much about emotional intelligence/stability as it is about intellectual/analytical capacity, and the formula for producing the former is often far more complex/nuanced than what’s necessary for the latter.</p>
<p>I mentioned these details about my mother because they are historical elements that keep me, if I’m honest, from painting for you a perfect “picked myself up by nothing but my bootstraps” story. My mother’s emphasis on academics and her love of computers – which she made every effort to expose me to, within her limited means – were key strategic assets in my childhood that differentiated me from my peer group, and undoubtedly propelled me forward. The truth is the <em>vast</em> majority of people who give you these “rags to riches” stories can, if they’re sincere enough, come up with their own kinds of privilege that they depended on growing up. If anything, simply being born “gifted” (to use a very broad but frequently used term) is itself an unearned privilege reserved for a lucky few who often like to conveniently overlook their luck.</p>
<p>Yes, we were poor latinos living in a low-income area and a broken home, speaking a blend of spanish and english and having our fair share of tamales, frijoles, barbacoa, etc. etc… but as it related to school, my “home culture” was different. I studied. Hard. With a level of discipline that got me labeled as “acting white” (by other latinos) more than enough times. There was even a special term for it: “coconut.” Brown on the outside, white on the inside.</p>
<p>Very very few of my latino friends growing up have ended up as successful doctors, lawyers, engineers, executives, or entrepreneurs. Many of them didn’t even go to college. Whenever I hear someone bring up statistics about the under-representation of latinos among the “elite” economic strata in the U.S., I think about my childhood experiences. I think about how differently I saw the world from my friends, because of the expectations I had at home; my “coconut” expectations.</p>
<p>I think about how often I heard, and sometimes still hear, underachieving peers lash out at the world for its racism and prejudice against latinos; and yet, with a name like Jose, there was no “hiding” my own ethnicity. If the world I was living in had deep,&nbsp;<em>systemic</em> discrimination against latinos, surely I was an easy target. And yet here I am. Certainly I’ve encountered some bona fide racists, but rarely were they in positions of influence to alter my trajectory. And of course there are stereotypes that I’ve had to overcome. But, again, given the progressiveness and merit-driven nature of the people and institutions of influence I’ve encountered (and thank God for that), the stereotypes eventually gave way to what I could <em>actually</em> deliver.</p>
<p>I’ve learned to not be so offended by weak stereotypes, because given my experiences growing up, I understand full well why they exist. Stereotyping is at some level a normal, even if often unfortunate, function of human behavior. We had plenty of stereotype jokes in our household growing up, particularly about white people. Stereotypes alone do not really make you a racist. They make you human. It’s how strongly you hold onto a stereotype, and your willingness to give individuals the benefit of the doubt, that determines whether or not you deserve the label. By all means push back hard against assholes. But first, don’t jump to unproductive (for you) and incorrect conclusions about how many people out there really are assholes.</p>
<p>But let’s jump back to the unfortunate above-mentioned fact: very few of my latino friends ended up successful. Why? Racism? Systemic discrimination? I’m sorry, but you won’t convince me of that. I will acknowledge that stereotypes are out there, and they do impact latinos at the margins, but my own experiences, observations, and reflections make it impossible for me to accept that the <em>dramatic</em> under-representation of latinos in high-performance industries <em>today&nbsp;</em>is the result of them being&nbsp;<em>discriminated</em> against. The gap is simply too large, and many of these industries are simply too competitive and lucrative for key players to ignore truly untapped talent being kept on the sidelines.</p>
<p>If you want to argue for strong, systemic discrimination against latinos, you’ll have to explain the very big gaps in outcomes between, say, Cubans and Mexicans. A reflective and honest latino can explain that gap very quickly. Cuba had a “brain drain” thanks to Castro. Mexico did not. Every major country has different strata with their own subcultures and attitudes, including about education, work, family building, and many other life factors. “Mexicans” certainly share a common culture, but a Mexican banker or professor has a <em>very</em> different attitude toward education than a Mexican laborer or restaurant owner. History and geography have caused Cuban immigration to the United States to <em>select</em> more for Cubans with values that help them succeed at higher levels of performance in an education and capitalism driven society, while Mexicans with similar values have disproportionately chosen to “stay home,” with their much more blue collar counterparts (with a far less positive attitude toward academics) leaving to America.</p>
<p>You see this issue pop up between black Americans of recent African descent – like Nigerians and Ghanaians – relative to African-Americans with lengthy American histories, including with slavery. Nigerian and Ghanaian Americans, and their children, are&nbsp;<em>far</em> more economically successful on average than other black Americans, including by some measures more successful than average white Americans. But just like Cubans and Mexicans, they&nbsp;<em>look</em> exactly the same. Clearly this&nbsp;<em>systemic</em> discrimination narrative is more complex than some make it out to be. Immigration patterns have generated a “brain drain” from various African countries that&nbsp;<i>selects&nbsp;</i>for members of those populations with values that generate more positive outcomes.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t to pretend that the selection process of differential migration&nbsp;<i>alone</i> explains the full outcomes of different groups. Confucianism goes a&nbsp;<i>long&nbsp;</i>way in explaining why certain “Asian” cultures are obsessive about academic achievement for their children. China <em>broadly</em> cares a whole lot more about school performance than Mexico does.&nbsp;Talmudic history similarly explains the strong outcomes of Jews. Explaining Mormons is a little more complicated. But the general message is centuries of distinct history produce distinct cultures with distinct values that generate distinct kinds of performance in distinct environments. How many elite Chinese-American baseball players are you aware of? Culture matters. A lot.</p>
<p>So why&nbsp;<em>is</em> there such a disproportionately small number of American latinos in elite careers? To give a full answer, it would take a day’s worth of conversations, and hours of writing. On a socioeconomic level, latinos in America obviously face barriers like higher amounts of poverty, poor schools, cramped housing, and all the challenges of being in the lower economic brackets typically reserved for recent immigrants. Regardless of what minority group you are talking about, these factors push down long-term performance. Yet the data unavoidably shows that, even when controlling for socioeconomic barriers, certain groups still dramatically outperform others on long-term economic outcomes.</p>
<p>To ignore the reality of cultural values is to cowardly stick your head in the sand, and therefore never fully address the issue. American Latino culture (generally) heavily promotes short-term economic gain over the kind of long-term success requiring what’s often called “delayed gratification.” If you find a decent job right outside of high school, and even during high school, that can afford you a relatively nice car and possibly a modest home, your “network” as a latino is far more likely to celebrate your achievement. If you grind out your high school years acing AP classes, forgoing short-term economic opportunities, in hopes of getting a BA and even a masters degree, you’re more likely to be called a coconut.</p>
<p>American Latino culture (specifically the culture of the strata of latinos <em>who come to America</em>, which is very different from “Latin American” culture generally), for all of the above-covered reasons having to do with history and immigration selection, disproportionately prioritizes blue collar and middle-class success over the long-term delayed training required to reach the upper tiers of high-performance professions. Where are the millions of Mexican parents who demand academic excellence from their kids? Largely in Mexico, where they are successful and have no reason to leave.</p>
<p>High-performance professions, like law, engineering, and medicine, are heavily oriented toward the kinds of skills that depend on long-term, compounding training and achievement. Unlike, say, marketing or sales, where someone with a natural gift could&nbsp;<em>possibly</em> not do that well in K-12 and still quickly absorb necessary skills for high-performance post-school, it is&nbsp;<em>very</em> hard to make up, in a matter of a few months or even years, for extremely weak math and science training if you want to be an engineer or doctor.</p>
<p>Heaven knows many universities try (and bless them for it), but they simply cannot waive a magic wand and erase a poor public education and home environment (culture) that failed to instill academic rigor over the course of over a decade, including during a child’s most formative years. Think of what it takes to be a world class violinist. How many of them started training only when they got to university? Virtually none. How a child spends their time heavily influences the performance level they are able attain as an adult, especially in careers dependent on compounding skillsets.</p>
<p>Thus, these career tracks by their nature – a nature that has absolutely nothing to do with racial discrimination, mind you – heavily disfavor anyone who doesn’t show up to college with a relatively solid academic background. That means, disproportionately, American latinos (and also other subcultures, like, say, rural whites in Appalachia). To really address this problem requires a lengthy, candid discussion about childhood, parenting, family structure, and cultural identity. Calling “the system” racist gets you nowhere. Yes, certain groups do better than others in the system, but that’s generally because they better prepare children to meet the logical requirements of the system.</p>
<p>Now speaking even more narrowly for the audience that frequents this blog: why are there so few successful latino tech entrepreneurs? I’ve already explained&nbsp;<em>part</em> of the answer. As much as we celebrate people like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates dropping out of Harvard to start tech companies, it’s worth emphasizing that&nbsp;<em>first</em> they still got into Harvard, and&nbsp;<em>second</em> they surely must’ve learned the skills necessary to start&nbsp;<span>tech</span> companies somewhere before getting to Harvard. Tech entrepreneurship is dependent on a compounding skillset that, again, filters out people whose childhoods failed to help them develop that skillset. Zuck and Bill didn’t learn to code during their freshman years.</p>
<p>But let’s put aside the compounding/technical skill issue for a moment, because there’s a more nuanced issue at play here, and it relates to the point I made when discussing my mother’s poor outcome despite her clear academic intelligence: success depends on&nbsp;<em>technical</em> skill but also, particularly in certain environments, on <em>emotional/psychological</em> resilience.</p>
<p>There’s a frequently cited <del>Benjamin Franklin</del>&nbsp;John Adams line that I am totally going to botch (and somewhat modernize), but to paraphrase: people become farmers, so that <em>their</em> children can become merchants, so that <em>their</em> children can become professionals, so that <em>their</em> children can become artists and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>What is this line telling us? That there is often a&nbsp;<em>generational</em> progression to career trajectories, and that progression is tied to economic stability, which itself is tied to psychological resilience and willingness to take risk. I can tell you, having worked with and observed hundreds of entrepreneurial ventures, your&nbsp;<em>average</em> tech entrepreneur is not coming from a low-income or even blue collar/middle class background. Zuck and Bill certainly did not.</p>
<p>It often takes a childhood environment that infuses a person with confidence about their family/network’s overall economic stability to enable that person to confidently take the enormous personal risk of becoming an entrepreneur; instead of going into a nicely salaried career. Wealthy kids are&nbsp;<em>far</em> more likely to grow up to become entrepreneurs, because they know that going “bust” doesn’t mean actually going homeless, but instead there’s an enormous set of resources there to serve as a parachute. &nbsp;Kids with similar technical or “intellectual” ability, but with families living on the precipice of poverty, or at least with very few excess resources to manage a blowup, do not have that luxury.</p>
<p>This is&nbsp;<em>not</em> to say that tech entrepreneurs with wealthy backgrounds are not big risk takers. Most of their equally wealthy friends probably still went into consulting and other salaried jobs. But it is to at least&nbsp;<em>acknowledge</em> that having an affluent background dramatically subsidizes personal risk tolerance.</p>
<p>I do not regret&nbsp;<em>for a second</em> becoming a VC lawyer instead of becoming an entrepreneur. Neither of my parents had any substantial savings. In fact, I support my mother in her retirement, and most of the rest of my family struggles on a daily basis to even stay in the middle class (loosely defined). Unlike Zuck or Bill, failure in my case would’ve, quite literally, risked homelessness. I have met entrepreneurs who really did risk homelessness/poverty in starting their entrepreneurial ventures, but they are a far smaller minority than is suggested from the heroic “risk absolutely everything” stories one often hears in the media.</p>
<p>So I went into a career that made sense for&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;low-income family background/history. No regrets. I can guarantee you countless high-achieving latinos (and other minorities) make this exact decision on a daily basis. Startup? Sorry, I’ve got parents and other extended family to help out. I’ll take that high-salaried job I busted my ass and sacrificed for. Maybe my kids will have a better parachute.</p>
<p>Many high-achieving minorities simply do not have the luxury of parents, aunts, uncles, cousins all with stable incomes and savings to provide them a parachute for an entrepreneurial adventure. Now,&nbsp;<i>their kids</i> might (see the John Adams line), but that’s why changing the long-term economic success of any broad group simply cannot be wished into existence. The most challenging forms of success take an entire childhood of compounding learning, and going even further, the very highest risk paths often take&nbsp;<em>generational</em> building of wealth and resilience.</p>
<p>So, first, the&nbsp;<em>compounding technical skill</em> “filter” disproportionately impacts latinos (and similar groups) because cultural, not just socioeconomic, factors lead fewer of them to develop the compounding skills in childhood that make tech entrepreneurship feasible. Second, for the disproportionately small number of them who still end up getting there, they are&nbsp;<em>far</em> less likely than other groups to come from the kinds of stable economic backgrounds that make high-risk paths like entrepreneurship attractive. Now, let’s ask ourselves a hard question. How much of this unfortunate reality can&nbsp;<em>actually</em> be materially impacted by recruiters and investors in any short-term sense?</p>
<p>It takes&nbsp;<em>time</em> for the descendants of low-income immigrants to build the kind of economic stability and resilience that encourages very high-risk, very high-reward paths. Anyone expecting to&nbsp;<em>actually</em> impact long-term collective outcomes needs to face, head on and without unproductive outrage or finger-pointing, the fact that helping people meet the requirements of high-performance&nbsp;takes&nbsp;time. It also takes honesty about the cultural/behavioral values that build up children to face those requirements as adults.&nbsp;The requirements themselves, no matter how much we might wish otherwise, are not going to budge.</p>
<p>We like to think of entrepreneurship, including tech entrepreneurship, as a very democratizing, equalizing playing field where anyone with the right motivation and persistence can succeed; but my honest experience is that today, in fact, it’s the opposite. High-achieving entrepreneurship takes a spectacularly rare and complex combination of analytical and technical skills, communication skills, social skills, and creative judgment about current and changing market conditions, on top of incredible psychological resilience. Rather than an easily accessible field for anyone who wants to play, modern hyper-competitive entrepreneurship represents the apex of human abilities, creativity, and endurance. We should not be surprised that, for most people, the necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for reaching that apex start well before adulthood; and include a childhood environment that supports high achievement.</p>
<p>Tying this all together: I want to see more “people of color” in tech entrepreneurship and other high-performance careers just like all other good, honest, progressive people. But I’m afraid that a segment of the community – either well-intentioned or not – has chosen to&nbsp;<em>weaponize</em> the issue of diversity in a way that is not only hostile and disingenuous, but counterproductive to its own cause.</p>
<p>There are historical, cultural, and socioeconomic reasons – all of which have been exhaustively studied – that explain why a disproportionately small number of people in certain ethnic/minority groups are able to achieve the high levels of performance and economic success attained by other groups. The number of high-performing “candidates” of color, in the sense we are discussing, is&nbsp;<em>in fact</em> smaller. Throwing the label “racist” around indiscriminately, and trying to guilt decision makers – like recruiters and investors – into hiring or investing in&nbsp;more of these candidates than <em>realistically</em> exist (today) can backfire. Dramatically. I’ve seen it happen.</p>
<p>I’ve seen very well-intentioned “diversity” accelerators created with much fan-fare and PR. But because they didn’t actually dig into the deep, complex reasons for the low representation of certain groups in their industry, and instead wanted quick and easy results, what&nbsp;<em>actually</em> ended up happening is that they promoted companies that underperformed and underachieved. The end-result? They very loudly and publicly reinforced the very stereotypes they were trying to break. Even more sadly, already successful/wealthy people, usually white, still get their PR and photo ops from these initiatives, while minorities are, once again, left holding an empty bag. On the most important issues, good intentions are not enough.</p>
<p>The more exposed any position is to the harsh, unforgiving reality of the market, the harder it is to compensate for underperformance. This is why large organizations, like the government (including the military) have historically been the best environments for “affirmative action” type initiatives that acknowledged&nbsp;<em>some</em> preferential treatment of under-represented minorities, but are able to contain and address any performance issues with the “slack” of the large organization. Very high-performance, high-stakes positions, like startup entrepreneurship (and also complex law, by the way) unfortunately don’t have this luxury. If there are nuanced, complex reasons for why a disproportionately small number of latinos meet the requirements of medical schools, I doubt anyone wants to suggest we guilt and shame the schools into graduating more of them anyway.</p>
<p>Promoting diversity is an extremely noble and good goal. I support it. Wholeheartedly. But for the love of God, let’s please be&nbsp;<em>honest,&nbsp;</em><em>decent</em>, and <em>smart</em> about it. If we’re&nbsp;<em>honest</em>, we’ll first acknowledge all of the nuances and complexities – some of them clearly uncomfortable – about the background sources of the problem. We’ll also acknowledge that extremely competitive industries – like venture capital – are&nbsp;<em>heavily&nbsp;</em>incentivized to look for and exploit “undervalued” talent. Literally hundreds of funds, many of them led by people <em>hardly</em> from the kinds of backwater places simmering with racism,&nbsp;are all competing to the death to find successes. If they&nbsp;<em>still</em> are not substantially moving the needle on finding numerous tech ventures led by teams of underrepresented color capable of generating venture returns, maybe racism isn’t the real problem.</p>
<p>Second, if we’re&nbsp;<em>decent</em> about it, we will not play this unfair game of simply looking at a team or portfolio, finding that there’s no one “of color” on it, and throwing a racist label at someone. We will stop&nbsp;<em>weaponizing</em> diversity. Many recruiters in certain high-performance industries&nbsp;<em>know</em>&nbsp;how much extra effort it can take to find truly high-performing “diverse” candidates. It is&nbsp;<em>not</em> because they do not exist. It is because they, for all of the discussed reasons, are in shorter supply; and because they are in shorter supply, they get taken up by employers with the best brands and compensation packages. When a particular A-level firm – whether it’s a law firm or a venture capital firm – loudly promotes their “diverse” roster, it does <em>not</em> mean every company with less “diverse” rosters is full of racists. It means that in a market increasingly looking for these scarcer candidates, those with the most “pull” (better brand, better pay, lower risk) are able to win, and those with less pull lose. In many cases “inclusiveness” has absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Similarly, the weaponization (and in some cases monetization) of diversity heavily incentivizes “tokenism.” As long as I can secure enough people who, from outer appearances, check the “diverse” box, I can move on and totally avoid actually addressing the&nbsp;systemic issues that demonstrably disadvantage certain people over others. For example, many elite universities are <em>full</em>&nbsp;of latinos who are the children of doctors, lawyers, and executives, from stable homes and private prep schools. Are these really the “diverse” candidates we want to pour substantial resources into helping? Does a Jose who summers in the Hamptons and got a BMW for his 16th birthday bring “color” to your workplace in the way diversity initiatives intend? Maybe. But if that’s what we really want, let’s be honest and open about it. Filling your workplace or portfolio with people from objectively affluent and privileged backgrounds, who nevertheless have the right names or skin tones, feels different to some of us than really putting in effort to level the playing field for people facing real structural barriers.</p>
<p>Finally, if we’re&nbsp;<em>smart</em> about diversity in high-performance areas, we’ll acknowledge how important patience is. Instead of pretending that a few well-intentioned initiatives are going to suddenly erase decades and even generations of differences with compounding effects, we’ll start going after long-term policies that will&nbsp;<em>really</em> change the landscape. Policies like:</p>
<p>-equalized public school funding and school choice<br>
-criminal justice reform<br>
-public funding for healthcare, including mental healthcare<br>
-social and economic support initiatives</p>
<p>Recklessly and indiscriminately warmongering over diversity is the business world’s equivalent of breaking windows and looting. The anger and frustration over the slow pace of results are understandable and worthy of empathy. And yet angrily pointing fingers at people who are sincerely trying to improve an issue that they really did not cause, and in truth are very limited in their ability to quickly fix, is counterproductive. If we push them to promote candidates who truly are not ready, the resulting underperformance will not only ruin the confidence of people who otherwise might’ve had very positive outcomes in a more appropriate environment, but it will also harden stereotypes that we should instead be, strategically, weakening.</p>
<p>I’m thankful every day that the decision-makers I encountered throughout my life didn’t see “a latino.” They didn’t see a stereotype to be quickly discarded, nor a token to be pushed in directions driven by a political agenda. They saw Jose Ancer, a specific kid with some challenges but also some abilities; and gave me a shot at showing what I could legitimately deliver within the background and life I was <em>actually</em> living. We should want nothing less for every single child that enters the school system, and adult that enters the market. How many individual people are we failing to objectively help, because we are paralyzed by grand theories chasing rushed collective goals that have never been feasible on any short timeline?</p>
<p>Results over misdirected rage. Equal opportunity over unrealistic expectations of quickly equal outcomes. But getting there requires all of us to talk honestly, empathetically, and carefully about the real issues, without demonizing those who sincerely feel like we are spinning our wheels. That’s the only way we will finally get past the anger and frustration that understandably result from misguided quick fixes that ignore the complexity and depth of the challenges.</p>
<p>In my case – I want to see, on top of the public policies that directly address the social and economic challenges of poverty in America, an environment in which every young latino can throw him or herself into whatever subject they want, and make long-term sacrifices to succeed, without facing labels like “coconut” or other counterproductive messaging <em>from other latinos&nbsp;</em>that children from other ethnic backgrounds simply never have to face. Of course, let’s ensure we’re rooting out whatever racism and discrimination that exists. But let’s also not deny the personal responsibility necessary in our own communities to build new identities that no longer force any child to choose between high achievement and culture.</p>
<p>The evidence is abundantly clear that no amount of public policy or reconciliation over historical injustices will ever replace the profound, long-lasting impact of private household cultural values, including about education and long-term training, on the performance level children are able to reach as adults. Sometimes the very hardest problems are the ones that no one else can fully solve for us. Yet at the same time, there can be hope in realizing that many of the long-term solutions are much more in our control, and we don’t have to wait for outsider heroes to be our saviors.</p>
<p>On a closing note, I was careful to keep this discussion personal, and about my own experiences as a latino. I don’t pretend to speak in any way for other minority groups; and certainly not for the black community, which has faced a very different, and legitimately harsher historical reality in America. I cannot pretend to know what it is like to be a black American, or to fully understand the incredibly justifiable outrage sparked by George Floyd’s murder. I do hope, however, that some of my thoughts might be helpful for other people of color to assess and chart their own paths on the issue of diversity, and what changes they hope to effect in the market. Anger and frustration can be fuel for enormously productive action, but only if we channel them in ways that truly hit the source of a problem; even if that source is more complex and uncomfortable, and less responsive to simplistic outrage and politicization, than we want to admit.</p>
