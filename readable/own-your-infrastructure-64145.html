<p>Like many in the software development industry, I find <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> to be an
amazing product. It was so ahead of everything else at the time, it was
unbelievable. It certainly made things a lot easier for me when I was starting
out as a developer by letting me avoid all the pains of handling servers.
Clients appreciated it and I had no worries that something would go down.
Managing deployments manually was tough, and still is. That
is if you don’t containerize your code with <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a> or the likes of
it.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not a professional DevOps guy. That is I don’t do it as a full-time
job. However, I had to set up things too many times at this point not to know
those different situations, team sizes, and tech stacks require different tools.</p>
<p>Worth noting that by <em>developers</em> in this piece I primarily mean solo
developers. Bigger teams require a different approach. Most early startups
would fall into solo developer category though.</p>
<h3 id="dokku">Dokku</h3>
<p>When people grow out of <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, the first thing they usually find is
<a href="https://github.com/dokku/dokku">Dokku</a>. It’s a simple way to manage Docker containers without messing
with more complex configurations, and it’s more than enough for most solo
developers as the majority of apps and websites don’t get enough traffic for it
not to enough.</p>
<p>A few steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>getting a server from Digital Ocean, Linode or AWS;</li>
<li>initial set up of said server;</li>
<li>one simple script from the Dokku website;</li>
<li>in your repo: <code>git remote add dokku $server</code>;</li>
<li>when deploying: <code>git push</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s it, a replacement for Heroku.</p>
<p>In years of service, Dokku has never failed me. Sure, there were edge cases but
those were resolved quickly using the project’s Github issues.</p>
<h3 id="a-case-against-external-services">A case against external services</h3>
<p>Even though there are popular platform-as-a-service solutions like <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel
(Zeit)</a> and <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, I believe that developers should
self-host their apps more often than not.</p>
<ul>
<li>It would help you understand a lot more about Unix systems, server infrastructure, and network.</li>
<li>You would gain a product advantage, given you have an edge case that you most likely will, eventually.</li>
<li>An external service puts you in a place of total dependency. Historically, these services have had a lot of changes. Sometimes, breaking changes. You don’t want to be in that situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve used all of the services above. To state the obvious, it’s a good deal for
most developers even though the pricing is higher. Why? Because managing
servers ourselves is time-consuming and error-prone if that is not your main
activity. You don’t want to wake up in the middle of the night by the message
saying “your server is down”.</p>
<p>However, things are now much easier in the self-hosted world than they have
ever been before. Reproducible environments with containers and mature tooling
allow one to leave Heroku but not yet start messing with clusters.</p>
<p>That happened to me. Once Docker became a must in my toolbox, there was no
reason for me to continue relying on an external party. Headache was simply no
longer there.</p>
<h3 id="enter-caprover">Enter Caprover</h3>
<p>I have the following containerized, self-hosted and served through
<a href="https://cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> as well as checked with <a href="https://uptimerobot.com/">uptimerobot</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a> (web-analytics, an alternative to Google Analytics)</li>
<li><a href="https://ackee.electerious.com/">Ackee</a> (web-analytics, a simpler alternative to Google Analytics)</li>
<li><a href="https://sendy.co/">Sendy</a> (newsletters with AWS SES)</li>
<li><a href="https://min.io/">Minio</a> (AWS S3-compatible storage)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.monicahq.com/">Monica</a> (personal CRM)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://caprover.com/">Caprover</a> is how I deploy and manage all of it with good ol’ SSH
when needed. Deploying a new app is a matter of a few clicks. The support of
Docker Swarm is a cherry on top.</p>
<h3 id="business-case">Business case</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, chances are – external services will limit your ability to
add features to your product. It could be a fancy Nginx/Apache configuration,
custom domains for your users, or tweaking low-level performance.</p>
<p>Outages are bad, but it’s even worse when outages are out of your control. If
you have the knowledge to set it up and have all the tools to know when
something goes wrong, it’s an advantage on your side.</p>
<p>Business-wise, you know that the companies behind these services target the
biggest market. It means that if your product falls out of that
range, you’re left behind as you are an edge case to that service provider.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon some solid advice and enormous lists of ready-to-use solutions
on subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/">/r/selfhosted</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted">awesome-selfhosted</a>.</p>
<p>The big open-source community lets you be sure that possible problems with
setting up and configurations are more likely already solved and they can be
easily found.</p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>It’s important. As a technologist, I understand that the whole industry operates
on duct tape, and trusting corporations to respect your users’ privacy is not
at all realistic or rational.</p>
<p>A simple example in favor of self-hosted solutions: millions of people use ad
blockers. There is no need for you to use Google Analytics as it gets blocked,
worsens your reputation, and feeds big G’s network. Self-hosted alternatives
like <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a> or even something simple like <a href="https://ackee.electerious.com/">Ackee</a> might be enough.</p>
<p>Or you could replace Slack at your company with <a href="https://mattermost.com/">Mattermost</a> and be
sure that your internal communication is in safe hands – yours.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>As you can see there is a decent amount of upside for you to start
self-hosting. Of course, it doesn’t mean we have to give up nice-to-have
services but I gained a lot of value by doing so. No doubt it is an investment
but the gained knowledge and edge-case advantages proved to be a good return on
it.</p>
