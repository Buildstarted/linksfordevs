      <p>
        This is the sequel to <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">Writing An Interpreter In Go</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
       We're picking up right where we left off and write <mark>a&nbsp;compiler and a&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;machine</mark> for Monkey.
      </p>

      <p>
        Runnable and tested code front and center, built from the ground up, step by step â€” just like before.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this time, we're going to define bytecode, compile Monkey and execute it in our very own virtual machine.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's the next step in Monkey's evolution.

<p><em>Writing A Compiler In Go</em> is the <strong>sequel</strong> to <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">Writing An Interpreter In
Go</a>. It starts right where the first one stopped, with a fully-working,
fully-tested Monkey interpreter in hand, connecting both books seamlessly,
ready to build a compiler and a virtual machine for Monkey.</p>

<p>In this book, we use the codebase (included in the book!) from the first part
and extend it. We take the lexer, the parser, the AST, the REPL and the object
system and use them to build a new, faster implementation of Monkey, right next
to the tree-walking evaluator we built in the first book.</p>

<p>The approach is unchanged, too. Working, tested code is the focus, we build
everything from scratch, do baby steps, write tests firsts, use no
3rd-party-libraries and see and understand how all the pieces fit together.</p>

<p>It's a continuation in prose and in code.</p>

<p><strong>Do you need to read the first part before this one?</strong> If you're okay with
treating the code from the first book as a black box, then no. But that's not
what these books are about; they're about <em>opening up black boxes, looking
inside and shining a light</em>. You'll have the best understanding of where we're
going in this book, if you know where we started.</p>


      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="learn-how-to-write-a-compiler-and-a-virtual-machine">Learn how to write a compiler and a virtual machine</h3>

<p>Our main goal in in this book is to evolve Monkey. We change its
architecture and turn it into <strong>a bytecode compiler and virtual
machine</strong>.</p>

<p>We'll take the lexer, the parser, the AST and the object system we
wrote in the first book and use them to build our own Monkey compiler
and virtual machine â€¦ <strong>from scratch</strong>! We'll build them
side-by-side so that we'll always have a running system we can
steadily evolve.</p>



<p>What we end up with is not only much closer to the programming
languages we use every day, giving us a better understanding of how
they work, but also <strong>3x faster</strong>. And that's without explicitly
aiming for performance.</p>

<div>
  <p><img alt="Preview of Chapter 1" src="https://compilerbook.com/images/sample_thumbnail_2-97fc96b3.png">
    <img alt="Preview of Chapter 09" src="https://compilerbook.com/images/sample_thumbnail_3-98f2197a.png">
  </p>
</div>

<p>Here's what we'll do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We define our own <strong>bytecode instructions</strong>, specifying their
operands and their encoding. Along the way, we also build a
<strong>mini-disassembler</strong> for them.</li>
  <li>We write a <strong>compiler</strong> that takes in a Monkey AST and turns it into
bytecode by emitting instructions</li>
  <li>At the same time we build a <strong>stack-based virtual machine</strong> that executes the
bytecode in its main loop</li>
</ul>



<p>We'll learn a lot about computers, how they work, what machine code
and opcodes are, what <em>the stack</em> is and how to work with stack
pointers and frame pointers, what it means to define a <strong>calling
convention</strong>, and much more.</p>

<p>We also</p>

<ul>
  <li>build a <strong>symbol table</strong> and a <strong>constant pool</strong></li>
  <li>do <strong>stack arithmetic</strong></li>
  <li>generate <strong>jump instructions</strong></li>
  <li>build <strong>frames</strong> into our VM to execute <strong>functions with local bindings and arguments</strong>!</li>
  <li>add <strong>built-in functions</strong> to the VM</li>
  <li>get <strong>real closures</strong> working in the virtual machine and learn why closure-compilation is so tricky</li>
</ul>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="the-monkey-programming-language">The Monkey Programming Language</h3>

<p>The implementation of Monkey we build in <em>this book</em> is markedly
different from the tree-walking interpreter we built in <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">Writing An
Interpreter In Go</a>, but Monkey <strong>stays the same</strong>.</p>

<p>At the end, Monkey will still look and work like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Integers &amp; arithmetic expressions</span>
<span>let</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>50</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>8</span> <span>*</span> <span>3</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Strings</span>
<span>let</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"The Monkey programming language"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Booleans</span>
<span>let</span> <span>isMonkeyFastNow</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Arrays &amp; Hashes</span>
<span>let</span> <span>people</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Anna"</span><span>,</span> <span>"age"</span><span>:</span> <span>24</span><span>},</span> <span>{</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Bob"</span><span>,</span> <span>"age"</span><span>:</span> <span>99</span><span>}];</span>

<span>// Functions</span>
<span>let</span> <span>getName</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>person</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>person</span><span>[</span><span>"name"</span><span>];</span> <span>};</span>
<span>getName</span><span>(</span><span>people</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span> <span>// =&gt; "Anna"</span>
<span>getName</span><span>(</span><span>people</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]);</span> <span>// =&gt; "Bob"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And it will still support <strong>recursive functions</strong>, <strong>conditionals</strong>, <strong>implicit and explicit returning of values</strong>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>fibonacci</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>0</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The crown-jewel we'll build into our new Monkey implementation are <strong>closures</strong>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// `newAdder` returns a closure that makes use of the free variables `a` and `b`:</span>
<span>let</span> <span>newAdder</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span> <span>+</span> <span>c</span> <span>};</span>
<span>};</span>
<span>// This constructs a new `adder` function:</span>
<span>let</span> <span>adder</span> <span>=</span> <span>newAdder</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span>

<span>adder</span><span>(</span><span>8</span><span>);</span> <span>// =&gt; 11</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, we'll <strong>compile</strong> all of that to <strong>bytecode</strong> and execute it in a
<strong>stack-based virtual machine</strong>. That not only works, but is also tremendous
fun to build.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "This is a very polished pair of books that together give a steady path to
    follow for learning some of the real techniques that are used to implement
    programming languages. They're both well above average for their depth,
    technical clarity, and accessibility. I've been recommending them to
    everyone I work with who wants to get involved in compilers."

    "Longing for implementing a compiler, but lacking the guidance? Then
    this book is for you. Thorsten offers invaluable mentorship for tackling the multiple
    challenges that arise when writing a single-pass compiler and a virtual
    machine to execute the resulting code, in a pragmatic and test-driven
    approach. After going over this book, you'll certainly feel inspired to go
    further, such as extending the compiler with code transformations of
    your own."

    "The Monkey books are everything I've ever wanted in programming books, but could never find until now. They are a real labor of love and it shows on every page. The books are fun to read and showcase the Go programming language, but what makes them extraordinary is the fact that they're completely focused on giving the reader an accessible, conceptual understanding of the implementation of interpreters and compilers. It's hard to overstate just how rare yet extremely valuable that focus on understanding is in an educational book."

  "Thorsten's writing style is fun and easy to understand with detailed

    Rust</a>, translating the example Go code into Rust as I read through. Lexers,
  parsers, and interpreters are such a fundamental part of CS, these skills are
  valuable to more than just programmers implementing programming languages. As
  a project for picking up a new language, this book is perfect because it only
  requires the standard library and has extensive test driven development,
  which means you get quick feedback as you go along. I highly recommend it for
  programmers wanting to learn more about lexers, parsers, and interpreters or
  Go programmers picking up a new language looking for a project to learn
  through."

<p>Hello there! My name is Thorsten Ball. I'm a writer and programmer
living in Aschaffenburg, Germany. In my professional life as a
software developer, I build web applications and platforms. I have
deployed Ruby, JavaScript, Go and C code to production systems.</p>

<p>In my spare time, though, I like to do what I call <em>recreational
programming</em>, where I dig deep into various topics and their
codebases, taking them apart, recreating them in my own code, trying
to peel away layers of what seems like magic, hoping to come out the
other end with a better understanding of what it is that I do when I
program.</p>

<p>For the last few years, the two topics that kept my attention are
systems programming and programming languages: interpreters,
compilers, virtual machines, JIT compilers, assembly language â€“ I
can't get enough of it.</p>

<p>Writing an interpreter from scratch and writing <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">a book about
that</a> has been one of the most wonderful and satisfying things
I ever did as a programmer. It has been so much fun, in fact, that I
couldn't stop doing it, which is why you're looking at the next book.</p>

<p>You can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/thorstenball">@thorstenball on Twitter</a> to know what I'm up
to. If you want to know more about me, visit <a href="http://thorstenball.com/">my blog and
