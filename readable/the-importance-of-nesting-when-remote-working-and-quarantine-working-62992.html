It doesn't feel the same because it's not the same. It's a hard time right now and tension is high. </p> <p>"People are overwhelmed, afraid, and stressed. There's a background pressure - a psychic weight or stress - that is different in these times. This isn't a problem you can fix with a new webcam or a podcasting mic."</p> <p>I really believe that self-care is important and <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/RelationshipHacksMindfulnessDontLiveYourLifeByDefault.aspx">one should be as deliberate as one can in how they live</a>.</p> <p>One day we were working in the office and the next day we were home indefinitely. Some in spare bedrooms, most in our kitchens, laundry rooms, garages and front porches.</p> <h3>What does "nesting" mean?</h3> <p>Nesting is not just what a bird does to prepare their space for the coming family, it's also what we can do as humans to make a space for ourselves to be successful. It's the deliberate practice of setting up your work area so that you can be successful and fulfilled. </p> <p>Your space doesn't need to be fancy. Nesting isn't blinging your space or making it look expensive - nesting is making it YOURS. </p> <ul> <li>Can you <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/BrainBytesBackBunsTheProgrammersPriorities.aspx">sit and work comfortably</a>? Is your space ergonomic as it can be?</li> <ul> <li>Is your monitor or laptop angled in a way that doesn't cause eyestrain or neck strain?</li></ul> <li>Do the things around you feed your spirit? Toys? Gadgets? Family pics? Post-It Notes?</li> <ul> <li>Be intentional. Don't just let your space happen. What is calming for you? What's productive? Do you like a nice whiteboard? </li> <li>Perhaps a <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TotallyStressedOutSyncToPaper.aspx">fresh notebook can de-stress you</a>? Your office can be a Zen garden. Does clutter calm? Fill it with fun. Do you like open space? Clear your desk.</li></ul> <li>What's your lighting situation? </li> <ul> <li>Do you have natural light or a window nearby? Maybe you should.</li></ul></ul> <p>Stop for a second. Perhaps while reading this blog post. Look around and ask yourself - why is this space like this? How did it get this way and do I feel good here. What can you do? Maybe it's just straightening up. Perhaps literally just turning another direction to adjust light.</p> <p>This is the start of a process to make your space you own. You can't control your quarantine situation but you can be intentional about your nest.</p> <p>What have YOU done to make your space your own? How are you <strong>nesting</strong>?</p> <hr>  <p><strong>Sponsor: </strong>Have you tried <a href="https://hnsl.mn/3dJyfX4">developing in Rider</a> yet?
