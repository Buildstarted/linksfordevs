    <h1>The Conservative Party manifesto: An initial response from IFS Director Paul Johnson</h1>
    <article class="col-md-8 content-block"> <p>Below we outline an initial response from IFS Director Paul Johnson on the Conservative Party manifesto. We take policy areas by turn but this is not a full assessment. A fuller assessment from IFS researchers is due shortly.</p> <p><strong>Responding to the Conservative Party manifesto, IFS Director Paul Johnson said:</strong></p> <p>&quot;If the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos were notable for the scale of their ambitions the Conservative one is not. If a single Budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have been calling it modest. As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of significant policy action is remarkable.</p> <p>&quot;In part that is because the chancellor announced some big spending rises back In September. Other than for health and schools, though, that was a one-off increase. Taken at face value today&#x2019;s manifesto suggests that for most services, in terms of day-to-day spending, that&#x2019;s it. Health and school spending will continue to rise. Give or take pennies, other public services, and working age benefits, will see the cuts to their day-to-day budgets of the last decade baked in.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;One notable omission is any plan for social care. In his first speech as prime minister Boris Johnson promised to &apos;fix the crisis in social care once and for all&apos;. After two decades of dither by both parties in government it seems we are no further forward.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;On the tax side the rise in the National Insurance threshold was well trailed. The ambition for it to get to &#xA3;12,500 may remain, but only the initial rise to &#xA3;9,500 has been costed and firmly promised. Most in paid work would benefit, but by less than &#xA3;2 a week. Another &#xA3;6 billion would need to be found to get to &#xA3;12,500 by the end of the parliament. Given the pressures on the spending side that is not surprising.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Perhaps the biggest, and least welcome, announcement is the &apos;triple tax lock&apos;: no increases in rates of income tax, NICs or VAT. That&#x2019;s a constraint the chancellor may come to regret. It is also part of a fundamentally damaging narrative &#x2013; that we can have the public services we want, with more money for health and pensions and schools &#x2013; without paying for them. We can&#x2019;t.&quot;</p> </article>
