(I, too, remember the increasingly frantic and fearful warnings of a "cyber Peal Harbor," "cyber Katrina" -- when that was a thing -- or "cyber 9/11."  I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2010/07/threat_of_cyberwar_h.html">made</a><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/stoking_cyber_f.html">fun</a> of those warnings back then.) The author's answer:</p><blockquote><p>Three main barriers are likely preventing this. For one, cyberattacks can lack the kind of drama and immediate physical carnage that terrorists seek. Identifying the specific perpetrator of a cyberattack can also be difficult, meaning terrorists might have trouble reaping the propaganda benefits of clear attribution. Finally, and most simply, it's possible that they just can't pull it off.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/11/why-no-cyber-911-for-15-years.html">Commenting</a> on the article, Rob Graham adds:</p><blockquote><p>I think there are lots of warning from so-called "experts" who aren't qualified to make such warnings, that the press errs on the side of giving such warnings credibility instead of challenging them.

</p><p>I think mostly the reason why cyberterrorism doesn't happen is that which motivates violent people is different than what which motivates technical people, pulling apart the groups who would want to commit cyberterrorism from those who can.</p></blockquote><p>These are all good reasons, but I think both authors missed the most important one: there simply aren't a lot of terrorists out there. Let's ask the question more generally: why hasn't there been another 9/11 since 2001? I also remember dire predictions that large-scale terrorism was the new normal, and that we would see 9/11-scale attacks regularly. But since then, nothing. We could credit the fantastic counterterrorism work of the US and other countries, but a more reasonable explanation is that there are very few terrorists and even fewer organized ones. Our fear of terrorism is <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2006-09-01/there-still-terrorist-threat-myth-omnipresent-enemy">far greater</a> than the actual risk.</p><p>This isn't to say that cyberterrorism can never happen. Of course it will, sooner or later. But I don't foresee it becoming a preferred terrorism method anytime soon. Graham again:</p><blockquote><p>In the end, if your goal is to cause major power blackouts, your best bet is to bomb power lines and distribution centers, rather than hack them.</p></blockquote><p class="entry-tags">Tags: <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=bombs&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">bombs</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=cyberattack&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">cyberattack</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=cyberterrorism&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">cyberterrorism</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=fear&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">fear</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=risk%20assessment&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">risk assessment</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=terrorism&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">terrorism</a></p><p class="posted"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/11/what_happened_t.html">Posted on November 19, 2018 at  6:50 AM</a>
