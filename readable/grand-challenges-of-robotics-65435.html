<p><em><u>Last Update</u>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">2020-08-09</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I started asking, “What are the important problems of your field?” And after a week or so, “What important problems are you working on?” And after some more time, I came in one day and said, “If what you are doing is not important, and if you don’t think it is going to lead to something important, why are you (at Bell Labs) working on it?” I wasn’t welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else to eat with! — Richard Hamming, You and your research</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What grand challenges do we need to solve to push robotics (and AI) forward? When I thought hard about this question, I realized that I didn’t have a good answer. I’m actually not sure why I never asked myself this question before. Perhaps I’d converged to the “stationary distribution” of traversing only “relevant” research questions. Or maybe it’s a function of the sheer diversity in the different fields of inquiry that robotics supports. This coupled with the fast pace of the field makes it hard to identify key challenges and track progress. Nonetheless, I believe this is an important question to reflect on, not just for personal gratification, but more importantly, to understand how research contributions in one field can ripple across the space of research and affect questions in another field.</p>

<p>I expect this to be a living (and evolving) document as I distill information to reach a clearer understanding. For now, I’m bootstrapping most of the content from [1] and also using the paper as a scaffolding for organization. However, I expect the structure and content of this post to evolve as I read, synthesize, and figure out potentially better ways to organize the information.</p>

<p>While providing links to references + further reading, I’ve made the conscious decision of linking to sources with a high “fan-out”, to enable an easy launching point to read about further research.</p>

<p>I’d <a href="https://twitter.com/bhaprayan">appreciate suggestions</a> on content to add, general feedback, and comments!</p>

<p><em>Goal:</em> the seamless control of peripheral neuroprostheses, functional electric stimulation devices, and exoskeletons.</p>

<p><em>Challenges:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>sensing and data acquisition because current modalities are expensive and cumbersome</li>
<li>data processing and dealing with artifacts of non-cerebral origin (especially for wearable approaches)</li>
<li>cortex folding differs between individuals, as do relevant functional maps</li>

<li><p>develop stochastic models for predicting collective behavior in large scale swarms (since interactions between individuals grow combinatorially)</p>

<ul>
<li>we lack models of flock/herd-like groups that elude enumeration in small scale groups yet do not justify ensemble-averaged models seen in large scale swarms</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>no systematic approach to designing multidimensional perception-action-communication feedback loops across large groups</p></li>

<li><p>lack of tools to create teams that can be responsive to human commands can adapt to changing conditions are robust to disturbances, resilient to adversarial, disruptive changes caused by large scale failures, or damage to swarm infrastructure.</p></li>

<p><em>Goal:</em> to understand human social dynamics and moral norms and that can be truly integrated with our social life showing empathy and natural social behaviors.</p>

<p><em>Challenges:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>we have very few comprehensive, quantitative analyses of human social responses</p></li>

<li><p>modeling social dynamics</p></li>

<li><p>learning social + moral norms</p></li>

<li><p>building a robotic theory of mind</p></li>

<li><p>significant perceptual demands:</p>

<ul>
<li>social cues, such as gaze direction, facial expressions, or vocal intonation, are often extremely detailed, rapid, nuanced signals that are embedded within other activity</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>we still lack systems that can operate under the diverse natural conditions and real-world time constraints that social interactions demand</p></li>

<li><p>social signals are context and culture-dependent</p></li>

<li><p>tools required to model the expectation of people around the robot and expanding the robot’s understanding of the consequences of its own actions</p></li>

<li><p>build and maintain complex models of people (knowledge, beliefs, goals, desires, and emotions)</p></li>

<li><p>need models that allow robots to have rich, usable models of human mental states</p></li>

<li><p>most current robots have been designed for short term interaction, but human interactions span months, years, and even decades</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>The future:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>elements from multiple input modalities combined to form predictive models of social intentions</li>
<li>integration of models of episodic memory, hierarchical models of tasks and goals, robust models of emotion to create detailed cognitive models</li>

<h2 id="a-name-ethics-j-ethics-and-security-a"><a name="ethics">[j] Ethics and security</a></h2>

<p><em>Goal:</em> to foster responsible innovation in robotics.</p>

<p><em>Challenges:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>excessive reliance on robotics + AI may lead to the delegation of sensitive tasks to autonomous systems that should remain partly subject to human supervision</li>
<li>robotics + AI may remove responsibility from people whenever an autonomous system could be blamed for a failure</li>
<li>unemployment is an ethical problem since robotics + AI could change the workforce structure, cause a shift in the skills base, and potentially facilitate a complete de-skilling of the workforce</li>
<li>AI may erode human freedom, due to unplanned and unwelcome changes in human behaviors to accommodate the routines that make automation work and people’s lives easier.</li>
<li>robotics + AI can refine strategies and launch more aggressive counteroperations (security), which may snowball into an intensification of attacks and responses, which could threaten the key infrastructure of our society.</li>
