Microsoft <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/">recently moved its Docker images to Microsoft Container Regitsry (MCR)</a> instead of hosting them on Docker Hub. This post uses the new image names, and includes <a href="#updating-to-the-new-microsoft-container-registry-net-core-docker-images">a translation from the old image names to the new image names</a>.</p></blockquote><p>When you build and deploy an application in Docker, you define how your image should be built using a Dockerfile. This file lists the steps required to create the image, for example: set an environment variable, copy a file, or run a script. Whenever a step is run, a new <em>layer</em> is created. Your final Docker image consists of all the changes introduced by these layers in your Dockerfile.</p><p>Typically, you don't start from an empty image where you need to install an operating system, but from a "base" image that contains an already-configured OS. For .NET Core development, Microsoft provide a number of different images depending on what it is you're trying to achieve. </p><p>In this post, I look at the various Docker base images available for .NET Core development, how they differ, and when you should use each of them. I'm only going to look at the Linux amd64 images, but there are Windows container versions and even Linux arm32 images available too. At the time of writing the latest (non-preview) images available are <code>2.2.3</code> and <code>2.2.105</code> for the various runtime and SDK images respectively.</p><blockquote><p>Note: You should normally be specific about which version of a Docker image you build on in your Dockerfiles (i.e. don't use <code>latest</code>). For that reason, all the images I mention in this post use the current latest version numbers, <code>2.2.105</code> and <code>2.2.3</code>. Microsoft recommends dropping the patch number so you get automatic rolling-forward of builds, without having to remember to update all of your Dockerfiles. The downside to that is you can't easily replicate a previous build, so the choice is yours.</p></blockquote><p>I'll start by briefly discussing the difference between the .NET Core SDK and the .NET Core Runtime, as it's an important factor when deciding which base image you need. I'll then walk through each of the images in turn, using the Dockerfiles for each to explain what they contain, and hence what you should use them for. </p><blockquote><p><strong>tl;dr;</strong> This is a pretty long post, so for convenience, here's some links to the relevant sections and a one-liner use case:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Note that all of these images are hosted in the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR), but images that were previously available in Docker Hub will continue to do so. I strongly suggest <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-container-images-now-published-to-microsoft-container-registry/">reading the announcement blog post describing the move</a>. </p><h2 id="updating-to-the-new-microsoft-container-registry-net-core-docker-images" class="heading-with-anchor">Updating to the new Microsoft Container Registry .NET Core Docker images<a href="#updating-to-the-new-microsoft-container-registry-net-core-docker-images"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>If you've been working with .NET Core and Docker for a while, these changes might be a little disorienting. Luckily, if you're working with .NET Core 2.1 or above there's a clear path to switching to the new image names:</p><ul><li><strong>If you were previously using</strong><code>microsoft/dotnet:2.1.0-runtime-deps</code>: <ul><li>Use <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-deps:2.1.0</code></li></ul></li><li><strong>If you were previously using</strong><code>microsoft/dotnet:2.1.0-runtime</code>: <ul><li>Use <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:2.1.0</code></li></ul></li><li><strong>If you were previously using</strong><code>microsoft/dotnet:2.1.0-aspnetcore-runtime</code>: <ul><li>Use <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.1.0</code></li></ul></li><li><strong>If you were previously using</strong><code>microsoft/dotnet:2.1.300-sdk</code>: <ul><li>Use <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.1.300</code></li></ul></li></ul><p>Note that not <em>all</em> of the image tags available on Docker Hub are available on MCR. For example, .NET Core 1.0 and 2.0 images (which are now out of support) will not be available in the new MCR repository. They'll continue to be available on Docker Hub.</p><p>You can still find a description of all the available images on Docker Hub by viewing the "old" repository at <code>microsoft/dotnet</code>, which redirects to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core">https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core</a>. If you're coming from pre-.NET Core 2.1 images, be aware that the <code>microsoft/aspnetcore</code> and <code>microsoft/aspnetcore-build</code> repositories have both been deprecated. There is no true 2.1+ equivalent to the old <a href="/exploring-the-net-core-docker-files-dotnet-vs-aspnetcore-vs-aspnetcore-build/#5-microsoft-aspnetcore-build-2-0-3"><code>microsoft/aspnetcore-build:2.0.3</code></a> image which included Node, Bower, and Gulp, or the <a href="/exploring-the-net-core-docker-files-dotnet-vs-aspnetcore-vs-aspnetcore-build/#6-microsoft-aspnetcore-build-1-0-2-0"><code>microsoft/aspnetcore-build:1.0-2.0</code></a> image which included multiple .NET Core SDKs. Instead, it's recommended you <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/">use MultiStage builds</a> to achieve this instead.</p><h2 id="the-net-core-runtime-vs-the-net-core-sdk" class="heading-with-anchor">The .NET Core Runtime vs the .NET Core SDK<a href="#the-net-core-runtime-vs-the-net-core-sdk"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>One of the most often lamented aspects of .NET Core and .NET Core development is around version numbers. There are so many different moving parts, and none of the version numbers match up, so it can be difficult to figure out what you need. </p><p>For example, on my dev machine I am building .NET Core 2.2 apps, so I installed the .NET Core 2.2 SDK to allow me to do so. When I look at what I have installed using <code>dotnet --info</code>, I get (a more verbose version) of the following:</p><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> dotnet --info

I haven't shown all 39 I apparently have installed… I really need to claim some space back!</p></blockquote><p>Whether you need the .NET Core SDK or the .NET Core runtime depends on what you're trying to do: </p><ul><li>The .NET Core SDK - This is what you need to <em>build</em> .NET Core applications. </li><li>The .NET Core Runtime - This is what you need to <em>run</em> .NET Core applications.</li></ul><p>When you install the SDK, you get the runtime as well, so on your dev machines you can just install the SDK. However, when it comes to deployment you need to give it a little more thought. The SDK contains everything you need to build a .NET Core app, so it's much larger than the runtime alone (122MB vs 22MB for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows">the MSI files</a>). If you're just going to be <em>running</em> the app on a machine (or in a Docker container) then you don't need the full SDK, the runtime will suffice, and will keep the image as small as possible.</p><p>For the rest of this post, I'll walk through the main Docker images available for .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. I assume you have a working knowledge of Docker - if you're new to Docker I suggest checking out Steve Gordon's excellent series on <a href="https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/docker-dotnet-developers-part-1">Docker for .NET developers</a>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>Contains native dependencies</li><li>No .NET Core runtime or .NET Core SDK installed </li><li>Use for running Self-Contained Deployment apps</li></ul></blockquote><p>The first image we'll look at forms the basis for most of the other .NET Core images. It actually doesn't even have .NET Core installed. Instead, it consists of the base <code>debian:stretch-slim</code> image and has all the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md">low-level native dependencies</a> on which .NET Core depends. </p><blockquote><p>The .NET Core 2.2 Docker images are currently all available in four flavours, depending on the OS image they're based on: <code>debian:stretch-slim</code>, <code>ubuntu:bionic</code>, <code>alpine:3.8</code>, and <code>alpine:3.9</code>. There are also ARM32 versions of the <code>debian</code> and <code>ubuntu</code> images. In this post I'm just going to look at the <code>debian</code> images, as they are the default. </p></blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/7e4359dfe6e1bc649fbb58de273da3d35bf864f1/2.1/runtime-deps/stretch-slim/amd64/Dockerfile">The Dockerfile</a> consists of a single <code>RUN</code> command that <code>apt-get install</code>s the required dependencies on top of the base image, and sets a few environment variables for convenience.</p><pre class="language-docker"><code class="language-docker"><span class="token keyword">FROM</span> debian<span class="token punctuation">:</span>stretch<span class="token punctuation">-</span>slim

Similarly, if you're running an ASP.NET Core app, then you should use the <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2.3</code> image instead (up next), as it contains <a href="/exploring-the-microsoft-aspnetcore-app-shared-framework-in-asp-net-core-2-1-preview-1/">the shared runtime</a> required for most ASP.NET Core apps.</p><blockquote><ul><li>Contains .NET Core runtime and the ASP.NET Core shared framework</li><li>Use for running ASP.NET Core apps</li><li>Sets the default URL for apps to <code>http://+:80</code></li></ul></blockquote><p>.NET Core 2.1+ moves away from <a href="/the-microsoft-aspnetcore-all-metapackage-is-huge-and-thats-awesome-thanks-to-the-net-core-runtime-store-2/">the <em>runtime store</em> feature</a> introduced in .NET Core 2.0, and replaces it with a series of <em>shared frameworks</em>. This is a similar concept, but with some subtle benefits (to cloud providers in particular, e.g. Microsoft). I wrote a post about the shared framework and <a href="/exploring-the-microsoft-aspnetcore-app-shared-framework-in-asp-net-core-2-1-preview-1/">the associated <em>Microsoft.AspNetCore.App</em> metapackage here</a>.</p><p>By installing the <em>Microsoft.AspNetCore.App</em> shared framework, all the packages that make up <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App">the metapackage</a> are already available, so when your app is published, it can exclude those dlls from the output. This makes your published output smaller, and improves layer caching for Docker images.</p><p>The <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/apnet:2.2.3</code> image is very similar to the <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:2.2.3</code> image, but instead of just installing the .NET Core runtime and shared framework, it installs the .NET Core runtime and the ASP.NET Core shared framework, so you can run ASP.NET Core apps, as well as .NET Core console apps. </p><p>You can view the Dockerfile for the image <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/7e4359dfe6e1bc649fbb58de273da3d35bf864f1/2.2/aspnet/stretch-slim/amd64/Dockerfile">here</a>:</p><pre class="language-docker"><code class="language-docker"><span class="token keyword">ARG</span> REPO=mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime<span class="token punctuation">-</span>deps

This is the image to use if you've published an ASP.NET Core app and you need to run it in production. It has the smallest possible footprint but all the necessary framework components and optimisations. You can't use it for building your app though, as it doesn't have the SDK installed.

Unlike all the runtime images which use <code>debian:stretch-slim</code> as the base, the <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2.105</code> image uses the <code>buildpack-deps:stretch-scm</code> image. According to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps/">Docker Hub description</a>, the <code>buildpack</code> image:</p><blockquote><p>…includes a large number of "development header" packages needed by various things like Ruby Gems, PyPI modules, etc.…a majority of arbitrary gem install / npm install / pip install should be successful without additional header/development packages…</p></blockquote><p>The <code>stretch-scm</code> tag also ensures common tools like <code>curl</code>, <code>git</code>, and <code>ca-certificates</code> are installed. </p><p>The <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2.105</code> image installs the native prerequisites (as you saw in the <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-deps:2.2.3</code> image), and then installs the .NET Core SDK. Finally, it sets some environment variables and warms up the NuGet package cache by running <code>dotnet help</code> in an empty folder, which makes subsequent <code>dotnet</code> operations faster.</p><p>You can view the Dockerfile for the image <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/7e4359dfe6e1bc649fbb58de273da3d35bf864f1/2.2/sdk/stretch/amd64/Dockerfile">here</a>:</p><pre class="language-docker"><code class="language-docker"><span class="token keyword">FROM</span> buildpack<span class="token punctuation">-</span>deps<span class="token punctuation">:</span>stretch<span class="token punctuation">-</span>scm

Technically you can also use this image for running your apps in production as the SDK includes the runtime, but you shouldn't do that in practice. As discussed at the beginning of this post, optimising your Docker images in production is important for performance reasons, but the <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2.105</code> image weighs in at a hefty 1.73GB, compared to the 255MB for the <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:2.2.3</code> image.</p><p>To get the best of both worlds, you should use the SDK image to build your app, and one of the runtime images to run your app in production. You can see how to do this using Docker multi-stage builds in Scott Hanselman's post <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/OptimizingASPNETCoreDockerImageSizes.aspx">here</a>, or in <a href="/pushing-nuget-packages-built-in-docker-by-running-the-container/">my blog series here</a>.</p><h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor">Summary<a href="#summary"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>In this post I walked through some of the common Docker images used in .NET Core 2.2 development. Each of the images have a set of specific use-cases, and it's important you use the right one for your requirements. These images have changed since I wrote the previous version of this post; if you're using an earlier version (&lt; 2.1) of .NET Core <a href="/exploring-the-net-core-docker-files-dotnet-vs-aspnetcore-vs-aspnetcore-build/">check out that one instead</a>. </p></blockquote></div></div></div></div>
