    <h1>The New Arduino&#xA0;Portenta</h1>
    <div class="article_layout__content__3qDV0 project-story hljs-monokai"><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL"><span>Announced today at </span><a href="https://ces.tech/" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">CES</a><span> is the Arduino </span><a href="http://arduino.cc/pro" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">Portenta H7 </a><span>module. Despite visual similarities to their other MKR form factor boards, and putting aside the lack of classic Arduino blue color, this new board isn&#x2019;t really like other Arduinos. Designed for industry, not makers, the new Portenta is rather different.</span></p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL">The first Arduino boards were arrived back in what seems almost like pre-history now, all the way back in 2005, but it wasn&#x2019;t until the introduction of the Arduino Uno, which didn&#x2019;t come along until 2010, that the boards really become one of the pillars of the maker movement.</p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL"><span>However, a lot has changed over the course of the last decade. Distracted as they were by their </span><a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/07/28/arduino-vs-arduino-musto-out-banzi-in/" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">legal troubles,</a><span> many would argue that Arduino lost track of the things that made them successful.</span></p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL"><span>The plummeting price of hardware, which led to the </span><a href="https://medium.com/@aallan/capable-computing-50867847a8d8" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">capable computing </a><span>movement, computing that is &#x201C;</span><em>good enough,</em><span>&#x201D; as well as the arrival of boards running MicroPython and JavaScript, </span><a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/06/26/the-next-generation-of-high-powered-microcontrollers/" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">changed the hardware landscape </a><span>rather profoundly, and Arduino didn&#x2019;t seem to adapt. Or at least, not quickly enough.</span></p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL"><span>But over the last year (or two) things have started changing a lot more quickly. While the classic Arduino form factor may be </span><a href="https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/11/05/welcoming-new-humble-masterpieces-into-momas-collection/" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">iconic,</a><span> it </span><a href="https://blog.hackster.io/introducing-two-new-boards-from-arduino-f4654b7bd0ec" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">is also dying.</a><span> The &#x2018;legacy&#x2019; Uno form factor is </span><a href="https://blog.hackster.io/introducing-the-arduino-uno-wifi-7118f428ad39" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">still around,</a><span> and it&#x2019;s likely to stick around for more than a few more years yet, but increasingly newer boards from Arduino use the more modern </span><a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino/arduino-mkr-family" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">MKR form factor,</a><span> while the </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/introducing-four-new-arduino-nanos-869b8abbccb4" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">return of the Arduino Nano </a><span>has allowed the company to remain competative at the cheaper end of the market.</span></p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL">Other changes have been a bit more subtle than new hardware, but in a way, far more significant, and may be indicating a change of direction for the entire company.</p><div><div class="image_carousel__container__hMJxn undefined"><div class="image_carousel__caption__2sZrD"><span>The Arduino Portenta H7 module. (&#x1F4F7;: Arduino)</span></div></div></div><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL"><span>It&#x2019;s arguable that the original Arduino Developoment Environment was one of the things that, a decade ago, drove the success of the Arduino. However these days, it is showing its age. So perhaps the biggest amongst the indicators was the </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/arduino-pro-development-environment-announced-at-maker-faire-rome-06da6ab01e32" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">arrival of the Arduino Pro Development Environment,</a><span> announced at the tail end of last year at Maker Faire Rome. A step down a path by Arduino towards support for small manufacturers rather than its core maker audience.</span></p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL"><span>The Arduino team has also made &#x201C;&#x2026;</span><em>a range of Arduino reference design assets, from validated component symbols and footprints to schematic and layout templates&#x201D;</em><span> available in Altium Designer to shorten times between prototyping and production.</span></p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL"><span>The new Portenta module announced today is the first product in what it to become a new family of boards. It is built around an STMicroelectronics </span><a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32h747-757.html" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">STM32H747,</a><span> with a dual-core Arm Cortex-M7 and a Cortex-M4 on chip, running at 480MHz and 240MHz, respectively. Designed and rated for industrial applications, it can operate in temperatures between -40 and 85&#xB0;C.</span></p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL"><span>Though the Portenta H7 module is capable of running Arduino code natively, there is also support to run Arduino code </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/new-arduino-nano-boards-run-arm-s-mbed-os-3777ccb89017" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">on top of the Arm Mbed OS </a><span>open source IoT operating system, to provide &#x201C;</span><em>enterprise grade</em><span>&#x201D; features while still retaining the familiar Arduino development environment.</span></p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL">Yet, in what is a a big departure for Arduino, the Portenta H7 module can also run Python and JavaScript code out of the box, making it much more accessible to a broader range of developers that have grown up with those languages rather than C.</p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL"><span>The new Portenta H7 will be made generally available next month, although it is available in limited quantities now </span><a href="http://arduino.cc/pro" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">for beta customers &#x2014;</a><span> initially it is being targeted towards enterprise and SMB customers &#x2014; and if you happen to be at CES this week </span><a href="https://ces20.mapyourshow.com/8_0/exhibitor/exhibitor-details.cfm?ExhID=T0012609" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue">the Arduino team is in town </a><span>showing off the hardware here in Las Vegas.</span></p></div>
