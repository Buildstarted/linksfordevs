<p>As quarantined millions gather virtually on conferencing platforms, the best of those,&nbsp;<a href="http://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/style/zoom-parties-coronavirus-memes.html">doing</a> <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/23/ok-zoomer-zoom-worlds-new-favourite-social-network-12443418/">very well</a>. Hats off.</p>
<p>But Zoom is also—correctly—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_Video_Communications#Privacy">taking</a> a <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=zoom+privacy+risk">lot of heat</a> for its <a href="https://zoom.us/privacy">privacy policy</a>, which is creepily chummy with the tracking-based advertising biz (also called <em>adtech</em>). Two days ago, <em>Consumer Reports</em>, the greatest moral conscience in the history of business, published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/video-conferencing-services/zoom-teleconferencing-privacy-concerns/">Zoom Calls Aren’t as Private as You May Think. Here’s What You Should Know: Videos and notes can be used by companies and hosts. Here are some tips to protect yourself</a>. And there was already lots of bad PR. A few samples:</p>

</ul>
<p>There’s too much to cover here, so I’ll narrow my inquiry down to the “Does Zoom sell Personal Data?” section of the privacy policy, which was last updated on March 18. The section runs two paragraphs, and I’ll comment on the second one, starting here:</p>
<blockquote><p>… Zoom does use certain standard advertising tools which require Personal Data…</p></blockquote>
<p>What they mean by that is adtech. What they’re also saying here is that Zoom is in the advertising business, and in the worst end of it: the one that lives off harvested personal data. What makes this extra creepy is that Zoom is in a position to gather plenty of personal data, some of it very intimate (for example with a shrink talking to a patient) without anyone in the conversation knowing about it. (Unless, of course, they see an ad somewhere that looks like it was informed by a private conversation on Zoom.)</p>
<p>A person whose personal data is being shed on Zoom doesn’t know that’s happening because Zoom doesn’t tell them. There’s no red light, like the one you see when a session is being recorded. If you were in a browser instead of an app, an extension such as Privacy Badger could tell you there are trackers sniffing your ass. And, if your browser is one that cares about privacy, such as Brave, Firefox or Safari, there’s a good chance it would be blocking trackers as well. But in the Zoom app, you can’t tell if or how your personal data is being harvested.</p>
<blockquote><p>(think, for example, Google Ads and Google Analytics).</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s no need to think about those, because both are widely known for compromising personal privacy. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google">here</a>. And <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/google-analytics-privacy/">here</a>. Also Brett Frischmann and Evan Selinger’s <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/03/27/zoom/"><em>Re-Engineering Humanity</em></a> and Shoshana Zuboff’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697">In the Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a></em>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>We use these tools to help us improve your advertising experience (such as serving advertisements on our behalf across the Internet, serving personalized ads on our website, and providing analytics services).</p></blockquote>
<p>Nobody goes to Zoom for an “advertising experience,” personalized or not. And nobody wants ads aimed at their eyeballs elsewhere on the Net by third parties using personal information leaked out through Zoom.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sharing Personal Data with the third-party provider while using these tools may fall within the extremely broad definition of the “sale” of Personal Data under certain state laws&nbsp;<span>because those companies might use Personal Data for their own business purposes, as well as Zoom’s purposes.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>By “certain state laws” I assume they mean California’s new&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a>, but they also mean the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>. (Elsewhere in the privacy policy is a “Following the instructions of our users” section, addressing the CCPA, that’s as wordy and aversive as instructions for a zero-gravity toilet. Also, have you ever seen, anywhere near the user interface for the Zoom app, a place for you to instruct the company regarding your privacy? Didn’t think so.)</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, Google may use this data to improve its advertising services for all companies who use their services.</p></blockquote>
<p>May? Please. The right word is <em>will</em>. Why wouldn’t they?</p>
<blockquote><p>(It is important to note advertising programs have historically operated in this manner. It is only with the recent developments in data privacy laws that such activities fall within the definition of a “sale”).</p></blockquote>
<p>While advertising has been around since forever, tracking people’s eyeballs on the Net so they can be advertised at all over the place has only been in fashion since around 2007, which was when&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a> was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/technology/31cnd-privacy.html">first floated</a> as a way to fight it. Adtech (tracking-based advertising) began to hockey-stick in 2010 (when <em>The Wall Street Journa</em>l launched its excellent and still-missed&nbsp;<em><a href="https://juliaangwin.com/category/portfolio/wall-street-journal/what-they-know/page/3/">What They Know</a></em>&nbsp;series, which I <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2010/07/31/the-data-bubble/">celebrated</a>&nbsp;at the time). As for history, ad blocking became the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">biggest boycott, ever</a>&nbsp;by 2015. And, thanks to adtech, the GDPR went into force in 2018 and the CCPA 2020,. We never would have had either without “advertising programs” that “historically operated in this manner.”</p>
<p>By the way, “this manner” is only&nbsp;<em>called</em> advertising. In fact it’s actually a form of direct marketing, which began as junk mail. I explain the difference in&nbsp;<a href="http://j.mp/adwhtch">Separating Advertising’s Wheat and Chaff</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you opt out of “sale” of your info, your Personal Data that may have been used for these activities will no longer be shared with third parties.</p></blockquote>
<p>Opt out? Where? How? I just spent a long time logged in to Zoom &nbsp;<a href="https://us04web.zoom.us/" title="https://us04web.zoom.us/" target="_blank">https://us04web.zoom.us/</a>), and can’t find anything about opting out of “‘sale’ of your personal info.”</p>
<p>Here’s the thing:&nbsp;<em>Zoom doesn’t need to be in the advertising business</em>, least of all in the part of it that lives like a vampire off the blood of human data. If Zoom needs more money, it should charge more for its services, or give less away for free. Zoom has an extremely valuable service, which it performs very well—better than anybody else, apparently. It also has a platform with lots of apps with just as absolute an interest in privacy. They should be concerned as well. (Unless, of course, they also want to be in the privacy-violating end of the advertising business.)</p>
<p>Finally, Zoom really has no serious value if it doesn’t protect personal privacy. That’s why they need to fix this.</p>
<p>What its current privacy policy says is worse than “You don’t have any privacy here.” It says, “We expose your virtual necks to data vampires who can do what they will with it.”</p>
<p>Please fix it, Zoom.</p>
<p>As for Zoom’s competitors, there’s a great weakness to exploit here.</p>
