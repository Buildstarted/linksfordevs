	<p>iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple&nbsp;Watch, and Apple&nbsp;TV. They’re some of the most powerful tools ever made for learning, exploring, and staying in touch. Parents love them. Kids love them. And we’re continually designing new features to help make sure kids use them in the ways you&nbsp;want.</p>

		<p>The new Find&nbsp;My&nbsp;app combines Find&nbsp;My&nbsp;iPhone and Find&nbsp;My&nbsp;Friends into a single, easy-to-use app on Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Find&nbsp;My can help you locate a missing family member’s iPhone, Mac, iPad, or Apple&nbsp;Watch — even if it’s offline and sleeping.</p>

							<h3><span role="text">It’s all anonymous.</span></h3>
							        <p>The process is anonymous and encrypted end-to-end so no one, including Apple, knows the identity of any reporting device. And because the reporting happens silently using tiny bits of data that piggyback on existing network traffic, there’s no need to worry about your battery life, your data usage, or your&nbsp;privacy.</p>
