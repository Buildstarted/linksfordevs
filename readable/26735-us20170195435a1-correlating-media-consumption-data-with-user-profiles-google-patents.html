The social-networking system may, with input from a user, create and store in the social-networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information, communication-channel information, and information on personal interests of the user. The social-networking system may also, with input from a user, create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social-networking system, as well as provide services (e.g., wall posts, photo-sharing, event organization, messaging, games, or advertisements) to facilitate social interaction between or among users.</p></li><li><para-num num="[0003]"></para-num><p id="p-0004" num="0003" class="description-line">The social-networking system may send over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social-networking system.

As an example and not by way of limitation, a concept may correspond to a place (such as, for example, a movie theater, restaurant, landmark, or city); a website (such as, for example, a website associated with social-network system <b>160</b> or a third-party website associated with a web-application server); an entity (such as, for example, a person, business, group, sports team, or celebrity); a resource (such as, for example, an audio file, video file, digital photo, text file, structured document, or application) which may be located within social-networking system <b>160</b> or on an external server, such as a web-application server; real or intellectual property (such as, for example, a sculpture, painting, movie, game, song, idea, photograph, or written work); a game; an activity; an idea or theory; an object in a augmented/virtual reality environment; another suitable concept; or two or more such concepts. A concept node <b>204</b> may be associated with information of a concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems, including social-networking system <b>160</b>.

The third-party webpage or resource may include, among other elements, content, a selectable or other icon, or other inter-actable object (which may be implemented, for example, in JavaScript, AJAX, or PHP codes) representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation, a third-party webpage may include a selectable icon such as “like,” “check-in,” “eat,” “recommend,” or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third-party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons (e.g., “check-in”), causing a client system <b>130</b> to send to social-networking system <b>160</b> a message indicating the user's action. In response to the message, social-networking system <b>160</b> may create an edge (e.g., a check-in-type edge) between a user node <b>202</b> corresponding to the user and a concept node <b>204</b> corresponding to the third-party webpage or resource and store edge <b>206</b> in one or more data stores.</p></li><li><para-num num="[0025]"></para-num><p id="p-0026" num="0025" class="description-line">In particular embodiments, a pair of nodes in social graph <b>200</b> may be connected to each other by one or more edges <b>206</b>. An edge <b>206</b> connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments, an edge <b>206</b> may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation, a first user may indicate that a second user is a “friend” of the first user. In response to this indication, social-networking system <b>160</b> may send a “friend request” to the second user. If the second user confirms the “friend request,” social-networking system <b>160</b> may create an edge <b>206</b> connecting the first user's user node <b>202</b> to the second user's user node <b>202</b> in social graph <b>200</b> and store edge <b>206</b> as social-graph information in one or more of data stores <b>164</b>.

As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge <b>206</b> may represent a friendship, family relationship, business or employment relationship, fan relationship (including, e.g., liking, etc.), follower relationship, visitor relationship (including, e.g., accessing, viewing, checking-in, sharing, etc.), subscriber relationship, superior/subordinate relationship, reciprocal relationship, non-reciprocal relationship, another suitable type of relationship, or two or more such relationships. Moreover, although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected, this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected.

As an example and not by way of limitation, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a user may “like,” “attended,” “played,” “listened,” “cooked,” “worked at,” or “watched” a concept, each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept-profile page corresponding to a concept node <b>204</b> may include, for example, a selectable “check in” icon (such as, for example, a clickable “check in” icon) or a selectable “add to favorites” icon. Similarly, after a user clicks these icons, social-networking system <b>160</b> may create a “favorite” edge or a “check in” edge in response to a user's action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation, a user (user “C”) may listen to a particular song (“Imagine”) using a particular application (SPOTIFY, which is an online music application). In this case, social-networking system <b>160</b> may create a “listened” edge <b>206</b> and a “used” edge (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) between user nodes <b>202</b> corresponding to the user and concept nodes <b>204</b> corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application.

In this case, “played” edge <b>206</b> corresponds to an action performed by an external application (SPOTIFY) on an external audio file (the song “Imagine”).

As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge <b>206</b> may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively, another edge <b>206</b> may represent each type of relationship (or multiples of a single relationship) between a user node <b>202</b> and a concept node <b>204</b> (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> between user node <b>202</b> for user “E” and concept node <b>204</b> for “SPOTIFY”).</p></li><li><para-num num="[0027]"></para-num><p id="p-0028" num="0027" class="description-line">In particular embodiments, social-networking system <b>160</b> may create an edge <b>206</b> between a user node <b>202</b> and a concept node <b>204</b> in social graph <b>200</b>.

In particular embodiments, connected devices <b>304</b> receive content from MSOs <b>302</b> or OTT providers <b>303</b> while receiving or sending social data to social-networking system <b>160</b>.
