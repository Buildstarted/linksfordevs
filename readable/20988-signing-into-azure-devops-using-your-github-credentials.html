One way we are accomplishing that is by providing a range of products and services covering all stages of the software development lifecycle. This includes IDEs and DevOps tools, application and data platforms on the cloud, operating systems, Artificial Intelligence and IoT solutions, and more. All of these are centered around developers, both as individuals working in teams and organizations, and as members of developer communities.</p><p>GitHub is one of the largest developer communities, and for millions of developers around the world their GitHub identity has become a critical aspect of their digital life. Recognizing that, we’re excited to announce improvements that will help GitHub users get started more easily with our developer services, including <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/">Azure DevOps</a> and Azure.</p><h1>Your GitHub credentials can now log you in to Microsoft services</h1><p>Today, we are enabling developers to sign in with their existing GitHub account to Microsoft online services, on any Microsoft log in page. Using your GitHub credentials, you can now sign in via OAuth anywhere a personal Microsoft account does, including Azure DevOps and Azure.</p><p><img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/pic_2.png" alt="GitHub sign in button in Microsoft login page" width="385" height="350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56377" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/pic_2.png 589w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/pic_2-300x272.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px"></p><p>You will see the option to sign in with your GitHub account by clicking on “Sign in with GitHub”.</p><p>After signing into GitHub and authorizing the Microsoft application, you will get a new Microsoft account that is linked to your GitHub identity. During this process, you also have the opportunity to link it to an existing Microsoft account if you already have one.</p><h1>Sign-in to Azure DevOps</h1><p>Azure DevOps offers a suite of services for developers to help them plan, build, and ship, any app. With support for GitHub authentication, we are making it easier to get started with services such Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (Azure Pipelines); agile planning (Azure Boards); and storage for private packages such as modules for NuGet, npm, PyPi, etc (Azure Artifacts). The Azure DevOps suite is free for individuals and small teams of up to five.</p><p>To get started with Azure DevOps using your GitHub account, click on “Start free using GitHub” in the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/">Azure DevOps</a> page.</p><p><img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/hero.png" alt="Azure DevOps sign in with GitHub" width="961" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-56387" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/hero.png 1196w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/hero-300x156.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/hero-768x399.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/hero-1024x533.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 961px) 100vw, 961px"></p><p>Once you complete the sign-in process, you will be taken directly to the last Azure DevOps organization you visited. If you’re brand new to Azure DevOps, you’ll land to a new organization created for you.</p><h1>Access all of Microsoft online services</h1><p>In addition to accessing developer services such as Azure DevOps and Azure, your GitHub account can be used to access all Microsoft online services, from Excel Online to Xbox.</p><p>When authenticating with those services, you can find your GitHub account after clicking on “Sign-in options”.</p><p><img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/pic_3.png" alt="Click on Sign-in options in the login page for non-developer Microsoft services" width="1098" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56378" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/pic_3.png 1400w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/pic_3-300x109.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/pic_3-768x280.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/pic_3-1024x373.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1098px) 100vw, 1098px"></p><h1>Our commitment to your privacy</h1><p>When you first use your GitHub account to sign in with Microsoft, GitHub will ask for permission to release your profile information.</p><p>If you consent, GitHub will share the email addresses on your GitHub account (both public and private) as well as profile information, like your name. We’ll use this data to check if you already have an account with us or to create a new account if you don’t. Connecting your GitHub identity to a Microsoft one does not give Microsoft access to your repositories in GitHub. Apps like Azure DevOps or Visual Studio will request access to your repositories separately if they need to work with your code, which you’ll need to consent to separately.</p><p>While your GitHub account is used to log into your Microsoft account, they’re still separate entities – one just uses the other as a login method. Changes you make to your GitHub account (like changing the password or enabling two-factor authentication) won’t change your Microsoft account, and vice versa. You can manage the connection between your GitHub and Microsoft identities in your <a href="https://account.live.com/proofs/manage/">account management page</a>, under the Security tab.</p><h1>Start exploring Azure DevOps now</h1><p>Go to the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/">Azure DevOps</a> page and click “Start Free with GitHub” to get started.</p><p>If you have questions, check out <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4501231/microsoft-account-link-your-github-account">this support page</a>.
