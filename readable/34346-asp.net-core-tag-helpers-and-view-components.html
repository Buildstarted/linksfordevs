I'm a part-time Docs writer for Microsoft, part-time author, part-time conference organizer, and full-time learner. Both Tag Helpers and view components make developing ASP.NET Core apps easier than ever. They are both new to ASP.NET Core and are based on years of feedback from our community to the ASP.NET team. Though Tag Helpers are the main focus of this course, you'll also learn about view components and how they leverage the Razor view engine for enhanced HTML manipulation. Some of the major topics that we will cover include authoring our own Tag Helpers, using the Tag Helpers the ASP.NET team built for us, using Tag Helper components for more advanced scenarios, and, finally, building our own JavaScript manager using advanced Tag Helper features including dependency injection. By the end of this course, you'll not only know how to build your own Tag Helpers and view components, but you'll be able to use and extend the built-in ones with advanced knowledge of how they work. Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Core. I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers and view components at Pluralsight.</p></div></div></div></div>
