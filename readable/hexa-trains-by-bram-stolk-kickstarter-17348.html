<p>Trains are pretty awesome. So are hexagons. And trains running on a hexagon planet are just bliss. I have been developing a prototype simulation that sets trains in a charming hex-planet environment. This prototype screams to be developed and released as a full game.</p>
<p>Imagine tycoon-like gaming, set in a fresh new environment. In Hex Trains, you will find beautiful procedurally-generated planets made of countless hexagons (and 12 pentagons.) You explore the continents, lay the tracks, build the stations, open up commercial lines. And in a relaxing atmosphere you will get to enjoy the (hopefully smooth) operation of your transportation enterprise.</p>
<p>In my vision, the planet will be a living, breathing environment, where you, the player, calls the shots on the rail roads. An intricate simulation of a globe that serves as your playground.</p>

<p>My name is Bram Stolk, an indie-game developer from Vancouver, Canada. And just the right person to make this game a reality. My game-development experience is extensive. I create my games on top of my own game-engine technology, and specialize in simulations. In my <a href="https://stolk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game-portfolio</a> you will find a large collection of indiegames, the most famous of which is `The Little Crane That Could' which has been downloaded 19M+ times, primarily on mobile. I have also developed games for Steam.</p>

<p>The prototype is built on top of my own engine, written in C/C++. This engine sits on top of SDL2 and OpenGL. The prototype currently runs on 64bit Linux, and during the execution of the project, will be ported to 64bit MSWindows. The engine already runs on MSWindows.</p>

<p>The planet will feature a simulated economy, where transportation services have simulated supply and demand. The player will have to manage finances, and develop profitable lines of transport. There will be a feedback loop between the development of cities, and its transportation service. Stronger transportation and bigger cities go hand in hand.</p>
<p>The trains will have simulated capabilities, taking acceleration and braking into account, and the capability for climbing inclines of the terrain.</p>
<p>The departure schedule at the stations will also be under the player's control, where a frequent departure schedule will be rewarded with more demand by travelers. This will be at higher operational costs, of course.</p>
<p>To have variable difficulty, there will be a setting that controls how easy bank credit is, and at what interest rates the play can use this credit.</p>

<p>The funds from the kickstarter will be used on engineering, to build the prototype into a full game. Unless funding exceeds target, the art for the game will be the existing programmer art. If ample funding is available, a professional artists will be contracted.</p>

<p>And this is where you come in, dear gamer. Bringing a game to market takes considerable time and money. It's one thing to build technology, it's another to build a product. With your help, this lovingly created simulated world will come to a main stream store for Windows and Linux gaming. The best thing you can do to help me make this is by sharing this project on your social media account. Spread the word to your friends and family. The next best thing you can do is join the crowd in funding Hexa Trains.</p>

<p><span>How are the digital copies of the game distributed?</span></p>
<p><span>This will most likely be via Steam, or possibly itch.</span></p>
<p><span>For what platforms?</span></p>
<p><span>The game will be available for Windows and Linux. If funding goals are significantly exceeded, mobile may be targeted as well.</span></p>
<p><span>What are the minimal hardware specifications?</span></p>
<p><span>This game will run on modest hardware, but will require a 64bit OS, and OpenGL support.</span></p>
<p><span>Is the game single player or multi player?</span></p>
<p><span>The game will almost certainly be single player, unless ample funding becomes available.</span></p>
<p><span>How big is the planet?</span></p>
<p><span>The planet comes in several sizes. The largest of which has 21872 tiles.</span></p>
