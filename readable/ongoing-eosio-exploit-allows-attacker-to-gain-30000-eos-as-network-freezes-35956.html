This resulted in the EOSIO network ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù as thousands of EOS were fed to the attacker‚Äôs wallet, as confirmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/rektkid_/status/1172595110237921281?s=20">another source</a>.</span></p><p><span>For 300 EOS, worth a little over $1,000, the attacker was able to make away with 30,000 EOS tokens, said </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thejaredmoore"><span>Jared Moore</span></a><span> to CryptoSlate, an active community member.
