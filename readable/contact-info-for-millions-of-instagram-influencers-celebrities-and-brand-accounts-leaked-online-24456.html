</p><p> The database, which was hosted by Amazon Web Services and contains more than 49 million records, was accessible without a password or other credentials according to the security researcher who informed <em>TechCrunch</em> about the leak.
</p><p> Records include public data pulled from Instagram, such as profile picture, biography, and follower numbers, but also private contact information like phone numbers and email addresses.
</p><p> Records also calculated the "worth" of each account based on follower count, engagement, reach, likes, and shares.
</p><p> The database was initially uploaded and shared by Mumbai-based social media marketing firm Chtrbox, a company that pays Instagram influencers to share sponsored content. Though uploaded by Chtrbox, the database includes info from influencers who have never worked with the company.</p><blockquote>TechCrunch found several high-profile influencers in the exposed database, including prominent food bloggers, celebrities and other social media influencers.
<p> We contacted several people at random whose information was found in the database and provided them their phone numbers. Two of the people responded and confirmed their email address and phone number found in the database was used to set up their Instagram accounts. Neither had any involvement with Chtrbox, they said.</p></blockquote><p>After hearing from <em>TechCrunch</em>, Chtrbox took the database offline, but the company's CEO did not respond to a request for comment on how the data was obtained.
</p><p> Instagram parent company Facebook said that it was looking into the issue and aiming to determine whether the data was from Instagram or other sources. "We're also inquiring with Chtrbox to understand where this data came from and how it became publicly available," said Facebook.</p></div></div></div>
