            Click squares in the grid to form a pattern. You can extend your pattern by clicking the "Extend" or "Copy" buttons. The "Extend" button will simply add one bar (16 steps)
            to your pattern, while "Copy" will copy the last bar of your pattern. To adjust controls (sound synthesis parameters), click the dials, hold the mouse button down, and move
            your mouse up and down to adjust to the desired value.

            <h2>Sharing and Browsing</h2>
            The browsing tab allows you to view creations shared by other users of MusicToy, and the sharing tab allows you to share your own creations online.
            Sharing a piece will allow other users to view it and edit it. Other users will also be able to share modified versions of your shared creations.

            <h2>MIDI Support</h2>
            MIDI support works with the Chrome browser, but does not yet exist in Firefox. MusicToy will automatically connect to input devices when the page is loaded.
            You can control various values using knobs and faders on a MIDI controller. The controls are mapped based on the default layout of the Novation Launch Control.

        <div id="tab_about" class="tabcontent"><h1>MusicToy 2.0 - Online Grid Sequencer and Synthesizer</h1><h2>Creating MusicToy</h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
            I wanted to build a music creation tool that is easy to use, accessible and free. MusicToy is a synthesizer and
            step-sequencer that runs in a browser,
            meaning you don't even need to download and install any software to use it. Its interface is designed to be
            minimalistic and simple, so as not to put off beginners. The sharing feature gives you the ability to instantly
            put your work online. My hope is that this will enable sharing of creative ideas and encourage cooperation between
            people, producing a positive feedback loop.

            </p><h2>The Author</h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">
            My name is Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert. I am passionate about computers, technology and electronic music. You can reach me via
            twitter, my handle is </p><a href="https://twitter.com/Love2Code">@Love2Code</a><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">.

            </p><h2>Support MusicToy</h2><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">

            I created MusicToy in my spare time and intend for it to remain free to use. Your support can help
            pay for server costs and fund the ongoing development of a new, much more capable version of this tool.
            If you enjoy MusicToy and would like to support its continued development, you can donate via PayPal.
            Any contribution is welcome.
