It’s also open-ended enough that there are lots of ways to go about it. Find a way to randomly generate a maze, and then create an algorithm that will navigate through the maze and successfully reach the maze’s exit. A popular method to accomplish both is the genetic algorithm, a not-quite-brute-force way of training your program to solve problems (which means you’re making AI!). Bob Nystrom has a particularly great guide on generating mazes and dungeons.</p><p><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=maze">#maze</a><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=generator">#generator</a></p></div></div><div><div><p>A 9GAG copy cat</p><p>You don’t always need to try to reinvent the wheel when creating your own projects. Simple projects like a site that lets you login, post photos, GIFs, and lets you scroll through a feed, provides an opportunity to create a solid base site first. Then you can add lots of interesting features like following, liking, and search.</p><p><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=9gag">#9gag</a><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=copy">#copy</a></p></div></div><div><div><p>A What to Code? copy cat</p><p>You don’t always need to try to reinvent the wheel when creating your own projects.

But you would get a better understand of how the server works if you implement one on your own. Learn socket programming and try to give it a shot and see if you can serve web pages</p><p><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=server">#server</a><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=socket">#socket</a></p></div></div><div><div><p>Virtual Pet Simulator</p><p>For those who are missing the cute factor in their work, a virtual pet simulator is a fun standard project. First pick a type of creature like an animal or some type of monster to design, but beginners can start with a basic circle to represent the pet. Once you’ve chosen your concept, give your pet a name, age, and other properties like health and happiness. You might also want to keep in mind physics concepts like movement, gravity, and inertia. Depending on your experience and whether you’re opting for a 2D or 3D model, your pet and its background can come many different ways. You can also customize features on your pet, like programming specific responses to stimuli. This is a great project because you can continuously revisit and improve as you develop your skills.</p><p><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=simulator">#simulator</a><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=pet">#pet</a></p></div></div><div><div><p>Invoice and contract management system</p><p>Contract and invoice management are very complex processes. Contracts can have a lot of nuanced clauses and stipulations that can be difficult to track.
This makes this a very good project, even if you simplify it to some of its core components. Having to translate a complex business process into software is not easy. But it is what makes this project a good challenge.
Again, we wouldn’t overcomplicate this. Take a basic feature, like inputting the terms of a contract, and develop this part first. Then you can add other features like invoice tracking, contract analytics and forecasting.</p><p><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=management">#management</a><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=contract">#contract</a><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=invoice">#invoice</a></p></div></div><div><div><p>A programming language</p><p>Make a parser for simple expressions like CallFunction(Argument1, Argument2), variables, maybe some loops, return statements and more.</p></div></div><div><div><p>A grid-based fluid/sand simulation</p><p>Each particle falls to the ground if nothing is beneath it, but fluids flow to the closest hole.</p><p><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=Simulation">#Simulation</a></p></div></div><div><div><p>A JSON encoder/decoder</p><p>JSON is JavaScript's perhaps most important contribution to Computer Science. Many programming languages have a library for serializing its native data structures to JSON and back, but rolling your own can be an interesting exercise. Try following the standard to the letter so you can reuse the code as a library later on but feel free to add optional features that can be enabled.</p><p><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=Parsing">#Parsing</a><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=Encoding">#Encoding</a><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=Decoding">#Decoding</a></p></div></div><div><div><p>Recipe</p><p>You might not have realized this, but recipe’s are nothing more than culinary algorithms. Like programs, recipe’s are a series of imperative steps which, if followed correctly, result in a tasty dish.
The objective of the Recipe app is to help the user manage recipes in a way that will make them easy to follow.</p><p><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=recipe">#recipe</a><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=management">#management</a></p></div></div><div><div><p>Clone GNU coreutils</p><p>Implement your own echo, cat, wc, head, tail, and whatever other popular command line utilities you can find! Great for learning a languages standard library, as you need I/O, argument parsing, and lots of string processing </p><p><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=unix">#unix</a><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=coreutils">#coreutils</a></p></div></div><div><div><p>Snake</p><p>If you had a cellphone in the early 2000s, you’ve probably played Snake. It’s a simple game but you can always try to make things more complex! First, start by just trying to make the game.</p><p><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=games">#games</a><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=snake">#snake</a><a href="https://what-to-code.com/?tag=game">#game</a></p></div></div><div><div><p>Code a Compression Algorithm</p><p>Start small implementing RLE and test on a few log files.
It can get quite complicated with Hoffman Coding.
