Actions makes it possible to create simple, yet powerful pipelines and automate software compilation and delivery. Today, we are announcing the preview of GitHub Actions for Azure.</p><p>With these new Actions, developers can quickly build, test, and deploy code from GitHub repositories to the cloud with Azure.</p><p>You can find our first set of Actions grouped into four repositories on GitHub, each one containing documentation and examples to help you use GitHub for CI/CD and deploy your apps to Azure.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Azure/actions" target="_blank">azure/actions (login)</a>: Authenticate with an Azure subscription.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Azure/appservice-actions" target="_blank">azure/appservice-actions</a>: Deploy apps to Azure App Services using the features Web Apps and Web Apps for Containers.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Azure/container-actions" target="_blank">azure/container-actions</a>: Connect to container registries, including Docker Hub and Azure Container Registry, as well as build and push container images.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Azure/k8s-actions" target="_blank">azure/k8s-actions</a>: Connect and deploy to a Kubernetes cluster, including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).</li></ul><h2>Connect to Azure</h2><p>The login action (<code>azure/actions</code>) allows you to securely connect to an Azure subscription.</p><p>The process requires using a service principal, which can be generated using the Azure CLI, as per <a href="https://github.com/Azure/actions#usage-instructions" target="_blank">instructions</a>. Use the GitHub Actions’ built-in <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank">secret store</a> for safely storing the output of this command.</p><p>If your workflow involves containers, you can also use the <code><tt>azure/k8s-actions/docker-login</tt></code> and <code>azure/container-actions/aks-set-context</code> Actions for connecting to Azure services like Container Registry and AKS respectively.</p><p>These Actions help setting the context for the rest of the workflow. For example, once you have used <code>azure/container-actions/docker-login</code>, the next set of Actions in the workflow can perform tasks such as building, tagging, and pushing container images to Container Registry.</p><h2>Deploy a web app</h2><p>Azure App Service is a managed platform for deploying and scaling web applications. You can easily deploy your web app to Azure App Service with the <code>azure/appservice-actions/webapp</code> and <code>azure/appservice-actions/webapp-container</code> Actions.</p><p>The <code>azure/appservice-actions/webapp</code> action takes the app name and the path to an archive (*.zip, *.war, *.jar) or folder to deploy.</p><p>The <code>azure/appservice-actions/webapp-container</code> supports deploying containerized apps, including multi-container ones. When combined with <code>azure/container-actions/docker-login</code>, you can create a complete workflow which builds a container image, pushes it to Container Registry and then deploys it to Web Apps for Containers.</p><h2>Deploy to Kubernetes</h2><p><code>azure/k8s-actions/k8s-deploy</code> helps you connect to a Kubernetes cluster, bake and deploy manifests, substitute artifacts, check rollout status, and handle secrets within AKS.</p><p>The <code>azure/k8s-actions/k8s-create-secret</code> action takes care of creating Kubernetes secret objects, which help you manage sensitive information such as passwords and API tokens. These notably include the Docker-registry secret, which is used by AKS itself to pull a private image from a registry. This action makes it possible to populate the Kubernetes cluster with values from the GitHub Actions’ built-in secret store.</p><p>Our container-centric Actions, including those for Kubernetes and for interacting with a Docker registry, aren’t specific to Azure, and can be used with any Kubernetes cluster, including self-hosted ones, running on-premises or on other clouds, as well as any Docker registry.</p><p><a href="https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/f3543a56-8158-44f9-a57e-157f9e783a59.png"><img alt="Azure Actions for GitHub" border="0" height="1093" src="https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/6ba3c6de-4886-4fd4-89d1-73425115b115.png" title="Azure Actions for GitHub" width="1918"></a></p><h2>Full example</h2><p>Here is an example of an end-to-end workflow which builds a container image, pushes it to Container Registry and then deploys to an AKS cluster by using manifest files.</p><pre>on: [push]

In the next few months we will continue improving upon our available Actions, and we will release new ones to cover more Azure services.</p><p>Please try out the GitHub Actions for Azure and share your feedback via Twitter on <a href="https://twitter.com/azuredevops" target="_blank">@AzureDevOps</a>, or using <a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/21/index.html" target="_blank">Developer Community</a>. If you encounter a problem during the preview, please open an issue on the GitHub repository for the specific action.</p></div></div></div></div>
