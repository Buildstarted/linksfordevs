										Both companies and players should care about good netcode because <strong>playing online is no longer the future -- it's the present</strong>. 
								</p><p>
										While most other video game genres have been this way for a decade or longer, fighting game developers seem to be resistant to embracing online play, perhaps because of the genre’s roots in offline settings such as arcades and tournaments. Playing offline is great, and it will always have considerable value in fighting games, but it’s simply a reality that <strong>a large percentage of the player base will never play offline</strong>. For many fighting game fans, playing online <em>is</em> the game, and a bad online experience prevents them from getting better, playing or recommending the game to their friends, and ultimately causes them to <a href="https://youtu.be/iTUtnclr2hs?t=758">simply go do something else</a>.
								</p><p>
										Even if you think you have a good connection, or live in an area of the world with robust internet infrastructure, good netcode is still mandatory. Plus, lost or delayed information happens regularly even on the best networks, and poor netcode can <a href="https://twitter.com/john_takeuchi/status/1162562266027327488">actively hamper matches</a> no matter how smooth the conditions may be. Good netcode also has the benefit of connecting regions across greater distances, effectively uniting the global player base as much as possible.
