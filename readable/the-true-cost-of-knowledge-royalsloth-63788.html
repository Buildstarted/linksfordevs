<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A while ago I was pulled into a discussion about the speed and magic optimizations
of a particular container within the standard library of a coworker’s programming
language of choice. They were claiming how there is a special container
that somehow magically performs better than a normal array when it’s used for
adding a number to every element within that container.</p><p>For some reason in a corporate world you will always find such pieces
of wisdom floating around. The standard library is treated as some kind of a
magic box that performs an order of magnitude better than whatever you could
ever program yourself.</p><p>I don’t believe in witchcraft though. A memory access is a memory access and unless you figure out
a more efficient algorithm for performing your operation, this magic container
is not going to perform any faster. So I convinced this person to write an actual program that will compare their magic
container with an every day array. Lo’ and behold my favorite
optimization technique that could be summed as “when in doubt use a for loop
and iterate over array” proved to be right. The thing compiled into more or
less the same thing, while an array solution performed slightly better on average.</p><p>It just goes to show how the software industry excels at regurgitating myths instead
of sitting down and thinking really hard about the problem at hand. I partially
blame this culture on the pervasive money making industry, which likes to spoon
feed scholars with random bits of trivia instead of actually making them think.
You also know it under the name of higher education.</p><p>When you know nothing at all, being spoon fed the knowledge is a great way to become
aware of the vast field around you. As soon as you gather enough knowledge to be dangerous,
you start to realize how Gell-Mann amnesia effect is a real thing and most
of the world is broken [1].</p><p>Since young people are being spoon fed knowledge for a tremendously large chunk of their life,
they are prone to simply accept random pieces of “knowledge” that they found on some random
blog as facts and rules to live by. These bits of knowledge are then accumulated
and moving forward through osmosis, until it gets to the point
where people believe into voodoo computer operations that are somehow
inaccessible to the mere mortals.</p><h2 id="how-expensive-is-knowledge">How expensive is knowledge?</h2><p>If you live in a relatively well organized society, then the knowledge is
actually free or at least priced at the point which you could consider as free.</p><p>Formal education in my country is “free”. It’s not quite free as we pay for
it with a relatively high taxes, but it’s free
in a way where anyone could be attending any school regardless of their income or
social status. All of the university lectures are also public and free to attend
by anyone from the streets. That usually doesn’t happen, but it’s still an option
for someone that is willing to listen and learn something new.</p><p>Despite spending more than 15 years in school, I didn’t really learn much there.
It’s one thing learning about the internals of this specific thing that you are
interested in, whereas abstract learning about general stuff was not
that interesting for me. I was introduced to a few new concepts and
I learned a great deal of math which I never used later on,
but that was pretty much it [2]. It was as if my brain was made out of Teflon and
whatever they threw at it didn’t stick. Oh, well…</p><p>The main problem that I see with the modern formal education is in that they
are trying to compact the ever growing knowledge into chunks that you
should memorize and repeat when asked, which keeps you busy so your
parents are able to work. They treat your brain as a hard drive
for dumping facts, while in reality it is a self-programmable high performance
CPU with infinite potential that is preserving data rather poorly.
In case you are wondering, this wordy description means that your brain
is far far away from the dumping ground of facts, but it excels at making
abstract connections and general never seen before type of problem solving.</p><p>As Richard Hamming put it in his excellent
<a href="https://blog.royalsloth.eu/articles/you-and-your-research/">You and Your Research</a> talk:</p><blockquote><p>But I am inclined to believe that, in the long-haul, books which leave out
what’s not essential are more important than books which tell you everything
because you don’t want to know everything. I don’t want to know that much
about penguins is the usual reply. You just want to know the essence.</p><p>Richard Hamming</p></blockquote><p>Learning facts and dates when somebody discovered something is not that useful
in a world where all this knowledge is 1 click away.
It’s good for those occasions when you have to mingle and impress the
audience at your gala table, but other than that it’s mostly taking away your
brain space that could be used for solving more important problems than mere
memorization. The amount of knowledge absolutely exploded in the past
100 years and you cannot possibly cram all that junk into that
tiny brain compartment.</p><p>Of course, this statement will enrage the people from the land of the free
who spent thousands on their education, while at the same time most of the
things are better explained elsewhere. I had a pretty good math teacher, but
you can find thousand times better lectures on the internet made by strangers
who are educating others from the goodness of their heart, such as
<a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">3blue1brown</a>. And best of all, they are free.</p><h2 id="where-does-the-knowledge-come-from">Where does the knowledge come from?</h2><p>Most of the things that I’ve accumulated over the years came from this mildly
amusing idea that we call the internet. I had English classes in school,
but I actually learned English while playing online games and mindlessly
browsing internet. Nowadays I am mostly communicating in English, despite
not being a native speaker. Who knew that wasting time on the internet would
be so useful one day? I most certainly did not.</p><p>But, where did you learn about computer stuff?</p><ul><li><p>I learned how to program via shitty online tutorials and building useless
websites. Building a crappy website with just your mind and a text editor
was a mind blowing experience.</p></li><li><p>I learned how to manage Linux servers by tinkering with an old crappy
laptop and endlessly broken Linux system. Also I pushed those useless
websites there and played with the system until the website appeared
in the browser.</p></li><li><p>I learned the rest by reading books on a particular topic that interested
me and later on talking to my coworkers.</p></li></ul><p>The actual knowledge came from spending thousands of hours
in front of a computer just trying things out and playing with
already discovered concepts. I may as well formulate this insight as:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">great work = spoon fed knowledge + experience + magic sauce</code></pre></div><p>The parameters of this equation are also listed in a chronological order, as
they appear throughout the life:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Spoon fed knowledge</strong>: obtained through formal education, reading books, online
tutorials and picking brains of experienced people.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experience</strong>: given enough spoon fed knowledge and plenty of hours, that
knowledge is turned into experience. Suddenly you are mildly aware of what
works and what doesn’t based on the past scars.</p></li><li><p><strong>Magic sauce</strong>: a mix that consists of your own thoughts, experience and
inspiration that brewed over the years. You might as well fit this into the
realm of creativity.</p></li></ol><p>You are free to throw some insanity into the mix to make it pop.</p><h2 id="which-book-should-i-read-next">Which book should I read next?</h2><p>Writing this question into your search engine of choice will provide hundreds
of thousands results for the list of top 10 books on “X” that will
help your career and change your perspective forever.
All of those lists are accompanied with a
tiny note telling you that the author is associated with a “$LARGE_BOOK_STORE” and buying them
through their links will somehow help them run their blog in order to publish
more of those useful lists.</p><p>I checked my library of dead tree items and found 15 technical books which
I bought and read multiple times over the past few years. Most of them were pretty good
and they were extremely valuable for my career. Reading a deep dive into the
topic you are interested in is a great investment and you should definitely read
as much as possible.</p><p>Still, I can’t really suggest you to read any of those books that I bought.
They were all a great investment up to some point.
Then one day you reach the level when you realize that the knowledge from those
books only apply up to a certain point, and sticking to whatever the book authors
have to say is actually a bad idea for your specific case.</p><p>Sometimes you even realize that what the book authors are preaching is
actually harmful and is in fact hurting the entire industry by poisoning the bright
minds with false ideas. Like the advice from a well known person B. “Sell Books” M.
that is preaching how the comments are harmful and a big code smell.</p><p>The advice is totally fine and yes, you should most definitely structure your program in a way where
the code is self explanatory. Then one day you happen to work on one of
those multi million lines long codebase where people kept this advice close to
their hearts. After a few years the original developers are long gone and nobody knows how the damn thing works and why
a certain architectural decisions were made. Nothing makes sense and the documentation
does not reflect the current state, but the code sure is clean with none of those smelly little comments.</p><p>The zealots will argue how people misunderstood the book and that it only
pushed people towards improving the structure of the program as opposed to writing
lengthy comments. The result was naturally the exact opposite. People are
hesitant to write comments because writing comments has become this big bad wolf
and you should be afraid of the big bad wolf.</p><p>The best code that I have ever written to this date contains a lot of comments.
In fact ~30% of that particular codebase consists of comments. The feedback that
I got from the current maintainers was mostly on how easy it
is to jump into it and update the business logic, because all the unknowns
and possible future pitfalls are explained right there. So there is that [3].</p><p>In comparison to math, the software world is not a really well defined thing.
In math you have these long equations full of weird hieroglyphs and as
long as you put the right stuff in, you get the right stuff out.
Everything is exactly defined and proven and there is no misconception
on how the things should behave (unless you are trying to divide by zero,
then all bets are off).</p><p>The software world feels closer to creative writing. Sure there are rules
and best practices in regards to how the hardware behaves, but when it comes
to actually defining the structure of your program, it’s no longer a well
defined thing. Maybe we should write it like this or maybe we shouldn’t - who knows?
In the end it all boils down to experience and personal preferences of the
author, which is why we still have these decades long debates about comments, tabs
vs spaces and other nonsense.</p><p>Do I consider that particular book a bad book? Yes and no. It was definitely
helpful for me when I’ve read it for the first time, as it made me think
about the structure of my programs and how that structure affects other people
in the team. Still, I don’t consider
it as the holy bible of programming type of book that everyone should
read and stick to whatever is written in there. There is a lot of fluff and
bad advice that conflicts with the examples that are presented there.
As long as you treat it as just another opinion piece or tool in your
toolbox, you will be just fine.</p><p>But if you truly care about your craft, then I do have a special book for you in mind.
It’s called <a href="https://blog.royalsloth.eu/the-world-through-the-eyes-of-a-sloth/">The world through the eyes of a sloth</a>
that I just happen to be selling right here and you can buy it
for a mere $39.26. You can’t really call yourself a professional without
reading this one, that’s for sure.</p><p>Ok, let’s not get derailed with bashing the book sellers here. Now where was I?
Ah yes, the cost of knowledge. How much do you think those 15 books actually
cost me?</p><p>Given the average book about programming costs ~$32 that would be:</p><p>Even if you don’t live in a country with inflated engineering salaries,
this is a great bargain. Gaining this amount of experience on your own would cost
you 10-20 years of full time programming. On the other hand you can gain it in a
couple of years that reading this amount of books will take you, together
with practicing the things that you have read.</p><p>In reality the actual cost of those books is even lower. Some of the best books
out there could be read for free on the author’s website. Libraries are still a thing.
If you pull out your pirate hat from the closet then you can actually get all
of them for free. Either way, if you have the funds please compensate the authors for their
hard work. Writing lengthy books or articles like this one is hard and
time consuming.</p><p>In essence of this section, even if you don’t have the “right” formal education
and all odds are against you, you can make it just fine in the modern world
as the knowledge is essentially free and just waiting to be picked. But you do
pay for it with years of study [4].</p><h2 id="mastery">Mastery</h2><p>If the knowledge is free, then why do we have these weird office debates
all the time? Why do educated people believe in the magic of the libraries
for their programming language of choice?</p><p>Why rarely anybody goes from the first principles and really thinks about
the stuff that happens under the hood when your for loop iterates over an array?
What happens if your for loop iterates over a linked list? What if it iterates
over a magic array like container?</p><p>I don’t know. I guess passing the knowledge from the teacher to scholar is hard
and despite all the technological advances we didn’t quite figure it out yet.
And it’s not only that passing this knowledge is hard. Some teachers are just
poor at their job and some scholars are not willing to listen
and prefer to live in the world of magic libraries.
Transforming this ever growing knowledge into the actual understanding
is a tremendous amount of hard work. It usually takes years before you
really get it and master the subject [5].</p><p>On top of all that, the software industry is riddled with used ol’ vacuum
cleaner salesmen that are trying to get their part of the pie. They keep
making these beginner friendly Javascript courses that are promising to
turn you into a master craftsman in a matter of hours.</p><p>It’s a crowded bar where everybody is yelling, but nobody has anything
of value to say. Filtering out that noise is hard and it again takes years
before you are able to recognize signal from the noise.</p><p>So how does one becomes the master of their field?</p><blockquote><p>All I want to do is make a better sushi. I do the same thing over and over,
improving bit by bit. There is always a yearning to achieve more. I’ll continue
to climb, trying to reach the top, but nobody knows where the top is.</p><p>Even at my age, after decades of work I don’t think I have achieved perfection.</p><p>Jiro the sushi master (at the age of 86)</p></blockquote><p>You live and you learn.</p><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><p>[1] Gell-Mann amnesia - a phenomenon of experts believing news
articles on topics outside of their fields of expertise, even after acknowledging
that articles written in the same publication that are within expert’s field of
expertise are error-ridden and full of misunderstanding.</p><p>A younger me had a programming problem and so I searched around for the solution.
The first link was this great site called StackOverflow that was filled with
great solutions to my problem. Amazing.</p><p>One day I woke up and realized that most of the answers on that site
were actually just plain wrong. While the answers posted there did solve the problem
that the asker was having, most of them were never stating the
pitfalls of their approach. If you don’t know a lot about that particular topic,
you don’t even realize that you are copying a flawed approach into your
production code.</p><p>Until one day your program is crashing, due to running out of memory.
Oops you are copying a 4Gb chunk of memory multiple times, because that was
the solution that someone provided on StackOverflow and you didn’t know any
better at the time. The accepted solution worked for the asker’s tiny problem,
but it bit you in the ass for your slightly larger one.</p><p>[2] But then again I didn’t study computer science, so maybe that’s why
most of it was not that much useful for me.</p><p>[3] You might want to read a more in depth blog post on <a href="http://antirez.com/news/124">Writing system software: code comments</a>
from the creator of Redis.</p><p>[4] I am talking here about the actual knowledge and not about on
paper knowledge that you get after finishing a certain course or degree.
While there are professions in which you simply cannot work without
finishing such course and obtaining that paper,
the software industry is not one of those.</p><p>[5] Some say it takes 10 years or 10’000 hours to become proficient in the subject, see
