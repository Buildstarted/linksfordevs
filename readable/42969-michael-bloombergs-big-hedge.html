worth millions, if not billions, of dollars need a way to offset the risk of
losing too much of that money. One way to accomplish this is to use a hedge. If
you&#x2019;re betting the market overall is going up, and have millions invested in
that gamble, you might want to spend a smaller amount of money also betting it
goes down. This limits the upside of your original bet, but it also limits your
downside risk. Risk management is never perfect, and the more complicated your
investments, the harder it is to craft a good hedge. But it pays to use your
imagination. Michael Bloomberg stands to lose a considerable amount of money
should a wealth tax be successfully implemented in the United States. His <a href="https://twitter.com/Ad_Analytics/status/1197986788796780544">history-making</a> $34 million ad buy can rightly
be seen as a creative hedge against a wealth tax on his $52 billion-and-growing
fortune.</p><p><span>Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, as well as billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer all take the view that progressive
taxation on its own will be insufficient in ameliorating America&#x2019;s growing income
inequalty. In order to reverse this trajectory, all three have proposed annual
wealth taxes in their presidential platforms. Sanders&#x2019; </span><a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/">Tax on Extreme Wealth</a><span> begins at 1% for single
individuals with wealth over $16 million and caps out at 8% for singles with
wealth over five billion. Warren&#x2019;s </span><a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax">Ultra-Millionaire Tax</a><span> begins at 2% for
households with wealth over $50 million, and rises to 6% for amounts over $1
billion. Steyer has proposed a 1% fee above $32 million. Bloomberg would pay </span><a>$3.7 billion</a><span>&#xA0;,
</span><a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/calculator/ultra-millionaire-tax">$3 billion</a><span>, or $512 million each year under
Sanders&#x2019;, Warren&#x2019;s, and Steyer&#x2019;s proposals, respectively.&#xA0;</span><span>(Calculation for Sander&#x2019;s wealth tax can be found on the</span><span>&#xA0;</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pargTTpte151b6Ywkj-5SrzPpIWN9OSkqTGW5u5cFQE/edit#gid=688429658">first tab of this spreadsheet</a><span>.)</span></p><p><span>Bloomberg&#x2019;s forthcoming&#xA0;</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/22/michael-bloomberg-ad-buy-2020-election-072893">$34 million</a><span> ad purchase, which he plans to
unleash on the world next week, is 1.1% of the amount he&#x2019;d owe each year under
the Warren plan. This is just Bloomberg&#x2019;s initial public offering: He is
prepared to spend between $500 million and $1 billion on the campaign overall,
according to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/AsteadWesley/status/1197991101325619200">Astead Wesley</a><span> of </span><i>The New York Times</i><span>. Even on the high end, this outlay is still just
between 27 and 33 percent of what he&#x2019;d owe in just a single year under either
Sanders&#x2019; or Warren&#x2019;s wealth tax. To offset the risk of his fortune being
diminished, and then appropriated in a democratic process which includes many
mechanisms for accountability, Bloomberg is clearly more than willing to spend
a fraction of what he stands to be taxed.</span></p><p><span>It&#x2019;s a strategy similar to the one employed by
Amazon, owned by fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos, who </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/11/9/20956153/mike-bloomberg-president-2020-jeff-bezos-phone-call-amazon-hq2">encouraged Bloomberg to run</a><span>. Amazon poured </span><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazon-gives-1m-group-seeking-upend-seattle-city-council-upcoming-election/">nearly $1.5 million</a><span> into Seattle&#x2019;s recent City
Council elections, dumping almost </span><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/seattles-upcoming-election-inundated-tech-money-not-just-amazon/">half a million alone</a><span> into supporting socialist
incumbent Kshama Sawant&#x2019;s opponent, Egan Orion. Amazon previously faced a
per-employee &#x201C;head tax&#x201D; that would have cost them </span><a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/06/in-seattle-business-won/562691/">$13 million per year</a><span>. When the tax unanimously
passed the council, Amazon launched a campaign against it, and secured a repeal
in </span><a href="https://truthout.org/articles/in-these-three-races-the-establishment-fought-hard-and-still-lost/">just a single month</a><span>. Their attempt to stave
off a second attempt at this taxation makes perfect mathematical sense&#x2014;why not
spend $1.5 million to potentially avoid paying $11.5 million, or more, in
taxes? Taxes which, it should be noted, would have gone to </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/06/17/after-amazon-tax-fails-seattle-has-no-clear-path-help-homeless/698575002/">fund homeless services</a><span> in the city whose
residents face skyrocketing housing costs due to Amazon&#x2019;s presence. In this
instance, the plutocrats&#x2019; strategy failed to come to fruition. Two of Sawant&#x2019;s
fellow council members, who had </span><a href="https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/04/09/39863222/armed-with-two-council-endorsements-school-board-director-dewolf-takes-on-sawant">backed a challenger</a><span> in the primary and
declined to endorse her in the general, reversed course and </span><a href="https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/10/25/41797198/heidi-willss-flood-of-business-cash-egan-orions-failure-to-report-donations-tucker-carlsons-attack-on-lisa-herbold-and-kshama-sawants-b">endorsed</a><span> Sawant after Amazon turned on their
democracy-distorting money spigot. Even Orion </span><a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/did-amazons-late-spending-sink-the-council-candidates-they-supported">attributed Sawant&#x2019;s victory</a><span> to the Amazon
intervention, saying it was a &#x201C;great gift to the Sawant team.&#x201D; Overall, five of
the seven Amazon-endorsed candidates for the city council lost their elections.</span></p></div></div><div class="article-text-wrap"><div class="article-text-grid"><p><span>Bloomberg, however, is likely not playing to
actually win the election. Rather, he seeks to ensure that the candidates
supporting a wealth tax don&#x2019;t prevail. He hasn&#x2019;t been shy with his public
criticisms of a wealth tax; &#x201C;</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/bloomberg-blasts-pie-sky-green-new-deal-rips-warren-wealth-n964056">It&#x2019;s called Venezuela</a><span>,&#x201D; is his preferred
attack on the proposal. But his considerable fortune is likely sufficient to buy
his way onto the debate stage, although it&#x2019;s unclear if the DNC will </span><a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1198659776068169730">change its own
rules</a><span>, and drop the current requirement for </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/25/dnc-raises-thresholds-for-december-debate-000297">200,000
unique donors</a><span> (Bloomberg is self-funding his campaign). Steyer has already
demonstrated the viability of this strategy by spending </span><a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/P00012716/">$47
million</a><span> of his own money on the election, netting the billionaire
two appearances at Democratic primary debates. Bloomberg is 32 times wealthier
than Steyer. If Bloomberg can use the platform afforded to presidential
candidates for his message that voters actually want &#x201C;</span><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/stephanie-ruhle/watch/how-does-former-nyc-mayor-michael-bloomberg-plan-to-beat-the-nra-65840710002">evolutionary change, not revolutionary change</a><span>,&#x201D;
as he told MSNBC, he might successfully lower the </span><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/nyt-july-2019-cci/">massively popular support</a><span> for a wealth tax.</span></p><p><span>Bloomberg has more at stake than wealth taxes.
Bloomberg made his fortune selling technology to Wall Street through his
privately-owned company Bloomberg L.P.&#xA0;
He created the Bloomberg Terminal, which provides massive amounts of
data, charts, and tools to monitor financial securities of all kinds: from
stocks and bonds to the most obscure derivatives that are traded outside
transparent marketplaces. The terminal also functions as a sort of giant
Instant Messaging platform to Wall Street, where users &#x201C;bloomberg message&#x201D; one
another.&#xA0; While there is competing
technology, it&#x2019;s hard to overstate how ubiquitous this software is in finance.
It&#x2019;s also incredibly expensive, typically costing the average user around </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052815/financial-news-comparison-bloomberg-vs-reuters.asp">$24,000 per year</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>A profitable Wall Street means more
subscriptions to more Bloomberg terminals. But a Warren or Sanders
administration would potentially impose a host of new rules on a wide range of
Wall Street players, which could squeeze banks&#x2019; record profitability and reduce
Bloomberg&#x2019;s own profits. Sanders wants to </span><a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/fair-banking-for-all/">cap</a><span> consumer loans and credit cards at 15%.
Both </span><a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-sanders-and-rep-lee-introduce-inclusive-prosperity-act-to-curb-wall-street-greed_-">Sanders</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/647/cosponsors">Warren</a><span> (and </span><a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/financial-transaction-tax/">Andrew Yang</a><span>) support some version of a tax on
Wall Street trades. And the Stop Wall Street Looting Act&#x2014;a bill that Warren
introduced and which Sanders has co-sponsored&#x2014;would </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/19/20700654/elizabeth-warren-private-equity-wall-street-looting-act">totally rework</a><span> the way private equity does
business, offering more protections to workers whose companies are taken over
by private equity firms, including prioritizing their pay in the bankruptcy
process. The Chamber of Commerce, the nation&#x2019;s largest lobbying organization,
has predictably </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chamber-of-commerce-joins-pushback-against-warrens-private-equity-plan-11573597511">warned</a><span> the bill &#x201C;would poison the well of
innovation and growth.&#x201D; By contrast, Eileen Appelbaum of The Center for
Economic and Policy Research has </span><a href="http://cepr.net/publications/briefings/testimony/letter-from-eileen-appelbaum-to-sen-elizabeth-warren-on-stop-wall-street-looting-act">said</a><span> the bill would halt &#x201C;abusive practices
that wipe out jobs and cripple strong companies.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It is hard to say what the perfect billionaire
hedge against a Warren or Sanders administration would look like. Despite the
abundant fear-mongering among the billionaire class that a Warren or Sanders
president would </span><a href="https://truthout.org/articles/we-already-have-a-wealth-tax-its-just-paid-to-hedge-fund-managers/">cause a drop in the stock market</a><span>, this is a retread of the&#xA0;</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-09-06/obama-is-bad-or-good-for-markets-in-poll-showing-global-division">same alarmism that greeted the Obama administration</a><span>. That prophecy failed to come
to pass, so a simple bet against the S&amp;P 500 probably won&#x2019;t cut it for the
oligarch looking to shield his boodle from the ravages of a more equitable
society. Bloomberg is embarking on a more creative hedge, one that also allows
him to finally realize his long-dreamed desire to run for President. This is a
method that Bloomberg had previously deployed at a smaller scale, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/nyregion/28spending.html">spending $100 million</a><span> (or about $174 per vote)
in his 2009 campaign to be re-elected mayor of New York City.</span></p><p><span>Whatever ultimately happens in Bloomberg&#x2019;s bid
for the presidency, as long as his presence in the race is able to make a dent
in the support for Warren and Sanders, he is further insulating himself from a
future where he&#x2019;d have to pay a single-digit percent of his wealth annually in
taxes. We can likely expect Bloomberg to strike the same wealth-friendly tone
the company he owns does on its &#x201C;About&#x201D; page, which </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/?utm_source=bloomberg-menu&amp;utm_medium=blp">proclaims</a><span> &#x201C;we believe profit and principles
are not mutually exclusive. They reinforce one another.&#x201D;&#xA0; But as one billionaire&#x2019;s presidential run has
already ended in ridicule (remember Howard Schultz?), and the vast majority of
Democratic voters remain </span><a href="https://www.people-press.org/2019/07/18/democrats-ratings-of-partys-2020-field-better-than-in-2016-similar-to-2008/">happy with the existing choices</a><span>, one might
hope Bloomberg would borrow a different section of his company&#x2019;s motto, &#x201C;doing
the right thing,&#x201D; and not run at all.&#xA0;</span></p></div></div></div></div></div>
