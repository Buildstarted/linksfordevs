          <p>“Alexey, do you feel the points you bring up during our post-mortems are productive?” my tech lead asked at our 1:1.</p>

<p>Well, shit. I had thought so, but apparently not.</p>

<p>Earlier in the year, I became the Engineering Manager on a team responsible for half of the outages at our 2,000 person company. After each incident, the on-call engineer would write-up a doc and schedule a meeting.</p>

<p>“How come this wasn’t caught in unit tests?” I found myself asking, in front of the assembled team. Next post-mortem, same thing. “I get that we didn’t have monitoring for this particular metric, but why not?” Week after week.</p>

<p>The tech lead had asked a great question. Was my approach working?</p>

<p>“I want to set high expectations,” I told him. “It’s not pleasant being critiqued in a group setting, but my hope is that the team internalizes my ‘good post-mortem’ bar.”</p>

<p>The words sounded wrong even as I said them.</p>

<p>“Thanks for the feedback.” I said “Let me think on it.”</p>

<h2 id="feedback-budgets">Feedback budgets</h2>
<p>I thought about it.</p>

<p>There’s a limited budget for criticism one can ingest productively in a single sitting. Managers will try to extend this budget through famed best-practices like the shit-sandwich and the not-really-a-question question. Employees learn these approaches over time and develop an immunity.</p>

<p>This happened here. Once my questioning reached the criticism threshold, I was no longer “improving the post-mortem culture.” I was “building resentment and defensiveness”.</p>

<p>I had run over budget. And yet, there was important feedback to give!</p>

<h2 id="change-the-template-change-the-world">Change the template, change the world</h2>
<p>Upon reflection, I ended up <a href="#post-mortem-changes">updating our post-mortem template</a>. My questions became part of the template that got filled in before meeting.</p>

<p>This way, it was the template pestering the post-mortem author. My role was simply to insist that the template be filled out; an entirely reasonable ask.</p>

<p>Surprisingly enough, this worked; post-mortems became more substantive. The team to pared down outage frequency and met OKR goals.</p>

<h2 id="process-linters">Process linters</h2>

<p>One Simple Trick I had stumbled into was that there was a way to get around feedback budgets.
Turns out there’s this other, vaster budget to tap into: the budget of process automation. When feedback is automated, it arrives sooner, feels confidential, and lacks judgement. This makes it palatable; this is why the budget is vaster.</p>

<p>The technical analogy here is how we use linters. “Nit: don’t forget to explicitly handle the return value” during code review feels mildly frustrating. Ugh. It’s “just a style thing” and “the code works”. I’ll make the change, but with slight resentment.</p>

<p>Yet, if that same “unhandled return value” nudge arrives in the form of a linter, it’s a different story. I got the feedback before submitting the code for review; no human had to see my minor incompetence.</p>

<p>As a software engineer, Have Good Linters is an obvious, uncontroversial best practice. The revelatory moment for me was that templates for documents were just another kind of linter.</p>

<h2 id="happy-ending">Happy Ending</h2>

<p>My insight completely transformed the way Opendoor Engineering thinks about feedback; I crowd-surfed, held aloft by the team’s grateful arms, to receive my due praise as the master of all process improvement.</p>

<p>Just kidding; COVID-19 happened and I switched jobs.</p>

<h3 id="the-appendices-three">The Appendices Three</h3>
<h4 id="i-process-linters-seen-in-the-wild">I: Process linters seen in the wild</h4>

<h5 id="meetings">Meetings</h5>
<p>Feedback “we have too many meetings”; “what’s the point of this meeting”; “do I need to be here”
Linter mandate no-meetings days; mandate agendas; mandate a hard max on attendee count.</p>

<h5 id="progress-updates">Progress Updates</h5>
<p>Feedback “Hey, how’s that project going? Haven’t heard from you in a bit”
Linter Daily stand-ups (synchronous or in slack/an app); issue trackers (Linear, Asana, Jira, Trello)</p>

<h5 id="bug-reports">Bug Reports</h5>
<p>Feedback “Hey, a friend who uses the app said that our unsubscribe page is broken?”
Linter Quality pre-deploy test coverage, automated error reporting (Sentry), Alerting on pages or business metrics having anomalous activity patterns (Datadog).</p>

<h4 id="ii-youve-gone-too-far-with-this-process-crap">II: You’ve gone too far with this process crap</h4>

<p>The process budget is vaster than the feedback budget, but it isn’t unlimited. A mature company is going to have lots of legacy process - process debt, if you will.</p>

<p>Process requires maintenance and pruning, to avoid “we do this because we’ve always done this” type problems. High-process managers are just as likely to generate unhappy employees as high-feedback managers.</p>


<h4 id="iii-the-post-mortem-template-changes-if-thats-what-youre-here-for">III: The post-mortem template changes, if that’s what you’re here for</h4>

<h5 id="a-5-whys-prompts">A. “5 Whys” Prompts</h5>
<p>Our original 5 Whys prompt was “Why did this outage occur.”  During the post-mortem review, I kept asking questions like “but why didn’t this get caught in regression testing?”</p>

<p>So, after discussion, I added my evergreen questions to the post-mortem template. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why didn’t the issue get caught by unit tests?</li>
  <li>Why didn’t the issue get caught by integration/smoke tests?</li>
  <li>Why didn’t the issue get flagged in Code Review?</li>
  <li>Why didn’t the issue get caught during manual QA?</li>
  <li>If the outage took over an hour to get discovered, why didn’t the monitoring page our on-call?</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="b-defining-root-cause">B. Defining “Root Cause”</h5>
<p>“5 Whys” recommends continuing to ask why until you’re about five levels deep. We were often stopping at one or two.</p>

<p>To make stopping less ambiguous, here are a set of “root causes” that I think are close to exhaustive:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>trade-off</strong> we were aware of this concern but explicitly made the speed-vs-quality trade-off (IE, not adding tests for an experiment). This was tech debt coming back to bite us.</li>
  <li><strong>knowledge gap</strong> the person doing the work was not aware that this kind of error was even possible (IE, tricky race conditions, worker starvation)</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>brain fart</strong> now that we look at it, we should have caught this earlier. “Just didn’t get enough sleep that night” kind of thing.</p>

    <p>If you keep asking “why” but haven’t gotten to an answer that boils down to one of these, keep going deeper (or get a second opinion).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
