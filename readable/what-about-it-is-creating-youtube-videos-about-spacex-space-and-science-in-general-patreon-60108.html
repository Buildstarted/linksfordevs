<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div data-tag="summary-container"><p>Welcome to the Patreon page of <strong>What about it!?<p>Thank you for coming here! </p></strong><br><strong>Who am I?</strong><br><strong></strong><br>My name is Felix Schlang, and I am what you could call a self taught space enthusiast! Years and years of reading books and watching videos (not unlike the ones I make) have accumulated a big chunk of knowledge about all sorts of topics. So I am inviting you to dive all the way in with me. To explore Space and Rockets and to conquer the unknown! <strong>What about it!?</strong> is the essence of the space nerds needs for knowledge!<br><strong></strong><br><strong>Why should you support What about it!?</strong></p><p>By supporting What about it!? you help me to continue the show<strong> in an improved way! </strong>Every Episode takes between <strong>20 and 50 hours</strong> of work. There are two Episodes each week, so funding is essential for the continuation of the whole project. I have<strong> time and ideas</strong>. You can help me with the third factor: <strong>funding!</strong></p><p><strong>What will I do with the money?</strong></p><p>Funding is essential for many aspects of the channel! Funding enables me to do excursions and trips to research the <strong>stories you want to see! </strong>It enables me to step up the game with better equipment and go the whole nine yards of journalism for you and everyone else, watching <strong>What about it!?</strong></p><p>There are many different aspects of creating a well researched and quality Youtube Channel about Space. The more funding there is, the more quality I am able to put into each and every episode.</p><p><strong>Thank you for considering a donation to What about!? Every Patron counts towards the goal of improving the channel and thus the content you can expect!<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH!</p></strong></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
