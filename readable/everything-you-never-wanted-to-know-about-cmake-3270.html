spine. I‚Äôve been deep in the muck of its behavior and tooling the last few
weeks as I finish up a CMake library titled <a href="https://github.com/ixm-one/ixm">IXM</a>. While the various
minutiae of how IXM works, why I wrote it, and all the nice little usage
details are definitely for another post, the quick summary is that it abstracts
away a majority of common needs from CMake users, thus allowing you to write
<em>even less</em> CMake (and I think we can all agree that‚Äôs a good thing). After
writing a small ranty post in the YOSPOS subforum on Something Awful about all
the gross and disgusting things I‚Äôve learned about CMake in recent weeks, I
decided I‚Äôd write up a more in-depth description. Without further ado, let‚Äôs
get into teaching you, the average user, everything you never wanted to know
about CMake.</p><h2 id="quick-introduction">Quick Introduction</h2><p>Rather than explaining what CMake is, what it does, how it works in extreme
detail, or what have you, I‚Äôm going to quickly describe the various steps CMake
takes during the entire build process. Effectively, the workflow of CMake is as
follows:</p><ul><li>configure</li><li>generate</li><li>build</li></ul><p>Within these steps we can do the following:</p><ul><li>configure<ul><li>copy files</li><li>execute processes</li><li>read/write to files</li><li>check host system state</li><li>create, import, and modify build targets</li></ul></li><li>generate<ul><li>write to files</li><li>run generator expressions</li><li>‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs about it</li></ul></li><li>build<ul><li>post-build commands</li><li>pre-build commands</li><li>execute processes</li><li>generate files for consumption in later build stages, but <em>only</em> if CMake
was able to prove that it could consume the files via the DAG.</li></ul></li></ul><p>One of the many criticisms of CMake is that it is not immediately obvious as to
what commands will run at what stage. Some commands execute, and then create
steps to execute at the <code>generate</code> step, others run during the <code>configure</code>
step, and still others will finally execute during the <code>build</code> itself.</p><p>IXM itself is mostly concerned with the configure and generation step. Because
we cannot specify to the user the stage that executes at what time, we try to
hide the <code>generate</code> operations behind <code>configure</code> step command calls. This
means that while we rely on the user performing work in the configure stage,
they have less work to do as we simply setup <em>generator expressions</em> to execute
in the background later. The nice thing about this is that we can figure out
at the generation stage if our DAG is actually safe and correct and not just
‚Äúhope for the best‚Äù during the configure stage.</p><h2 id="cursed-and-custom-variables">Cursed and Custom Variables</h2><p>Variables in CMake are just cursed eldritch terrors, lying in wait to scare the
<em>absolute</em> <strong>piss</strong> out of anyone that isn‚Äôt expecting it. Luckily, I drink a
lot of coffee and I take a dieuretic so this isn‚Äôt anything <em>new</em> for me.</p><p>Beginning with CMake 3.0, there was a change in the way CMake treats variables.
Effectively, an ‚Äúunquoted‚Äù argument can be any character except whitespace or
one of <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>#</code>, <code>\</code>, <code>"</code>, or <code>&gt;</code>. Yes, this means CMake variables can
contain emoji! How‚Äôs <em>that</em> for a modern programming language?</p><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>set</span>(üôÉ <span>"Why would you do this?"</span>)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre><p>But there is a caveat. When dereferencing a variable <em>explicitly</em> (i.e.,
<code>${üôÉ}</code>), one must escape any non-alphanumeric character or the characters <code>_</code>,
<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>.</code>, and <code>/</code>. Except, it‚Äôs not the characters you‚Äôre escaping, but
the <em>bytes themselves</em>! Thus, we can never <em>actually</em> dereference the value
stored in üôÉ, unless CMake does it for us. This is done in the <code>if()</code>,
<code>elseif()</code>, <code>else()</code>, <code>while()</code>, and <code>foreach(IN LISTS)</code> commands.</p><p>Additionally, because <code>function()</code> and <code>macro()</code> can take an <em>unquoted
argument</em>, this means we can <em>also</em> name functions and macros with <em>literally
anything</em>. The hard part, in this case, is how we can call a command. The only
valid characters in this case are alphanumeric and the character <code>_</code>. Why would
CMake let us create functions that can‚Äôt be called? Hell if I know! ü§£</p><p>This brings us to the very last bit of information regarding variables in
CMake. You can, with a little bit of magic, create your own variable
namespaces. So, CMake‚Äôs current set of variables exist in the following
dereference ‚Äúspaces‚Äù. There is <code>$</code>, which is the default lookup rules.
Additionally, there is also <code>$CACHE</code> and <code>$ENV</code>. Both of these look into the
<code>CMakeCache.txt</code> file and system environment variables respectively. This style
of variable dereferencing has spread to other parts of CMake. The most
explicitly obvious module would be <code>ExternalData</code>, which provides special
<code>DATA{}</code> variable references.</p><p>In IXM‚Äôs case, we go a step beyond this, and created a custom syntax to permit
the fetching of content via various ‚Äúprovider‚Äù variable references. In this
syntax, one can specify packages much like other build system/package manager
combos. As an example, to get extremely popular Catch2 C++ library, you can
specify it via <code>HUB{catchorg/catch2@v2.6.0}</code>. This name can then be passed
around, and it will eventually be use to construct parameters to the
<code>FetchContent</code> module. Yes, it‚Äôs painful, terrifying, and I‚Äôm not going to show
you how to do it because it involves abusing CMake‚Äôs regex engine, ad-hoc
string replacements, and an arrogance not seen since moments before Icarus
plummeted to his death.</p><h2 id="basic-dict-ion">Basic Dict-ion</h2><p>CMake‚Äôs current builtin data type is the string. However lurking behind this
string data type is an actual type system. How else, then, would CMake know
what is a library and what is a source file? One major thing it is lacking
however is for a basic key-value system. As it turns out, we can abuse the
current library type system to create our own dictionary type. The way this is
done is to simply create an <code>INTERFACE IMPORTED</code> library. Then we simply add
functions that automatically add <code>INTERFACE_</code> to any keys passed in. Because
the interface target is imported, anything that might <em>depend</em> on this library
masquerading as a dictionary will not require that the target be exported
during the install step. Thus, we <em>can</em> get properties via the
<code>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY&gt;</code> generator expression, however it is up to us to make sure
the <code>INTERFACE_</code> portion is prepended. I would love to see an alternative to
this, but oh well.</p><p>The only downside to this approach is that, due to scoping rules within CMake,
dictionaries are faux-global. In other words, they are available to CMake
scripts from the directory they were created in and any child directories.
They cannot, sadly, be local to function scopes. Perhaps this might change
in the future, and we‚Äôll get a real honest to god dictionary type, but don‚Äôt
hold your breath. I‚Äôd rather see the CMake language go away entirely than get a
dictionary type. üôÇ</p><h2 id="improper-properties">Improper Properties</h2><p>Remember moments ago when we were talking about ‚Äúvalid‚Äù strings and UTF-8?
Well, I lied. As it turns out you just have bytes on your system. This means we
can make <em>invalid</em> UTF-8 character sequences. One value that will never exist
in a valid UTF-8 sequence is the <code>C0</code> byte. Well, as it happens, we can just
dump that into a property.</p><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(ASCII <span>192</span> C0)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>set_property</span>(<span>TARGET</span> <span>${target}</span> PROPERTY INTERFACE_<span>${C0}</span> value)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre><p>Behold! CMake gives us the ability to have invalid properties and it doesn‚Äôt
even come to close giving a <em>shit</em>.</p><p>Coincidentally, the above property name is used to keep track of keys that were
added to a <code>dict()</code> via the IXM interface. This comes into play when we
serialize our dictionary types to disk, as knowing the exact keys to save comes
in handy. This is especially true because we want to serialize them minus their
<code>INTERFACE_</code> prepended strings.</p><p>Additionally, there is a curious approach to handling cache variables in CMake.
Cache variables effectively live in their own scope. This is why we can have
<code>$CACHE{VAR}</code> to skip the typical variable lookup. In addition to setting the
value of a cache variable via <code>set()</code>, we can also set them via <code>set_property</code>.
After all, cache variables have <em>properties</em>, one of which is <code>VALUE</code>. Which we
can get or set as desired. No need to call <code>set(... FORCE)</code> or
<code>-DVAR:TYPE=VALUE</code> the variable.</p><h2 id="serialization-and-custom-file-formats">Serialization and Custom File Formats</h2><p>CMake‚Äôs ‚Äútreat everything as a string‚Äù approach to scripting means that we have
interesting side effects. Specifically, CMake does not (at the time of this
writing) have any way of performing IO on binary data. Instead, you must
either use a pre-existing language or tool to make sure that you can extract
binary data. This is, to be quite frank, frustrating as hell. <em>However</em>, we
can cheat and make our own file formats. If you recall, ASCII (and by extension
Unicode), have what are known as the C0 control codes. While many of these,
such as the <code>SOH</code> (<em>Start Of Header</em>) or <code>STX</code> (<em>Start of Text</em>) control codes
have become superfluous thanks to the existence of TCP/IP, we can still use 4
specific control codes for separating our data into hierarchical structures.
Specifically, the File Separator, Group Separator, Record Separator, and Unit
Separator control codes are easily within our grasp. This means we can have a
fairly extensive amount of data split up.</p><p>CMake treats all strings separated by a <code>;</code> as a list. This means having lists
of lists is difficult. But with the magic of the above separators, we simply
have to perform a <code>string(REPLACE)</code> call. The downside is we have to do it
at least <em>once</em> per level of depth, but that is simple enough. Effectively,
encoding looks like so</p><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(ASCII <span>31</span> unit-separator)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(REPLACE <span>";"</span> <span>"${unit-separator}"</span> data <span>"${data}"</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>list</span>(APPEND output <span>"${data}"</span>)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre><p>Of course the reverse is to simply switch the location of the <code>;</code> and
<code>${unit-separator}</code> when extracting from output.</p><p>The actual <code>dict(SAVE)</code> function in IXM looks like the following</p><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p><span>function</span> (ixm_dict_save name)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>  parse(<span>${ARGN}</span> @ARGS=<span>1</span> INTO)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>if</span> (<span>NOT</span> INTO)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>    error(<span>"dict(SAVE) missing 'INTO' parameter"</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>endif</span>()</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>  ixm_dict_noop(<span>${name}</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>  dict(KEYS <span>${name}</span> keys)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(ASCII <span>29</span> group)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(ASCII <span>30</span> record)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(ASCII <span>31</span> unit)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>foreach</span> (key IN LISTS keys)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>    dict(GET <span>${name}</span> <span>${key}</span> value)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>if</span> (value)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(REPLACE <span>";"</span> <span>"${unit}"</span> value <span>"${value}"</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>list</span>(APPEND output <span>"${key}${record}${value}"</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>endif</span>()</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>endforeach</span>()</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>list</span>(JOIN output <span>"${group}"</span> output)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>  ixm_dict_filepath(INTO <span>"${INTO}"</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(ASCII <span>1</span> SOH)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(ASCII <span>2</span> STX)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(ASCII <span>3</span> ETX)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(ASCII <span>25</span> EM)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(ASCII <span>30</span> RS)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(ASCII <span>31</span> US)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>file</span>(WRITE <span>${INTO}</span> <span>"${SOH}IXM${STX}${RS}version${US}1${ETX}${output}${EM}"</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>endfunction</span>()</p></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre><p>Yes, we are writing various <code>STX</code> and <code>EM</code> values to the file as well (even
thought <em>technically</em> that‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre meant for), however thats to
future proof this file for its versioning, as the actual layout of the file may
change in the future, especially since IXM is <em>currently</em> not even at a stable
alpha version.</p><p>This ‚Äòstreaming‚Äô format from the tape drive days<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> works well for CMake, as
we lack fine grained byte access into strings. We cannot simply jump around
willy nilly. We either must rely on content being stored in a CMake safe
format, regexes, or reading one byte at a time in the CMake language (No thank
you! üôÖ). By treating CMake content as a ‚Äústream‚Äù of data, we can stitch
the entire serialized format back into a state within CMake, as well as write
it back out with little to no issue.</p><p>Currently the IXM ‚Äòdatabase‚Äô format looks something to the effect of the
following:</p><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>‚êÅIXM‚êÇ‚êûversion‚êü1‚êûadditional‚êükey‚êüvalue‚êüpairs‚êÉ‚êú&lt;filename&gt;‚êù&lt;dict-name&gt;‚êûkey‚êüvalue</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>‚êülist‚êûanother‚êükey‚êüpair‚êûOPTIONS‚êüBUILD_TESTING‚êüOFF[‚êú&lt;filename&gt;‚êù&lt;dict-name&gt;...]‚êô</p></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre><p>The above text formatting might be a bit hard to follow, but let‚Äôs walk through
it anyhow. First, we use the <em>start-of-header</em> control code. This is so
multiple <em>database files</em> can be concatenated together without issue, or
possibly even embedded into another text file altogether. This is then followed
by the <em>start-of-text</em> control code. This is used to terminate the
<em>start-of-header</em> control code. We then treat the <em>record separator</em> and <em>unit
separator</em> as a single depth way of setting key-value pairs in the database
header. Currently, we just set the date, but in the future additional metadata
could possibly be stored.</p><p>Next, we store a ‚Äúfile‚Äù. This representation is technically superfluous. As of
right now, we only ever have the one file, unless other files were written to
and are being concatenated. Regardless, it‚Äôs nice to have it be forward
compatible. Each <em>group</em> is separated by the name of the target, followed by
its key-value pairs. These are separated by <em>record</em> and <em>unit</em> respectively. A
<em>unit</em> separator might not appear if the values for a key are a single value.
Keys that have no value are never written to disk. <code>dict()</code> instances with no
keys are never written to disk either.</p><p>So, why do this in the first place? Well, it gives us a bit more flexibility.
Instead of polluting the CMake cache for storing previous runs (and then having
to sometimes delete the cache just to fix some broken state), we can instead
store previous runs for expensive operations. Want to work around the
<code>try_compile</code> way of things and increase <code>check()</code> throughput? While not
yet implemented, this approach of serializing data in the way people are used
to allows us to side step some of CMake‚Äôs anachronisms.</p><h2 id="events-and-the-nightmares-held-within">Events and The Nightmares Held Within</h2><p>Remember above how I said we can‚Äôt call commands that don‚Äôt meet the calling
convention? Sorry, but I lied again! There is only <em>one</em> way this works, and
that‚Äôs by way of events. Yes, <em>CMake has events</em>. No, they are <em>not</em>
documented, and the order of operations is fickle and can change because some
user ‚Äúdid a thing‚Äù you weren‚Äôt expecting. With the exception of <em>one</em>
operation. The hidden and not so well known <em>post-configure</em> step.</p><p>CMake has a very interesting command, typically meant for debugging. It is
called <code>variable_watch</code> and it takes the name of a variable and a command.
Because it is a parameter, this command name can be an unquoted argument. The
same type of unquoted argument that allows us to have emoji or invalid UTF-8
byte sequences in our function names.</p><p>When CMake is finished with its configuration step, the
<code>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR</code> variable is set to an empty string. This means that,
for all intents and purposes, we can execute destructors. Yes. <em>We can force
CMake to have RAII</em>. We can even check the current stack to see where we
are when executing. This makes the following possible:</p><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p><span>function</span> (ixm::exit variable access value current stack)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>endfunction</span>()</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>variable_watch</span>(CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR ixm::exit)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre><p>This is, I should note, <em>extremely useful</em> if you‚Äôre trying to break CMake to
not do its normal thing of crushing your soul everytime you want to start a new
project.</p><h2 id="file-generate">file(GENERATE)</h2><p>Last on our list is the very powerful and <em>very terrifying</em> <code>file(GENERATE)</code>
command. This command allows us to feed generation expressions to CMake that
will then be used to generate a file at the <code>generate</code> step. These are, in
effect, the closest analogy to a <em>post-generate</em> step we can get. What this
allows us to do, essentially, is generate any kind of file that can depend on
content that was created during the configure step. To save your sanity, I‚Äôm
not going to be posting all of the massive amounts of code I‚Äôve written to
get the behaviors discussed below. You‚Äôre more than free to peruse the project
itself if you‚Äôre curious.</p><p>For instance, this is how you can generate a response file for your C or C++
compiler based off of a target.</p><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p><span>function</span> (ixm_generate_response_file <span>target</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>  parse(<span>${ARGN}</span> @ARGS=? LANGUAGE)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>get_property</span>(rsp <span>TARGET</span> <span>${target}</span> PROPERTY RESPONSE_FILE)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>if</span> (<span>NOT</span> rsp)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>set</span>(output <span>"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/IXM/${target}.rsp"</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>set_target_properties</span>(<span>${target}</span></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>    PROPERTIES</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>      RESPONSE_FILE <span>${output}</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>endif</span>()</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>  ixm_generate_response_file_expressions(<span>${target}</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>string</span>(JOIN <span>"\n"</span> content</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>${Default}</span></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>${Release}</span></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>${Debug}</span></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>${INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES}</span></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>${COMPILE_DEFINITIONS}</span></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>${COMPILE_OPTIONS}</span></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>${COMPILE_FLAGS}</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>file</span>(GENERATE</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>    OUTPUT $&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:<span>${target}</span>,RESPONSE_FILE&gt;</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>    CONTENT <span>${content}</span>)</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p><span>endfunction</span>()</p></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre><p>Essentially, this gives you a way to get all the flags given to a specific
target without having to manually track all the possible flags. Sadly, we
cannot get the property granularity on a <em>directory</em> or <em>source file</em> level
scope. Regardless, generating a response file means we can do things, like,
generate a precompiled header in a cross platform way. No need for
<a href="https://github.com/sakra/cotire">cotire</a>‚Äôs approach to PCH generation, nor do we have to add a custom
language as seen in the <a href="https://github.com/nanoant/CMakePCHCompiler">CMakePCHCompiler</a>. Even better, we can use
<code>file(GENERATE)</code> to <em>conditionally</em> create <em>unity builds</em> on a per-target
basis. If we create our library target with <code>add_library(&lt;name&gt; OBJECT)</code>, then
we‚Äôve recreated the ability to do per-directory unity builds as found in game
engines like Unreal. Combine this with <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">ninja</a> and your build will see a
considerable speed up.</p><p>Finally, a few things we can do with <code>file(GENERATE)</code> also include, but are
not limited to:</p><ul><li>Generating files for services like AppImage, systemd, or launchd without
requiring a user to leave CMake, or using <code>configure_file</code>. Want to
generate a file to automatically turn your executable into a Windows service
as well? You can do that too.</li><li>Write a <code>CPackConfig.cmake</code> file that is created at generation time,
removing the need to <code>include(CPack)</code> after all your calls to <code>install()</code>,
and setting various global variables.</li><li>Generate a <code>CTestConfig.cmake</code> file, or ignore that altogether so you can
have a decent unit test runner for once.</li></ul><h2 id="welcome-to-h-ck">Welcome To H*ck</h2><p>Now that I‚Äôve shared the dark terrifying secrets that lie within CMake, I hope
you, the reader, can internalize the nightmares that are sitting quietly
