A San Francisco County court confirmed Wednesday the panel’s decision.</p><p>Ron settled last month with Google for $9.7 million. However, Levandowski, had disputed the ruling. The San Francisco County Superior Court <a href="https://webapps.sftc.org/ci/CaseInfo.dll?CaseNum=CPF20516984&amp;SessionID=CD2FFDB164554AF3865C517C4865420E75D951B4">denied his petition</a> today, granting Google’s petition to hold Levandowski to the arbitration agreement under which he was liable.</p><p>Levandowski himself may not have to pay the money personally, as this sort of liability may fall to his employer depending on his contract or other legal quirks. However, Levandowski personally filed today for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, stating that the presumptive $179M debt quite exceeds his assets, which he estimates at somewhere between $50M and $100M.</p><p>A representative for Levandowski declined comment for this story.</p><p><em>Devin Coldewey contributed to this story.</em></p></div></div></div>
