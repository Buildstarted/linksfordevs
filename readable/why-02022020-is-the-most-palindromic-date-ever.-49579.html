            Hey you! Yes, you in the 62.5%. Subscribe to my channel!

This was a quick video I made in a hotel room. I couldn't let 02/02/2020 pass without marking the occasion with a video!

Here are the years which are palindromic dates as well as being palindromic splits in the year for the USA and UK style calendars.

22/01/1022 UK
01/02/2010 USA
02/02/2020 UK
02/02/2020 USA
09/12/2190 UK
01/22/2210 USA
12/09/9021 USA
12/29/9221 USA

These are the dates on my sheets:

USA
08/31/1380
10/02/2001
- 36 years in the 2000s have a palindromic date
09/22/2290
10/03/3001

UK
29/11/1192
10/02/2001
- 60 years in the 2000s have a palindromic date
29/12/2192
10/03/3001

Sorry, Think Maths have not made any teacher resources for this video, but check out their resources for all my other videos here: http://think-maths.co.uk/standupmaths-videos

CORRECTIONS
- I messed up the next palindrome date which works for UK and USA style calendars. We've already had November and OCTOBER (not December which I said) and the next one is December: 12/12/2121. First pointed out by Dr Amy.
- Typos in description spotted by R Dollarandyou.
- Let me know if you spot any mistakes! Other than the exposure not matching.
