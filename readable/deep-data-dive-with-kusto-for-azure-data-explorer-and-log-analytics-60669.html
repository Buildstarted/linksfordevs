<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Azure provides some incredible services for storing and analyzing data. One service I use every day is <a href="https://jlik.me/hpa">Azure Monitor</a>. It automatically gathers information from my <a href="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/series/serverless-link-shortener/">serverless link shortener</a> app and surfaces analytics and insights through <a href="https://jlik.me/hpb">Application Insights</a>.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/kusto-azure-data-explorer-log-analytics/images/appinsights.png" alt="Application Insights"></p><p>My logs are automatically captured through <a href="https://jlik.me/hpc">Log Analytics</a> and I can investigate the data using <a href="https://jlik.me/hpd">Azure Data Explorer</a>. The service for storing and handling interactive analytics is called <a href="https://jlik.me/hpe">Kusto</a>, and it has a unique query syntax that is similar to SQL. There is plenty of in-depth documentation about Kusto. I struggled with it until I started my <a href="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/new-role-dotnet-data-pm/">new role as .NET Data PM</a> and began looking into telemetry about how .NET users manage data in their applications. I had some <em>ah-hah</em> moments I want to share.</p><h2 id="finding-kusto">Finding Kusto</h2><p>Enhancing serverless functions with Application Insights is as simple as checking a box when you create the host. This generates a ton of metrics without touching your code. You can extend what’s out of the box with extra functionality. I customized my code to raise an event that lists the <em>medium</em> of a click event. For example, if I shared the link on Twitter, a “twitter” event is emitted. The code looks like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>public</span> <span>static</span> TelemetryClient telemetry = <span>new</span> TelemetryClient()
{
<span>#if !DEBUG
</span><span></span>    InstrumentationKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(<span>"APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY"</span>)
<span>#endif
</span><span></span>};
<span>// other code
</span><span></span>telemetry.TrackEvent(medium);
<span>// other code
</span></code></pre></div><p>Simple enough, right? Now let’s find the results. First, I navigate to my Application Insights instance in the portal. I scroll down to <code>Monitoring</code> and choose <code>Logs</code>.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/kusto-azure-data-explorer-log-analytics/images/appinsightlogs.png" alt="Navigate to logs from Application Insights"></p><p>This takes me to the data explorer. I get a handy list of data sources that I can work with and a text box to enter my query. I’ve highlighted two data sources that are interesting to me.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/kusto-azure-data-explorer-log-analytics/images/datasources.png" alt="Data Sources"></p><h2 id="kusto-basics">Kusto basics</h2><p>The real <em>ah-hah</em> moment that came to me was how Kusto works. If you think of it as a pipeline, you’ll do just fine. Let’s examine the <code>customEvents</code> data source first. Just stating the data source name injects it into the pipeline and returns its rows. <em>Don’t run the query yet!</em></p><p><code>customEvents</code></p><p>Notice you get full autocompletion in the browser. This works for tables as well as properties.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/kusto-azure-data-explorer-log-analytics/images/autocompletion.png" alt="Autocompletion"></p><p>First, we want to make sure we don’t load too much data. Five rows should be enough to shape the data. So, I insert a command to limit the rows into the pipeline:</p><pre><code data-lang="kusto">customEvents
| take 5
</code></pre><p>This gives me 5 rows:</p><p><img src="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/kusto-azure-data-explorer-log-analytics/images/customEvents.png" alt="Custom Events"></p><p>Let’s do the same thing with <code>pageViews</code>.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/kusto-azure-data-explorer-log-analytics/images/pageViews.png" alt="Page Views"></p><p>Great! Now we can start to do something more interesting.</p><h2 id="summarize-data">Summarize data</h2><p>Here’s my goal:</p><blockquote><p>Show me the top five most clicked pages in the past 24 hours and break them down by medium.</p></blockquote><p>First, we’ll need to filter for the past day and summarize by page (the URL is stored in the <code>name</code> property.)</p><pre><code data-lang="kusto">pageViews
| where timestamp &gt;= ago(24h)
| summarize totalclicks=count() by name
</code></pre><p>Here’s the result. Notice there are 50 records in total.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/kusto-azure-data-explorer-log-analytics/images/summary.png" alt="Summary"></p><p>Next, we want to order by clicks and take the top five. Here’s where Kusto diverges from SQL in how you compose queries: with SQL, you need to think in terms of sets and possibly use table expressions or resort to temporary tables. In Kusto, we are just walking through a pipeline. So, we add on the order and summary like this:</p><pre><code data-lang="kusto">pageViews
| where timestamp &gt;= ago(24h)
| summarize totalclicks=count() by name
| order by totalclicks desc
| take 5
</code></pre><p>The result is my most clicked pages in the past 24 hours.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/kusto-azure-data-explorer-log-analytics/images/toppageviews.png" alt="Top Page Views"></p><h2 id="alias-your-views">Alias your “views”</h2><p>I want to use the top five pages later in my pipeline, but instead of trying to join to the full query, I can simply alias it and reference it like a view later in the pipeline. This is how to alias the query:</p><pre><code data-lang="kusto">let top5pages=pageViews
| where timestamp &gt;= ago(24h)
| summarize totalclicks=count() by name
| order by totalclicks desc
| take 5;
</code></pre><p>This won’t run by itself because Kusto expects every query to end with tabular data. We’ve aliased a query but aren’t using it yet. To make it “runnable” we simply express the view in the pipeline:</p><pre><code data-lang="kusto">let top5pages=pageViews
| where timestamp &gt;= ago(24h)
| summarize totalclicks=count() by name
| order by totalclicks desc
| take 5;
top5pages;
</code></pre><blockquote><p><i></i><strong>Tip</strong>: it is easy to think of the query as having multiple steps. However, everything is considered a single batch of work and Kusto will examine the entire set of statements to optimize and produce your results.</p></blockquote><h2 id="shape-the-data">Shape the data</h2><p>Now I want to look at custom events. The first issue I have is that the event property <code>name</code> is the same as the page property <code>name</code>. Therefore, I want to change the name of the property to <code>type</code>. There are a lot of properties in the <code>customEvents</code> data source. I’m only interested in two: the <code>type</code> or <em>medium</em>, and the <code>operation_Id</code>. This is a unique identifier I can use to join back to the <code>pageViews</code> data source.</p><p>The <code>extend</code> statement allows me to inject new columns. I can assign a literal or use it to move the value from one property into another as I do here. To shift <code>name</code> into <code>type</code> I simply add:</p><pre><code data-lang="kusto">| extend type=name
</code></pre><p>The <code>project</code> statement allows me to specify what properties I want, like <code>select</code> in SQL. Here’s the full query:</p><pre><code data-lang="kusto">customEvents
| where timestamp &gt;= ago(24h)
| extend type=name
| project type, operation_Id;
</code></pre><p>The result is a list of type and operation identifiers.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/kusto-azure-data-explorer-log-analytics/images/customprojection.png" alt="Custom Projection"></p><p>I aliased the last view to <code>custom</code>. I realized I have two filters that look back 24 hours. It makes sense to ensure they are consistent, so I created an alias for that expression too. This is where I’m at (this query isn’t runnable because it doesn’t return any data yet).</p><pre><code data-lang="kusto">let cutoff = ago(24h);
let top5pages = pageViews
| where timestamp &gt;= cutoff
| summarize totalclicks=count() by name
| order by totalclicks desc
| take 5;
let custom = customEvents
| where timestamp &gt;= cutoff
| extend type=name
| project type, operation_Id;
</code></pre><p>Now let’s get to some results!</p><h2 id="join-for-the-result">Join for the result</h2><p>I want to include exact matches for custom events, so my first join will need to be an <em>inner join</em>. I only want to include the top five pages, so I’ll also do an inner join to that table. Finally, I want to order by the page with the most clicks first. Here is the last query in the pipeline. Notice how I join to the aliases I created the same way I would join to an ordinary table or data source.</p><pre><code data-lang="kusto">pageViews
| join kind=inner custom on operation_Id
| join kind=inner top5pages on name
| summarize clicks=count(), total=max(totalclicks) by name, type
| extend page=name
| project page, type, clicks, total
| order by total desc, page asc, clicks desc;
</code></pre><p>Notice the join syntax (if my property was named something different, like <code>id</code>, the syntax would be <code>custom on $left.id == $right.operation_Id</code>). I’m creating two scalar columns: one with clicks within the medium, and another with the total clicks for the page. Finally, I’m shaping and ordering the data.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/kusto-azure-data-explorer-log-analytics/images/topclicks.png" alt="Top Clicks"></p><p>The aliases helped me craft the query, and make it easier to read and more maintainable. This is the exact same query that produces the same results without using aliases:</p><pre><code data-lang="kusto">pageViews
| join kind=inner
(
    customEvents
    | where timestamp &gt;= ago(24h)
    | extend type=name
    | project type, operation_Id
)
on operation_Id
| join kind=inner
(
    pageViews
    | where timestamp &gt;= ago(24h)
    | summarize totalclicks=count() by name
    | order by totalclicks desc
    | take 5
)
on name
| summarize clicks=count(), total=max(totalclicks) by name, type
| extend page=name
| project page, type, clicks, total
| order by total desc, page asc, clicks desc;
</code></pre><p>The “expanded” approach isn’t quite as easy to maintain. Aliases also become more useful when you need to join to the same query multiple times. Query code reuse for the win!</p><h2 id="visualize-the-data">Visualize the data</h2><p>This is the shortest section of the post, because to visualize the data I simply click on the <code>Chart</code> option. It immediately renders the chart that makes the most sense based on the data, while allowing you to tweak the type and content as needed. Here, without me doing a thing, Kusto was smart enough to determine I wanted to group my data by page and view the relative impact of <em>medium</em> or <code>type</code> on clicks.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/kusto-azure-data-explorer-log-analytics/images/topchart.png" alt="Top Chart"></p><p>It is immediately evident that <i></i>Twitter is the clear leader for engagement, followed by <i></i>LinkedIn at a distant 2nd place. Now that I have a working query, I can save it and within milliseconds see a real-time view of the top five clicked pages in the past 24 hours.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>There is a lot more you can do with Kusto. I hope this helps you craft your own queries by moving out of the SQL set-based mindset and into the pipeline processing mindset. I also hope the way I shared the steps in the process serves as a guide to break down what may seem intimidating and/or complex problems up front into tangible “pieces” that compose the final solution. For me, the final step was to pull the Kusto output into Power BI for an up-to-date, interactive dashboard I can use to view my data “at a glance.”</p><p>Do you have any Kusto stories or tips to share?
