But he also gets at the undergirding feeling behind all these actions…a convincing argument that we're all caught up in simulations of political change rather than actually affecting it.” —Andrew Limbong,<em> NPR</em></p><p> “Any page of <em>It Came From Something Awful</em> would be the most shocking page of most books.

It's a blow-by-blow study of the devolution of American culture, especially during the past few years: the rise of the radical "proud boys"; the use of the word "cuck" to insult liberals; the proliferation of offensive memes; the seemingly endless racist, inflammatory rhetoric; and the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was hit by a car driven by a white supremacist in Charlottesville in 2017—an event that prompted Donald Trump to say there were good people on both sides." —<em>Kirkus</em></p><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;"> - </p><a class="contract" aria-describedby="reviewsList">Less…</a></div></div></div></div>
