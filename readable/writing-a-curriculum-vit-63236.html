<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I have been giving a lot of feedback about how to write a better
curriculum vitæ&nbsp;(CV) recently. This post is a way of structuring
and disseminating my thoughts on this matter. As a start, let me briefly
delineate what this post is <em>not</em> about: I am not discussing how to
write a <em>resume</em>. A resume is typically only a single page long and
should provide all information pertinent to a very specific job. A CV,
by contrast, can be any length and usually contains <em>all</em> details
pertinent to your professional life.</p>

<p>Having a CV handy is useful in a variety of situations. Even if you are
not actively looking for a job, recruiters might find your CV and use
it to contact you about an opportunity—and who of us does not like it
when opportunity comes a-knocking? Moreover, since <em>you</em> control what
you put in the CV, you can associate yourself with certain key words for
your research, your special skills, and so on. Last, it provides
a single point of entry to collect your professional activities. There
is no other document or platform that provides you the same opportunity
to describe <em>your</em> work on <em>your</em> terms.</p>

<p>The basic structure of a good CV is always the same. Make sure that the
first page contains the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your name and some points of contact. These could include your office
address, an e-mail address, any social media handles you <em>want</em>
a potential employer to see<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and links to services such as <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>. This section is relevant
because it will tie all the account handles to <em>you</em> as a person, but
also give <em>me</em>—the reader of your CV—an opportunity to check
whether I got the right person. Plus, it is an excellent way to
enable recruiters to find more proofs of your work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most relevant details concerning your education or your most
recent professional experience&nbsp;(in reverse chronological order,
i.e. the most recent piece of information should be shown
first). Some examples: if you are doing your master’s thesis, write
that first, provide a tentative title, and your adviser. If you just
started your Ph.D., write something about your topic, your school,
etc. All of these details tell readers at which point you are in your
career—and this might decide how the CV is being received, what
kind of offers you might be getting, and so on.</p>
<p>This section is also useful when you are applying for a job or
a fellowship, as it gives readers details about your field of
specialisation, and it also provides important information for
potential contacts. Some of my friends, who did not go down the
academic route, even mention that their thesis topic came up in
a job interview—this is the interviewer basically handing you
a freebie by picking a topic you know a lot about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A brief description of your research interests, or specialisation, or
personality. Admittedly, this is not crucial, but it helps to add
a few lines here. Be brief, as in <em>My research deals with
representation learning and the incorporation of domain-specific
knowledge</em>, or <em>I am a back-end software developer with a focus on
cryptographic protocols</em>, or <em>I am a lawyer focussing on
international affairs</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. You do not have to add all kinds of
details here; a reader should just get the general gist of what
kind of career you are having or planning to have.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the first page only. Now, my advice becomes more tailored
towards academic careers. Having mentioned who you are and how to
contact you, you now have to add the daily bread of your research. The
most important items are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Grants</strong> or independent funding that you secured. This is mostly relevant
when you are approaching the end of one chapter of your career, such
as the transition from master’s student to Ph.D. student, or the
transition from Ph.D. to postdoctoral researcher. It is rare
to have any entries in such a section early on, but as you mature, it
becomes increasingly important to demonstrate that you can develop
your own ideas <em>and</em> get the funding to work on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publications</strong>! Again, add them in reverse chronological order so that
one can immediately see the most recent ones. Depending on where you
are in your career, you might want to further partition them
according to the relevance of a venue. For example, you might want to
put highly-competitive journal or conference publications first,
followed by an individual section for workshop papers, which in turn
might be followed by a preprint section. Notice that I am not saying
that preprints are inherently worth <em>less</em> than accepted
publications; you should just make it clear to your readers whether
a given item was peer-reviewed or not. If you do not have a lot of
publications, do not despair, and just list <em>all</em> of them in the same
section!</p>
<p>Some general tips about this part:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure that each item is formatted correctly and gives proper
credit to things like joint authorship, joint supervision etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide sufficient details for readers to <em>find</em> or <em>identify</em> the publication.
Use the proper title, the proper venue, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are one of multiple authors, highlight your own name. While
typically frowned upon in professional typography, <strong>bold</strong> has
become the standard way of doing this. As you advance in your career,
you do not necessarily need this any more, as people will trust your
publication prowess more, but in the beginning, it is really
important. The same goes for highlighting any supervision you did for
a paper. I <u>underline</u> the students I have been supervising.
Again, as you mature in your career, this may not be necessary any
more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refrain from providing information about the acceptance rate of
a conference. Readers should either be familiar with this type of
information&nbsp;(for example, when you are applying for a new
position) or they do not care. I think mentioning these numbers is
the wrong thing to do; in the worst case, it might make you look like
a ‘bean-counter’ that is confused about the true purpose of doing
science, i.e. disseminating knowledge and attacking the
boundaries of human ignorance. Same goes for counting your
publications. I do not see the appeal of stating that you have <span id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><msub><mi>n</mi><mi>c</mi></msub></math>" role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>n</mi><mi>c</mi></msub></math></span></span>
conference papers, <span id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><msub><mi>n</mi><mi>w</mi></msub></math>" role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>n</mi><mi>w</mi></msub></math></span></span> workshop papers, etc. Zachary Lipton
formulated this nicely in a <a href="https://twitter.com/zacharylipton/status/1167859710168485889">witty tweet</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, <em>do</em> put additional information about the grant acceptance
rates or special mentions about your paper in the list. For
example, if your paper receives a coveted spotlight presentation
in a conference, mention it! There is a time and place for modesty,
but you should not make your life a lot harder than it has to be.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Talks</strong>. Again, feel free to further separate them into <em>Invited
Talks</em>—where someone specifically invited <em>you</em> to speak to
them—and <em>Conference Talks</em> etc. if you have a sufficient number of
them. For each talk, mention the title and the venue or location.
This is particularly useful when you give a similar talk multiple
times in <em>different</em> labs, as it demonstrates that your research is
well-received by the community.</p>
<p>Such talks can also be useful to discuss in a job interview; I myself
have been asked about some of my earlier talks, in particular the
ones that have been prepared for a non-academic audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Teaching and supervision</strong>. Provide some details about your
teaching activities. For example, did you support a professor in
their lectures by organising exercises? Did you maybe even give a few
lectures on your own? Be specific here and add <em>everything</em> that
demonstrates that you are capable of standing<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> in front of students
and talking to them about something.</p>
<p>As for the supervision part: if you ever supervised or helped
supervise a thesis, list it here. In this case, you were <em>advising</em>
another person; even if that form of supervision might not be
officially recognised by your home institution, it should be
mentioned in your CV if it happened—remember, you are not claiming
to have been the one who signs off on the thesis, but you <em>are</em>
claiming that you are capable of supporting students in finishing
a project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service to the community</strong>. If you have been reviewing things for
journals or conferences, list them. The same goes for organising
a workshop, assisting in running a conference, and so on. Anything
that is useful to other researchers belongs in this category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Special skills</strong>. Here you can showcase your ability to, say, operate
mass spectrometry machines, or write code in <code>Python</code> using certain
machine learning frameworks etc. Make this section as <em>strong</em> and
<em>specific</em> as possible. For example, when mentioning your knowledge
of a specific programming language, provide some links or some
details. Do <em>not</em> list all programming languages you have ever heard
of without at least briefly qualifying what your knowledge is here.
Are you a beginner user in JavaScript? Or do you already have decades
of experience under your belt?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Miscellanea and references</strong>. Everything else that does not fit
easily into the pre-defined categories could be listed here. If you
have a blog—such as yours truly—you might want to mention it, for
example. Some people also mention hobbies; I have no special
preference here and leave them out most of the time.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, add the contact details of some
references. Whom could I contact if I wanted to learn more about you?
This is particularly relevant if you are just starting out in your
career. You can get people to be your referees if you just ask
them—no specific reason is required, and most people I know are
happy to support their former students and employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modification date</strong>. Close your CV by mentioning when it was last
updated. This makes it easier to see whether we are looking at
something that is recent or something that is more than four years
old. Some people also include the modification date in the header. If
you are using LaTeX—and you <em>should</em>, but that is a different
story—just use the <code>	oday</code> command here.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>How you format the CV is really not all that important. While I like
minimalist styles, the CV should express <em>your</em> personal preferences. If
you want to throw a lot of colour at readers, go forth and have fun!
Same goes fro using a pre-made template. The important this is to fill
the CV with quality content. You can always update and improve it, but
having a CV that is done with the default settings of the <a href="https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv"><code>moderncv</code></a>
package is better than not having a CV at all!</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Should I include a photo or not?</em> It depends on your geographical
location. In Europe, pictures are increasingly frowned upon, and, in
some cases, asking for one in the CV might even be illegal. Since I,
and probably anyone else, has a lot of pictures on their accounts, I
figure that it does not really matter—if someone wants to see your
inherent beauty, they can do so themselves. I would rather use my CV
space to list my achievements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Should I include volunteer work?</em> Sure, why not! Bear in mind that
some employers might look less charitably on some organisations than
on others. However, in the spirit of this very apt <a href="https://xkcd.com/137">xkcd comic</a>, I would rather include them than
exclude them. Not getting interviewed because your prospective employer dislikes the
causes you yourself find important is probably a boon in disguise.
Would you really be happy with working for such an employer anyway?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Should I include links?</em> Yes, please do! As many as you can. If
I can find your great paper easily, that’s superb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Should I include software projects?</em> Yes, of course. Anything that
is useful. Even if you think your code is not good enough, trust me:
no one<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> is going to negatively comment on your code. Instead, the
standard reaction is ‘Thanks for sharing that’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Should I include my grades?</em> Yes, if they are good or required for
a certain position. If you always graduated top of your class etc.,
please <em>do</em> include them! If your grades are mediocre, for whatever
reason, and they are not specifically required, I would leave them
out, probably.</p>
<p>By the way: if you are worried about your grades and what they mean for your
future, maybe <a href="https://3dpancakes.typepad.com/ernie/2005/03/re_phd_with_low.html">this post</a>

will be helpful.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that these tips were useful and wish you good luck in your
careers, wherever they may take you. Until next time!</p>

<p>The discussion of whether it is useful to have any account
associated with your proper name has been raging for multiple years
now. I am firmly in the ‘Take control’ camp, by which I mean that <em>if</em>
I create any account with my proper name, I assume that the general
public is capable of reading it and associating it to me as a person.
This is in particular relevant for services such as Twitter, where the
private and the public often commingle and interact in unexpected
ways. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
