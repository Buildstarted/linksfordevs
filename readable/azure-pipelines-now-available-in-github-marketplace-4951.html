	<p>Software development gets easier when you have access to the tools you need to do your best work. With simple, cohesive workflows, you can reduce context switching fatigue, streamline authentication processes, and focus on problems that really matter. To help you get to a seamless developer experience, weâ€™re continuing our partnership with Microsoft to bring <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines/">Azure Pipelines</a> into GitHub. This new CI/CD service enables you to continuously build, test, and deploy to any platform, and itâ€™s free for open source repositories.</p>
<h2 id="azure-pipelines-in-marketplace">Azure Pipelines in Marketplace<a href="#azure-pipelines-in-marketplace" aria-label="Azure Pipelines in Marketplace" data-anchorjs-icon="#"></a></h2>
<p>Azure Pipelines is now available in <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/azure-pipelines">GitHub Marketplace</a>. With this new integration, you can easily configure a CI/CD pipeline for any Azure application using your preferred language and framework as part of your GitHub workflow in just a few simple steps.</p>
<h3 id="build-and-deploy-with-ease">Build and deploy with ease<a href="#build-and-deploy-with-ease" aria-label="Build and deploy with ease" data-anchorjs-icon="#"></a></h3>
<p>Automatically trigger your pipeline with changes to your repository when you connect Azure Pipelines with GitHub. Get rich status reports, annotated code, and detailed informationâ€”all within the GitHub interface.</p>

<h3 id="works-with-any-platform">Works with any platform<a href="#works-with-any-platform" aria-label="Works with any platform" data-anchorjs-icon="#"></a></h3>
<p>Build, test, and deploy applications to virtual machines; to cloud providers such as Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform; or to app stores across operating systems, including Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. You can even take advantage of built-in tasks for Kubernetes, serverless, and VM deployments as well as a rich ecosystem of extensions for every language and tool.</p>
<h3 id="free-for-open-source-projects">Free for open source projects<a href="#free-for-open-source-projects" aria-label="Free for open source projects" data-anchorjs-icon="#"></a></h3>
<p>Many open source repositories are already using Azure Pipelines for CI/CD, such as CPython, webpack, Visual Studio Code, TypeScript, Atom, and Electron. Get up and running quickly with unlimited build minutes, and up to 10 free parallel Microsoft-hosted build jobs across Linux, macOS, or Windows.</p>
<p>Weâ€™re constantly working towards building an ecosystem that values openness, provides equal opportunities to partners, and empowers developers with access to the right tools. While this integration offers improvements to the way you build with GitHub and Azure Pipelines, we know everyone has their own approach to CI. View a list of our CI partners in <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/category/continuous-integration">GitHub Marketplace</a> to find a solution that works for you.</p>
