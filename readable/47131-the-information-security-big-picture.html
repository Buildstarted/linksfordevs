I am a Microsoft Regional Director MVP and very frequent Pluralsight author from my home here in Australia. We have a security problem, a big one and a lot of this is because we just don't get many of the fundamental principles that are essential to working with modern day connected systems. For example, we assume that just because our organization has a corporate firewall, that everything behind it is safe, but it's not and in fact very frequently there are already attackers inside the network, but this course isn't just about networks and firewalls, it's about all sort of aspects of security we frequently just don't get right. We make incorrect trust assumptions about which sites are safe and which ones are dangerous. We believe that antivirus will protect us from malware, when it simply can't keep up. Even the security principles we've believed for so long are adapting. We are now being told not to force regular password changes. This course dispels many of the myths about information security. It looks at what's happening in the real world, what the evidence tells us about security. It's a big picture course too, so it can be consumed by anyone regardless of their technical depths. I really enjoyed creating this course, especially dispelling some of the myths about security and I really hope you enjoy watching it.</p></div></div></div></div>
