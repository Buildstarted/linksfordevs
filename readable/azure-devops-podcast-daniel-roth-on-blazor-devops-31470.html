He works on building frameworks for web developers, including ASP.NET Core and Blazor. He has previously worked on various parts of .NET, including System.Net, WCF, XAML, and ASP.NET.

They take a look at the future potential of Blazor becoming the next desktop or native programming model, why you should use Blazor, the long-term vision for Blazor beyond what&#x2019;s being released this year, and what the DevOps environment looks like for a Blazor server-side app (from a developer&#x2019;s workstation all the way to running it and supporting it in production).
