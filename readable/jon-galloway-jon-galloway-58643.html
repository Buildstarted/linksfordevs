    <meta property="og:description" content="Between releases of my other book (Professional ASP.NET MVC, next release due out soon!) Jesse Liberty somehow talked me into collaborating with him on writing a book on Windows 8.1 development. Actually, it wasn&#x27;t a hard sell, because I&#x27;ve done a good amount of XAML dev, love C#, and Windows 8 / 8.1 development is a lot of fun. We co-wrote the table of contents, I wrote code samples and very rough drafts (sometimes just bullet points), and Jesse turned it into prose. That worked pretty well, but was a little too slow - especially once my work on Professional ASP.NET MVC 5 ramped up. Fortunately, Phil Japiske agreed to join us and finish the book off. Phil really nailed it - he polished off the remaining chapters, reviewed and greatly improved the existing chapters, and made sure everything was up to date for Windows 8.1."/>
