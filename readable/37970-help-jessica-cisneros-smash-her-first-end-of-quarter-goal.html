Her opponent, Henry Cuellar, received an 'A' rating and over $20,000 from the NRA, he opposes a woman's right to choose, and he's one of the top recipients of donations from Big Oil and the private prison corporation GEO Group.</p><p>Jessica is a human rights lawyer and is fighting for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and a fair and just immigration system. She was recently endorsed by Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p><strong>September 30th is the end of Jessica's first full fundraising quarter, which means weâ€™ll be making our fundraising numbers public with the Federal Election Commission for the first time since we announced.&nbsp;</strong>This will be our chance to show the infrastructure and momentum we are building to win in March.</p><p>We've worked so hard for this. With you on our side, we will end this quarter strong.&nbsp;<strong>Will you join us by pitching in today?</strong></p><p><em>Checks can be mailed to:</em></p><p>7305 San Dario Ave, Ste.
