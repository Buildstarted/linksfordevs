Like others, I’ve been happily using GitHub (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191103013615/https://github.com/catamphetamine" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">@catamphetamine</a>) as the primary way of reaching out to people and publishing the source codes. Until recently.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*3a2vmjVgFA7lOanScWbWlQ.png?q=20" width="2191" height="1733" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="2191" height="1733" role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2191/1*3a2vmjVgFA7lOanScWbWlQ.png"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">A <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:XmmttnE-ZCQJ:https://github.com/catamphetamine" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google-cached</a> version of my GitHub profile, until it was blocked.</figcaption></figure><p id="106b" data-selectable-paragraph="">On March 9th, 2020, GitHub banned my account without any notice for an unknown reason. I found out about that only when people started sending me emails telling me that my hosted libraries have stopped working and asking me why did I delete my GitHub account (I didn’t). Apparently, for any person other than me, when navigating to any of my libraries’ page, GitHub simply displayed a “404 Not found” page. Not even a “user account suspended” page — nothing. Just as if the person didn’t exist, and all their libraries too. GitHub, if you’re banning someone then at least have some balls to publicly admit it.</p><p id="32df" data-selectable-paragraph="">The ban resulted in at least tens of thousands of people using my libraries not being able to access the source codes, not being able to report bugs or seek assistance when they’re stuck. Some of my libraries also relied on “GitHub Pages” for hosting “static” assets (for example, country flag icons), and those have stopped working properly as a result.</p><p id="4e51" data-selectable-paragraph="">The only hint from GitHub was when I navigated to their website and (only for me) it showed a notification at the top saying: <em>“Your account has been flagged. Because of that, your profile is hidden from the public. If you believe this is a mistake, </em><a href="https://support.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>contact support</em></a><em> to have your account status reviewed”</em>. I’ve sent a support request to GitHub, Inc. as soon as I found out about the issue (Ticket ID: 594578). It has been almost a week now and they haven’t responded.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*jDj_JjOiNT-Vbt2C7WzCCA.png?q=20" width="3598" height="426" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="3598" height="426" role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3598/1*jDj_JjOiNT-Vbt2C7WzCCA.png"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">“Flagged”? So this is how you call “disposing of someone” in a “politically correct” manner nowadays — you “flag” them.</figcaption></figure><p id="3bb8" data-selectable-paragraph="">What could possibly be the reason of the ban? Maybe one of my repos contained a mysterious “blacklisted” word? Or was it a hyperlink to some “blacklisted” website somewhere deep in the source codes? Or maybe I’ve called someone a moron on the internet recently? Geez, GitHub. Whatever that could possibly be, it surely doesn’t justify silently blocking off public access to a bunch of useful open-source projects tens of thousands of people rely on in production every day.</p><p id="16f2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Also, apparently, all my comments in all issues in all other repos have instantly disappeared for anyone other than me, and some of those comments contained a lot of really useful and valuable information/knowledge/solutions. While git version control itself makes sure that you don’t lose your code when GitHub, Inc. decides to block you, the same isn’t true for all your other intellectual property in the form of numerous comments you’ve posted in issues/pull-requests/commits/etc (including your employer’s paid repos). It’s funny how GitHub, Inc.’s marketing is all about “sharing” and “co-creating”, and at the same time look how easily they’re stripping the community of all the source codes and knowledge base the people (not them) have collectively created with their time and effort (should I remind you that numerous people have contributed to my repos both in the form of code commits and issue comments) just to maniacally hunt down one guy who just happened to fall out of favor for an unknown reason. Isn’t it what’s called a “loose cannon”? And we’re trusting it with all our sources.</p><p id="1bee" data-selectable-paragraph="">This incident should teach us all that corporations are still corporations, even when proclaimed the heart of open source, even when they’ve played a huge role in growing the open source community to its current state. The main focus of every corporation are good “public relations” image and silky-smooth operation. This giant machine can be your best friend as long as you’re good for the business. But if you accidentally happen to get in its way, it’ll simply screw you over and won’t even notice. If tomorrow a corporate lawyer decides they need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_your_ass" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cover their corporate ass</a> more tightly — be it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">international sanctions</a>, dodging any potential lawsuits from <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=vocal%20minority" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">vocal minorities</a>, or anything else — they won’t think twice: they’ll readily dispose of anyone and betray any “ideals” they used to claim they stand for.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="6e44" data-selectable-paragraph="">The days went by: GitHub, Inc. didn’t reply anything in the ticket. I decided to go take a look at their “Help” website to see if there’re other ways of resolving such issues. Turns out, there’s a dedicated <a href="https://airtable.com/shrGBcceazKIoz6pY" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">“Individual Account Appeal Form”</a> just for cases like this where they ask you a list of privacy-touching mandatory questions, progressively shifting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Overton window</a> until you’re telling them all about your personal life before you even notice:</p><ul><li id="1ecc" data-selectable-paragraph="">“What country do you live in?

Do I also have to go through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_concentration_and_internment_camps" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">concentration and internment camp</a> after submitting this convenient form? No way I’m filling in this insulting oppressive discriminating nonsense. The Internet is free, and it will stay that way. Open Source is free, and you don’t own it. And you don’t own us — the people, who collectively created the very foundation you’re standing on.</p><p id="760c" data-selectable-paragraph="">I guess it’s goodbye then, GitHub. We’ve had a wonderful relationship, but seems like our views have diverged too much, you getting maniacally-obsessively political with every passing year and me trying to not notice that not taking any sides. Looks like you’ve finally forced me to take sides and that’s left me with only one choice. I’m leaving. I’ll start moving everything to <a href="https://gitlab.com/catamphetamine" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GitLab</a>.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="2333" data-selectable-paragraph="">Update: (Attention: Many people will get disappointed, but) A week after I’ve opened the support ticket, GitHub has finally replied. Suspiciously, this happened right after someone popular has posted a link to this article on Hacker News. So, the reason for the abrupt ban of all my public repos turned out to be just a random comment I’ve left on GitHub jokingly calling a guy a prick. Now, don’t get me wrong, I don’t bully other people without a reason. I’m actually a super friendly guy. There used to be a really convenient utility for making Windows switch keyboard layout on Caps Lock (unachievable via standard OS features) called “capslang”. The utility somehow disappeared from my OS, so I set off to re-download it only to find <a href="http://flydom.ru/capslang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this message from the author</a> (translated from Russian):</p><p id="106c" data-selectable-paragraph="">“Attention! Due to a complaint submitted by this person: <a href="https://twitter.com/zbetcheckin" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">zbetcheckin</a> on <a href="https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/browse.php?search=flydom" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">urlhaus.abuse.ch</a> in 2019, the hosting provider has forced me to delete the binaries for the utility I wrote more than 10 years ago and that hasn’t bothered anyone for all these years. You can tell this character everything you think of him to his Twitter account.”</p><p id="1f1d" data-selectable-paragraph="">“Ain’t no problem, bruh!”, — I thought. You know, we developers should stand for each other. Only that I’m more used GitHub so I’ve posted a (now gone) issue rather than a tweet. And I didn’t call the dude nothing serious: I just used a random funny non-latin word that I’ve made up (it doesn’t exist in any of the languages), just to give him a friendly pat on the back, like: “Dude, don’t be a dick”. The guy wouldn’t even understand the nonsense gibberish I’ve called him. Well, turns out he was persistent enough to file yet another takedown complaint. Whatever, I don’t blame him for that, that’s the way he rolls. GitHub though — what surprised me is how swiftly did they react, not even arranging some sort of a hearing, not even notifying me that they’re gonna take down my account, not giving me the right to respond or defend myself. I could even justify a temporary read-only mode, but taking down the entire account along with all the repos, issues and comments, just because someone has filed a complaint? That’s cold.</p><p id="fa4b" data-selectable-paragraph="">But you know what? I’m glad it all happened the way it did. They’ve opened my eyes on many things. I feel like life has taught me a valuable lesson, and I’ve had some new thoughts I have yet to process.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><p id="1d85" data-selectable-paragraph="">Another funny thing is, while I was finishing the update of this post, an email from npm, Inc. hit my inbox. “We are excited to share the news that npm will be joining GitHub!”. Yeah, exciting indeed… What now, npm packages will start getting banned for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3f0uj1/github_project_gets_disabled_for_using_the_word/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">having the word “retard”</a> in them?</p></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section></section></div></div></div>
