      <p>In 2017 I created a set of videos and posts designed to help solopreneurs launch their business. I've gone through this process 4 times now and each time I've learned something new... and relearned something old (aka "the hard way"). You can learn from my mistakes in this playlist! Good luck.</p>

        <img src="https://compsci.pub/content/images/2020/08/cs_basics.jpg" alt=""></a></p><h2>CS Basics</h2>
      <p>This playlist is all about core CS concepts, including theory, binary, data structures and algorithms, information theory and encoding, encryption and more.</p>

      <p>This playlist is focused on helping you get through the grueling interview process at larger tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon and more. Learn the skills and techniques to survive the most grueling interviews in the world. The questions are annoying, but the jobs are worth it.</p>

      <h2>
         <a href="https://compsci.pub/tag/foundations/">Concept and Theory</a>
      </h2>
      <p>I remember the many "ah-HA!" moments I had when researching these videos. Functional programming especially. I would constantly hear terms flying around that I never properly understood - that's what we focus on with these videos.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>
         <a href="https://compsci.pub/tag/data-structures-algorithms/">Data Structures and Algorithms</a>
      </h2>
      <p>This topic is probably where you're going to spend most of your time on this site. Especially if you're interviewing. Understanding your CS data structures and algorithms is absolutely essential!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>
         <a href="https://compsci.pub/tag/interviews/">Interview Prep</a>
      </h2>
      <p>Ah yes, nothing more fun than cramming for a technical interview! With these videos we'll focus on preparation as well as strategy. If you're cramming - be sure to check out the playlist (Coding Interview Bootcamp) in the top menu.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>
         <a href="https://compsci.pub/tag/binary/">Logic and Binary</a>
      </h2>
      <p>Binary is something I've struggled with which sounds silly given that it's about as basic as you can get (a 1 and a 0). It's the stuff that comes later - the arithmetic and bitwise operations that always seem to get me. If you share this problem, these videos are for you.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>
         <a href="https://compsci.pub/tag/software-design/">Software Design</a>
      </h2>
      <p>Understanding design principles is essential - especially if you plan on breaking them. Getting pinned in a code review is never fun, but if you can clearly explain your reasoning then breaking the rules is fun!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>
         <a href="https://compsci.pub/tag/essential-skills/">Unix Skills</a>
      </h2>
      <p>It's a UNIX world out there and as a programmer with skills in the shell, you'll have more power than you ever believed. These videos will hopefully give you a leg up in the UNIX world if you're new to it or, if you aren't, will be a solid refresher for you.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>
         <a href="https://compsci.pub/tag/career/">Your Career</a>
      </h2>
      <p>Might seem a bit odd to have a career topic on a site devoted to Computer Science but then again, understanding the business side of things is critical to our success.</p>
