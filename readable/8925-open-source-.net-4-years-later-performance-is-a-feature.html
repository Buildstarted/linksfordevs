Partly because I really like looking at the <a href="/tags/#Internals">‘Internals’ of CoreCLR</a>, but also because the runtime is the one repository that makes all the others possible, they rely on it!</p><p>To give some context, here’s the slides from a presentation I did called <a href="https://www.updateconference.net/en/session/from--dotnet-run--to--hello-world--">‘From ‘dotnet run’ to ‘hello world’</a>. If you flick through them you’ll see what components make up the CoreCLR code-base and what they do to make your application run.</p><p>So, after a bit of digging through the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr">19,059 commits</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues">5,790 issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/projects">the 8 projects</a>, here’s the list of <strong>significant</strong> changes in the <strong>.NET Core Runtime (CoreCLR)</strong> over the last few years (if I’ve missed any out, please let me know!!):</p><ul><li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Span&lt;T&gt;</code></strong> (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814808.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396">more info</a>)
    </li><li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref-like</code> like types</strong> (to support <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Span&lt;T&gt;</code>)
    </li><li><strong>Tiered Compilation</strong> (<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/02/tiered-compilation-preview-in-net-core-2-1/">more info</a>)
    </li><li><strong>Cross-platform</strong> (Unix, OS X, etc, see list of all <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=os-">‘os-xxx’ labels</a>)
    </li><li><strong>New CPU Architectures</strong></li><li><strong>Hardware Intrinsics</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/projects/7">project</a>)
    </li><li><strong>Default Interface Methods</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/projects/6">project</a>)
    </li><li><strong>Performance Monitoring</strong> and <strong>Diagnostics</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/projects/5">project</a>)
    </li><li><strong>Ready-to-Run Images</strong></li><li><strong>LocalGC</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/projects/3">project</a>)
    </li><li><strong>Unloadability</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/projects/9">project</a>)
    </li></ul><p>So there’s been quite a few large, fundamental changes to the runtime since it’s been open-sourced.</p><hr><h2 id="repository-activity-over-time">Repository activity over time</h2><p>But onto the data, first we are going to look at an overview of the <strong>level of activity in each repo</strong>, by analysing the total number of ‘<strong>Issues</strong>’ (created) or ‘<strong>Pull Requests</strong>’ (closed) per month. (<a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR">Sparklines FTW!!</a>). If you are interested in <em>how</em> I got the data, see the previous post <a href="/2016/11/23/open-source-net-2-years-later#methodology---community-v-microsoft">because the process is the same</a>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Numbers in <span>black</span> are from the most recent month, with the <span>red</span> dot showing the lowest and the <span>green</span> dot the highest previous value. You can toggle between <strong>Issues</strong> and <strong>Pull Requests</strong> by clicking on the buttons, hover over individual sparklines to get a tooltip showing the per/month values and click on the project name to take you to the GitHub page for that repository.</p><section class="press" align="center"><button id="btnIssues" class="active">Issues</button><button id="btnPRs">Pull Requests</button></section><p>This data gives a good indication of how healthy different repos are, are they growing over time, or staying the same. You can also see the different levels of activity each repo has and how they compare to other ones.</p><p>Whilst it’s clear that <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">Visual Studio Code</a> is way ahead of all the other repos (in ‘# of Issues’), it’s interesting to see that some of the .NET-only ones are still pretty large, notably CoreFX (base-class libraries),  Roslyn (compiler) and CoreCLR (runtime).</p><hr><p>Next will will look at the <strong>total participation</strong> from the last 4 years, i.e. <strong>November 2014</strong> to <strong>November 2018</strong>. All <em>Pull Requests</em> and <em>Issues</em> are treated equally, so a large PR counts the same as one that fixes a speling mistake. Whilst this isn’t ideal it’s the simplest way to get an idea of the <strong>Microsoft/Community split</strong>. In addition, <em>Community</em> does include people paid by other companies to work on .NET Projects, for instance <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/search?q=Samsung.com&amp;unscoped_q=Samsung.com&amp;type=Commits">Samsung Engineers</a>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You can hover over the bars to get the actual numbers, rather than percentages.</p><p class="g-chart-issues"><span> Issues: </span><span> Microsoft </span><span> Community </span></p><p class="g-chart-pull-requests"><span> Pull Requests: </span><span> Microsoft </span><span> Community </span></p><hr><p>Finally we can see the <strong>‘per-month’</strong> data from the last 4 years, i.e. <strong>November 2014</strong> to <strong>November 2018</strong>.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can inspect different repos by selecting them from the pull-down list, but be aware that the y-axis on the graphs are re-scaled, so the maximum value will change each time.</p><p id="issuesGraph"><span> Issues: </span><span> Microsoft </span><span> Community </span></p><p id="pullRequestsGraph"><span> Pull Requests: </span><span> Microsoft </span><span> Community </span></p><hr><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>It’s clear that the community continues to be invested in the .NET-related, Open Source repositories, contributing significantly and for a sustained period of time. I think this is good for <em>all .NET developers</em>, whether you contribute to OSS or not, having .NET be a <strong>thriving, Open Source product</strong> has many benefits!</p></div></div></div></div>
