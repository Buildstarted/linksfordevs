<div><p>On June 15th, 2020, my family and I lost the most important person in our lives. My mother was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system. My family and I had very high hopes given that doctors caught it early and it was a form of cancer that was very treatable. My mother started chemotherapy earlier this year and over the past few months, her health had started to decline due to the side effects of the chemo treatments which we were all unaware of until it was too late. She was admitted to the ICU earlier this month due to shortness of breath, excessive coughing, and other symptoms identified by my older brother before she was taken to the hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>We received a diagnosis of pneumonia and several other issues that caused her lungs to start deteriorating including a pulmonary embolism and edema. On the morning of her passing, we learned that a small hole had developed in her lungs. The doctor's tried every treatment that they possibly could from the very first day that she was admitted to the hospital. Unfortunately, the treatments did not improve her condition and on the 15th of June, they told us that there was nothing else that they could do for her. My family and I remained by her side as she took her very last breath.&nbsp;
</p></div>

<p>We are beyond devastated as we try to process the sudden loss of the person most dearest to us. It's hard to even imagine life without my mother, she was my best friend and the one person I knew that I could always lean on. She always protected me and had my back no matter what. I am the woman I am today because of her and her love. She had the most beautiful soul and everywhere she went, she instantly made friends whether at the grocery store, banks, anywhere. People were naturally drawn to her and her beautiful spirit. She was always so full of life and joy. It was rare to ever see her sad. She was so strong even through many hardships and always kept a smile on her face and made us all laugh with her silly jokes and sense of humor. She adopted all of my friends as if they were her own children, making sure they were always fed and comfortable whenever they would stay over.
</p>

<p>She was selfless and her faith in God was so strong. She truly loved The Lord and kept him first in everything that she did. She spent a lot of her life sharing a piece of her beautiful heart with all of those around her. She was always helping others even when she didn't have much to spare. She always found a way to give back in any way that she could and that is something I will continue on in her memory. I strive to be more like her each and every day of my life. She may never to get to see me get married or meet her future grandchildren, but I know that she's watching over me and will forever live in my heart and spirit and I know my family feels the same.
</p>

<p>My family and I are now left to pick up the pieces of our shattered hearts from her unexpected and sudden passing. The cost of her upcoming medical bills and funeral expenses will be a hurdle for us. I have created this gofundme to honor my mother and her memory and to help aid us in providing her with a beautiful burial and ceremony that she most certainly deserves.
</p>

<p>Any amount of donation will certainly help us as we begin preparing for her funeral arrangements.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Thank you so much,
</p>

<p>- From my family and I
</p>
