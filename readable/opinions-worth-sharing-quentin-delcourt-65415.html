<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><date datetime="2020-08-08T00:00:00.000Z">August 8th 2020</date><p>Very often in my career, I was faced with colleagues or managers' decisions that I thought would bring some trouble.</p><p>There is sometimes an opportunity, before the decision starts actually triggering real life effects, where there is still time to raise your voice and share your concerns with your team.</p><p>I am not an extrovert and convincing people has never been my forte, which sometimes prevented me to speak when I should have spoken.</p><p>I once heard about a decision to change a legacy CMS to replace it with a brand new, also custom CMS. On top of bringing absolutely zero new advantage to the end users, I also knew about <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">Spolsky's law</a>, aka you never rewrite a software from scratch.</p><p>I tried to fight it, but struggled to make my point. I gave up pretty quickly and thought that maybe the people leading the decision knew better. Despite my gut feeling. And of course I was very wrong.</p><p>I should have make my voice heard and share my opinions. The decision led us to many performance problems and a system that was not necessarily better than the previous one. And no gain for the end users. Hence, by not raising my voice, I brought myself in a very uncomfortable situation.</p><p>When you think something is not right, don't keep it to yourself, share it with your colleagues. You might thank you later ðŸ™‚</p></div></div></div></div>
