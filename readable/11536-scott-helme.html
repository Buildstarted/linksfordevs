Now we're taking the same concept and extending it to email with MTA-STS, or Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security.  MTA-STSYou can read about MTA-STS…</p></article><article id="5e26a3d6962e030044580a31" class="post tag-legacy-tls tag-tls"><p>With TLS having taken some great steps forwards in recent years, with TLSv1.2 in 2008 and TLSv1.3 in 2018, it's time to start dropping support for the legacy versions of TLS.  Legacy TLSTLSv1.0 was released in 1999, that's more than 20 years ago(!), and TLSv1.1 was…</p></article><article id="5e1d95c59483f80038c028d4" class="post tag-hpkp tag-report-uri"><p>It's been an interesting ride over the last few years but HPKP, or HTTP Public Key Pinning, is finally coming to the end of its tenure. With support now gone in the last remaining browser, HPKP has been consigned to the scrap heap.  HPKPI first wrote about HPKP back in…</p></article><article id="5d9b20fffe8dce00385f7970" class="post tag-tls-2 tag-legacy-tls tag-chrome tag-mixed-content tag-csp"><p>Chrome has certainly been one of the main contributors towards the recent push to HTTPS online and without their contribution, I do find myself wondering how much progress would have been made. The Chrome team have just announced two more big changes coming soon and they will help push the…</p></article><article id="5d7bbde72502d7003855d9cb" class="post tag-crawl tag-https tag-csp tag-hpkp tag-tls tag-security-txt tag-referrer-policy tag-feature-policy tag-caa tag-lets-encrypt"><p>Yes, it's that time of year again and the last 6+ months have flown by. Time for a look at the state of security in the Top 1 Million sites on the web! Here are the results, updates, trends and analysis for the progress we've made over the last 6…</p></article><article id="5d76a572db320b00383e4005" class="post tag-csp tag-nonce tag-report-uri tag-cloudflare tag-cloudflare-workers"><p>Everybody knows I'm a rather large fan of CSP and an even bigger fan of CSP reporting, but CSP can be hard. Part of my personal mission has been to make that easier and a lot of the tools and content I create are focused around that. To that end,…</p></article><article id="5d725850db320b00383e3dcb" class="post tag-ev"><p>Personal like or dislike of EV aside for a moment, we can all agree on what the name of EV certs implies. Organisations get their company details in the certificate and CAs have to do some extended validation of that data compared to a normal certificate. Turns out, that doesn't…</p></article><article id="5d767510db320b00383e3eee" class="post tag-certificate-authorities tag-sc22"><p>We've made some great progress in the TLS and PKI ecosystem in recent years, driven largely by the actions of browser vendors. We could have just taken another step forwards with Ballot SC22 at the CA/B Forum, but too many CAs voted against the ballot.  The CA/B ForumFor…</p></article><article id="5d6ce5cfdb320b00383e3cab" class="post tag-certificate-transparency tag-report-uri"><p>I've spoken a lot about Certificate Transparency on my blog recently and how powerful it is for site operators to be able to keep track of certificates issued for their domains. We plan to make that even easier by integrating CT monitoring into Report URI.  Certificate TransparencyThe TLDR; of Certificate…</p></article><article id="5d723da3db320b00383e3d77" class="post tag-csrf tag-samesite-cookies no-image"><p>A little while back I wrote a blog post about how "CSRF is dead". It focused on SameSite cookies, a powerful yet simple feature to protect your website against CSRF attacks.
