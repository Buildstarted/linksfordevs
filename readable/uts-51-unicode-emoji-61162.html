		<h2>
			1 <a name="Introduction" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a>
		</h2>
		<p>Emoji are pictographs (pictorial symbols) that are typically
			presented in a colorful cartoon form and used inline in text. They
			represent things such as faces, weather, vehicles and buildings, food
			and drink, animals and plants, or icons that represent emotions,
			feelings, or activities.</p>
		<p>
			Emoji on smartphones and in chat and email applications have become
			extremely popular worldwide. As of March 2015, for example, Instagram
			reported that ânearly half of text [on Instagram] contained emoji.â
			Individual emoji also vary greatly in popularity (and even by country),
			as described in the SwiftKey Emoji Report. See
			<a href="https://www.unicode.org//press/emoji.html">emoji press page</a> for details
			about these reports and others.
		</p>
		<p>Emoji are most often used in quick, short social media messages, where
			they connect with the reader and add flavor, color,
			and emotion. Emoji do not have the grammar or vocabulary to
			substitute for written language. In social media, emoji make up for
			the lack of gestures, facial expressions, and intonation that are
			found in speech. They also add useful ambiguity to messages, allowing
			the writer to convey many different possible concepts at the same
			time. Many people are also attracted by the challenge of composing
			messages in emoji, and puzzling out emoji messages.</p>
		<p>
			The word <em>emoji</em> comes from Japanese:
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="http://unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=%E7%B5%B5" target="unihan">çµµ</a> (e â picture) <a href="http://unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=%E6%96%87" target="unihan">æ</a><a href="http://unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=%E5%AD%97" target="unihan">å­</a> (moji â written
			character).
		</p>
		<p>
			Emoji may be represented internally as graphics or they may be
			represented by normal glyphs encoded in fonts like other characters.
			These latter are called <em>emoji characters</em> for clarity. Some
			Unicode characters are normally displayed as emoji; some are normally
			displayed as ordinary text, and some can be displayed both ways.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a name="Media" href="#Media"></a>Thereâs been considerable media
			attention to emoji since they appeared in the Unicode Standard, with
			increased attention starting in late 2013. For example, there were
			some 6,000 articles on the emoji appearing in Unicode 7.0, according
			to Google News. See the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/press/emoji.html">emoji
				press page</a> for many samples of such articles, and also the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/press/emoji.html#keynote">Keynote</a> from the 38th
			Internationalization &amp; Unicode Conference.
		</p>
		<p>Emoji became available in 1999 on Japanese mobile phones. There
			was an early proposal in 2000 to encode DoCoMo emoji in the Unicode
			standard. At that time, it was unclear whether these characters would
			come into widespread useâand there was not support from the Japanese
			mobile phone carriers to add them to Unicodeâso no action was taken.</p>
		<p>The emoji turned out to be quite popular in Japan, but each
			mobile phone carrier developed different (but partially overlapping)
			sets, and each mobile phone vendor used their own text encoding
			extensions, which were incompatible with one another. The vendors
			developed cross-mapping tables to allow limited interchange of emoji
			characters with phones from other vendors, including email.
			Characters from other platforms that could not be displayed were
			represented with ã (U+3013 GETA MARK), but it was all too easy for
			the characters to get corrupted or dropped.</p>
		<p>
			When non-Japanese email and mobile phone vendors started to support
			email exchange with the Japanese carriers, they ran into those
			problems. Moreover, there was no way to represent these characters in
			Unicode, which was the basis for text in all modern programs. In
			2006, Google started work on converting Japanese emoji to Unicode
			private-use codes, leading to the development of internal mapping
			tables for supporting the carrier emoji via Unicode characters in <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2007/11/group-chat-and-rich-emoticons-now.html">2007<img src="http://unicode.org/img/external_link.png" alt="external link"></a>.
		</p>
		<p>There are, however, many problems with a private-use approach,
			and thus a proposal was made to the Unicode Consortium to expand the
			scope of symbols to encompass emoji. This proposal was approved in
			May 2007, leading to the formation of a symbols subcommittee, and in
			August 2007 the technical committee agreed to support the encoding of
			emoji in Unicode based on a set of principles developed by the
			subcommittee. The following are a few of the documents tracking the
			progression of Unicode emoji characters.</p>

		<p>In 2009, the first Unicode characters explicitly intended as
			emoji were added to Unicode 5.2 for interoperability with the ARIB
			(Association of Radio Industries and Businesses) set. A set of 722
			characters was defined as the union of emoji characters used by
			Japanese mobile phone carriers: 114 of these characters were already
			in Unicode 5.2. In 2010, the remaining 608 emoji characters were
			added to Unicode 6.0, along with some other emoji characters. In
			2012, a few more emoji were added to Unicode 6.1, and in 2014 a
			larger number were added to Unicode 7.0. 
			Additional characters have been added since then, based on the
			<em>Selection Factors</em> found in <a href="http://unicode.org/emoji/selection.html">Submitting Emoji
				Character Proposals</a>.
		</p>
		<p>Here is a summary of when some of the major sources of
			pictographs used as emoji were encoded in Unicode. Each source
			may include other characters in addition to emoji, and
			Unicode characters can correspond to multiple sources. The L column
			contains single-letter abbreviations of the various sources
			for use in charts [<a href="#emoji_charts">emoji-charts</a>] and data
			files [<a href="#emoji_data">emoji-data</a>]. Characters that do not
			correspond to any of these sources can be marked with Other (x).

			For a detailed view of when various source sets of emoji were added
			to Unicode, see <b>Emoji Version Sources</b> [<a href="#emoji_charts">emoji-charts</a>]. The data file [<a href="#JSources">JSources</a>]
			 shows the correspondence to the original Japanese carrier symbols.
		</p>
		
	  <p>
			People often ask how many emoji are in the Unicode Standard. This
			question does not have a simple answer, because there is no clear
			line separating which pictographic characters should be displayed
			with a typical emoji style. For a complete picture, see <a href="#Identification"><em>Which Characters are Emoji</em></a>.
	  </p>
		<p>
			The colored images used in this document and associated charts [<a href="#emoji_charts">emoji-charts</a>]
			 are for illustration only. They do not appear in the Unicode
			Standard, which has only black and white images. They are either made
			available by the respective vendors for use in this document, or are
			believed to be available for non-commercial reuse. Inquiries for

			1.1 <a name="Emoticons" href="#Emoticons">Emoticons and Emoji</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			The term <em>emoticon</em> refers to a series of text characters
			(typically punctuation or symbols) that is meant to represent a
			facial expression or gesture (sometimes when viewed sideways), such
			as the following.
		</p>
		<p>;-)</p>
		<p>
			Emoticons <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon">predate Unicode and
				emoji<img src="http://unicode.org/img/external_link.png" alt="external link"></a>,
			but were later adapted to include Unicode characters. The
			following examples use not only ASCII characters, but also U+203F ( â¿
			), U+FE35 ( ï¸µ ), U+25C9 ( â ), and U+0CA0 ( à²  ).
		</p>
		<p>^â¿^</p>
		<p>âï¸µâ</p>
		<p>à² _à² </p>
		<p>
			Often implementations allow emoticons to be used to input emoji. For
			example, the emoticon ;-) can be mapped to <img height="14" width="auto" alt="ð" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_1f609.png"> in a
			chat window. The term <em>emoticon</em> is sometimes used in a
			broader sense, to also include the emoji for facial expressions and
			gestures. That broad sense is used in the Unicode block name <em>Emoticons</em>,
			covering the code points from U+1F600 to U+1F64F.
		</p>
		<h3>
			1.2 <a name="Encoding" href="#Encoding">Encoding Considerations</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Unicode is the foundation for text in all modern software: itâs how
			all mobile phones, desktops, and other computers represent the text
			of every language. People are using Unicode every time they type a
			key on their phone or desktop computer, and every time they look at a
			web page or text in an application. It is very important that the
			standard be stable, and that every character that goes into it be
			scrutinized carefully. This requires a formal process with a long
			development cycle. For example, the <img height="14" width="auto" alt="ð¶" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/ref/ref_1f576.png"> <em>dark
				sunglasses</em> character was first proposed years before it was released
			in Unicode 7.0.
		</p>
		<p>
			Characters considered for encoding must normally be in widespread use
			as elements of text. The emoji and various symbols were added to
			Unicode because of their use as characters for text-messaging in a
			number of Japanese manufacturersâ corporate standards, and other
			places, or in long-standing use in widely distributed fonts such as
			Wingdings and Webdings. In many cases, the characters were added for
			complete round-tripping to and from a source set, <em>not</em>
			because they were inherently of more importance than other
			characters. For example, the <img height="14" width="auto" alt="ð" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/ref/ref_1f581.png" title="U+1F581 ð clamshell mobile phone"> <em>clamshell
				phone</em> character was included because it was in Wingdings and
			Webdings, not because it is more important than, say, a âskunkâ
			character.
		</p>
		<p>
			In some cases, a character was added to complete a set: for example,
			a <img height="14" width="auto" alt="ð" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_1f3c9.png"> <em>rugby football</em>
			character was added to Unicode 6.0 to complement the <img height="14" width="auto" alt="ð" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_1f3c8.png"> <em>american
				football</em> character (the <img height="14" width="auto" alt="â½" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_26bd.png"> <em>soccer ball</em> had
			been added back in Unicode 5.2). Similarly, a mechanism was added
			that could be used to represent all country flags (those
			corresponding to a two-letter <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Language_Locale_Field_Definitions">unicode_region_subtag</a>),
			such as the <em>flag for Canada</em>,
			even though the Japanese carrier set only had 10 country flags.
		</p>
		<p>The data does not include non-pictographs, except for those in
			Unicode that are used to represent characters from emoji sources, for
			compatibility, such as:</p>
		<p>
			<img height="24" width="auto" alt="ð¹" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_1f239.png"> or <img height="24" width="auto" alt="ð" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_1f194.png">
		</p>
		<p>
			Game pieces, such as the dominos (ð° ð± ð² ... ð ð), are currently
			not included as emoji, with the exceptions of U+1F0CF ( <img height="18" width="auto" alt="ð¹" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_1f0cf.png">
			) PLAYING CARD BLACK JOKER and U+1F004&nbsp;(&nbsp;<img height="18" width="auto" alt="ð¹" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_1f004.png">&nbsp;)
			MAHJONG TILE RED DRAGON. These are included because they correspond
			each to an emoji character from one of the carrier sets.

     <p>Character names in all capitals are the formal Unicode Name property values, such as U+1F473 MAN WITH TURBAN. The formal names are immutable internal identifiers, but often do not reflect the current practice for interpretation of the character.</p>
        <p>Lowercase character names for existing existing characters or sequences are CLDR short names, such as U+1F473 <em>person wearing turban</em>.</p>

	  <h4>1.4.8 <a name="Property_Stability" href="#Property_Stability">Property Stability</a></h4>
		<p>The emoji properties are stable for each version of the dataâthey will not change for that version. They may, however, change between that version and a subsequent version. For example, isEmoji(â)=false for Emoji Version 5.0, but true for Version 11.0.</p>
		<p>Some emoji properties are not closed over certain string operations. For example:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>isEmoji(toLowercase(X)) â  isEmoji(X) for the case of X=âï¸, because:</p>
			<blockquote>
		      <p>isEmoji(âï¸) = true<br>
		      toLowercase(âï¸) = â<br>
		      isEmoji(â) = false</p>
	        </blockquote>
	    </blockquote>

		<p>Casing operations may produce invalid variation sequences. While the following strings  form a case pair, the <em><strong>emoji presentation
	    selector</strong></em> is not defined for â, and thus has no effect on its rendering:</p>
		<div>
			<table>
			<tbody><tr><td>âï¸ = &lt;U+24C2 CIRCLED LATIN CAPITAL LETTER M, U+FE0F	VS16&gt;</td>
			  <td>valid variation sequence</td>

	  <!-- consider adding the following text for Unicode 14, but in a different section such as implementation notes:

	  <ul>
		<li><em>All of the emoji sequences start either with an <a href="#def_emoji_character">emoji character</a>
		  or a regional indicator character. </em>This means that parsers can quickly check for possible starting characters
		  for emoji sequences, and only then do deeper analysis.</li>
		<li><em>Two adjacent emoji never &ldquo;merge&rdquo; to form a single emoji,
		  unless the second of the two is an <a href="#def_emoji_modifier">emoji_modifier</a>,
		  or unless both are regional_indicators.</em>
		  This means that only a limited number of characters can &ldquo;extend&rdquo; an emoji sequence.
		  Parsing can stop unless they are encountered.</li>
		<li>Note that while a regional_indicator has the <strong>Emoji</strong> property, it is an
		  <a href="#def_level2_emoji"><strong>emoji component</strong></a>. In isolation, it is thus not

	<h2>
		2 <a name="Design_Guidelines" href="#Design_Guidelines">Design
				Guidelines</a>
	</h2>
		<p>Unicode characters can have many different presentations as
			text. An "a" for example, can look quite different
			depending on the font. Emoji characters can have two main kinds of
			presentation:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>an <em>emoji presentation, </em>with colorful and perhaps
				whimsical shapes, even animated
			</li>
			<li>a <em>text presentation, </em>such as black &amp; white
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			More precisely, a text presentation is a simple foreground shape
			whose color which is determined by other information, such as setting
			a <span>color</span> on the text, while an emoji
			presentation determines the color(s) of the character, and is
			typically multicolored. In other words, when someone changes the text
			color in a word processor, a character with an emoji presentation
			will not change color.
		</p>
		<p>Any Unicode character can be presented with a text
			presentation, as in the Unicode charts. For the emoji presentation,
			both the name and the representative glyph in the Unicode chart
			should be taken into account when designing the appearance of the
			emoji, along with the images used by other vendors. The shape of the
			character can vary significantly. For example, here are just a few of
			the possible images for U+1F36D LOLLIPOP, U+1F36E CUSTARD, U+1F36F
			HONEY POT, and U+1F370 SHORTCAKE:</p>
	  <p>
			<img width="50%" height="auto" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/emoji-examples.png" alt="emoji examples">
		</p>
		<p>
			While the shape of the character can vary significantly, designers
			should maintain the same âcoreâ shape, based on the shapes used
			mostly commonly in industry practice. For example, a U+1F36F HONEY
			POT encodes for a pictorial representation of a pot of honey, not for
			some semantic like "sweet". It would be unexpected to
			represent U+1F36F HONEY POT as a sugar cube, for example. Deviating
			too far from that core shape can cause interoperability problems: see
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tuaw.com/2014/04/30/you-may-be-accidentally-sending-friends-a-hairy-heart-emoji/">accidentally-sending-friends-a-hairy-heart-emoji<img src="http://unicode.org/img/external_link.png" alt="external link"></a>.
			Direction (whether a person or object faces to the right or left, up
			or down) should also be maintained where possible, because a change
			in direction can change the meaning: when sending <img width="auto" height="14" alt="ð" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_1f40a.png"> <img width="auto" height="14" alt="ð«" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_1f52b.png"><img width="auto" height="14" alt="ð®" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/twitter/twitter_1f46e.png"> âcrocodile shot by
			policeâ, people expect any recipient to see the pistol pointing in
			the same direction as when they composed it. Similarly, the U+1F6B6 <em>pedestrian</em>
			should face to the left <img width="auto" height="14" alt="ð¶" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/ref/ref_1f6b6.png">, not to the right.
		See <em>Section 2.10, <a href="#Direction">Emoji Glyph Facing Direction</a></em>.</p>
		<p>
			General-purpose emoji for people and body parts should also not be
			given overly specific images: the general recommendation is to be as
			neutral as possible regarding race, ethnicity, and gender. Thus for
			the character U+1F777 CONSTRUCTION WORKER, the
			recommendation is to use a neutral graphic like 
			<img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/android/android_1f477.png" alt="ð" width="auto" height="14"> 
			(with an orange skin tone) 
			instead of an overly specific image like 
			<img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/android/android_1f477_1f3fb.png" alt="ð" width="auto" height="14"> 
			(with a light skin tone). This includes the 
			<a href="#def_emoji_modifier_base">emoji modifier base</a> characters
			listed in 
			<a href="#Subject_Emoji_Modifiers">Sample Emoji Modifier Bases</a>.
			The emoji modifiers allow for variations in skin tone to
				be expressed.</p>
			<p>Unicode 9.0 adds several characters intended
				to complete gender pairs, and there are ongoing efforts to provide
				more gender choices in the future.
			For more information, see <em>Section 2.3, <a href="#Gender">Gender</a></em>.</p>
			<p>Combining enclosing marks may be applied to emoji, just like they can be
			applied to other characters. When that is done, the combination
			should take on an emoji presentation. For example, a <img height="14" width="auto" alt="1â£" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_0031_20e3.png"> is represented as the sequence "1" plus an emoji presentation
			selector plus U+20E3 COMBINING ENCLOSING KEYCAP.</p>
            <p>The U+20E3 COMBINING ENCLOSING KEYCAP is the only such symbol that is currently in RGI emoji sequences.</p>
            <p> Flag emoji characters are discussed in <a href="#Flags"> Annex B:
			Valid Emoji Flag Sequences</a>.</p>
		<h3>
			2.1 <a name="Names" href="#Names">Names</a>
		</h3>
		<p>Every emoji has a CLDR short name, which may change over time.
			Every emoji character also has a formal Unicode name, like every other Unicode
			character; this is a permanent identifier which cannot be changed.</p>
			
			 
		<p>The formal Unicode name of a Unicode character does not
			determine its appearance. Formal names of symbols such as BLACK MEDIUM
			SQUARE or WHITE MEDIUM SQUARE are not meant to indicate that the corresponding
			character must be presented in black or white, respectively; rather, the use
			of âblackâ and âwhiteâ in the names is generally just to contrast
			<strong>filled</strong> versus <strong>outline</strong> shapes, or a darker
			color fill versus a lighter color fill. Similarly, in other symbols such as
			the hands U+261A BLACK LEFT POINTING INDEX and U+261C WHITE LEFT POINTING
			INDEX, the words âwhiteâ and âblackâ also refer to outlined versus filled,
			and do not indicate skin color.
		</p>
		<p>However, other color words in the name, such as YELLOW,
			typically provide a recommendation as to the emoji presentation,
			which should be followed to avoid interoperability problems.</p>
		<p>In many cases the consensus for the best depiction has evolved
			in the time since the original formal name was standardized, and the preferred
			depiction is now better reflected by the CLDR short name. For example,
			U+1F483 DANCER should be designed in accordance with the CLDR short name
			<em>woman dancing</em> (an additional character was added for <em>man dancing</em>).
			In addition, only emoji characters have formal Unicode names; the emoji
			sequences just have CLDR short names.</p>
		<p>The formal Unicode name of each character must be unique, and
	  		sometimes distinguishing words are included in the name to maintain that
	  		uniqueness when two contrasting characters are added, such as:</p>
		<div><p> ð¶ 	U+1F436	DOG FACE<br> 
			ð 	U+1F415	DOG</p><p>
ð® 	U+1F42E	COW FACE<br>ð 	U+1F404	COW</p></div>
		<p>In cases such as these, the images must also contrast. However,
	  		in some cases additional terms like FACE were added to the name when they were
	  		not needed for uniqueness. There is no requirement that  an image contrast be
	  		maintained where there are not contrasting emoji. Consider the following emoji:</p>
		<div><p> ð¦ 	U+1F98C	DEER</p><p>  ð¦ 	U+1F993	ZEBRA FACE</p></div>
		<p> Because there are no other contrasting DEER or ZEBRA emoji,
			each of these two could be depicted with a face only, face and shoulders,
			full body, or other choices.</p>
		<h3>
			2.2 <a name="Display" href="#Display">Display</a>
		</h3>
		<p>Emoji characters may not always be displayed on a white
			background. They are often best given a faint, narrow contrasting
			border to keep the character visually distinct from a similarly
			colored background. Thus a Japanese flag would have a border so that
			it would be visible on a white background, and a Swiss flag have a
			border so that it is visible on a red background.</p>
		<p>Current practice is for emoji to have a square aspect ratio,
			deriving from their origin in Japanese. For interoperability, it is
			recommended that this practice be continued with current and future
			emoji. They will typically have about the same vertical placement and advance
			width as CJK ideographs. For example:</p>
		<p><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/emoji_advance_width.png" width="auto" height="49" alt="emoji_advance_width"></p>
		<p>They should use transparency for proper display for selection and with colored
			backgrounds:</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/emoji_transparency.png" width="auto" height="49" alt="emoji_transparency"></p>
        <p>The set of supported emoji sequences may vary by platform. For example,
			take the following emoji zwj sequence:</p>
		<p><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/black_flag.png" width="auto" height="49" alt="black_flag"><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/ZWJ.png" width="auto" height="49" alt="apple_1f3f4"><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/skull_and_crossbones.png" width="auto" height="49" alt="skull_and_crossbones"></p>
        <p>On a particular platform, it can be shown as a single image:</p>
			<p><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/PirateFlagEmoji.png" width="auto" height="49" alt="PirateFlagEmoji"></p>
		<p>However, if that combination is not supported as a single unit,
			it may show up as a sequence like the following, and the user sees no indication
			that it was meant to be composed into a single image:</p>
    		<p><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/black_flag.png" width="auto" height="49" alt="black_flag"><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/skull_and_crossbones.png" width="auto" height="49" alt="skull_and_crossbones"></p>

		<p>Implementations could provide an indication of the composed nature
			of an unsupported emoji sequence where possible. This gives users the additional
			information that that sequence was intended to have a composed form. It also
			explains why the sequence will not behave as separate elements: The arrow key
			will not move between the flag and the skull &amp; crossbones, and line breaks
			will not occur between apparently separate emoji.</p>
		<p>The following is an example of an approach that implementations can use. There are other approaches that could have a more intuitive appearance, but that could be difficult to implement with current text display mechanisms.</p>
        <p>Display the ZWJ as a visible âglueâ character, with zero or very narrow width.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/bridged-zwj.png" width="auto" height="49" alt="bridged zwj"></p>

		<p>It is often the case that gender is unknown or irrelevant, as in the usage

        <p>Gender-neutral versions of the profession or role emoji using

			2.3.2 <a name="marking-gender-in-input" href="#marking-gender-in-input">Marking
			Gender in Emoji Input</a>
		</h4>
		
		<p>Emoji input systems such as keyboards or palettes typically
			provide for input of some emoji whose appearance is explicitly genderedâfor
			example, emoji that appear specifically as a woman or man. When such emoji
			are not included in the table
			<em><strong><a href="#ExplicitGenderApperance">Emoji With Explicit Gender
			Appearance</a></strong></em>, the input system should generate a sequence for
			them that explicitly indicates the gendered appearance, rather than
			relying on a particular systemâs default appearance. This principle is shown
			with the following example:</p>
			
		<p>Assume on some system that the default appearance of
			<em>detective</em> is as <em>man detective</em>. On that system, when entering
			<em>man detective</em>, an input system should still use the explicit sequence
		</p><p><code>U+1F575 U+FE0F U+200D U+2642 U+FE0F</code> (<em>man detective</em>)</p>
		<p>rather than just</p>
		<p><code>U+1F575 U+FE0F</code> (<em>detective</em>)</p>

		<h3>
			2.4 <a name="Diversity" href="#Diversity">Diversity</a>
		</h3>
		<p>People all over the world want to have emoji that reflect more
			human diversity, especially for skin tone. The Unicode emoji
			characters for people and body parts are 
			intended to be generic and shown with a generic
			(nonhuman) appearance, such as a yellow/orange color similar to that used for
			smiley faces.</p>
		<p>
			Five symbol modifier characters that provide for a range of skin
			tones for human emoji were released in Unicode Version 8.0
			(mid-2015). These characters are based on the six tones of the
			Fitzpatrick scale, a recognized standard for dermatology (there are
			many examples of this scale online, such as <a href="https://www.arpansa.gov.au/sites/g/files/net3086/f/legacy/pubs/RadiationProtection/FitzpatrickSkinType.pdf">FitzpatrickSkinType.pdf<img src="http://unicode.org/img/external_link.png" alt="external link"></a>).
			The exact shades may vary between implementations.
		</p>
		<p><a name="Emoji_Modifiers_Table" href="#Emoji_Modifiers_Table">Emoji
						Modifiers</a></p>
		
		<p>These characters have been designed so that even where diverse
			color images for human emoji are not available, readers can see the
			intended meaning.</p>
		<p>
			When used alone, the default representation of these modifier characters
			is a color swatch. Whenever one of these characters <em>immediately</em>
			follows certain characters (such as WOMAN), then a font should show
			the sequence as a single glyph corresponding to the image for the
			person(s) or body part with the specified skin tone, such as the
			following:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/person.png" height="36" width="auto" alt=""><span size="36"> +&nbsp;</span><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/swatch-type-5.png" height="36" width="auto" alt=""><span size="36">&nbsp;â&nbsp;</span><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/person-5.png" height="36" width="auto" alt="">
		</p>
		<p>However, even if the font doesnât show the combined character,
			the user can still see that a skin tone was intended:</p>
		<p>
			<img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/person.png" height="36" width="auto" alt=""><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/swatch-type-5.png" height="36" width="auto" alt="">
		</p>
		<p>This may fall back to a black and white stippled or hatched
			image such as when colorful emoji are not supported.</p>
		<p>
			<img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/person-bw.png" height="36" width="auto" alt=""><span size="36"> +&nbsp;</span><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/swatch-type-4-bw.png" height="36" width="auto" alt=""><span size="36">&nbsp;â&nbsp;</span><img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/person-5-bw.png" height="36" width="auto" alt="">
		</p>
		<p>
			When a human emoji is not <em>immediately</em> followed by a emoji
			modifier character, it should use a generic, <em><a href="#non-realistic" name="non-realistic">non-realistic</a></em> skin
			tone, such as <img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/swatch-generic.png" height="18" width="auto" alt=""> <code>RGB #FFCC22</code> (one of the
			colors typically used for the smiley faces).
		</p>
		<p>No particular hair color is required, however, dark hair is generally
			regarded as more neutral because black or dark brown hair
			is widespread among people of every skin tone. This does not apply to emoji that
			already have an explicit hair color such as
			PERSON WITH BLOND HAIR (originally added for compatibility
			with Japanese mobile phone emoji), which needs to have blond hair
			regardless of skin tone.</p>

		<p>
			To have an effect on an emoji, an emoji modifier must immediately follow that
			base emoji character.
			Emoji presentation selectors are neither needed nor recommended for emoji
			characters when they are followed by emoji modifiers, and should not be used
			in newly generated emoji modifier sequences; the emoji modifier automatically
			implies the emoji presentation style. See
			<em><a href="#def_emoji_modifier_sequence">ED-13</a>. emoji modifier sequence</em>.
			However, some older data may include <em>defective</em> emoji modifier
			sequences in which an emoji presentation selector does occur between the
			base emoji character and the emoji modifier; this is the only exception
			to the rule that an emoji modifier must immediately follow the character
			that it modifies. In this case the emoji presentation selector should be
			ignored. For handling text presentation selectors in sequences, see
			<em>Section 4, <a href="#Presentation_Style">Presentation Style</a></em>.</p>

		<p>&lt;U+270C VICTORY HAND, FE0F, TYPE-3&gt;</p>
		<p>Any other intervening character causes the emoji
			modifier to appear as a free-standing character. Thus</p>

			A supported emoji modifier sequence should be treated as a single
			grapheme cluster for editing purposes (cursor moment, deletion,
			and so on); word break, line break, and so on. For input, the composition of
			that cluster does not need to be apparent to the user: it appears on
			the screen as a single image. On a phone, for example, a long press
			on a human figure can bring up a minipalette of different skin tones,
			without the user having to separately find the human figure and then
			the modifier. The following shows some possible appearances:
		</p>

		<p><a name="Minipalette" href="#Minipalette">Minipalettes</a></p>
		
		<p>
			Of course, there are many other types of diversity in human
			appearance besides different skin tones: Different hair styles and
			color, use of eyeglasses, various kinds of facial hair, different
			body shapes, different headwear, and so on. It is beyond the scope of
			Unicode to provide an encoding-based mechanism for representing every
			aspect of human appearance diversity that emoji users might want to
			indicate. The best approach for communicating very specific human
			imagesâor any type of image in which preservation of specific
			appearance is very importantâis the use of embedded graphics, as
			described in <a href="#Longer_Term">Longer Term Solutions</a>.

			2.5 <a href="#Emoji_ZWJ_Sequences" name="Emoji_ZWJ_Sequences">Emoji
				ZWJ Sequences</a>
		</h3>
		<p>The U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER (ZWJ) can be used between the
			elements of a sequence of characters to indicate that a single glyph
			should be presented if available. An implementation may use this
			mechanism to handle such an&nbsp;emoji zwj sequence&nbsp;as a single glyph,
			with a palette or keyboard that generates the appropriate sequences
			for the glyphs shown. To the user of such a system, these behave like
			single emoji characters, even though internally they are sequences.</p>
		<p>When an emoji zwj sequence is sent to a system that does not
			have a corresponding single glyph, the ZWJ characters are
			ignored and a fallback sequence of separate emoji is displayed.
			Thus an emoji zwj sequence should&nbsp;only&nbsp;be defined and supported by
			implementations where the fallback sequence would also make sense to
			a recipient.</p>
		<p>For example, the following are possible displays:</p>

		<p><a name="ZWJ_Display" href="#ZWJ_Display">ZWJ Sequence Display</a></p>
		
		<p>
			See also the <b>Emoji ZWJ Sequences</b> [<a href="#emoji_charts">emoji-charts</a>].
		</p>
		<p>The use of ZWJ sequences may be difficult in some
			implementations, so caution should taken before adding new sequences.
		</p>

			sequences, see <em>Section 2.7, <a href="#Emoji_Implementation_Notes">Emoji

			2.6 <a name="Multi_Person_Groupings" href="#Multi_Person_Groupings">Multi-Person

		</h3>
		<p>There are several emoji that depict more than one person interacting.

			special handling may be required on a case-by-case basis. These emoji are
			listed below:
		</p>
		<p><a name="MultiPersonGroupingsTable" href="#MultiPersonGroupingsTable">Multi-Person Groupings</a></p>
		
		<p>There are some other emoji that would share the same gender and skin tone,
		such as folded hands. As far as gender and skin tone are concerned, these behave just
		like  a single person and so need no special treatment. Other examples include:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>For U+1F486 <em>person getting massage</em>, the
		    hands of the person providing the massage should be depicted
		    with no skin tone showing, perhaps in gloves.</li>
		  <li>For the following emoji and their skin-tone
			variants, the infant should be depicted with no skin tone showing, perhaps
		    covered in a blanket, so that the emoji is treated as a single
		    person for purposes of skin tone modification:
		    <ul>
			  <li>U+1F931 <em>breast-feeding</em></li>
			  <li>U+1F469 U+200D U+1F37C <em>woman feeding baby</em></li>

		<h4>2.6.1 <a name="multiperson_gender" href="#multiperson_gender">Multi-Person Gender</a></h4>
		<p>The emoji for multi-person groupings have unspecified gender (unless

		<br>
		<h4>2.6.2 <a name="multiperson_skintones" href="#multiperson_skintones">Multi-Person Skin Tones</a></h4>
		<p>As with gender, skin tones can be applied to multi-person groupings
			in a similar manner. Emoji represented internally by sequences may have skin
			tone modifiers (<strong>Emoji_Modifier</strong> characters) added after each
			of the characters that take them (those with
			<strong>Emoji_Modifier_Base</strong>). This is illustrated by the table
			<a href="#SkinTonesForGroupingsUsingSequences">Skin Tones for Multi-Person
			Groupings Using Sequences</a> below.</p>

		<p>Multi-person sequences that mix people characters without skin tones and
			people characters with skin tones should not be generated. That is, for
			an input system, if one person character in a multi-person emoji sequence
			has a skin tone modifier, then all people characters in that sequence should
			have skin tone modifiers.</p>

		<p>In Emoji 12.0, the Emoji_Modifier_Base property, emoji modifier sequences and
			<a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/12.0/emoji-zwj-sequences.txt">RGI
			ZWJ sequences</a> were updated to add 25 skin tone
			combinations for woman and man holding hands, and 15 combinations each for women
			holding hands, men holding hands, and people holding hands. These sequences
			appear as 70 different images.</p>
		<p>In Emoji 12.1, the RGI ZWJ sequences for women holding hands,
			men holding hands, and people holding hands were further updated to add 10
			more sequences each, so their sequences correspond to those for woman and man
			holding hands. The new sequences are for people of different skin tones, but
			with the darker skin tone later in the sequence instead of earlier. For example:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Emoji 12.0 sequence: 1F468 <strong>1F3FD</strong> 200D 1F91D 200D
			1F468 <strong>1F3FB</strong> ; men holding hands: <strong>medium</strong> skin tone, <strong>light</strong> skin tone </p>
		<p>Emoji 12.1 addition: 1F468 <strong>1F3FB</strong> 200D 1F91D 200D
			1F468 <strong>1F3FD</strong> ; men holding hands: <strong>light</strong> skin tone, <strong>medium</strong> skin tone </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The only difference between the above sequences is that the inferred
			positions of the medium-skin-tone man and the light-skin-tone man are swapped, left
			and right.</p>
		<p>Implementations can use the same image for both sequences. For the
			multi-person emoji, implementations are not required to have different images for
			people of the same gender depending solely on position. The choice of whether to
			do so may depend on design considerations specific to particular vendor images.</p>
		<p>Other multi-person groups with different skin tone combinations can be represented
			as valid sequences, but are not yet RGI; adding mixed skin tones to families
			would add 4,225 emoji sequences, for example.</p>
		<p><a name="SkinTonesForGroupingsUsingSequences" href="#SkinTonesForGroupingsUsingSequences">Skin
			Tones for Multi-Person Groupings Using Sequences</a></p>
		
		
		<p>Skin tone modifiers can be applied to each of the nine characters listed
			in the table <strong><a href="#MultiPersonGroupingsTable">Multi-Person Groupings</a></strong>;
			examples for some of these characters are illustrated in the following table.
			This gives all of the people in the group the same skin tone, which is similar
			to how the gender marker works.</p>
		<p>However, in Emoji 12.0 through 13.0, such emoji modifier
			sequences only have RGI status for three of the nine characters: woman and man
			holding hands, men holding hands, and women holding hands.</p>

			2.8 <a name="hair_components" href="#hair_components">Hair Components</a>
		</h3>
	    <p>Emoji Version 11.0 introduced hair components, which can be used in ZWJ sequences to
	    	indicate hair colors or styles. The sequences recommended for general interchange (RGI)
	    	are listed in the data files. The components include:</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Red-haired (ginger)</li>
		    <li>Curly-haired</li>
		    <li>White-haired</li>
		    <li>Bald</li>
	      </ul>
		  <p>There are hundreds of possible distinctions among hair colors and styles, but to limit
		  	the number of combinationsâand because emoji are presented with a âcartoonâ styleâthere
		  	is a small number of hair components. Note that the hair color blond has already been
		  	provided for by an explicit blond man/woman/person emoji. Brown/black-haired are already
		  	typical defaults for hair color in human-form emoji.</p>
		  <h3>2.9 <a name="color" href="#color">Color</a> </h3>
          <p>Nine large colored square emoji may be used in ZWJ sequences to
            indicate that a base emoji should be displayed with that color if possible. The color
            of the resulting image may not be  exactly the same as the color square. The color
            squares used for this purpose are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> U+2B1B	BLACK LARGE SQUARE</li>
            <li>U+2B1C	WHITE LARGE SQUARE</li>
            <li> 	U+1F7E5	LARGE RED SQUARE â¦   	U+1F7EB	LARGE BROWN SQUARE</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Where the implementation does not provide a single emoji image in that color, the user should see the
			fallback appearance showing an indication of the desired color. Where color ZWJ
			sequences are supported and the base emoji already has that color, the color square
			should be ignored.</p>
 		<p><a name="EmojiGlyphColorExamples" href="#EmojiGlyphColorExamples">Emoji

			<p>The squares require a ZWJ; they do not behave like the five skin-tone modifiers

			<p>The <em>white square</em> emoji is often presented as a light gray, to set

		<p>Emoji with glyphs that face to the right or left may face either direction, according to

		text across platforms. The following ZWJ mechanism can be used to explicitly indicate direction. If the base emoji image is not available facing in that direction, the user should see the fallback appearance showing an indication of the desired direction. If direction ZWJ sequences are supported and the base emoji already faces that direction, the direction emoji should be ignored.</p>
 		<p><a name="EmojiGlyphDirectionExamples" href="#EmojiGlyphDirectionExamples">Emoji

		<h2>
			3 <a name="Identification" href="#Identification">Which
				Characters are Emoji</a>
		</h2>
		<p>There are different ways to count the emoji in Unicode, especially
			because an emoji sequence may display as a single
			emoji image. The following provides an overview of the ways to count
			emoji; it can be (for example):</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The count of code points that can be used in emoji, though this includes some code
		  points that are only used as part of sequences and donât have emoji appearance by
		  themselves;</li>
		  <li>All sequences of one or more characters that can appear as a single glyph (which is
		  probably closer to what users think of as the number of emoji), though typically only a
		  subset of possible sequences are displayed as a single glyph on any platform, and some
		  sequences may be platform-specific extensions.</li>
	  </ul>
		<p>It is recommended that any font or keyboard whose goal is to support Unicode emoji
		should support the characters and sequences listed in the [<a href="#emoji_data">emoji-data</a>]
		data files. The best definition of the full set is in the emoji-test.txt file.</p>

	  <p>The <a name="Emoji_Counts" href="http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts-13.0/emoji-counts.html">Emoji
		Counts, v13.0</a> chart provides more detail about the various counts&nbsp;as of
		the current version of this specification. The various column
		and row headers are described in
		<a href="https://www.unicode.org/emoji/format.html#col-totals">Emoji Counts Key</a>.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The â<strong>Subtotal</strong>â row in the chart
			indicates the count of what users typically think of as emoji. For example,
			the 26 Regional Indicator (RI) code points are not included there; even though
			they have Emoji status, they are typically only used in pairs to represent
			flags.</li>
		  <li>Typical
			keyboards may normally present even fewer emoji, since they may use
			mechanisms like a long press to display modifier
			sequences for specific emoji, and would thus not
			simultaneously display all of the images associated with the chart rows that count
			emoji with explicit skin tones.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>Separate [<a href="#emoji_charts">emoji-charts</a>] provide more information on many of these subsets and others, for example:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Emoji characters that were released most recently are listed in&nbsp;<strong>Emoji Recently Added</strong>.</li>

	  <h2>
			4 <a name="Presentation_Style" href="#Presentation_Style">Presentation
				Style</a>
	  </h2>
		<p>Certain emoji have defined variation sequences, in which an emoji character
			can be followed by an invisible <a href="#def_emoji_presentation_selector">emoji presentation selector</a> or <a href="#def_text_presentation_selector">text presentation selector</a>.</p>
		<p>
			This capability was added in <a href="http://blog.unicode.org/2012/01/announcing-unicode-standard-version-61.html">Unicode
				6.1</a>. Some systems may also provide this distinction with higher-level
			markup, rather than variation sequences. For more information on these selectors,
			see <b>Emoji Presentation Sequences</b>
			[<a href="#emoji_charts">emoji-charts</a>]. For details
			regarding the use of emoji or text presentation selectors in emoji sequences
			specifically, see <em>Section 2.7, <a href="#Emoji_Implementation_Notes">Emoji
			Implementation Notes</a></em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Implementations should support both styles of presentation for the
			characters with emoji and text presentation sequences,
			if possible. Most of these characters are emoji that were unified with
			preexisting characters. Because people are now using emoji presentation for
			a broader set of characters, Unicode 9.0 added emoji and text
			presentation sequences for all emoji with default text presentation
			(see discussion below). These are the characters shown in the column labeled
			âDefault Text Style; no VS in U8.0â in the <b>Text
				vs Emoji</b> chart [<a href="#emoji_charts">emoji-charts</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			However, even for cases in which the emoji
			and text presentation selectors are available, it had
			not been clear for implementers whether the <em>default</em> presentation for
			pictographs should be emoji or text. That means that a piece of text
			may show up in a different style than intended when shared across
			platforms. While this is all a perfectly legitimate for Unicode
			charactersâ<em>presentation style is never guaranteed</em>âa shared
			sense among developers of when to use emoji presentation by default
			is important, so that there are fewer unexpected or jarring presentations.
			Implementations need to know what the generally expected default presentation is,
			to promote interoperability across platforms and applications.
		</p>
		<p>There had been no clear line for implementers between three
			categories of Unicode characters:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>emoji-default:</strong> those expected to have an
				emoji presentation by default, but can also have a text presentation</li>
			<li><strong>text-default:</strong> those expected to have a text
				presentation by default, but could also have an emoji presentation</li>
			<li><strong>text-only:</strong> those that should only have a
				text presentation</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			These categories can be distinguished using properties listed in <a href="#Emoji_Properties_and_Data_Files">Annex A: Emoji Properties and Data Files</a>. The
			first category are characters with <strong>Emoji=Yes</strong> and <strong>Emoji_Presentation=Yes</strong>.
			The second category are characters with <strong>Emoji=Yes</strong>
			and <strong>Emoji_Presentation=No</strong>. The third category are
			characters with <strong>Emoji=No</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>The presentation of a given emoji character depends on the
			environment, whether or not there is an emoji or text presentation
			selector, and the default presentation style (emoji versus text). In
			informal environments like texting and chats, it is more appropriate
			for most emoji characters to appear with a colorful emoji
			presentation, and only get a text presentation with a text presentation
			selector. Conversely, in formal environments such as word processing,
			it is generally better for emoji characters to appear with a text
			presentation, and only get the colorful emoji presentation with the
			emoji presentation selector.
		</p>
		<p>Based on those factors, here is typical presentation behavior.
			However, these guidelines may change with changing user expectations.

			are listed in <b>Emoji Variation Sequences</b>
			[<a href="#emoji_charts">emoji-charts</a>].
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition, the next two sections describe two other
			mechanisms for globally controlling the emoji presentation: Using
			language tags with locale extensions, or using special script codes.
			Though these are new mechanisms and not yet widely supported, vendors
			are encouraged to support the locale extension for most general usage
			such as in browsers; the special script codes may be appropriate for
			more specific usage such as OpenType font selection, or in APIs.
			For more information, see [<a href="#CLDR">CLDR</a>].

		<h3>
			4.2 <a name="Emoji_Locale_Extension" href="#Emoji_Locale_Extension">Emoji
				Locale Extension</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			The locale extension â-emâ can be used to specify desired
			presentation for characters that may have both text-style and emoji-style
			presentations available. There are three values that can be used, here
			illustrated with âsr-Latnâ:
		</p>
		<div>
		<table>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<th>Locale Code</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>sr-Latn-u-em-<strong>emoji</strong></td>
					<td>use an emoji presentation for emoji characters where
						possible</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>sr-Latn-u-em-<strong>text</strong></td>
					<td>use a text presentation for emoji characters where
						possible</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td nowrap="">sr-Latn-u-em-<strong>default</strong></td>
					<td>use the default presentation (only needed to reset an
						inherited -em setting).</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			This can be used in HTML, for example, with
			<code>&lt;html lang="sr-Latn-u-em-emoji"&gt;</code>.
			Note that this approach does not have the disadvantages listed below
			for the script-tag approach.
		</p>

		<h3>
			4.3 <a name="Emoji_Script" href="#Emoji_Script">Emoji Script Codes</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Two script subtags can be used to control the presentation style.
			These use script codes defined by ISO 15924 but given more
			specific semantics by CLDR, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_script_subtag_validity">unicode_script_subtag</a>:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Zsyeâprefer emoji style for characters that have both text and
				emoji styles available.</li>
			<li>Zsymâprefer text style for characters that have both text and
				emoji styles available.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			These script codes are not suitable for use in general language tags:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They cannot be used with language-script combinations; for example,
				if the language is sr-Latn (Serbian in Latin script), then Zsye
				cannot be used.</li>
			<li>They may confuse processes that depend on language tags, such as
				spell checkers.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			However, they may be useful by themselves in specific contexts such as
			OpenType font selection, or in APIs that take script codes.</p>

		<p>
			Neither the Unicode code point order, nor the default

			separate conceptually-related characters. From the user's perspective, the
			ordering in the following selection of characters sorted by DUCET appears
			quite random, as illustrated by the following example:</p>

			This ordering presents a cleaner and more expected
			ordering for sorted lists of characters. The groupings include:
			faces, people, body-parts, emotion, clothing, animals, plants, food,
			places, transport, and so on. The ordering also groups more naturally
			for the purpose of selection in input palettes. However, for sorting,
			each character must occur in only one position, which is not a
			restriction for input palettes. See <em>Section 6, <a href="#Input">Input</a></em>.

		<p>
			Emoji are not typically typed on a keyboard. Instead, they are
			generally picked from a palette, or recognized via a dictionary. The
			mobile keyboards typically have a <img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/ref/ref_263a.png" alt="âº" width="auto" height="14"> button to select a palette
			of emoji, such as in the left image below. Clicking on the <img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/ref/ref_263a.png" alt="âº" width="auto" height="14">
			button reveals a palette, as in the right image.
		</p>
		<p><a name="Palette_Input" href="#Palette_Input">Palette Input</a></p>
		<div>
		<table>
			<tbody><tr>
				<td><p><img alt="palette1" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/open-emoji-palette.png" width="auto" height="220">
					</p></td>
				<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
				<td><p><img alt="palette1" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/emoji-palette.png" width="auto" height="220">
					</p></td>
			</tr>
		</tbody></table>
		</div>
		<p>
			The palettes need to be organized in a meaningful way for
			users. They typically provide a small number of broad categories,
			such as People, Nature, and so on. These categories typically have
			100-200 emoji.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many characters can be categorized in multiple ways: an orange
			is both a plant and a food. Unlike a sort order, an input palette can
			have multiple instances of a single character. It can thus extend the
			sort ordering to add characters in any groupings where people might
			reasonably be expected to look for them.
		</p>
		<p>
			More advanced palettes will have long-press enabled, so that
			people can press-and-hold on an emoji and have a set of related emoji
			pop up. This allows for faster navigation, with less scrolling
			through the palette.
		</p>
		<p>
			Annotations for emoji characters are much more finely grained
			keywords. They can be used for searching characters, and are often
			easier than palettes for entering emoji characters. For example, when
			someone types âhourglassâ on their mobile phone, they could see and
			pick from either of the matching emoji characters <img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_23f3.png" alt="â³" width="auto" height="14">
			or <img alt="â" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_231b.png" width="auto" height="14">. That is often much easier than scrolling through
			the palette and visually inspecting the screen. Input mechanisms may
			also map <em>emoticons</em> to emoji as keyboard shortcuts: typing
			:-) can result in <img height="14" width="auto" alt="ð" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/twitter/twitter_1f604.png">.
		</p>
		<p>
			In some input systems, a word or phrase bracketed by colons is used
			to explicitly pick emoji characters. Thus typing in âI saw an <em>:ambulance:</em>â
			is converted to âI saw an <img height="14" width="auto" alt="ð" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/android/android_1f691.png">â. For completeness,
			such systems might support all of the full Unicode names, such as <em>:first
				quarter moon with face:</em> for <img height="14" width="auto" alt="ð" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_1f31b.png">. Spaces within the phrase
			may be represented by _, as in the following:
		</p>
		<p>
			âmy <em>:alarm_clock:</em> didnât workâ
		</p>
		<p>
			<span size="36">&nbsp;â&nbsp;</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			âmy <img height="14" width="auto" alt="â°" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/android/android_23f0.png"> didnât workâ.
		</p>
		<p>However, in general the full Unicode names are not especially
			suitable for that sort of use; they were designed to be unique
			identifiers, and tend to be overly long or confusing.</p>
		<p>For emoji that have gender and/or skin tone variants, input
			systems should fully specify the intended appearance, rather than relying
			on a particular systemâs default appearance; see for example
			<em>Section 2.3.2, <a href="#marking-gender-in-input">Marking Gender in Emoji
			Input</a></em>.</p>
		<h2>
			7 <a name="Searching" href="#Searching">Searching</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			Searching includes both searching for emoji characters in queries,
			and finding emoji characters in the target. These are most useful
			when they include the annotations as synonyms or hints. For example,
			when someone searches for <img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/twitter/twitter_26fd.png" alt="â½" width="auto" height="14"> on <a target="yelp" href="https://www.yelp.com/search#find_desc=%E2%9B%BD">yelp.com<img src="http://unicode.org/img/external_link.png" alt="external link"></a>,
			they see matches for âgas stationâ. Conversely, searching for âgas
			pumpâ in a search engine could find pages containing <img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/twitter/twitter_26fd.png" alt="â½" width="auto" height="14">. Similarly, searching for âgas pumpâ in an email
			program can bring up all the emails containing <img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/twitter/twitter_26fd.png" alt="â½" width="auto" height="14">.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is no requirement for uniqueness in both palette categories and
			annotations: an emoji should show up wherever users would expect it.
			A gas pump <img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/twitter/twitter_26fd.png" alt="â½" width="auto" height="14"> might show up under âobjectâ and
			âtravelâ; a heart <img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/android/android_1f494.png" alt="ð" width="auto" height="14"> under âheartâ and
			âemotionâ, a <img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/twitter/twitter_1f63b.png" alt="ð»" width="auto" height="14"> under âanimalâ, âcatâ, and âheartâ.
		</p>
		<p>
			Annotations are language-specific: searching on <a target="yelp" href="https://www.yelp.de/search#find_desc=%E2%9B%BD">yelp.de<img src="http://unicode.org/img/external_link.png" alt="external link"></a>,
			someone would expect a search for <img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/twitter/twitter_26fd.png" alt="â½" width="auto" height="14"> to result in matches for âTankstelleâ. Thus
			annotations need to be in multiple languages to be useful across
			languages. They should also include regional annotations within a
			given language, like âpetrol stationâ, which people would expect
			search for <img src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/twitter/twitter_26fd.png" alt="â½" width="auto" height="14"> to result in on <a target="yelp" href="https://www.yelp.co.uk/search#find_desc=%E2%9B%BD">yelp.co.uk<img src="http://unicode.org/img/external_link.png" alt="external link"></a>.
			An English annotation cannot simply be translated into different
			languages, because different words may have different associations in
			different languages. The emoji <img width="auto" height="14" alt="ðµ" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/apple/apple_1f335.png" title="U+1F335 ðµ cactus">
			may be associated with Mexican or Southwestern restaurants in the US,
			but not be associated with them in, say, Greece.
		</p>
		<p>
			As noted in <em>Section 2.1 <a href="#Names">Names</a></em>,
			there is one further kind of annotation, called a CLDR
			short name. This is also referred to as the <em>TTS name</em>, for
			use in text-to-speech processing
			such as providing a short, descriptive emoji name when reading text
			for accessibility purposes. In this case the CLDR names
			provide several advantages over formal Unicode character names:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They can be shorter and less cumbersome than the formal
				name, whose requirement for name uniqueness often
				results in names that are overly long, such as
				<em>BLACK RIGHT-POINTING TRIANGLE WITH DOUBLE VERTICAL BAR</em> for
				<img alt="â¯" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/windows/windows_23ef.png" width="auto" height="14">.</li>
			<li>They can apply to emoji that are represented by
				sequences as well as those represented by single characters.</li>
			<li>They can be updated to better reflect current emoji
				depictions and usage.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			TTS names are also outside the current scope of this document.
		</p>
		<h2>
			8 <a name="Longer_Term" href="#Longer_Term">Longer Term Solutions</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			The longer-term goal for implementations should be to support
			embedded graphics, in addition to the emoji characters. Embedded
			graphics allow arbitrary emoji symbols, and are not dependent on
			additional Unicode encoding. Some examples of this are found in Skype
			and LINE.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, to be as effective and simple to use as emoji
			characters, a full solution requires significant infrastructure
			changes to allow simple, reliable input and transport of images
			(stickers) in texting, chat, mobile phones, email programs, virtual
			and mobile keyboards, and so on. (Even so, such images will never
			interchange in environments that only support plain text, such as
			email addresses.) Until that time, many implementations will need to
			use Unicode emoji instead.</p>
		<p>
			For example, mobile keyboards need to be enhanced. Enabling embedded
			graphics would involve adding an additional custom mechanism for
			users to add in their own graphics or purchase additional sets, such
			as a <img width="auto" height="14" alt="â" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/android/android_2795.png"> sign to add an image to
			the palette above. This would prompt the user to paste or otherwise
			select a graphic, and add annotations for dictionary selection.
		</p>
		<p>
			With such an enhanced mobile keyboard, the user could then
			select those graphics in the same way as selecting the Unicode emoji.
			If users started adding many custom graphics, the mobile keyboard
			might even be enhanced to allow ordering or organization of those
			graphics so that they can be quickly accessed. The extra graphics
			would need to be disabled if the target of the mobile keyboard (such
			as an email header line) would only accept text.</p>
		<p>
			Other features required to make embedded graphics work well
			include the ability of images to scale with font size, inclusion of
			embedded images in more transport protocols, switching services and
			applications to use protocols that do permit inclusion of embedded
			images (for example, MMS versus SMS for text messages). There will always,
			however, be places where embedded graphics canât be usedâsuch as
			email headers, SMS messages, or file names. There are also privacy
			aspects to implementations of embedded graphics: if the graphic
			itself is not packaged with the text, but instead is just a reference
			to an image on a server, then that server could track usage.</p>

		<p>While the syntax of a well-formed <em><strong>emoji flag sequence</strong></em> is defined in <em><strong><a href="#def_emoji_flag_sequence">ED-14</a></strong></em>,
			only valid sequences are displayed as flags by conformant implementations, where:
	  </p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The valid region sequences are specified by <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_region_subtag">Unicode
		    region subtags</a> as defined in [<a href="#CLDR">CLDR</a>], with
	      idStatus=regular, deprecated, or macroregion. For macroregions,
	      only <strong>UN</strong> and <strong>EU</strong> are valid.</li>
	  </ul>
		<p>Deprecated region
				sequences should not be generated, but may be supported for backward
				compatibility. Macroregion region
			    sequences  generally do not have official flags, with the exception of
			    <strong>UN</strong> and <strong>EU</strong>.</p>
	  <p> Some region sequences represent countries (as recognized by the United
		  Nations, for example); others represent territories that are
		  associated with a country. Such territories may have flags of their own,
		  or may use the flag of the country with which they are associated. Depictions
		  of images for flags may be subject to constraints by the administration of
		  that region.</p>
		<p>Caveats:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Although a pair of REGIONAL INDICATOR symbols is referred to as an
				emoji_flag_sequence, it really represents a specific region, not a
				specific flag for that region. The actual flag displayed for the pair may be
				different on different platforms, for example for territories which do
				not have an	official flag. The displayed flag may change over time as
				regions change their flags and platforms update their software.</li>
			<li>For some territories (especially those without separate official flags),
				the displayed flag may be the same as the flag for the country
				with which they are associated. For more about cases where characters
				have the same appearance, see <em>UTR #36: Unicode Security
				Considerations</em> [<a href="#UTR36">UTR36</a>].</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For additional information see the sub-section on Regional Indicator Symbols
			in <i>Section 22.10, Enclosed and Square</i> of
			[<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>].
		</p>

		<h3>B.1
			<a name="Flag_Presentation" href="#Flag_Presentation">Presentation</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Emoji are generally presented with a square aspect ratio, which
			presents a problem for flags. The flag for Qatar
			is over 150% wider than tall; for Switzerland
			it is square; for Nepal it is over 20% taller
			than wide. To avoid a ransom-note effect, implementations may want to
			use a fixed ratio across all flags, such as 150%, with a blank band
			on the top and bottom. (The average width for flags is between 150%
			and 165%.) 
			Presentation as a waving flag, or clipping to a
			circle, can help to present a uniform appearance, masking the aspect
			differences.
		</p>
		<p>Flags should have a visible edge. One option is to use a one-pixel gray
			line chosen to be contrasting with the adjacent field color.</p>
		<p>
			For an open-source set of flag images (png and svg), see <a href="https://github.com/googlei18n/region-flags">region-flags<img src="http://unicode.org/img/external_link.png" alt="external link"></a>.
		</p>
		<p>Options for presenting an emoji_flag_sequence for which
			a system does not have a specific flag or other glyph include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Display each REGIONAL INDICATOR symbol separately as a letter in a
				dotted square, as shown in the Unicode charts. This provides
				information about the specific region indicated, but may be mystifying
				to some users.</li>
			<li>For all unsupported REGIONAL INDICATOR pairs, display the same
				missing flag glyph, such as the image shown below.
				This would indicate that the supported pair was intended to represent
				the flag of some region, without indicating which one.
				<p><img alt="" src="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/images/other/black-flag-unknown.png" title="unsupported flag" height="36px" width="auto"></p></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>B.2 <a name="Flag_Ordering" href="#Flag_Ordering">Ordering</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			The code point order of flags is by region code, which will not be
			intuitive for users, because that rarely matches the order of
			countries in the userâs language. English speakers are surprised
			that the flag for Germany comes before the flag for Djibouti. An
			alternative is to present the sorted order according to the localized
			country name, using [<a href="#CLDR">CLDR]</a> data.
		</p>
		<h2>Annex C: <a name="valid-emoji-tag-sequences" href="#valid-emoji-tag-sequences">Valid Emoji Tag Sequences</a></h2>
		<p>While the syntax of a well-formed emoji tag sequence is defined in
			<em><strong><a href="#def_emoji_tag_sequence">ED-14a</a></strong></em>, not
			all possible tag sequences are valid. The only valid sequences in this version
			of Unicode Emoji are defined by sections in this annex, which specify valid
			combinations of &lt;<code>tag_base</code>&gt; characters and
			&lt;<code>tag_spec</code>&gt; sequences and their expected presentation. Conformant implementations only
			display valid sequences as emoji, and display invalid sequences with a special presentation to show that they are invalid, such as in the examples below.</p>
		<p>There is one common constraint on valid emoji tag sequences:
			<em>the entire emoji_tag_sequence, including tag_base and tag_end, must not be
		  longer than 32 code points</em>. This provides a practical limit needed by
			many rendering systems, and is consistent with the 32-code-point buffer limit
			specified for the Stream-Safe Text Format as defined in
			<em>UAX #15: Unicode Normalization Forms</em> [<a href="#UAX15">UAX15</a>].</p>
			<p>If a platform supports tag sequences, but a particular  emoji tag sequence is invalid
			  or cannot be displayed, then to reduce spoofing risk that emoji tag sequence should be
			  displayed using a <em>missing emoji glyph</em> if feasible. The following are examples,
			  where the <code>tag_base</code> character is a <em>black flag</em>.</p>

			      <td>The implementation supports tag sequences, but  this particular sequence is either not supported or simply invalid. (If the font technology permits, the missing emoji glyph can be overlaid on the <code>tag_base</code> character, thus occupying the same physical dimensions as if the sequence were supported.)</td>

			      <td>The implementation does not support tag sequences at all. (The tag characters are normally invisible, and thus only the base character displays.)</td>

		<p>In examples in this section, underlined ASCII characters represent
			the corresponding tag characters, while <u>â¦</u> represents the <code>tag_end</code>.</p>
		<h3>C.1 <a name="flag-emoji-tag-sequences" href="#flag-emoji-tag-sequences">Flag
			Emoji Tag Sequences</a></h3>
		<p>A valid flag emoji tag sequence must satisfy the following constraints:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>The <code>tag_base</code> and <code>tag_spec</code> are limited to the following:
		<table>
	    <tbody>
	      <tr>
	        <td><code>tag_base</code></td>
	        <td>U+1F3F4 BLACK FLAG</td>
          </tr>
	      <tr>
	        <td><code>tag_spec</code></td>
	        <td>(U+E0030 TAG DIGIT ZERO .. U+E0039 TAG DIGIT NINE,<br>U+E0061 TAG LATIN SMALL LETTER A .. U+E007A TAG LATIN SMALL LETTER Z)+</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
	  </table></li>
		  <li>Let SD be the result of mapping each character in the <code>tag_spec</code> to a character in [0-9a-z]&nbsp;by subtracting 0xE0000.
<ol>
        <li>SD must then be a specification as per [<a href="#CLDR">CLDR</a>] of either a Unicode&nbsp;<a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/index.html#unicode_subdivision_id">subdivision_id</a> or a 3-digit&nbsp;<a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/index.html#unicode_region_subtag">unicode_region_subtag</a>, and</li>
        <li>SD must have CLDR idStatus equal to "regular" or "deprecated".</li>
</ol>
		  </li>
	  </ol>
		<p>Notes:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>The deprecated SD values are only included for compatibility, and should not be used. They are included so that  deprecations in the future do not invalidate previously valid emoji tag sequences.</li>
		  <li>There is no hyphen in the <code>tag_spec</code>, unlike ISO subdivisions like âGB-SCTâ.</li>
		  <li>These flag emoji tag sequences are used to request an image for whatever is currently the flag of the specified subregion. Like the emoji flag sequences, they are&nbsp;not&nbsp;intended to provide a mechanism for <em>versioned</em> representations of any particular flag image.</li>
		  <li>Specific platforms and programs decide which emoji extended flag sequences they will support. There is no requirement that any be supported, and no expectation that more than a small number be commonly supported by vendors.</li>
		  <li>Note that SD cannot be a two-letter code like "US" or "us".</li>

		<h4>C.1.1 <a name="Sample_Valid_Emoji_Tag_Sequences" href="#Sample_Valid_Emoji_Tag_Sequences">Sample Valid Emoji Tag Sequences</a></h4>
	  <p>A completely tag-unaware implementation will display any any sequence of tag characters as invisible, without any effect on adjacent characters. The following sections apply to conformant implementations that  support at least one tag sequence.	  </p>
	  <p>An implementation may support emoji tag sequences, but not support a particular valid emoji tag sequence.</p>
	  <p>Images for unsupported valid emoji tag sequences must indicate that the sequence image is missing, by showing the base glyph with either a following âmissing emoji glyphâ or with an overlay âmissingâ glyph. The overlay glyph approach is recommended, so that the sequence would have the same width as if supported. A tag-unaware implementation (TU) will show just the base character.</p>
