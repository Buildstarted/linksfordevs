Despite visual similarities to their other MKR form factor boards, and putting aside the lack of classic Arduino blue color, this new board isn’t really like other Arduinos. Designed for industry, not makers, the new Portenta is rather different.</span></p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL">The first Arduino boards were arrived back in what seems almost like pre-history now, all the way back in 2005, but it wasn’t until the introduction of the Arduino Uno, which didn’t come along until 2010, that the boards really become one of the pillars of the maker movement.</p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL"><span>However, a lot has changed over the course of the last decade.

Or at least, not quickly enough.</span></p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL"><span>But over the last year (or two) things have started changing a lot more quickly. While the classic Arduino form factor may be </span><a href="https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/11/05/welcoming-new-humble-masterpieces-into-momas-collection/" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue" rel="nofollow">iconic,</a><span> it </span><a href="https://blog.hackster.io/introducing-two-new-boards-from-arduino-f4654b7bd0ec" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue" rel="nofollow">is also dying.</a><span> The ‘legacy’ Uno form factor is </span><a href="https://blog.hackster.io/introducing-the-arduino-uno-wifi-7118f428ad39" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue" rel="nofollow">still around,</a><span> and it’s likely to stick around for more than a few more years yet, but increasingly newer boards from Arduino use the more modern </span><a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino/arduino-mkr-family" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue" rel="nofollow">MKR form factor,</a><span> while the </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/introducing-four-new-arduino-nanos-869b8abbccb4" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue" rel="nofollow">return of the Arduino Nano </a><span>has allowed the company to remain competative at the cheaper end of the market.</span></p><p class="hckui__typography__bodyL">Other changes have been a bit more subtle than new hardware, but in a way, far more significant, and may be indicating a change of direction for the entire company.</p><div><div class="image_carousel__container__hMJxn undefined"><p class="image_carousel__caption__2sZrD"><span>The Arduino Portenta H7 module.

So perhaps the biggest amongst the indicators was the </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/arduino-pro-development-environment-announced-at-maker-faire-rome-06da6ab01e32" class="hckui__typography__linkBlue" rel="nofollow">arrival of the Arduino Pro Development Environment,</a><span> announced at the tail end of last year at Maker Faire Rome.
