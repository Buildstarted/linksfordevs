    <p>Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) is planning to reopen schools in August. If there is a resurgence of the COVID-19 virus that requires a closure of schools, FCPS is prepared to provide all students with online distance learning.</p>

<p>For the coming year, parents and caregivers have two learning options for their students:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Full-time online instruction OR</li>
	<li>In-person instruction with social distancing in our school buildings.</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage families to choose their option based on health and safety concerns rather than on the availability of course or program options. School schedules, available courses, and participation in school activities may be limited in either option. However, both options will meet all state standards of learning and graduation requirements.</p>

<p>To help staff plan, parents and caregivers need to commit to one of these options (below) for the entire 2020-21 school year for each child. If health conditions improve that would allow FCPS to resume in-person instruction for all students, we would reassess FCPS’s operating status at that time.</p>

<p><em>Responses are due by July 10, 2020. If no response is received, the student will automatically be enrolled for in-person instruction for the year.</em></p>
