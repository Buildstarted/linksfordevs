Even mobile manufacturer Huawei appeared on the list.</p><p>Each entry links to evidence and testimonials from employees decrying the amount of overtime worked, either via screenshots of internal emails and other documents, or through employee reviews on sites like <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/53318899">Zhihu</a> and <a href="https://www.kanzhun.com/gsr15379tl56.html?ka=review-label14">Kanzhun</a>.</p><p>While the 996 practice was reported as far bas as September 2016, according to the website, it seems to have ramped up since the start of this year, with most of the additions to GitHub having been added in the past couple of months.</p><p>As the movement spread, <a href="https://qz.com/1589309/996-icu-github-hosts-chinese-tech-worker-complaints/">Quartz</a> reports Chinese browsers -- including Tencent's QQ browser, Alibaba's UC browser, and Qihoo's 360 browser -- have blocked access to the GitHub repository.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/22/microsoft-workers-decry-grueling-996-working-standard-at-chinese-tech-firms">The Guardian</a> reports that employees at Microsoft, which owns GitHub, have published a letter on the site calling for Microsoft to keep the repository "uncensored and available to everyone."</p><p>The letter was first published with 30 signatures, but more have been added as awareness increases and the Microsoft staff are calling for more support.</p><p><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> has contacted the named games firms for comment.</p><p><em>If you have jobs news to share or a new hire you want to shout about, please contact us on <a href="mailto:newhires@gamesindustry.biz">newhires@gamesindustry.biz</a></em></p></main></article></div></div>
