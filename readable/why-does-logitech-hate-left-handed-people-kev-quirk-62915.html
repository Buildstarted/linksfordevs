I asked for recommendations on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">Fosstodon</a> and the overwhelming recommendation was the <a href="https://amzn.to/3hueW6x">Logitech M570</a>. Unfortunately, Logitech donâ€™t make a left handed version, and after a bit of research it seems that the issue goes much further than just this device.</p><p>Now, many standard mice can be used with either hand as theyâ€™re symmetrical. But if you want to use an ergonomic mouse, be it trackball or traditional, these are specific to one hand or another.</p><p>The problem with Logitech is that they donâ€™t make <em>any </em>left handed mice, in any of their ranges. So although my initial search was for a trackball, this covers all mice they produce. For example, <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/mx-master-business?crid=7">this one</a>.</p><h2>Why Logitech hates left handed people</h2><p>If you take a look around the <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/search#q=left%20handed&amp;s=all&amp;p=9">Logitech forums</a>, you will see 279 pages of search results from people complaining about the lack of left handed support from Logitech.</p><p><strong>There are posts going back years</strong>; some have responses from Logitech team members, others have just been ignored. The problem is, every post Iâ€™ve seen has had the same regurgitation of a cookie cutter response.</p><p>Posts like <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360034826514-MX-Master-3-Still-no-Left-Handed-Model-">this one from 9 months ago</a> where the poster is requesting a left handed mouse, gets the following response from Logitech:</p><blockquote><p>The left handed version the MX Master 3 is not yet available and we do not have any information on when a left handed version would be available.</p><p>Iâ€™ll have this post forwarded to the proper team here on my endâ€¦</p><cite>Logitech support</cite></blockquote><p>In another post, <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360035820194-MX-MASTER-3-for-left-handed">also from 9 months ago</a>, Logitech reply <strong>4 months later</strong> with the following:</p><blockquote><p>Thank you for reaching Logitech! We deeply apologize for not providing a prompt response.</p><p>As with your inquiry about the MX Master 3, the manufactured device at the moment are intended for people who use their mouse using their right hand.[â€¦] We will forward this post to our team for consideration.</p><cite>Logitech support</cite></blockquote><p>Thereâ€™s also <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360038254493-Left-handed-MX-mice">this post</a> from 5 months ago, <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360032456014-Left-handed">this post</a> from 2 years ago and <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360032235714-left-handed-mouse">this post</a> from <strong>3 years ago</strong>. And thatâ€™s just in the first 3 of those 279 pages of results!</p><p>The forums are littered with posts from fellow lefties pleading with Logitech to create a left handed mouse. But many years later, weâ€™re still <em>left </em>out in the cold.</p><h2>Discrimination?</h2><p>According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness">around 10% of the worldâ€™s population are left handed</a>. Ten percent may not sound like a lot, but thatâ€™s the equivalent population of the USA, Japan, Brazil &amp; Germany <strong>combined</strong>. Thatâ€™s a lot of people!</p><p>On their website, Logitech say the following about their <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse">MX Ergo trackball</a> mouse:</p><blockquote><p>Logitechâ€™s most advanced trackball for trackball enthusiasts and consumers searching for alternatives to mice and touchpads. Delivers 20% less muscular strain compared to a regular mouse.</p><cite>Logitech</cite></blockquote><p>So does the muscular strain of left handed people not matter to you, Logitech? I suppose those <strong>780 million </strong>left handed people worldwide donâ€™t really matter, hey?</p><p>Iâ€™d like to finally add that the title of this post is facetious. I know that Logitech donâ€™t <em>hate </em>left handed people. Itâ€™s ok Logitech, I still really like your hardware, but it would be wonderful if you offered some ergonomic mice for left handed people. ðŸ™‚</p></div></article><div><h2>Subscribe for more!</h2><p>You will receive monthly emails with updates and previews of upcoming posts.
