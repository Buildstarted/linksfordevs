    <p><a href="http://callvirt.net/blog/entry.aspx?entryid=b9a94d0c-761a-4d6b-bc2f-d6a5f8c1a4a7">As Joel points out</a>, we've made a draft of the <em>SSCLI 2.0 Internals</em> book available for download (via his blog). Rather than tell you all about the book, which Joel summarizes quite well, instead I thought I'd tell you about the process by which the book came to be.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Editor's note: if you have no interest in the process by which a book can get done, skip the rest of this blog entry.</em></p></blockquote> <p>One thing that readers will note that's different about this version of "the Rotor book" is that it's <em>not</em> being done through one of the traditional publishers. This is deliberate. As Joel and I talk about on the <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=360">.NET Rocks! show we did together</a>, the first Rotor book was on the first version of Rotor, which shipped shortly after the .NET 1.1 bits shipped to customers. That was back in the summer of 2001. Dave, Geoff and I shipped the book, I did a few conference talks on Rotor for the relatively few people who had an interest in what was going on "under the hood" of the CLR, and then we all sort of parted ways. (Dave retired from Microsoft entirely shortly thereafter, in order "to focus on the two things that matter in life: making music and making wine", as he put it.) Mission accomplished, we moved on.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as we all knew would happen, the world moved on--Whidbey (.NET 2.0) shipped, and with it came a whole slew of CLR enhancements, most notably generics. Unlike how generics happened in the JVM, CLR generics are carried through all the way to the type system, and as a result, a lot of what we said in the first Rotor book was instantly rendered obsolete. Granted, one could always grab the Gyro patch for Rotor and see what generics would have looked like, but even that was pretty much rendered obsolete by the emergence of the SSCLI 2.0 drop, bringing the Rotor code up to date with the Whidbey production CLR release.</p> <p>Except the book was, to be blunt about it, left behind.</p> <p>Speaking honestly, the book never broke any sales records. Sure, for a while there it was the #1 best-selling book (in Redmond, WA, to my <em>total</em> shock and surprise) on Amazon, but we never had the kind of best-seller success that that of, say, <em>Programming Ruby</em> or pick-your-favorite-ASP.NET book. In the book publishing world, this was kind of the moral equivalent to watching your neighbors' slide show of their vacation: boring for most people <em>not</em> in the pictures, unless you were <em>really</em> interested in either the place they were visiting or what they did there. Most of our audience were either people working on the CLR itself (hence all the copies sold in Redmond, get it?), people who were researching on the CLR (such as the various Rotor research projects that came over a few years after its release), or people who just had that itch to "get wonky with it" and learn how some of the structures worked. Granted, a lot of what those people in the last category learned turned out to be pretty helpful in the Real World, but it was a payoff that came with a pretty non-trivial learning curve.</p> <p>Fast-forward a few years, to the end of calendar year 2005.</p> <p>By this point, .NET 2.0 has been out in production form for a bit, and Mark Lewin, then of Microsoft University Relations (I think that was his job, but to be honest my recollection on that point is kinda fuzzy) approached me: Microsoft was interested in seeing a second edition of the book out, to keep the Rotor community up to date with what was going on in the state of the art in the CLR. Was I interested? Sure, but the rules surrounding a multi-author book and subsequent editions are pretty clear: everybody has to be given right of first refusal. Thus a two-fold task was under way: find a co-author (preferably somebody from the CLR team, since my skills had never really been in navigating the Rotor source code in the first place, and I hadn't really spent a significant amount of time in the code since 2001), and get Geoff and Dave to indicate--in a very proper legal fashion--that they were passing on the second edition.</p> <p>Ugh. Lawyers. Contracts. Bleah.</p> <p>John Osborn then broke the bad news: OReilly wasn't interested in doing a second edition. I couldn't really blame them, since the first hadn't broken any kind of sales record, but I was a bit bummed because I thought this was the end of the road.</p> <p>Mark Lewin to the rescue. Apparently his part of Microsoft <em>really</em> wanted this book out, to the point where they were willing to fund the effort, if I and my co-author were still interested. Sure, that sounded like a workable idea. And once the book was done, maybe we could publish it through MSPress, if that sounded like a good idea to me. Sure, that sounded good. Then Mark dropped the suggestion that maybe I could talk to Joel Pobar, former CLR geek extraordinaire, to see if he was interested. Joel had impressed me back when we'd briefly touched bases during the first book-writing experience, so yeah, sure, that sounded like a good idea. He was on board pretty quickly, and so we had the first step out of the way.</p> <p>Next, we had to get OReilly to release their copyright on the first book, so we (and possibly MSPress) could work on and publish the second edition. This turned out to be a huge part of the time between then and now, not owing to any one party's deliberate attempt to derail the process, but just because copies of contracts had to be sent to the original three authors (myself, Stutz and Geoff) to sign over our rights with OReilly to a Creative Commons License, then copies had to be sent to everybody else so all the signatures could appear on one document, and so on.</p> <p>Did I say it already? Ugh. Lawyers. Contracts. Bleah.</p> <p>Then, we had to get a contract from Microsoft signed, and that meant more contracts flying back and forth across the fax lines, and then later the US (and Australian) postal system, and that was more delays as the same round of signatures had to be exchanged.</p> <p>Just for the record: Ugh. Lawyers. Contracts. Bleah.</p> <p>Finally, though, the die was cast, the authors were ready to go, and.... Hey, does anybody have the latest soft copy of the Word docs we used from the first edition? A quick email to John (Osborn) took longer than we thought, as OReilly tried to find the post-QA docs for us to work from. (I had my own copies, of course, but they were pre-QA, and thus not really what we wanted to start from.) More rounds of emails to try and track those down, so we can get started. Oh, and while we're at it, can we get the figures/graphics, too? They're not in the manuscript directly, so.... Oh, wait, does anybody know how to read .EPS files?</p> <p>Then began the actual writing process, or, to be more precise, the revision process. We decided on a process similar to the way the first book had been written: Joel, being the "subject matter expert", would take a first pass on the text, and sketch in the rough outlines of what needed to be said. I would then take the prose, polish it up (which in many cases didn't require a whole lot of work, Joel being a great writer in his own right) and rearrange sections as necessary to make it flow more easily, as well as flesh out certain sections that didn't require a former position on the CLR team to write. Joel would then have a look at what I wrote, and assuming I didn't get it completely wrong, would sign off on it, and the chapter/section/paragraph/whatever was done.</p> <p>And now we're in the process of doing that cosmetic cleanup that's part of the overtime period in book-writing, including generating the table of contents and index, since, it turns out, we'd rather publish it ourselves than through MSPress (which they're OK with). So, readers will have a choice: get the free download from Microsoft's website (once we're done, which should be "real soon now") and read it in soft-copy, or buy it off of Amazon in "treeware version", which will put a modest amount of money into Joel's and my collective pocket (once the relatively modest expenses of self-publishing are covered, that is).</p> <p>This will be my first experience with self-publishing (as it is for Joel, too), so I'm eager to see how the whole things turns out. One thing I will warn the prospective self-publisher, though: do <em>not</em> underestimate the time you will spend doing those things the editorial/QA/copyedit pass normally handles for you, because it's kind of a pain in the *ss to do it yourself. Still, it's worth it, particularly if you're having a hard time selling your book to a publisher who, for reasons of economy of scale, don't want to publish a niche book (like this one).</p> <p>Anyway, like many of my blog postings, this post has gone on long enough, so I'll sign off here with a "go read the draft", even if you're a Java or other execution engine/virtual machine kind of developer--seeing the nuts and bolts of a complex execution engine in action is a pretty cool exercise.</p> <p>Oh, and if anybody's interested in doing a similar kind of effort around the OpenJDK (once it ships), let me know, 'cuz I'm a glutton for punishment....</p>
