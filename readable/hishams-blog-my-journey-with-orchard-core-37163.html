    <p>It has been a while since I wrote my latest blog post, because my left ankle was broken and did a surgey since then, the thing that let me stay on the bed for around half a year.</p>
<p>Afterward I did some contribution in OSS inluding <a href="https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore">Orchard Core</a> which I spent a lot of time on it with the community.</p>
<h3>Orchard Core RC Release</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this blog post I'm glad to announce that the Orchard Core team will ship the RC release today - align with shipping .NET Core 3.0 release - after three beta releases.</p>
<p>The current release includes many features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content Localization</li>
<li>RTL admin theme</li>
<li>Resources CDN</li>
<li>Media CDN support</li>
<li>GitHub authentication</li>
<li>Facebook applications</li>
<li>.NET Core 3.0</li>
<li>Localization NuGet packages</li>
<li>Azure Media resizing</li>
<li>SQL fields indexing</li>
<li>Full Text aspect</li>
</ul>
<h3>Orchard Core &amp; .NET Core 3.0</h3>
<p>The <strong>BIG</strong> thing in this release that Orchard Core is now targeting <code>netcoreapp3.0</code> after shipping <code>.NET Core 3.0</code> today at <code>.NET Conf 2019</code>.</p>
<p>What that mean? This mean a lot in terms of performance improvement, feature wise such as new routing API and JSON APIs and much more ..</p>
<p>For more detailed information you can read the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0/">Announcing .NET Core 3.0</a>.</p>
<h3>Me &amp; Localization ❤️ Orchard Core RC</h3>
<p>I like working in localization since the <code>DNX</code> days where <code>Microsoft.Extensions.Localization</code> was introduced at the time, and I continue to do localization stuff with many open source projects, so what's new in localization with Orchard Core RC?</p>
<p><strong>1- Content Localization</strong></p>
<p>This release introducing a new <code>OrchardCore.Modules.ContentLocalization</code> module which allow the content author to create multi-lingual content items after enabling the module by the site admin.</p>
<p>This is simply happen by adding a <code>LocalizationPart</code> to any content item in which we need to support localization for that.</p>
<p>Just a little tip, don't be confuse with <code>OrchardCore.Modules.Localization</code> which allow the site to enable the localization feature but not localize the content.</p>
<p><strong>2- RTL admin theme</strong></p>
<p>Finally in this relase the admin site fully support RTL for those language whose language direction is right to left such as Arabic - which is mother language -, Persian and Hebrew.</p>
<p>To support the RTL in the admin theme, you just simply need to enable <code>OrchardCore.Modules.Localization</code> which I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p><strong>3- Localization NuGet packages</strong></p>
<p>Orchard Core translations are using <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/orchard-core">Crowdin</a>  quite often for translating the content for the supported cultures. Last few weeks the Orchard Core team introduced a new set of translations NuGet packages in the <a href="https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Translations">Orchard Translations</a> repository to allow the developers localize thier sites simply by adding NuGet package.</p>
<h3>Working Experience with Orchard Core Community</h3>
<p>Orchard Core community is fablous!! I never ever work with such community in open source project before.</p>
<p>Orchard Core is a huge project - and I'm not aware about the entire project and every module - but the community folks are very active in the Orchard Core repository as well as in gitter, so whenever I have an a question I can file an issue or write it in gitter and I got the answer very quickly.</p>
<p>I'd like to say that I'm glad to work with such teacm &amp; community before and after I join the Orchard Core dev team. There 're many cool guys in the team that I like to thank them for their assistant such as: <a href="https://github.com/sebastienros">Sébastien Ros</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jtkech">Jean-Thierry Kéchichian</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Skrypt">Jasmin Savard</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jptissot">Jean-Philippe Tissot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/deanmarcussen">Dean Marcussen</a> .. etc.</p>
<p>Also there 're many good friends from the community the made me busy with RTL issues :)</p>
<h3>My Contributions</h3>
<p>I was one of the old follower for OrchardCore project since it named <code>Brochard</code>, I'm not sure if I made a PR at that time, but after awhile, why I contribute on <a href="https://github.com/sebastienros/yessql">YesSQL</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/sebastienros/fluid">Fluid</a> projects I saw some activity going on Orchard project at the time I decided to do some contribution.</p>
<p>If I recall almost my contribution are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Localization</li>
<li>Support RTL Admin Theme</li>
<li>Translations Packages</li>
<li>Prettify the Admin User Interface</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lessons to be learned</h3>
<ul>
<li>Priority .. priority .. priority as Seb always said :) , focusing on the issues within milestones that planned by the PM is very important in any OSS instead of picking random once to fix</li>
<li>it's not a matter of writing a fix .. it's a matter of how you write it</li>
<li>Suggest .. share ideas with the team instead of doing it lonely, because we working on open</li>
<li>Write a unit tests whenever it's possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally I enchourge everyone who didn't heard or work with Orchard Core to have a try.</p>
<p>Happy Coding !!</p>
