<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-test-id="comment"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>It used to be assumed that the Romans were simply too "practical" to bother with pure mathematics. The infamous murder of Archimedes by a Roman soldier after the siege of Syracuse has sometimes been taken to epitomize this brutal indifference.</p><p>The truth, of course, is a little more complicated.</p><p>Although there were no really spectacular theoretical advances in the Roman imperial era, there were very gifted mathematicians. The most famous is probably Claudius Ptolemy (fl. 2nd century CE), whose <em>Almagest</em> represented the acme of scientific astronomy until Copernicus. Other important Roman-era mathematicians include Diophantus (the "father of algebra") and Hero (namesake of theorem still taught in high school geometry). There were also very considerable advances in mathematically-informed engineering; the great dome of Justinian's Hagia Sophia was famously designed by the mathematician Anthemius of Tralles (who also, incidentally, invented an "earthquake machine" to irritate his upstairs neighbor). Even the humble art of surveying (of which the Romans were extremely fond) required substantial knowledge of geometry.</p><p>The most important reason for the decline of theoretical mathematics was probably the disappearance of political incentive for "research and development" in this sector. The Ptolemies had sponsored Euclid and other mathematicians working in the Library of Alexandria at least partly as a means of gaining cultural and political capital vis-a-vis the other Hellenistic kingdoms. The great library itself, in fact, owed its existence to the same basic initiative, as did the rival library built by the kings of Pergamum. Once Rome conquered the Mediterranean, royal sponsorship for new research vanished. The great patrons now were wealthy Romans and (above all) the emperors; and these men tended to be interested in the more mainstream disciplines of rhetoric and philosophy. The only academic chairs sponsored by the emperors, in fact, were for rhetoric (in Rome) and philosophy (in Athens). Alexandria remained an important center of mathematical research (Ptolemy, Diophantus, and Hero all worked there), but this seems to have been more a matter of intellectual inertia (and a consequence of the library's resources) than anything else.</p><p>Some sense of the Roman emperors' attitude toward intellectual progress is provided by an anecdote mentioned by both Pliny the Elder and Petronius. To give Petronius' version:</p><p>"There was once a workman who made a glass cup that was unbreakable. So he was given an audience of the Emperor with his invention; he made Caesar give it back to him and then threw it on the floor. Caesar was as frightened as could be. But the man picked up his cup from the ground: it was dented like a bronze bowl; then he took a little hammer out of his pocket and made the cup quite sound again without any trouble. After doing this he thought he had himself seated on the throne of Jupiter, especially when Caesar said to him: 'Does anyone else know how to blow glass like this?' Just see what happened. He said not, and then Caesar had him beheaded. Why? Because if his invention were generally known we should treat gold like dirt. " (Satyricon 51)</p><p>The dubious truth of this story is less important than the fact that it was told: it was assumed (almost certainly correctly) that the emperors were more concerned with maintaining the status quo than with sponsoring an advance. The same reasoning, we may assume, was applied to mathematical research.</p><p>Other reasons might be posited. The Greco-Roman educational system venerated the past, and privileged memorization and rhetorical skill over all other intellectual activity. Hellenistic mathematicians, moreover, may have reached "limits" that their Roman successors could not, without advances in the way mathematics were done, surpass. I think, however, that the lack of political and cultural support for mathematical scholarship was most fundamental.</p></div></div></div></div>
