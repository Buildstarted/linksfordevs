Whilst I was there I ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_sainty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Sainty</a> and we got talking. Chris is something of an expert on Blazor. What’s Blazor, you ask? Well, it’s a Microsoft open source project and part of the open source .NET platform. I’d not previously been aware of it, so I thought I’d sit down with Chris and ask him about it. Here’s our chat (in a fairly windy Norwich):</p><div><p class="readability-styled" style="display: inline;">“It’s been fantastic…the interaction with the team…it’s so cool to actually directly interact with the team that built the project.”</p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-text="&quot;It’s been fantastic…the interaction with the team…it’s so cool to actually...&quot;" data-via="tomorgan" data-size="small" data-count="none">Tweet This</a></span></div><p>I love this sentence from Chris: It’s been fantastic…the interaction with the team…it’s so cool to actually directly interact with the team that built the project. For me, this is the best part of the way that Microsoft interacts with the community today.</p><p>If Blazor&nbsp;sounds as interesting to you as it did to me, then here is how you can learn more:</p><p><a href="https://blazor.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blazor.net</a> – landing page for the Blazor.net project<br><a href="https://chrissainty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chrissainty.com</a> – Chris’ blog, covering lots of howto and samples</p><p>Thanks very much to Chris for giving up his lunchbreak to enable this to happen.</p></div></div></div></div>
