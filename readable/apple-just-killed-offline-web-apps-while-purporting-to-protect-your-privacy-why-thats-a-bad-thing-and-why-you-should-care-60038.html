<h2 id="blocking-third-party-cookies-good-killing-offline-web-apps-bad">Blocking third-party cookies, good. Killing offline web apps, bad.</h2>
<p>On the face of it, WebKit’s announcement yesterday titled <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/">Full Third-Party Cookie Blocking and More</a> sounds like something I would wholeheartedly welcome. Unfortunately, I can’t because the “and more” bit effectively kills off Offline Web Apps and, with it, the chance to have privacy-respecting apps like <a href="https://ar.al/2019/02/01/hypha-spike-multiwriter-2/">the prototype I was exploring earlier in the year</a> based on <a href="https://datproject.org/">DAT</a>.</p>
<p>Block all third-party cookies, yes, by all means<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. But deleting all local storage (including Indexed DB, etc.) after 7 days effectively blocks any future decentralised apps using the browser (client side) as a trusted replication node in a peer-to-peer network. And that’s a huge blow to the future of privacy.</p>
<h2 id="but-apple-cares-about-your-privacy">But Apple cares about your privacy…</h2>
<p>Do they, though?</p>
<p>If they care about your privacy, why is the Apple News app a sewer of surveillance capitalism? If they did care about your privacy, here’s what they’d do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Implement all of the privacy protections they have in Safari in the Apple News app also.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow content blockers like <a href="https://better.fyi/">Better</a> to protect your privacy in Apple News app.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Heck, they could even go further and ban apps from corporations like Facebook, Inc., and Alphabet, Inc., that have violating your privacy as the core tenet of their business model.</p>
<p>Instead, what do they do? They kill offline web apps.</p>
<p>You’d almost think they had an App Store to promote or something.</p>
<h2 id="a-reevaluation">A reevaluation</h2>
<p>In a blog post I wrote at the start of 2015 titled <a href="https://ar.al/notes/apple-vs-google-on-privacy-a-tale-of-absolute-competitive-advantage/">Apple vs Google on privacy: a tale of absolute competitive advantage</a>, I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So riddle me this: if you have an absolute competitive advantage – if you have something that you can do that your competitors cannot – would you throw it away?</p>
<p>Only if you’re an idiot.</p>
<p>And something tells me Tim Cook isn’t an idiot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, I was wrong.</p>

<p>Not that blocking third party cookies is going to kill off surveillance capitalism by any means. Remember that Google is on board with this and plans to implement it themselves by 2022. Which means that by that date they don’t foresee themselves needing third-party cookies to track you. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
