So far, the attacker gained 30,000 EOS worth over $110,000 while&nbsp;making the network “unusable.”</span></p><h2>Scale of the exploit</h2><p><span>A clever attacker was able to use </span><a href="https://eosauthority.com/rex"><span>REX</span></a><span>, an EOS resource exchange for RAM and CPU, to ensure that blocks were filled with their transactions to </span><span>continuously win</span><span> on the gambling dApp EOSPlay. This resulted in the EOSIO network “freezing” as thousands of EOS were fed to the attacker’s wallet, as confirmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/rektkid_/status/1172595110237921281?s=20">another source</a>.</span></p><p><span>For 300 EOS, worth a little over $1,000, the attacker was able to make away with 30,000 EOS tokens, said </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thejaredmoore"><span>Jared Moore</span></a><span> to CryptoSlate, an active community member.

The attacker appears to be leveraging multiple accounts to exploit several different <span class="glossaryTerm" data-title="Smart Contracts" data-content="A&nbsp;digital protocol used to facilitate and enforce the negotiation of a contract without use of a third party." data-url="/glossary/smart-contracts">smart contracts<span class="glossaryBubbleContainer"></span></span>.</p><h2>Mechanics behind the attack</h2><p>As for the method behind the attack,&nbsp;EOSIO Alabama <a href="https://twitter.com/eosioalabama/status/1172757840743870466?s=20">explained</a> that the billing rate for <span class="glossaryTerm" data-title="CPU" data-content="Central computing unit. A generalised processor used as the main ‘brains’ for a computer." data-url="/glossary/cpu">CPU<span class="glossaryBubbleContainer"></span></span> resources dynamically increases on REX.</p><blockquote><p>“Everyone basically gets locked out unless they have more EOS staked than the attacker,” he reasoned.</p></blockquote><p>In this instance, the attacker had roughly 900,000 EOS staked and allocated to <span class="glossaryTerm" data-title="CPU" data-content="Central computing unit. A generalised processor used as the main ‘brains’ for a computer." data-url="/glossary/cpu">CPU<span class="glossaryBubbleContainer"></span></span>, seemingly preventing others from accessing the resource. The anonymous&nbsp;security engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/Dexaran/status/1172664565559189510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1172664565559189510&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptoslate.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D113640%26action%3Dedit">supported</a> this theory, saying that “by congesting the network the attacker disallowed anyone to send transactions because the cost was too high for most users.”</p><p>That same developer stated that his EOS only provided 0.2 percent of the network resources EOSIO would normally divvy-up to stakers, an indicator of how serious the congestion was.</p><p>What’s even more insidious: the owners of the <span class="glossaryTerm" data-title="Smart Contracts" data-content="A&nbsp;digital protocol used to facilitate and enforce the negotiation of a contract without use of a third party." data-url="/glossary/smart-contracts">smart contracts<span class="glossaryBubbleContainer"></span></span> would have difficulty disabling their contracts due to the network congestion and lack of network resources, as described above, said the developer.&nbsp;<span>Until there’s a fork or a patch, the exploit can continue to be abused whenever an EOSIO user spends $1,000 or more on REX, Moore added.&nbsp;</span></p><p>EOSPlay should be avoided until the exploit is fixed. For the rest of the network, people’s funds should not be at risk from the exploit.</p><p><em>Information is being added to this story as things unfold.</em></p><div class="price-watch-coins"><div class="price-watch-coin"><p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/eos/" title="EOS">EOS</a>, currently ranked #7 by market cap, is down <span class="text-number">0.07%</span> over the past 24 hours.
