It was the most extraordinary thing to see.”</p><figure><h2></h2><amp-youtube data-videoid="80BXZfuevkE" layout="responsive" width="480" height="270" class="i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer></i-amphtml-sizer></amp-youtube></figure><p>The documentary makers used spy cameras hidden in fake turtles, fish and squid to film 900 hours of footage showing dolphins in their natural habitats.</p><p>The scenes showing them “using” puffer fish will feature in the second episode of the series, which starts on Thursday.</p><p>It is the latest in a long run of wildlife documentaries made by Downer which use similar spy camera techniques. Previous series include Penguins: Spy in the Huddle, which like the Dolphins programme was narrated by David Tennant, Elephants: Spy in the Herd with David Attenborough and Lions: Spy in the Den.</p><figure><h2></h2><amp-youtube data-videoid="UDtqvYDM41k" layout="responsive" width="480" height="270" class="i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer></i-amphtml-sizer></amp-youtube></figure><p>Downer said: “The spy creatures were designed to infiltrate the dolphins’ hidden lives by looking like the marine creatures a dolphin might encounter in their everyday lives.”</p></div></div></div></div>
