<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I remember being eight or nine years old and wandering around the young adult section, trying to find a good book. I would basically just tilt my head and wander the shelves, reading titles. If something sounded unique or interesting, I’d read the first page. If I liked it, I’d take it home. Deep in the fiction section, I stumbled across a BASIC reference book, obviously not written for children and obviously not fiction. Little did I know, that book would transform the rest of my life.</p>



<p>The internet would drastically change the world, but it wasn’t until 1997 that I got on the internet for the first time via AOL. My parents bought me a Borland C Compiler, and I’d spend the next years learning how to create game engines, smart pointers, efficiently doing matrix multiplication, Dijkstra’s algorithms, rastering, AI, and other fun things. I was never interested in writing an actual game, just the tools to build one.</p>



<p>I didn’t have search like we have today. I didn’t have convenient guides to tell me what to learn in what order. I had to figure it out myself. I explored libraries, read open source code that was shared in forums, and asked many questions.</p>



<p>When Google became a thing, it used to sometimes give completely tangentially related results. It was incredibly awesome to explore these spaces and find new communities to involve myself in. I got in the habit of starting my search from the fifth page, which is where all the good stuff was.</p>



<p>Over time, things became even better. I hardly ever make it to the fifth page anymore. I hardly ever don’t find what I need. I do miss exploring though. I miss learning things that are barely related to what I’m looking for, or just wandering around old Yahoo and finding genuinely interesting things.</p>



<p>Today, our choices are structured by recommendation engines, our scope limited by only what we know to search for and people like us. We no longer have a sense of discovery when trying to find an answer and our scope is incredibly small, driven by what we’ve looked for in the past.</p>
