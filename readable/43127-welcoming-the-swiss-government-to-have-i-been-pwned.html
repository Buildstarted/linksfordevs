There I spent some time with a delegation of the National Cybersecurity Centre discussing the challenges they face and where HIBP can play a role. Continuing the march forward to <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-uk-and-australian-governments-are-now-monitoring-their-gov-domains-on-have-i-been-pwned/">provide governments with better access to their departments' data exposed in breaches</a>, I'm very pleased to welcome Switzerland as the 7th national government onto Have I Been Pwned! They'll join the other govs in Europe and Australia and have complete free and direct API access to all the breached addresses appearing on their government domains.</p><p>I expect to keep on-boarding further governments in the months to come but for now, it's a big welcome to <a href="https://www.isb.admin.ch/">Switzerland's National Cybersecurity Centre</a>!</p><section class="article-open_tag"><a class="tag" href="/tag/have-i-been-pwned-3f/">Have I Been Pwned</a><a class="tag" href="/tag/government/">Government</a></section></div></div></div></div>
