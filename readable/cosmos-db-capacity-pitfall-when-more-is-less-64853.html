    <p>You can use Cosmos DB to
<a href="https://mijailovic.net/2020/03/28/azure-money-burning/">burn money</a>,
but you can also use it as a database. Cosmos DB is horizontally scalable,
which means that you can always increase the capacity of the system on the fly,
as long as you <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partition-data">partition your data</a> well enough. Here is what Cosmos DB
documentation says about <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partitioning-overview#choose-partitionkey">choosing a good partition key</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you choose a partition key that evenly distributes
throughput consumption across logical partitions, you
will ensure that throughput consumption across physical
partitions is balanced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is solid advice, but it’s not sufficient to ensure the optimal
usage of provisioned capacity (even if you have perfectly balanced logical
partitions). In this post, I’ll show you one counterintuitive scenario
where even after making all the right design choices, provisioning <em>more</em>
capacity can lead to <em>less</em> throughput consumption, and even throttling.</p>

<h2 id="experiment">Experiment</h2>

<p>Let’s say that you have designed the following system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have 1,000,000 users.</li>
  <li>Users are stored in database <code>db</code> and container <code>users</code>.</li>
  <li>Users are partitioned by unique <code>userId</code> property.</li>
  <li>Traffic is uniformly distributed between all users.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the surface, this seems like a good design:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have wide range of possible partition key values.</li>
  <li>Each user belongs to its own logical partition.</li>
  <li>Throughput consumption is evenly distributed across logical partitions.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these properties together should guarantee that throughput is equally
distributed across physical partitions. Let’s see if that’s true.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3/tree/master/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Tools/Benchmark">Cosmos DB .NET benchmark tool</a> to simulate this system
(the tool is a hidden gem of Cosmos DB ecosystem, and I can’t recommend
it enough). But you can’t use it out of the box. I had to make two
changes in the code to make it work in this specific scenario:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Randomly generate the partition key by choosing a number between 0 and 1,000,000</li>
  <li>Apply rate limiting to outgoing Cosmos DB requests to keep the load at the same level</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s begin the simulation by provisioning 18,000 RU/s on the <code>users</code>
container. After running the tool for a few times with the different
load, you figure out that 1,300 requests per second will consume all
available throughput:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>dotnet run CosmosBenchmark.csproj <span></span>
  <span>-e</span> <span>$ACCOUNT_ENDPOINT</span>  <span></span>
  <span>-k</span> <span>$ACCOUNT_KEY</span> <span></span>
  <span>--database</span> db <span></span>
  <span>--container</span> <span>users</span> <span></span>
  <span>-w</span> InsertV2BenchmarkOperation <span></span>
  <span>-n</span> 1000000 <span></span>
  <span>--partitionkeypath</span> /userId <span></span>
  <span>--pl</span> 100 <span></span>
  <span>--rps</span> 1300
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s imagine you are expecting that users will start using
your system more, so you preventively increase container’s throughput
to 21,000 RU/s. You think that this change should not make any visible
difference under the same load (higher throughput should only ensure
that the system can handle more traffic in the future). But you run the
tool again (with the same parameters), and you see some very confusing
results:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>18,000 RU/s</th>
      <th>21,000 RU/s</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Total</strong></td>
      <td>1,000,000</td>
      <td>1,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Success</strong></td>
      <td>1,000,000</td>
      <td>946,881</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Fail</strong></td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>53,119</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>RPs</strong></td>
      <td>1,284</td>
      <td>1,286</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>RUps</strong></td>
      <td>17,854</td>
      <td>16,928</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In both cases, you applied the same load (slightly below 1,300 requests
per second). But after you provisioned <em>more</em> RUs, you consumed <em>less</em>
of them. Not only that, but more than 5% of all requests were unexpectedly
throttled. You can clearly see the difference between two runs in this
Azure Monitor chart:</p>

<p><img src="https://mijailovic.net/assets/img/2020-07-25-total-requests.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="what-is-going-on-here">What is going on here?</h2>

<p>Cosmos DB <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partition-data">partitioning documentation</a> says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike logical partitions, physical partitions are an internal implementation
of the system and they are entirely managed by Azure Cosmos DB.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, even though Cosmos DB tries to hide its implementation
details, sometimes you will need to know what is going on behind the
scene. I’ll use the results of the previous experiment to show you why.</p>

<p>Container with 18,000 RU/s will most likely have two physical partitions
(it can actually have more, but I’m ignoring these cases because they are
not relevant for this discussion). Each of the partitions will handle
roughly one half of the traffic (500,000 users and 9,000 RU/s):</p>

<p><img src="https://mijailovic.net/assets/img/2020-07-25-p0-p1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>What happens when you provision 21,000 RU/s? Two physical partitions
will no longer be enough to satisfy the increased throughput, since
each physical partition is limited to serving at most 10,000 RU/s.
Cosmos DB will create a new physical partition, and it will do that
by splitting one of the existing partitions in two. The traffic
between physical partitions will now be distributed like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mijailovic.net/assets/img/2020-07-25-p0-p1-p2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Cosmos DB will not redistribute logical keys across all partitions,
so one of the original partitions will remain as twice as big as two
new ones (this applies to both throughput and storage).</p>

<p>Even though nothing looks wrong in this picture (at least on the surface),
now you actually have a capacity problem. Because container throughput
is divided equally among partitions, each partition can now serve only
up to 7,000 RU/s. But the first partition is still getting the same
traffic (9,000 RU/s), which of course leads to throttling (this seems
obvious now). Again, you can see this clearly in the throughput metrics
section in the Azure portal (try to see the barely visible dark blue
line at 7K, which shows the per-partition usage limit):</p>

<p><img src="https://mijailovic.net/assets/img/2020-07-25-partition-key-ranges.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="what-can-you-do-about-this">What can you do about this?</h2>

<p>When you see throttling, your immediate reaction might be to provision
more RUs. That will of course help, but it will also lead to spending
much more money then you really need to. A better way to handle the
problem of imbalanced physical partitions is actually pretty simple:
when current number of physical partitions is not enough to handle
the new throughput, always split <em>all</em> physical partitions (this will
only help you when your logical keys are already evenly distributed,
but not when you have a hot logical partition).</p>

<p>First, you have to know when increasing the throughput will create
new physical partitions. Azure portal is nice enough to give you
this warning when the partition split is about to happen:</p>

<p><img src="https://mijailovic.net/assets/img/2020-07-25-new-partitions.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Second, you have to figure out the current number of partitions
in the container. You can do that by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cosmos-db/get-partition-key-ranges">REST API</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/cosmosdb/sql/container?view=azure-cli-latest#az-cosmosdb-sql-container-show">Azure CLI</a>,
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.documents.client.documentclient.readpartitionkeyrangefeedasync">C# SDK</a>, or any other Azure Cosmos DB client that supports retrieving
all partition key ranges for a given container.</p>

<p>The third and the final step is to provision enough RUs so that all
physical partitions will be split (after this operation completes,
you can immediately lower the throughput to the value you actually
want to use). You can use the following formula to calculate the
needed throughput:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>2 * number of partitions * 10,000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For example, if you have a container with 300,000 RU/s in 35 physical
partitions, and you want to increase the throughput to 380,000 RU/s,
you will have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provision 700,000 RU/s</li>
  <li>Wait until the operation finishes</li>
  <li>Decrease the throughput to 380,000 RU/s</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all! If this helps to you reduce your Cosmos DB monthly bill,
feel free to send me thank you notes in the form of US dollars!</p>
