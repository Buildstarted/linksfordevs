          <p>My team has hit this with every project as well, and we've had to alter every <code>global.json</code> in every repo for everyone that upgraded. It's not an awesome experience.</p>
<p>We have/had a <code>global.json</code> like so (in dozens of repos) like so:</p>
<div><pre>{
  <span><span>"</span>sdk<span>"</span></span>: {
    <span><span>"</span>version<span>"</span></span>: <span><span>"</span>3.0.100<span>"</span></span>
  }
}</pre></div>
<p>...to which we had to add <code>"rollForward": "latestMajor"</code>. While it's great there's a mechanism for this, the experience on upgrading is really crappy for developers. The VS installer leaves the <code>C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\3.0.100</code> directory in place, so <strong>it's a broken SDK</strong>. e.g. this is what you got at the console after the VS upgrade:</p>
<pre><code>Î» dotnet --version
Found .NET Core SDK, but did not find dotnet.dll at [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\3.0.100\dotnet.dll]
</code></pre>
<p>...that's a very confusing experience (and I'm hoping a bug - but I've hit this several times in upgrades now). Half of this is because it was removed, but it wasn't totally removed and since SDK version detection works on "is the folder there?", Visual Studio breaks pretty bad here and I've gotten a lot of requests for help from devs across the company on this. Here's their experience after the upgrade to 16.4:</p>

<p>After they close that...</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/454813/70862856-bcc1a800-1f0f-11ea-8bac-4aaabe3c659d.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/454813/70862856-bcc1a800-1f0f-11ea-8bac-4aaabe3c659d.png" alt="Visual Studio"></a></p>
<p>I was a fan of the VS installer removing all of the <em>preview</em> releases when this was pitched. Huge fan. I racked up many gigs on SDKs. But in practice, this has caused more pain than it removed. I ask this: <strong>Can we please only uninstall/cleanup the same minor version?</strong></p>
<p>Without that scope, I have to either go re-install the SDK (which really defeats the purpose here), or go change the <code>global.json</code> in every repo. Neither of those are good for me or my team, and this cleanup feature becomes a burden rather than a help.</p>
<hr>
<p>If anyone wants to repro the user experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a specific version of an SDK not installed in your <code>global.json</code> (with no roll forward), e.g. <code>3.0.100</code></li>
<li>Create that empty directory, e.g. on Windows <code>C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\3.0.100</code></li>
<li>Try and open the solution<br>
...and you'll get the behavior in the screenshots above. This is unfortunately what the VS install experience does by default - hoping we can improve that!</li>
</ol>
