    <div class="c-downloads"> <div class="c-series"> <p class="c-series__description">Perhaps you want to make games, create animations, or VFX for film. Perhaps you want to create concept art, or simply create for your own pleasure. Whether you&apos;re working with 2D or 3D art, it&apos;s important to have a grounding in the rules and basic techniques. With that in mind, we asked Derek Stevens to create a series that anyone can follow. Our goal is to help you see the world, both inner and outer, by the rules of art. Over the course of the next two hours, Derek will demonstrate bringing your visions to life. From simple shapes to still life and perspective, all you have to do is follow the rules. And of course, remember how to get to Carnegie Hall. Practice, practice, practice!</p> </div> <div class="c-series"> <p class="c-series__description">In this series, Steve Curtis is going to demonstrate how to harness the power of Photoshop to get beautiful 2D art work for games, even if you&#x2019;ve never created art before. This is High-Rez art designed to look like modern graphics but with that old school feel. Although it isn&#x2019;t pixel art, the graphics created could certainly be sized down to create art that has that pixel art feel. This course uses Photoshop, however GIMP and similar programs should suffice. No tablet is required, all of the art in this series was created using only a mouse. We will create beautiful cartoon art with a modern edge, and harness light and shading techniques to give our work depth.</p> <ol> <li><a href="https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/3dbuzz/videos/2d-game-art-for-nonartists-part-01.zip">2d-game-art-for-nonartists-part-01.zip</a></li> </ol> </div> <div class="c-series"> <p class="c-series__description">The Legacy Series is an archive of older videos created as free content from throughout the history of 3D Buzz.

If you want to see the development of a completed project working seamlessly with socket.io, nodejs, Reactive Extensions, WebPack (and more!), then this is the course for you! We not only have a focus on our build pipeline - both development and production - but also on creating an architecture that takes advantage of the reactive programming paradigm. It&apos;s impossible to classify this course as a tour of any particular component, since, as you know, real applications are much more complicated than that. But rest assured that we leave no stone unturned as we explore how each component can work seamlessly together.
