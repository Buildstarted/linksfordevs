We’ve been working with Xiaomi and we’re comfortable that the issue was limited to their camera technology platform. While we worked on this issue with Xiaomi, we made the decision to disable all Xiaomi integrations on our devices. We understand this had a significant impact on users of Xiaomi devices but the security and privacy of our users is our priority and we felt this was the appropriate action.&nbsp;</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We’re re-enabling Xiaomi device integrations for everything but camera streaming after necessary testing has been completed. We will not reinstate camera functionality for Xiaomi devices until we are confident that the issue has been fully resolved. We’ll keep you updated with information as more becomes available to share.&nbsp;</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thanks,&nbsp;</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Rachel</p></div></div></div></div>
