Ngo was later physically attacked by protesters and hospitalized.</span><span class="media-credit">Moriah Ratner/Getty Images</span></p></div> <p>A right-wing meme was born this weekend after Portland police said they&#x2019;d been informed that Antifa protesters had pelted far-right demonstrators with cement milkshakes. Conservative internet trolls, including Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and writer Ian Miles Cheong, pounced, tweeting that left-wingers were pelting people with cement drinks. Their followers ran with it, <a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1145375809542246405">posting photos of concrete burns suffered by the demonstrators.</a></p>
<p>Except that none of it was true. There&#x2019;s no evidence that the milkshakes contained cement. The photos were fake. And the police got it all wrong, and in the process birthed a right-wing internet movement based on a falsehood.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s what actually happened: The Proud Boys, a neo-fascist group, held a rally in Portland on Saturday. Protesters aligned with Antifa, the anti-fascist movement, showed up, and some of them sold vegan milkshakes to other protesters. Throwing milkshakes, or &#x201C;milkshaking,&#x201D; has become a left-wing protest tactic, <a href="https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/mb83p3/what-is-milkshaking-its-the-reason-nigel-farage-got-covered-in-mushy-dairy">aimed at embarrassing the far right</a>,&#xA0;and some of the protesters proceeded to pelt Proud Boy demonstrators with their drinks, according to reports.</p>
<p>No one seems to have actually been burned by concrete&#x2014;at least no one reported evidence of it to law enforcement. So where did this idea come from? It started with a tweet from the Portland Police Bureau on Saturday, stating that it had &#x201C;received information that some of the milkshakes thrown&#x2026;contained quick-drying cement.&#x201D; The police later told <em>Willamette Week</em> reporter Katie Shepherd that an officer at the protests had thought he noticed quick-drying cement on a milkshake cup, prompting the <a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1145375356142141442">tweet</a>.<a href="#correction">*</a> The police subsequently received an anonymous email claiming that Quick Rete Cement Mix had been added to the milkshakes,&#xA0;the bureau told Shepard.</p>
<p>Headlines in conservative media outlets highlighted the allegedly violent tactics of the milkshake-throwers. &#x201C;Antifa, conservative protests turn violent as demonstrators throw milkshakes of quick-dry cement at police and onlookers,&#x201D; Fox News reported Saturday. (It has since removed the mention of cement from the headline and rewritten its story to include less definitive language about the cement milkshakes.) &#x201C;Conservative Journalist Andy Ngo Beaten Up and Hit With Cement,&#x201D; read the headline of&#xA0;the conservative website <em>PJ Media</em>. &#xA0;</p>
<p>The stories spurred rage online against Antifa on the basis of something that very likely never happened. Misinformation spiraled further as one troll <a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1145375809542246405">posted fake pictures</a> about concrete burn victims on Twitter. The episode allowed the Proud Boys and their far-right allies to try to reverse the narrative and score sympathy points, instead of being chastised for their racism and support of fascism.</p>
<p>After the police tweet about the cement milkshakes, someone anonymously emailed&#xA0;the police department that &#x201C;the recipe to the milkshakes used today is: -Soymilk &#x2013; Quick Rete Cement Mix &#x2013; Other Chemical Additives to cause long term injury and burns.&#x201D; The sender added, &#x201C;We hope the piggie officers and proud boys enjoyed the shake back!&#x201D;</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s unclear who the emailer was or what motivated him or her. But regardless, the impact was that misinformation was laundered through the police.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Antifa and the Proud Boys all utilize social media to push their stories and narratives upstream,&#x201D; says Ben Decker, who runs the media and tech investigations consultancy Memetica and was previously an internet extremism researcher at Harvard&#x2019;s Shorenstein Center. &#x201C;They use any means, whether it&#x2019;s a Twitter verified blue tick or a trusted media institution to do that.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
<p>Decker adds, &#x201C;The idea of this op was to gaslight and attack Antifa. More negative posts about Antifa make it easier to find negative information about Antifa, true or not.&#x201D; The allegations of cement,&#xA0;he says,&#xA0;made the incident&#xA0;appear far more serious and helped push it across the internet in order to paint Antifa in a negative light.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, one of the top Google search results for &#x201C;cement milkshake&#x201D; was a <em>PJ Media</em> story with the headline &#x201C;Conservative Journalist Andy Ngo Beaten Up and Hit With Cement.&#x201D;&#xA0;That story appeared higher in the results than&#xA0;a <em>Portland Mercury</em> newspaper story with the headline &#x201C;Portland Police Offer No Proof That Protesters Had Milkshakes with Cement.&#x201D; Though the results now show the <em>Portland Mercury</em> story as the top result, for much of the weekend, stories from <em>PJ Media</em>, Fox News, and others claiming that the milkshakes had cement showed up as the top results.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That type of Google bomb,&#x201D; says Decker, &#x201C;is the goal.&#x201D;</p>
