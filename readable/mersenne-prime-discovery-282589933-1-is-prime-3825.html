<h2>
<a href="http://www.mersenne.org/">GIMPS</a> Discovers<br>
Largest Known Prime Number: 2<span size="4"><sup>82,589,933</sup></span>-1</h2>

<p><b>BLOWING ROCK, NC, December 21, 2018</b> -- The
<a href="https://mersenne.org/">Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)</a> has discovered the
largest known prime number, 2<sup>82,589,933</sup>-1, having
<a href="https://www.mersenne.org/primes/digits/M82589933.zip">24,862,048
digits</a>.  A computer volunteered by Patrick Laroche made the find on
December 7, 2018.  Patrick is one of thousands of volunteers using
free GIMPS software available at <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download/">www.mersenne.org/download/</a>.</p>

<p>The new prime number, also known as M82589933, is calculated by multiplying 
together 82,589,933 twos, and then subtracting one. It is more than one and a half million digits larger than
the <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/primes/?press=M77232917">previous record prime number</a>, 
in a special class of extremely rare prime numbers known as Mersenne primes.
It is only the 51st known Mersenne prime ever discovered, each increasingly 
more difficult to find.  Mersenne primes were named for the French monk
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Mersenne.html">Marin Mersenne</a>,
who studied these numbers more than 350 years ago.  GIMPS, founded in 1996, has discovered 
the last 17 Mersenne primes.
Volunteers <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download/">download a free program</a> to search for these primes, with a cash
award offered to anyone lucky enough to find a new prime.
Prof. Chris Caldwell maintains an authoritative web site on 
<a href="https://www.utm.edu/research/primes/largest.html">the largest known primes</a>,
and has an excellent <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/index.html">history of Mersenne primes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A Lucky Find in a Lucky Streak</strong></p>

<p>Patrick Laroche is a 35 year old I.T. professional living in Ocala, Florida.  For many years, Patrick had used GIMPS software as a free
"stress test" for his computer builds.  Recently, he started prime hunting on his media server to "give back" to the project.
After less than 4 months and on just his fourth try, he discovered the new prime number.  By way of comparison, some GIMPS participants
have searched for more than 20 years with tens of thousands of attempts but no success.  Thus proving that even the "little guy"
can compete against those with lots of computing resources.</p>

<p>GIMPS has also been extremely lucky over the last 15 years.  This is GIMPS' 12th prime discovery
between 2<span size="4"><sup>20000000</sup></span>-1 and 2<span size="4"><sup>85000000</sup></span>-1, 
triple the expected number of new primes.  One reason to search for new primes is to match actual results with expected results.
This anomaly is not necessarily evidence that existing theories on the
<a href="https://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/heuristic.html">distribution of Mersenne primes</a> is incorrect.
However, if the trend continues it may be worth further investigation.
</p>

<p><strong>Details on the Discovery and Verification</strong></p>

<p>The primality proof took twelve days of non-stop computing on a machine with an Intel i5-4590T CPU.
To prove there were no errors in the prime discovery process, the new prime was independently verified
using three different programs on three different hardware configurations.
</p><ul>
<li>Andreas Höglund verified the prime using <a href="https://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=16142">CUDALucas</a> 
running on a NVidia V100 GPU in 21 hours.</li>
<li>Andreas Höglund also verified the prime using <a href="https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html">Mlucas</a>
running on 16 cores of an Amazon AWS instance in 72 hours.</li>
<li>Aaron Blosser also verified it using <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download/">Prime95</a> on an Intel 7700K processor in 6 days, 8 hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>GIMPS Prime95 client software was developed by founder George Woltman.
Aaron Blosser is the system administrator, upgrading and maintaining the PrimeNet server as needed.
Volunteers have a chance to earn <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/legal/#awards">research discovery awards of $3,000 or $50,000</a>
if their computer discovers a new Mersenne prime.  GIMPS' next major goal is to win the
<a href="https://www.eff.org/awards/coop-prime-info.php">$150,000 award
administered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> offered
for finding a 100 million digit prime number.</p>

<p>Credit for this prime goes not only to Patrick Laroche for
   running the Prime95 software, Woltman for writing the software, Blosser for maintaining
   the Primenet server, but also the thousands of GIMPS volunteers that sifted through millions of non-prime candidates.&nbsp; 
In recognition of all the above people, official credit for this discovery goes
to "P. Laroche, G. Woltman, A. Blosser, et al."</p>

<p>Patrick's find is eligible for the $3,000 GIMPS research discovery award.</p>



<p><strong>About Mersenne.org's Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search</strong>
</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/">Great Internet Mersenne
Prime Search (GIMPS)</a> was formed in January 1996 by George Woltman to
discover new world record size Mersenne primes. In 1997 Scott Kurowski enabled GIMPS 
to automatically harness the power of thousands of ordinary computers to search for these "needles in a
haystack".  Most GIMPS members join the search for the thrill of possibly
discovering a record-setting, rare, and historic new Mersenne prime.
The search for more Mersenne primes is already under way. There may be
smaller, as yet undiscovered Mersenne primes, and there almost certainly are larger
Mersenne primes waiting to be found.  Anyone with a reasonably powerful PC
can join GIMPS and become a big prime hunter, and possibly earn a cash research 
discovery award.  All the necessary software
can be downloaded for free at <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download/">www.mersenne.org/download/</a>.
GIMPS is organized as Mersenne Research, Inc., a 501(c)(3) science research 
charity. Additional information may be found at

<p><strong>For More Information on Mersenne Primes</strong></p>

<p>Prime numbers have long fascinated both amateur and professional mathematicians. 
An integer greater than one is called a prime number if its only divisors are 
one and itself. The first prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. For example, 
the number 10 is not prime because it is divisible by 2 and 5.
A Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form 2<sup>P</sup>-1.
The first Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, and 127 corresponding to
P = 2, 3, 5, and 7 respectively. There are now 51 known Mersenne primes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.utm.edu/research/primes/mersenne.shtml">Mersenne 
primes</a> have been central to number theory since they were first discussed by 
Euclid about 350 BC. The man whose name they now bear, the French monk <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Mersenne.html">Marin Mersenne</a> (1588-1648),
made a famous conjecture on which values of P would 
yield a prime. It took 300 years and several important discoveries in 
mathematics to settle his conjecture.</p>

<p>At present there are few practical uses for this new large prime,
prompting some to ask "why search for these large primes"?  Those
same doubts existed a few decades ago until important cryptography
algorithms were developed based on prime numbers.  For seven more
good reasons to search for large prime numbers, <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/notes/faq/why.html">see here.</a>

<p>Euclid proved that every Mersenne prime generates a perfect number. A perfect 
number is one whose proper divisors add up to the number itself. The smallest 
perfect number is 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 and the second perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 
+ 7 + 14. Euler (1707-1783) proved that all even perfect numbers come from 
Mersenne primes. The newly discovered perfect number is 2<sup>82,589,932</sup> x (2<sup>82,589,933</sup>-1). This
number is over <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/primes/perfect/perfect82589933.zip">49 million digits</a> long! 
It is still unknown if any odd perfect numbers exist.</p>


<p>There is a unique history to the arithmetic algorithms underlying the GIMPS 
project. The programs that found the recent big Mersenne primes are based on a 
special algorithm. In the early 1990's, the late
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Crandall">Richard Crandall</a>, Apple Distinguished 
Scientist, discovered ways to double the speed of what are called convolutions 
-- essentially big multiplication operations. The method is applicable not
only to prime searching but other aspects of computation.  During that work
he also patented the Fast Elliptic Encryption system, now owned by
Apple Computer, which uses Mersenne primes to quickly encrypt and decrypt
messages.  George Woltman implemented Crandall's algorithm in assembly
language, thereby producing a prime-search program of unprecedented
efficiency, and that work led to the successful GIMPS project.</p>

<p>School teachers from elementary through high-school grades have used
GIMPS to get their students excited about mathematics.  Students who run the
free software are contributing to mathematical research.</p>
