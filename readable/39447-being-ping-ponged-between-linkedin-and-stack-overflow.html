    <h1>Being ping-ponged between LinkedIn and Stack Overflow</h1>
    <div><div class="post-text"> <p>I&apos;m truly sorry this happened to you, but unfortunately, this is on LinkedIn, and we can do little to help.</p> <p>We have extensive guidance on which questions you can ask here, and how companies can support their product here. The ones applicable to this situation are:</p> <p>These kind of support questions are just not acceptable on Stack Overflow, and that&apos;s not going to change. Anything that can&apos;t be answered by a person knowledgeable in the subject, but not employed at LinkedIn is not a good question here.</p> <p>Apparently, this is a longstanding issue, and the text you got is very similar to the one quoted in <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/278748/7296893">LinkedIn directing people to SO?</a> (asked in 2014), and there&apos;s been <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/281019/7296893">a call to reach out to LinkedIn</a> back in 2014 too.</p> <p>You can try linking them this question and answer, and hope they change their ways. We can also hope a community manager at Stack Overflow picks up on this issue, and has a talk with LinkedIn about our rules. But we can&apos;t just reopen your question and hope it gets answered, because that would open the flood gates for other companies to redirect their customer support to Stack Overflow.</p> <p>If you want to be sure this gets picked up by the community team at Stack Overflow, you can contact them via <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/contact">https://stackoverflow.com/contact</a>, as linked in <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/255746">Why can&apos;t I ask customer service-related questions?</a>. Note that this sometimes has a substantial waiting time.</p> </div></div>
