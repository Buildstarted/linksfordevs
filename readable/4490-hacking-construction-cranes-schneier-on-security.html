In the different attack classes that we've outlined, we were able to perform the attacks quickly and even switch on the controlled machine despite an operator's having issued an emergency stop (e-stop).

</p><p>The core of the problem lies in how, instead of depending on wireless, standard technologies, these industrial remote controllers rely on proprietary RF protocols, which are decades old and are primarily focused on <i>safety</i> at the expense of <i>security</i>. It wasn't until the arrival of Industry 4.0, as well as the continuing adoption of the <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/industrial-internet-of-things-iiot">industrial internet of things (IIoT)</a>, that industries began to acknowledge the pressing need for security.</p></div></div></div></div>
