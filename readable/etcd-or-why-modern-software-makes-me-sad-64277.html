		<div><p><img alt="etcd icon" src="https://www.roguelazer.com/images/etcd-icon.png"></p>
<p>Once upon a time in 2013, there was a tool called <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> which was a really lightweight database written
around the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/raft-atc14">Raft</a> consensus algorithm. This tool was
originally written in 2013 for a <del>bullshit</del> unsuccessful project called <a href="https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/">CoreOS Container Linux</a> that was
EOL'd several years ago, but that doesn't really matter — etcd was greater than its original use-case. Etcd
provided a convenient and simple set of primitives (set a key, get a key, set-only-if-unchanged, watch-for-changes) with
a drop-dead simple HTTP API on top of them. I have built a number of tools using etcd as a lightweight consensus store
behind them and it's absolutely a pleasure to work with.</p>
<p>In 2015, an unrelated tool called <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> was released by Google (but, really, by
Xooglers). I would go so far as to say that Kubernetes (or, as the "cool kids" say, <kbd>k8s</kbd>) is the worst thing to happen to system administration
since <a href="https://www.roguelazer.com/2020/03/systemd/">systemd</a>. It's a comprehensive suite that promises to simplify operating clusters of software and give something like 
the experience of Google's <kbd>borg</kbd> cluster manager. What it really does is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add hundreds of new failure modes to your software</li>
<li>Move you from writing portable software configuration to writing thousands of lines of k8s-specific YAML</li>
<li>Ensnare you in a mesh of questionably-good<sup id="fnref:questionably-good"><a href="#fn:questionably-good">1</a></sup> patterns like containerization and software defined networking</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are running a truly enormous system and want to have off-the-shelf orchestration for it, Kubernetes may be
the tool for you. For 99.9% of people out there, it's just an extra layer of complexity that adds almost nothing of
value.</p>
<p>I digress, though; this is a story about etcd. And, unfortunately, our stories come together because Kubernetes was
quickly changed to use etcd as its state store. Thus began the rapid decline of etcd.</p>
<p>With the massive influx of Kubernetes users came, of course, a large number of Xooglers who decided to infect etcd with
Google technologies, as is their way<sup id="fnref:infection"><a href="#fn:infection">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:who"><a href="#fn:who">3</a></sup>. Etcd's simple HTTP API was replaced by a "gRPC"<sup id="fnref:grpc"><a href="#fn:grpc">4</a></sup> version; the
simple internal data model was replaced by a dense and non-orthogonal data model with different types for leases, locks,
transactions, and plain-old-keys. etcd 3.2 added back a tiny subset of the HTTP API through the <a href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/dev-guide/api_grpc_gateway/">"gRPC
Gateway"</a>, but not enough to implement
any of the rich applications built on top of the original API. The v2 API lives on for now, but upstream threatens to
remove it in every new version and there will surely come a time when it'll be removed entirely.</p>
<p>That's it. That's the story. Popular modern technology is taken over by expats from a megacorp and made worse in the
service of a hyper-specialized (and just plain over-hyped) orchestration platform. That's the world today. Anything that
has a simple and elegant feature-set ends up coöpted by people who just want to build big ungainly architecture and ends
up inheriting features from whatever megacorp the coöpters came from<sup id="fnref:megacorp"><a href="#fn:megacorp">9</a></sup>. The software development world would
prefer to use their multi-gigabyte IDEs running on ElectronJS to build thousand-dependency Java applications targeting
ungainly APIs on hard-to-operate systems than support something simpler and better. Quality is, alas, a dying art.</p>
