This type-checking can tell us about errors like typos and values that are potentially <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> before we even run our code. More than just that, that same type analysis can be used to provide a solid editing experience for both TypeScript <em>and</em> JavaScript, powering operations like code completion, find-all-references, quick fixes, and refactorings. In fact, if you’re already using JavaScript in an editor like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, your editing experience is really being powered by TypeScript! So if you’re interested in learning more, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">head over to our website</a>.</p><p>If you’re already ready to use TypeScript, you can get it <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">through NuGet</a>, or use npm with the following command:</p><p>You can also get editor support by</p><ul><li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TypeScriptTeam.typescript-382" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Downloading for Visual Studio 2019/2017</a></li><li>Following <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling#_using-newer-typescript-versions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">instructions for the latest Visual Studio Code</a>.</li><li><a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/TypeScript" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sublime Text 3 via PackageControl</a>.</li></ul><p>TypeScript 3.8 brings a lot of new features, including new or upcoming ECMAScript standards features, new syntax for importing/exporting only types, and more.</p><ul><li><a href="#type-only-imports-exports">Type-Only Imports and Exports</a></li><li><a href="#ecmascript-private-fields">ECMAScript Private Fields</a></li><li><a href="#export-star-as-namespace-syntax"><code>export * as ns</code> Syntax</a></li><li><a href="#top-level-await">Top-Level <code>await</code></a></li><li><a href="#jsdoc-modifiers">JSDoc Property Modifiers</a></li><li><a href="#better-directory-watching">Better Directory Watching on Linux and <code>watchOptions</code></a></li><li><a href="#assume-direct-dependencies">“Fast and Loose” Incremental Checking</a></li><li>Editor Features<ul><li><a href="#convert-to-template-string">Convert to Template String</a></li><li><a href="#call-hierarchy">Call Hierarchy</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</a></li></ul><h2><span id="type-only-imports-exports">Type-Only Imports and Exports</span></h2><p>This feature is something most users may never have to think about; however, if you’ve hit issues here, it might be of interest (especially when compiling under <code>--isolatedModules</code>, our <code>transpileModule</code> API, or Babel).</p><p>TypeScript reuses JavaScript’s import syntax in order to let us reference types. For instance, in the following example, we’re able to import <code>doThing</code> which is a JavaScript value along with <code>Options</code> which is purely a TypeScript type.</p><div><pre><span>// ./foo.ts</span>
<span>interface</span> <span>Options</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>doThing</span><span>(</span><span>options</span>: <span>Options</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// ./bar.ts</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>doThing</span><span>,</span> <span>Options</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./foo.js"</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>doThingBetter</span><span>(</span><span>options</span>: <span>Options</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// do something twice as good</span>
    <span>doThing</span><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>doThing</span><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div><p>This is convenient because <em>most of the time</em> we don’t have to worry about what’s being imported – just that we’re importing <em>something</em>.</p><p>Unfortunately, this only worked because of a feature called <em>import elision</em>. When TypeScript outputs JavaScript files, it sees that <code>Options</code> is only used as a type, and it automatically drops its import. The resulting output looks kind of like this:</p><div><pre><span>// ./foo.js</span>
<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>doThing</span><span>(</span><span>options</span>: <span>Options</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// ./bar.js</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>doThing</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./foo.js"</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>doThingBetter</span><span>(</span><span>options</span>: <span>Options</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// do something twice as good</span>
    <span>doThing</span><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>doThing</span><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div><p>Again, this behavior is usually great, but it causes some other problems.</p><p>First of all, there are some places where it’s ambiguous whether a value or a type is being exported. For example, in the following example is <code>MyThing</code> a value or a type?</p><div><pre><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>MyThing</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./some-module.js"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>{</span> <span>MyThing</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>Limiting ourselves to just this file, there’s no way to know. Both Babel and TypeScript’s <code>transpileModule</code> API will emit code that doesn’t work correctly if <code>MyThing</code> is only a type, and TypeScript’s <code>isolatedModules</code> flag will warn us that it’ll be a problem. The real problem here is that there’s no way to say “no, no, I really only meant the type – this should be erased”, so import elision isn’t good enough.</p><p>The other issue was that TypeScript’s import elision would get rid of import statements that <em>only</em> contained imports used as types. That caused observably different behavior for modules that have side-effects, and so users would have to insert a <em>second</em> import statement purely to ensure side-effects.</p><div><pre><span>// This statement will get erased because of import elision.</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>SomeTypeFoo</span><span>,</span> <span>SomeOtherTypeBar</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./module-with-side-effects"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// This statement always sticks around.</span>
<span>import</span> <span>"./module-with-side-effects"</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>A concrete place where we saw this coming up was in frameworks like Angular.js (1.x) where <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">services</a> needed to be registered globally (which is a side-effect), but where those services were only <code>import</code>ed for types.</p><div><pre><span>// ./service.ts</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Service</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>register</span><span>(</span><span>"globalServiceId"</span><span>,</span> <span>Service</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>// ./consumer.ts</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>Service</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./service.js"</span><span>;</span>

<span>inject</span><span>(</span><span>"globalServiceId"</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>service</span>: <span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// do stuff with Service</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>As a result, <code>./service.js</code> will never get run, and things will break at runtime.</p><p>To avoid this class of issues, we realized we needed to give users more fine-grained control over how things were getting imported/elided.</p><p>As a solution in TypeScript 3.8, we’ve added a new syntax for type-only imports and exports.</p><div><pre><span>import</span> <span>type</span> <span>{</span> <span>SomeThing</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./some-module.js"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>type</span> <span>{</span> <span>SomeThing</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p><code>import type</code> only imports declarations to be used for type annotations and declarations. It <em>always</em> gets fully erased, so there’s no remnant of it at runtime. Similarly, <code>export type</code> only provides an export that can be used for type contexts, and is also erased from TypeScript’s output.</p><p>It’s important to note that classes have a value at runtime and a type at design-time, and the use is context-sensitive. When using <code>import type</code> to import a class, you can’t do things like extend from it.</p><div><pre><span>import</span> <span>type</span> <span>{</span> <span>Component</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

<span>interface</span> <span>ButtonProps</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Button</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Component</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ButtonProps</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>//               ~~~~~~~~~</span>
    <span>// error! 'Component' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.</span>

    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div><p>If you’ve used Flow before, the syntax is fairly similar. One difference is that we’ve added a few restrictions to avoid code that might appear ambiguous.</p><div><pre><span>// Is only 'Foo' a type? Or every declaration in the import?</span>
<span>// We just give an error because it's not clear.</span>

<span>import</span> <span>type</span> <span>Foo</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>Bar</span><span>,</span> <span>Baz</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"some-module"</span><span>;</span>
<span>//     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>
<span>// error! A type-only import can specify a default import or named bindings, but not both.</span></pre></div><p>In conjunction with <code>import type</code>, we’ve also added a new compiler flag to control what happens with imports that won’t be utilized at runtime: <code>importsNotUsedAsValues</code>. This flag takes 3 different values:</p><ul><li><code>remove</code>: this is today’s behavior of dropping these imports. It’s going to continue to be the default, and is a non-breaking change.</li><li><code>preserve</code>: this <em>preserves</em> all imports whose values are never used. This can cause imports/side-effects to be preserved.</li><li><code>error</code>: this preserves all imports (the same as the <code>preserve</code> option), but will error when a value import is only used as a type. This might be useful if you want to ensure no values are being accidentally imported, but still make side-effect imports explicit.</li></ul><p>For more information about the feature, you can <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/35200" target="_blank">take a look at the pull request</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/36092/" target="_blank">relevant changes</a> around broadening where imports from an <code>import type</code> declaration can be used.</p><h2><span id="ecmascript-private-fields">ECMAScript Private Fields</span></h2><p>TypeScript 3.8 brings support for ECMAScript’s private fields, part of the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/" target="_blank">stage-3 class fields proposal</a>.

Some of them are:</p><ul><li>Private fields start with a <code>#</code> character. Sometimes we call these <em>private names</em>.</li><li>Every private field name is uniquely scoped to its containing class.</li><li>TypeScript accessibility modifiers like <code>public</code> or <code>private</code> can’t be used on private fields.</li><li>Private fields can’t be accessed or even detected outside of the containing class – even by JS users! Sometimes we call this <em>hard privacy</em>.</li></ul><p>Apart from “hard” privacy, another benefit of private fields is that uniqueness we just mentioned. For example, regular property declarations are prone to being overwritten in subclasses.</p><div><pre><span>class</span> <span>C</span> <span>{</span>

If you’re a library author, removing or renaming a private field should never cause a breaking change.</p><p>As we mentioned, another benefit is that subclassing can be easier with ECMAScript’s <code>#</code> privates because they <em>really</em> are private. When using ECMAScript <code>#</code> private fields, no subclass ever has to worry about collisions in field naming. When it comes to TypeScript’s <code>private</code> property declarations, users still have to be careful not to trample over properties declared in superclasses.</p><p>One more thing to think about is where you intend for your code to run. TypeScript currently can’t support this feature unless targeting ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) targets or higher. This is because our downleveled implementation uses <code>WeakMap</code>s to enforce privacy, and <code>WeakMap</code>s can’t be polyfilled in a way that doesn’t cause memory leaks. In contrast, TypeScript’s <code>private</code>-declared properties work with all targets – even ECMAScript 3!</p><p>A final consideration might be speed: <code>private</code> properties are no different from any other property, so accessing them is as fast as any other property access no matter which runtime you target. In contrast, because <code>#</code> private fields are downleveled using <code>WeakMap</code>s, they may be slower to use. While some runtimes might optimize their actual implementations of <code>#</code> private fields, and even have speedy <code>WeakMap</code> implementations, that might not be the case in all runtimes.</p><h3>Kudos!</h3><p>It’s worth reiterating how much work went into this feature from our contributors at Bloomberg.

This is because the number of available file watchers is often eclipsed by the of files in <code>node_modules</code>, whereas there are way fewer directories to track.</p><p>Older versions of TypeScript would <em>immediately</em> install directory watchers on folders, and at startup that would be fine; however, during an npm install, a lot of activity will take place within <code>node_modules</code> and that can overwhelm TypeScript, often slowing editor sessions to a crawl. To prevent this, TypeScript 3.8 waits slightly before installing directory watchers to give these highly volatile directories some time to stabilize.</p><p>Because every project might work better under different strategies, and this new approach might not work well for your workflows, TypeScript 3.8 introduces a new <code>watchOptions</code> field in <code>tsconfig.json</code> and <code>jsconfig.json</code> which allows users to tell the compiler/language service which watching strategies should be used to keep track of files and directories.</p><div><pre><span>{</span>

Turning on <code>--incremental</code> mode makes TypeScript keep track of which files can affect others, and on top of doing that, <code>--watch</code> mode keeps the compiler process open and reuses as much information in memory as possible.</p><p>However, for much larger projects, even the dramatic gains in speed that these options afford us isn’t enough. For example, the Visual Studio Code team had built their own build tool around TypeScript called <code>gulp-tsb</code> which would be less accurate in assessing which files needed to be rechecked/rebuilt in its watch mode, and as a result, could provide drastically low build times.</p><p>Sacrificing accuracy for build speed, for better or worse, is a tradeoff many are willing to make in the TypeScript/JavaScript world. Lots of users prioritize tightening their iteration time over addressing the errors up-front. As an example, it’s fairly common to build code regardless of the results of type-checking or linting.</p><p>TypeScript 3.8 introduces a new compiler option called <code>assumeChangesOnlyAffectDirectDependencies</code>. When this option is enabled, TypeScript will avoid rechecking/rebuilding all truly possibly-affected files, and only recheck/rebuild files that have changed as well as files that directly import them.</p><p>For example, consider a file <code>fileD.ts</code> that imports <code>fileC.ts</code> that imports <code>fileB.ts</code> that imports <code>fileA.ts</code> as follows:</p><pre><code>fileA.ts &lt;- fileB.ts &lt;- fileC.ts &lt;- fileD.ts
</code></pre><p>In <code>--watch</code> mode, a change in <code>fileA.ts</code> would typically mean that TypeScript would need to at least re-check <code>fileB.ts</code>, <code>fileC.ts</code>, and <code>fileD.ts</code>. Under <code>assumeChangesOnlyAffectDirectDependencies</code>, a change in <code>fileA.ts</code> means that only <code>fileA.ts</code> and <code>fileB.ts</code> need to be re-checked.</p><p>In a codebase like Visual Studio Code, this reduced rebuild times for changes in certain files from about 14 seconds to about 1 second. While we don’t necessarily recommend this option for all codebases, you might be interested if you have an extremely large codebase and are willing to defer full project errors until later (e.g. a dedicated build via a <code>tsconfig.fullbuild.json</code> or in CI).</p><p>For more details, you can <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/35711" target="_blank">see the original pull request</a>.</p><h2><span id="editor-features">Editor Features</span></h2><h3><span id="convert-to-template-string">Convert to Template String</span></h3><p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bigaru" target="_blank">Arooran Thanabalasingam (bigaru)</a>, TypeScript 3.8 ships a new refactoring to convert string concatenations like</p><div><pre><span>"I have "</span> <span>+</span> <span>numApples</span> <span>+</span> <span>" apples"</span></pre></div><p>into template strings like the following.</p><div><pre><span>`I have <span><span>${</span>numApples<span>}</span></span> apples`</span></pre></div><p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/convertToTemplateString-3.8.gif" data-featherlight="image"> <img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/convertToTemplateString-3.8.gif" alt="Convert to template string in action"> </a></p><h3><span id="call-hierarchy">Call Hierarchy</span></h3><p>It’s often useful to figure out who’s calling a given function.

<span>}</span></pre></div><p>This is because treating it as TypeScript’s <code>Object</code> type would end up in code reporting uninteresting errors, since the <code>Object</code> type is an extremely vague type with few capabilities other than methods like <code>toString</code> and <code>valueOf</code>.</p><p>However, TypeScript <em>does</em> have a more useful type named <code>object</code> (notice that lowercase <code>o</code>). The <code>object</code> type is more restrictive than <code>Object</code>, in that it rejects all primitive types like <code>string</code>, <code>boolean</code>, and <code>number</code>. Unfortunately, both <code>Object</code> and <code>object</code> were treated as <code>any</code> in JSDoc.</p><p>Because <code>object</code> can come in handy and is used significantly less than <code>Object</code> in JSDoc, we’ve removed the special-case behavior in JavaScript files when using <code>noImplicitAny</code> so that in JSDoc, the <code>object</code> type really refers to the non-primitive <code>object</code> type.</p><h2>What’s Next?</h2><p>We anticipate that our next version, TypeScript 3.9, will be coming mid-May of 2020, and will mostly focus on performance, polish, and potentially smarter type-checking for <code>Promise</code>s. In the coming days our planning documents will be published to give an idea of specifics.</p><p>But please don’t wait until 3.9 – 3.8 is a fantastic release with lots of great improvements, so grab it today!</p><p>Have fun, and happy hacking!</p><p>– Daniel Rosenwasser and the TypeScript Team</p></div></div></div></div>
