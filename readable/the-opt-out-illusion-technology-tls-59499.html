<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The film <i>The Life of Others</i> (2006) is set in East Germany in the early 1980s and features a government agent who spends his days wearing a headset, listening to private conversations in the homes of suspected dissidents. He feels sympathy for his subjects – and guilt for his actions. He knows that if he reports any sign of subversion that person could be arrested.</p>
<p>Today we are all under similar surveillance, this time by Silicon Valley capitalists. They are not watching us for political dissent but for our “behavioral surplus”, the crumbs of data about what we do, where we go, what we look at, what we buy. This surplus is used for the purposes of targeted advertising. It has made them billions, and left many of us wondering how we got into this situation.</p>
<p>In <i>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</i>, Shoshana Zuboff explains how. She is scathing about many of the main players. The executive Sheryl Sandberg is described as the “Typhoid Mary” of the practice, carrying it from Google to Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg, in Zuboff’s telling, seems temperamentally attuned to <i>surveillance capitalism</i> – either disinclined philosophically to believe in privacy as a value, or so bent on power he simply doesn’t care. (Zuckerberg suggested at the Crunchie Awards in 2013 that privacy was no longer a “social norm”.) In its lifetime, Facebook has faced a series of privacy scandals, starting with the Beacon project in 2007, which, to much outrage, shared the details of a given user’s purchases from stores that advertised on the platform with their entire list of contacts. Zuboff provides the account of one user whose purchase of an engagement ring was shared with his girlfriend (and everyone he knew) before he had the chance to propose. Zuckerberg apologized for the misstep, but the thinking behind Beacon remains central to Facebook’s business model.</p>

<p>Such privacy breaches have over the years led users to fight back. Google’s Street View project, initiated in 2001, was met with some resistance. People baulked at having an image of their home published online, let alone an image of them walking down the street. (Google blurred faces but many remained recognizable.) Some blocked road access to Google’s cars; others wore carnival masks or animal costumes when they knew the cars would be passing. Resistance hardened when it turned out that Google’s vehicles were also mapping for wifi signals and noting passwords and other information. (This was blamed on a rogue operative in programming, another “mistake”.) Entire countries pushed back: Germany demanded residents be allowed to have their house blurred. A quarter of a million people made the request. And so Google abandoned the Street View project in Germany: it still runs, but images are not updated. Street View is also partly banned in Switzerland and Austria, restricted to tourist areas.</p>
<p>These are the exceptions. In 2009 John Hanke, then vice president for the company’s mapping projects, told the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> that concerns over Street View had “mostly died off” in the West, and remained an issue only in countries where the “government is used to controlling everything”. As Zuboff suggests, this was a clever pivot, associating resistance not with civil liberties but with totalitarianism. And Street View largely succeeded, with much of the world now mapped. As its creators predicted, we like it, and use it. We are complicit victims.</p>
<p>One of Google’s other surveillance-minded ideas was Google Glass – the enhanced spectacles that left most consumers cold. Poor demand led Google to quietly drop them from its marketing strategy. It seemed that the possibility of users live-streaming everything around them hadn’t struck a chord. When they were released, to much fanfare, in 2014, Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin brushed off privacy concerns, telling the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, “People always have a natural aversion to innovation”. Another response to the apparent luddites has been to argue that people shouldn’t mind as long as they have “nothing to hide”. But nobody has nothing to hide. Zuboff argues that “nothing to hide” means being nothing at all. Having private histories and a place of sanctuary is – or was – a part of being human.</p>
<p><i>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</i> is long, and Zuboff’s blow-by-blow accounts of the key players ignoring, mocking and finally riding roughshod over even governmental efforts to stop them are consistently shocking. The punishments meted out for incursions often seem trivial, given the companies’ power. For Google, a $100,000 penalty for infringement of privacy is like an ordinary citizen being caught speeding and fined a penny. In the EU regulators have recently started to toughen up, however, spurred by consumer activism and non-profit groups such as Austria’s NOYB, and following the institution of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). In January the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) issued a fine of €50 million to Google for “lack of transparency” and “lack of valid consent” regarding the personalization of adverts. It may be that such rulings will produce lasting change, but we will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>For now the system is set up to trap the user. We’ve all visited websites that confront us with a pop-up acknowledging our privacy and asking us to agree to the terms. But the pop-up won’t let us pass without clicking “agree”. Opting out is an illusion. The extraction of our behavioural data is non-negotiable. To illustrate this bind, Zuboff describes one of the many “smart” connected-home devices now available: Nest thermostats. The data amassed by the device goes to Google’s servers and the user must agree to its being shared with unnamed third parties, for unspecified reasons. Should the customer refuse, terms of service mean the thermostat may not work properly, and will not be supported by necessary updates. You can say no, but that means you get a system that doesn’t work. In the EU the GDPR directive obliges tech companies to inform users what data they are collecting – but this can still be confusing (we supposedly have control, but “no cookies at all, ever” is not an option). One outcome of the GDPR is that some American websites, such as the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, have simply blocked access to visitors from European IP addresses, rather than have to deal with the new rules.</p>
<p>Technological capability alone would not have been enough for these organizations to have achieved such dominance. Historical circumstances also played into their fortunes. By the time the dotcom bubble began to deflate in 2000, people were asking questions about tech firms’ power. The firms’ salvation – and their entrenchment in our lives – came with the attacks of 9/11. Problems became blessings to governments scrambling to respond: violation of privacy is useful if it helps us to track down an al-Qaeda operative. “Practices that just hours earlier were careening towards legislative action were quickly recast as mission-critical necessities”, writes Zuboff. Governments co-opted the surveillance capitalists, who were happy to oblige. Today, law enforcement agencies use Facebook to track suspects. Mobile phones are a dream to security services, providing GPS data on almost anyone they want to investigate. To illustrate surveillance capitalism’s increasingly symbiotic relationship with government, Zuboff cites the exchange between Google and the Barack Obama administration. During Obama’s presidency twenty-two White House officials went to work at Google, while thirty-one executives from Google and its subsidiaries joined the White House or federal advisory boards. This version of “regulatory capture” extends beyond Washington. Last year Nick Clegg left politics to become Facebook’s Vice-President for Global Affairs and Communications.</p>
<p>Zuboff draws a distinction between Apple and Microsoft, on the one hand, and Facebook and Google on the other. Apple and Microsoft are selling us tangible goods; Facebook and Google are offering us their services for free. We are not their customers. A common quip is that “if it’s free, you’re the product”. Zuboff corrects this: we are the raw material. Our behavioural data is the product; we are the refuse of resource extraction. The author reminds us of Karl Marx’s image of capitalism as “a vampire that feeds on labour”. But she perceives “an unexpected turn. Instead of labour, surveillance capitalism feeds on every aspect of every human’s existence”. Few of us can escape this level of surveillance. Even non-users of Facebook are tracked by it, with cookies on other sites. Never mind using a VPN, we are still ensnared by our phones. Convenience systems operated by voice commands may be listening to us even when we’re not using them. Turning off apps does not protect us. Even switching off the phone and removing the SIM is not enough to prevent tracking.</p>
<p>The deeper story is our acquiescence with this situation, our bowing to what Zuboff characterizes as surveillance capitalism’s sense of “inevitability”. We feel helpless to resist before the march of “progress”. So what can we do? Every privacy-breach scandal is followed by a mealy-mouthed apology, and then things go back to where they were. Zuboff draws a comparison with the Gilded Age, a period of intense inequality that taught people “how they did not want to live”. Reform and eventually the New Deal followed. She suggests the Age of Surveillance Capitalism is also showing us how we do not want to live, and that we must resist the advance towards a new status quo dictated by tech giants. Surveillance capitalism is not a foregone conclusion. We have the capacity to “reclaim the digital future as humanity’s home”.</p>
