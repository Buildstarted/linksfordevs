    <blockquote><span>Abstract:</span>  Previous proposals to permit non-exponential free-path statistics in
radiative transfer have not included support for volume and boundary sources
that are spatially uncorrelated from the scattering events in the medium.
Birth-collision free paths are treated identically to collision-collision free
paths and application of this to general, bounded scenes with inclusions leads
to non-reciprocal transport. Beginning with reciprocity as a desired property,
we propose a new way to integrate non-exponential transport theory into general
scenes. We distinguish between the free-path-length statistics between
correlated medium particles and the free-path-length statistics beginning at
locations not correlated to medium particles, such as boundary surfaces,
inclusions and uncorrelated sources. Reciprocity requires that the uncorrelated
free-path distributions are simply the normalized transmittance of the
correlated free-path distributions. The combination leads to an equilibrium
imbedding of a previously derived generalized transport equation into bounded
domains. We compare predictions of this approach to Monte Carlo simulation of
multiple scattering from negatively-correlated suspensions of monodispersive
hard spheres in bounded two-dimensional domains and demonstrate improved
performance relative to previous work. We also derive new, exact, reciprocal,
single-scattering solutions for plane-parallel half-spaces over a variety of
non-exponential media types.
