Earth, along with a bunch of alien planets, is part of the United Federation of Planets (The Federation) which is a like a space U.N., devoted to universal liberty, rights, equality, sharing knowledge, and exploring the galaxy.</p><p id="d08c" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the world of <em>Star Trek</em>, hunger and poverty have been eliminated. Energy comes from matter-antimatter reactors (or something). Food is created instantly in replicators. Humanity has dedicated itself to exploration and self-improvement.</p><p id="dda6" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the first season, in an episode I’m going to tell you to watch, Captain Picard defrosts a cryogenically frozen Gordon Gecko type figure from our century named Ralph Offenhouse, and they have this conversation:</p><blockquote><p id="2362" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Offenhouse:</strong> There’s no trace of my money — my office is gone — what will I do? How will I live?</p><p id="81dc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Picard:</strong> [Amused] This is the 24th century. Those material needs no longer exist.</p><p id="4435" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Offenhouse:</strong> Then what’s the challenge?</p><p id="af4a" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Picard:</strong> To improve yourself… enrich yourself. Enjoy it, Mister Offenhouse.</p></blockquote><p id="cc00" data-selectable-paragraph="">This depiction of the future feels impossible in 2015. Corny. Twee. Look at the big science fiction films that came out last year: <em>The Hunger Games</em>, <em>Days of Future Past</em>, <em>Planet of the Apes</em>, <em>Interstellar</em>, <em>Transformers: Age of Extinction </em>(I didn’t see this but I’m guessing based on the title)<em>,</em> <em>Snowpiercer</em>… all of those movies show us a future where humanity gives in to its worst impulses, with apocalyptic results.</p><p id="5a6f" data-selectable-paragraph="">The politics of Star Trek point to something important in our culture that we don’t think about as being fundamental to the way we live. Author Daniel Quinn writes:</p><blockquote><p id="d0aa" data-selectable-paragraph="">Nothing is more fundamental than food. There’s only one way you can force people to accept an intolerable lifestyle. You have to lock up the food. Though it surely isn’t recognized at the time, locking up the food is the beginning of the hierarchical life we call civilization.</p><p id="823d" data-selectable-paragraph="">As soon as the storehouse appears, someone must step forward to guard it, and this custodian needs assistants, who depend on him entirely, since they no longer earn their living as farmers. A manager class soon emerged to look after the accumulation and storage of surpluses — something that had never been necessary when everyone was just working a few hours a day. They soon came to be regarded as social and political leaders. In a single stroke, a figure of power appears on the scene to control the community’s wealth, surrounded by a cadre of loyal vassals, ready to evolve into a ruling class of royals and nobles.</p><p id="7e4b" data-selectable-paragraph="">What these founders of our culture fundamentally invented for us was the notion of work. They developed a hard way to live — the hardest way to live ever found on this planet. Their revolution wasn’t about food, it was about power. That’s still what it’s all about.</p></blockquote><p id="fab9" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Star Trek </em>has a special place in my heart because it shows us a future where we continue to advance technology and explore without destroying ourselves or shouting over each other on Twitter all day. We should all be aware of the many difficult material concerns in our lives, and the unjust power structures that we’re implicated in. But what does life look like without them? Who’s thinking about what comes next? Captain Picard, that’s who.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="495d" data-selectable-paragraph="">One of the important things to know about TNG is that it sucked for the first few seasons.</p><p id="186c" data-selectable-paragraph="">That’s not surprising —how do you write a great, dramatic episode of TV when one of the main rules is that the cast can’t have conflict with each other?</p><p id="b2ea" data-selectable-paragraph="">TNG writer <a href="http://trekmovie.com/2014/09/12/exclusive-david-gerrold-talks-frankly-about-tng-conflicts-with-roddenberry-berman-jj-trek-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">David Gerrold said</a>:</p><blockquote><p id="e3fb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Well that came from [Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry’s] lawyer Leonard Maizlish, a scumbag of a human being. I cannot say enough things — he was a truly evil human being. He was going to be Gene’s helper on the show. He appointed himself Chief of Staff and he would go around and say we can’t do this and we can’t do that and “on Star Trek everybody loves each other.” For those of us who had written for the show knew that wasn’t true! We knew our people got into arguments. But what happened was he would go to Gene and say “you can’t let David do this and can’t let Dorothy do that.” Everybody has to be good friends. It is that whole “band of brothers” thing we established in the first. Well, no. There should be tension between these people who have different jobs.</p></blockquote><p id="9745" data-selectable-paragraph="">Roddenberry died in 1991, and new writers joined the show. One of them was Ronald D. Moore (who would go on to create <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>) who <a href="http://www.lcarscom.net/rdm1000118.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said about the <em>Star Trek</em> formula</a>:</p><blockquote><p id="8909" data-selectable-paragraph="">When I came aboard in the third season, <em>NEXT GEN</em> was very much the new kid on the block. There was a lot of static from the fans about the old series. “You can never replace Kirk and Spock; it’s not the real <em>Enterprise</em>, and this isn’t <em>STAR TREK</em>.” People forget that. Now <em>NEXT GEN</em>, everybody holds it up as the greatest thing. But nobody was giving us those plaudits at the beginning. We felt a bit under siege when I was there. There wasn’t a lot of support out in the fan community. At conventions people were still selling bumper stickers that said “Kirk and Spock forever.”</p><p id="8bd1" data-selectable-paragraph="">[…]</p><p id="60e4" data-selectable-paragraph="">You just can’t keep feeding the audience the same thing over and over again, while at the same time, talking out of the other side of your mouth, saying, “But it’s all completely different; it’s a <em>STAR TREK</em> you’ve never seen before. It’s so different; we are doing things with <em>STAR TREK</em> that no one has ever done.” It’s still guys in pajamas looking at viewscreens and sitting in chairs. It can be more than that.</p></blockquote><p id="4f7b" data-selectable-paragraph="">The silver lining here is that TNG is a show designed for syndication — each episode is a self-contained story, and it’s okay to skip around. My episode guide below is designed to get you through the bumpy early seasons to see what TNG looks like when it becomes more than the sum of its parts — a great ensemble, world-class writing, and science fiction that is unparalleled today.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="9e55" data-selectable-paragraph="">So where to start? The first great episode of TNG comes in season 2, <em>Measure of a Man</em>. The <em>Enterprise</em> docks at a starbase, and a scientist there wants to disassemble the <em>Enterprise’s</em> android Science Officer, Data. No weapons are fired in this episode, there are no action sequences. But it’s one of the most gripping episodes of television I’ve ever seen, a little allegory about slavery, artificial intelligence, friendship, personal sacrifice, the rights of the individual vs. the greater good.</p><p id="2d4a" data-selectable-paragraph="">Patrick Stewart (the actor who plays Captain Picard) <a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/12/04/patrick-stewart-star-trek-tng-measure-of-a-man/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently said</a> that this was “the first truly great episode of the series,” and he gives an incredible performance. I think this is the first time he really commands the screen and finds his character — you’re watching the creation of a television icon. Whoopi Goldberg gives a great performance as well.</p><p id="d5a8" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>If you want to give TNG a shot, fire up Netflix and watch </strong><a href="http://www.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70177897&amp;trkid=200109583" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>S02E09: <em>The Measure of a Man</em></strong></a><strong><em>. </em></strong><em>You can also stream TNG in HD </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DBYBNEE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DBYBNEE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=maxistentiali-20&amp;linkId=3QKERHXQ2NSAQSQU" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>if you have Amazon Prime</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="47fb" data-selectable-paragraph="">The first season stinks.
