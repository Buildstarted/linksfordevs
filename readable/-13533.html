But I was impressed by how they seemed to do their best to keep what was good about the old show while bringing it into the 21st century at the same time. Granted, getting used to the new characters was jarring at first: but it was the same when Weinstein was replaced by Murphy and Coniff, Hodgeson by Nelson, and Bellieu by Corbett. Eventually I got used to them all. In my opinion, the new characters are at least as funny as the old. The new "Gypsy" in particular is a huge improvement. All the production values are much improved (as you would expect after 30 years). I even love Kinga Forrester and TV's son of TV's Frank (Max) even though it's a stretch to believe that Clayton Forrester or TV's Frank ever had kids. So I just repeat to myself "it's just a show, I should really just relax"</span>

There were some good lines, but I'd like to see the writing improve if this continues into a second season. To be fair, it appears Netflix only gave the cast, crew and writers a very small window to get these episodes turned out. I remember watching a documentary on the original series where they would watch and riff the movies several times during the week to perfect the jokes and had time for rehearsals, etc. Perhaps they can work a deal to get more time per episode much like the original series. New cast was good and it was nice to see some of the original cast make appearances. All in all, (since I have almost all of the original series on DVD), I'm glad I got this set to continue collecting the DVDs and I'm glad they brought back the series.</span>

Turns out the defining factor of the series reboot wasn't the audience's high hopes, it was the time crunch: how'd Joel and the cast feel when they found out that they had to record the entire 11th season overnight?<p>There was no time to fine-tune their characters: "Jonah Heston" is a blank slate, Crow and Servo are generic cartoon wiseguys, and as for Kinga Forrester and Max...well, there's always next season.  A string of guest stars comes and goes, and the riffing is on a par with what you would've heard in the original series' first and second seasons: it's gettin' there, but it's still a work in progress.</p></span>

People's opinions are as varied as our selection of favorites on the SOL.  That being said...I loved it!  Ok...I get it...it's not Mike or Joel...or the Mads...or Brain Guy...yadda yadda yadda...but it is a viable and worthwhile attempt at ensuring that our beloved MST3K is still out there.  Yes...Netflix has cancelled it...so what.  Get the sets...binge watch for a while...remember why we loved the franchise in the first place.  Is Jonah a good foil for the new Mads?  You decide...All I can say is that if you approach this edition with an open mind, you'll not be disappointed...you might even be surprised at what stinkers are riff worthy out there...Keep it up and keep that tape/disc/url circulating!</span>

One thing I can say the riff a lot almost to much they need to go back the to the way the old crews did the riffing.  Riff let the movie run riff and so on what they do is riff riff riff riff riff oh is the a movie playing riff riff riff riff....  I'm at three stars now will see if I change that after watching them again.</span>

Sometimes you move on to new people, whether it's Doctor Who, James Bond, Batman, Tarzan...geez, there are dozens of potential comparisons. Get over yourselves.<br>I've enjoyed the new episodes of MST3K a few times each on Netflix and yet I did not hesitate to pick up the dvd set. They've tweaked the back story, replaced the Mads with a couple of my favorites and given new voices to my old buddies, Tom, Crow and Gypsy. They're throwing hundreds of jokes at some of the goofiest movies they could find and if every joke doesn't amaze you, hold on: There will be another one in a few seconds.<br>It's just an embarrassment of riches having MST back and still have Rifftrax out there.<br>Waiting eagerly for season 12. Just hope Jonah Heston didn't die (Spoiler!!)</span>

And if you put bias aside and "really just relax," you'll quite enjoy the rebirth of MST3K. In fact, some of my all time favorite MST3K episodes now reside within this very season! Not the least of which is "Cry Wilderness." Omfg was that funny. I'd watch that episode again and again with anyone willing to watch it with me (and have).<p>**Cry Wilderness TITLE CARD appears**<br>MST3K Hosts: "Well... if you insist....
