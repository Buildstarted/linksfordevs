<p>As of 2019/9/18 we are officially announcing extension of our .NET teams in Prague, Czech Republic:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>.NET Tooling team</strong> - see <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/646082/Software-Engineer-NET-TOOLING">full job description</a> where you can apply
    <ul>
      <li>We are adding 2 additional full teams (incl. manager position for each of them).</li>
      <li>Positions: Software Engineer &amp; Software Engineer Manager
        <ul>
          <li>Note: The manager position will be published later (over next couple of weeks) - in the meantime, please apply to the Software Engineer position above and mentioned you are interested in the manager position on the team.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Basic infornation:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Location: Prague, Czech Republic</li>
  <li>Remote: No (we expect 60% presence in Microsoft Prague office)</li>
  <li>Relocation: Yes</li>
  <li>Visa sponsorship: Yes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> We expect to host a hiring event in Prague 11/18-11/20. We will conduct some interviews remotely/ad-hoc when candidate availability is limited at the time of the hiring event.</p>

<p>For context, we have hired during this summer 2 full teams which are already starting in Prague:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>.NET Engineering Services team</strong> - see <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-evolving-infrastructure-of-net-core/">this blog post</a> to learn what the team does (manager of the team will start in October). Note: Currently we are not looking for more applicants to this specific job position.</li>
  <li><strong>Base Class Libraries / Networking team</strong> - see <a href="https://karelz.github.io/networking_resources">this post</a> to learn what the team does, and where it is heading (managed by <a href="https://twitter.com/ziki_cz">ziki_cz</a>). Note: Currently we are not looking for more applicants to this specific job position.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="international-teams-working-across-time-zones">International teams working across time-zones</h3>

<p>Note that the teams are part of larger international teams working across time-zones (esp. in US West-coast time-zone - PT, which is 9 hours behind CET time-zone in Europe, so 9am PT is 18 CET).
Expect, that the job will require also occasional availability in US West-coast business hours.</p>

<p>It does not mean you have to work more or longer hours!
Your work hours will be flexible, but the job will require you at times to attend some meetings, or communicate with some colleagues at hours outside of “classic” European business hours.
While it is manageable, it is something to consider as it may impact your established schedule and it may require some flexibility from your side.</p>

<p>If you have questions, or concerns, please bring it up in your discussion with recruiters or hiring managers.</p>

<p>Note that our larger teams already have a few individual remote workers working from Europe, incl. Prague.
Our US-based team members are used to working with remote workers in Europe and to accommodate to their availability limitations.
We can share some of their experiences with you if it helps you to make a decision.</p>
