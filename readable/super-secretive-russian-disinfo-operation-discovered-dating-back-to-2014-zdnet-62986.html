<p>According to Graphika's analysis, most of the group's content has followed nine primary themes:</p><ul><li>Ukraine as a failed state or unreliable partner</li><li>The United States and NATO as aggressive and interfering in other countries</li><li>Europe as weak and divided</li><li>Critics of the Russian government as morally corrupt, alcoholic, or otherwise mentally unstable</li><li>Muslims as aggressive invaders</li><li>The Russian government as the victim of Western hypocrisy or plots</li><li>Western elections as rigged and candidates who criticized the Kremlin as unelectable</li><li>Turkey as an aggressive and destabilizing state</li><li>World sporting bodies and competitions as unfair, unprofessional, and Russophobic</li></ul><p>Graphika says that most of this content has been aimed at attacking classic Russian political rivals like Ukraine, the US, Poland, and Germany, but also other countries where Russian influence came under attack, at one point or another.</p>


    <p>Graphika said the group didn't publish only in English, but also adapted to each target and published content in its local language. In total, researchers found content posted in seven languages.</p><figure><span><img src="https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/06/16/3fa94b0c-ba12-4a47-a4f6-c6a2c3bb1eda/graphika-articles-per-country.jpg" alt="graphika-articles-per-country.jpg" data-original="https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/06/16/3fa94b0c-ba12-4a47-a4f6-c6a2c3bb1eda/graphika-articles-per-country.jpg"></span><figcaption><span></span><span>

Unlike the sloppy IRA operators who were easily traced back to an exact building in Sankt Petersburg, Russia, the mystery about Secondary Infektion's real identity remains unsolved.</p><p>"[Secondary Infektion's] identity is the single most pressing question to emerge from this study," the Graphika team wrote in its report today.</p><p>Researchers said the group managed to keep its identity secret because they paid very close attention to operational security (OpSec). Graphika says Secondary Infektion agents employed single-use burner accounts for almost everything they posted online, abandoning each account in less than an hour after promoting their content.</p><p>This approach has made it more difficult for the group to build a dedicated audience but has allowed it to orchestrate high-impact operations for years, without giving away their infrastructure, modus operandi, and goals.</p><p>With its identity still a secret, the group is expected to continue operating and sowing conflict between Russia's rivals.</p>
