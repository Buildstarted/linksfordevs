                    <p>The following is a list of many bugs caught on or near leap day, February 29th, 2020. &nbsp;Each link below references the issue with supporting details where available. &nbsp;This list does <em>not </em>include bugs that were already caught and repaired before they could have impact on leap day.</p><p><em>Last updated 2020-02-29 3:30 PM PST</em></p><h4 id="verified-unresolved">Verified / Unresolved</h4><p>Items in this section have been verified, and have not yet been resolved.</p><ul><li>Many people reported their cell phones were showing Feb 28th when it was actually Feb 29th, or some variation of showing the wrong date. &nbsp;Most appear to be on the Sprint network, and for at least one, <a href="https://twitter.com/sprintcare/status/1233772520290963456">Sprint confirmed the issue and stated they were working on it</a>. &nbsp;Reports: <a

section have been verified to have occurred near the leap day, but may or may not have been caused by a leap year bug.</p><ul><li>National Australia Bank’s merchant and business banking facility, NAB Connect, <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/nab-connect-business-customers-hit-by-outage-538726">had an outage that started around lunchtime on Feb 28th</a>. &nbsp;It was <a href="https://twitter.com/NAB/status/1233695686098444288">reported resolved as of 9 PM local time on Feb 29th.</a> It may or may not have been caused by a leap day bug, but <a href="https://twitter.com/ssharwood/status/1233273159811338241">at least one person felt that it was</a>, and several customers have complained to NAB on social media, including <a href="https://twitter.com/Chloe_Belle4/status/1233294674191736833">this one</a>.</li><li>A software glitch in the HR software for the Tamil Nadu, India government, <a

brought to my attention by others, however I have not been able to confirm their validity. &nbsp;They may possibly not have happened at all.</p><ul><li>Some reported the date on their wristwatch skipped over the leap day, including <a href="https://twitter.com/scottcale/status/1233639798675345410">a Timex Expedition watch</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/SULTANAIF/status/1233744689959968777">a Casio watch</a>. &nbsp;Another person <a href="https://twitter.com/dchest/status/1233874658052710400">gave a photo of various Casio watches</a> including several that <em>were</em> working correctly, and an <a href="https://www.casio.com/products/watches/classic/f91w-1">F91W-1</a> which was not (though that is by design since that model does not keep track of the year, per <a href="https://support.casio.com/storage/en/manual/pdf/EN/009/qw593.pdf">its documentation</a>.).</li><li>A user of the app for a Portuguese grocery store, Pão de Açúcar, <a href="https://twitter.com/kievgama/status/1233763206134403077">highlighted a possible error</a> with the app on Feb 29th.</li><li>A person reported <a

year bugs with their Amazon purchase experiences. &nbsp;Reports: <a href="https://twitter.com/MaartenJS/status/1233582077905272832">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dijjitalj/status/1233730826136846338">2</a></li><li>Several users of Google Maps have seen wildly incorrect routes for transit navigation on in King County, Washington, USA on Feb 29th. &nbsp;It's unclear if the issue is with Google Maps, or with the underlying data source. &nbsp;Reports: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/fbdf40/heads_up_as_of_this_morning_google_maps_is/">1</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22452754">2</a></li><li>A person reported that all of the <a href="https://www.yealink.com/products_42.html">Yealink T56</a> business desk phones <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22452842">displayed February calendar events for the wrong day</a>.</li><li>One person <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22453171">reported</a> that LinkedIn listed the time they had been with their current employer incorrectly.</li><li>A firearms dealer <a href="https://twitter.com/LancoTactical/status/1233862151447683073">reported </a>that the <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/applications-eform-4473-download">E4473 software</a> released by the <a href="https://www.atf.gov/">US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives</a> is having trouble operating correctly today. &nbsp;This software is used by gun dealers to electronically complete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_4473">Form 4473</a>, registering firearms purchases.</li></ul><h4 id="verified-resolved">Verified / Resolved</h4><p>Items in this section had an impact on or near February 29th, were verified as bugs, and are now resolved.</p><ul><li>Users of <a href="https://shadow.tech/">Shadow</a>, a gaming streaming service, encountered an "L-104 error" when trying to log in from Windows PCs, starting at 4 PM PST on 2/28 (which is midnight UTC on 2/29). &nbsp;The company originally <a href="https://twitter.com/PurpleBooth/status/1233664183910227969/photo/1">asked their users to work around the bug</a> by disabling time synchronization and set their clocks forward to March 1st. &nbsp;They <a href="https://help.shadow.tech/hc/en-gb/articles/360011233839#h_819a3d67-40b1-4f0a-bed2-d8e04cfe87cc">issued an update</a> about 9½ hours later correcting the problem, and then asked users to turn time synchronization back on. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowPC/comments/fb88cx/l104_issue_workaround/">Full discussion on Reddit</a>. &nbsp;(Excellent transparency here, but I don't recommend disabling time sync. &nbsp;That can lead to many other issues.)</li></ul><h4 id="verified-resolved-unknown-impact">Verified / Resolved / Unknown Impact</h4><p>Items in this section are also verified and resolved, but the vendor did not supply any supporting details as to what problems they actually had.</p><ul><li><em>(None yet, reserving this section for future updates to this post.)</em></li></ul><h4 id="verified-deferred">Verified / Deferred</h4><p>Items in this section had an impact on February 29th, but were either resolved through manual workarounds, or will resolve themselves on March 1st without any specific fix or resolution reported. &nbsp;One assumes that the responsible party will take appropriate action before the next leap day in 2024, or has already taken such action, but to the best of my knowledge no confirmation of that has yet been provided.</p><ul><li>An <a href="https://migogaalborg.dk/store-dele-af-aalborg-moerkelagt-derfor-gik-det-galt/">automated streetlight system failed to operate correctly</a> for the entire city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aalborg">Aalborg</a>, Denmark's fourth largest city. &nbsp;It took a few hours of darkness before the city's operations manager could figure out the problem and turn the lights on manually.</li></ul><h4 id="honorary-mention">Honorary Mention</h4><ul><li><a href="https://www.timehop.com/">Timehop</a>, which made my list from 2016 also, did indeed decide that <a href="https://twitter.com/mjanner/status/1233706023074095104">it's not a bug but a feature</a>! &nbsp;(and with <a href="https://twitter.com/mjanner/status/1233706023074095104/photo/1">a funny error message graphic</a>!)</li><li>Bantshire University (a parody account, not a real university), let us know that all <a href="https://twitter.com/BantshireUni/status/1233697678179143680">IT systems are offline due to a complication with a date of March 0th</a>. 😂</li><li>Many developers mentioned that they encountered leap year bugs in their own code. &nbsp;Thanks for sharing! &nbsp; <a
