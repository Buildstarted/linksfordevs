<p>3 minute read</p>

<p>Open Source Software and especially large projects have a few defined standards that are used to promote welcoming new contributors and ensure a healthy collaborative environment like for example <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>, <code>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</code>, and <a href="https://github.blog/2016-02-17-issue-and-pull-request-templates/">issue/pull request templates</a>.</p>

<p>Despite this, even in popular projects, there is a disconcerting lack of guidance on the actual structure of the software and its inner workings.</p>

<p>For example, as a part of the <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/">open source Google Code-in event</a>, last winter I started contributing and still contribute to <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/">Public Lab</a>, an environmental community that develops environmental software.</p>

<p>This forum’s code base is relatively large, especially for an open source beginner. It has about ~25 controllers, ~30 models and a very complete testing suite with functional, unit and system testing all automated with Travis.</p>

<p>But I took some time and read through the code to understand how the different bits and pieces of the app interacted, and grew to a confident level with some parts and at least an abstraction of understanding with the others. I luckily also had the help of my mentors who answered my questions during this process.</p>

<p>Obviously, this mentorship is often unavailable and new contributors have to scrutinize the code base on their own, and try to come up with a vague understanding of the components that will prevent them from creating a breaking change in another part of the app.</p>

<p>For example, in other industries, usually physical blueprints serve as this stepping stone to provide an overview of how the product works as a whole and yet it’s often missing in software engineering.</p>

<p>Let’s take an example. I’ve been getting into the <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/">Crystal</a> programming language as a faster, type-checked alternative to Ruby. I really enjoyed the language and wanted to contribute and understand the code. I checked out their <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code></a> and it provided me with mostly a social / collaborative overview of where I can discuss issues or ideas, where I can ask questions, etc… What it did <strong>not</strong> provide was a <strong>technical</strong> overview of how the code is structured, the way it all comes together and its tech stack.</p>

<p>Putting this information would be helpful to not put off curious contributors that want to learn and develop a higher-level understanding of how the project works.</p>

<p>These frustrations are pushing me to propose a new “standard” for welcoming open source contribution, an <code>ARCHITECTURE.md</code> file, that would work on top of <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> to inform on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The tech stack, the backend / frontend / db / middleware technologies used</li>
  <li>The structure of the code and its logical links (diagrams :)), for example, crystal’s code is organised with <code>/src/modulename/submodule.cr</code> structure (for example <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/blob/master/src/csv/parser.cr"><code>/src/csv/parser.cr</code></a>), i.e. how does it all come together and what is the flow of the software. The <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/C4-architecture-model/">C4 model for software architecture</a> provide an instruction set for how engineers can use diagrams to easily explain their architecture.</li>
  <li>Specifications for testing and general guidelines on testing constraints for said project paired with details on the CI process.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s easy for the creators of a project to represent in their minds the way all the pieces of the project come together, but transcribing these pieces together into a document would be extremely beneficial, not only to teach others but also to clarify and renew one’s own understanding of their own code base.</p>

<p>If you have any other ideas for additional information it could contain, please comment! I think this could be incredibly useful in general to make access to open source projects easier and lower the learning curve.</p>
