				<p><a href="https://www.ams.org/images/Dist-Publ-Svc-2020-Eisenbud.jpg"><img alt="David Eisenbud" src="https://www.ams.org/images/thumbs/Dist-Publ-Svc-2020-Eisenbud.jpg"></a>The 2020 AMS Award for Distinguished Public Service will be presented to <strong>David Eisenbud</strong>, professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley and director of the Mathematical Research Institute (MSRI), for his exceptional leadership and outreach efforts while director of MSRI, president of the AMS, and director for Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the Simons Foundation.</p>

<ul>
	<li>As the long-time director of MSRI he has been instrumental in fostering or creating programs to enhance the public understanding of mathematics—for example, the Numberphile <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A">YouTube channel</a> and <a href="https://www.numberphile.com/podcast">podcast</a>, the <a href="http://www.mathicalbooks.org/">Mathical Book Prize</a>, the <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/mcl">National Math Circles Library</a>, the <a href="https://www.celebrationofmind.org/">Celebration of Mind events</a>, the <a href="https://www.nationalmathfestival.org/">National Math Festival</a>, and the initiation of the <a href="https://www.mathcircles.org/">National Math Circles organization</a>. He also brought a large and broad non-academic community of enthusiastic supporters to MSRI.</li>
	<li>As president of the AMS, he was an enthusiastic proponent of new outreach efforts, advocating for the <a href="https://www.ams.org/programs/research-communities/mrc">Mathematical Research Communities program</a> (MRC) as well as creating and sustaining the <a href="https://www.ams.org/meetings/lectures/current-events-bulletin">Current Events Bulletin sessions</a> at the Joint Mathematics Meetings.</li>
	<li>As the first director of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences division at the Simons Foundation, he was instrumental in forging policies that now provide significant and novel non-governmental support for the mathematical and physical sciences.</li>
	<li>As a research mathematician, Eisenbud's work is centered in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. He has advised more than 30 doctoral students, including 13 since first becoming director of MSRI. His book <em>Commutative Algebra: With a View Toward Algebraic Geometry</em> was honored with a Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition in 2010.</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of these roles, David Eisenbud has gone far beyond the ordinary as an exuberant advocate for the mathematical sciences. He has changed the way others think about our subject and changed aspects of the mathematics profession itself. His exceptional service will affect mathematics for years to come.</p>

<p><strong>Response of David Eisenbud</strong>:</p>

<p>I am very pleased by this recognition from the AMS for the work that I have had the good luck to be able to do on behalf of the mathematics community and of the public’s appreciation of the power, beauty and fun of mathematics!</p>

<p>Looking back, it seems to me that the mentoring I received played a great role both in my enthusiasm for this sort of work and for enabling me to take on the positions—principally at the AMS, at the Simons Foundation, and at MSRI—that have put me in a position to act on behalf of the community. These mentors in public service (and of course others, also in research) have played an enormous role in my life, one whose magnitude and coherence I only recently came to appreciate. I’m grateful for this chance to reflect on my path, and express my indebtedness to all of them. I can only wish such good fortune for others.</p>

<p><strong>Biographical Sketch of David Eisenbud</strong>:</p>

<p>David Eisenbud served as director of MSRI from 1997 to 2007, and began a new term in 2013. From 2009 to 2011, he served as director for Mathematical and the Physical Sciences at the Simons Foundation, and is currently on the foundation's Board of Directors.</p>

<p>He was president of the AMS from 2003 to 2005, and is a director of Math for America, a foundation devoted to improving mathematics teaching. He has been a member of the Board of Mathematical Sciences and their Applications of the National Research Council, and is a member of the U.S. National Committee of the International Mathematical Union. Eisenbud was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006, and was a member of the Inaugural Class of AMS Fellows (2013).</p>

<p>Eisenbud’s mathematical interests range widely over commutative and non-commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, topology, and computer methods. His interests outside of mathematics include theater, music, and juggling. He is co-author of a paper on the mathematics of juggling. He plays the flute and sings Bach, Brahms, Schubert, Schumann, … .</p>

<p><strong>About the Prize:</strong></p>

<p>Presented every two years, the AMS Award for Distinguished Public Service recognizes a research mathematician who has made recent or sustained distinguished contributions to the mathematics profession through public service. The 2020 award will be given Thursday, January 16 during the Joint Prize Session at the 2020 Joint Mathematics Meetings in Denver.</p>
