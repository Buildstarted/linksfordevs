<div>
          <p>I was recently made aware of the fact that in a <a href="https://github.com/scala/community-builds/commit/be8d3f07832c78044a65d3840a9338dc05943af7">single unreviewed commit</a>, ZIO and Scalaz were unilaterally removed from the community build.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, no explanation has been provided, just a commit message that I personally find quite cryptic (<em>CoC-incompatible</em> ?). Moreover, I cannot find any discussion of this decision, nor evidence that the decision comes from pre-existing policies and procedures, which has left me very confused about what is going on.</p>
<p>As someone who works on and recommends both Typelevel and Scalaz projects, and has worked toward a unified functional Scala community, I find this move quite disheartening.</p>
<p>I am very grateful for all the community build has done to improve stability of the Scala compiler, and I'm delighted that Typelevel projects are included in the build.</p>
<p>I believe that including Scalaz and ZIO in the build has tremendous value for the community, because these projects (mostly Scalaz) are widely deployed in industry; and both push the compiler in their own distinct ways, exploring different combinations of Scala features.</p>
<p>In light of all this, I would like to ask: <strong>What have ZIO or Scalaz done to get them removed from the community build?</strong></p>
<p>And more importantly: <em>how can we <strong>all</strong> work together to get them back on the community build, where they will help to ensure the stability of the Scala compiler, and benefit the entire Scala community?</em></p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration!</p>
