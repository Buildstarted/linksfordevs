<p>Since we are going to use a marking bitmap to track what objects are reachable, we need to clean it up before using it. Or, in this case, as we pursue the goal of never taking resources until the GC cycle hits, we need to <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1255908/Allocating-Memory-on-Linux-and-Windows">commit the bitmap to memory</a> first. This comes with a few interesting advantages, at least on Linux, where most of the bitmap would be mapped to zero page, especially for sparse heap.</p>
<p>Threads need to give up their TLABs and ask GC for new ones after GC finishes. <sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_2" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup></p>
<p>Some parts of runtime, especially those parts that deal with references to Java heap, get broken by GC, so we need to notify them that GC is about to act. This would let those subsystems to prepare/save parts of their state before impending GC moves.</p>

<h3 id="_marking"><a href="#_marking"></a>3.2. Marking</h3>
<p>Stop-the-world marking is quite simple once we have all the pieces ready to go. Marking is pretty generic, and it would normally be the first step in many GC implementations.</p>

<p>It is like every other graph walking problem: you start from the initial set of reachable vertices, walk all outbound edges, recording which vertices you visited, and do this until you run out of unvisited verticies. In GC, "vertexes" are the objects, and "edges" are the references between them.</p>
<p>Technically, we could have just used recursion to walk the object graph, but it is a bad idea for arbitrary graphs, which can have very large diameters. Think about walking the linked list with 1 billion nodes in it. So, to limit the recursion depth, we use marking stack that records objects discovered.</p>
<p>The initial set of reachable objects comes from GC roots. Don’t dwell on what <code>process_roots</code> does for now, we will visit it later. So far, assume it walks all references reachable from the VM side.</p>
<p>The marking bitmap serves both as the thing that tracks the <em>marking wavefront</em> (the set of already visited objects), and in the end gives us the desired output: the set of all reachable objects. The actual work in done in the <code>EpsilonScanOopClosure</code>,<sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_3" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup> that would be applied to all interesting objects, and which iterates all references in a given object, and here it is:</p>

<p>The only wrinkle here is that we store the new addresses in the mark words of the Java objects, and these mark words could be busy with something else, for example, locking information. Luckily, those non-trivial mark words are rare, and we can just store them separately if needed: that is what <code>PreservedMarks</code> would do for us.</p>

<p>There are two sets of references to our moved objects; from other objects in the heap itself and from the GC roots. We need to update both. Some preserved marks have recorded the object references too, so we need to ask them to update themselves. <code>PreservedMarks</code> knows what to do, because it expects "forwarding data" in the same location we have recorded it at, in object mark word.</p>
<p>The closures are now coming in two types: one that accepts the objects and walks its contents, and the other one that updates the locations. Here is a little performance optimization: if an object is not forwarded, it does not move, so we can spare quite a few heap writes:</p>

<p>After this step is done, the heap is basically corrupted: references point to "wrong" locations, where objects have not been moved yet. Let’s rectify that!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_moving_the_objects"><a href="#_moving_the_objects"></a>3.5. Moving The Objects</h3>
<p>Time to move the objects into their new locations, as per algorithm step:</p>
<p><span><img src="https://shipilev.net/jvm/diy-gc/move-objects.jpg" alt="move objects"></span></p>
<p>Walk the heap again and apply the <code>EpsilonMoveObjectsObjectClosure</code> closure to all live objects:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>GCTraceTime</span><span>(</span><span>Info</span><span>,</span><span> gc</span><span>)</span><span> time</span><span>(</span><span>"Step 4: Move objects"</span><span>,</span><span> NULL</span><span>);</span><span>

  </span><span>// Move all alive objects to their new locations. All the references are</span><span>
  </span><span>// already adjusted at previous step.</span><span>
  </span><span>EpsilonMoveObjectsObjectClosure</span><span> cl</span><span>;</span><span>
  walk_bitmap</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>cl</span><span>);</span><span>
  stat_moved </span><span>=</span><span> cl</span><span>.</span><span>moved</span><span>();</span><span>

  </span><span>// Now we moved all objects to their relevant locations, we can retract</span><span>
  </span><span>// the "top" of the allocation space to the end of the compacted prefix.</span><span>
  _space</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>set_top</span><span>(</span><span>new_top</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>After this is done, we can retract the allocated space to the compaction point, letting the allocation path allocate from there after GC cycle is over.</p>
<p>Note that sliding GC means we can <em>overwrite</em> the contents of existing objects, but since we are scanning in one direction, that means the object we are overwriting is already copied out to its proper location. <sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_4" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup> So, the closure itself just moves the forwarded objects to their new locations:</p>

<p>Notify other parts of runtime to make their post-GC cleanups/fixups. Restore the special mark words we saved before. Kiss the marking bitmap bye-bye, we do not need it anymore.</p>
<p>And, if we are so inclined, we can retract the committed space to the new allocation point, thus returning memory to the OS!</p>
