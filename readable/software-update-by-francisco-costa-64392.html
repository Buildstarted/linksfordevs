<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Software Update</p><p><span>It was as if a balloon inflated in my throat</span>. I clenched my abdomen, squinted my eyes, and jutted my jaw forward—all in an attempt to wring out the words on the page. Nothing came. My classmates looked at me, perplexed.</p><p>My mom tells me it started in kindergarten, but it’s that memory from a reading assignment in fifth grade that stands out to me. I remember struggling to introduce myself, not raising my hand in class when I knew the answer, ordering the wrong item on the menu, pretending to miss phone calls, and <span>allowing strangers to finish my sentences</span>.</p><p>My dad stuttered too, but only occasionally and had no shame around it. This meant that at home this wasn’t seen as a problem, but simply a quirk. <span>I wasn’t rushed into speech therapy, prescribed medication, or given any excuses</span>. The medical literature I could get my hands on at school backed my parents’ view: no known cause, no magic-bullet. This was a battle I had to fight on my own and <span>I was convinced of a future where speaking would be my superpower</span>.</p><p>So I searched. <span>I searched in my surroundings, in books, and on the internet for stories through which to view my own experience</span>. I immersed myself in the words of Demosthenes, one of Ancient Greece’s greatest orators, who stuttered. I studied the work of Jill Bolte Taylor, a neuroanatomist who documented her own journey after suffering a stroke. I learned about Barbara Arrowsmith-Young, a psychologist who showed the plasticity of the brain by teaching her own learning-disabled brain to read and tell time. <span>I filled my mouth with pebbles to connect with the physical experience of speaking</span>, I read out loud every night in front of the mirror, training with the discipline of an athlete and the flow of a musician. </p><p>Stories from around the world were giving me the means to transcend my own. <span>I was learning that the brain can surprise us despite our most advanced explanations of it</span>.</p><p>At 19, I had my first breakthrough. In making intentional eye contact in conversation, <span>I discovered a state of presence, an ability to focus with clarity—much like an athlete</span>. My brain settled and the figment of an image appeared in my mind—that <em>image</em> represented what I wanted to say. Words came out and a new image appeared.</p><p>That was the first time I spoke without interruption, blockage, or exchanged words in order to avoid a stutter. In the years that followed, I used every opportunity I had to harness this presence. I chased interactions with strangers, friends, and family. Over time, speaking became my power. In conversation, I found the freedom to express myself. <span>My best thoughts, ideas and breakthroughs now come through speech and, a decade after that first experience, I'm still puzzled by how it all works</span>. I hiccup here and there but these days I'm mostly fluent – and no, I won't glare at you mid-conversation!</p><p><span>My stutter shaped me greatly. It made me a seeker of knowledge</span>, a believer in the power of understanding the stories and perspectives of others by learning about the world through their eyes.</p><p>Today, <span>I see that we view everything through story</span>. Who we are; what we can and can't do; the culture, religion, and nation into which we are born; what happens in the world and the vast universe of which we are made. My experience has shown me that these <span>stories are like software for the brain – we run on them</span>. Software that can help us make great progress, wreak havoc, and software that should often be revised and upgraded.</p></div></div></div>
