do not reply directly to a suspicious email.<br>• Check for misspellings or wrong domains within a link (e.g., if an address that should end in “.gov” ends in “.com” instead).<br>• Do not trust a website just because it has a lock icon or “https” in the browser address bar.</p><h2>Abusing cloud companies' TLS certificates</h2><p>While in&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of cases bad actors will get their own SSL certificates to secure pages&nbsp;used in their campaigns to try and trick their targets, there is also a lot of them who just abuse pages hosted on cloud services which automatically inherit the certificates.</p><p>For instance, during the last two months, crooks have been observed while hosting malware and command-and-control servers on Microsoft’s Azure cloud services as well as websites used to deliver tech support scams.</p><p>As security researcher MalwareHunterTeam&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1129005770354380800" target="_blank">said</a> on Twitter, "the amount of lawyers through gov officials through bank employees through AP accountants/analysts/coordinators through everything getting phished using MS hosted phishing pages is totally out of control."</p><p>During February, researchers also found that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/outlook-and-microsoft-account-phishing-emails-utilize-azure-blob-storage/" target="_blank">phishing campaigns used Microsoft's Azure Blob Storage</a>&nbsp;to steal recipient's Microsoft account and Outlook&nbsp;credentials&nbsp;utilizing&nbsp;convincing landing pages secured with the windows.net domain's&nbsp;SSL certificates&nbsp;to appear legitimate.</p><p>Two months later, MinervaLabs' malware researcher Omri Segev Moyal&nbsp;shared with BleepingComputer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/office-365-custom-rules-to-block-azure-blob-storage-phishing-attacks/" target="_blank">custom Office 365 rules</a> which can be used to block phishing attacks that make use of Microsoft's Azure Blob Storage for hosting their landing pages to take advantage of windows.net subdomains' valid Microsoft SSL certificates.</p><p>It's not only Microsoft's cloud services being abused by cyber-criminals to make their malicious web pages look legitimate given that&nbsp;a phishing campaign which attempted to steal Google and Facebook credentials has been discovered in Early-February <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-phishing-attack-uses-google-translate-as-camouflage/" target="_blank">utilizing Google Translate as camouflage</a>.</p><p>Also,&nbsp;Cloudflare's&nbsp;IPFS gateway was also abused by crooks to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-attacks-distributed-through-cloudflares-ipfs-gateway/" target="_blank">secure their phishing scams</a>&nbsp;using TLS certificates issued by CloudFlare.</p></div></div></div></div>
