Rust is designed for writing and maintaining fast, reliable, and efficient code. It has seen considerable uptake since its first stable release four years ago, with companies like <a href="https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/">Google</a>, <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/01/fearless-security-memory-safety/">Mozilla</a> all using Rust. Rust has also seen lots of growth in AWS, with services such as Lambda, EC2, and S3 all choosing to use Rust in performance-sensitive components. We&#x2019;ve even open sourced the <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io">Firecracker microVM</a> project!</p> <h2>Why Rust?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/#language-values">In the words</a> of the Rust project&#x2019;s maintainers:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Performance</strong>. Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.</li> <li><strong>Reliability</strong>. Rust&#x2019;s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety &#x2014; and enable you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.</li> <li><strong>Productivity</strong>. Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling &#x2014; an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>With its <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/community#conduct">inclusive community</a> and top-notch libraries like:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://serde.rs/">Serde</a>, for serializing and deserializing data.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">Rayon</a>, for writing parallel &amp; data race-free code.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio">Tokio</a>/<a href="https://github.com/async-rs/async-std">async-std</a>, for writing non-blocking, low-latency network services.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing">tracing</a>, for instrumenting Rust programs to collect structured, event-based diagnostic information.</li> </ul> <p>&#x2026;it&#x2019;ll come as no surprise that Rust was voted <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages">Stack Overflow&#x2019;s &#x201C;Most Loved Language&#x201D; four years running</a>.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s why AWS is sponsoring the Rust project. The Rust project uses AWS services to:</p> <ul> <li>Store release artifacts such as compilers, libraries, tools, and source code on S3.</li> <li>Run ecosystem-wide regression tests with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crater">Crater</a> on EC2.</li> <li>Operate <a href="https://docs.rs">docs.rs</a>, a website that hosts documentation for all packages published to the central <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> package registry.</li> </ul> <h2>Getting started with Rust</h2> <p>To get started with the Rust programming language, check out Rust&#x2019;s &#x201C;<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn">Getting Started</a>&#x201D; page. To get started with Rust on AWS, consider using <a href="https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto">Rusoto</a>, a community-driven AWS SDK. To use Rust on AWS Lambda, consider using the official <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/rust-runtime-for-aws-lambda/">AWS Lambda Runtime for Rust</a>.</p> <p>While we&#x2019;re using Rust, we&#x2019;re especially excited to see how it develops and what the broader community builds with Rust. We can&#x2019;t wait to be an even bigger part of the Rust community.</p> <p><strong>ps</strong> &#x2013; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-promotional-credits-open-source-projects/">AWS credits are available for other open source projects!</a></p> </section> <footer> <div class="blog-author-box"> <div class="blog-author-image"> <img alt="David Barsky" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2019/09/19/me.jpg" width="125"> </div> <p>David Barsky is an engineer at Amazon.
