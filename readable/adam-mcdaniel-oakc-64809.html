<h2>Why Oak?</h2>
<p>For those of you that remember <a href="https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/free">"free"</a>, oak is essentially a more robust and high level version of that project. The goal of oak is to be as high level as possible in the frontend, but as small and low level as possible in the backend.</p>

<h2>Intermediate Representation</h2>
<p>The key to oak's insane portability is its incredibly compact backend implementation. <em>The code for Oak's backend can be expressed in under 100 lines of C.</em> Such a small implementation is only possible because of the tiny instruction set of the intermediate representation. Oak's IR is only composed of <strong><em>13 different instructions</em></strong>. That's on par with <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" rel="nofollow">brainfuck</a>!</p>
<p>The backend of oak functions very simply. Every instruction operates on a <em>memory tape</em>. This tape is essentially a static array of double-precision floats.</p>

                          <span>`current location of the stack pointer`</span></pre></div>
<p>When a variable is defined, it's given a static location on the memory tape. Then, the compiler just replaces the variable with its address in the rest of the code!</p>
<p>Additionally, the memory tape functions as a <strong><em>stack</em></strong> and a <strong><em>heap</em></strong>. After space for all of the program's variables is assigned, the memory used for the stack begins. The stack <em>grows</em> and <em>shrinks</em> with data throughout the program: when two numbers are summed, for example, they are popped off of the stack and replaced with the result. Similarly, the heap grows and shrinks throughout the program. The heap, however, is used for <em>dynamically allocated</em> data: information with a memory footprint <strong>unknown at compile time</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that you understand how oak's backend fundamentally operates, here's the complete instruction set!</p>

<p>Using only these instructions, oak is able to implement <em><strong>even higher level abstractions than C can offer</strong></em>!!! That might not sound like much, but it's very powerful for a language this small.</p>
<h2>Compilation Process</h2>
<p>So how exactly does the oak compiler work?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Flatten structures into their functions</p>
<ul>
<li>Structures in oak work differently than in other languages. The objects themselves are only arrays of memory cells: they don't have <em><strong>any</strong></em> members or attributes. Structures <em>exclusively</em> retrieve their data by using <strong><em>methods</em></strong> to return the addresses of their <em>"members"</em>. These methods are then flattened into simple functions. So, <em><code>putnumln(*bday.day)</code></em> becomes <em><code>putnumln(*Date::day(&amp;bday))</code></em>. This is a pretty simple process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the size of every operation's type</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of the structure of oak's intermediate representation, the type of every expression must be known for compilation to continue. The compiler combs over each expression and find's the size of its type. From here on, the representation of the code looks like this:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><span>// `3` is the size of the structure on the stack</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>Date</span>::new(month: 1, day: 1, year: 1) -&gt; 3 {
    month; day; year
}
<span>// self is a pointer to an item of size `3`</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>Date</span>::day(<span>self</span>: <span>&amp;</span>3) -&gt; <span>&amp;</span>1 { <span>self</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> }

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() -&gt; 0 {
    <span>let</span> bday: <span>3</span> <span>=</span> Date<span>::</span><span>new</span>(<span>5</span>, <span>14</span>, <span>2002</span>);
}</pre></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Statically compute the program's memory footprint</p>
<ul>
<li>After totalling all the statically allocated data, such as the overall memory size of variables and string literals, the program preemptively sets aside the proper amount of memory on the stack. This essentially means that the stack pointer is <em>immediately</em> moved to make room for all the data at the start of the program.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert Oak expressions and statements into equivalent IR instructions</p>
<ul>
<li>Most expressions are pretty straightforward: function calls simply push their arguments onto the stack in reverse order and call a function by it's ID, references to a variable just push their assigned location on the stack as a number, and so on. Method calls, <em>however</em>, are a bit tricky.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <strong><em>many</em></strong> different circumstances where a method call is valid. Methods <em><strong>always take a pointer to the structure as an argument</strong></em>. However, <em>an object that calls a method is not required to be a pointer</em>. For example, the following code is valid: <em><code>let bday: Date = Date::new(); bday.print();</code></em>. The variable <code>bday</code> is not a pointer, yet the method <em><code>.print()</code></em> can still be used. Here's why.</p>
<p>When the compiler sees a flattened method call, it needs to find a way to transform the "instance expression" into a pointer. For variables, this is easy: just add a reference! For instance expressions that are already pointers, it's even easier: don't do anything! For any other kind of expression, though, it's a bit more verbose. The compiler sneaks in a hidden variable to store the expression, and then compiles the method call again using the variable as the instance expression. Pretty cool, right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assemble the IR instructions for a target</p>
<ul>
<li>Because oak's IR is so small, it can support several targets. Even better, adding a target is incredibly easy. In oak's crate, there's a trait named <code>Target</code>. If you implement each of the IR's instructions for your language using the <code>Target</code> trait, then oak can automatically compile all the way down to your new programming or assembly language! <em>Yes, it's as easy as it sounds!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Syntax and Flags</h2>
<p>The syntax of oak is heavily inspired by the Rust programming language.</p>
<div><pre><span>// Flag to include another file in this directory</span>
<span>// If this file contains a "main" method, it will be overridden.</span>
#[include(<span>"str.ok"</span>)]

<span>// An optional flag to set the exact number of memory cells to use for the heap.</span>
<span>// This makes Oak an extremely suitable language for embedded development!</span>
#[heap(128)]

    fn not(self: <span>&amp;</span><span>bool</span>) -&gt; <span>bool</span> {
        if <span>*</span>self { <span>bool</span>::false() }

    <span>// Allocate 32 cells</span>
    <span>let</span> addr: <span>&amp;</span><span>char</span> <span>=</span> <span>alloc</span>(size);
    <span>// Free those 32 cells</span>
    free addr: size;
}


<span>fn</span> <span>putbool</span>(b: <span>bool</span>) {
    <span>if</span> b { <span>putstr</span>(<span>"true"</span>) }
    <span>else</span> { <span>putstr</span>(<span>"false"</span>) }
}

<span>fn</span> <span>putboolln</span>(b: <span>bool</span>) {
    <span>putbool</span>(b); <span>putchar</span>(<span>'
'</span>);
}

<span>// Functions can be ordered independently</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>square</span>(x: num) -&gt; num {
    <span>putstr</span>(<span>"Squaring the number '"</span>); <span>putnum</span>(x); <span>putcharln</span>(<span>'''</span>);
    <span>// The last statement in a body doesn't require brackets</span>
    x <span>*</span> x

<p>Lastly, in the entry point, our <code>fact</code> function is called with the argument <code>5</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span>void</span> <span>fn1</span>(machine* vm) {
    <span>machine_push</span>(vm, <span>5</span>);
    <span>fn0</span>(vm);
    <span><span>//</span> print the result of `fact(5)`</span>
    <span>prn</span>(vm);
}</pre></div>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The best way to install Oak is with the Rust package manager.</p>
<div><pre><span><span>#</span> Also works for updating oakc</span>
cargo install -f oakc</pre></div>
<p>Then, oak files can be compiled with the oakc binary.</p>
<div><pre>oak -c examples/hello_world.ok
main.exe</pre></div>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p><strong>C backend</strong>
- Any GCC compiler that supports C99</p>
<p><strong>Go backend</strong>
- Golang 1.14 compiler</p>
