"They told me to take up a sport and that the kids playing basketball and stuff were gonna be way more successful than us&nbsp;nerds who played Counter-Strike at LAN parties every weekend."</p><p>"They all laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now?"</p><p>To prepare for the onslaught of the deadly disease, nerds are changing absolutely nothing and are expected to rise up to rule the post-Coronavirus society, as they are the ones best adjusted to being sheltered in a basement, garage, or room for many days at a time marathoning&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>,&nbsp;<em>Half-Life</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>,&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption,</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. They're also ready for any post-apocalyptic wasteland, as they've played many, many hours of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>and are adept at&nbsp;killing bloatflies and collecting bottlecaps.</p><p>Of course, many nerds are running out of hygienic&nbsp;products, but they say that's "not an issue."</p>   <div><div><div><h3>Breaking: Paypal Now Available</h3> <p>Many of you told us you wouldn't subscribe until we offered Paypal as a payment option. You apparently weren't bluffing, so we finally caved and added Paypal. Now — like the unbeliever faced with God's invisible qualities displayed in nature — you are without excuse.</p></div> <div><p><img src="https://babylonbee.com/img/logo.png"></p><div> <p><img src="https://babylonbee.com/img/paypal.png"></p></div></div></div></div>   </div></div></div>
