They solve the problem of how to have an application work consistently regardless of the environment it is run on. This is achieved by bundling the whole runtime environment - the application, it's dependancies, configuration files, etc... Into a single <em>image</em>. This image can then be shared and instances of it, known as <em>containers</em>, can then be run. &nbsp;</p><p>In this post, I'm going to show you how to run a Blazor Server application in a container. We're going to have a look at how to create images and from there how to create containers.</p><blockquote>All the code for this post is <a href="https://github.com/chrissainty/BlazorServerWithDocker">available on GitHub</a>.</blockquote><p>Before we get into things, let's cover what Docker is and a few key concepts. </p><h2 id="what-is-docker">What is Docker?</h2><p>Docker is a platform which provides services and tools to allow the building, sharing and running of containers. These containers are isolated from one another but run on a shared OS kernel, making them far more lightweight than virtual machines. This allows more containers to be run on the same physical hardware giving containers an advantage over traditional virtual machines.</p><p>As containers only contain what is needed to run the application it makes them extremely quick to spin up. This makes them exceptionally good at scaling on demand. Where a traditional VM would need a few minutes before additional capacity comes online, a container can be started in a few fractions of a second.</p><h3 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h3><p>You can think of a dockerfile as a blueprint which contains all the commands, in order, needed to create an <em>image</em> of your application. Docker images are created by running the <code>docker build</code> command against a dockerfile. </p><h3 id="image">Image</h3><p>Docker images are the result of running a dockerfile. Images are built up in layers, just like an onion, and each layer can also be cached to help speed up build times. Images are immutable once created, but they can be used as base images in a dockerfile to allow customisation. Images can be stored in an image repository such as <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/container-registry/">Azure Container Registry</a> - think NuGet but for containers - which allows them to be shared with others. </p><h3 id="container">Container</h3><p>A container is an instance of an image. You can spin up many containers from a single image. They're started by using the <code>docker run</code> command and specifying the image to use to create the container.</p><h2 id="containerising-a-blazor-server-app">Containerising a Blazor Server App</h2><h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3><p>If you've not done any work with Docker before you will need to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/">Docker Desktop for Windows</a> or <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/">Docker Desktop for Mac</a>. Just follow the setup instructions and you will be up and running in a couple of minutes. For the purpose of this post we're going to be using the default project template for a Blazor Server app.</p><h3 id="creating-a-dockerfile">Creating a Dockerfile</h3><p>The first thing we're going to do is create a dockerfile in the root of the project. If you're using something other than Visual Studio, such as VS Code then just create a new file in the root of your project called <code>dockerfile</code> with no extension and paste in the code from a bit further down. </p><p>If you're using Visual Studio then right click on your project and select <strong>Add</strong> &gt; <strong>Docker Support...</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://chrissainty.com/content/images/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-20-at-16.13.06.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>You will then be asked what target OS you want.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://chrissainty.com/content/images/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-20-at-16.17.10.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>I'm choosing Linux as I'm on a Mac anyway plus hosting is cheaper when I want to push this to Azure. If your application does require something Windows specific then make sure to chose Windows here. Once you're done then click <strong>OK</strong>. After a few seconds you should see a <em>Dockerfile</em> appear in the root of the project.</p><p><strong>A word of warning here -</strong> I've found this file doesn't always seem to work properly. It seems to expect a certain folder structure where the <em>dockerfile</em> is one level higher than the project, if that's not the case then things won't work. Below is a version of the dockerfile after a couple of modifications to remove the folder structure assumption.</p><pre><code class="language-dockerfile">FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.0-buster-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.0-buster AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY BlazorServerWithDocker.csproj .
RUN dotnet restore "BlazorServerWithDocker.csproj"
COPY . .
RUN dotnet build "BlazorServerWithDocker.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "BlazorServerWithDocker.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "BlazorServerWithDocker.dll"]
</code></pre><p>You can see that there is a repeating pattern, each section starts using the <code>FROM</code> keyword. As I mentioned earlier, images are like onions, they're built up with lots of layers, one on top of the other. Let's break this all down to understand what each step is doing.</p><pre><code class="language-dockerfile">FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.0-buster-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443
</code></pre><p>The first section defines the base image that we're going to use to create our applications image, although we're not actually going to use it till the end. It's provided by Microsoft and contains just the .NET Core runtime. We're setting the working directory to be <code>app</code> and exposing ports <code>80</code> and <code>443</code> which are the ports the container will listen on at runtime. We'll come back to this one at the end.</p><pre><code class="language-dockerfile">FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.0-buster AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY BlazorServerWithDocker.csproj .
RUN dotnet restore "BlazorServerWithDocker.csproj"
COPY . .
RUN dotnet build "BlazorServerWithDocker.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build
</code></pre><p>The next section is responsible for building the application. This is based on another image provided by Microsoft which contains the full .NET Core SDK. The <code>WORKDIR</code> command sets the working directory inside the container - any actions will now be relative to that directory. </p><p>We <code>COPY</code> the <code>csproj</code> from our project to the containers working directory, then run a <code>dotnet restore</code>. After that the <code>COPY</code> command copies over all the other files in the project to the working directory before running a <code>dotnet build</code> in release configuration.</p><pre><code class="language-dockerfile">FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "BlazorServerWithDocker.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish
</code></pre><p>This section publishes our app. Here we're specifying the previous build image as the base for this layer, then calling <code>dotnet publish</code>. </p><pre><code class="language-dockerfile">FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "BlazorServerWithDocker.dll"]
</code></pre><p>The last section is what creates our final image. Here you can see we're using the <code>base</code> image from the start of the file, which was the .NET Core runtime image. We set the <code>WORKDIR</code> to <code>app</code> then copy over the published files from the previous publish layer. Finally, we set the entry point for the application. This is the instruction that tells the image how to start the process it will run for us.</p><h3 id="building-an-image">Building an Image</h3><p>Now we have a dockerfile which defines our image we need to use a docker command to actually create it.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">docker build -t blazor-server-with-docker .
</code></pre><p>The <code>-t</code> switch tells docker to tag the image with <code>blazor-server-with-docker</code> which is useful for identifying the image later on. The dot (.) at the end tells docker to look for the dockerfile in the current directory. </p><p>This is the output when the command is run.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">Sending build context to Docker daemon  1.384MB

</code></pre><p>As you can see each step in the dockerfile is executed in order and intermediate images are created and removed along the way until the final image is built and tagged. </p><p>Another great thing about Docker is it's really efficient when building images. It caches each layer so future builds can be sped up.

</code></pre><p>As nothing has changed Docker has used the cached version of all the images used during the first build, resulting in a near instant build.</p><h3 id="starting-a-container">Starting a container</h3><p>All that's left now is to start an instance of our new image and make sure everything works. We can start a new container using the <code>docker run</code> command.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">docker run -p 8080:80 blazor-server-with-docker
</code></pre><p>The <code>-p</code> switch tell docker to map port <code>8080</code> on the host machine to port <code>80</code> on the container. Earlier, we used the <code>EXPOSE</code> keyword when creating the image to define which ports our container would listen on, this is where it comes into play. Also having tagged our image has made things much simpler here, we can just use the tag name to specify the image rather than its GUID.</p><p>If all goes well you should see something like this.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://chrissainty.com/content/images/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-20-at-19.51.45.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>Open a browser and go to <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> and you should see the app load.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://chrissainty.com/content/images/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-20-at-19.53.41.png" class="kg-image"></figure><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>In this post, we've looked at what Docker and containers are as well as what benefits they offer over more traditional virtual machines. As well as covering some of the core concepts in Docker. We then used the standard Blazor Server App template to build a Docker <em>image</em> by adding and configuring a <em>dockerfile</em>. Finally we used that image to create a <em>container</em> which ran our Blazor Server application.</p><p>Next time we'll look at how we can do the same thing with a Blazor WebAssembly application.</p><hr><hr></div></div></div></div>
