    <h1>These Legit-Looking iPhone Lightning Cables Will Hijack Your Computer</h1>
    <div class="article__body article__body dsp-block-xx ff--body-article size--article lh--body"><p> I plugged the Apple lightning cable into my iPod and connected it to my Mac, just as I normally would. My iPod started charging, iTunes detected the device, and my iPod produced the pop-up asking if I wanted to trust this computer. All expected behaviour.</p> <p> But this cable was hiding a secret. A short while later, a hacker remotely opened a terminal on my Mac&apos;s screen, letting them run commands on my computer as they saw fit. This is because this wasn&apos;t a regular cable. Instead, it had been modified to include an implant; extra components placed inside the cable letting the hacker remotely connect to the computer.</p> <p> &quot;It looks like a legitimate cable and works just like one. Not even your computer will notice a difference. Until I, as an attacker, wirelessly take control of the cable,&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/_MG_">the security researcher known as MG</a> who made these cables told Motherboard after he showed me how it works at the annual Def Con hacking conference.</p> <p> One idea is to take this malicious tool, dubbed O.MG Cable, and swap it for a target&apos;s legitimate one. MG suggested you may even give the malicious version as a gift to the target&#x2014;the cables even come with some of the correct little pieces of packaging holding them together.</p> <p> MG typed in the IP address of the fake cable on his own phone&apos;s browser, and was presented with a list of options, such as opening a terminal on my Mac. From here, a hacker can run all sorts of tools on the victim&apos;s computer.</p> <p> &quot;It&#x2019;s like being able to sit at the keyboard and mouse of the victim but without actually being there,&quot; MG said. </p> <p> The cable comes with various payloads, or scripts and commands that an attacker can run on the victim&apos;s machine. A hacker can also remotely &quot;kill&quot; the USB implant, hopefully hiding some evidence of its use or existence.</p> <p> MG made the cables by hand, painstakingly modifying real Apple cables to include the implant.</p> <p> &quot;In the end, I was able to create 100 percent of the implant in my kitchen and then integrate it into a cable. And these prototypes at Def con were mostly done the same way,&quot; he said. MG did point to other researchers <a href="https://twitter.com/d3d0c3d">who worked on the implant</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/clevernyyyy">and graphical user interface</a>. He is selling the cables for $200 each.</p> <p> In the test with Motherboard, MG connected his phone to a wifi hotspot emanating out of the malicious cable in order to start messing with the target Mac itself.</p><p class="article__blockquote"> <b><i> See anything else worth reporting at Def con? We&apos;d love to hear from you. You can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, OTR chat on jfcox@jabber.ccc.de, or email joseph.cox@vice.com.</i></b></p><p>&quot;I&#x2019;m currently seeing up to 300 feet with a smartphone when connecting directly,&quot; he said, when asked how close an attacker needs to be to take advantage of the cable once a victim has plugged it into their machine. A hacker could use a stronger antenna to reach further if necessary, &quot;But the cable can be configured to act as a client to a nearby wireless network. And if that wireless network has an internet connection, the distance basically becomes unlimited.&quot; he added.<br></p> <p> Now MG wants to get the cables produced as a legitimate security tool; he said the company <a href="https://shop.hak5.org/">Hak5</a> is onboard with making that happen. These cables would be made from scratch rather than modified Apple ones, MG said. </p> <p> MG added, &quot;Apple cables are simply the most difficult to do this to, so if I can successfully implant one of these, then I can usually do it to other cables.&quot;</p><p><b> <i> Subscribe to our new cybersecurity podcast, </i></b><b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/cyber/id1441708044?mt=2"><i>CYBER</i></a>.</b></p></div>
