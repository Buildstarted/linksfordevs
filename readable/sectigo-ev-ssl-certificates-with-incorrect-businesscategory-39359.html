<p>At 5:18pm BST Oct 22, 2019 we received a report to our problem reporting email address as follows</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has been a number of EV certs with businessCategory being "Non-Commercial Entity" despite not being intergovernmental organization as specified by 8.5.5. of the CA/Browser Forum EV Guidelines.<br>
I have listed a few certificates below that I believe will illustrate the issue.<br>

<li>Whether your CA has stopped, or has not yet stopped, issuing certificates with the problem. A statement that you have will be considered a pledge to the community; a statement that you have not requires an explanation.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have stopped issuing certificates with this problem.</p>
<p>Although changes made to our 2nd approval validation step as a result of the response to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1575022" title="ASSIGNED - Sectigo: EV SSL Certificates with incorrect subject details.">Bug 1575022</a> had prevented this error from occurring in recently validated subjects, we had to put additional measures in place to ensure that no new certificates were issued with this problem as a result of the activity of EV Enterprise RAs.<br>
The additional threat around the EV Enterprise RAs is that section 14.2.2 (paraphrasing) permits further EV certificates to be issued for the enterprise without the subject validation being repeated every time (limited by the 'Age of Validated Data' stipulations of 11.14.3) and without 2nd approval.  The risk was that a previously mis-validated subject could have led to the issuance of a further certificate including the mis-validated subject even after we were aware of the issue and had reinforced our subject validation and 2nd approval processes.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>A summary of the problematic certificates. For each problem: number of certs, and the date the first and last certs with that problem were issued.</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem here is that some EV certificate subjects incorrectly show a subject:businessCategory of 'Non-Commercial Entity'.<br>
4 certificates were included in the problem report.<br>
Of those 4, the earliest was issued on Feb 19, 2019, and the latest on Apr 4, 2019.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The complete certificate data for the problematic certificates. The recommended way to provide this is to ensure each certificate is logged to CT and then list the fingerprints or crt.sh IDs, either in the report or as an attached spreadsheet, with one list per distinct problem.</li>

<li>Explanation about how and why the mistakes were made or bugs introduced, and how they avoided detection until now.</li>
</ol>
<p>a) Some of our validation staff had a mistaken understanding of the nature of the 'Non-Commercial entity' as per section 8.5.5 of the EV Guidelines.</p>
<p>b) Our 2nd approval validators were not as effective as they should have been prior to the corrective steps discussed in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1575022#c1">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1575022#c1</a></p>
<p>c) Self audit had not seen an example of the mistake. Non-commercial Entities are in the small minority in our body of issued EV certifcates, even including those mistakenly identified as such.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>List of steps your CA is taking to resolve the situation and ensure such issuance will not be repeated in the future, accompanied with a timeline of when your CA expects to accomplish these things.</li>
</ol>
<p>a) For our staff having a mistaken understanding of the concept of Non-Commercial entities, the solution is training.  Our training program had evidently not concentrated on this important area sufficiently.<br>
We have revised the training material to expand upon the nature of Non-Commercial entities (as per EVGL 8.5.5) and to specifically call out the differences and the risk of confusion between Non-Commercial in the EVGL sense and Non-Profit or Charity.<br>
We have undertaken remedial training on this issue with all of our validation staff.</p>
<p>b) We significantly reorganized our 2nd approval (aka “Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence”) teams as described in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1575022#c1">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1575022#c1</a></p>
<p>c) We have under review whether and how to include additional non-randomly selected samples into our regular self audit process.  We can include examples to provide greater scrutiny over issues, such as this, where subject validation mistakes have been made.<br>
This is not really part of the EVGL-mandated self-audit, but points to the advantages of further and continuous self-audit and will probably run alongside the EVGL-mandated self audit.</p>
<p>d) We note that the EVGLs call out that "The CA/Browser Forum may publish a listing of Applicants who qualify as an International Organization for EV eligibility" and we like the idea.  We will start to build a list of the Non-Commercial entities that we have encountered and will publish it as a starting point.  I do not yet have a target publication date.</p>
<p>e) Our  examination and reverification of the body of issued EV certificates with businessCategory "Non-Commercial Entity" is almost complete and we expect to publish the list on Sunday November 3rd.</p>
