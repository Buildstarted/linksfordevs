 <h6>Description</h6>
<p>Security is an essential part of everyday life, from how you create accounts on websites, to how you use your mobile devices, to the activities you perform behind the corporate firewall. However, major information security incidents have become an everyday occurrence that are only growing in scale and impact. This course, The Information Security Big Picture, presents a raft of security fundamentals and sets forth to distill many of the common myths people believe in that frequently put them at greater risk. You'll start by looking at some of the problems we're facing in the industry and why everyone needs to have the security discussion. You'll then go over some of the misconceptions that tend to be repeated time and time again. You'll also go over some of the problems with passwords, how you can mitigate the risks and what long-accepted password "truth" is now being approached differently. After completing this evidence-based approach to security, you should have a firm grasp of the essentials of infosec today.</p>

<p><span>Course Overview</span><br>Hi, this is Troy Hunt and welcome to the Information Security Big Picture. I am a Microsoft Regional Director MVP and very frequent Pluralsight author from my home here in Australia. We have a security problem, a big one and a lot of this is because we just don't get many of the fundamental principles that are essential to working with modern day connected systems. For example, we assume that just because our organization has a corporate firewall, that everything behind it is safe, but it's not and in fact very frequently there are already attackers inside the network, but this course isn't just about networks and firewalls, it's about all sort of aspects of security we frequently just don't get right. We make incorrect trust assumptions about which sites are safe and which ones are dangerous. We believe that antivirus will protect us from malware, when it simply can't keep up. Even the security principles we've believed for so long are adapting. We are now being told not to force regular password changes. This course dispels many of the myths about information security. It looks at what's happening in the real world, what the evidence tells us about security. It's a big picture course too, so it can be consumed by anyone regardless of their technical depths. I really enjoyed creating this course, especially dispelling some of the myths about security and I really hope you enjoy watching it.</p>
