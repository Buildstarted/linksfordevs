First formed as a conference in 2005, DDD has generated many spin-offs across the UK and the world, as far afield as Melbourne and Perth. </p> <p> The conference is envisioned as a day of learning, discussion, contribution and involvement in the community, from across the UK. Its goal is to provide free technical education, with the added benefit of the networking possibilities with peers and the development of relationships across the .NET Industry! During it&#x2019;s more than 10-year history, it has nurtured talented speakers, who have gone on to become Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals, Microsoft FTEs and to present at National and International Conferences. </p> <p> Once again this year, on Saturday 12th October, DDD will be returning to it birthplace in Reading at Thames Valley Park! </p> </article> <article id="Photos"> </article> </div>
