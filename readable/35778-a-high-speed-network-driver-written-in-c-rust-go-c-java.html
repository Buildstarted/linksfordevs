Here, the batch size matters; small batches have a lower packet rate across the board. Each language has increasing throughput with increasing batch size up to some point, and then the chart goes flat.
Python is by far the slowest, not even diverging from the zero line. 
C is consistently the fastest, but flattens out at 16-packet batch at 27Mpps.
Rust is consistently about 10% slower than C until C flattens out, then Rust catches up at the 32-packet batch size, and both are flat at 27Mpps. 
Go is every so slightly faster than C# until the 16-packet batch size where they cross (at 19Mpps), then C# is consistently about 2Mpps faster than Go. At the 256-packet batch size, C# reaches 27Mpps, and Go 25Mpps. 
Java is faster than C# and Go at very low batch sizes, but at 4 packets per batch Java slows down (10Mpps), and quickly reaches its peak of 11 to 12 Mpps.
OCaml and Haskell follow a similar curve, with Haskell consistently about 15% slower than Java, and Ocaml somewhere between the two.
Finally, Swift and Javascript are indistinguishable from each other, both about half the speed of Haskell across the board.</p><p>Latency, at 90, 99, 99.9, 99.99.. etc., percentile. 1Mpps:
All have zero-ish latency at the 90 percentile point, then Javascript latency quickly jumps to 150us, then again at 99.99%ile jumps again to 300us.
C# is the next to increase: at the 99%ile mark there's a steady increase till it hits 40us at 99.99%ile. Then a steady increase to about 60us.
Haskell keeps it at about 10us until 99.99%ile, then a steady increase to about 60us, and a sudden spike at the end to 250us.
Java latency remains low until 99.95%ile, then it quickly spikes up reaching a max of 325us.
Next OCaml spikes at around 99.99%ile, reaching a max of about 170us. 
Next comes Swift, with a maximum of about 70us.
Finally, C, Rust, and Go have the lowest latency. Rust and C are indistinguishable, and Go latency diverges to about 20% higher than the other two at the 99.999%ile mark, where it sways, eventually hitting around 25us while C and rust hit about 22us.</p></div></div></div></div>
