<h2>Boring Old Business...But It Works</h2>
<p>Remember the good old days?</p>
<p>When clicks were cheaper than dirt.</p>
<p>34 people in the entire world advertised on social media...</p>
<p>...and all you needed to succeed in online biz was a website?</p>
<p>Yeah, me neither.</p>
<p>Because I didn't build my biz in 2003.</p>
<p>I built it last year at one of the most competitive times ever. All without prior experience online, an existing list, a product/offer, or any launch money.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the thing.</strong></p>
<p>With everyone blabbing about how easy it is to start an online biz...</p>
<p>And taking pics in front of rented lambos...</p>
<p>It's easy to get caught up in the hype.</p>
<p><strong>But that's a BIG mistake.</strong></p>
<p><em>Because business isn't easy.</em></p>
<p>But it IS simple.</p>
<p>Online - offline...doesn't matter.</p>
<p>It boils down to 3 things.</p>
<p><strong>Market, Offer, and Service.</strong></p>
<p>Or you could say it like this:</p>
<p><strong>Who you serve, what you serve, and how you serve.</strong></p>
<p>And the rest is either secondary or unimportant.</p>
<p><em>But that's boring huh?</em></p>
<p>We'd rather hear about making bank working 10 minutes a day from our beach house in Spain...</p>
<p>Sorry Charlie...but you need to hear this...</p>
<p>Most of the online business noise is hype.</p>
<p>Or outright lies...</p>
<p>I know because I've been there, done that, and bought the Tee-shirt...</p>
<p>I peeked behind the curtain and...let's just say it's not all sunshine and roses back there.</p>
<p>Bro with the Lambo? Sis living dat perfect Insta-life doh?</p>
<p>Yeah, not so much...</p>
<p>Everyone's got a "secret" or "system" that promises the moon.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of great stuff out there, yes even some secrets and systems. But there are also plenty of hype-rats that would love to sell you a course for 6 large teaching you all the stuff that will keep you stuck...</p>
<p>Good news and bad news, young padawan.</p>
<p>Bad news first.</p>
<p>Most people fail at online biz. (but not why or how you think...)</p>
<p>And, there's no such thing as a shortcut.</p>
<p>To actually be successful you'll need to work smart and hard.</p>
<p>You know, actually read some books...develop your knowledge and abilities....work some late nights...and get out of your comfort zone...</p>
<p>But ah, my friend!</p>
<p>The sweet taste of success.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the good news...</strong></p>
<p>A successful online business is within your grasp.</p>
<p>If...</p>
<p>You're willing to dive into the beautiful, boring, basics like a pig into warm mud.</p>
<p>And do the work.</p>
<p>The fun part?</p>
<p>I'll give you the treasure map.</p>
<p>But you've got to dig.</p>
<p>If that's not your cup o tea I'm sure there's a goo-roo that will happily sell you a course on building an online business while you nap in your yacht...</p>
<p>Or, you could kick it old-school with me and let me show you the actual ropes.</p>
<p>Here's the deal:</p>
<p>I've got this email list, <em>see</em>, and I send a LOT of emails. But only ones that will ACTUALLY help you build your business bigger, faster, and smarter...</p>
<p>If that sounds good...you know what to do next...</p>
