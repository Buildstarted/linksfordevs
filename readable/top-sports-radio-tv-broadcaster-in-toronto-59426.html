He produced a fast paced, 30 minute hilight/feature driven show. It required quick thinking, ability to adapt, and leadership on a daily basis.

He was prepared for whatever assignment was sent his way. He wasn’t afraid to cover various sports, whether it was considered mainstream or not. A friendly face who makes people around him (co-workers, athletes, coaches or management) feel comfortable. Professional but not pushy, which I always thought brought out the best in the story he was covering or producing. A real gentleman in the world of sports.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gene Principe</strong><span>Rogers Sportsnet, NHL Host &amp; Reporter</span></p></div></div>
