Our own team has been facing some of the challenges that are part of this transition, and it has motivated us to double down on our priority to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/20/helping-developers-stay-productive-working-remotely/" target="_blank">help developers stay productive from anywhere</a>. First, we made remote collaboration easier by enabling users to <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/for-all-things-remote-development/">join Live Share sessions from their browser</a>. Today, I‚Äôm excited to share more news, this time related to Visual Studio Online, that will help you be productive from wherever you‚Äôre working.</p><p>Tl;dr ‚Äì <a href="#new-name">new name</a>, <a href="#lower-price">lower prices</a>, <a href="#added-features">added features</a>!</p><p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/vscodespaces-1024x640.png" data-featherlight="image"> <img src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/vscodespaces-1024x640.png" alt="Visual Studio Codespaces" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/vscodespaces-1024x640.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/vscodespaces-300x187.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/vscodespaces-768x480.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/vscodespaces.png 1514w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"> </a></p><h2 id="new-name">Introducing Visual Studio Codespaces<a href="#new-name"></a></h2><p>In November I had the privilege to <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/announcing-visual-studio-online-public-preview/">announce the public preview of Visual Studio Online</a> to the world. Over the last few months we‚Äôve had a blast learning from our users and finding ways to improve. One of the most consistent things we‚Äôve heard is that the ability to create cloud-hosted dev environments is having a positive impact in more ways than we had thought. In particular, our users are finding that:</p><ul><li>The time it takes to onboard to new projects (or new tasks within an existing project) is <em>much</em> shorter</li><li>The performance of their cloud dev environment in many ways feels better than their local environment</li><li>The ability to easily switch between Visual Studio Code, the browser-based editor, or the Visual Studio IDE (<a href="https://aka.ms/vsfutures-signup" target="_blank">in private preview</a>) gives them the flexibility to work from just about any device</li><li>It‚Äôs easy to collaborate with others since <a href="https://aka.ms/vsls" target="_blank">Live Share</a> is built-in for co-authoring, editing, and debugging.</li></ul><p>We learned that developers are finding Visual Studio Online to be much more than just an ‚Äúeditor in the browser‚Äù. They are saying that ‚Äú<em>the capabilities of this cloud-hosted dev environment make it the space where I want to write all my code</em>‚Äú.</p><p>To better align with that sentiment, and the true value of the service, we‚Äôre renaming Visual Studio Online to Visual Studio Codespaces. (It‚Äôs true what they say, naming is hard! üòâ) Do  you want a great experience working on your long-term project? Do it in a Codespace. Need to quickly prototype a new feature or perform some short-term tasks (like reviewing pull requests)? Create a Codespace! Your Codespaces are simply the most productive space to code. üéâ</p><p>Look for these naming changes to begin appearing in the product in the coming weeks and months.</p><h2 id="lower-price">New, lower prices<a href="#lower-price"></a></h2><p>We believe that Visual Studio <s>Online</s> Codespaces offers the best remote development experience on the market. We want to make sure as many people as possible have access to and use Codespaces, especially given the challenges we all currently face. To make that a reality, we‚Äôre lowering our prices over the course of the next week.</p><p>As we always have, we‚Äôll continue to charge only for the time and resources you use (and not one second more!). While you‚Äôre active in a Codespace it leverages Azure compute resources. The new pricing for each active Codespace breaks down like this:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Linux instance type</th><th>Price / hr (today)<sup>*</sup></th><th>Price / hr (next week)<sup>*</sup></th></tr><tr><td>Standard (4 cores, 8 GB RAM)</td><td>$0.45</td><td>$0.17</td></tr><tr><td>Premium (8 cores, 16 GB RAM)</td><td>$0.87</td><td>$0.34</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>This is a change that I‚Äôm very excited to be able to announce. Full pricing details will be available on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/visual-studio-online/" target="_blank">the pricing page</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/" target="_blank">calculator</a> by Build.</p><h2 id="added-features">Only the power you need<a href="#added-features"></a></h2><p>Finally, we‚Äôre also announcing one new feature today. (Is this my ‚Äúone more thing‚Äù moment!?) While developers love the performance that they are seeing in our cloud-hosted Codespaces, we‚Äôve also learned that there‚Äôs lots of scenarios that either don‚Äôt require so much power, or where developers want to run multiple smaller Codespaces so that they can flexibly multitask.</p><p>To better enable those scenarios, as well as to help people transitioning to remote development for the first time, we‚Äôre introducing a Basic instance type that comes with two virtual cores, four GB RAM, and 64 GB of SSD storage. We did a lot of testing with this configuration, and the experience is just as great as it is on our Standard and Premium instance types ‚Äì but at a lower cost. Basic instance types are available right now.</p><p>Here‚Äôs the above pricing table repeated with the Basic instance type added in:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Linux instance type</th><th>Price / hr (today)<sup>*</sup></th><th>Price / hr (next week)<sup>*</sup></th></tr><tr><td>Basic (2 cores, 4 GB RAM)</td><td>$0.24</td><td>$0.08</td></tr><tr><td>Standard (4 cores, 8 GB RAM)</td><td>$0.45</td><td>$0.17</td></tr><tr><td>Premium (8 cores, 16 GB RAM)</td><td>$0.87</td><td>$0.34</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>Remote development, better than ever</h2><p>I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt also take this opportunity to let you know that in the past few months we‚Äôve added some other great features to the service! My personal favorite is <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/whats-new-in-visual-studio-online-feb-2020/">our support for bring-your-own Dockerfiles or images</a>. With this feature, a Codespace can be tailored to your exact specifications, either by pointing at an image from a registry like Docker Hub, or by placing a custom Dockerfile in your repository, which Visual Studio Codespaces will run and connect you to.</p><p>We also recently shipped a small but mighty feature that lets users change the instance size of their environments. This means that you can spend the majority of your time in a lower powered, lower cost environment and then ‚Äúupgrade the horsepower‚Äù only if and when you need to ‚Äì without losing state or having to create a new environment. To top it off, the Basic instance type also supports this, so you can play Goldilocks and find the instance type that‚Äôs just right for you. üë©üèº üêªüêªüêª</p><p>The last recent addition that I‚Äôm excited about is the massive improvement we‚Äôve made to our self-hosted environment capabilities. With self-hosted environments you can register any machine to Visual Studio Codespaces and connect to it from either VS Code or our browser-based editor. Best of all, this is 100% free! My colleague Allison <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/bring-your-own-machine-to-visual-studio-online/">announced all the details</a> ‚Äì be sure to check out her post for more info.</p><h2>Try it now</h2><p>Between our lowered pricing, spiffy new name, the Basic instance type, and all the other features the team has been shipping, there‚Äôs never been a better time to try remote development with Visual Studio Codespaces. <a href="https://aka.ms/vso-login" target="_blank">Go give it a try</a> and let us know what you think in the comments.</p><p>Stay safe out there,<br> Nik Molnar &amp; the Visual Studio Codespaces team üëçüèº</p><p><small>* ‚Äì Prices are approximate.
