<p>
The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs editor</a> predates
Linux, and was once far more popular, but it 
  has fallen into relative obscurity over the years.
In a mega-thread on the emacs-devel mailing list, participants discussed
various ideas for making Emacs more "attractive", in both aesthetic
and in  "appealing to more users" senses of that term.  Any improvements
to Emacs in that regard have numerous hurdles to overcome, however.  There
are technical questions and, naturally, licensing considerations, but
there is also the philosophical question of what it is, exactly, that stops
the venerable text editor from being more popular.
</p>

<h4>So square</h4>

<p>
The discussion started with <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/8wXYP4GY9hwW-9mYv6_LGMETZ8Vz3Ob1Bec6yh6kPT7yxjTkxA3V6dXY4ELra9tYiJUxJmgXKSIEX4w8HFiPRoeGVSQHDSoBVy1voj1e3Qo=@protonmail.com/">post</a>
from "ndame" asking why Emacs is "<span>so square</span>"; the appearance
of things like buttons could be improved with rounded corners, they said.
Richard Stallman, one of the original authors of Emacs, seemed somewhat
dismissive in his <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/E1jOYIC-000709-3J@fencepost.gnu.org/">reply</a>:
"<span>Perhaps we should implement a mode that puts cosmetics on Emacs 
so it will appeal to those who judge by the surface of things.</span>"
But Stefan Kangas <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/CADwFkmnyYPjLd8=N7K955v5+34+wgDAUrC6C6KGG0xvT3OJr9g@mail.gmail.com/">thought</a>
there was more to it than that:
</p><div><p>
I think it's unfortunate if we assume that this is all bells and
whistles.  Graphical design elements can also improve usability.
</p><p>
I also don't know that it's helpful to assume that the rest of the
world will take the enlightened stance.  For example, I've always
assumed that many people use Sublime Text not due to any serious
feature comparison with Emacs, but because they like its "sleek look".
</p></div>


<p>
He wondered if there was "<span>any reason not to improve the default
look</span>".  Stallman <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/E1jOuIG-0004CF-OB@fencepost.gnu.org/">said</a> that
there are some technical barriers in finding someone interested in and capable
of doing the work needed, but there is an overarching problem that
needs to be addressed first:
</p><p>
The code to interface Emacs to X-based GUIs needs rewriting by an
expert, and has needed it for decades.  Until it gets that rewrite,
changes in it are likely to break something.
</p>


<p>
Stallman did agree that the graphical design could improve usability,
"<span>but I have a feeling that the changes 
that would help are deeper issues than the shape of corners</span>".  The
GUI interface only matters if Emacs users are leaving those features
(e.g. the menu bar and tool bar) enabled,  Eli Zaretskii <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/83y2qwdmnd.fsf@gnu.org/">said</a>, but much of the
advice out there on configuring Emacs suggests disabling those things.
</p><p>
It is hard to be enthusiastic about making
these features more modern when the community seems to be divided on
whether they should at all be present.  IMO, we should first get our
act together and decide whether these features are important, and then
speak up according to those decisions when we see advice to the
contrary.
</p>


<p>
Beyond that, though, there are bigger problems with Emacs as a whole,
Joseph Garvin <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/CAH=MJ4Yu0_ZLzm-W1-+i4JNh0PLSdNUGOxrzCkPjwtZ55EDEyg@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>.
The Emacs user interface "<span>doesn't look or behave like any other
application</span>", the keyboard shortcuts are different than other
programs, and the terminology used in the Emacs world does not match with
what users expect:
</p><div><p>
[...] no Microsoft word user has ever considered themselves to have opened
a "buffer". They open "files". They move "windows" around, not 
"frames." They cut and paste not kill and yank, etc.
</p><p>
You are basically making a commitment to being or becoming a power user. I
certainly would not have put up with it if I didn't think it was going to
save me a lot of time as a software developer (and it does, 
everyday). I doubt anyone invests the mental effort to deal with learning
emacs nowadays unless this is their goal. If you just want to do "casual"
text editing emacs is a very weird choice in 2020. 
</p></div>


<p>
But "modernizing" Emacs (however defined) is likely to be a waste of the
project's time, since its look is not what's holding it back, Ahmed
Khanzada <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/863691n4xl.wl-me@enzu.ru/">said</a>.  For
example: 
"<span>Terminal-based Vim is not like a modern application, yet is more
popular than Emacs.</span>"  The appeal of an editor that can be extended
using the Lisp language is somewhat limited, he said.  Spending a bunch of
time and energy to give it a modern look would not change that and, by the
time the work was done, the definition of "modern" will have changed again.
</p>

<h4>Popularity</h4>

<p>
Kangas <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/CADwFkm=Vashc18sr=+h8XEdLAKa38U94jsnzc+TgABWFx0uQ9g@mail.gmail.com/">wondered</a>
about the assertion of Vim's popularity;  Khanzada <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/86blno9yle.wl-me@enzu.ru/">pointed</a> to a <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools">2019
survey</a> that showed Vim with a substantial lead over Emacs (20% to 3% is
what he reported, though it shows 25% to 4% as of this writing).   That survey
showed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code">Visual Studio
Code</a> (VSC) is the clear winner, however, with 50+% of 
respondents using that tool.  You could perhaps quibble with
the survey's methodology, but the broad-brush numbers do not seem wildly
out of line.
</p>

<p>
That set off some discussion of why users prefer the experience with
VSC. "<span>We need to figure out why VSC is so popular, and then 
fill in the areas that Emacs is missing</span>", Po Lu <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/875zdv9jf3.fsf@yahoo.com/">said</a>.  Bob Newell
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/CADoYgq-tj61Pfgm=zVJ50ZLjG+nTcLt_p0W0pZa4sFzsb59Tfg@mail.gmail.com/">thought</a>
that "<span>the goal
of making Emacs more accessible and more appealing is laudable and
ambitious</span>"; it is something that the project could accomplish, he
said.  He is worried, though, that today's software is aimed at "instant
gratification" rather than long-term usability—and power.
</p><p>
Yes, make Emacs appealing and user friendly. But don't forget that a
masterful tool in the end requires mastery, which can't come for free.
I certainly draw the line at saying Emacs is for everyone. I'm not
saying it's only for some sort of snooty "elite" but I am saying that
it's for those who are willing to learn, seeing some extra work as the
aforementioned long-term investment, and who have the patience reach a
worthy goal a little later rather than right this very minute.
</p>


<p>
Stallman <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/E1jQi0V-000320-Sf@fencepost.gnu.org/">agreed</a> with
that sentiment.  But he would also <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/E1jQM1d-0007n9-BV@fencepost.gnu.org/">like to see</a>
Emacs return to popularity <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/E1jQi44-0003eV-0u@fencepost.gnu.org/">as an editor of
text for publication</a>.  Several noted that <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a> is already being used successfully for
text-publication purposes.  That mode is <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/E1jR5ss-0001xM-L9@fencepost.gnu.org/">not
familiar</a> to Stallman and he was unable to learn much about using it
for word processing by reading the documentation.   Zaretskii <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/83v9lregx0.fsf@gnu.org/">pointed out</a> that there
is a high barrier to learning Org mode from its documentation, at least for
the word-processing use case.
</p>

<p>
Once again, though, it seems quite unlikely
that some putative, well-documented word-processing Emacs mode is likely to have users
flocking to the editor.  But Stallman <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/E1jPzXg-0003tH-MT@fencepost.gnu.org/">said</a> that
the user profile for Emacs was much broader 30 years ago; he would like to
see it be that way again.  He personally does not see rounded corners as part
of that, though he is not opposed to efforts in that direction; "<span>[...] if you want
to attract more users to Emacs, I think there are more important
areas for improvement.</span>"  Lu <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/87imhw431x.fsf@yahoo.com/">had some ideas</a> along
those lines, for example using <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/StarterKits">starter kits</a> (or
packs) to help make the editor "<span>more friendly to newcomers</span>".
</p>

<p>
There was a difference of opinion about making changes to the defaults,
though, in order to help newcomers. If changes need to be made for the sake
of newcomers, ndame <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/nBz61t2TEA4FJbun5KtDMQlnaI3Y8jE1loAcCJPTgilcVDC5ns7QyUh6WUfGEFn0Bnw5od3SX-iZRZ08Sfj26GUO64h91QPuc2HeOzWyPVU=@protonmail.com/">said</a>,
established users can just turn them off.  For example, <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CuaMode">Cua Mode</a>, which adds the
"standard" keybindings for things like cut and paste (i.e. ctrl-c, ctrl-x,
ctrl-v) to Emacs, should be on by default; "<span>it could
make the life of new users easier if they didn't have to turn it on explicitly
and they could use their copy/paste keys from the start like they are used it to
in other tools</span>".
</p>

<p>
But Lu <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/87k12bdgx7.fsf@yahoo.com/">suggested</a>
adding a button for newcomers to turn on those features from the splash
screen instead.  Better still might be for Emacs to recognize a possible
newcomer, ndame <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/RtuoskwUPgcjfttdVWYUzFKTAPGRcbaMR_zTV1bZGTDbo_07pkyfq6avexjdhEWZDNZmI3WCFZjgIhiIOEwODgZZTqN_QjYFa7S70kRZ4zU=@protonmail.com/">suggested</a>:
</p><div><p>
A button can work too. Or if emacs is started with no config file then it can
ask "Are you using Emacs for the first time?" If the user says yes then it
can offer to set some convenience features like CUA mode.
</p><p>
And if the user says no then everything is as usual.
</p></div>


<p>
There was some discussion of gathering feedback before deciding to change
defaults and such, but Dmitry Gutov <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/45098d13-2770-4a19-6f82-b22276eb51c8@yandex.ru/">wondered</a>
if existing users are even relevant.  If expanding the reach of Emacs is
the goal, it may make sense to look at the problem differently:
</p><div><p>
So for all questions about changing defaults, we should ask ourselves, do
we prioritize the existing 5% (or 3%, as SO poll says) userbase that will
naturally continue shrinking over the years, or whether we prefer to make
life easier and more productive for the users that should come later.
</p><p>
And it's not like existing, long-time users can't grow to like the new
defaults (even after a certain amount of grumbling).
</p></div>


<p>
Lu <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/877dy91mb0.fsf@yahoo.com/">disagreed</a>;
"<span>We should prioritize existing users over hypothetical users that
don't 
even exist yet.</span>"  But Gutov <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/0ce06d95-0593-bc55-983f-6b6601503a1a@yandex.ru/">said</a>
that might be shortsighted; "<span>I don't want Emacs to die out, and it will if we don't do the work of
attracting new users.</span>"  No real conclusion was reached; everyone
would like to see the number of Emacs users (developers, testers,
documentation writers, ...) grow, but how to do so is unclear at best.
</p>

<h4>Licensing</h4>

<p>
Back to rounded corners, Zaretskii <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/83lfmxgt6c.fsf@gnu.org/">said</a> that the only thing
standing in the way of that was code to implement it; "<span>[...] patches to add
such capabilities to Emacs are most welcome</span>".   But Emacs is
multi-platform, Gutov <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/ce35ba27-622e-4f78-fc00-7f17ef6d7dcb@yandex.ru/">said</a>,
which means that buttons look different on each.  Even on the same
platform, different graphics toolkits give different looks—and the looks
change between toolkit releases.
</p>

<p>
Alex Bennée <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/87r1wng2ki.fsf@linaro.org/">suggested</a> that
"<span>unifying under  a single cross-platform toolkit like GTK+</span>"
would avoid some parts of the problem, but he also noted that a longstanding
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85715">bug</a> in GTK+
had caused him to use Emacs with the Lucid toolkit instead.  He also
worried about the next generation: "<span>I've been thinking about text editors for my
children to use as they graduate from point and click programming to
proper text and even I'm not sure I want their first experience to be
Emacs.</span>" 
</p>

<p>
Zaretskii <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/83o8rrenn1.fsf@gnu.org/">pointed out</a>
that GTK+ is not really cross-platform. In addition, the bug in question is
not considered to be one by the GNOME developers, which led  Ulrich Mueller
to <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/u8sivv1lb_-_@gentoo.org/">muse</a> about a
switch to Qt.  But Stallman was quick to <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/E1jPGhC-0003i1-W4@fencepost.gnu.org/">put the kibosh</a> on that; Qt is only
available for GPL&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3, using it would mean that if there is a
GPL&nbsp;4 someday, Emacs could not switch to it. "<span>So we must avoid
using Qt.</span>" 
</p>

<p>
Electron was also <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/CAO2hHWZGk0iq0ROoLoeLGwDYRmu-sQeMJuVQ-rziFd+O5Z=8ng@mail.gmail.com/">raised</a>
as a possibility, but it turns out to have "<span>freedom issues</span>",
Lu <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/878siptegk.fsf@yahoo.com/">said</a>.  It is not
clear how serious any of these ideas were; switching graphics toolkits is
a decidedly non-trivial undertaking.  It does seem like an indication that
some in the Emacs development community are getting frustrated with the
GUI version(s) of the editor.  Beyond that, many of the Emacs developers do
not even use the GTK+ version because of the bug, which leads to less
interest in improving that version of Emacs; it all seems to be something of a mess.
</p>

<p>
The icons used by Emacs were also questioned in the thread, with licensing
rearing its head there as well.  The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/">Emacs subreddit</a> is apparently
fertile ground for thoughts and suggestions as it came up a few times in
the thread.  For example, ndame <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/qcx9gTVkYn55kqfq16drSfrURpHlTlC3JVCnh8v0MWHsJCFHzg-CPbHgaAw4SP6otQ_Q1VED_2Wrx5XrzNvWtAlZeryp7ssZc8ANKNL7Xv8=@protonmail.com/">reported</a>
"<span>that a user posted a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6sIHOGt.png">screenshot</a> of an emacs 
toolbar with really sad looking icons at the end</span>".   There are icon
sets available under the GPL that could be used instead, they asserted.
But Zaretskii <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/83y2qvcjv6.fsf@gnu.org/">cautioned</a> that things
may not be that clear-cut:
</p><p>
Feel free to point us to GPLed icons that can be incorporated in
Emacs.  At the time, the situation was nowhere as easy as you imply,
but maybe things have changed since then.
</p>


<p>
Several icon sets were suggested, including GNOME icons, some from
Wikimedia, and those from KDE, all of which are available under various
free licenses (GPL, Creative Commons, LGPL).  But there is more work to do
than just identifying candidates, Zaretskii <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/83k12ed20s.fsf@gnu.org/">said</a>:
</p><div><p>
Someone™ needs to invest the time and effort to figure out the legal
issues, find the icons that we want out of those which are legally
fit, and post the resulting information.  We did that process at the
time (AFAIR, quite a few of our icons come from Gnome/GTK), and it
wasn't easy.
</p><p>
Alternatively, someone could create our own icons, in which case they
could be even prettier than the ones pointed out here.
</p><p>
In any case, this is a non-trivial job, and volunteers are most
welcome to do it.  I don't think anyone is happy about the icons shown
on the tool bar by Message mode; the only reason we use them is that
we couldn't find better ones that are free and suitable for inclusion
in Emacs.
</p></div>


<p>
But, ndame <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/9GxTqx0raB6NkyAQ4gjUHfoCFK4rgmvRKZaUUxM-p6WOuO_3oJOBYiXI4L8pGz-VtHtgYKJ14Z1nU9UmZ68nJLO18nLYnaBaqBxLEaNN9mg=@protonmail.com/">asked</a>,
shouldn't 
icons that come from GNOME, a longstanding free-software project, be
perfectly acceptable to use in Emacs?  Sadly, it is not so easy as that,
Zaretskii <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/83d086cu05.fsf@gnu.org/">said</a>:
"<span>IANAL, but I think it has to be GPL v2+ at least.  And perhaps we 
would also need the copyright assigned to the FSF.</span>"  For example,
the Wikimedia icons are available under the the LGPLv3 and Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)&nbsp;3.0 licenses, but neither of those would work for
pieces that are part of the Emacs program, Stallman <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/E1jPzZX-0004DO-HS@fencepost.gnu.org/">said</a>.
Without the "or later" on the LGPL grant, the Qt problem would exist; CC
BY-SA&nbsp;3.0 "<span>is incompatible with every version of the
GPL</span>".  But that may not matter in the end:
</p><div><p>
If the icons would NOT be part of the program, Emacs, then there
is no conflict.
</p><p>
The Emacs distribution contains many works, including textual, art,
and small programs, which are distinct from the program, Emacs.
</p></div>


<p>
Zaretskii and Stallman were able to determine that icons for Emacs fall
into that category, so they simply need to be available under any free
license, which should simplify things—if someone gets the time and energy
to work on the problem.  Like most projects, Emacs suffers from a shortage
of human power; a project to improve the GUI that may not be widely used by
those developers could go wanting.  And that, in a lot of ways, sums up the
situation with the editor project.
</p>

<h4>Moving forward</h4>

<p>
Emacs is quite useful for its adherents; many of them see it is their main
interface to their computers. Others use it regularly but less
universally.  There are even longtime Vim users (who may have started on
vi, in truth) that need Emacs for certain tasks—me for example.  It serves
all of these users well, but does it really still have a role in ten, twenty, or
forty years?  It is not an easy question to answer, of course; certainly it
will still be with us in both ten and twenty years, but how many users will
it have in forty?
</p>

<p>
Part of the problem is that the dedicated following for Emacs is also
pretty resistant to change to any major degree.  That's not meant as a
knock of any sort, simply an observation.  There are plenty of examples in
that huge thread of ideas that were seemingly shot down because they
represent change that might upset existing users.
But it would seem that some changes of some sort are needed to bring in new blood.
If few or no new users
are coming in and nothing is done to attract more, it can only lead to
eventual extinction.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully that is not the path that Emacs is on—or if it is, that it
changes direction before (too) long.  It is one of the earliest
free-software programs in existence; pre-dating the term "free software" by
nearly a decade, in fact.  Of course, the code itself need never disappear
entirely, but a vibrant—growing—Emacs community would be wonderful to see.
</p>

<p>
In truth, we have barely scratched the surface of that mega-thread.  There
are plenty of sub-threads that went completely unmentioned here; those
interested in Emacs development—warts and all—will find plenty to read and
digest there.  Whether Emacs ends up with rounded corners or not seems like simply
the tip of the iceberg of things that might need to be addressed to make
Emacs more newcomer-friendly.  How that can happen within that community
remains to be seen.
