<p>Tye is a developer tool that makes developing, testing, and deploying microservices and distributed applications easier. Project Tye includes a local orchestrator to make developing microservices easier and the ability to deploy microservices to Kubernetes with minimal configuration.</p>
<p>Tye can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify microservices development by making it easy to:
<ul>
<li>Run many services with one command</li>
<li>Use dependencies in containers</li>
<li>Discover addresses of other services using simple conventions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deploy .NET applications to Kubernetes by:
<ul>
<li>Automatically containerizing .NET applications</li>
<li>Generating Kubernetes manifests with minimal knowledge or configuration</li>
<li>Using the same conventions as development to keep it consistent</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>Project Tye is an open source experiment that will last at least until Nov 2020. We are using this time to try radical ideas to improve microservices developer productivity and see what works.</p>
<p>We plan to do releases with new features roughly every 4 weeks.</p>
<p>For the duration of the experiment, consider every part of the tye experience to be volatile. We will frequently make additions and changes to features that seem polished. We welcome feedback from anyone who's willing to be an early-adopter with tye; the team wants to know what's working well, and what's missing to build a whole-package .NET microservices developer productivity suite.</p>
