I'm writing a third edition of Security Engineering, and hope to have it 
finished by Easter 2020 so it can be in bookstores for Academic Year 
2020-1. 

<p>
With both the first edition in 2001 and the second edition in 2008, I
put six chapters online for free at once, then added the others four
years after publication.
For the third edition, I've negotiated an agreement with the publisher
to put the chapters online for review as I write them. So the book
will come out by instalments, like Dickens' novels. Once the
manuscript's finished and goes to press, all except seven sample
chapters will disappear for a commercial period of 42 months. I'm
afraid the publishers insist on that. But therearefter the whole book
will be free online forever.

</p><p>
Here are the chapters I've put online for review so far:

</p><p>

If you see anything wrong or missing, or you think some aspect of any
chapter topic isn't covered adequately, please email me at Ross dot
Anderson at cl dot cam dot ac dot uk.

</p><p>

This approach was inspired by the collaborative authorship model
pioneered by my late friend and colleague David MacKay for his great
books on <a href="https://withouthotair.com/">sustainable energy</a>
and <a href="http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/book.html">coding
theory</a>.

I made a video for the launch, which you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q--8SidkBII&amp;feature=youtu.be">here</a>.

‘There is an extraordinary textbook written by Ross Anderson, professor of computer security at University of Cambridge. It’s called Security Engineering, and despite being more than 1,000 pages long, it’s one of the most readable pop-science slogs of the decade.’
<br><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/05/when-data-gets-creepy-secrets-were-giving-away">Ben Goldacre</a></p><p>
‘I'm incredibly impressed that one person could produce such a thorough
coverage. Moreover, you make the stuff easy and enjoyable to read. I
find it just as entertaining — and far more useful —
than novels (and my normal science fiction). When I first got it in
the mail, I said to myself "I'm never going to read all of that." But
once I started reading I just kept going and going. Fantastic: well
done. Now, let's hope that all those in charge of security for
information technology will also read the book and heed the lessons.’
<br><a href="http://www.jnd.org/">Don Norman</a></p><p>
‘The book that you MUST READ 
RIGHT NOW is the second edition of Ross Anderson's Security Engineering book. 
Ross did a complete pass on his classic tome and somehow made it even 
better...’

My goal in making the first edition <a href="http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2006/08/25/with-a-single-bound-it-was-free/">freely
available</a> five years after publication was twofold. First, I wanted to
reach the widest possible audience, especially among poor students. Second, I
am a pragmatic libertarian on free culture and free software issues; I think
that many publishers (especially of music and software) are too defensive of
copyright. (My colleague David MacKay found that putting his <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/">book on coding
theory</a> online actually helped its sales. Book publishers are getting the
message faster than the music or software folks.) I expect to put the whole
second edition online too in a few years.

</p><p> If you own the first edition of my book, I hope you liked it enough to
upgrade to the second edition. I also have online errata for the first edition
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/errata.html">here</a>.
