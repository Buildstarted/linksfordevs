<h2><span id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<h3><span id="What_did_Proposition_4_change_about_enacting_an_income_tax_in_Texas.3F">What did Proposition 4 change about enacting an income tax in Texas?</span></h3>
<p>Before Proposition 4, the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Texas_Constitution" title="Texas Constitution">Texas State Constitution</a> required the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Texas_State_Legislature" title="Texas State Legislature">state legislature</a> to put legislation enacting an income tax before voters as a statewide referendum, which voters could approve or reject. Placing a referendum before voters required a simple majority vote (50%+1) in each legislative chamber.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>Proposition 4 replaced the referendum requirement with a ban on enacting an income tax on individuals. Since Proposition 4's ban on an income tax added a provision of the Texas Constitution, a two-thirds vote in each legislative chamber and a statewide referendum are needed to repeal or amend the ban.
</p><p>Therefore, one of the practical effects of Proposition 4 was to increase the legislative vote requirement to authorize an income tax.<sup id="cite_ref-text_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-text-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Proposition 4 repealed the existing requirement that an income tax, should one be enacted, be used to reduce school ad valorem (property) taxes and increase education funding.<sup id="cite_ref-text_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-text-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>The ballot measure also replaced the phrase "tax on the net incomes of <i>natural persons</i>" with the phrase "tax on the net incomes of <i>individuals</i>."<sup id="cite_ref-text_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-text-2">[2]</a></sup> There was disagreement between some supporters and opponents of the measure regarding the relevance and meaning of the change from <i>natural persons</i> to <i>individuals</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> On May 15, 2019, the Legislative Budget Board wrote that because Proposition 4 did not define <i>individuals</i>, the language could be interpreted to include businesses that are subject to the state's franchise tax.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> On May 27, 2019, the legislature passed a bill, which the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Texas_Governor" title="Texas Governor">governor</a> signed, that defined <i>individuals</i> as a natural person and excluded partnerships, corporations, banks, and other legal entities.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span id="Did_Texas_have_an_income_tax.3F">Did Texas have an income tax?</span></h3>
<p>As of 2019, Texas was one of seven states without a personal income tax. Texas had never levied a tax on personal income. The other 43 states collected an income tax in addition to the federal income tax. As of 2019, the most recent state to enact a personal income tax was New Jersey in 1976. The federal government enacted a federal tax on personal income in 1913.<sup id="cite_ref-taxfoundationlist_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-taxfoundationlist-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span id="How_was_Proposition_4_placed_on_the_ballot.3F">How was Proposition 4 placed on the ballot?</span></h3>
<p>The Texas State Legislature <a href="#Path_to_the_ballot">placed</a> Proposition 4 on the ballot in one of the narrowest votes between 1995 and 2019. In Texas, a two-thirds vote is required to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot, which is equal to 100 votes in the state House and 21 votes in the state Senate, assuming no vacancies. The constitutional amendment received 100 in the state House and 22 votes in the state Senate, tying with <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Texas_Rail_Relocation_and_Improvement,_Proposition_1_(2005)" title="Texas Rail Relocation and Improvement, Proposition 1 (2005)">Proposition 1</a> (2005), <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Texas_Definition_of_Marriage,_Proposition_2_(2005)" title="Texas Definition of Marriage, Proposition 2 (2005)">Proposition 2</a> (2005), and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Texas_Limit_on_Damages_in_Medical_Lawsuits,_Proposition_12_(September_2003)" title="Texas Limit on Damages in Medical Lawsuits, Proposition 12 (September 2003)">Proposition 12</a> (2003) for having the narrowest margin of approval in the legislature between 1995 and 2019. Most legislative Democrats (65 percent) opposed Proposition 4. Legislative Republicans, along with 29 percent of legislative Democrats, supported the constitutional amendment.

Section 1. (c) The Legislature may provide for the taxation of intangible property and may also impose occupation taxes, both upon natural persons and upon corporations, other than municipal, doing any business in this State. <u>The Legislature</u> <del>Subject to the restrictions of Section 24 of this article, it</del> may also tax incomes of <del>both natural persons and</del> corporations other than municipal. Persons engaged in mechanical and agricultural pursuits shall never be required to pay an occupation tax.
</p><p>Section 24-a. <u>The legislature may not impose a tax on the net incomes of individuals, including an individual’s share of partnership and unincorporated association income.</u>
</p><p><del>Section 24. (a) A general law enacted by the legislature that imposes a tax on the net incomes of natural persons, including a person's share of partnership and unincorporated association income, must provide that the portion of the law imposing the tax not take effect until approved by a majority of the registered voters voting in a statewide referendum held on the question of imposing the tax. The referendum must specify the rate of the tax that will apply to taxable income as defined by law.</del>
</p><p><del>(b) A general law enacted by the legislature that increases the rate of the tax, or changes the tax, in a manner that results in an increase in the combined income tax liability of all persons subject to the tax may not take effect until approved by a majority of the registered voters voting in a statewide referendum held on the question of increasing the income tax. A determination of whether a bill proposing a change in the tax would increase the combined income tax liability of all persons subject to the tax must be made by comparing the provisions of the proposed change in law with the provisions of the law for the most recent year in which actual tax collections have been made. A referendum held under this subsection must specify the manner in which the proposed law would increase the combined income tax liability of all persons subject to the tax.</del>
</p><p><del>(c) Except as provided by Subsection (b) of this section, the legislature may amend or repeal a tax approved by the voters under this section without submitting the amendment or the repeal to the voters as provided by Subsection (a) of this section.</del>
</p><p><del>(d) If the legislature repeals a tax approved by the voters under this section, the legislature may reenact the tax without submitting the reenactment to the voters as provided by Subsection (a) of this section only if the effective date of the reenactment of the tax is before the first anniversary of the effective date of the repeal.</del>
</p><p><del>(e) The legislature may provide for the taxation of income in a manner which is consistent with federal law.</del>
</p><p><del>(f) In the first year in which a tax described by Subsection (a) is imposed and during the first year of any increase in the tax that is subject to Subsection (b) of this section, not less than two-thirds of all net revenues remaining after payment of all refunds allowed by law and expenses of collection from the tax shall be used to reduce the rate of ad valorem maintenance and operation taxes levied for the support of primary and secondary public education. In subsequent years, not less than two-thirds of all net revenues from the tax shall be used to continue such ad valorem tax relief.</del>
</p><p><del>(g) The net revenues remaining after the dedication of money from the tax under Subsection (f) of this section shall be used for support of education, subject to legislative appropriation, allocation, and direction.</del>
</p><p><del>(h) The maximum rate at which a school district may impose ad valorem maintenance and operation taxes is reduced by an amount equal to one cent per $100 valuation for each one cent per $100 valuation that the school district's ad valorem maintenance and operation tax is reduced by the minimum amount of money dedicated under Subsection (f) of this section, provided that a school district may subsequently increase the maximum ad valorem maintenance and operation tax rate if the increased maximum rate is approved by a majority of the voters of the school district voting at an election called and held for that purpose. The legislature by general law shall provide for the tax relief that is required by Subsection (f) and this subsection.</del>

<h3><span id="Support_3">Support</span></h3>
<ul><li><i><b>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</b></i>: “This amendment would boost the needed vote in each house of the Legislature to two-thirds. The bar to a major new tax should be high.”<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup></li></ul>
<h3><span id="Opposition_2">Opposition</span></h3>
<ul><li><i><b>Austin American-Statesman</b></i>: “NO to a measure that would make it even harder to impose a state income tax, something that is already very unlikely. This measure’s flawed wording could allow courts to kill the business franchise tax, which raises billions of dollars for public education and other programs.”<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup></li>
<li><i><b>The Austin Chronicle</b></i>: “This would prohibit the state from imposing an individual income tax, which it of course has never done, and which has been a third-rail issue for generations, and which would already require statewide voter approval thanks to previous GOP tub-thumping on this issue, despite it being a more efficient and equitable way to fund public services. This is pure base-scratching bullshit to "send a message," by its supporters' own admission.”<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup></li>
<li><i><b>Corpus Christi Caller-Times</b></i>: “At best, this is an unnecessary feel-good measure whose main purpose is for its sponsors to be able to take political credit for it. At worst, it's a yoke on future generations of Texans whose challenges maybe different and better-served by an income tax. We Texans pay a huge price in property tax to be able to say we don't have an income tax.”<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup></li>
<li><i><b>The Dallas Morning News</b></i>: “This newspaper opposes a state income tax. Its absence is one of the big reasons people move here and companies do business here. The state constitution already requires the approval of a majority of lawmakers and then a majority of voters to change that. But Proposition 4 would unnecessarily require a supermajority (two-thirds). There’s no need to clutter the constitution with unnecessary amendments like this.”<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup></li>
<li><i><b>The Eagle</b></i>: “The same stiff requirements to enact an income tax that have been in place since 1993 will remain in force. But, if Texas and Texans ever decide in the future to overhaul our antiquated tax system and put in an income tax, we shouldn’t make it harder to do so.”<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup></li>
<li><i><b>Houston Chronicle</b></i>: “In the end, though, it’s unclear why a change is needed. What’s more, some argue Prop 4’s wording of “individual income tax” is vague enough to draw a court challenge that could extend the ban to businesses, which could cost the state billions in revenue. Why take that risk? We say vote “Against” and leave dead enough alone.”<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup></li>
<li><i><b>Longview News-Journal</b></i>: “We oppose a state income tax but Texas already has an amendment prohibiting the Legislature from imposing one without a statewide referendum. This proposition has the feel of showboating with no practical purpose. Beyond that, we have no way of knowing how future Texans might want to fund government.”<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup></li>
<li><i><b>San Antonio Express-News</b></i>: "It’s unnecessary and ties the hands of future Texans."<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup></li>
<li><i><b>Waco Tribune-Herald</b></i>: “This is political pandering of the worst sort, given it’s already nearly impossible to create a state income tax without voter approval. Plus, given legislative discussions about eliminating the much-hated property tax on daily school operations, approving this amendment could have the unintended consequence of eliminating viable options. Think twice, fellow taxpayer!”<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup></li></ul>

<h3><span id="States_and_personal_income_taxes">States and personal income taxes</span></h3>
<p>As of 2019, Texas was one of seven states without a personal income tax. Texas had never levied a tax on personal income. Along with Texas, Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming did not have personal income taxes. The other 43 states collected an income tax in addition to the federal income tax.<sup id="cite_ref-taxfoundationlist_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-taxfoundationlist-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>The first state to enact a personal income tax was Wisconsin in 1911. Hawaii enacted an income tax in 1901, which was before Wisconsin, but Hawaii was not a state until 1959. The most recent state, as of 2019, to enact a personal income tax was New Jersey in 1976. The federal government enacted a federal tax on personal income in 1913.<sup id="cite_ref-taxfoundationlist_6-2"><a href="#cite_note-taxfoundationlist-6">[6]</a></sup>

SB 14 required that every voter must present one of the following at his or her polling place: a Texas driver's license, a Texas Election Identification Certificate, a Texas personal identification card, a Texas concealed handgun license, a United States Military Identification Card containing the person’s photograph, a United States citizenship certificate containing the person’s photograph, or a United States passport. Preclearance was denied on March 13, 2012, and a lawsuit was subsequently filed by the state. On August 30, 2012, a three-judge panel in the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia" title="United States District Court for the District of Columbia">United States District Court for the District of Columbia</a> unanimously struck down the voter ID law. The court ruled that the law would negatively impact minority voter turnout and impose strict burdens upon the poor.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>
</p><p>The state filed a lawsuit against the ruling, beginning several years of hearings and rulings across the federal judiciary. On April 27, 2018, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit issued a 2-1 ruling reversing the earlier district court order that had barred the state from enforcing the provisions of its voter ID law.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> On June 19, 2018, the Fifth Circuit dismissed a further appeal, allowing Texas' voter ID law to stand.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>
</p><p>To read a full summary of the cases related to SB 14, <b><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Voter_ID_in_Texas" title="Voter ID in Texas">click here</a></b>.
</p><p>As of December 2019, 34 states enforced (or were scheduled to begin enforcing) <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Voter_identification" title="Voter identification">voter identification</a> requirements. A total of 19 states required voters to present photo identification at the polls; the remainder accepted other forms of identification. Valid forms of identification differ by state. Commonly accepted forms of ID include driver's licenses, state-issued identification cards, and military identification cards.<sup id="cite_ref-ncslvoterID_41-0"><a href="#cite_note-ncslvoterID-41">[41]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wapostID_42-0"><a href="#cite_note-wapostID-42">[42]</a></sup>
