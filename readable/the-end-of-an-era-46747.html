                    <h3>2D Artwork: 101</h3>
                    <p>Perhaps you want to make games, create animations, or VFX for film. Perhaps you want to create concept art, or simply create for your own pleasure. Whether you're working with 2D or 3D art, it's important to have a grounding in the rules and basic techniques.
            
            With that in mind, we asked Derek Stevens to create a series that anyone can follow. Our goal is to help you see the world, both inner and outer, by the rules of art. Over the course of the next two hours, Derek will demonstrate bringing your visions to life. From simple shapes to still life and perspective, all you have to do is follow the rules. And of course, remember how to get to Carnegie Hall. Practice, practice, practice!</p>

                    <h3>2D Game Art for Non-Artists (free)</h3>
                    <p>In this series, Steve Curtis is going to demonstrate how to harness the power of Photoshop to get beautiful 2D art work for games, even if youâ€™ve never created art before. This is High-Rez art designed to look like modern graphics but with that old school feel. Although it isnâ€™t pixel art, the graphics created could certainly be sized down to create art that has that pixel art feel. This course uses Photoshop, however GIMP and similar programs should suffice. No tablet is required, all of the art in this series was created using only a mouse. 
            
            We will create beautiful cartoon art with a modern edge, and harness light and shading techniques to give our work depth.</p>

                    <p>The Legacy Series is an archive of older videos created as free content from throughout the history of 3D Buzz. Most of these videos are a bit dated in terms of the version of the software used, but the content within them may still be very useful to some. These videos have been provided here as a way for you access some of 3D Buzz's earlier content, though it is also helpful to those who have opted out of updating to the most recent version of a particular software package.</p>

                    <p>Throughout this live class, students will be introduced to 3ds Max from the standpoint of the beginner by following techniques Mark Gerhard used to create the cut-scene of a train wreck for an Iphone game called â€œThe Adventures of Marshal Marshmallowâ€ .  He will use the steam engine as an example for modeling, and teach the techniques used for the explosions and various effects in the scene.  The  focus of the class is an understanding how to use and navigate this power program and get you started on your way to your own 3D creations!</p>

                    <p>The â€œHow Do I?â€ series is a collection of short tip-based videos covering very specific topics in a given application. The topics themselves were sent in or collected from users across the internet, and we in turn create a video which answers the question as concisely as possible. These videos are a great way to pick up little tips and tricks, or just as a way to get to know aspects of an application with which you may not yet be familiar.</p>

                    <p>Modeling on the Fly is a live video approach to modeling training. Rather than watching scripted and planned lessons over individual modeling aspects, the viewer instead gets to see how a modeler might handle a particular problem outside the world of a training lesson. Narration and critical thoughts are discussed, but essentially, the idea is that you get to look over an actual modeler's shoulder while they are working away.</p>

                    <p>Looking for a way to bring more "life" into your gaming projects? Then you're going to need a way to make your games "smarter." Artificial intelligence is one of the core elements of any modern day game production. Convincing your players that their adversary is actually thinking and considering the situation goes a long way toward making your gaming environments more believable. In this new XNA series from 3D Buzz, we take you through your first steps at developing your own game AI systems through the implementation of a simple weighted behavior system.</p>

                    <p>Welcome to "A* Pathfinding" the second set in our AI Programming series. This entry in the series continues from the topics discussed in "Behavior Systems" by exploring the world of pathfinding focusing primarily on the A* pathfinding algorithm. Pathfinding is the process of plotting out the shortest or most efficient path between two given points. A* (pronounced ay-star) is a particular pathfinding search algorithm used in many software applications for calculating this path. In determining the path, the A* algorithm takes a "distance-to-goal + path-cost" score into consideration.</p>

                    <p>C# 103 will be an 8 week course covering intermediate level C# knowledge - such as delegates, lambdas, generics and reflection. We will dig deep into the metaprogramming model exposed to us by C#â€™s versatile type system and concise syntax. Further; we will expand beyond the object oriented paradigm covered in 102 and explore the functional renaissance brought to the forefront of mainstream programming by C# 3â€™s focus on declarative programming.</p>

                    <p>The â€œHow Do I?â€ series is a collection of short tip-based videos covering very specific topics in a given application. The topics themselves were sent in or collected from users across the internet, and we in turn create a video which answers the question as concisely as possible. These videos are a great way to pick up little tips and tricks, or just as a way to get to know aspects of an application with which you may not yet be familiar.

The idea is to develop a library of concise reference style videos over specific topics within the C# language. As we progress, the reference itself will undergo some polish and tuning, eventually being broken into 3 separate sections: </p>

We will start by learning to create some of our own textures  to build our texture library, and creating a single texture sheet for our assets. From there we will learn how to extract geometry from our texture in our first method, and how to UV our geometry on our texture in the second.</p>

                    <p>The end goal of any live-action project involving CG is to make your artificial elements appear to completely belong within the live action scene. The audience must believe that your 3D creations existed in the scene during filming and were recorded with the same camera at the same time, with the same lighting. Handling this within a CG environment requires that the shaders covering the virtual surfaces be prepared to receive and work with a variety of lighting and reflection data captured from the set of your shot.</p>

We will cover the foundations of modern HTML5 and CSS3, assuming no prior experience with either technology. At the end of this course, students will be able to create modern, mobile-friendly web application layouts.</p>

Some level of programming experience will help; but a student without any will be able to follow along. The focus on this class will mainly be on JavaScript itself and how to interact with the DOM (Document Object Model) to create rich web applications.</p>

                    <h3>Modern JavaScript 2 - Real World App Development</h3>
                    <p>This course is all about creating a fully functioning production ready, real time web application! We will learn how to bring together many different libraries and techniques from the JavaScript ecosystem together into a cohesive product that is ready for deployment!
            
            Many courses focus on individual components and small example applications; while this one instead focuses on how everything can work together. If you want to see the development of a completed project working seamlessly with socket.io, nodejs, Reactive Extensions, WebPack (and more!), then this is the course for you!
            We not only have a focus on our build pipeline - both development and production - but also on creating an architecture that takes advantage of the reactive programming paradigm.
            
            It's impossible to classify this course as a tour of any particular component, since, as you know, real applications are much more complicated than that. But rest assured that we leave no stone unturned as we explore how each component can work seamlessly together.
            
            So if you want to take your JavaScript skills to the next level, if you want to be up to date on the latest development techniques, then this course is a must!</p>

The first part (which is available for free) goes over the core concepts of the new UI system; while the second part shows the creation of an entire game using the new UI for all of its visual aspects!
            
            This series is the best way to get up and running on the proper use of the New UI! Make no mistake, you need to think very differently about how to construct your user interface with this new system. This series explains the paradigm change in great detail - and by the time it is over, you will have the knowledge to create your own game UIs!</p>

The programming done is handled in an on-the-fly fashion in which viewers get to see the entire process of the coding itself, along with any design considerations or pitfalls that may occur along the way! 
            
            Itâ€™s been an interesting series to produce. Thereâ€™s a lot of in-depth content which doesn't work well for complete beginners. More than once I've been completely lost as to whatâ€™s going on at certain points along a video. At the same time, weâ€™re still wanting to make sure that people can follow along if all they've seen is some of our original C# content, and so we (being Jason and I) will do our best to ask the appropriate questions of Nelson to make sure that heâ€™s keeping the end goal in mind. </p>

We'll explore filters, layer styles, layer types, and more to maximize the heavy lifting Photoshop does for us when creating textures. By the end of the course, you'll have a strong start to a library of base textures you can use to create designs for games, web development, and more. You'll practice a little hand painting of textures, and complete 3 projects. Two 2D game pieces and a desktop background.</p>

                    <p>Welcome to Practical Game Development in Unity 4: Level 2.1!
            
            This video series is all about the practical approach to using the tools made available to us in Unity 4 to create our very own video game! Over the course of over 7 hours of training content, we will create a 3D Asteroids-style game - complete with Freelancer-style spaceship movement and weapon controls. We will show everything from a modular player controller all the way to implementing custom sounds - both 2D and 3D - and polishing the game up with a simple menu system complete with high scores! In addition, we will build a targeting HUD, a waypoint navigation system, and even some spiffy particle effects!
            
            Level 2.1 is the first in a series of training products centered around the creation of an open world 3D space game. The game we put together in this series will serve as the foundation of our future projects in this series!</p>

                    <p>This course is a complete view into building production ready applications using React and Reactive Extensions!
            
            This series is a project-based look at using all of the technologies that are becoming commonplace in the web development world. We use Gulp, WebPack, Babel, SASS, and Jasmine to put together a real-world asset pipeline that will support the development and deployment of our application.
            
            The goal of this course is simple: to be a start to finish, end to end, complete look at how we can architect an application properly using modern patterns and techniques while taking advantage of the React library!</p>

                    <h3>So You Think You Know JavaScript?</h3>
                    <p>Do you want to dive into three of the trickiest aspects of the JavaScript language? From beginner to intermediate - this course will bring you up to speed on some of the must have knowledge of being able to write in it effectively, while demystifying some its most often-misunderstood constructs!
            
            In this course, you will learn all about scopes, â€œthisâ€, and prototypes! Training content often doesnâ€™t dive into the specifics of the nature of these â€œadvancedâ€ features. However, it is my belief that this is necessary knowledge to be an effective JavaScript programmer!
            
            My goal at the end of this course is that variable scoping, the usage of the â€œthisâ€ keyword, and the creation and use of prototypes is well understood from a ground up perspective without compromise. Simply by having a firm grasp on these aspects of the language, many issues that even years-long JavaScript developers face can be resolved easily!</p>

                    <p>In this series, Richard Morwood (XNA side-scroller) will teach you to track how users are interacting with your Unity project - but the core concepts can be extended to anything, be it websites or phone apps.
            
            It will use AWS Mobile Analytics for data capturing, S3 for data storage, Apache Spark running on DataBricks for transforming the data, and C# with Aurora for presenting the data back inside of Unity
            
            . All of this would be done using free tools and the AWS free tier.
            
            Richard, as well as his "student" Nick Carton, will dive deep into this project and give a very solid grounding in cloud computing, managed services, Data Warehousing, reporting, and Analysis!</p>
