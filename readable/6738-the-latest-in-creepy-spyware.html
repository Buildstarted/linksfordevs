</p><p>"The on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret and should have been listed in the tech specs," the spokesperson said. "That was an error on our part."</p></blockquote><p>Where are the consumer protection agencies? They should be all over this.</p><p>And while they're figuring out which laws Google broke, they should also look at American Airlines. Turns out that some of their seats have <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/american-airlines-planes-entertainment-system-cameras">built-in cameras</a>:</p><blockquote><p>American Airlines spokesperson Ross Feinstein confirmed to BuzzFeed News that cameras are present on some of the airlines' in-flight entertainment systems, but said "they have never been activated, and American is not considering using them." Feinstein added, "Cameras are a standard feature on many in-flight entertainment systems used by multiple airlines. Manufacturers of those systems have included cameras for possible future uses, such as hand gestures to control in-flight entertainment."</p></blockquote><p>That makes it all okay, doesn't it?</p><p>Actually, I kind of understand the airline seat camera thing. My guess is that whoever designed the in-flight entertainment system just specced a standard tablet computer, and they all came with unnecessary features like cameras. This is how we end up with refrigerators with Internet connectivity and Roombas with <a href="http://www.monohelixlabs.com/spying-on-roomba.html">microphones</a>. It's cheaper to leave the functionality in than it is to remove it.</p><p>Still, we need better disclosure laws.</p><p class="entry-tags">Tags: <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=air%20travel&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">air travel</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=alarms&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">alarms</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=Google&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=Internet%20of%20Things&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">Internet of Things</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=privacy&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">privacy</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=spyware&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">spyware</a>, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=surveillance&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1" rel="tag">surveillance</a></p><p class="posted"><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/03/the_latest_in_c.html">Posted on March  4, 2019 at  6:04 AM</a>
