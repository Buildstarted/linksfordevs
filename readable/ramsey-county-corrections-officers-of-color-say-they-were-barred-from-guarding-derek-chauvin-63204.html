A black acting sergeant who typically oversees the transport of high-profile inmates started a routine pat-down on Chauvin. Lydon instructed the sergeant to stop and replaced him with white officers, the charges say.</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                            
                                                                                                    <p>A fellow sergeant informed him that Lydon had ordered all minority employees from the fifth floor, where Chauvin was being held in isolation, and prohibited them from having any contact with Chauvin. In every case, white colleagues were swapped in to perform their normal duties.</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                            
                                                                                                    <p>Later that afternoon, officers of color gathered on the third floor to console one another about what they deemed a “segregation order.” Some were crying, charges say, while others were openly contemplating whether they should quit. Individuals who complained were told to take it up with Lydon.</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                            
                                                                                                    <p>In written statements, all eight staffers recount a meeting with Lydon where he admitted to banning officers of color from the fifth floor but denied being racist. He defended that decision, charges say, yet reversed the order within 45 minutes.</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                            
                                                                                                    <p>A union steward complained to top brass, prompting the internal investigation. During his interview, Lydon explained that he recognized Floyd’s death would “likely create acute racialized trauma” for minority staff and felt he had a duty to protect them from Chauvin. Lydon claimed the decision was not related to his workers’ professionalism or concerns over Chauvin’s safety.</p>

Chauvin was moved to the Hennepin County jail on May 31 and for security reasons transferred again to the Oak Park Heights maximum security prison, where he remains.</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                            
                                                                                                    <p>Nearly a week after the initial incident, dozens of jailers met with Sheriff Bob Fletcher and elected an acting sergeant to read a two-page letter on the behalf of the minority staff. The note recalled his confrontation with Lydon, the shock he felt upon being called “a liability” around Chauvin and the command to notify other officers of color that they were being reassigned to a different floor.</p>

He did not request Lydon’s termination, but said his judgment “caused us officers to lose faith in his ability to run this facility.”</p>

Employees claimed he never did.</p>

Sheriff’s office spokesman Roy Magnuson initially refused to name Lydon’s current position or divulge whether he’d been transferred. On Saturday, Magnuson said Lydon had been removed from his role as jail superintendent. He will now report to Undersheriff Bill Finney, who’s been tapped to run the Detention Division in the interim. Fletcher is “reviewing the matter to determine if any additional action is necessary,” Magnuson wrote in a statement.</p>
