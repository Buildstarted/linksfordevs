Intro</h1><div><div class="main"><p>djbsort is a new software library
for sorting arrays of integers or floating-point numbers.
It provides the following features:</p><p>These features are not separate options:
there is a single sorting function
that is simultaneously fast, secure, and verified.</p><p>The <a href="install.html">current release</a> of djbsort
has the following limitations:</p><ul><li><p>It sorts only signed 32-bit integers (<code>int32</code>),
  unsigned 32-bit integers (<code>uint32</code>),
  and 32-bit floating-point numbers (<code>float32</code>).
  However,
  the underlying techniques can easily be adapted
  to integers and floating-point numbers of other sizes
  (e.g., 64 bits).
  The techniques can also,
  with slightly more effort,
  permute fixed-size records
  or pointers to variable-size records
  along with the keys being sorted.</p></li><li><p>It requires the array to fit into RAM
  (plus swap space).
  However, the underlying techniques can easily be adapted to
  larger arrays,
  such as arrays stored on disk.
  The data-access pattern is quite regular, and
  standard techniques to further reduce disk accesses
  are applicable.</p></li><li><p>It sorts an array using one core on one machine,
  so the latency is suboptimal for large arrays.
  However, the underlying techniques can easily be parallelized
  across cores and across machines.</p></li><li><p>The speed is only for
  CPUs with the AVX2 instruction set
  (e.g., Intel Haswell).
  However,
  the underlying optimization techniques
  can easily be ported to other CPUs.</p></li><li><p>The verification has been tested
  for code produced by only a few compilers,
  and is likely to need changes
  to handle other compilers.
  It is possible that the C code
  has portability problems that damage correctness:
  for example,
  perhaps the C code triggers compiler bugs
  on some platforms.</p></li><li><p>The verification has been applied only
  to the <code>int32</code> software.</p></li><li><p>The verification does not check memory safety.</p></li><li><p>The verification runs separately for each array size,
  and becomes slower as the array size increases.
  On the other hand, this verification covers
  the specific array sizes used in cryptography.</p></li></ul><p>The djbsort author is
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djb.html">Daniel J. Bernstein</a>, University of Illinois at Chicago and Ruhr-University Bochum.</p><p>djbsort builds upon results from the following paper:
Daniel J. Bernstein, Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup, Tanja Lange, Christine van Vredendaal,
<a href="https://ntruprime.cr.yp.to/papers.html">"NTRU Prime: reducing attack surface at low cost"</a>,
Selected Areas in Cryptography 2017.
The NTRU Prime paper
explained how to make constant-time sorting software
run faster than Intel's sorting software on Intel CPUs,
and demonstrated this with a software release in 2017.
djbsort includes verification and provides another 3x speedup.</p><hr><span><b>Version:</b>
