He was provisionally suspended on June 13.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Russian forward Yevgeni Kuznetsov has received a 4-year suspension from the IIHF after testing positive for a banned substance at the 2019 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship. <a href="https://t.co/qLpqHGKlbT">https://t.co/qLpqHGKlbT</a></p><p>— IIHF (@IIHFHockey) <a href="https://twitter.com/IIHFHockey/status/1164870029327966208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2019</a></p></blockquote><p>The IIHF’s test result contradicts Kuznetsov’s assertion that he has never used drugs.</p><p>On May 27, the day after Kuznetsov’s IIHF test, <a href="https://russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2019/05/27/video-appears-to-show-evgeny-kuznetsov-with-cocaine/">a video posted to Twitter</a> appeared to show the Capitals center in an unspecified hotel room, in the presence of a white powder. Kuznetsov said the video was taken in the summer of 2018, in Las Vegas after the Capitals won the Stanley Cup. However, he denied using the substance.</p><p>“Yes, I saw the video on the internet,” Kuznetsov said in his response, which was posted to <a href="https://www.sport-express.ru/hockey/world/news/evgeniy-kuznecov-ya-nikogda-ne-upotreblyal-narkotiki-i-ne-sobirayus-esli-est-voprosy-gotov-proyti-medicinskuyu-ekspertizu-1549580/">sport-express.ru</a> and translated by RMNB’s Igor Kleyner. “I don’t necessarily have anything to do with what is going on around me. I never used drugs and have no intention to get into it. If there are any questions, I am ready to undergo testing.”</p><p>The Capitals and NHL conducted investigations and cleared Kuznetsov.</p><p>Cocaine <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/wada_2019_english_prohibited_list.pdf">falls under Section 6A of WADA’s list of prohibited substances.</a></p><p>The NHL only <a href="https://www.tsn.ca/all-nhl-player-doping-samples-tested-for-cocaine-this-season-nhlpa-says-1.735457">began formally testing all players for recreational drugs</a> such as cocaine or marijuana in 2017. The NHL, unlike its major sports-league counterparts the NFL, MLB, and NBA, does not prohibit the use of cocaine or suspend players who test positive for the drug.</p><p>Kuznetsov’s international suspension will lift on June 12, 2023. He will miss the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing (if the NHL participates) and he <a href="https://twitter.com/ikhurshudyan/status/1164897411996823553">will not be able to play in the KHL</a> if there is an NHL lockout.</p><p>The Russian center <a href="https://russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2019/08/21/evgeny-kuznetsov-deletes-all-posts-on-his-instagram-page/">recently deleted all the posts on his Instagram page</a> ahead of the announcement by the IIHF.</p><p>More from the IIHF:</p><blockquote><p>The IIHF has suspended Russian ice hockey player Yevgeni Kuznetsov for a violation of World Anti-Doping Code Article 2.1 (Presence of a Prohibited Substance).</p><p>The case concerns a test indicating a prohibited substance, cocaine, according to section S6.a (non-specified substance) of the World Anti-Doping Code 2019 Prohibited List. The prohibited substance was found in a doping control which occurred on 26 May 2019 at the 2019 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship.</p><p>The player didn’t require the analysis of his B-sample and was provisionally suspended on 13th June 2019.</p><p>The period of ineligibility to be imposed shall be four years, concluding on 12th June 2023. </p></blockquote><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong><a href="https://russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2019/08/23/evgeny-kuznetsov-statement-i-feel-absolutely-terrible-for-letting-you-down/">Evgeny Kuznetsov comments on his suspension</a></em></p><p><em>Headline photo: Elizabeth Kong</em></p></div></div></div></div>
