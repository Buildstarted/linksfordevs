    <div class="commtext">What is wrong in this case w/ multiple VPS&apos;s? For instance, I run a shipping system that our entire operation depends on. I can&apos;t afford downtime either, as that would shutdown our entire shipping department. However, 1 server running on-prem, 1 remote in shared hosting and 2 failover servers on DigitalOcean costs ~$120/month.<p>What would a managed cloud like AWS or Azure provide besides higher expenses? Last I checked, AWS would be ~$550/month based on their calculator.</p><p>IT departments managed redundancy long before cloud was a thing, and it&apos;s certainly possible to achieve acceptable uptime without the managed services. I realize that I still rely on DO for their uptime, and I&apos;m pricing renting rackspace for that reason. However, uptime is currently within acceptable levels (ie I haven&apos;t had to explain to the CEO why all his employees are standing around). We had tried 2 SaaS vendors before our current on-prem solution, and both had had downtime that cost us money. Both were hosted in AWS, so clearly that isn&apos;t the panacea for ultimate reliability. If our on-prem server goes down, I get a call. However, I got calls when our SaaS vendor went down as well; sitting on line with their tech support wasn&apos;t any great comfort.</p><p>The same graceful failover processes are accessible on machines you control, there&apos;s no reason that you have to run on one machine if you avoid the cloud. The biggest hurdle for me to implement this was database concurrency with multiple servers, but a cloud solution wouldn&apos;t have done anything to solve that problem.</p><p>[edit:] typos and miss-typed AWS pricing due to mobile keyboard.</p></div>
