    <h1>Atari is opening eight video game hotels across the U.S.</h1>
    <div class="cN X"><p>Just when you thought nostaliga-mining had already reached its peak: Atari is in talks to build <a class href="https://atarihotels.com/">a series of gaming hotels</a> across the country. The hotels, which will be created in conjunction with innovation and strategy company GSD Group and real estate company True North Studio, promise to be a &#x201C;one-of-a-kind video game-themed destination.&#x201D;</p><p>The hotels are planned for Phoenix, Las Vegas, Denver, Chicago, Austin, Seattle, San Francisco, and San Jose, and the first is set to break ground in mid-2020.</p><p><u>So wild it just might work &#x2014;</u> At first glance, a video game-themed hotel might sound too gimmicky to be anything other than an old company&#x2019;s pipe dream. But there&#x2019;s reason to believe that, if executed well, the Atari Hotel could actually work. As the company reports in its press release, more than $152 billion was spent on games last year alone. And games love to get together and compete. A hotel with this focus could be a huge draw for serious gamers and even families.</p><p><u>What will it <em>be</em>, though? &#x2014;</u> Atari hasn&#x2019;t released all that many details about the hotels. The company promises &#x201C;state-of-the-art venues and studios&#x201D; where esports and other gaming competitions can take place. There&#x2019;s also talk of both virtual and augmented reality gaming options, which would be a pretty big draw in and of itself. Notably, there&#x2019;s also no mention of whether or not classic Atari games will be playable at the hotels.</p><p>Atari also mentions restaurants, a movie theater, a gym, and space for business work. Eclectic, to say the least.</p></div>
