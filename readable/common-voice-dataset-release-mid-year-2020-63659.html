<p>We are halfway through 2020, and already it’s been an exciting year for Common Voice! Thanks to the enthusiasm and incredible engagement from our Common Voice communities, we are <a href="https://voice.mozilla.org/datasets">releasing an updated dataset <span title="578 clicks">578</span></a> with <strong>7,226 total hours</strong> of contributed voice data. 5,591 of these hours have been confirmed valid by our diligent contributors. Dataset fun fact: this release comprises over 5.5million clips*!</p>
<p>Not only is Common Voice growing, it’s continuing to diversify. This release includes voice recordings in <strong>54 languages</strong>, 14 of these languages** are new to the platform and dataset. The platform is seeing more languages with over 5,000 unique speakers*** and an increase in languages with over 500 recorded hours****. With contributions from all over the globe, you are helping us follow through on our goal to create a voice dataset that is publicly available to anyone and represents the world we live in.</p>
<p>We are also proud to announce the release of our first ever dataset target segment! In May, Common Voice started collecting voice data for a specific purpose or use case. Now, we’re releasing the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/help-create-common-voices-first-target-segment/59587">single word target segment <span title="74 clicks">74</span></a> which includes the digits <em>zero</em> through <em>nine</em>, as well as the words <em>yes</em>, <em>no</em>, <em>hey</em> and <em>Firefox</em>. The <a href="http://voice.mozilla.org/datasets">released target segment</a> is <strong>120 total recorded hours</strong>, with <strong>64 valid hours</strong>, across <strong>18 languages</strong>. It was created in one month by over 11,000 unique contributor voices! This segment data will help Mozilla benchmark the accuracy of our open source voice recognition engine, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech">Deep Speech <span title="152 clicks">152</span></a>, in multiple languages for a similar task and will enable more detailed feedback on how to continue improving the dataset.</p>
<p>From the whole Voice team at Mozilla: Thank you for your ongoing contributions, your support and your enthusiasm! Going into the second half of 2020, we look forward to continuing our mission to build a better, more open, internet.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Megan + the Common Voice team</p>
