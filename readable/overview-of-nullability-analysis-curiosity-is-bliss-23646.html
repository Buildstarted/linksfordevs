  <p>A regular Roslyn contributor, <a href="https://github.com/YairHalberstadt">Yair</a>, asked for some pointers about C# 8.0’s nullability analysis on the <a href="https://gitter.im/dotnet/roslyn">gitter</a> channel. I thought I’d expand on my reply and share it more broadly.</p>

<p>This post assumes familiarity with the “nullable reference types” feature, including the concepts of nullability <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/csharp-8.0/nullable-reference-types-specification.md#nullability-of-types">annotations</a> (annotated, not-annotated, oblivious) and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/csharp-8.0/nullable-reference-types-specification.md#null-state-and-null-tracking">states</a> (not-null, maybe-null).</p>

<h2 id="bound-trees">Bound trees</h2>

<p>The backbone of the compiler consists of four main stages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>parsing</em> source code into syntax trees,</li>
  <li>building symbols from declarations and <em>binding</em> the syntax of each method body into an initial bound tree,</li>
  <li><em>lowering</em> the bound tree into a set of simpler bound nodes,</li>
  <li><em>emitting</em> IL from the lowered bound nodes, along with some metadata.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nullability analysis rests on the initial bound tree. This tree has a structure similar to the syntax tree, but instead of referencing un-interpreted identifiers (like <code>x</code> or <code>Method</code>) it references symbols. Symbols are an object model for entities declared by a program or loaded from metadata. 
For example, symbols allow differentiating different uses of a given identifier in code. You could have a parameter <code>x</code>, a local <code>x</code>, a type <code>x</code> or even a method <code>x</code>. For each kind of symbol you can ask different questions, such as the type of the parameter or local, or the return and parameter types of a method.</p>

<p>When types are explicit in source (for example, <code>string nonNullLocal = "";</code>, <code>string? maybeNullLocal = "";</code> or <code>MakeArray&lt;string?&gt;(item)</code>), the bound nodes and symbols capture an explicit/declared nullability: <code>TypeWithAnnotations</code> with <code>Annotated</code> or <code>NotAnnotated</code> annotations in a <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/csharp-8.0/nullable-reference-types-specification.md#nullable-contexts">context</a> with nullability annotations enabled, or <code>Oblivious</code> in a disabled context.</p>

<p>When types are inferred (for example, in <code>var local = "";</code> or <code>MakeArray(item)</code>), the bound node just uses an <code>Oblivious</code> annotation, which the nullability analysis will later revise.</p>

<h2 id="nullablewalker">NullableWalker</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/src/Compilers/CSharp/Portable/FlowAnalysis/NullableWalker.cs"><code>NullableWalker</code></a> is responsible for most of the analysis. It is a visitor for the initial bound tree, which:</p>
<ol>
  <li>computes the nullability state of expressions (and save those to answer queries from the IDE),</li>
  <li>keeps track of knowledge for different variables (more on that below), and</li>
  <li>produces warnings.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="state-tracking">State tracking</h2>

<p>As the analysis progresses through a method body, <code>NullableWalker</code> tracks some knowledge for each variable (or more generally, storage location). At a certain point in the analysis, the state for a given variable is either <code>MaybeNull</code> or <code>NotNull</code>.
For all the tracked variables, this is represented as a state array, in which each variable gets an index/position/slot.</p>

<p>For instance, each parameter and local in a method gets a slot, which holds either a <code>NotNull</code> or <code>MaybeNull</code> state. Consider a parameter <code>string? p1</code>: we give it a slot/index and we’ll initialize its state to maybe-null (ie. <code>State[slot] = MaybeNull</code>, because its declared type is <code>Annotated</code>), then when we visit <code>p1 = "";</code> we can just override that state, and when we visit <code>p1.ToString()</code> we consult that state to decide whether to warn for possible null dereference.</p>

<p><code>NullableWalker</code> not only tracks variables, it also tracks fields, so it assigns slots for those too. That way, it can warn on <code>localStruct.field1.ToString()</code>, but not <code>localStruct.field2.ToString()</code> independently.
Such nested slots are known to have a containing slot. With that information, we can look at an assignment like <code>local2 = local1;</code> and we can not only copy the slot for <code>local1</code> to set the state of <code>local2</code>, but we can copy the nested slots thereby transfering all of our knowledge of <code>local1</code> to <code>local2</code>.</p>

<p>The state is generally just a simple array, but it can also be two arrays in some cases. That’s called “conditional state”. It is used for analyzing expressions like <code>x == null</code>. We keep track of the states “if the expression were true” and “if the expression were false” separately. Slots are still used to index into those arrays as normal.</p>

<p>Cloning states is another common operation. When analyzing <code>if (b) ... else ...</code>, we clone the state so that we can analyze each branch separately. We can merge those states when the branches rejoin (<code>Meet</code> takes the worst case values). That gives us the state following the <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<p>In code that isn’t reachable, as in <code>if (false) { ... unreachable ...}</code>, every value you read is <code>NotNull</code> regardless of tracked state to minimize warnings.</p>

<h2 id="simple-example">Simple example</h2>

<p>Let’s wrap up this overview by looking at an assignment, <code>x = y</code>. To analyze this expression, we’re going to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>visit the right-hand-side expression and get a <code>TypeWithState</code> back which tells us the null-state of <code>y</code> at this point in the program,</li>
  <li>visit the left-hand-side expression as an L-value (i.e., for assigning to) and get a <code>TypeWithAnnotations</code> back which tells us the declared type of <code>x</code> (not its state),</li>
  <li>we check if the assignment from the state of <code>y</code> to the declared type of <code>x</code> poses problems, both in terms of top-level nullability (for instance, are we assigning a <code>null</code> value to a un-annotated <code>string</code> variable?), or nested nullability (for example, are we assigning a <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> value to a <code>List&lt;string?&gt;</code> variable?),</li>
  <li>we update the state of <code>x</code> based on the state of <code>y</code>,</li>
  <li>return the state of <code>x</code> as the state of the assignment expression, in case it is a nested expression like <code>(x = y).ToString()</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In that example, <code>y</code> might not be a simple bound node for accessing <code>y</code>, but it could also involve implicit conversions. In that case, visiting <code>y</code> at the step (1) will visit a bound conversion which holds <code>y</code> as its operand. As long as the visit operation for each kind of bound node does its part (i.e., produce a <code>TypeWithState</code> for the expression, produce proper side effects on state and diagnostics) then this process composes well.</p>
