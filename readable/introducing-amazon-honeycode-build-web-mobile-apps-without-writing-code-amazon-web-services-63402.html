       <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc"><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/visicalc_1.jpg"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc">VisiCalc</a> was launched in 1979, and I purchased a copy (shown at right) for my Apple II. The spreadsheet model was clean, easy to use, and most of all, easy to teach. I was working in a retail computer store at that time, and knew that this product was a big deal when customers started asking to purchase the software, and for whatever hardware that was needed to run it.</p> 
       <p>Today’s spreadsheets fill an important gap between mass-produced packaged applications and custom-built code created by teams of dedicated developers. Every tool has its limits, however. Sharing data across multiple users and multiple spreadsheets is difficult, as is dealing with large amounts of data. Integration &amp; automation are also challenging, and require specialized skills. In many cases, those custom-built apps would be a better solution than a spreadsheet, but a lack of developers or other IT resources means that these apps rarely get built.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Introducing <span title="">Amazon Honeycode</span></strong></span><br> Today we are launching <a href="https://www.honeycode.aws/?&amp;trk=el_a134p000003yCxVAAU&amp;trkCampaign=pac-edm-2020-honeycode-homepage&amp;sc_channel=el&amp;sc_campaign=pac-edm-2020-honeycode-website_links-adoption-jeff_barr_blog_post_link&amp;sc_outcome=Enterprise_Digital_Marketing&amp;sc_geo=NAMER&amp;sc_country=US">Amazon Honeycode</a> in beta form. This new fully-managed AWS service gives you the power to build powerful mobile &amp; web applications without writing any code. It uses the familiar spreadsheet model and lets you get started in minutes. If you or your teammates are already familiar with spreadsheets and formulas, you’ll be happy to hear that just about everything you know about sheets, tables, values, and formulas still applies.</p> 
       <p><span title="">Amazon Honeycode</span> includes templates for some common applications that you and other members of your team can use right away:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_create_templates_1.png" width="170" height="346"></p> 
       <p>You can customize these apps at any time and the changes will be deployed immediately. You can also start with an empty table, or by importing some existing data in CSV form. The applications that you build with <span title="">Honeycode</span> can make use of a rich palette of user interface objects including lists, buttons, and input fields:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_ui_palette_1.png" width="324" height="713"></p> 
       <p>You can also take advantage of a repertoire of built-in, trigger-driven actions that can generate email notifications and modify tables:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_trigger_1.png" width="786" height="746"></p> 
       <p><span title="">Honeycode</span> also includes a lengthy list of <a href="https://honeycodecommunity.aws/t/honeycode-functions/90">built-in functions</a>. The list includes many functions that will be familiar to users of existing spreadsheets, along with others that are new to <span title="">Honeycode</span>. For example, <a href="https://honeycodecommunity.aws/t/findrow-a-better-vlookup/120"><code>FindRow</code></a> is a more powerful version of the popular <code>Vlookup</code> function.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Getting Started with <span title="">Honeycode</span></strong></span><br> It is easy to get started. I visit the <a href="https://builder.honeycode.aws/">Honeycode Builder</a>, and create my account:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_create_account_1.png" width="799" height="819"></p> 
       <p>After logging in I see <strong>My Drive</strong>, with my workbooks &amp; apps, along with multiple search, filter, &amp; view options:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_my_drive_2.png"></p> 
       <p>I can open &amp; explore my existing items, or I can click <strong>Create workbook</strong> to make something new. I do that, and then select the <strong>Simple To-do</strong> template:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_templates_2.png" width="450" height="549"></p> 
       <p>The workbook, tables, and the apps are created and ready to use right away. I can simply clear the sample data from the tables and share the app with the users, or I can inspect and customize it. Let’s inspect it first, and then share it!</p> 
       <p>After I create the new workbook, the <strong>Tasks</strong> table is displayed and I can see the sample data:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_stdo_tasks_tab_1.png" width="900" height="321"></p> 
       <p>Although this looks like a traditional spreadsheet, there’s a lot going on beneath the surface. Let’s go through, column-by-column:</p> 
       <p><strong>A (Task)</strong> – Plain text.</p> 
       <p><strong>B (Assignee)</strong> – Text, formatted as a Contact.</p> 
       <p><strong>C (First Name)</strong> – Text, computed by a formula:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_tasks_formula_c_1.png" width="365" height="142"></p> 
       <p>In the formula, <strong>Assignee</strong> refers to column B, and <strong>First Name</strong> refers to the first name of the contact.</p> 
       <p><strong>D (Due)</strong> – A date, with multiple formatting options:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_tasks_date_formats_1.png" width="290" height="308"></p> 
       <p><strong>E (Done)</strong> – A picklist that pulls values from another table, and that is formatted as a <span title="">Honeycode</span> <strong>rowlink</strong>. Together, this restricts the values in this column to those found in the other table (<strong>Done</strong>, in this case, with the values <strong>Yes</strong> and <strong>No</strong>), and also makes the values from that table visible within the context of this one:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_tasks_pickles_1.png" width="342" height="309"></p> 
       <p><strong>F (Remind On)</strong> – Another picklist, this one taking values from the <strong>ReminderOptions</strong> table:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_tasks_remopt_1.png" width="300" height="449"></p> 
       <p><strong>G (Notification)</strong> – Another date.</p> 
       <p>This particular table uses just a few of the features and options that are available to you.</p> 
       <p>I can use the icons on the left to explore my workbook:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_tasks_menu_1.png" width="219" height="246"></p> 
       <p>I can see the tables:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_tasks_tables_1.png" width="342" height="409"></p> 
       <p>I can also see the apps. A single <span title="">Honeycode</span> workbook can contain multiple apps that make use of the same tables:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_tasks_apps_1.png" width="358" height="353"></p> 
       <p>I’ll return to the apps and the App Builder in a minute, but first I’ll take a look at the automations:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_tasks_autos_1.png" width="338" height="278"></p> 
       <p>Again, all of the tables and apps in the workbook can use any of the automations in the workbook.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>The <span title="">Honeycode</span> App Builder</strong></span><br> Let’s take a closer look at the app builder. As was the case with the tables, I will show you some highlights and let you explore the rest yourself. Here’s what I see when I open my <strong>Simple To-do</strong> app in the builder:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_bld_main_1.png" width="800" height="781"></p> 
       <p>This app contains four screens (<strong>My Tasks</strong>, <strong>All Tasks</strong>, <strong>Edit</strong>, and <strong>Add Task</strong>). All screens have both web and mobile layouts. Newly created screens, and also those in this app, have the layouts linked, so that changes to one are reflected in the other. I can unlink the layouts if I want to exercise more control over the controls, the presentation, or to otherwise differentiate the two:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_bld_unlink_1.png" width="345" height="266"></p> 
       <p>Objects within a screen can reference data in tables. For example, the List object on the <strong>My Task</strong> screen filters rows of the <strong>Tasks</strong> table, selecting the undone tasks and ordering them by the due date:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_bld_tasks_filter_1.png" width="801" height="463"></p> 
       <p>Here’s the source expression:</p> 
       <div> 
        <pre data-language="C"><code><span>=</span><span>Filter</span><span>(</span>Tasks<span>,</span><span>"Tasks[Done]&lt;&gt;% ORDER BY Tasks[Due]"</span><span>,</span><span>"Yes"</span><span>)</span></code></pre> 
       </div> 
       <p>The “%”&nbsp; in the filter condition is replaced by the second parameter (“Yes”) when the filter is evaluated. This substitution system makes it easy for you to create interesting &amp; powerful filters using the <a href="https://honeycodecommunity.aws/t/filter/923"><code>FILTER()</code></a> function.</p> 
       <p><code></code>When the app runs, the objects within the List are replicated, one per task:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_app_my_tasks_1.png" width="800" height="728"></p> 
       <p>Objects on screens can initiate run automations and initiate actions. For example, the <strong>ADD TASK</strong> button navigates to the <strong>Add Task</strong> screen:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_bld_add_button_1.png" width="800" height="710"></p> 
       <p>The <strong>Add Task</strong> screen prompts for the values that specify the new task, and the <strong>ADD</strong> button uses an automation that writes the values to the <strong>Tasks</strong> table:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_bld_automation_add_1.png" width="300" height="589"></p> 
       <p>Automations can be triggered in four different ways. Here’s the automation that generates reminders for tasks that have not been marked as done. The automation runs once for each row in the <strong>Tasks</strong> table:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_reminder_auto_1.png" width="700" height="605"></p> 
       <p>The notification runs only if the task has not been marked as done, and could also use the <code>FILTER()</code> function:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_reminder_auto_note_1.png" width="701" height="573"></p> 
       <p>While I don’t have the space to show you how to build an app from scratch, here’s a quick overview.</p> 
       <p>Click <strong>Create workbook</strong> and <strong>Import CSV file</strong> or <strong>Start from scratch</strong>:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_create_1.png" width="304" height="275"></p> 
       <p>Click the <strong>Tables</strong> icon and create reference and data tables:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_tables_1.png" width="699" height="274"></p> 
       <p>Click the <strong>Apps</strong> icon and build the app. You can select a wizard that uses your tables as a starting point, or you can start from an empty canvas.</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_apps_1.png" width="450" height="265"></p> 
       <p>Click the <strong>Automations</strong> icon and add time-driven or data-driven automations:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_automations_1.png" width="499" height="230"></p> 
       <p>Share the app, as detailed in the next section.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Sharing Apps</strong></span><br> After my app is ready to go, I can share it with other members of my team. Each <span title="">Honeycode</span> user can be a member of one or more teams:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_teams_1.png" width="350" height="351"></p> 
       <p>To share my app, I click <strong>Share app</strong>:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_share_button_1.png" width="241" height="220"></p> 
       <p>Then I search for the desired team members and share the app:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_share_george_1.png" width="600" height="423"></p> 
       <p>They will receive an email that contains a link, and can start using the app immediately. Users with mobile devices can install the Honeycode Player (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1502619411">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.aws.honeycode">Android</a>) and make use of any apps that have been shared with them. Here’s the Simple To-do app:</p> 
       <p><img src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/hc_mobile_2.png" width="896" height="633"></p> 
       <p><span><strong><span title="">Amazon Honeycode</span> APIs</strong></span><br> External applications can also use the <a href="https://honeycodecommunity.aws/t/honeycode-apis/127">Honeycode APIs</a> to interact with the applications you build with <span title="">Honeycode</span>. The functions include:</p> 
       <p><code>GetScreenData</code> – Retrieve data from any screen of a <span title="">Honeycode</span> application.</p> 
       <p><code>InvokeScreenAutomation</code> – Invoke an automation or action defined in the screen of a <span title="">Honeycode</span> application.</p>
