            From ‚Äòdotnet run‚Äô to ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù - Matt Warren

Have you ever stopped to think about all the things that happen when you execute a simple .NET program?

This talk will delve into the internals of the recently open-sourced .NET Core runtime, looking at what happens, when it happens and why.

Making use of freely available tools such as 'PerfView', we'll examine the Execution Engine, Type Loader, Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler and the CLR Hosting API to see how all these components play a part in making 'Hello World' possible.



Matt is a Microsoft MVP based in UK, and a C# dev who loves nothing more than finding and fixing performance issues. He‚Äôs worked with Azure, ASP.NET MVC and WinForms on projects for storing government weather data, medical monitoring devices and an inspection system that ensured kegs of beer didn‚Äôt leak! He‚Äôs previously been an Open Source Contributor to BenchmarkDotNet and RavenDB, nowadays he mostly blogs about the ‚ÄòInternals‚Äô of the .NET Runtime at http://mattwarren.org. Matt currently works on the Contrast Security and lives near Pinewood Film Studios (home of James Bond) with his wife and 2 kids.
