He wrote the final dialogue in the panels themselves for the letterer to letter over, which leaves a mystery as to why he was writing those notes in the margins to himself. The prevailing theory is that he jotted them down hastily during the same meeting that Kirby was verbally explaining the story to him.</p><p>However, it seems just verbally explaining wasn’t working, so Kirby started writing things down. These early notes were pretty concise, but they gradually became more and more detailed as years went on, possibly in an attempt to safeguard the story from being misunderstood by Lee. However, it didn’t keep Lee from just ignoring and/or changing the intent of a story.&nbsp;</p><p>Kirby wasn’t the first to write story notes to Stan in the margins. <i>Daredevil</i> #1, published three months earlier, contains margin notes that are likely from artist Bill Everett. Steve Ditko may’ve been writing notes even earlier, though to the best of my knowledge he wrote on a separate sheet of paper and never in the margins, so we may never know for sure.</p><p><b>Avengers #6 (Page 20)</b></p><p>The earliest known issue to contain Kirby margin notes is <i>Avengers</i> #6. In the example at top, Kirby has written&nbsp;“Gonna finish off Black Knight,” the character Thor was fighting on the previous page. Since the note is written from Thor’s perspective, it’s possible he wanted Stan to write something dramatic for Thor to say while charging at the villain.</p><p>On the right I’ve adjusted the levels so you can read the note more easily. Also notice how you can see that Kirby originally drew Thor’s right leg going straight behind him.</p><p><b>Fantastic Four #28 (Page 2)</b></p><p>Above this panel, Kirby helpfully reminds forgetful Stan Lee that “Torch knows Iceman,” who met in an issue of <i>Strange Tales</i> also drawn by Kirby.</p><p>On the right there’s a note pointing to the newspaper, but it was chopped off when the art boards were trimmed. I can only assume it’s a note about what the headline should say, and it appears to be in Lee’s handwriting rather than Kirby’s.</p></div></div></div></div>
