<p>The new issue of .NET R&amp;D Digest (July, 2020) is here (yeah, it is that simple this time).</p>



<p>This issue includes bits of computer science (even a link to a paper!), software development and a few learning resources which you can use to learn something new! Ah, yeah, and .NET of course üòä</p>



<p>Enjoy and have a great weekend!</p>



<h2>Computer Science</h2>



<ol type="1"><li><a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2019/02/08/faster-remainders-when-the-divisor-is-a-constant-beating-compilers-and-libdivide/">Faster remainders when the divisor is a constant: beating compilers and libdivide</a><br>It is quite well-known that in mathematics you can do a lot of interesting things üôÇ probably, one of the most obvious examples is an ability to replace division with multiplication. In real life, this doesn‚Äôt sound quite useful, however, in computers, division is more expensive than multiplication, so such ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù can be quite beneficial. That is why compilers and libraries try to use this optimization whenever possible (division by constant, division by power of 2, ‚Ä¶, etc.). In this post <a href="https://twitter.com/lemire">Daniel Lemire</a> describes the general case of how to replace division with multiplication for signed and unsigned integers. The post doesn‚Äôt include complex math, which makes it very easy to read and get the general idea but if you need more details, there is a corresponding <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01961">paper</a> üôÇ</li></ol>



<h2>Software Development</h2>



<ol type="1"><li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-threat-modelling.html">A Guide to Threat Modelling for Developers</a><br>In modern software development world security is everyone‚Äôs responsibility. However, when it comes to real project it is easier to say than implement. One of the main reasons behind that is a lack of understanding of how to make everyone involved in the project closer to security questions. In this post <a href="https://twitter.com/jgumbley">Jim Gumbley</a> shares a detailed guide about how you can start doing ‚ÄúThreat modeling sessions‚Äù and bring security closer to everyone in your team and project in overall. This guide addresses the questions of who should be included, how these sessions should be conducted and what should be the outcome. In addition to detailed descriptions every section is covered by a realistic example.</li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/STKCRSUsyP0">The Many Meanings of Event-Driven Architecture</a><br>When it comes to architecture discussion it is always important to ensure everyone who is involved in the conversation has the same understanding of what this or this architecture pattern and term means. This may sound strange at the first glance, but you can easily experience this by trying to talk with a colleague about SOA or REST. In this video (from a conference) <a href="https://twitter.com/martinfowler">Martin Fowler</a> talks about event-driven architecture. Well, about several things which are usually meant when you speak about event-driven architecture. Besides presenting a different architectures Martin also talks about their pros, cons and reasons to use or not to use each of them.</li></ol>



<h2>Windows</h2>



<ol type="1"><li><a href="https://scorpiosoftware.net/2020/07/17/creating-registry-links/">Creating Registry Links</a><br>Windows Registry is very well-known. I think, almost every developer at least once in their life has ‚Äútweaked it for good‚Äù üôÇ Many of us, who have been in desktop development probably used it to store application settings or read different system values to perform correct application initialization, enable or disable features. But have you ever heard about registry link? In this post <a href="https://twitter.com/zodiacon">Pavel Yosifovich</a> explains what registry links are and how you can create or delete them using‚Ä¶ well, a bit of magic, a custom tool and some Windows API.</li></ol>



<h2>Visual Studio</h2>



<ol type="1"><li><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/how-do-i-think-about-async-code/">How Do I Think About Async Code?!</a>, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/how-do-i-debug-async-code-in-visual-studio/">How Do I Debug Async Code in Visual Studio?</a> and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugging-async-code-parallel-stacks-for-tasks/">Debugging Async Code: Parallel Stacks for Tasks</a><br>In last few years asynchronous programming became so popular that it looks like everyone knows about it and knows how to use it. However, it is not entirely true. There are many developers who had no chance to use it or have a very little experience with it. In this case, how to get started? ‚Äì Just read some posts üôÇ In these posts <a href="https://twitter.com/lyrichardson01">Leslie Richardson</a> provides a very intuitive and easy to get explanation of how you can think about asynchronous code and when you wrote it ‚Äì how you can debug it.</li><li><a href="https://www.meziantou.net/comparing-files-using-visual-studio.htm">Visual Studio Tips and Tricks</a><br>Visual Studio is very powerful. However, with this power also comes the complexity. Visual Studio has so many functions and tricks inside, so it is almost impossible to remember them all (and sometimes, it can do things we could never think of). In this series <a href="https://twitter.com/meziantou">G√©rald Barr√©</a> shares multiple Visual Studio gems you can utilize in everyday development.</li></ol>



<h2>.NET</h2>



<ol type="1"><li><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-5/">Performance Improvements in .NET 5</a><br>Performance improvements can come in different forms: in a form of new API or components you can now use to efficiently solve the ‚Äúslow‚Äù task, in form of support of ‚Äúnew and shiny‚Äù technology or protocol that you can now incorporate in your application or (I my opinion this is the best form) in form of runtime / framework improvement which simply, make you application faster at zero cost (yeah, you still has to install new framework and recompile the app, but this is almost no costs). In this huge post <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentoub">Stephen Toub</a> describes a numerous, stunning performance improvement we could expect to ship with the .NET 5 release. Most of these improvements are related to runtime (GC, JIT) and framework libraries (the ‚Äúthird form‚Äù) but there are also new tools (i.e. the linker) and new components which will help us make our apps better.</li><li><a href="https://tooslowexception.com/the-danger-of-asyncawait-and-result-in-one-picture/">The danger of async/await and .Result in one picture</a><br>As .NET developer you‚Äôve probably heard about ‚Äúsync over async‚Äù and how bad it is, about how it can cause a deadlock. You‚Äôve probably saw some code sample which demonstrate this ‚Äúawful‚Äù thing in action‚Ä¶ and most probably read the explanation but what about diagrams? In this post <a href="https://twitter.com/konradkokosa">Konrad Kokosa</a> illustrates the whole danger of ‚Äúsync over async‚Äù in two pictures, both ‚Äúworth a thousand words‚Äú.</li><li><a href="https://andrewlock.net/customising-aspnetcore-identity-without-editing-the-pagemodel/">Customizing the ASP.NET Core default UI without editing the PageModels</a><br>Most of the software we write are unique, however, they are also have a lot in common. Such common things are usually separated in reusable components which we use from project to project. Usually, there components are well-done and implemented with latest technologies and best practices. However, usually these components are quite hard to customize. In this post <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewlocknet">Andrew Lock</a> describes a way to customize one of such reusable pieces ‚Äì ASP.NET Core Identity, in particular, he explains how you can customize default UI without having to take ownership of code behind.</li><li><a href="https://jimmybogard.com/building-end-to-end-diagnostics-and-tracing-a-primer/">Building End-to-End Diagnostics and Tracing</a><br>Since microservices emerged into masses the amount of distributed applications increased dramatically. However, with all the benefits, distribution has its own costs ‚Äì and one of the major one is overall system and diagnostics complexity. In this series <a href="https://twitter.com/jbogard">Jimmy Bogard</a> demonstrates how you can introduce diagnostics and tracing into .NET Core based distributed application. The demonstrated solution is build using NServiceBus, OpenTelemetry SDK for .NET and standard .NET Activity API. The series isn‚Äôt over, so subscribe keep looking for the updates.</li><li><a href="https://tooslowexception.com/await-false-await-true/">await false &amp; await true</a><br>async-await keywords are very close to Tasks. A lot of guidelines you may find will say something like: ‚ÄúIn order to make method awaitable it should return <code>Task</code> or <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>‚Äú. Well, some of them may also include ‚Äú<code>ValueTask</code>‚Äú. But you aren‚Äôt limited to these types. In this post <a href="https://twitter.com/konradkokosa">Konrad Kokosa</a> demonstrates (just for fun, please do not repeat in real projects) how you can make <code>bool</code>.. well, awaitable üôÇ If you are interesting in how all this machinery works, I recommend you read this <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/dissecting-the-async-methods-in-c/">series</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/STeplyakov">Sergey Tepliakov</a>.</li><li><a href="https://andrewlock.net/setting-global-authorization-policies-using-the-defaultpolicy-and-the-fallbackpolicy-in-aspnet-core-3/">Setting global authorization policies using the DefaultPolicy and the FallbackPolicy in ASP.NET Core 3.x</a><br>Applications we write are tend to evolve. We introduce new features, new design. We improve or replace existing workflows. We do this to make sure our users benefit the most. Exactly the same evolution process also applies to the frameworks. In this post <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewlocknet">Andrew Lock</a> describes how you can update your authorization configuration code to benefit from new endpoint based authorization mechanism introduced in ASP.NET Core 3.x.</li></ol>



<h2>Learning</h2>



<ol type="1"><li><a href="https://github.com/ahmadmustafaanis/Machine-Learning-Path/">Machine Learning Path</a><br>Days ago machine learning wasn‚Äôt about day to day software development and was mostly a field for computer scientists and enthusiasts. However, things change and now you can find machine learning in quite ordinary products. But one thing still differs ML from learning one more development technology ‚Äì you need math, which makes it harder to start. Besides the above link you will find a list of courses and books, composed by <a href="https://twitter.com/AhmadMustafaAn1">Ahmad Mustafa Anis</a>, which will help you to get started with machine learning from scratch.</li><li><strong>.NET Garbage Collection with Midnight </strong>(<a href="https://twitter.com/maoni0/status/1282491235144351745">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/maoni0/status/1285028264612818946">Part 2</a>)<br>Have you ever ask yourself ‚ÄúWhat GC does on process initialization?‚Äù. If yes, then you should know ‚Äì you are not alone. Recently, Midnight asked Maoni the same question üôÇ In these short clips <a href="https://twitter.com/maoni0">Maoni Stephens</a> provides an information dense explanations of what GC does on process initialization and why every generation starts with an empty object. Currently there are only two clips, however, I hope there will be more. At meantime, you can find a lot about GC in ‚Äú<a href="https://prodotnetmemory.com/">the book</a>‚Äú.</li><li><a href="https://blazor-university.com/">Blazor University</a><br>When starting with a new technology it is critical to learn not only a practical aspect of how to do a particular thing you need right now but also it is important to get understanding of how technology works and what it can do in general. The second very important point it to find a learning path. Of course it is always possible to learn on case by cases basis but this usually leaves you with shattered knowledge which you have to glue yourself later. This site by <a href="https://github.com/mrpmorris">Peter Morris</a> provides addresses exactly these things when it comes to learning Blazor. The site isn‚Äôt complete, there are still topics to cover, however, it is a very good place to start with Blazor. Besides decent explanation it also includes source codes for many samples.</li></ol>
