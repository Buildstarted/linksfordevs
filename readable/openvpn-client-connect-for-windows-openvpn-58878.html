This is the recommended client program for the OpenVPN Access Server to enable VPN for Windows. The latest version of OpenVPN for Windows is available on our website.</p>
<p>If you have an OpenVPN Access Server, it is recommended to download the OpenVPN Connect client software directly from your own Access Server, as it will then come pre configured for use for VPN for Windows. The version available here contains no configuration to make a connection, although it can be used to update an existing installation and retain settings.</p>

        <div id="questions-collapse-Can the new and old client co-exist?" aria-labelledby="heading-Can the new and old client co-exist?" data-parent="#questions">
          <p>Yes, you may continue to use both v2 and v3 on the same connect device and import the profiles desired into each. If you like, you can run either one or both.</p>

        <div id="questions-collapse-Can I connect to multiple servers at the same time?" aria-labelledby="heading-Can I connect to multiple servers at the same time?" data-parent="#questions">
          <p>No, the client cannot connect to multiple servers at once. It does support multiple connection profiles, giving you the option to switch easily from one server to the next, but you can only be connected to one at a time. This is by design, to prevent unexpected traffic paths when connecting to multiple VPN servers at the same time. If you are a system administrator and you require a complex setup where multiple connections are active at the same time, there is the option to use the open source community OpenVPN client software available from our website.</p>

<p>The OpenVPN client v2 is called “OpenVPN Connect Client” and has been in use for many years. It is still available from our website and offered in the OpenVPN Access Server client web interface itself.</p>
<p>The OpenVPN client v3 is called “OpenVPN Connect” and is the latest generation of our software. It is available on our website as a beta version, and will be included soon in Access Server releases.</p>

        <div id="questions-collapse-Why am I getting a certificate error? How can I fix using a self signed certificate?" aria-labelledby="heading-Why am I getting a certificate error? How can I fix using a self signed certificate?" data-parent="#questions">
          <p>OpenVPN Access Server starts with a self-signed certificate. With this, you will receive warnings from your web browser about the site not being secure as well as a certificate error when importing a profile with the Connect Client. You can simply override the warnings or add an exception for your web browser. To resolve this, you can set up a DNS host name that resolves to the public address of your Access Server and <a href="https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/installing-a-valid-ssl-web-certificate-in-access-server/">install a valid SSL certificate</a> that corresponds to that DNS host name. Going forward, you would use that hostname to access your server instead of the IP address. This is also the recommended method as validated SSL certificates can only ever function with a valid public DNS hostname.</p>

      <div>
        
        <div id="questions-collapse-Where do I find my Access Server Hostname and credentials?" aria-labelledby="heading-Where do I find my Access Server Hostname and credentials?" data-parent="#questions">
          <div>
                        <p>Your Access Server Hostname is the address at which your Access Server can be reached. For example it could be <a href="https://vpn.yourcompany.com/" target="_blank">https://vpn.yourcompany.com/</a>. If a DNS hostname is not set up, it is also possible to specify the IP address where your Access Server. For example: <a href="https://55.193.55.55/" target="_blank">https://55.193.55.55</a></p>
<p>Your credentials are your username and password. You may need to get that information from your Access Server administrator if you don’t know it.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
            
      <div>
        
        <div id="questions-collapse-What do I enter for “Title”?" aria-labelledby="heading-What do I enter for “Title”?" data-parent="#questions">
          <p>Title is the name for the profile. It is automatically defined as the username with the hostname or IP address(example: user1@hostname). It differentiates between multiple profiles. You can define it manually as well. The title can be anything you want is just so you can see which profile is which.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
            
      <div>
        
        <div id="questions-collapse-What does “import autologin profile” mean?" aria-labelledby="heading-What does “import autologin profile” mean?" data-parent="#questions">
          <p>Choosing this option allows you to import an autologin profile with the address and credentials for your Access Server, then simply start the connection with the tap of a button. You would not need to re-enter credentials each time you connect. The autoprofile itself contains an embedded secure certificate that identifies and authorizes your connection automatically. It is an optional setting on the OpenVPN Access Server that the administrator of the server can choose to make available to you. If you find you cannot import the autologin profile, your administrator may not have allowed autologin through user permissions.</p>

      </div>
            
      <div>
        
        <div id="questions-collapse-Why did I get this message: “In this version compression was disabled by default. If you need it, please re-enable this setting.”" aria-labelledby="heading-Why did I get this message: “In this version compression was disabled by default. If you need it, please re-enable this setting.”" data-parent="#questions">
          <div>
                        <p>During investigation of a vulnerability called VORACLE, it was found that using compression to make the data that goes through the VPN tunnel smaller, and thus faster, has an adverse effect on security. To learn more about this see our security notification on our website regarding <a href="https://openvpn.net/security-advisory/the-voracle-attack-vulnerability/">the VORACLE attack vulnerability</a>.</p>
<p>In order to protect our customers, we are disabling compression by default. Some servers of the open source variety can be configured in such a way that the client must do compression, or else the client may not connect successfully. In such a case, you should get the server updated to disable compression. But we understand that this is not always possible, and you may need to be able to connect to such a server. In that event you can go into the settings and re-enable compression.</p>
