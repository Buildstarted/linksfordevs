<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="release_body_p"><p>Richmond, Surrey, UK, 0900 hours, 26 March 2019 – Australian web security expert Troy Hunt has been revealed as the latest industry luminary to be selected to join the Infosecurity Hall of Fame. He will be inducted into the Hall of Fame at <a href="https://www.infosecurityeurope.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Infosecurity Europe</a>, Europe’s number one information security event. </p><p>

Troy’s inclusion in the Infosecurity Hall of Fame recognises his contribution to the advancement of information security, education and good practice as an industry advocate, through his security research, public education, blogging and outreach work. In addition to creating courses for online education provider Pluralsight, Troy is a Microsoft Regional Director and MVP of Developer Security, and he speaks at events and trains technology professionals across the globe. Troy is also the creator of Have I Been Pwned - a free data breach search website which enables non-technical consumers to discover whether their data has been compromised.</p><p>

Established in 2008, the Infosecurity Hall of Fame recognises the pioneers who have made a significant and long-term contribution to information security on a global level. It acknowledges and celebrates the achievements of these visionaries, luminaries, practitioners, advocates and thought leaders who have provided intellectual or practical input that has shifted the advancement of the industry.</p><p>

Troy will be officially inducted during a session on the Keynote Stage on 11.20-12.10 on Thursday 6th June, when he will deliver the Hall of Fame Annual Lecture on the topic of Rise of the Breaches. </p><p>

Troy Hunt said: ‘A huge amount of the work many of us do in the industry is solitary. Being inducted into the Hall of Fame is recognition that our efforts have been noticed and have made a positive difference to the community. That’s an enormously fulfilling feeling. I’ve always looked at Infosecurity Europe as the standout event in the region for catching up on what’s happening in the broader industry. There’s a huge amount of value in the knowledge sharing that goes on. For me, the ‘hallway track’ is one of the most valuable aspects; I love having the opportunity to meet with peers and engage in ad hoc conversations and have built a lot of long-lasting valuable relationships. The connections people make will help drive the next generation of meaningful solutions in the industry.’</p><p>

Nicole Mills, Exhibition Director of Infosecurity Europe, said: “The history of computing and information security has been written by many brilliant minds who have dedicated their lives to its advancement. Troy Hunt epitomises this, having devoted his career to building knowledge, skills and capabilities among technology professionals across the globe – something that’s becoming ever more critical as the cyber security skills shortage continues to bite. He has also made a significant contribution to increasing public understanding of their exposure to data breaches, and the fundamentals of how to safeguard themselves. We are truly delighted to confirm Troy’s induction into the Infosecurity Europe Hall of Fame.”</p><p>

The theme of Troy Hunt’s Hall of Fame Annual Lecture will be ‘Rise of the Breaches’. In it, he will give visitors a look inside the world of data breaches, based on his experiences dealing with billions of breached records. He’ll share what’s motivating hackers, how they’re gaining access to data and how organisations are dealing with the aftermath of attacks. Most importantly, Troy’s insights will help visitors to contextualise these incidents and understand both what these attacks actually look like and how to defend against them.</p><p>
