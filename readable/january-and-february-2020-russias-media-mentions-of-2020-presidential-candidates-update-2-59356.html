<p><span>By Rachel Chernaskey</span></p>
<p><span>Since </span><a href="https://www.fpri.org/fie/november-and-december-2019-russias-media-mentions-of-2020-presidential-candidates-update-1/"><span>FIE 2020’s last update on Russian state-sponsored media</span></a><span>, the 2020 election landscape has evolved considerably—some candidates have dropped out, others have surged. As the candidates weathered the </span><a href="https://www.fpri.org/fie/russian-media-iowa-caucuses/"><span>Iowa caucuses</span></a><span> and subsequent primaries, Kremlin media shifted its coverage of the race to advance new narratives, both about the candidates themselves and the integrity of U.S. elections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kremlin media continued its pattern of negative coverage for establishment Democratic candidates, and unfavorable mentions for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg increased noticeably. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Amy Klobuchar and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg also continued to receive more negative coverage than positive from RT and Sputnik News (see Figure 12 below for data on mentions for </span><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/national/" onclick="javascript:window.open('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/national/'); return false;"><span>candidates polling at 5% or more nationally</span></a><span>).</span></p>
<p><span>Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s coverage represents the most significant change in Kremlin content. Russian state media is particularly sharp toward Bloomberg: 55% of his total mentions were negative, the highest percentage in the field. Such negative coverage of Vice President Biden (who received the highest total count of negative mentions among Democrats) was expected. Putin’s administration naturally characterizes Biden in 2020—a centrist, establishment Democrat from the Obama era—as it did Clinton in 2016: an adversary. But Bloomberg, a one-time moderate Republican who rarely talks foreign policy would not necessarily be a Kremlin opponent if elected the way Biden would be. </span></p>
<p><span>This Kremlin denigration of Bloomberg suggests their media coverage is not so much for the long-term purposes of shaping foreign policy or to “create chaos,” but rather supports last week’s revelations that U.S. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/us/politics/russian-interference-trump-democrats.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;fbclid=IwAR1svOWR8ocLSQp3hdv53AXfmz1YkvDsQypIXJx0ceaLFLLviJZNYz01Ang" onclick="javascript:window.open('https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/us/politics/russian-interference-trump-democrats.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;fbclid=IwAR1svOWR8ocLSQp3hdv53AXfmz1YkvDsQypIXJx0ceaLFLLviJZNYz01Ang'); return false;"><span>officials briefed</span></a><span> the House Intelligence Committee that the Kremlin favors Trump and separately notified the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/us/politics/bernie-sanders-russia.html" onclick="javascript:window.open('https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/us/politics/bernie-sanders-russia.html'); return false;"><span>Sanders campaign</span></a><span> that the Kremlin may be boosting them in some way.
