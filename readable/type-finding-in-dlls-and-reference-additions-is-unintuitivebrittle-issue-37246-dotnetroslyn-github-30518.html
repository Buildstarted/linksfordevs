<p>The final state told roslyn to use those paths to analyze/compile this project, which is correct. It did not tell roslyn to copy/paste the paths into other projects, which is not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At one point in time it very much was.  When we were originally writing features like add-using and whatnot, these were the abstractions that were designed in close concert with the IDE/project system.</p>
<p>Later on new abstractions were added but i don't recall <em>any</em> meetings with IDE to discuss what they were, what the user experience should be around them, and how it would affect features.</p>
<p>Note: this affected more than just what goes in the project, it also affected the language itself.  For example, there were teams that wanted 'add using' disabled because in their model of how C# was used they didn't want people manually adding 'usings', but would instead inject it themselves.</p>
<p>When the model of the world changes, i think it would be <em>really good</em> to involve relevant teams (including those building IDE features for customers).  If the new model needs a different user experience, then that needs to be brought up <em>early on</em> so that we can appropriate design and coordinate between the teams.</p>
<p>For example, in this case, it looks like the belief was "oh, we'll just translate this higher abstraction to a lower one that hte later clients are used to.  it will all work fine if we do that".  There wasn't enough thought given to the idea that the later clients don't just receive data, they also send it back and explicitly have features to allow users to work with that lowered data.</p>
<p>Another example of where i assume this would affect people is that Roslyn languages (like VB) allow users to remove references that are unused.  I assume this probably also breaks as we will suggest removing dlls that are part of 'packs' that probably can't be broken up.</p>
<p>So, IMO, it's not sufficient to just lower to a form that a later module needs.  If modules can be bidirectional, there needs to be thought, design and communication with teh appropriate teams to ensure that the operations in both directions make sense.</p>
