    <h1>Online ticketing company investigating &#x27;potential vulnerability&#x27; in its systems</h1>
    <div class="article section"> <p class="published"> Posted <span class="timestamp"> September 10, 2019 07:10:50 </span> </p> <p>An online ticketing company has moved quickly to fix a &quot;potential data leak&quot; after a university student claimed the personal details of thousands of people had been revealed.</p><div class="inline-content wysiwyg right">
<h2>Key points:</h2><ul><li>Get is an online ticketing website used by university clubs and societies</li><li>A student says the personal data of users on the site was publicly available </li><li>The company says it is investigating and will &quot;provide a further update when it becomes available&quot;</li></ul>
</div><p>In a statement posted on its website, Get said it had &quot;immediately acted&quot; following reports of a &quot;potential vulnerability&quot; in its systems.</p><p>&quot;If we become aware of any specific information which has been compromised we will notify the organisations, their members and report a breach,&quot; the company&apos;s statement said.</p><p>&quot;No personal payment information is stored in Get&apos;s databases and payments are processed by a secure third-party payment processor, responsible for many of the world&apos;s online transactions.&quot;</p><p>On its website, it told users it was investigating the &quot;potential data leak&quot; and would provide a further update when it became available.</p><p>The online ticketing start-up, which originated in Sydney, is used by university clubs and associations to manage memberships and sell tickets to events in four countries.</p><p>According to its website, Get has more than 159,000 students from 453 societies and clubs in its community.</p><p>University clubs listed on its website include those belonging to the University of Adelaide, UNSW Sydney, the University of Sydney, Macquarie University, the University of Technology and Griffith University.</p><p>A spokesman for Australia&apos;s national privacy regulator, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), said it was aware of reports of a potential data breach involving Get.</p><p>&quot;While we can&apos;t comment on the specifics, we would expect any organisation to act quickly to contain a data breach involving personal information and assess the potential impact on those affected,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;If it&apos;s likely to result in serious harm, and the organisation is covered by the privacy act, they must notify the people who are affected and the OAIC as quickly as possible.&quot;</p><p>In 2018-19, the OAIC received 1,160 reports of data breaches in Australia.</p><h2>Student claims &apos;insane&apos; amount of information available</h2><p>Claims about the system vulnerability emerged over the weekend, after a University of Canberra software engineering student posted on social media.</p><p>The student, who asked to remain anonymous, told the ABC he found the data when applying for a club membership.</p><p>&quot;[The website] showed a list of all the people that were part of that society, which seemed a bit strange to me,&quot; the student said.</p><p>He said a quick online search found the personal data of about 200,000 users dating back more than a year.</p><p>&quot;I looked at the information that was being sent from Get to my computer &#x2026; it&apos;s things like name, phone number, date of birth, addresses, student number.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;Having that publicly available is just insane.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>He said he had also seen searches which led him to believe hackers had tried to access the information, including SQL injection attempts, which use vulnerabilities to bypass a site&apos;s security measures.</p><p>&quot;I saw queries for last four digits, assuming of a credit card. I saw queries for names on hashed passwords,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;The [searches had been] done in a sequential pattern &#x2026; they were accessing specific [information] on the server, they were asking for specific sets of information.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t do that unless you knew what you&apos;re looking for.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>He said he reported the issue to Get and other impacted universities.</p><p>&quot;I guess my concern is that, you know, they&apos;re definitely not letting us know what details may or may not be available at the wider web. Just because you shut, it doesn&apos;t &#x2026; turn off the tap,&quot; he said.</p><h2>Vulnerability &apos;egregiously basic&apos;, expert says </h2><p>Security researcher Troy Hunt told the ABC any personal information could be used for nefarious purposes, including identity theft. </p><p>He described the claimed system vulnerability as &quot;egregiously basic&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Certainly for someone looking to perform some sort of malicious activity, the more information they can get about someone the better &#x2014; and certainly there has been quite a lot of personal information leaked by this service,&quot; he said.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>&quot;I&apos;d be concerned if this was my data. This is information that I would not want to willingly share with other people.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;By the time you match names with phone numbers and addresses and birth dates and things like that, it is a lot of personal information, and remember things like your birthdate<strong> </strong>are often used as identify verification questions.&quot;</p><h2>Tech start-up originated in Sydney</h2><p>Get&apos;s predecessor Qnect was established in 2016 by University of New South Wales commerce students Daniel Liang and Ryan Chen.</p><p>The tech start-up has since expanded to three other countries,<strong> </strong>and has sold $6.2 million worth of tickets, organisation memberships and merchandise across university campuses.</p><p>In a separate incident in May 2017, Qnect users began receiving threatening text messages from a hacking group which called itself RavenCrew.</p><p>It threatened to release private data unless it was paid a ransom in Bitcoin.</p><p>Mr Liang said at the time the threats were reported to the Australian Federal Police, and moved to reassure users no financial information was accessed as it was stored with a third party.</p> <p class="topics"> <strong>Topics:</strong> <a href="/news/topic/data-protection-policy">data-protection-policy</a>, <a href="/news/topic/internet-culture">internet-culture</a>, <a href="/news/topic/hacking">hacking</a>, <a href="/news/topic/australia">australia</a> </p> </div>
