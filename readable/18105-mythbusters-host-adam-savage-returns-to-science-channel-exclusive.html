Each episode will focus on one project as Adam collaborates with notable experts in their fields, friends, colleagues and others.</p><p>"I've spent my life trying to make, create and push the boundaries of what's possible," said Savage. "This new series is a culmination of sorts, as I get to work with some of the most brilliant minds out there as we attempt to solve really absurd ideas that I've had in my head for a long time, but have never had the opportunity to dive into, until now. And of course, the most absurd ideas are often what generate the most innovative engineering."</p><p>Episodes include Savage's attempt to create a working version of one of history's most notorious engineering failures, the British military's World War II rocket-propelled explosive weapon, The Great Panjandrum. Helping with the design is the lead engineer of the Mars Science Lab’s EDL (Entry, Descent, Landing phase), NASA engineer Adam Steltzner.</p><p>For the titanium Iron-Man inspired suit Adam enlists Richard Browning, famous for his Gravity Jet Suit, which is powered by five 1,000-horsepower mini jet engines strapped to his body.</p><p>Inventor, maker and roboticist Simone Giertz and maker Laura Kampf help Adam build three Mad Max-inspired, postapocalyptic monsters of destruction using only junk cars and the materials they can salvage from a scrapyard.</p><p>"Adam's enthusiasm for science is contagious,” said Nancy Daniels, chief brand officer at Discovery and Factual. "<em>Savage Builds</em> is the perfect showcase for him to do what he loves to do on a scale that hasn't been done before."</p><p>For 14 seasons, from 2003 to 2016, Savage co-hosted the popular series <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/science-channel-reviving-mythbusters-seeking-879292" target="_blank"><em>MythBusters</em></a> with Jamie Hyneman, in which the pair used science to put various myths and rumors to the test. The duo also co-hosted the 2012 game show <em>Unchained Reaction.</em></p><p>The series is produced by Whalerock Industries. Executive producers for Whalerock are Savage, Lloyd Braun, Chris Cowan and John Tessier. Executive producer for Science is Wyatt Channell.</p><footer class="blog-post-tags"><a href="/topic/discovery-channel" data-tracklabel="Story Well - Bottom Tags Discovery Channel">Discovery Channel</a></footer></div></div></div></div>
