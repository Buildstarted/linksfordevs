Potential hackers can use these security flaws to take over the devices and essentially track children and have conversations with them, researchers warn.&#xA0;</p><p class="speakableTextP2">Security company Rapid7 <a href="http://blog.rapid7.com/2019/12/11/iot-vuln-disclosure-childrens-gps-smart-watches-r7-2019-57/">disclosed vulnerabilities with three smartwatches</a> sold on Amazon: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NVJDW69?tag=cnet-buy-button-20">GreaSmart</a>, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NNB2LDZ?tag=cnet-buy-button-20">Jsbaby</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GDS5F7K?tag=cnet-buy-button-20">Smarturtle</a>. All three smartwatches are targeted at children and cost less than $40. They are marketed as tracking devices to keep tabs on kids and allow parents to send messages and phone calls to their children.&#xA0;</p><p>But Rapid7&apos;s security researchers discovered that it&apos;s not just parents who can get in touch with kids wearing the watch. The watches are supposed to be contacted only by approved phone numbers through a whitelist, but Rapid7 found that this filter didn&apos;t work at all. &#xA0;</p><p>The watches also accepted configuration commands through text messages, which means that a potential hacker could change settings on the watch, putting children at risk.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;You can identify where the phone or the child is, you can gain access to audio, or make phone calls to children,&quot; said Deral Heiland, Rapid7&apos;s IoT research lead. </p><p>All three watches use the same software, so vulnerabilities are spread across the board for all three, the researchers said. </p><svg class="svg-symbol playerControls"><symbol id="play"><path/></symbol><symbol id="pause"><g><polygon/><rect width="10.6" height="32"/></g></symbol><symbol id="playlist"><g><circle class="st11"/><circle class="st11"/><circle class="st11"/><path class="st11"/><path class="st11"/><path class="st11"/></g></symbol><symbol id="speaker-on"><g><g><path/></g><path/><path/></g></symbol><symbol id="speaker-off"><g><g><path/></g><polygon/></g></symbol><symbol id="captions"><g><path/><path/></g></symbol><symbol id="share"><path/></symbol><symbol id="fullscreen"><g><g><polygon class="st11"/></g><g><polygon class="st11"/></g><g><polygon class="st11"/></g><g><polygon class="st11"/></g></g></symbol><symbol id="video"><g><path/></g></symbol></svg>

    <p>These aren&apos;t the only children&apos;s connected devices that have glaring security risks. In June 2018, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-will-stop-selling-connected-toy-cloud-pets-filled-with-security-issues/">Amazon pulled CloudPets from its store</a> after researchers found vulnerabilities with its Bluetooth. In September, researchers disclosed a security vulnerability on <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/over-600000-china-made-gps-trackers-have-123456-as-default-password/">GPS trackers for children</a> that gave up the location data on at least 600,000 users.&#xA0;</p><p>Internet-of-things devices are plagued by security issues, raising <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/lawmakers-want-to-stop-a-future-filled-with-smart-devices-and-bad-security/">concern among lawmakers about how easily these products can be hacked</a>. Connected devices <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/iot-devices-need-security-standards-built-in-ul-says/">don&apos;t have any security standards</a>, leaving customers unaware of what vulnerabilities could be present on a gadget.&#xA0;</p><p>Amazon didn&apos;t respond to a request for comment on whether it would remove the three watches from its store. The watch makers couldn&apos;t be reached for comment.&#xA0;</p><p>Rapid7&apos;s researchers also found that the three smartwatches had the exact same default password: 123456. It&apos;s unlikely people would change this password, as the devices don&apos;t even tell the users that password exists or how they can change it, Rapid7 said.&#xA0;</p><p>With this simple password and the ability to change configurations through text messages, a potential hacker could take over devices and track children, even pairing the smartwatches with their own phones, researchers warned.&#xA0;</p><p>Another glaring flaw Rapid7 found was that there&apos;s no way to contact the manufacturers behind the three smartwatches sold on Amazon. Without any way to reach out to the company, Rapid7&apos;s researchers raised concerns that there would be no way to fix these vulnerabilities.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;Trying to figure out who the manufacturers are can be difficult, or impossible in some cases,&quot; Heiland said. &quot;Very often, the watches are made exactly the same and put in different boxes to be sold.&quot; </p><div class="shortcode gallery">
