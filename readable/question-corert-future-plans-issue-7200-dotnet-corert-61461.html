          <p>Dear CoreRT team,</p>
<p>Having followed this repo for now a couple of years and having developed a product depending on it, it's been quite a journey to follow the development in here. It's been very rewarding to be able to follow the progress of a compiler and runtime and I've been stoked to see that it was finally possible to do full AOT compilation of .NET. It's been a joy to watch the discussions and PRs come in one by one, slowly improving the product - thank you to the whole team for all their hard work on this!</p>
<p>Now for my question.<br>
During the past months I've started to notice hints about the future of CoreRT in a growing number of discussions around github and I've been surprised to see references to that CoreRT is still considered an experimental runtime and is often ruled out as a good solution for customers. Whereas initially over the first years following this, it felt like CoreRT was on a path to becoming part of the official "dotnet" CLI experience, but these recent discussions seem to indicate that the opposite is true. It strikes me that in the long discussion thread on single file deployment many of the use cases would benefit from CoreRT yet it seems like everybody is ruling it out for reasons I still don't fully understand (apart from the obvious dynamic plugin loading, but honestly there are many alternative ways to implement plugins in CoreRT, some of which we use in our product).</p>
<p>It seems to me that you have a stellar product here that would solve so many issues if it were on a path to official support, yet at some point along the way it was decided to not fully support it anyway. <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/jkotas/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/jkotas">@jkotas</a> you hinted in the discussion that the technology would likely end up in a (different) product some day, but even if that calmed my nerves slightly, it also sparked more questions, such as - can we continue to rely on this compiler for our product, or do we run the risk of it suddenly falling out of grace.<br>
I thought at one point that the decision to not officially support CoreRT was simply that it wasn't ready. But now that it feels increasingly more mature yet seems to be ruled out of official support plans, it strikes me that it might be a more strategic decision.</p>
<p>I know that this might be a tricky question to answer in a public forum, but please don't take it the wrong way. I'm just curious to try to understand if full AOT compilation (not CPAOT but CoreRT) is still being considered a strategic part of the .NET future.</p>
<p>I have noticed the efforts to unify the sources from the various runtimes which is another hint that long time development is intended. I understand that this repo serves many officially supported products, among those now .NET Native and CPAOT, which leads me to have greater trust in CoreRT going forward.</p>
<p>But I hope it makes sense that it would be nice at one point to gain a little clarity of what Microsoft's intentions are in the longer term in this space. In my ideal world, it would be decided to acknowledge how great of a product this already is and it would gain a permanent place on the .NET stage.</p>

          <p>Hello Christian,</p>
<p>I am sorry, but there is not much new at this point beyond what I have said in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/20287#issuecomment-447122236">https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/20287#issuecomment-447122236</a> .</p>
<p>We definitely do want to have a great full AOT compilation story as one of the officially supported deployment options for .NET Core eventually. It is not happening for .NET Core 3. We have not really started planning for .NET Core 4.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have noticed the efforts to unify the sources from the various runtimes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, we have been working hard for a while (2+ years actually) to share and unify between all actively developed .NET Runtimes (CoreCLR, Mono and .NET Native/CoreRT). It reduces our engineering costs and in turn gives us more freedom with shipping runtimes optimized for different scenarios.</p>

          <p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your answer, I really appreciate it.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm very happy to hear this. My concern was less about timing than about long term commitment and knowing that this is still being actively considered.<br>
It's great to hear that I was reading the efforts around unifying the runtimes correctly and that it will make supporting CoreRT easier in the future.</p>
<p>I do think that once you can say with confidence "Now we support full AOT in .NET", you will start attracting a league of programmers that would otherwise not consider .NET.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>

          <p>I think there is a missed opportunity to create a whole new flavor of c# and .net dedicated to native, like jetbrains is doing with kotlin jvm -&gt; kotlin native</p>
<p>If the .net team don't want to integrate corert, and instead want to provide single-executable distribution, by zipping/unzipping 70mb or runtime at RUNTIME then let them follow Java path and die, because GO is already eating them slowly</p>
<p>Because seriously when i look at this today, i start to wonder if i should keep with C# or go native directly, like seriously.... 230 files...</p>

<p>CoreRT is the way to go, even if slow compilation is annoying, microsoft is making yet another mistake by not focusing on it</p>

          <p>The quality of development in this repo is highly impressive, and the response to user issues also.</p>
<p>The repo does suffer from a lack of planning and documentation. A particularly bad example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The current state of platform support: Windows, MacOS and Linux x64 w/ RyuJIT codegen: Simple apps</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might as well say "mostly harmless". The real story is good support for complex apps, with the exception of fiddly reflection, and lack of support for most .Net UI frameworks.</p>
<p>My advice for this repo is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things that are easy, not technically interesting, but highly important to users are often not being done at the moment. Updates on progress on the main page is one. The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/5001" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/corert/issues/5001/hovercard">state of rd.xml</a> also comes to mind.</li>
<li>Position the repo to target major use cases. They are coming up all the time now but the reponse is always to ignore CoreRT and use some other method. You can't do all of these straight away but the difference between supporting one of these on none of them is life or death for CoreRT.
<ul>
<li>WPF. If CoreRT can be used for WPF apps that would get a lot of usage.</li>
<li>Xamarin. Mono has a lot of compatibility and extends the reach of .Net (into Xamarin.IOS, Xamarin.Android). It would be much better for users if Xamarin and wasm/blazor could use CoreRT instead of Mono AOT.</li>
<li>Asp.net core. "Simple apps". This needs to be upgraded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree. While this might be subjective, requiring the user to have interpreters/VMs or shipping them with your products in my opinion feels too low-quality, and while there are ways to provide a seamless experience, decent native binaries would be ideal. The ones CoreRT produce are in my opinion quite good.</p>
<p>CoreRT has been serving me well so far, but I'm a bit disappointed after reading the replies here. It's initiatives like this that make .NET appealing outside the web/LOB bubble, but I was hoping it would have more focus. For realtime software GC is also a substantial problem.</p>
<p><a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/RUSshy/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/RUSshy">@RUSshy</a> I don't think the comparison with Go is fair. C# is a much better language and it's still appropriate for our indie games. The new features in C# 7.3 and 8 really helped with optimization and if you go with a DoD approach the GC will probably not be a huge problem. However, I'm starting to think that maybe Jai will happen before CoreRT goes official.</p>

          <p>I just realized this discussion is mostly about building a single binary. I personally don't care about that to be honest. While it would certainly be nice to be able to produce small single native binaries for simple CLI tools, in my opinion what CoreRT currently outputs is already acceptable although certainly not perfect.</p>
<p>What is a bit discouraging about all of this is that it seems there's still too much focus on the web. I think .NET is already a very established and competitive technology there, and I'm not sure whether investing so much on it would change that dramatically, although maybe that's where the financial returns are, I don't know. The vast majority of the C# developers and jobs seem to be related to that (ASP.NET and such).</p>
<p>I would like to see a more diverse user base. For realtime applications for example, besides some XNA diehards (MG/FNA/UV) and Unity there's not much going on<code>*</code>. I suspect that with a fraction of the effort being spent on the web stuff .NET could become substantially more attractive to people doing realtime applications like game/simulations/etc. The new lower-level language features introduced since C# 7 helped a lot, but overall there's still a 'server-grade tech' feel to .NET, what could be remedied with AOT and for realtime applications a more suitable GC too. (I'm talking about objective stuff like requiring runtime environments and JIT/GC pauses)</p>
<p>I'm a game developer and it's widely known that the vast majority of us aren't happy with any language we have so far. I'm pretty sure that's very evident if you have contact with other game developers on social media. <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/RUSshy/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/RUSshy">@RUSshy</a> knows that very well. I personally picked C# because I like the language a lot and things like the "local GC" and CoreRT gave me hope for the future, but I can't really blame my fellow developers who frown upon .NET.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just think that if MS could focus just a little bit more on those issues I mentioned, I'm pretty sure there's a lot of users who would be happy to switch to .NET. It's obvious .NET isn't popular for realtime application development (as it could be), and diversifying the user base is a good thing! However, judging by what happened to XNA it seems that's not a concern, and that makes me a bit wary about the future.</p>
<p>As I said though, CoreRT has been serving me well and I'm planning to continue using it. This is a fantastic project and I'm happy to hear it's not 'dying' as that tweet suggests. I would like to see more focus on the features that matter to me and I feel very underrepresented in the .NET scene. But then again, as I said the money is probably elsewhere (web/LOB) so I can't really complain.</p>
<p><code>*</code> there are incredible projects like <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/mellinoe/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/mellinoe">@mellinoe</a>'s repos, I don't want to be unfair here, but overall it's clear that there was a huge decline since XNA was discontinued.</p>

<p>CoreRT is the way to go, even if slow compilation is annoying, microsoft is making yet another mistake by not focusing on it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn't agree more.</p>
<p>Any discussion on this subject ought to begin by acknowledging a few principles that ought to be obvious but are rarely explicitly mentioned out loud:</p>
<ul>
<li>JIT compilation shortens the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/01/27/daily-builds-are-your-friend/" rel="nofollow">Edit-Compile-Test loop</a>, making it good for developer productivity.</li>
<li>JIT compilation it adds a measurable amount to the startup time and imposes a certain runtime overhead.  To provide a good experience at getting the software up and running quickly, it necessarily focuses on speed as the highest priority.</li>
<li>Code optimization frequently takes a non-trivial amount of CPU work (ie. time) to accomplish.  Therefore, high levels of optimization are anathema to a JIT.</li>
<li>Release builds are built much less frequently than development builds, and <em>run</em> much more frequently.  (Each given dev build might be run by the developer a few dozen times at most before he makes some change and rebuilds, but a release is sent out to many people and run hundreds or thousands of times.)</li>
<li>Performance matters far more for a release than for a dev build.  Low startup times and high optimization are important.</li>
<li>Therefore, a JIT is useful for developers, but <em>the exact opposite of what you want</em> when deploying software.</li>
</ul>
<p>CoreRT should be a standard piece of every .NET Core developer's toolbox.  It should be the thing you build your releases against, and it should get a nice, powerful, slow-but-worth-it optimizing compiler instead of the crappy-by-design RyuJIT which is forced to be bad at optimization because it's a JIT.</p>
<p>And while we're on the subject, it should also have RyuJIT or similar as part of the runtime.  Pretty much all of these problems we see of things that don't run right on CoreRT because it's AOT and doesn't have a JIT would go away if we just shifted the paradigm a little and instead it was AOT <em>and also has a JIT for when that's necessary.</em>  (And if that means poor support for a certain platform designed by a bunch of iDiots and control freaks who can't bear to let the unwashed masses bring a JIT into their pwecious walled garden, then so be it.  They've been losing market share for years anyway; why should we care about supporting them when they're actively hostile to our way of doing things?)</p>

<p>At that point, aren't you basically talking about crossgen? Currently it doesn't have good tooling and I believe it also uses RyuJIT, but I think those caveats still leave it in a better place than your suggestion of CoreRT AOT + JIT.</p>

<p>Yep, there are many options in the spectrum of AOT/single-file solutions. Today, part of the spectrum is covered by CoreCLR tech, part is covered by CoreRT tech, part is covered by Mono tech, and there are many gaps.

Maybe Microsoft didn't have the expected outcome from XNA and that's why they dropped it and <em>learned their lesson</em>, that they should try competing on the web instead.</p>
<p>As I said on Gitter: don't wait for them, if C#/.NET isn't suitable for you, then by all means go for another tech. Rust seems to be getting some traction for games these days, many C++ devs are either switching or evaluating it (and most seem to like it). As you said though, C# is much better in terms of iteration times and these days C# is very different from what it was when XNA was around, the latest 'low level' features allow you to code on a whole different level, and XNA was never very performant to begin with.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a language that's more future-proof I'd totally go with Rust, not only the ownership model is probably going to be the new "standard" (so even if Rust itself doesn't quite make it, you'll at least be familiar with the memory management), but as you said concurrency is much better because it was made with that in mind too. Jai won't have those features, but it might very well be an alternative for C# because the appeal is basically the same: faster iteration in a nice but familiar language, but it's not fundamentally modern.</p>
<p>Microsoft's goal is to make money, that might or might not be aligned with your goals and expectations, I'm recently coming to the conclusion that their direction is diverging too much from my expectations. C# 7.3 is already a pretty decent language, nullables would be nice but most of the new features in C# 8 people are talking about are completely passable like <code>??=</code>, interface implementations, and <code>is not</code>. They are adding those features to the language and improving web/servers stuff while AOT is being overlooked, so their priorities are completely different than mine. <strong>Imho .NET is good enough as it is, I just need to ship higher quality products using it.</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that you're talking about separate teams. So saying something like "if we didn't have default interface methods, we could have had records" does make sense, "if we didn't have DIM, we could have had AOT" makes much less sense. (Of course MS can decide to move resources between teams, but that tends to be a slow process, because it usually involves recruitment and training.)</p>
<p>Also, <code>??=</code> and <code>is not</code> are fairly small features, the resources spent on them likely wouldn't have moved AOT by much.</p>

<p>However, since it really seems to be getting some traction in the gamedev scene, I recently started giving Rust a real chance. No high expectations, I'm just trying to get used to it in order to have it as an option in my toolbox because it <em>might</em> be useful someday. So I'm slowly but surely wrapping my head around its "arcane" ownership model, and while I still can't say whether It'll ever feel natural and be productive, I guarantee you that you can achieve <em>anything</em> with it, the problem is you have to basically forget all the architectures/patterns you've used in the past. Also, even if you reach a point where you can't somehow shoehorn your code in, you can always use smart pointers and go unsafe.</p>
<p>That being said, it's possible I'll give up once again, maybe my resilience is just because in small daily doses the pain inflicted by Rust is tolerable, but once I really start using it for anything serious I'll conclude it's simply not worth the mental overhead. But again, it's certainly not going to be because it was impossible to do something in Rust. It might be impossible to directly port C++ code to Rust, but you can achieve anything with it, you just have to approach everything very differently from the get go. If you have any links about that issue please let me know. The ownership model is basically the same since the early days afaik.</p>

<p>Historically mono, while an impressive cross-platform effort, was much slower and buggier than .Net framework, from all the reviews and benchmarks I have seen. I don't know how much this has changed over the last couple of years, but I suspect that it is responsible for a lot of reported Xamarin slowness.</p>
<p>While there is a strategy to bring mono closer to .Net Core, and a lot of code is being copied over, they are doing this in a selective way without breaking changes, and they are adding features at the same time. Too half-hearted in my view. The .Net Framework has been decisively depreciated and WPF moved to .Net Core. I think Xamarin should bite the bullet and do the same.</p>

<p>That's actually good question. The answer is likely yes. Depending on implementation that may or may not be an issue.</p>
<p>It's possible for each of these GCs to operate independently. The key to doing that is the fact that every loaded runtime has to track which threads are currently running managed code (from the point of view of that one runtime). The GC would scan only stacks of the threads that are actively running managed code and its own managed heap. It should work as long as the GC is conservatively tuned to not over-allocate the reserved area for the heap. Additionally, the stack scanning and other parts of CoreRT/CoreCLR GC are precise. At every point where a GC can occur the runtime knows which part of the stack and/or registers can point to managed objects. Unlike totally conservative garbage collectors (such as Boehm) this type of GC has the potential to co-exist with other GCs within the same process quite fine.</p>

<p>I remember the issue Stack Overflow saw when they started using .NET Core, when resource limits were scaled according to the number of cores and took a long time to garbage collect at all, and that took some tweaking to adjust. I'm guessing there will be similar issues to smoke out if someone decides to run 20 add-ins, especially if they want to use the Server GC (which Stack Overflow were doing), which essentially makes some decisions (or at least used to) under the assumption that it's better to grab a lot of resources up front so you don't have to go scavenge around for them in the middle of doing stuff.</p>

<p>It would likely be possible to construct the native library support in a way that the garbage collector and GC heap could be shared. In CoreRT, the "runtime part" of the runtime is actually pretty tiny - it's pretty much just <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corert/tree/master/src/Native/Runtime">src/Native/Runtime</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corert/tree/master/src/Native/gc">src\Native\gc</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corert/tree/master/src/Runtime.Base">src\Runtime.Base</a>. If we started versioning the data structures that this minimal runtime operates on, it would be straightforward to add code to the initialization path of the native libraries that asks "is there already a minimal runtime in this process that I can use?". If the answer is yes, the native library would skip initializing its own private version of the runtime/GC and register with the running instance instead.</p>
<p>The managed code in the native library would then coexist pretty much the same way how AppDomains coexist (they would each still have their own definition of System.Object, and not see each other's managed state, but they would share things like the GC heap and the finalizer queue).</p>
<p>It's an interesting discussion that should probably be moved into a separate issue :).</p>

          <p>I have been a big fan of CoreRT. That said, I understand this is a niche for the users of .NET Core in general.</p>
<p>The question is more whether a CoreRT like runtime will be maintained by Microsoft or by open source community. I think this is a real unaddressed need of having small utilities (say less than 10MB) where some corner can be cut (for example: No need of GC runtime, if the tool is performing a simple action and close immediately).</p>
<p>To be clear, this type of runtime will require huge support if developed by Microsoft, as noobs will jump into all kind of corner cases. I am quite sure it will start appearing in the open source circle though.</p>
<p>What it means though is that .NET community will be fragmented again. Now the goal has been to bring Mono, .NET Framework and Core under a single umbrella. This may work, but Microsoft need to be aware that new runtime will be developed by the community to satisfy those niche requirements, and this goes against this goal of bringing all runtimes together.</p>

          <p>If you consider the needs of IoT and the size of that market, there is huge need for AOT now and going forward, and in that light, this is a real failure for Microsoft, failure for write once, run anywhere. Forced to use Go and rewrite much code. This is due to both final binary size and inability to compile to required architectures in .NET.</p>

<p>I wouldn't confuse complexity and current limitations for potential demand. This thread lays out a number of mainstream scenarios. CoreRT represents a hygiene style concern, you don't really care about it until you do.</p>
<p>You don't care about fast startups until you see customer satisfaction drop because of it, or requests fail due to it. You don't care about being able to make a native plugin until somebody wants to embed your application features in Office or something similar.</p>
<p>When you hit a wall like that are you going to pitch for something like CoreRT? Maybe, but that requires a fair amount of understanding about the problem domain to articulate. More likely you either shrug your shoulders and accept it or go find another stack.</p>

<p>On our end, we're still hesitant to use it on ScourgeBringer, mostly because it's not an official product and don't want to ship something that may get deprecated during the game's active support (other than that, our tests are very encouraging and show way smoother framerate and faster bootup time than .NET Core 3).</p>

<p>I believe in package management in general and I wouldn't want to lose it from CoreRT. However, I agree, Nuget could be better.</p>
<p>There are some local proxy solutions and perhaps using <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/blob/master/README.md">Paket</a> would be a better fit. It is a Nuget compatible CLI that was designed to address some of the concerns you raise. Specifically it can load Nuget dependencies from a Git repo and has tighter dependency management.</p>
<p>I haven't used it with CoreRT, but I can't think of any reason it wouldn't work.</p>

          <p>Why do we need CoreRT?</p>
<h2><strong>The key is to use the scene!</strong></h2>
<p>I believe that <strong>embedded App</strong> and <strong>desktop App</strong> and <strong>mobile App</strong> are the best use cases!<br>
The goal of CoreRT is not web applications or server-side programs or WebAssembly, because these scenarios are not sensitive to size, and the benefits of CoreRT are not very important.<br>
The purpose of CoreRT should be to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace the native C++ application on the Windows(MacOS optional) platform.</li>
<li>Replace the Object-C/Swift/Java/C ++ App on the mobile device.</li>
<li>Replace C/C ++ App  in the embedded device.</li>
</ol>
<p>A significant use is in the gaming industry and the software industry, because these areas involve the  distribution of a large number of users (<strong>small in size for easy transmission and dissemination</strong> and <strong>binary security (Anti-decompilation)</strong>).</p>
<p>don't waste time on linux/server side-program/WebAssembly.</p>
<h2>The key point of the problem is:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Distribution (Binary Size)<br>
2. User Experience (Startup Speed)<br>
3. Binary Security (Anti-Decompilation)</strong></p>
<p>Four important things for CoreRT:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reflection [optional]</strong> , if selected then the user must bear the increase in size. If not selected then reflection is not available.</li>
<li><strong>GC [optional]</strong> , if selected then the user must bear the increase in size. If it is not selected, can the library switch to rust's memory management mode (if possible?).</li>
<li>Three <strong>JIT-Mode: [Full/Half/None]</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Native compile  [required]</strong> and interact with C / C ++. Support C / C ++ and C # interoperability, automatic processing of header files, etc. (generate C # translation (wapper, binding)), use or generate native static libraries, native dynamic libraries, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know why .net is doing interoperability with Java, Objective-C and Swift, which is a waste of time.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In the microservices area, in fact, the startup speed of .net core with Jit &amp; GC is already fast enough. Only further optimization is required.</p>
<p>Webassembly is too restrictive, and I don't think it should be CoreRT's task and goal.<br>
I think Webassembly may need technology like ilmarge to Reduce Webassembly transmission size. Not AOT/Native.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Because CoreRT's resources are very limited, I think the CoreRT team should start and prioritize the most important points.<br>
Of course Webassembly is also important, but currently limited by the support of the platform and browser and the proportion of the technology used (popularity), it does not seem to be worth the precious time of the CoreRT team.</p>
<p>If possible, the work related to WebAssembly is handed over to the Blazor team.</p>

          <p>WebAssembly, especially in light of the upcoming <a href="https://wasi.dev/" rel="nofollow">WASI system interface</a> and <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/08/webassembly-interface-types/" rel="nofollow">Interface Types</a> would be a great technology for hosting sandboxed and granularly restricted plugins or libraries written in any language. (It's already extremely attractive for this purpose even when cobbling together an interface requires rough hacks and handwaving.)</p>
<p>I don't know how much CoreRT is involved in making .NET a good platform for using them, but I see a lot of people dismissing WebAssembly just because they don't do/like "browser stuff" and to me it seems akin to saying, in the "DHTML" days, that HTML and JavaScript will only ever produce cheeky little analog clocks that follow the mouse cursor. There's tons of potential, and unlike the HTML/JavaScript example, WebAssembly is designed to be a compiler binary target and basically equal native efficiency. The only "Web" part of "WebAssembly" is that it has a good interface to be used from within a browser and was initially deployed there, but it's interesting even if you never touch any browser stuff ever.</p>

          <p>As I've said before, it's incredibly tone-deaf to talk about obfuscation as a positive feature when it's very much an anti-feature these days.  With the wide proliferation of malware online, people are starting to take more and more note of the concept and to understand that <em>obfuscation means you have something to hide.</em>  It's becoming associated in the popular consciousness with guilt, because it's such a widely-employed malware technique, and we need to stop talking about it like it's good or desirable in any way.</p>
<p>The easy decompilability of IL is one of our ecosystem's greatest advantages, because it keeps .NET developers honest.  When our code can be audited at any time by anyone with a modicum of technical skill and the proper tools, it becomes fairly easy to verify that our code is not malicious.  (And also to check it for bugs, to interoperate with it and work out tricky technical details, etc.)  The value in trustworthiness and positive reputation that this confers outweighs any so-called "code security" benefits obtained through obfuscation by orders of magnitude, especially since, as <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/mrhelmut/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/mrhelmut">@mrhelmut</a> points out, obfuscation only provides a false sense of security through obscurity anyway.</p>
<p>If the code is capable of being read and understood by a computer, it's capable of being read and understood by a reverse engineer following the same processes the computer would.  Period.  End of discussion.  When even Microsoft, who spends more money on R&amp;D in a week than you will see in your entire life, can't prevent reverse engineers from cracking new releases of major products within days if not sooner, what possible reason could you have for thinking you can?  "Binary security" is a myth, and the sooner we give up on the concept entirely, the better off we'll all be.</p>

AOT compilation has its own specific advantages and use cases.</p>
<p>I think it's important not to infer from your comments that the less human-readable/reverse-engineerable aspect of AOT code is, categorically, a negative. It just need not be presented as a positive.</p>
