<p>If you’re reading this post, you might be interested in trying your hand at
live coding on stream, as a way of sharing your projects in a more relatable,
immediate way than a polished blog post, teaching others about programming, or
just as a way to have fun. I think that live coding and streams in general are
an interesting possible future form of both education and entertainment, and if
you’re contemplating starting your own stream, I sincerely hope that you do it.</p>
<p>This month marks the 6 month anniversary of the first stream on <a href="https://twitch.tv/large__data__bank">LARGE DATA
BANK</a>, my Twitch live coding channel. It’s
grown from a one-off Friday experiment into a regularly scheduled part of my
life, a community of dozens of wonderful regular viewers and chatters, and
an activity that’s one of the top things I look forward to doing every week.</p>
<p>I’ve learned a lot along the way, and this detailed guide to the way I’ve
set up my stream is my attempt at stepping back and sharing those learnings in
the hopes of inspiring others to try this awesome hobby for themselves. I hope
it’s useful for you as you start your own journey into streaming.</p>
<p>If you have any questions that aren’t answered in this blog post, I’m more than
happy to answer them <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanALewis">on Twitter</a> or
<a href="https://jordanlewis.org/">elsewhere online</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever your reasons for wanting to try streaming, there’s quite a bit of setup
that you’ll need to do up front to try it out that can feel daunting. Everyone
has to go through this initial setup period, though, and so can you. You got
this!</p>
<p>The most important part of this post is the
<a href="#obs-configuration">section</a> about
<a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a>, which is the awesome, cross-platform, free and
open source streaming software that most of the community uses. OBS will be
your best friend on your streaming journey! You will use it to control your
webcam, desktop, audio, and every other element that goes into the final
product of your livestream.</p>
<p>The rest of the post focuses on configuration that’s more specific to Twitch.
I like to use Twitch because I like the culture that’s developed there over
time, but plenty of people think that YouTube Live is more appropriate for
professional content. I’m not too familiar with YouTube Live, but most of the
discussion about OBS should apply the same for YouTube as it does for Twitch:
the main difference is that you’ll configure OBS to send to your YouTube
account instead of Twitch in Stream settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Yo!</em> If you’re trying to set up your very first stream</strong>, you really
don’t need most of the stuff in this guide, which represents what I’ve built
gradually over the past 6 months, stream by stream. My recommendation for the
livecoding-curious is to try streaming with a bare-bones setup, to see how
you like it, before investing in expensive gear or diving into hours of
configuration and asset creation. You can accomplish this in several hours
over a weekend. Set up a single scene in OBS with your captured desktop as
the background and your webcam in the corner, with your microphone configured
under Mic/Aux. That’s all you need: a simple setup for streaming your coding
is now yours! I’ll cover how to make that happen below, in the OBS
Configuration section. Just ignore most of the extra scenes and various bells
and whistles, and you’ll be good to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> is where you’ll produce everything that your
viewers can see and hear on the live video, including your desktop, the camera
with your beautiful face on it, your voice, and any stream alerts, overlays,
text, or other information that you might want to show to your viewers.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/desktop2.png" alt="Desktop"></p>
<p>There’s a lot to cover with OBS and I’m not going to try to explain all of it,
so I’ll just talk about what’s worked for me. To make something that suits you,
you’ll need to flex your creative muscles! You can use the ideas here as a
starting place, but you’ll need to dive into OBS and play around: everyone’s
setup is going to be different.</p>
<h2 id="scenes">Scenes <a href="#scenes" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h2>
<p>A <em>scene</em> is OBS’s name for a particular layout of video and audio components
on a stream. Typically, you’ll see Twitch streamers stay on a single scene for
most of their stream: their game, desktop, or whatever their focus is. But it’s
handy to have a few extra ones for the intro and outro to your stream,
something that covers the screen for when you want to take a break, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/scenes.png" alt="Scenes popped out"></p>
<p>I have the main scenes that I use bound to global hotkeys, so I can switch
between them without having to click around in OBS. Unfortunately, sometimes
the hotkeys stop working during the stream - I’ve yet to figure out exactly why
this happens. If you happen to have this same problem and have found a
workaround, please let me know!</p>
<p>I have 6 primary scenes, and a couple of child scenes that are embedded in
several main scenes to deduplicate on-screen elements (the ones below the
<code>-----</code> in the picture). However, I spend the vast majority of my stream on one
of them: the Desktop scene.</p>
<h3 id="desktop">Desktop <a href="#desktop" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h3>
<p>This scene is the workhorse of the stream, and the one that’s active 95% of the
time. It consists of a full-screen, 1080p Display Capture source of my external
monitor. This is convenient because it leaves no ambiguity about what’s catpured
on the stream (it’s the whole monitor) and leaves my laptop screen free for
the OBS window, monitoring chat, and anything else that I want to look at while
streaming without having to show my viewers.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://jordanlewis.org/posts/desk-setup-2020">Desktop setup post</a> goes into more detail about the
way that I’ve set up my desk to have two monitors. It’s so convenient for the
stream that I’m hooked, and I’m not sure how I’d manage without.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/desktopscene.png" alt="Desktop Scene in OBS"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quick note on font size: you have to make your text editor font quite large
to make it legible for your viewers! It will take a little while to get used
to this. I use 26-point font in my editor, which provides only about 30
visible horizontal lines of code. This is next to nothing compared to the
amount of context you’re probably used to seeing while programming. This
hamstringing is worth it, though: the bigger your font, the more likely it is
that your viewers will be able to follow along with what you’re doing, stay
engaged, ask questions, learn, and have fun.</p>
<p>You should also try to remove as many distracting elements from your editor
and desktop as possible while streaming, to keep the focus on the code. For
me, this has meant disabling the Mac’s menubar and Dock, and removing the
vast majority of toolbars from my IDE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the desktop capture source, which is at the back of the scene, I’ve
added several other sources:</p>
<ol>
<li>Face cam, which is a video source from my capture card (more information about the video sources in the <a href="#video">Video</a> section)</li>
<li>Keyboard cam, which is a video source from a webcam pointed at my keyboard.</li>
<li>A couple of text boxes, to show my most recent subscriber, follower, and
some on-stream commands. The text boxes are updated automatically by the
<a href="https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/streamlabels">StreamLabels</a> app.</li>
<li>A web page source connected to Streamlabs Stream Alerts, which I’ll cover <a href="#stream-alerts">below</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I definitely didn’t start with all of these elements - it’s quite a lot of work
to tweak things just the way you want - but I’ve kept this configuration for the
past couple of months and I like the way it looks.</p>
<h3 id="whiteboard">Whiteboard <a href="#whiteboard" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h3>
<p>The whiteboard scene is meant to showcase my iPad full screen, allowing me to
draw things on stream to demonstrate ideas or concepts. I use the Concepts app
on the iPad along with an Apple Pencil for drawing, and it works pretty nicely.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/whiteboard.png" alt="Whiteboard scene"></p>
<p>I didn’t know how to fill up the space on the bottom left, since the iPad
doesn’t have a widescreen aspect ratio like my monitor does, so I put a picture
that my friend Aileen drew of me to make the stream a bit more visually
interesting!</p>
<p>This scene references the same facecam and alerts source as the Desktop scene.
You can definitely use DRY principles in OBS, just like software - but it does
get tricky to keep everything de-duplicated.</p>
<h3 id="ipad-green-screen-overlay">iPad Green Screen Overlay <a href="#ipad-green-screen-overlay" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h3>
<p>I also set up a “green screen” configuration for the iPad that I can overlay
over any other scene with a global hotkey. This gives me the ESPN football
announcer effect during my stream: I can draw on my iPad, and the lines will
appear overlayed on top of whatever else I have on stream at the time.</p>
<p>This is probably the most complex video element on my
stream, but OBS makes it pretty simple to set up. I added a Color Key filter
with a black background on top of the raw iPad video feed, set my drawing app
to have a black background, and tweaked the Color Key settings in OBS until
things looked right:</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/colorkey.png" alt="iPad Color Key"></p>
<p>I don’t use this element as nearly as often as I’d like, but I think it’s
pretty neat. I recorded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4WJQmN1cSo">demo
video</a> of it if you’re curious for
how it looks - I also use it occasionally on the stream.</p>
<h3 id="selfie">Selfie <a href="#selfie" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h3>
<p>This is just a full-screen version of the facecam. I copied the name of the
scene from <a href="https://medium.com/@suzhinton/my-twitch-live-coding-setup-b2516672fb21">@noopkat’s
blog</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/selfie.png" alt="Selfie scene"></p>
<p>I use this scene for “turn to the camera” moments, which I find really fun. I’ll
switch to the scene, look right at the camera, and talk for a bit before
switching back to the desktop view.</p>
<h3 id="starting-soon">Starting Soon <a href="#starting-soon" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h3>
<p>This scene goes on as soon as the stream turns on, until I’m ready to start
talking to the camera. I’ll usually start the stream a few minutes before the
time that I announced on Twitter for my stream, and leave it up until that time
comes (with a muted mic!).</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/startingsoon.png" alt="Starting Soon scene"></p>
<p>I used a gif I found on the internet of someone typing, so people can tell that
the stream is live even though there’s nothing happening yet. There’s also music
during this “pre-roll”. I’ll talk about music and sound <a href="#audio">later</a>).</p>
<h3 id="brb">BRB <a href="#brb" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h3>
<p>I’ll put this scene on if I need to step away from the stream for a moment to
use the bathroom or whatever. I added a sound to it as well, which I think is
kind of funny - when I switch to the scene, it’ll play the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uleM9ZNTE34">“be right
back”</a> sound - I’m not sure where
this sound is from but I think it’s a meme :)</p>
<p>This scene also has a gif so that people know the stream is still alive.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/brb.png" alt="BRB scene"></p>
<h3 id="bye">Bye <a href="#bye" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h3>
<p>Ending your stream is straightforward: you click the Stop Streaming button in
OBS. Rather than cutting directly from Desktop to the stream being over, it’s
nice to switch the video to a goodbye scene, so people know that you’re about
to stop the broadcast.</p>
<p>For this, I drew a little goodbye picture on my iPad. I try to remember to put
this on before I end the stream, but it’s easy to forget: there’s a lot to try
to pack in right at the end! I try to talk right at the camera, thank people
for stopping by, and recap the stream, but I also typically try to find a
streamer to raid at the same time (Twitch’s term for sending your viewers to
another stream when you’re ready to stop), which adds a bunch of extra mental
overhead. All of this adds up to sometimes forgetting to toggle the “Bye”
scene.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/bye.png" alt="Bye scene"></p>
<h2 id="video">Video <a href="#video" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h2>
<p>There’s a bunch of settings you’ll need to tweak in OBS, but probably the
most important ones will be your Video and Output settings.</p>
<p>The Video settings control the Canvas and Output resolutions (the size of the
stream canvas on your computer, and the resolution that OBS will send to
Twitch). The bigger the output resolution, the more bandwidth you’ll need to
stream, and the more bandwidth your viewers will need to watch. The most popular
streamers get “quality options” from Twitch, which allows viewers to watch at
a lower quality, but most streamers don’t get options - the viewers have to
watch at the same resolution that the streamer streams at. And, if your canvas
resolution differs from your output resolution, OBS will need to apply a
downscaling filter, adding to the CPU load.</p>
<p>All of this to say, I set both resolutions to 720p! It seems like a good mix of
bandwidth and quality to me.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/videosettings.png" alt="Video settings"></p>
<p>The Output settings control the behavior of the encoder, and must be tuned to
provide the right mix of quality and CPU use. Generally, the higher the
bitrate, the better your stream will look, but the more network bandwidth and
CPU OBS will consume. You’ll want to find a mix that works for you. Here’s what
I use, but of course, YMMV and you should experiment:</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/outputsettings.png" alt="Output settings"></p>
<p>The best way to test this stuff is to record sample videos and examine them, as
well as to use the <a href="https://inspector.twitch.tv/">Twitch Inspector</a>, which
gives you a modified <a href="#streaming-to-twitch-finally">Stream Key</a>
that you can configure OBS with. Once you start streaming with the modified
key, you’ll be able to monitor your upload bandwidth and the bitrate that you
can sustainably send to Twitch via the Inspector website, without having to
actually go live.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/inspector.png" alt="Twitch Inspector"></p>
<p>This graph is from a recent stream that I had to cut off due to internet issues,
which I think were caused by the intense storm that was rolling through Brooklyn
at that time. You can see there are several instabilities in the graph, and some
“unstable” events. A good, stable stream will have zero or few blips in the
graph.</p>
<p>One slight annoyance with the Inspector is that it only gives you your bitrate
and bandwidth, in a graph: it doesn’t actually let you play the stream back
to make sure it looks good. If you’re just getting started and really want to
test out the pipeline end to end, you can set up a private or unlisted YouTube
Live broadcast and stream to that. That will let you see your video during or
after your test stream.</p>

<p>I use a <a href="https://amzn.to/3294YlO">Sony a6400</a> camera with a <a href="https://amzn.to/3iYb4LG">Sigma 30mm
f/1.4</a> lens to capture my visage. You <em>definitely</em>
don’t need such a high quality camera to get started streaming with, but if
you’ve got one, you might as well use it! The quality will be immediately
noticeable.</p>
<p>Whatever camera you use, you’ll probably want to make sure you have some nice
light shining on your beautiful face! The easiest way to do this is to stream
during the day: sunlight makes everyone look good. If you’re streaming at night,
you’ll need to figure out lighting in a different way. I talk about the cheapo
DIY softbox I use in my <a href="https://jordanlewis.org/posts/desk-setup-2020/#lighting">desk setup post</a>.</p>

<p>Side note: if you’re not using a USB webcam or the camera on your laptop,
you’ll need a capture card to convert your camera’s HDMI output into a video
stream for OBS to use. I use the <a href="https://amzn.to/2ATcRAx">AVerMedia Live Gamer Portable 2
Plus</a>, which while hideous and rather large, does
the trick. It also has pass through HDMI, which gives me the option of
capturing a game console if I ever decide to stream something that isn’t
programming.</p>
<p>One thing to note about the capture card is that it does introduce some latency
between what the camera sees and the output stream in OBS. To compensate for
this, I added artificial latency to my microphone to match the capture card’s
latency. I’ll talk about this later, in the
<a href="#audio">audio section</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started out with the <a href="https://amzn.to/2OiKteb">Logitech C922</a>, which is a
fabulous, affordable webcam. After I upgraded to the fancier Sony, I figured
I’d put the Logitech to good use by pointing it at my handsome keyboard and
letting viewers see the soothing, soothing ASMR effect of my hands tapping
keys during my stream.</p>
<p>I like this, but it adds a little bit of extra mental load to make sure that I
remember to not type passwords! I’ve leaked some unimportant passwords a couple
of times this way (though not sure if anyone has taken the time to try to
figure them out from the video), so hopefully at this point I’ve learned my
lesson.</p>

<p>Sound is the other really important component of a stream, besides the video.
Your viewers want to hear your silky smooth voice, and depending on what you’re
trying to do on stream, might also want to hear the sound from whatever you’re
doing on your computer. I also like to include a low volume of background music
on my stream, to ease the transition to silence if I have to take some moments
to think about what I’m doing. It’s also a common touch to add a sound to your
<a href="#stream-alerts">stream alerts</a>.</p>
<p>OBS has several places to configure audio, but you’ll want to start with adding
your microphone (Yeti Stereo Microphone, in my case) to the Mic/Aux dropdown in
Audio settings:</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/soundsettings.png" alt="Sound settings"></p>
<h3 id="microphone">Microphone <a href="#microphone" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h3>
<p>I use a <a href="https://amzn.to/3enL1dl">Blue Yeti</a> mic, which is a popular choice and
a good mix of price and quality. I have it mounted to my desk with a <a href="https://amzn.to/300NSE8">boom
arm</a>, so I can bring the microphone close to my face
without it getting in the way of my keyboard, and a <a href="https://amzn.to/2BWkjM1">shock
absorber</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3082aCG">pop filter</a> to
avoid distracting sibilant noises and vibrations from any furious typing or
desk bumps that might ensue. I wrote about this more in my <a href="https://jordanlewis.org/posts/desk-setup-2020">desk setup
post</a>.</p>
<p>The advantage of bringing the mic close to your face with a boom is that it
allows you to lower the gain on the microphone to avoid noises that are not
your voice. Even with a low gain, though, the microphone is very sensitive, and
it’ll pick up noises like fans, air conditioners, or your partner’s phone
calls. OBS has several filters that you can apply to your Microphone input to
help suppress this background noise, like Compressor, Expander, Limiter, and
Noise Suppression. There’s a lot of discussion about this on the OBS forums and
around the web that I won’t rehash, but after copious testing with different
settings and levels of background noise, I’ve come to the conclusion that the
best filter for me is the Noise Suppression filter at -20 dB. This will almost
certainly be different for you - try things out!</p>

<p>When you test your stream out, if you notice that there’s an issue with the
synchronization between your mouth moving in your video and the sound of your
speech, you can tweak that in the Advanced Audio Properties settings in OBS.
I had to add 130ms delay from my microphone to compensate for the latency of
the capture card that I use for my webcam - of course, this will vary depending
on your setup.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/advancedaudiosettings.png" alt="Advanced audio settings"></p>
<p>The way that I test this is by using the Start Recording feature in OBS, and
recording myself clapping several times. Then, I open the video in VLC and play
it back in slow motion, trying to line up the sharp sound of the clap with the
image of my hands hitting each other. It’s kind of hard!</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, this must be why movie producers use those iconic
clapboards and not their hands - it’s probably much easier to see exactly when
the two halves of the clapboard hit each other than two hands.</p>
<h3 id="desktop-sound-capture">Desktop Sound Capture <a href="#desktop-sound-capture" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h3>
<p>I have to admit that getting desktop capture sound right on OBS on Mac is kind
of a pain. I use <a href="https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower">SoundFlower</a>,
which is an open source kernel extension that allows you to set your audio
output to a device that programs can then use as an input source. This allows
OBS to listen to all of your computer’s sound output.</p>
<p>In order to also listen to that same desktop sound, you’ll need to make an
“aggregate device” in the Audio MIDI Setup program, and include both your
headphones and the Soundflower device. Then, you’ll set your computer’s output
device to that new aggregate device you’ve created.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can shell out the $99 for
<a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/">Loopback</a> from Rogue Amoeba, which does all
of this (and more) in a much easier way.</p>
<p>Anyway, once you get this all set up, you’ll want to add your Soundflower or
Loopback output device as your Desktop Audio device.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll be able to see the levels for both of these devices in the Audio
Mixer at the bottom of your stream and adjust them on the fly.</p>

<p>Okay, you’ve tweaked OBS to your liking, set up your webcam and microphone, and
created some scenes. Now, how do you actually go ahead and start streaming?</p>
<p>First things first, you’ll need to create your Twitch account, if you don’t have
one already. The Twitch documentation is quite good, according to my expert
tech writer colleague <a href="https://amrutaranade.com/">Amruta</a>, so you should check
out their
<a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/creating-an-account-with-twitch">docs</a> for
more info on that.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got your account set up, you’ll need to find your Stream Key on the
Twitch website and enter it into OBS’s Stream settings.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/streamsettings.png" alt="Stream settings"></p>
<p>Once that’s done, all you have to do to start your live stream is to take a
deep breath, smile at the camera, and hit the Start Streaming button in OBS.
That’s it: now you’re live! Have fun.</p>

<p>Stream alerts are a fun way of encouraging people to follow or subscribe to
your channel. When someone follows, subscribes, gifts a sub, raids or hosts
your stream, or sends bits, having a stream alert configured will play a gif, a
sound, and display the name of the person who performed the action along with
the thing that they did.</p>
<p>I use the <a href="https://streamlabs.com/">StreamLabs</a> Alert Box for my stream alerts.
It’s very easy to use, and free. Once you’ve configured the alert box on the
StreamLabs website, you add it to your stream as a Browser source. When
somebody interacts with your stream, StreamLabs will send the alert to the
webpage that the source is pointing at, and it’ll do its thing. This is less
confusing than it sounds, and StreamLabs has pretty good instructions on their
site for how to set it up.</p>
<p>My follower alert looks like this (on stream, the blue background is
transparent):</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/followalert.gif" alt="Follow alert"></p>
<p>You can have a lot of fun with these! I picked a bunch of different gifs
for each alert type, and to further personalize things, I found some movie
quotes on <a href="http://www.quodb.com/">QuoDB</a> where people say something related to
data banks, found clips of them online, and created mp3s to play when people
subscribe. You can also have StreamLabs play a random mp3 from a set, to keep
things fresh as people follow or sub.</p>
<h2 id="sound-in-stream-alerts">Sound in Stream Alerts <a href="#sound-in-stream-alerts" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h2>
<p>Besides just being exciting for your viewers, stream alerts also serve another
purpose: to make a noise so that you know to react to the exciting follow, sub
or raid that just came your way! There’s just one problem, though, which is that
you need to make the alert play both to your stream and into your headphones,
without playing twice.</p>
<p>This is troublesome if you’re doing desktop audio capture! By default, the
Browser source will play audio directly into the stream’s mix, and not output
locally. This sounds good for your viewers, but not for you, the streamer. For
you to be able to hear the alert yourself while streaming, you’ll need to check
the “Control Audio via OBS” box in the Browser source, and then set the Audio
Monitoring dropdown in Advanced Audio Properties to “Monitor and Output” (you
can see this in action in the <a href="#audio">audio section</a>.</p>
<p>This will output both to your stream and to your configured Monitor audio out.
Careful, though - if your monitor audio out is the same audio output that’s
getting captured by Soundflower or Loopback, your viewers will hear a doubled
sound. To avoid this, make sure your Monitoring device is set to your
headphones in OBS’s Audio Settings.</p>

<p>Once you’ve gotten your stream going, you’ll probably want to use Twitch’s
tools to fill out your page to help give your stream a unique look and branding,
and to help viewers understand what your stream is about. There are a several
things to take care of here, and just like the rest of this setup, you’ll
probably want to start simple here and enhance it over time as you see fit.</p>

<p>Twitch gives every stream an opportunity to list its category. Since Twitch
started as and is still primarily a gaming website, most of the categories are
individual games.</p>
<p>There are several non-gaming categories. The one that live coders use is called
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Science%20%26%20Technology">Science &amp;
Technology</a>,
so I use that as well. The category is also a great way of finding other
programming streamers to watch, get inspired by, or learn from.</p>
<p>Twitch also allows you to give your stream
<a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/guide-to-tags">tags</a>, which are a further way
to aid stream discovery and help viewers know what your stream is about. I
always tag my stream with the
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/a59f1e4e-257b-4bd0-90c7-189c3efbf917">Programming</a>,
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/cea7bc0c-75a5-4446-8743-6db031b71550">Educational</a>,
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/dff0aca6-52fe-4cc4-a93a-194852b522f0">Engineering</a>,
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/6f86127d-6051-4a38-94bb-f7b475dde109">Software
Development</a>,
and
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/6ea6bca4-4712-4ab9-a906-e3336a9d8039">English</a>
tags.</p>
<p>It’s somewhat hard to tell where viewers come from via Twitch’s analytics,
but for reference, here’s the viewer breakdown from one of my recent streams.
I believe the recommendations and browse page views probably came up because of
my stream’s categories and tags.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/views.png" alt="analytics example"></p>
<h2 id="panels">Panels <a href="#panels" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h2>
<p>Panels are Twitch’s way of giving your channel an “about” section. Each panel
can have an image and some text. It’s a fairly annoying abstraction, to be
honest: each panel image has to be a fixed size, and you don’t have that much
control of how they’re all laid out.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/panels.png" alt="Panels"></p>
<p>You can go text only, but most streams have some images to give the stream a
unified look and feel. I’d eventually like to pay an artist to make some themed
panels and emotes for me, but for now I found some <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/28221943/FREE-Twitch-Panel-Theme-Packs">free panel
images</a>
on Behance that I liked from someone named Anibal Alvarez. Thanks, Anibal!</p>
<h2 id="emotes">Emotes <a href="#emotes" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h2>
<p>You can add custom emotes for your subscribers to use in any chat on Twitch if
you become a <a href="https://affiliate.twitch.tv/">Twitch Affiliate</a>. Emotes are the
lingua franca of expressing feelings on Twitch, and a great way of demonstrating
your support for a channel.</p>
<p>A lot of people like to commission themed emotes for their channels from an
artist. I’d like to do that at some point, but until then, I’ve uploaded a
funny picture of myself that someone added to my work Slack in the image of the
Ancient Aliens guy. See the resemblance?</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/ancient.png" alt="ancient jordan"></p>

<p>There’s also a slot for a banner image on Twitch, which is yet another asset
that you’ll probably want to generate to avoid the default banner look, which
is your Twitch name laid out in a repeating pattern on a plain, colored
background.</p>
<p>I used Preview.app to make mine, and the result is predictably amateur. I
really want to replace this image soon.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/banner.png" alt="Banner"></p>
<p>If you’ve made it this far in the post, and can figure out who the person in
the banner is and how he relates to the title of my stream, congratulations!
You are a nerd.</p>
<h2 id="saving-videos">Saving Videos <a href="#saving-videos" arialabel="Anchor"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a> </h2>
<p>One other important thing to note is that, by default, Twitch will not archive
your stream as videos! You need to turn this setting on. It’s located in the
Channel settings page of the <a href="https://dashboard.twitch.tv/">Creator Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/storebroadcasts.png" alt="Store past broadcasts setting"></p>
<p>Once you’ve enabled this setting, the video from your stream will be saved on
Twitch’s servers for a few weeks. Each video has a handy dandy Export button,
which allows you to permanently save your videos on YouTube (or download them
if you want to do that for some reason). I export all of my videos to YouTube,
trim out the intro and outro, and add them to a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLusTLTHkFrR240f5qGJhywJuLDSxCBm_n">playlist</a>
for archival purposes.</p>
<p>You end up with a lot of YouTube content quickly with this method, and I’m not
exactly sure whether it’s super useful to save the hours and hours of content
that you create streaming raw to YouTube, but most of my stream videos get
several views over time so I imagine somebody must find them useful.</p>

<p>Once your stream starts accumulating viewers, you’ll probably start to notice
that there are some frequently asked questions that new viewers have that start
to get tiresome to answer over and over again. Most channels have a chatbot set
up with commands that you or viewers can type to get the answer to these FAQs.</p>
<p>On my channel, people love to ask what my current project is, what kind of
keyboard I have (I’m kind of asking for this one because I have a webcam
pointing at it all the time), and what my editor is and what color scheme it
uses. So, I have commands for all of these: you can type <code>!project</code>,
<code>!keyboard</code>, <code>!editor</code>, or <code>!theme</code> into the chat and the bot will respond with
the answer.</p>
<p>There are lots of Twitch bots out there. I like to use
<a href="https://nightbot.tv/">Nightbot</a>, which has a good mix of features and is free
and very easy to use. People love to make their own Twitch bots as well (I
notice that it’s one of the most common projects that people do on their
programming channels, actually), but I haven’t needed anything more fancy than
what Nightbot provides.</p>

<p>Twitch has an Affiliate program that you can apply for if your channel hits
certain viewership and followership metrics. Becoming an Affiliate unlocks
several features for your stream, most signifiantly allowing viewers to
subscribe to your channel for a monthly fee, which grants them
<a href="#emotes">emotes</a> to use in any chat room on Twitch, and the
good feeling of supporting a streamer.</p>
<p>Affiliate streams also get a couple of other features for their streams, like
Channel Points, which are a currency that you accumulate while watching the
stream and can redeem for streamer-defined rewards. I haven’t tried playing
around with Channel Points yet.</p>
<p>Getting to affiliate will require some work: you need to have 50 followers, an
average of 3 concurrent viewers per stream, and 500 total broadcast minutes over
at least 7 streams in the past 30 days. But, you can definitely do this if you
put your mind to it!</p>
<p>It took me about 4 months to become a Twitch Affiliate. The hardest requirement
for me was hitting 7 streams a month, which implies needing to stream more than
once per week. When I started, I was streaming every Friday, and one stream per
week is already quite a bit of mental effort! I added a Sunday stream as well,
basically just so I could hit affiliate, but doing it twice a week adds up in
time and energy for sure.</p>
<p>I wasn’t expecting this from the outset, but I found that seeing my friends,
colleagues, and random strangers subscribe to me in support of my stream is a
really wonderful feeling! It motivates me to try hard to make a fun stream
every week.</p>

<p>I want to shout out <a href="https://noopkat.com/projects/">@noopkat</a> for the <a href="https://medium.com/@suzhinton/my-twitch-live-coding-setup-b2516672fb21">awesome
