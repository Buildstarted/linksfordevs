        <p>More than two thousand sites using Extended Validation certificates stopped working this weekend and remain inaccessible today (Monday), including those run by <a href="https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcardrefund.citi.com">banks</a>, <a href="https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.lincolnshire.gov.uk">governments</a>, and <a href="https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foyles.co.uk">online shops</a>. The EV certificates used by these sites were revoked on Saturday, and have yet to be replaced. Most visitors using modern web browsers are completely locked out: this certificate error cannot be bypassed in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.</p>

Last week, DigiCert disclosed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1650910" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">a reporting discrepancy</a> in its audit for EV certificates. As part of its response, DigiCert committed to revoking the certificates, which <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1651828" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">it intends to complete</a> over the coming weeks. Only a subset of DigiCert’s EV certificates are affected: in the July <a href="https://www.netcraft.com/internet-data-mining/ssl-survey/">SSL Server Survey</a>, Netcraft found 17,200 EV certificates in active use on port 443 that are due to be revoked.</p>
<p>The first batch of revocations happened this weekend. While most of the certificates revoked on Saturday 11th July have been correctly replaced and reinstalled, many have not.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, Netcraft found 3,800 sites still using EV certificates issued by the affected sub-CAs. Of these 3,800,&nbsp;more than 2,300 were still using a revoked EV certificate, completely disabling the sites for users in modern browsers, which handle <a href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2014/04/24/certificate-revocation-why-browsers-remain-affected-by-heartbleed.html">EV revocation more robustly</a> than other types of certificate. The remainder are yet to be revoked.</p>
<p>Many organisations appear to have been caught unawares, continuing to use revoked EV certificates, including The <a href="https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmobility.onlinesbi.com">State Bank of India</a>, <a href="https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmybill.rackspace.com">Rackspace</a>, <a href="https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finfo.authorize.net">Authorize.net</a>, <a href="https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.online.anz.com">ANZ Bank</a>, and <a href="https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fanytimeads.telegram.com">Telegram</a>.</p>

<p>Wirecard, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/48271177-9f38-4eaf-b39c-4c74f103662d" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">beleaguered</a> German payment processor, briefly had its main site, <a href="https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wirecard.com">www.wirecard.com</a>, displaying a certificate warning early on Monday, but the certificate has since been replaced with a working non-EV certificate. There are still a <a href="https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs.wirecard.com">number</a> <a href="https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrand.wirecard.com">of</a> Wirecard domains with revoked certificate warnings.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Baseline Requirements</a> and <a href="https://cabforum.org/extended-validation/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">EV Guidelines</a>, the <em>de facto</em> rulebooks for running a CA, define two revocation timelines for subscriber certificates: 24 hours for serious security issues, and 5 days for less severe issues. If a CA fails to meet these deadlines, it is highlighted in subsequent audits. Too many failures, and a CA could go the way of <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/10/24/distrusting-new-wosign-and-startcom-certificates/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">StartCom</a> and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Symantec</a>,&nbsp;resulting in being distrusted and effectively ending its ability to issue certificates that work in modern web browsers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These deadlines apply to <em>all</em> publicly trusted certificates whether they are being used on public websites, embedded in hardware appliances, ATMs, or used in healthcare settings. While often convenient to use for non-browser use cases, it means that deploying publicly trusted certificates must be carefully considered — you may be required to replace compromised certificates with hours of notice, or replace an entire population of certificates within a handful of days.</p>
<p>This expectation of agility is reflected in the continued push to reduce the maximum lifetime of certificates — set to drop to just over one year in September on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211025" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple devices</a>, in <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/ae4d6809912f8171b23f6aa43c6a4e8e627de784" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/07/09/reducing-tls-certificate-lifespans-to-398-days/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Firefox</a>.</p>
<p>However, ACME, the protocol used by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Let’s Encrypt</a>, <a href="https://www.digicert.com/certificate-management/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">DigiCert</a>, <a href="https://sectigo.com/resource-library/sectigos-acme-automation" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Sectigo</a> and others, does not yet have robust, built-in support for replacing certificates promptly when there is a <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/acme/b-RddSX8TdGYvO3f9c7Lzg6I2I4/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">pending revocation</a>. When Let’s Encrypt faced a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619047" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">similar mass revocation incident</a>, its instructions also <a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/revoking-certain-certificates-on-march-4/114864" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">required manual intervention</a> with certbot. Let’s Encrypt also did not meet the 5-day expectation in its response to that incident.</p></div></div></div>
