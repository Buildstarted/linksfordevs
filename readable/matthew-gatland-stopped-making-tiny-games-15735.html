							<h4>When I miss a deadline, you get paid</h4>
							
							<p>I'm Matthew Gatland and I used to make
								<a href="https://www.matthewgatland.com/games/tide/" target="_blank">tiny</a>
								<a href="https://www.matthewgatland.com/games/spaceprotector/" target="_blank">games</a>
								<a href="https://letsbeducks.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">all</a>
								<a href="https://www.matthewgatland.com/100days/winter/" target="_blank">the</a>
								<a href="https://www.matthewgatland.com/games/cerulean/" target="_blank">time</a>. But then something went wrong.</p>
							<p><img src="https://www.matthewgatland.com/anti-patreon/img/1.png" alt="Three ducks standing outside, drawn in low resolution pixel art vaguely in the style of the original Legend of Zelda.">
							 I grew tired, or lazy, or caught up in everyday life. My work slowed down and stopped. It's now been 14 months since I released a game.</p>
							<p>You can help! I don't need your money. I just need some pressure. I need a deadline, and the deadline has to matter so I can't ignore it.</p>
							<p>So here's the deal: from now on, every month, I <i>will</i> release a game. But if I don't, I'll pay each of my anti-patrons 5 New Zealand dollars.</p>
							<p>If I miss the deadline, I have to pay up.</p>
							<p>Hopefully that will be enough pressure to force me back into action. If it's not, you'll find out in your monthy payment email!</p>
							<p><i>To avoid some logistical and legal issues, payments will be in the form of digital Steam gift cards. When you sign up I'll add you as a friend on Steam. We have to be Steam friends for a few days before Steam will let me send you a gift card.</i></p>
							<!--<h4>Technical Details</h4>
							<p>Sending actual money is actually quite difficult. My current plan is to pay you in Steam credit. When you sign up I'll collect your Steam username and add you as a friend. Steam will, <i>in theory</i>, let me send out as many Steam gift cards as I like, as long as they are to people I was already friends with.</p><br>
							<p>If this doesn't work - for example if Steam bans me for suspicious payment behaviour - we'll figure out something else.</p><br>
							<p>I reserve the right to remove or refuse to add anti-patrons for any reason, but especially for being a bad person.</p>-->
