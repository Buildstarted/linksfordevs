The Louvre? French cuisine? The Eiffel Tower perhaps?</p><p id="eae0" data-selectable-paragraph="">What if that same person said they were proud to be Polish? What might you think then? Sauerkraut, endless recipes involving potatoes, or perhaps The Witcher book series?</p><p id="c794" data-selectable-paragraph="">How about German culture? My picks would be savory beer, bratwursts, expansive cathedrals perhaps. I imagine car enthusiasts would immediately picture the BMW or Mercedes brands.</p><p id="ef83" data-selectable-paragraph="">Last one, I promise: What if someone you know exclaims “I’m proud to be <strong>White</strong>!”? What comes to mind then?</p><p id="2e02" data-selectable-paragraph="">People are posting and reposting articles on social media about this topic, and I found one in particular that captured my fancy. In it, the anonymous author airs a laundry list of grievances about how White people can’t have or do anything that celebrates their Whiteness for fear it would be labeled racist. It highlighted the existence of “Black-only” things like the NAACP, BET, the United Negro College Fund, and how White people can’t have “White-only versions” of these things because that would be “racist.”</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="An aryan woman locking arms with but looking down upon a darker woman." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*JJyjbywP-NJpARayXM98xA.jpeg?q=20" width="500" height="352"></p><p><img alt="An aryan woman locking arms with but looking down upon a darker woman." width="500" height="352" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*JJyjbywP-NJpARayXM98xA.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*JJyjbywP-NJpARayXM98xA.jpeg 500w" sizes="500px" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*JJyjbywP-NJpARayXM98xA.jpeg"></p></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">This propaganda slide depicts friendship between an Aryan woman and a black woman as a loss of racial pride. The caption says: “The experience/Racial pride fades.” Germany, ca. 1933–1939. Note how the Aryan woman is seated higher than her partner so as to look down upon her.</figcaption></figure><p id="3a09" data-selectable-paragraph="">The author carries on with more examples: the Miss America beauty pageant, and how anyone can register to enter, but only black participants can enter into the Miss Black America Pageant, and how Black officers can arrest White citizens without being accused of racism, but not the other way around. After several more examples, the author wraps up their article by suggesting rhetorically that it seems only White people can be accused of being racist, and that they aren’t allowed to be proud of their skin tone. <em>In a final stroke of the pen, the author suggests that everything above is a sign of decline for White people’s rights and privileges going back decades.</em></p><p id="d8c0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Laboring under the presumption of positive intent (a difficult task, I must confess), the author triggered a few questions in my mind: What and where is the country of origin for <em>White people</em>, and what kind of food originates from there? What is their official language, and are they a democratic republic like the United States?</p><p id="b97f" data-selectable-paragraph="">My questions seem rhetorical, but hear me out: what comes to mind when you hear exclamations of White pride? What do you think the author is trying to convey to you?</p><p id="8856" data-selectable-paragraph="">As a product of America’s public education system, a few examples come to my mind: the annexation of land belonging to Native Americans, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Slave Triangle</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Colonialism</a>. In fact, the longer I dwell on the term “Whiteness”, the more things come to mind: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_tax" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Poll Taxes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Juneteenth</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tuskegee Experiment</a>. Strangely enough, I can’t think of any positive examples by a group that felt their Whiteness was key to their success. If we had the chance to travel back in time and ask the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wright Brothers</a> the reason for their success, do you think they would say it was preordained because of their skin attributes?</p><p id="e4a7" data-selectable-paragraph="">You <em>know</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Whataboutism</a> has reached a stunning precipice when someone holds up historically significant minority-focused institutions as justification for a return to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separate_but_equal" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Separate But Equal</a>. It has me wondering: Did the author <em>sleep through</em> that part of U.S. History in their education, or does it simply <em>hit differently</em> for privileged students than students of color?</p><p id="eb3e" data-selectable-paragraph="">I’m reminded of a scene from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</a> that perfectly captures this gluttony: to set the stage, it’s Dudley Dursley’s eleventh birthday, and he asks his mother how many presents he gets to open this year, to which his mother replies thirty-six. Dudley reacts rather poorly to this new information, descending into a fit of rage because he remembered getting thirty-seven presents the year prior! Mind you, as this scene plays out, Harry Potter (who is lucky to even get table scraps for dinner every night) is looking onward as if watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Groundhog Day</a> on repeat.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="A portrait (from left to right) of Dudley, Vernon, and Petunia Dursley" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*u9LQkGHS2xI_xQ30?q=20" width="480" height="240"></p><p><img alt="A portrait (from left to right) of Dudley, Vernon, and Petunia Dursley" width="480" height="240" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*u9LQkGHS2xI_xQ30 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/960/0*u9LQkGHS2xI_xQ30 480w" sizes="480px"></p></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">The Dursleys</figcaption></figure><p id="7824" data-selectable-paragraph="">When I hear phrases like “embrace your Whiteness”, I have to wonder: does it encourage people to say “not my problem” when a black man shouts “I can’t breathe!”? Does it mean that a shoulder shrug is an appropriate response to a video of an unarmed black man being shot in the back? If it was Harry’s birthday, and he asked for one shiny gift-wrapped present with a bow on top, I think we all can imagine Harry’s uncle, Vernon, shrugging his shoulders and saying “Not my problem!” <em>This is what </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willful_blindness" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>willful ignorance</em></a><em>, fueled by hatred, looks like.</em></p><p id="cb99" data-selectable-paragraph="">All colors and creeds have skeletons in their closet, to be sure. While the subject of Human Rights abuse isn’t confined <em>just</em> to those who<em> embrace their whiteness</em>, <strong>what makes White Pride troubling is its obsession with attributes of physical appearance, and no other markers of community like a place, language, or a shared history.</strong> It doesn’t evoke a love for the origin of hot dogs (Germany), Post-Impressionism Art (France), or Classical Music (all of Europe, really), nor does it harken back to the glory days of battles past, or key moments of positivity and inclusivity in history. It is simply <em>Whataboutism</em> in its most venomous form: an invitation to deny a shared history of systemic oppression (<em>and the role hatred plays in it</em>), and double down on the perverted pride of <em>not</em> being Black. Instead of exerting pride in <em>actual </em>cultures and<em> </em>events, it suggests that radical elements like the KKK, and the White Pride World Wide initiative are not that bad <em>really</em>, and Its only purpose is to maintain the ignorance of <em>law &amp; order</em>, amidst the backdrop of fathers, brothers, and sons shouting “I can’t breathe!”</p><p id="c340" data-selectable-paragraph="">#blacklivesmatter</p></div></div></section></div></div></div>
