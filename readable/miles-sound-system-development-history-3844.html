</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with source platform overrides when building from the command line.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.45.1 - Jan 13, 2020</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] Fix for serialization of source platform overrides.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.45 - Nov 19, 2019</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] Play voice actions with invalid/missing priority classes now auto-pass text filters in the Assets tab, so you
can find them by doing e.g. "@priority=missing"
</li><li> [Studio] Designers can now adjust the platform deployment for a source on an event that uses the source.
</li><li> [Studio] Convolution Reverb IRs can be overridden on a per IR, per platform basis by creating a subfolder under ImpulseReponses
that matches the name of the target platform.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where per-action user preferences would be applied to all actions in an event.
</li><li> [Studio] Voice priority classes and priority groups can be overridden per platform.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where priority ranges could be zero, resulting in random eviction order.
</li><li> [Studio] Sources can override their WAV file on a per platform basis.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a but where the graph at the top of the Client Debugger could show the wrong number of events.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.44 - Nov 7, 2019</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio/Runtime] Added State Switching. Group states in to a Switcher with an attached controller to cause Miles to
automatically migrate between those states using a default transition, optionally overriding the transition. Switches
can also "hold" the first state chosen when the voice is created.
</li><li> [Studio] Specifying --console on the command line in Miles Studio will show the debug Windows console.

</li><li> [Studio] Memory usage improvements related to languages (only the selected language is kept in memory)
</li><li> [Studio] Memory usage improvements related to large compress caches.
</li><li> [Studio] Adding a language no longer causes every Source to need to be saved to disc with changes.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a hitch when recompressing sources.

to all languages.
</li><li> [Studio] Recompressing all wav files is faster.
</li></ul>

<h2><span><b> 10.0.43 - Oct 4, 2019</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] Improved the Performance tab in the client debugger.
</li><li> [Studio] Client Debugger piano now auto scrolls with the full view being utilized instead of half.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug when reordering priority classes.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with undoing changes that affect snapshot groups.

</li><li> [Studio] Added a basic copy/paste to state layers.
</li><li> [Studio] The priority classes view can be resized now.
</li><li> [Studio] Undo no longer resets the properties scroll position.
</li><li> [Studio/Runtime] Added "Named Streams", allowing external audio sources (voice chat, synthesizers)
to be referenced as Sources from within Miles Studio. To use, create a top level folder "NamedStreams"
in the Sources list and create a source as normal under that folder, then reference it in an event.
The example "hl_named_streams" demostrates how to pass that audio to the Miles runtime.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a flag to output the list of events that were excluded from project rendering,
and why (--trimmed-event-log-file).
</li><li> [Studio] Added several Miles Studio performance counters to try and track down some issues. (Help-&gt;View Performance)
</li><li> [Studio] Some project load optimizations
</li><li> [Studio] Sources that are considered "temporary" for any reason are rendered in grey. Hovering over the Source in the Sources
list will show a tooltip saying the reason.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a crash when opening the client debugger without a project loaded.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a crash when a repeating state has a delay and ends at the exact same time as it is muted.
</li></ul>

<h2><span><b> 10.0.42 - August 30, 2019</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] Duplicate priority class now copies all fields.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed several issues with sleeping events
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.41 - August 27, 2019</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where the event csv remapper would crash if the target event existed in a folder other than the one being operated on.
</li><li> [Studio] Dramatic optimization of moving or renaming assets.
</li><li> [Studio] More Perforce operations are batched - dramatic speedup on some operations.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a couple bugs with moving layers up or down in play voice actions.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with cancelling the "add controller" dialog in the preview window
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.40 - August 20, 2019</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where priorty class names could end up white on white.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where priority class controllers couldn't be assigned.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where the assets tab would crash when sources were recompressed.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where trying to sync the graph view to the graph data in a graph template would crash.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where syncing a project change while a voice was sleeping during auditioning could sometimes crash.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where editing a priority class without another project-wide change wouldn't get sent with "Sync Clients".
</li><li> [Unreal] Exiting Play-in-editor now kills all running voices.
</li><li> [Unreal] Added basic auditioning support.
</li><li> [Studio] In the client debugger, the events view and the priority view now incorporate event coloring.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where maximizing Miles Studio by double clicking the title bar with the priority tab open would change the selection.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where "Edit"ing a Play Voice action in the assets tab wouldn't properly sync the Bank tab events list selection if
"Hide Actions" had been set.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added Priority Class Group Limits, which allow Priority Classes to be assigned to groups, each with a voice limit. Voices
in the priority classes of a priority class group all count towards that limit, providing multiple tiers of voice limiting withing
the priority class system.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.39 - August 11, 2019</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] Client Debugger now has a 3d view in addition to the 2d view of events.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where large numbers of errors/warnings would prevent the dialog box from showing up when rendering projects.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a color property to Events. This color isn't used everywhere yet - in the voices and 2d/3d view in the
client debugger. Can be edited in the Assets view, as well as Event Properties.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where voices could sometimes pick the wrong bus for output and not tell you about it. Sometimes this would
result in a crash.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where mute trigger levels would cause affected voices to always fade in.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.38 - July 22, 2019</b></span></h2>

<ul>
<li> [Runtime] Fixed a minor bug where random layer volumes would get generated twice.
</li><li> [Studio] Controllers can now specify a graph template that will automatically get set
as the transform when the controller is assigned.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a warning when synced voices have incompatible source selector layouts (i.e.
wouldn't not stay in sync)
</li><li> [Studio] Added a sync button to sync the view to the actual graph width when editing transforms.
</li><li> [Runtime] Lots of Switch optimizations.
</li><li> [Studio] A variety of UI improvements in the client debugger. Stop and Named signals are shown on the
voice timeline, with more visibility in to voices that weren't audible for some reason (data mute or
starvation).
</li><li> [Studio] Miles Studio will now properly warn when an asset is created that would cause a duplicate name
when Flatten Event Names is set. If such names exist on load, then there's a fallback resolution path
for renaming to get rid of those errors.
</li><li> [Runtime] Priority Classes can now blend two adjustment types. This is generally used to combine age with
distance, to avoid some annoying degenerate cases when you just use one or the other with things like footsteps.
</li><li> [Studio] Active voices when auditioning or previewing will show their priority as they play on the priority classes
tab with a little dot, for help with visualizing.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added an experimental priority proximity suppression system. This system lowers the priority of other
voices in the same priority class that are in the same direction. This is to try and manage situations where
voices that are in two groups, each in a distinct direction (i.e. one left one right), don't have one group
dominate the voice counts because all of the voices are slightly closer than all of the voices in the other group.
</li></ul>

<h2><span><b> 10.0.37 - June 15, 2019</b></span></h2>

<ul>
<li> BREAKING CHANGE - The voice selection/priority system has been migrated from buses
to Priority Classes. The upgrade system should minimize any changes. In addition,
Distance Sleeping Events have been updated to be per-voice, and so are now Distance
Sleeping Voices. The person integrating the update should save the project before
checking in the upgrade, as a new file will be created, and that should exist on
disc before multiple users start using the new version.
</li><li> [Runtime] IMPORTANT BUGFIX - Specifying the channels on a bus never worked! In the
assets view, verify that any bus not set to "Default" channels are buses you expect.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with BPM detection in WAV file names.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with viewing Source properties with very short WAV files.
</li><li> [Studio] The assets tab no longer searches automatically when the timer expires.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a driver parameter to cap the maximum level output to the hardware.
Some audio devices handle full utilization of the output range poorly. This defaults
to 32600 / 32767
</li><li> Lots of Client Debugger improvements. Most notably is the introduction of the Priority
view, which shows a moment-in-time view of voices.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with completion transitions on infinite layers.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug for extremely long running events with thousands of layers crashing.
</li><li> [Runtime] Muting and unmuting a voice now fades over ~300 ms.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with using shift to expand selections in the events list.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a new API for specifying the priority class for an event to be
used by all voices it starts. The old Priority Adjust api has been removed.
</li><li> [Studio] Events previewed in Miles Studio are now visible in the Client Debugger.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a crash with editing clean options as a result of a corruption.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with dragging sources where the selection cross folder boundaries.
</li><li> [Runtime/Studio] Solo/mute now works for nested events (i.e. run events and loop segment events)
</li><li> [Studio] In the Assets tab, ctrl-c now can copy the asset name to the clipboard.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a new API for prefetching an event - all sources for the event will have
very low priority prefetch queued.
</li><li> [Runtime] Inactive (muted) voices now have lower IO priority.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added congestion control to random selectors. When IO is determined to be under
load, random nodes will drop randomization in favor or re-using sources that
are in memory.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for edit boxes in other windows not working when the assets tab is open.
</li><li> [Runtime] Retain is now in seconds, and has an option to be infinite.
</li><li> [Runtime] The I/O latency simulation has been pushed to a lower (more accurate) level.
</li><li> [Runtime] I/O has been updated to a page prefetching model to support new IO features
</li><li> [Studio] Voice Layers can now be "cloned" when editing.
</li><li> [Studio] In the Assets tab, names can be searched using basic wildcards (* and ?).
</li><li> [Runtime] Various runtime performance improvements, especially with muted voices.
</li><li> [Studio] In the Assets tab, string properties no longer pass filter checks when empty.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a crash with Run Event Actions and deleted events.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fix for xaudio occasionally locking when transitioning to the null device.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where dragging sources in a certain way could corrupt a source selector.
</li><li> [General] Miles documentation has been updated from CHM to a single searchable HTML file.
</li></ul>

<h2><span><b> 10.0.36 - Mar 17, 2019</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with controller selectors.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.35 - Mar 15, 2019</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] BREAKING CHANGE - Mute/pause has been removed in favor of Distance Sleeping Events. Buses
that had a mute/pause level specified now are only mute.
</li><li> [Studio] BREAKING CHANGE - 3D graphs must now be bound to AutoDistance, and can no longer be arbitrarily assigned to
controllers. Any such graphs will be updated to AutoDistance.
</li><li> [Studio] Miles Studio no longer requires deprecated sources to be present on disc for renders.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a flag for marking events as temporary. These events respond to the temp render flags
the same way as sources.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where events wouldn't get properly deprecated if they had a source that was
deprecated.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added "Distance Sleeping Events". Events can be flagged to automatically go to sleep when
their distance to the listener exceeds the radius specified for the event under Event Defaults. Events
will go to sleep at 120% of that distance, and wake back up at 110% of that distance.
</li><li> [Studio] Dramatically sped up rendering large projects with a manifest specified.
</li><li> [Studio] Random weights for source selection can now be set directly, and are explicitly shown
(as opposed to just the resulting % chance).
</li></ul>

<h2><span><b> 10.0.34 - Feb 15, 2019</b></span></h2>

<ul>
<li> [Studio] Fix for compress cache corruption in projects with more than 512k wav files.
</li><li> [Studio] Client Debugger now shows the correct initial priority for voices.
</li><li> [Runtime] MilesEventGetDetails now no longer tries to adjust the expected event length
with the event pitch, as there are many other pitches, and it's usually random anyway.
</li><li> [Runtime] Planar spatialization now handles 4 channel devices properly, and also now correctly
falls back to vector spatialization on unhandled formats.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where bus channel counts were displayed incorrectly in the assets tab.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with previewing planar spatialization inside Miles Studio.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with END transition timing and random loop segments.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with non-infinite loop counts and random loop segments.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a way to extract single events and dependencies in to a designated folder on disc,
including wav files.
</li><li> [Studio] Added --no-compress-cache to force a rebuild of the compress cache when building projects
from the command line.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for language indices being off by one.
</li><li> [Runtime] Mute/pause voice performance improved.
</li><li> [Runtime] SIMD mixer sped up, and fixed a minor bug with volume change ramping.
</li><li> [Runtime] Bus mix sort optimized.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug where hard coded bus priority offsets were ignored.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug when none of the random loop segments are in memory.
</li><li> [Runtime] Minimum Interval restrictions are now respected for Evict Last voices.
</li><li> [Studio] Deprecated events are now ignored in Run Events.
</li><li> [Studio] Signal names are now restricted to alpha numeric.
</li><li> [Runtime] Layer gain dynamics are now evaluated when voices are inactive.
</li><li> [Studio] Radius computation for events now looks for a place on graphs that is above the cutoff dB, before trying
to find where it falls below. Fixes radius computation for middle and far field voices.
</li><li> [Runtime] Layer gain is now included for mute and priority calculations.
</li><li> [Runtime] Loop segment events stop firing once a voice receives the stop signal and is fading out.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug in the client debugger with the # of active voices being displayed.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed some bugs with displaying the computed event radius.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a way to reset a "held" controller, in cases where the game code
predictively passes a value, expecting to be able to correct it later.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a flag to control whether all layers must complete before
the completion transition will fire, or just the primary.
</li><li> [Studio] Perforce edits with huge numbers of files are way faster now.
</li><li> [Runtime] The first loop segment event now fires when the voice begins, instead of when its created.
</li><li> [Runtime] Prototype planar spatialization now blends offplane vectors to all speakers.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for deprecating temp sources.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for nested event - source - event deprecation. Meaning, if a source deprecates an event, then all of the sources
in that event also get deprecated.
</li><li> [Studio] Leaving perforce information empty will attempt to use environment variables for login/port.
</li><li> [Runtime] Random start markers tries to avoid markers that aren't in memory yet.
</li><li> [Runtime] Random Loop Segment Events are now only fired by the primary layer. This includes the exit cue event.
</li><li> [Runtime] Bink Audio bit decoder has been optimized (some more)
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with projects being rendered multiple times with Deprecated events.
</li><li> [Runtime] All layers in a state jump to the exit cue, when that flag is set (instead of just the primary layer)
</li><li> [Studio] Readahead byte amount for sources now exposed in Miles Studio.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with hardcoded FX chain constants.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with random selector state.
</li><li> [Studio] Previewing events in Miles Studio can now be recorded to a WAV file.
</li></ul>

<h2><span><b> 10.0.33 - Oct 18, 2018</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] MilesEventGetDetails now reports if the event needs continual orientation updates, or only
once.
</li><li> [Runtime] Random List selectors now avoid the last entry used when reshuffling the list.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed an issue with WASAPI outputs where switched between devices with different sample rates
could crash or lock.
</li><li> [Studio] Most sources of property randomization have been migrated to the "Random Range" style, in order
to support randomizer synchronization.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed an issue with clearing a filter chain template from the assets view.
</li><li> [Studio] Randomizers are now indexed, allowing for generated values to be locked for a desired amount of time. The
default randomizer acts as before, always generating a new value. Others default to locking the value for the lifetime
of the event.
</li><li> [Studio] Support for loading Really Old Projects has been removed - this shouldn't affect anyone. If it does, use 10.0.32
and save to latest.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a way for Miles Studio to provide the same preloads to auditioning clients as a normal render would. This is
disabled by default to prevent Miles Studio from having to access the disc when clients connect - expect longer "hitches"
when games connect to Miles Studio when this is enabled. This is controlled by Main Menu -&gt; Audition -&gt; Fast Game Connect. When
enabled, Miles will not access the disc when games connect, but will not be a true representation of the preload.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed several crashes associated with a consistency failure due to snapshots somehow not getting saved when a filter
on a bus is removed.
</li><li> [Studio] Planar Spatialization can now be specified when running replays via Tools -&gt; Run Replay.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with pausing events.
</li><li> [Runtime] Planar Spatialization now rotates the listener basis before projecting, to prevent sounds below you when
looking down sounding behind.
</li><li> [Runtime/Studio] Event Radius is now computed on build, rather than on demand via EventGetDetails. The default dB cutoff
is specified in Project Settings (-40 dB), the cutoff can be manually overridden on a per event basis. In addition, the
radius can be manually specified on a per event basis.
</li><li> [Runtime] EventGetDetails now includes radius and controller information from Run Event actions.
</li><li> [Studio] Sources can now be marked temporary explicitly, instead of only via temp/final directories.
</li><li> [Runtime] Random Loop Markers Segments can now run an event when a marker is first jumped to.
</li><li> [Studio/Runtime] Added "Named Signal Transitions". Transitions between states can now signaled by a string queued via
MilesQueueEventSignal, instead of just when a controller becomes positive. Such transitions only fire once, preventing the
need for complicated selection graphs on controllers and mappings of indeces to states.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.32 - Sept 3, 2018</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Auditioning] Changing project settings and doing a "Sync Client" now saves the running events and destroys
them, reloading them afterwards instead of trying to keep voices running across the recreation. This should
fix several spurious crashes, however random volumes and pitches will be reselected for active voices. Please
report any major anomalies!
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for marker tool tips.
</li><li> [Studio] Controllers with "Hold First Value" can now be previewed in Miles Studio in a useful way.
</li><li> [Runtime] States can now reevaluated the manual position for an event on entry. This allows repeat actions
to change their event's position each time they repeat.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where Sources couldn't be moved to another folder as a group.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added the ability for a transition timed to end on a loop boundary to jump to the exit cue afterwards.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added randomized marker segments to source playback. To enable, specify a loop start marker for
a voice state. Once specified, a checkbox below will cause Miles to use the loop start marker as a set
of markers to randomly play, avoiding repeats. Each segment plays until the following marker, whether
or not it matches the loop start marker specification.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where draging a bus send to itself causes a stack overflow crash.
</li><li> [Runtime] Using a marker for a start position, loop start position, or loop end position now matches
any marker that /starts with/ the given string, instead of requiring an exact match. If multiple matches
exist, one is randomly selected. Repeats are allowed.
</li><li> [Runtime] Several fixes for state transition, including allowing multiple layers in states other than the initial state.
</li><li> [Runtime] MilesEventGetDetails has been updated to provide controller names as well as enough information to
know what event setup queue functions are needed for a given event (e.g. position, orientation).
</li><li> [Studio] Function controllers now have a min and max value, and correctly respond to out-of-bounds
like Game controllers. As a result, they also now have a slider when setting their value in Preview Controls.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a helper dialog to compute the BPM for a file given a number of beats in the file.
</li><li> [Runtime] Beats / Minute can now go up to 64000.
</li><li> [Runtime] BREAKING CHANGE DEPENDING ON PROJECT - Bus fader values now interpolate the final value ONLY instead of each
independent snapshot. This fixes a subtle bug where if a bus fader had multiple snapshot groups targeting
it, accumulation would be incorrect and double count the base bus value. Fixing this breaks current mixing
levels, but the value used will now be the expected value.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug when closing Miles Studio with a game still connected.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added "stingers" to transitions. Transitions can now start a source when they are fired,
in addition to the transition source that starts on the transition timing.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added the ability to "Sleep" events, which removes them from active processing. Major state
is saved, but transitionary state is not.
</li><li> [Runtime] Improved performance for temp asset deprecation during builds.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for highlighting playing sources in events with Run actions.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a pop on voices with multiple layers.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed crash in Graph Templates
</li><li> [Runtime] Misc performance fixes
</li><li> [Studio] Adding performance measures to Miles Studio.
</li></ul>

</li><li> [Studio] Added a search filter to the Assets view to find on action index (@action = number)
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a variety of minor read prioritization bugs and improved the congestion model.
</li><li> [Studio] Massive improvements to the Asyncs view in the client debugger. Now called "Reads", it allows for skipping to
data mutes/delays and starvation, as well as better monitoring of the read backlog. Also, the reason for the data
delay is now shown.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a flag that controls whether a voice will continue to advance in time when waiting for data, or will
pause instead. Defaults to pause.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.30 - May 17, 2018</b></span></h2>

<ul>
<li> [Runtime] Optimized common usage patterns for the Compressor filter.
</li><li> [Runtime] Routes (sends) can now spatialize to any channel count, not just the output hardware channels.
</li><li> [Studio] Keyboard navigation improvements to the Assets tab: Ctrl-tab to switch tabs, tab to move between assets/filters, +/- adjusts
some basic types (more as demanded), the current view follows keyboard navigation in the assets list, shift + up/down extends the
asset selection, and ctrl-f moves the focus to the asset filter.
</li><li> [Studio] The number keys load the corresponding project in the Load Recent dialog when opening Miles Studio.
</li><li> [Runtime] Performance improvements to the Convolution Reverb.
</li><li> [Runtime] The center and lfe channels now properly use the center impulse response in the Convolution Reverb.

<h2><span><b> 10.0.24 - Dec 19, 2017</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Runtime] Fixed an issue with distance scaling and snapshots, when the baseline mix value was not attached to a controller.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added Linux x64 and Arm32 platforms, defaulting to ALSA output.
</li><li> [Runtime] A capture API has been added, but is currently implemented only on linux.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where marking a tree of events as deprecated wouldn't work.
</li><li> [Runtime] The default voice orientation has been updated to be in line with the default listener orientation.
</li><li> [Studio] Added the ability to specify the direction and distance of an event from Miles Studio. The event is
placed on the same 2d plane as the listener (identified by forward and left vectors), and is not moved after creation.
Event's with manual positioning ignore positioning specified by the game. This position can also be in world coordinates,
which will use the X/Z plane in that case.
</li><li> [Studio] Added Random and Oscillator controller types.
</li><li> [Studio] Added the ability to timelock a source selector. When a voice selects a branch or child in a selector,
if timelocked, the voice will 'lock' the result for the given time in milliseconds. Any voice that uses that selector
during that time will use the same result, until the lock expires. Then a new result is chosen using the selectors
rules.
</li><li> [Runtime] Miles no longer reports that there is no audio device on systems with no audio device if the game
requested a null or memory output device.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a crash when right clicking certain properties in the Assets view.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a crash when sorting by name or type in the Assets view.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed an incredibly annoying glitch in bink audio decoding that occurs when the system memcpy takes advantage of
the 'overlapping buffers are undefined' behavior.
</li><li> [Studio] Notes and labels can be edited from the Assets view, and can be used as a search filter.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a basic Gain filter. Currently for performance this filter alters the final volume scaling instead of
running a full buffer multiply, and as such will not work correctly when placed before a non-linear filter
(e.g compressor, gainblock).
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a crash when undoing a deleted bank.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with volume and pitch controllers bound to Layers.
</li><li> [Studio] Added the ability to randomize most properties that can be bound to a controller. The result is selected from a range
and can be directed to favor mid, low, high, or none.
</li></ul>

<h2><span><b> 10.0.23 - Nov 2, 2017</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] Added a way to hide the individual actions in the events list (right click on an event to see the option)
</li><li> [Studio] The assets view now retains the bulk copy properties after an asset refresh.
</li><li> [Studio] Properties bound to graph templates now show the controller in the Assets tab.
</li><li> [Studio] Added the ability to mark an event "deprecated", which prevents the event from being compiled when the
project is rendered.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed an issue where in high traffic auditions, the game and Miles Studio could get stuck waiting for
each other to receive data.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed an issue with multichannel send delays.
</li><li> [Studio] MilesEventReferencesControllers has been updated to be consistent with what the event compiler believes
the event uses.
</li><li> [Runtime] Drivers will now report when no audio devices seem to be present.
</li><li> [Runtime] Stop transitions now always ignore transition lockouts.
</li><li> [Studio] Added filter chain templates. Events and Play actions can assign a filter template, which defines the filters on
the asset. Filter parameters can be overridden at any level, and everything is propogated to "children". E.g. if an event
selects a filter template, all of the play actions in that event will use that template, and if the event overrides a given
property, all of the play actions will inherit that override. Filter chain templates can be created from an existing filter
chain, or in the Templates tab. The templates tab also provides a way to find all assets that have the same filter structure,
allowing all to be set to the template. Currently, filter templates do not work for buses.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug where send delay buffers could be leaked in certain use cases.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with setting voice position on uncompressed sources.
</li><li> [Studio] Graphs of Time properties no longer use 16 million as the vertical axis when editing.
</li><li> [Studio] The results from controllers and graphs are now properly clamped to property limits to prevent out-of-bounds results.
</li><li> [Runtime] The convolution reverb has been more optimized to handle longer impulse responses.
</li><li> [Runtime] The convolution reverb now properly handles changes to the selected impulse response while
audio is running through the filter.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for volume min/max variance not being properly editable when a controller is bound.
</li><li> [Studio] Source selector nodes can be marked as "Latches", which prevents further evaluations of the source
node <i>for the same voice</i> from selecting a different branch.
</li><li> [Runtime] Smoothing controllers should now work in all cases.
</li><li> [Studio] Graph Templates now have a menu option (off the gear) to mark users of the graph as audition dirty so that edits
can be applied during audition.
</li><li> [Studio] The Assets view now defaults to NOT automatically overridding inherited values when setting properties. To allow
the old behavior, there is a checkbox at the top of the tab.
</li><li> [Studio] Added "Initial Delay" property to events and play actions. Acts as Delay, except only on initial start instead
of every state entry.
</li><li> [Runtime] Adjusted the parametric EQ filter to be more numerically stable.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.22 - Sept 7, 2017</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] Fix for certain configurations of source selectors
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for an upgrade path bug from .16
</li><li> [Studio] Drop highlighting in source selectors is more clear
</li><li> [Runtime] Bus controllers with no bound bus no longer crashes.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for graph template reference resolution failure during load.
</li><li> [Studio] Batch Property Copy has been added to the Assets tab. Multiple properties can be copied from a single
asset, and pasted in to any number of assets. Right click on the property in the assets list heading to add
the property to the batch copy, then right click on the name of an asset and select "Copy Batch Properties".
Once copied, select a set of assets, right click, and select "Paste Batch Properties" to apply.
</li><li> [Runtime] Project recreation due to changes during auditioning has been updated to transition voices to the
new bus hierarchy more consistently.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for a corruption issue with long controller functions.
</li><li> [Runtime] Volume envelopes no longer crash when there is no currently active layer.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for a compress cache issue when Miles Studio shuts down with outstanding compressions.
</li><li> [Runtime] The transition lockout has been removed currently due to being longer than some voices. It will
return at some point with appropriate UI for controlling it.
</li><li> [Runtime] MilesEventGetStarvedVoiceCount now actually returns nonzero when voices starve.
</li><li> [Studio] The edit box for function controllers is now longer.
</li><li> [Studio] Send delays are now editable in the assets view.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fix for multichannel send delays.
</li><li> [Runtime] The max registered convolution reverb count has been upped to 32 for iteration purposes. Note that actually shipping with
this many in active use would likely be a performance issue!
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.21 - Aug 14, 2017</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] IMPORTANT - Compress Cache has been dramatically updated. All sources will be recompressed on project load after
upgrading.
</li><li> [Studio] Compress cache is now unique to the project file.
</li><li> [Studio] Compress cache is now 3 files instead of 1 per source wav.
</li><li> [Studio] Compress cache is now correctly locked for multiple process access, allowing multiple instances of Miles Studio.
Trying to write to a cache that is open for read in another process (ie the project is being rendered) will cause the
source compression to fail, and it will need to be recompressed in Miles Studio.
</li><li> [Studio] Compress cache relative paths are forced relative to the Miles Studio EXE, instead of the OS current directory.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added accessor for hardware starvation count. Increments when the hardware API buffers fall to zero (ie when Miles
isn't getting enough CPU time or has too high of a processing load.)
</li><li> [Runtime] Added play action switches and conditions. Events can have switches, which will play a given play action
based on the value of a controller. Actions can either be bound to a switch, or have a conditional controller, where
the play action will only play if the controller is &gt; 0.
</li><li> [Runtime] Voice priority can now be bound to a controller. What was Zero Priority before is now a separate flag called "Evict Last".
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with muted voices not necessarily ending.
</li><li> [Studio] Copy and Paste now works in the Templates tab list box.
</li><li> [Studio] Template list box can be resized.
</li><li> [Runtime] Priority Offset can now be bound to controllers.
</li><li> [Studio] Properties bound to graphs in the Assets view will now show what controller the property is bound to.
</li><li> [Studio] Controller preview values are now saved any time the project is saved, instead of only when Miles Studio is closed.
</li><li> [Studio] Convert Controllers have been reenabled after a long hiatus.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added an API to decode a saved queue buffer to a human-readable format.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug where if a layer was scheduled to stop before it ever started, it wouldn't ever start, no matter
how far in the future the stop was scheduled.
</li><li> [Studio] Sources now no longer store metadata regarding the file in perforce, preventing sync issues with source data from
creating needless perforce accesses.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a crash with empty play actions in MilesGetEventDetails.
</li><li> [Studio] Auditioning no longer potentially reads the wrong source data when files are updated and recompressed during audition.
</li><li> [Studio] Auditioning performance on the Miles Studio side increased.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.20 - July 26, 2017</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Runtime] Fix for direct controller references being able to provide out-of-bounds values for properties.
</li><li> [Runtime/Studio] The RunEvent action can now select from a list of events based on a controller. Play action conditionals will be SoonTM.
</li><li> [Studio] Controllers can now explicitly declare an initial value in case the game never sets a value.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fix for dynamic route transitions that change the overall length of the route using an incorrect crossfade time.
</li><li> [Runtime] Routed Sends bound to controller values that output to Dynamic Routes (I need better names) now properly update.
</li><li> [Runtime/Studio] Virtual buses can now define a 3D Falloff Bias that is added to the 3D volume for voices that route through
the bus. This falloff can be bound to sample controllers (i.e. distance controllers) to adjust overall falloffs for voices,
and is crossfaded for dynamic routes.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fix for controllers not updating their respective targets when a sample is created, unless the controller is
changed after the voice is activated.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fix for MilesQueueEventStartTime not working since the introduction of state based events.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.19</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Runtime] Fix for a few bugs with non-unity distance scales.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for a Miles Studio crash with controllers bound to route channel levels.
</li><li> [Runtime] Applying a named limit now immediately evicts voices over new voice count limits on buses.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for bus cycle detection and dynamic routes.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.18</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Studio] Notes and string properties in the Assets view can be properly copy and pasted.

</li><li> [Runtime] XBoxOne distribution has been switched to DLLs.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fix for certain crashes with muted samples.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a crash with relative age priority adjustments
</li><li> [Runtime/Studio] Buses can now have multiple primary outputs. Each voice can select its own path by controller, and
the path can change while the voice is running, crossfading over a set number of milliseconds.
</li><li> [Runtime] Stingers are now scheduled from when the state's source starts, rather than when the transition begins.
</li><li> [Runtime] Entry cues now properly adjust the source start times when transitioning voice states.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for right-click deleting sources in a selector could delete the wrong entry.
</li><li> [Studio] Dragging a source on to a selector now clearly shows whether the source will replace or append.
</li><li> [Studio] Sliders have larger thumbs.
</li></ul>
<h2><span><b> 10.0.17</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> [Runtime] Fix for dynamics sometimes not evaluating immediately on voice activation.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for loading older compress caches that were sorted incorrectly.

</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed filter decay samples not working with voices
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a crash with convolution reverbs not updating the impulse response in certain cases during audition syncs.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a crash with copy and pasting sources.
</li><li> [Studio] P4 client specs can now contain . _ and -.
</li><li> [Runtime] Delay and fades now once again default to wall-clock instead of beat-clock.
</li><li> [Runtime] Playing a completed source that has had a new position set no longer rewinds the source.
</li><li> [Studio] Double clicking an entry in a selector list once again auditions it
</li><li> [Studio] Dragging a source on another entry in a list will replace instead of add (unless dragging on the title)
</li><li> [Studio] The Source 'Properties' menu item is now first in the right click menu.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fix for using distance scale in an unapplied snapshot
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for undo crash when undoing action addition/removal.
</li><li> [Studio] Previewing an event in Miles Studio now highlights the source that was selected.
</li><li> [Studio] Preview values for controllers as well as certain dragger positions are now saved across execution.
</li><li> Sources can now have BPM and signature specified for them, as well as an entry and exit cue marker. Currently
BPM and signature are constant across the entire source. Beats are tracked from the entry cue marker.
</li><li> [Studio] Source Properties now renders the waveform and allows for creating new markers that were not present
in the source wav file.
</li><li> Stingers - Voice States can now have "stingers" specified that will play when a set of conditions are met.
</li><li> Voices can now disable their "Completion" transition, preventing them from being destroyed when their
layers are complete (another transition must be executed in order to end the voice)
</li><li> Signal transitions have been added - allowing transitions other than "stop" and "completion" between states. Transitions
are executed when the controller on them is greater than zero.
</li><li> [Studio] Game Controllers that are referenced by the selected event or any bus on the primary output route now have their
preview sliders displayed above the default routing for the event.
</li><li> [Studio] Rendering projects now stages stream writes in a memory buffer to decrease total seek count.
</li></ul>

<h2><span><b> 10.0.16 - May 14, 2017</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li> State Based Voices - Voices can now maintain an active state, with transitions. This initial release is sparse on

That means you can now use Ogg, even if you have LGPL restrictions - this is 100% RAD source code. Even better, our decoder is natively
SIMD - it supports SSE, Xbox 360 VMX, PS3 VMX, PS2 VU0 and Wii packed singles - it is the fastest Ogg decoder available (almost twice as
fast as libVorbis, and faster than any other SIMD implementation as well). It also uses quite a bit less runtime memory. Ogg is now
our recommended compressed format (over MP3).</li><li>Added the new AIL_set_sample_speaker_scale_factors function that lets you modulate the final volume on a speaker by speaker
basis in both 2D and 3D mode. You usually want to use AIL_set_sample_channel_levels to <i>select</i> which input channel goes to what speaker
and use AIL_set_sample_speaker_factors to <i>modulate</i> the volume scaling.</li><li>Added the new AIL_set_sample_is_3D function to flip a sample handle into or, more commonly, back out of 3D spacializing mode.</li><li>Mono sounds in 2D mode on multi-channel output now play to the front left and right channels (not every channel as before).</li><li>On Wii, switch to our own stack buffer during callback and timer time.</li><li>You can now set low pass and DSP filter settings on an input channel basis (you can set different settings for the left
vs. the right channel, for example. This changed a few of the filter properties, and changed the AIL_sample_stage_property and
AIL_set_sample_low_pass_cut function parameters.</li><li>Removed the DIG_PCM_ORDER flag, since you can better control speaker placement with the AIL_set_channel_levels function.</li><li>Removed the final parameter from AIL_init_sample, since there is no DIG_PCM_ORDER flag.</li><li>Fixed several minor issues with the built-in lowpass/occlusion filter.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when using 8.1-channel and 6.1-channel output formats.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could cause a crash with the Delay filter under EAX/DirectSound3D.</li><li>MAKELOOP.EXE is now compatible with LAME 3.98.

<ul><li>Multichannel Ogg Vorbis files are now fully supported by the MSS API. They may be played with either AIL_open_stream or AIL_set_named_sample_file.</li><li>Multichannel (WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE) PCM .WAV files are now supported via AIL_set_named_sample_file.</li><li>The Miles Sound Player now supports multichannel .WAV and Ogg Vorbis files.</li><li>Added new WavMux.exe command-line utility to create multichannel .WAV files which may be played directly as static
HSAMPLES or converted to multichannel Ogg Vorbis files, e.g., with the free OggDrop encoder, for either static playback
or streaming.</li><li>Extensive simplifications made to FAQ `How do I use multi-channel sound output in Miles?` Specifically, the new
MSS_SPEAKER enum type eliminates all channel-count dependencies in level-control function calls.</li><li>Several API functions related to per-channel level control have been changed to accommodate multichannel
source support using the new MSS_SPEAKER type, and are now more programmer-friendly as well. These functions include AIL_set_sample_channel_levels,
AIL_sample_channel_levels, AIL_set_speaker_reverb_levels, AIL_speaker_reverb_levels, and AIL_calculate_3D_channel_levels.</li><li>Added AIL_sample_channel_count function to return the channel width (1=mono, 2=stereo, &gt;2=multichannel) of the specified HSAMPLE.</li><li>Added AIL_sample_output_levels function to return the final amplitude scale factor applied by the MSS mixer to any given HSAMPLE. This
takes all scaling sources into account, including 3D distance and cone functions (both default and user-supplied), AIL_set_sample_channel_levels,
and the various volume/pan functions.</li><li>AIL_init_sample's return type has been changed from void to S32. See the function description for details.</li><li>The AILSOUNDINFO structure now includes a 32-bit channel_mask member which can be used to specify gaps in the default (WDM-based) channel order for
multichannel samples.</li><li>Added AIL_set_sample_buffer_count and AIL_sample_buffer_count to allow the application to determine the number of buffers used for low-level streaming. Changed AIL_sample_buffer_ready to AIL_sample_buffer_available,
and modified the parameters of AIL_sample_buffer_info. If your application uses these low-level streaming functions, you should carefully review the function descriptions and the dbtest.cpp example when upgrading to this version of MSS.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could cause lockups when calling AIL_close_digital_driver after unplugging headphones on certain Windows systems.</li><li>Added WIN32_POSITION_ERR property for AIL_platform_property function to allow the application to detect removal of headphones, speakers, or other sound hardware at runtime.</li><li>AIL_set_sample_51_volume_pan and AIL_set_sample_51_volume_levels now establish consistent front/back and left-right levels for all output modes, not just 5.1 modes.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could cause audible artifacts when using software DSP filters (including the built-in LPF) with EAX/DirectSound3D providers</li><li>Fixed a memory leak in the Xbox 360 implementation of AIL_close_digital_driver.</li><li>Cleaned up some IO error handling code on the Wii.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Wii init code that was causing the digital latency to be too high.</li><li>Removed 500 ms of silence at the front of the `coolmidi` sample MIDI file.</li><li>Lowered the DLS synthesizer startup latency.</li><li>Fixed a (typically-harmless) bug in AIL_filter_DLS_with_XMI that could truncate the output file by 8 bytes.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 7.0x to 7.1a (06-25-2007)"><b>Changes from 7.0x to 7.1a (06-25-2007)</b></a></b></span></h2>

<ul><li>Changed the default falloff power for multichannel positioning from 1.0 to 3.0.
You may wish to review the AIL_set_speaker_configuration function to understand how this change
affects the behavior of the MSS 3D positioner.</li><li>The AIL_set_sample_channel_levels function can now be used to modify the channel levels established by the
3D positioner. In previous versions, this function had no effect on 3D-positioned HSAMPLEs and HSTREAMs.</li><li>It is now possible to apply 3D positioning to stereo files. 3D-positioned stereo sources will be downmixed to
mono. Previous versions of MSS did not support 3D positioning of stereo sources.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could cause truncated playback of extremely-short XMA samples.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could cause XMA samples to fail to begin playing under certain conditions.</li><li>Fixed a bug that caused the auto_3D_wet_atten parameter for AIL_set_sample_3D_distances to be ignored for sounds beyond the

<ul><li>Added an Intel Mac version of Miles. This platform has all the features of the Windows version,
including identical performance. The performance is identical because rather than port all of our assembly,
we instead wrote a DLL loader and load the Windows RIB DLLs on MacOS!</li><li>Fixed a too-conservative locking situation in the streaming API that would cause one of the
disc buffers to not preload with MP3 or Ogg data. So, even if you called AIL_service_stream to fill
the internal buffers, when you began playback, you could stall while a disk seek happened.</li><li>Tweaked the streaming API to not lock the mixer mutex while IO is running, so that if you
take a large IO hit on a background stream thread, then normal in-memory and other well-cached
streams won't skip.</li><li>Fixed a silly bug on the PS3 where a thread handle was leaked for each stream that was played.</li><li>Fixed a crash bug in the AIL_quick_load_mem function.</li><li>Split the definitions of the driver properties and sample properties. This will require
a few changes on the application side if you are using DSP filters or EAX preferences. Usually,
you will simply have to change enums like DP_FILTER_0 to SP_FILTER_0.</li><li>Removed the C runtime from most of the RIB DLLs (so they can be used on MacOS) which had
the side effect of shrinking most of the binary files by 20 to 60K.</li><li>Removed the Ogg encode routines from the function tables which shrunk the Ogg decoder's
code footprint in half.</li><li>Moved the multi-channel copy and the adpcm decompressor over to a separate mixer module.
On Intel Mac, this module is separate (mssmixer.mix), but on all other platforms, it remains
built-in to the Miles library directly. This moved a fair amount of code around.</li><li>Build with better switches on MacOS PPC, so fewer internal functions are exported.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 7.0p to 7.0q (8-21-2006)"><b>Changes from 7.0p to 7.0q (8-21-2006)</b></a></b></span></h2>

multiple DirectSound3D/EAX sounds were playing.</li><li>Fixed bug introduced with remnant-buffer optimization that could cause clicking
when resampling compressed data.</li><li>Made some preliminary changes and additions for upcoming Ogg Speex support.</li><li>Added new All-Pass Filter, intended primarily for experimental use in phase-domain effects.</li><li>Added AIL_register_falloff_function_callback to allow

<ul><li>Released final Miles 7.0 for MacOS! New to this platform is a Carbon Mach-O
version of the library, so you can now use Miles
with XCode and GCC. Support for Intel Macs coming soon.</li><li>Changed the mixer slightly to avoid 1-sample remnant buffers - sped up mixing
of compressed formats very slightly.</li><li>Removed a dependency on a newer-than-necessary XMA library on the Xbox 360.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 7.0j to 7.0k (4-18-2006)"><b>Changes from 7.0j to 7.0k (4-18-2006)</b></a></b></span></h2>

<ul><li>Added optional Ogg Vorbis support! This new ASI decoder requires signing a special separate license with RAD before you
can download it. It's available for all Miles platforms and is completely integrated into Miles. It uses a bit more CPU than
MP3 and doesn't quite loop as well, but is a good option when you need low bit-rates.</li><li>Added DTS multi-channel output on the PS/2. This is a great-sounding output layer that takes very little CPU. Perfect
for supporting PS/2s that are hooked up to home theaters. You must obtain permission from DTS before you can link with this
output layer. Recommended for all PS2 developers.</li><li>Lots and lots and lots of internal changes to support the upcoming Windows 64-bit version of Miles.</li><li>Merged RIB attributes and preferences into a new concept called properties. There is now just
one function to both retrieve and set properties, and properties are retrieved into a memory buffer instead
of on the return stack. This means if you are setting filter preferences, then you will have to make a few
simple code changes. Larger changes are necessary if you are interfacing directly to RIB plugins (or you have written your own);
contact us for details on this change.</li><li>Big changes to the EAX 4 properties. You now set a particular EAX4 effect onto a slot directly (instead of the other way
around). This is more consistent with what the hardware is doing and makes for a better API. If you have a lot of EAX 4 code,
contact us and we'll help you update.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the low-pass filter cut off was based on the hardware DMA output rate instead of the sample rate.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Xbox hardware low-pass filter wasn't being applied until the sound moved.</li><li>Fixed some occasional clicks when restarting a sample or rapidly changing the volume of a compressed digital sample.</li><li>Fixed a crash in Miles Sound Player with large compressed files.</li><li>OUTPUT_BIT_RATE property is now reported correctly by Voxware codecs.</li><li>Fixed a timer wraparound bug where the CPU usage would be measured incorrectly every 70 minutes.</li><li>Fixed the PS/2 file handle support, so that you can just pass in a file handle instead of a RAD_IOP_ASYNC_OPEN_DATA structure.</li><li>Built the Xbox 360 version with the April XDK (works with XDKs back to February).</li><li>Added new Gain Block Filter for generalized linear gain/nonlinear distortion effects.</li><li>PS2 and Xenon examples now start sounds at their intended 3D positions.</li><li>Fixed occasional trailing glitches when playing certain streams through hardware 3D voice filters on Win32 version.</li><li>AIL_mem_free_lock can now be used safely from within background callbacks on the PS2.

undersampled (pitch-up) rates.</li><li>Reduced zipper noise when changing parameters in certain filters (such as Parametric EQ).</li><li>Added `Mix` preference and attribute to all filters except Volume Ramp and Capture. This parameter ranges
from 0.0 to 1.0, and determines the filter's degree of contribution to its own output signal. You can bypass a
filter's effect altogether by setting its `Mix` parameter to 0.0. This will reduce the filter's CPU load
significantly when the filter is not needed, while allowing its effect to be turned back on later without adding
artifacts associated with filter initialization. <i>Note that all filters with existing wet/dry mix parameters

our software multichannel provider for more voices and maximum consistency, or use EAX/DirectSound3D for hardware-accelerated effects.</li><li>DSP filters may now be stacked up to eight levels deep. AIL_filter_sample_attribute and AIL_set_filter_sample_preference have
been deprecated in favor of AIL_sample_stage_attribute and AIL_set_sample_stage_preference, respectively. These functions take a
constant from DP_FILTER_0 (formerly the only available per-sample filter slot) to DP_FILTER_7 (the last of eight available slots in
the new version).</li><li>Added two new classes of filters. 'Matrix' filters perform postmix processing for output formats such as Dolby Surround
and SRS Circle Surround. 'Voice' filters actually replace the Miles mixer itself, performing their own hardware buffer management
on a per-voice basis. All of the EAX/DirectSound3D functionality previously implemented in M3D providers is now based on voice filters.
Both matrix- and voice-output filters are installed automatically when AIL_open_digital_driver is called with the appropriate enum value from
MSS_MC_SPEC.</li><li>All platforms, including Xbox and DOS, now support DSP filters.</li><li>New digital audio loop editor added to Miles Sound Player lets you generate seamless loops <i>even within MP3 files!</i></li><li>Added support for SRS Circle Surround(R).

is now set correctly, sample pipeline filters are now supported, SSE support has been disabled for DOS extender compatibility,
and ASIFILE works correctly with MP3 decoder)</li><li>Miles Fast 2D provider moved into core library. (All drivers offer 3D distance/directional attenuation now, enabled by
calling AIL_set_sample_3D_position on an HSAMPLE.)</li><li>MP3 frame headers are now checked for consistency against the most recent valid frame, rather than the first frame in the file (which
may have been corrupted or incorrectly-detected).</li><li>Added a frame-level MP3 disassembly utility to the Miles Sound Studio.
The disassembler is accessed via the File Info button (formerly File Type).</li><li>Added frame-level MP3 inspection to the API via the AIL_inspect_MP3 and AIL_enumerate_MP3_frames functions.</li><li>ID3v2 tags in the middle of an MP3 file are now handled properly.</li><li>MP3 frames with insufficient data now generate silence rather than simply being skipped (improves robustness in subblock loops).</li><li>Accumulated MP3 output data (and its associated filter state) is no longer discarded during looping (only during normal seek
operations, e.g., in response to AIL_set_sample_position).</li><li>Removed external reverb filters. The core library's reverb implementation offers a superset of the removed filters' functionality.</li><li>Removed Lagrangian resampling filter (not competitive with internal resampler).</li><li>Made several changes to the internal API for pipeline filter providers to support multichannel build buffers and
postmix processors. Third-party FLT providers will need to be revised for use with MSS 7. Added inline helper functions to
imssapi.h for ease of maintenance.</li><li>Always perform predelay calculations to position the reverb tail pointer correctly, even when wet level is zero.</li><li>Doppler calculations now use cosine scaling to discriminate against sources moving perpendicular to source-listener axis.</li><li>Removed EAX 1 support, due to EAX 1's lack of standardization, feature-poor control API, buggy OEM drivers, and the widespread presence of
EAX 2-compatible hardware. All EAX 1 applications should migrate to EAX 2 or (preferably) discrete software-mixing configurations.</li><li>Fixed various bugs in the EAX providers, including an array-overflow bug in EAX 4 and incorrect 3D auto-attenuation flag control
in EAX 2/3. Significant changes were made to the way occlusion, obstruction, and exclusion are applied to dry and wet levels in the
various providers, with the goal of harmonizing their behavior across providers to the greatest extent possible.
Some preferences such as EAX_REVERBMIX are now under API control, and were removed. This means that EAX applications optimized for
use with Miles 6 may need to be re-tweaked when upgrading to Miles 7!</li><li>Added auto_3D_wet_atten parameter to AIL_set_sample_3D_distances.</li><li>For improved compatibility with certain streaming applications, AIL_load_sample_buffer no longer automatically starts
playback. You must call AIL_start_sample yourself, after submitting either one or two valid buffers. (AIL_start_sample no
longer restarts playback of double-buffered samples that are already playing, so there's no need to check
the sample's playback status when calling AIL_start_sample after AIL_load_sample_buffer.)</li><li>Removed AIL_set_sample_type and moved its parameters to AIL_init_sample. It is no longer necessary to call AIL_init_sample
prior to AIL_set_sample_file, AIL_set_named_sample_file, or AIL_set_sample_info.</li><li>Removed the AIL_allocate_file_sample and AIL_register_EOF_callback functions. Use AIL_set_sample_file or AIL_set_named_sample_file instead.</li><li>Removed the (previously-deprecated) AIL_waveOutOpen function. Use AIL_open_digital_driver instead.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could cause AIL_open_digital_driver or AIL_waveOutOpen to fail when using waveOut.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could cause a short glitch when restarting playback of an MP3 file.</li><li>We no longer allow a sample's state to reach SMP_DONE if an ASI decoder still has some data in its output buffer. This fixes a
bug that could cause the last few kilobytes of output data from an MP3-based sample or stream to be lost.</li><li>Two Win32-specific preferences, DIG_PREFERRED_WO_DEVICE and DIG_PREFERRED_DS_DEVICE, have been added to force
AIL_open_digital_driver to use a specific waveOut device ID or DirectSound LPGUID. These preferences take the place of the
dwDeviceID parameter in AIL_waveOutOpen. Most applications should leave these preferences at their default values of
WAVE_MAPPER and NULL, respectively.</li><li>Added a new preference, DIG_LEVEL_RAMP_SAMPLES, which determines the number of samples over which volume level changes will be ramped in
at each software-mixing interval. With this feature, all software-mixed platforms will experience significantly less unwanted
clicking and `zipper noise` during changes to volume control levels and 3D positions.</li><li>Fixed a bug which could introduce clicking artifacts on samples whose playback rates are
swept through unity. This fix improves Doppler-effect quality significantly in some cases.</li><li>Renamed AIL_set_3D_room_type and AIL_3D_room_type to AIL_set_room_type and AIL_room_type, respectively. AIL_set_digital_master_room_type
has been removed. The room-type functions
are now available even for samples that aren't undergoing 3D positioning by MSS.</li><li>Likewise, AIL_set_3D_sample_occlusion,
AIL_set_3D_sample_obstruction, AIL_set_3D_sample_exclusion, AIL_3D_sample_occlusion, AIL_3D_sample_obstruction, and
AIL_3D_sample_exclusion have been renamed to
AIL_set_sample_occlusion, AIL_set_sample_obstruction, AIL_set_sample_exclusion, AIL_sample_occlusion, AIL_sample_obstruction,
and AIL_sample_exclusion.</li><li>Removed the concept of the 3D HPROVIDER from the API. The functions AIL_set_3D_distance_factor, AIL_set_3D_doppler_factor,
AIL_set_3D_rolloff_factor, AIL_set_room_type, AIL_3D_distance_factor, AIL_3D_doppler_factor, AIL_3D_rolloff_factor,
and AIL_room_type now take an HDIGDRIVER rather than an HPROVIDER. AIL_enumerate_3D_providers, AIL_enumerate_3D_provider_attributes,
AIL_set_3D_provider_preference, AIL_3D_provider_attribute, AIL_find_3D_provider, AIL_open_3D_provider, and AIL_close_3D_provider have been removed.</li><li>Removed the AIL_set_3D_speaker_type function and the MILES_SPEAKER_TYPE definitions. Speaker types are either specified by the end user
via their Windows control panel or OEM configuration applet, or are implicit in the MSS channel specification passed to AIL_open_digital_driver
(e.g., MSS_MC_51_DISCRETE or MSS_MC_STEREO).</li><li>Removed the H3DSAMPLE type from the API. Most functions that formerly operated on H3DSAMPLEs were removed, including
AIL_3D_sample_attribute, AIL_3D_sample_length, AIL_3D_sample_loop_count, AIL_3D_sample_offset, AIL_3D_sample_playback_rate,
AIL_3D_sample_status, AIL_3D_sample_volume, AIL_allocate_3D_sample_handle, AIL_end_3D_sample, AIL_register_3D_EOS_callback,
AIL_release_3D_sample_handle, AIL_resume_3D_sample, AIL_set_3D_sample_info, AIL_set_3D_sample_loop_block, AIL_set_3D_sample_loop_count,
AIL_set_3D_sample_offset, AIL_set_3D_sample_playback_rate, AIL_set_3D_sample_preference, AIL_set_3D_sample_volume, AIL_start_3D_sample,
and AIL_stop_3D_sample.</li><li>Removed AIL_active_3D_sample_count.</li><li>Removed the H3DPOBJECT type, as well as the AIL_auto_update_3D_position, AIL_open_3D_listener,
AIL_close_3D_listener, AIL_open_3D_object, AIL_close_3D_object, AIL_3D_user_data, and AIL_set_3D_user_data functions.
The remaining functions which took H3DPOBJECTs, including AIL_3D_orientation, AIL_3D_position, AIL_3D_velocity,
AIL_set_3D_orientation, AIL_set_3D_position, AIL_update_3D_position, AIL_set_3D_velocity,
and AIL_set_3D_velocity_vector have been replaced with versions
specific to HSAMPLEs
(AIL_sample_3D_orientation, AIL_sample_3D_position, AIL_sample_3D_velocity,
AIL_set_sample_3D_orientation, AIL_set_sample_3D_position, AIL_set_sample_3D_velocity, AIL_set_sample_3D_velocity_vector) and
HDIGDRIVERs
(AIL_listener_3D_orientation, AIL_listener_3D_position, AIL_listener_3D_velocity,
AIL_set_listener_3D_orientation, AIL_set_listener_3D_position, AIL_update_listener_3D_position, AIL_set_listener_3D_velocity,
AIL_set_listener_3D_velocity_vector).</li><li>Renamed the remaining AIL_3D_sample...() / AIL_set_3D_sample...() functions to AIL_sample_3D...() / AIL_set_sample_3D...() to reflect
the fact that 3D positioning is now just another property of an HSAMPLE, rather than a feature implemented by a separate '3D sample' type.
The newly-renamed functions are AIL_set_sample_3D_distances, AIL_sample_3D_distances, AIL_set_sample_3D_cone, AIL_sample_3D_cone,
AIL_set_sample_3D_position, AIL_set_sample_3D_velocity, AIL_set_sample_3D_velocity_vector, AIL_set_sample_3D_orientation,
AIL_sample_3D_position, AIL_sample_3D_velocity, AIL_sample_3D_orientation, and AIL_update_sample_3D_position. <i>Note that an
HSAMPLE's 3D properties are ignored by MSS until the application requests 3D positioning support by calling AIL_set_3D_position!</i> Once
enabled for a given HSAMPLE, 3D positioning can be disabled by releasing and reallocating the HSAMPLE, or by calling AIL_init_sample,
AIL_set_sample_file, AIL_set_named_sample_file, or AIL_set_sample_info.</li><li>Removed AIL_3D_sample_effects_level and AIL_set_3D_sample_effects_level. Reverb effects for all
samples (whether or not they're 3D-positioned) are now controlled by AIL_set_sample_reverb_levels. Note that the per-sample wet mix
defaults to 0.0, so at least one call to AIL_set_sample_reverb_levels is mandatory before you'll be able to hear any reverb/room effects
on any given sample.</li><li>Added AIL_DLS_sample_handle and AIL_stream_sample_handle functions to allow access to the HSAMPLE associated internally with an
HDLSDEVICE or HSTREAM. This allowed us to remove AIL_DLS_set_reverb_levels, AIL_DLS_get_reverb_levels, AIL_stream_reverb_levels,
AIL_set_stream_reverb_levels, AIL_DLS_processor, AIL_set_DLS_processor, AIL_stream_processor, AIL_set_stream_processor,
AIL_stream_playback_rate, AIL_set_stream_playback_rate, AIL_set_stream_low_pass_cut_off, AIL_stream_low_pass_cut_off,
AIL_set_stream_volume_pan, AIL_stream_volume_pan, AIL_filter_stream_attribute, AIL_set_filter_stream_preference,
AIL_filter_DLS_attribute, and AIL_set_filter_DLS_preference.</li><li>Added AIL_set_speaker_configuration and AIL_speaker_configuration.</li><li>Added AIL_set_listener_relative_receiver_array and AIL_listener_relative_receiver_array. These functions are reserved for future use,
and are undocumented at present.</li><li>Added AIL_set_speaker_reverb_response and AIL_speaker_reverb_response.</li><li>Added AIL_set_sample_channel_levels and AIL_sample_channel_levels.</li><li>Added AIL_digital_output_filter, AIL_enumerate_output_filter_driver_attributes,
AIL_output_filter_driver_attribute, AIL_set_output_filter_driver_preference, AIL_enumerate_output_filter_sample_attributes,
and AIL_enumerate_sample_stage_attributes. (Note that sample-level attribute and preference values for voice output filters may be accessed
by specifying DP_OUTPUT in calls to AIL_sample_stage_attribute and AIL_set_sample_stage_preference. Matrix output filters do not support
per-sample attributes and preferences.)</li><li>AIL_open_filter now returns -1 (rather than 0) if the filter HPROVIDER was already
associated with the specified HDIGDRIVER.</li><li>Release candidate for version 7 on Windows and Xbox.</li><li>Major speed optimizations over version 7.0a - 300% faster multichannel mixing, 200% faster DSP effects.</li><li>Xbox can play now 3D audio on a 2D digital driver by using the pan and volume spacialization code from Win32. This
means you are no longer restricted to the Xbox's 64 3D audio voices.</li><li>Xbox can now use the Miles software DSP filters. The only restriction is that you can't apply the software DSP filters
to Xbox ADPCM voices (since the hardware decompresses them).</li><li>Renamed the AIL_speaker_reverb_response to AIL_speaker_reverb_levels - this function now allows you to set the master
volume level for both wet <b>and</b> dry, so you can use it to set balance levels of each speaker.</li><li>Replaced the mono/stereo delay filters with a single unified delay filter that can serve both purposes.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 6.6h to 7.0a (5-16-2005)"><b>Changes from 6.6h to 7.0a (5-16-2005)</b></a></b></span></h2>

<ul><li>Added a new DSP filter to allow you to smoothly ramp up or down volume over time. You can ramp your volumes on a sample by sample basis over any length of time with 3 lines of code. Also added a FAQ explaining how to use this new filter.</li><li>Added a new utility function, AIL_find_filter, to quickly and easily locate a filter by name. This just saves you
from having to do the enumeration yourself.</li><li>Added another utility function, AIL_find_3D_provider, to quickly and easily locate a 3D provider by name. Like AIL_find_filter, this just saves you from having to do the enumeration yourself.</li><li>Optimized the AIL_set_3D_sample_data functions so that a DirectSound buffer is only reallocated if the sound format has changed. This can double the speed of these common functions on most hardware.</li><li>If the format of a sound buffer didn't change in AIL_set_3D_sample_data, then we no longer reset the position, orientation, volume, etc. of the 3D sample. We no longer do this because you will usually immediately change these settings anyway, and it makes a big difference in setup time. If you were previously relying on the settings to be cleared, then you can clear them by hand, or you can release and then reallocate the 3D handle.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the DirectSound hardware 3D providers where you could allocate one more 3D sound handle than the hardware could play. No sound would ever play on this handle, so you could unknowingly have had sounds that were never being played. Due to this fix, you may want to double check your AIL_allocate_3D_sample_handle logic to make sure it can handle a null return value (which will now happen if you exceed the sound card's internal buffer limit).</li><li>Fixed a bug in the upsampling filter (on PC and Mac) that caused clipping. This would also affect the Miles Fast 2D providers as well.</li><li>Fixed a bug when using the upsampling filter on ACPCM or MP3 compressed data where one sample at the end of each decompressed buffer might be skipped (this causes a periodic clicking at very slow playback rates).</li><li>Clear the previous sample filter values whenever you restart a sample playback (to avoid a click from the filter if you previously stopped it in the middle of a sound).</li><li>We now exclude disabled top level windows in our automatic HWND detection code (DirectSound requires an HWND) - this avoids occasionally identifying hidden application message windows.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 6.6e to 6.6f (10-31-2004)"><b>Changes from 6.6e to 6.6f (10-31-2004)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Tweaked the Audigy bug handling and detection again (sigh).</li><li>Added AIL_set_sample_info to the 2D digital sound system to be orthogonal to the 3D AIL_set_3D_sample_info function.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the MP3 decoder DLL could crash if it was unloaded twice (if there were two copies of the DLLs accidentally loaded).</li><li>We no longer reload the RIBs when you specify `.` for the redistribution path.</li><li>We no longer auto-register AIL_shutdown to be called in the application's atexit handler. This was convenient but caused too many wacky linker bugs. You have to do this yourself, if you want this behavior now.</li><li>Fixed AIL_stream_position to be much more accurate (added thread protection) and to give accurate values around loop points.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the streaming system where if you jumped to the end of an ADPCM sound image, then we would pad out the buffer even though we
never read the unpadded final ADPCM block. This would cause looping ADPCM streams to play garbage if you seeked off the end.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the DirectSound code where, if you cranked up the DIG_DS_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT preference to maximum, then you could overwrite the
play cursor which would cause sound glitching.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 6.6d to 6.6e (10-23-2004)"><b>Changes from 6.6d to 6.6e (10-23-2004)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Added some code to work around yet another Creative Labs driver bug. This Audigy 2 driver bug is identical to the SBLive
bug from several years ago - after ten hours or so of looping, a DirectSound buffer will suddenly stop reporting buffer position changes. We
now watch for any time positions stop changing for longer than 128 ms, and upon this unhappy event, we reset the buffer. This gives a little
click of sound (once every ten hours), but at least the audio continues playing.</li><li>Changed some logic to allow streams to be closed inside an end of stream callback (which we don't really recommend anyway).</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 6.6c to 6.6d (08-17-2004)"><b>Changes from 6.6c to 6.6d (08-17-2004)</b></a></b></span></h2>

<ul><li>Major optimizations on the MP3 decoder - added SSE support and did lots of memory and code generation tweaks to improve playback speed. On P4s, MP3 decompression is 1.9 times as fast. On P3s, we are 1.7 times as fast. The fastest MP3 decoder is now almost twice as fast!</li><li>Fixed MP3 files with ID3 tags being clipped off at the end.</li><li>Fixed AIL_quick_unload to avoid a crash on fast machines when closing a MIDI with DLS sample.</li><li>Made streaming playback begin immediately in AIL_start_stream, instead of the next time the background thread executed.</li><li>Fixed a bug when pausing and resuming when using the low-level stream APIs where the playback would never unpause.

being incorrectly returned.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the debug log could sometimes get truncated.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 6.1c to 6.5a (05-30-2002)"><b>Changes from 6.1c to 6.5a (05-30-2002)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Moved the software EAX reverb engine directly into the Miles mixer
and massively optimized it. You can now add global reverb for essentially
no CPU hit at all (0.25% - one forth of one percent) per sample! Since it
is built into the mixer, you can add software EAX reverb on digital
streams or the DLS songs as well.</li><li>Moved the low-pass filter into the Miles mixer and did massive
optimizations. You can now use low-pass filtering for about 0.33% (one
third of one percent) per sample.</li><li>Merged the digital volume and pan functions and made them accept float
values that are linear in loudness (not amplitude). That means that 0.5 is
10 dB down (vs. 6 dB in a linear amplitude system). The pan is now a
power pan compatible with DLS - the left and right levels are adjusted to
give a balanced total volume as the panned sample moves from one speaker to
the other.</li><li>Added direct volume level functions that accept a specific float level
for the left and right speakers from 0.0 to 1.0. These direct volume
functions are linear in amplitude space (0.5 is 6 dB down).</li><li>Added a new Creative EAX 3 provider (Thanks Carlo).</li><li>Added support for exclusion (a new EAX 3 setting) control in all of
the providers (emulated where necessary) and at the API level.</li><li>Added a new Dolby Surround DSP filter. You can now set the front to
back pan level on Dolby Surround speaker systems on samples, streams or DLS
songs.</li><li>Added new 5.1 and 7.1 speaker system flags. Fixed the default mode
of the DirectSound3D providers always using 2-speakers.</li><li>Don't perform mixing at all on samples whose volumes are zero -
speeds up the 3D providers when the 3D sample is beyond the maximum
distance.</li><li>Mix twice as far on emulated DirectSound drivers to smooth skipping
problems.</li><li>When automatically choosing between DirectSound and waveOut, if
emulated DirectSound works, but waveOut doesn't work, then flip back to
emulated DirectSound even though it may skip.</li><li>Added a time-out in the waveOut support so buggy drivers don't lock up
Miles.</li><li>Merged all of the digital filters into one DLL instead of 18
(smaller and faster to load - not to mention 17 fewer files in the
redistribution directory).</li><li>Merged all of the EAX 3D providers into one DLL, all of the A3D
providers into one DLL, all of the DirectSound3D providers into one DLL, all
of the DirectX 7 3D providers into one DLL and all of the Miles software
providers into one DLL (again this is smaller and faster to load).</li><li>Fixed a bug in the DLS synthesizer where songs could overrun after a
certain length of time (leading to small pops).</li><li>Fixed a bug in the DLS synthesizer where notes played exactly on
frequency could be dropped.</li><li>Switched to using a new voice re-allocation strategy in the DLS synthesizer when
running out of voices.</li><li>Changed the envelope shaping in the DLS synthesizer to be linear in
amplitude space (vs. the seemingly more correct linear in dB).</li><li>Upped the simultaneously voices in the DLS synthesizer from 24 to
32.</li><li>Fixed a small memory leak in the 3D system when a provider fails to
open another 3D sample (Thanks Jeff).</li><li>Fixed a bug where using the non-async file reading callbacks where
they could be called at interrupt time on MacOS
and DOS (leading to a crash) (Thanks John).</li><li>Fixed a bug where requesting the length of a quick audio handle
could cause the next audio handle to prematurely end.</li><li>Fixed a steathly bug where playing a non-MP3 stream directly after
an MP3 stream at exactly the right moment could cause a crash (Thanks James).</li><li>Fixed a goofy bug in the ASIFile example where the files were being
converted only 4 bytes at a time.</li><li>Dropped Win32s support (Win32 on Win16).</li><li>Switched to not calling GlobalLock on Win32 to support some memory
debugging systems.</li><li>Added the `Mute at max` preference to the Miles software 3D
providers and the DirectSound 3D based providers. This allows you to
control whether sounds are muted at the maximum distance (the default) or
just stop fading out at the maximum distance.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 6.1b to 6.1c (10-15-2001)"><b>Changes from 6.1b to 6.1c (10-15-2001)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Added the new 3D functions: AIL_set_3D_rolloff_factor,
AIL_set_3D_doppler_factor, and AIL_set_3D_distance_factor.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the DLS synth where MIDI notes could sometimes get
shut off when a song looped.</li><li>Added support for MP3 files with ID3 v2 headers. ID3 v2
headers can be up to 64K, so you will usually want to avoid them for space
considerations.</li><li>Fixed a subtle bug in the PC downsampling mixers, where the audio could be
quite noisy and crackly when downsampling by very small factors.</li><li>Made optimizations to the PC ADPCM and 8-bit sound mixers.</li><li>Added a workaround in the PC Miles timer code for buggy motherboards
that advance the QueryPerformanceCounter incorrectly under heavy
loads. Also added a check to prevent the timer from ever running backwards.</li><li>Fixed a bug in PC Miles where you couldn't restart Miles with the
quick API.</li><li>Fixed a bug where AIL_quick_ms_length wouldn't return the correct
length unless the sound was playing.</li><li>Added a few changes to the RIB subsystem so that RIBs are reference
counted.</li><li>Used the special exception code on NT to label the Miles background
threads (easier to see what threads belong to Miles).</li><li>Fixed a bug in the PC timer code where if you released a timer
inside a timer callback, the callback might be called again.</li><li>Fixed a bug when playing waveOut audio on NT4 with an SBLive where
the sound would skip and stutter.</li><li>Fixed a bug when playing waveOut audio and you released and then
reacquired the digital sound handle.</li><li>Added support for overriding the Miles memory allocation routines
under Win32.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Miles Sound Studio would crash on a MIDI or
DLS Dump.</li><li>Fixed a crash bug in the RSX provider when shutting down while
running on waveOut drivers.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 6.1a to 6.1b (09-06-2001)"><b>Changes from 6.1a to 6.1b (09-06-2001)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Mac MP3 decoder has been completely rewritten in PPC assembly. It

<ul><li>First official MacOS version! PC and Mac versions fully synched.</li><li>All new sound mixers - in some cases up to 3 times faster! Also
includes much higher quality resamplers (fully linearly interpolated vs. approximate).</li><li>Fixed crash when running under waveOut.</li><li>More tolerant of bad MP3 data (keep playing whenever possible and
fewer potential crashes).</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Miles Fast 2D and Dolby Surround providers where
some samples beyond the maximum distance never finish playing.</li><li>Added the AIL_set_async_file_callbacks function. This allows you to replace the
file IO functions used by the streaming API using asynchronous IO (usually
only used on MacOS or Win NT).</li><li>Plain MP3 files inside of a packed file can now be opened by the streaming API without
having to wrap a wave header around the data. To do this, pass in the file
handle as you would normally do only now add a comma, followed by the length of
the MP3 data. For example, if you wanted to stream out of file handle 5,
for 32768 bytes, use `\\\\5,32768`.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the voice chat client example where the application
could crash on opening.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the exporting of the AIL_update_3D_position and
AIL_auto_update_3D_position functions.</li><li>Miles no longer includes pre-built 16-bit Windows DLLs - they must be built
on the developer's machine (mainly because the 16-bit Microsoft C compiler doesn't
work on my Win2K machine any longer).</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 6.0k to 6.0m (11-12-2000)"><b>Changes from 6.0k to 6.0m (11-12-2000)</b></a></b></span></h2>

AIL_open_XMIDI_driver/AIL_close_XMIDI_driver functions. These
functions work on all Miles platforms and should now be used instead of
AIL_waveOut* and AIL_midiOut* which were Windows-only and are now deprecated.</li><li>Miles now allows all ASI formats to wrapped in a wave file. Each
ASI exports a wave format tag that tells Miles what ASI decoder to use.</li><li>Renamed the AIL_DLL_verion function to AIL_MSS_version.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 6.0J to 6.0k (10-22-2000)"><b>Changes from 6.0J to 6.0k (10-22-2000)</b></a></b></span></h2>

multiple times while streams are playing.</li><li>Fixed a crash in the mono delay, stereo delay and reverb 1 filters where
memory was freed out of order.</li><li>Fixed a granularity problem when seeking with milliseconds in an
uncompressed sound stream.</li><li>Fixed the sub-block looping on streams to allow -1 for the end of the
stream.</li><li>Limited waveOut latency to more reasonable maximum values - should have much
lower latency on NT 4 with newer sound cards.</li><li>Renamed the internal STREAM_TYPE structure to avoid collisions in the
MMSYSTEM.H Windows header file.</li><li>Added the new function RIB_find_files_provider which allows you to search

exhausting the IO bandwidth of the streaming device.</li><li>Force call to AIL_shutdown from an atexit handler to insure Miles is
always closed.</li><li>Lock far fewer Miles functions for better performance on multiple CPU

number to lessen the chance of possible conflicts.</li><li>Fixed the Miles Sound Studio occasionally using the voice chat encoder
instead of the MP3 encoder.</li><li>Switched to a new threading model that should be more robust with poor
sound card drivers and other libraries that use DirectSound concurrently
with Miles (you shouldn't have to call AIL_lock anymore). The new
threading model can be turned on and off with the new
AIL_MUTEX_PROTECTION preference (default is on).</li><li>Fixed a few harmless BoundChecker warnings.</li><li>Should be fewer skips in the 2D system when switching 3D providers (this
is probably as good as we can make this with the Windows 9x's crummy
thread scheduler).</li><li>Switched the filters to be compiled with the VC 6 switch `/QIfist` to allow
fast floating point to integer conversion, while still giving the compiler
good scheduling opportunities.</li><li>Updated the Lagrangian Interpolating filter to the correct source file.</li><li>Added the new AIL_register_3D_EOS_callback function that allows you to
set an end-of-sample callback for 3D samples (added on all 3D providers).</li><li>Switched to using the SetEQ function to model occlusions with a hardware
low-pass filter on A3D 2 cards (sounds as good as EAX).</li><li>Somewhat simplified the threading model in the A3D 2 and QSound providers
(should be a little quicker when starting or stopping sounds).</li><li>Simplified the threading model in the RSX provider drastically (should
respond more quickly).</li><li>Fixed a crash if you changed an A3D 2, EAX 2, or Miles fast 2D settings
before calling AIL_set_3D_sample_file.</li><li>Fixed a problem with the Fast 2D provider where the low-pass filter could
be dropped when replaying the same sound.</li><li>Automatically invert minimum and maximum distances if they are passed in
backwards.</li><li>Fixed the 2D streaming system to handle corrupt or unsupported MP3 files
without crashing.</li><li>Fixed the 2D streaming system to automatically close all playing streams

<ul><li>Switched to a new directory structure to better handle the upcoming multi-
platform support (see ReadMe.Txt for details).</li><li>Added new voice chat codecs and an new client-server system to show it
off (MSSChat.EXE). Since Miles doesn't supply a network layer, our example
uses TCP for its transport. Games should add the voice packets into their
existing network layers for best results.</li><li>Added a new input API for recording digital audio.</li><li>Added new set of 18 DSP-style digital audio filters. Low-pass, high-pass,
equalizers, reverb, EAX emulation with occlusion and more!</li><li>Changed the AIL_set_3D_sample_distances function to only take one set of
minimum and maximum parameters (none of the providers except RSX supported
different front and back distances). You'll have to make a change to your
code to handle for this change.</li><li>Added new 3D functions to set the room type, speaker type, sample effects
level, sample obstruction, sample occlusion, and conical emission for
samples (see the new Exam3D.exe for examples of all of these functions).</li><li>Added three new DirectSound 7 only 3D providers - full HRTF, light HRTF, and
pan and volume only. You must have DX7 installed to use these providers.</li><li>Added a new EAX2 provider with hardware support for occlusions and
obstructions. All of the advanced settings are available as provider and
sample level attributes and preferences.</li><li>The Miles Fast 2D and Dolby providers now offer software emulation of the
EAX room styles. These providers also use a low-pass filter to support
occlusions. Use this functionality with care - each voice with EAX
effects costs 7% of the CPU on a P5/200.</li><li>Added a new function to set the directory that contains all of the Miles
redistributable files (ASIs, M3Ds, FLTs, etc). Just call
AIL_set_redist_directory *before* AIL_startup to tell Miles where to
find its files.</li><li>Upgraded all of the existing 3D providers to support occlusions and
obstructions by simulating them by adjusting the sample volume.</li><li>Added a new A3D2 provider - you can request the A3D2 interface and download
geometry or use our new EAX reverb emulation (we create geometry on the
fly that matches the EAX room styles as closely as possible).</li><li>Added a new QMixer provider (which cannot be redistributed without a license
from QSound - give Mitch a call for details). This provider creates a
nice, sweet 3D sound - definitely worth checking out.</li><li>Added sub-block looping of streamed files.</li><li>Added normal doppler effects to RSX (not based on changing positions, but
rather by the 3D velocity function).</li><li>Removed support for the Microsoft mixer in our DirectSound support (since
there wasn't any reason to use theirs any more). This means that the
DIG_USE_MSS_MIXER preference is gone now.</li><li>Made the DOS examples compile under Win32 or DOS - now stored in a CONSOLE
directory.</li><li>Made the Miles Sound Studio resizable under Win 98 and Win NT.</li><li>Fixed burst of static when running under DX7 with the debug libraries.</li><li>Pre-normalize the 3D orientation before passing it into M3D providers.</li><li>Fixed tons of other small bugs.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 5.0q to 5.0r (09-22-1999)"><b>Changes from 5.0q to 5.0r (09-22-1999)</b></a></b></span></h2>

<ul><li>Improved DirectSound buffering to help skipping under heavy loads and crummy
DirectSound drivers. Added a new preference that allows you to control
how far in advance to mix ahead. Use DIG_DS_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT to control
how many fragments to mix ahead (defaults to eight 8 ms fragments).</li><li>Improved the panning routines in the Fast 2D 3D provider - should pan from
side to side much more smoothly now.</li><li>Fixed a rare waveOut deadlock problem.</li><li>Worked around some A3D stability problems.</li><li>Added a new function to determine the slowest timer response since Miles
was started. Just call AIL_get_timer_highest_delay to get the worst
time (0 means the system is running perfectly). The mixing system will
start to skip when this number exceeds 64 ms. If this happens in your
application, you can use the new preference DIG_DS_MIX_FRAGMENT_CNT to
increase the mix ahead time (at the expense of latency).</li><li>Fixed the EAX constant for flipping back to automatic sample reverb
control.</li><li>Fixed MMX support (goofy bug).</li><li>Fixed callback on preloaded HSTREAMs.</li><li>Changed the type of H3DSAMPLEs to be not defined to an (void*) pointer to

<ul><li>Made the `Maximum supported samples` provider attribute also a *preference*
in the Fast2D, Dolby Surround, and RSX providers. This means you can set
the number of available 3D samples in these three providers by calling the
AIL_set_3D_provider_preference function *before* you call the
AIL_open_provider function. For the Fast2D and Dolby provider, you need
to also insure that their are enough 2D HSAMPLEs available for the number
of 3D H3DSAMPLEs that you request (use the DIG_MIXER_CHANNELS Miles
preference to set the number of 2D HSAMPLEs).</li><li>Made AIL_set_3D_sample_distances and AIL_3D_sample_distances take
F32-typed parameters rather than U32.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 5.0h to 5.0i (03-06-1999)"><b>Changes from 5.0h to 5.0i (03-06-1999)</b></a></b></span></h2>

<ul><li>Changed the calling convention of the RIB-based providers slightly (M3Ds,
ASIs, and FLTs). Make sure you update *all* of your MSS files - not just
MSS32.DLL!</li><li>Added the new Dolby Surround M3D provider. This is a Dolby-certified
run-time 3D positioner. It allows multi-speaker systems like those
from Cambridge Soundworks, Boston Acoustics, and Altec Lansing to play
sounds audio from the rear speakers - `true` 3D sound positioning.</li><li>Added a new filter called `CAPTURE.FLT`. This filter writes all Miles
digital audio output to a specified wave file. This lets you create
complete sound tracks for your running applications! You simply set the
filename and then load the filter to begin recording your application's
output.</li><li>Further support has been added to the standard HSAMPLE-based API for
installable digital audio processor modules, or `filters.` Filters allow
the manipulation of sample data in real time, just before it is mixed into
the driver's output buffer. Several new API functions have been added to
make it easy for applications to select, install, configure, and use filters.</li><li>The use of these new functions is demonstrated in the FILTER.CPP console
application in the FLT directory, along with a simple example filter provider
which emulates MSS's reverb support in an externally-installable module.</li><li>To associate a filter provider with a given HSAMPLE, simply call the existing
AIL_set_sample_processor function with DP_FILTER as the SAMPLESTAGE
parameter. It is not necessary to explicitly open the filter with
AIL_open_filter first; however, be advised that some filters may need to
allocate large amounts of memory or perform CPU-intensive setup processing
when first opened. Calling AIL_open_filter at application startup time may
help avoid perceptible delays when a given filter is associated with an
HSAMPLE for the first time.</li><li>Open filters are cleaned up automatically at driver shutdown time.
Even if AIL_open_filter is called explicitly by the application, it is
not necessary to call AIL_close_filter unless the application needs to free
up resources consumed by a filter which it no longer intends to use. Keep in
mind that each installed filter may add a small amount of CPU-usage overhead
to the MSS digital audio pipeline, even if no HSAMPLEs are using the
filter.</li><li>Filter support is available only in the Win32 MSS API, and only if the
DIG_USE_WAVEOUT or DIG_USE_MSS_MIXER preferences are enabled.</li><li>Added the DIG_F_USING_ASI flag in AIL_stream_info flags return parameter.</li><li>Increased the number of voices available with RSX to 16.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 5.0e to 5.0f (01-31-1999)"><b>Changes from 5.0e to 5.0f (01-31-1999)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Added the new integrated RSX provider (RAD acquired RSX in January 1999).
You can now use the RSX provider without installing RSX first! There
were many improvements made to improve quality and compatibility. Be
sure to try this new provider - it is now one of the best 3D options!</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Fast 2D M3D provider where the default volume level
could be set incorrectly.</li><li>Dropped the volume by 3 db when the sound is behind you in the Fast 2D M3D
provider.</li><li>Improved the speed of stopping 3D samples in the DirectSound3D derived
3D providers.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 5.0d to 5.0e (01-01-1999)"><b>Changes from 5.0d to 5.0e (01-01-1999)</b></a></b></span></h2>

<ul><li>Add a 3D provider that uses the Miles 2D interface (pitch/pan/volume) for
extremely fast simulated 3D audio.</li><li>Fixed a lock-up bug in the MP3 parser where certain non-MP3 data blocks
could cause a crash.</li><li>Reduced the speaker static when loading and unloading 3D providers.</li><li>Added support for wave wrapped MP3 files in the high-level API (both file
name and file handle based).</li><li>Fixed a bug where the end of 3D digital sample could be clipped off.</li><li>Fixed a bug when selecting a non-A3D provider after the A3D provider.</li><li>Forced RSX not to use MMX (which was the cause of the awful clipping noise).</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 5.0b to 5.0c (11-15-1998)"><b>Changes from 5.0b to 5.0c (11-15-1998)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Added software reverb to the digital API. You can now set reverb
parameters on any sample, stream, quick handle, or soft-synth MIDI
sequence. The new functions allow you to set the reverb level
(amount of reverb), reverb decay time, and reverb reflection time.
See the Miles Sound Player for an example of the reverb parameters.</li><li>Fixed a few problems in the Delphi interface.</li><li>Added SBLive info in the driver list (uses the SB16 driver).</li><li>Fixed a bug in the file-based MP3 decompressor where the channels and bits
were inverted in the output wave header.</li><li>Added hardware DLS support for the Aureal Vortex chipset (both Vortex 1
and Vortex 2). Also added hardware DLS selections to the Miles Sound
Player.</li><li>Fixed some thread synchronization problems in the 3D providers.</li><li>Added a DOS without MPEG library.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 5.0a to 5.0b (10-19-1998)"><b>Changes from 5.0a to 5.0b (10-19-1998)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>This is a maintenance release. The .M3D 3D hardware providers have changed,
so be sure to update any copies you currently keep in your application
directory.</li><li>Added AIL_set_3D_sample_info, to allow direct specification of a block
of raw sample data via an AILSOUNDINFO structure.</li><li>Added AIL_set_3D_sample_playback_rate and AIL_3D_sample_playback_rate
functions to allow on-the-fly control of a 3D sample's playback rate.</li><li>Added three functions for per-sample attribute control in the 3D sound API.
AIL_enumerate_sample_attributes, AIL_3D_sample_attribute, and
AIL_set_3D_sample_preference allow per-sample attributes to be listed,
read, and written, respectively.</li><li>Some 3D providers (notably Creative EAX at this time) allow control of
parameters such as effect intensity on a per-voice basis. On the Creative
EAX provider (MSSEAX.M3D), the new per-sample attribute functions will
expose `EAX sample reverb mix`, which can be read with the
AIL_3D_sample_attribute function or written with the
AIL_set_3D_sample_preference function.</li><li>Most applications should not need to set the `EAX sample reverb mix`
preference. If an EAX application creates a sample and does not set this
property, EAX automatically calculates the reverb mix for the sound source
based on its volume and distance. If an application does want to override
EAX's control of this attribute, its value may be varied over the range of
0.0 (no reverb at all added to the source) to 1.0 (the maximum amount of
reverb added to the source). If you want to put the reverb mix attribute
back under the control of EAX, you can set the value using the constant
EAX_REVERBMIX_USEDISTANCE, defined in EAX.H as -1.0F.</li><li>Fixed a bug which could potentially cause deadlocks when setting or
retrieving EAX environment properties.</li><li>Fixed a truncation problem in the AIL_find_DLS function.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the end of stream callback.</li><li>Updated the Delphi interface files to 5.0.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 4.0g to 5.0a (10-04-1998)"><b>Changes from 4.0g to 5.0a (10-04-1998)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Major new version - almost everything changed somewhat. Highlights:</li><li>All new digital mixer (actually the digital mixer from our DLS synthesizer) -
it is much faster, has MMX support, supports on-the-fly filtering, and can
call pre- and post- mix sound processors.</li><li>MSS now uses the new Miles mixer even when running under DirectSound - if you
start and stop many sound samples, then this can increase your performance
dramatically.</li><li>New API for adding runtime bound APIs to MSS (called RIB).</li><li>New API for adding audio codecs to MSS called `ASI` (which is built with RIB).</li><li>New API for adding 3D audio providers to MSS called `M3D` (which is also built
on RIB).</li><li>New MPEG Layer-3 ASI-based decoder (note that you must sign a license addendum
to obtain the decoder). MP3 is integrated completely into MSS - you don't
even have to decompress the MP3 data first (although you can for performance
reasons). MSS does NOT support MPEG Layer 1 or MPEG Layer 2 files, btw.</li><li>New high-level 3D API - with the MSS 3D API, you can support any of the Miles
M3D audio providers (DirectSound software, DirectSound hardware, Aureal's A3D,
Creative's EAX, and Intel's RSX - more coming soon). Note that Intel is
currently working on several bugs in RSX, so the RSX provider is noisier than
it will be.</li><li>New API for high-level access to the Miles mixer. This means you can do format
conversions and pre-mixing in your application (without actually playing the
sound).</li><li>New functions for compressing and decompressing with an ASI codec. Note that
Miles does NOT supply a redistributable MPEG Layer 3 *encoder*. You can
purchase a encoder for use with the Miles Sound Studio for $95, but it is
still not redistributable.</li><li>The DLS synthesizer is now capable of using MP3 compression for the instrument
data. This makes MSS MIDI files even smaller! You must purchase the Miles
MPEG Layer 3 encoder to create these files, however.</li><li>Added a callback to most of the File Format services functions that is called
periodically during lengthy operations (for status displays).</li><li>New function to write out a wave file from just a memory pointer and format
description.</li><li>Improved autodetection of application master HWND.</li><li>New function to retrieve the HWND that the MSS system is using (for DirectSound
and 3D library support).</li><li>Fixed the default pan setting for drum voices in the DLS synthesizer.</li><li>Stream callbacks are now made when the sound completes (rather than when all of
the audio has been read from the file).</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 4.0f to 4.0g (06-11-1998)"><b>Changes from 4.0f to 4.0g (06-11-1998)</b></a></b></span></h2>

explicitly set the HWND of your application. Call this function after
AIL_waveOutOpen.</li><li>Fixed a few bugs in the Miles Xtra with opening digital audio cast members.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Miles Xtra in the positioning command for streaming audio.</li><li>Fixed a crash when there was no event callback installed and an

<ul><li>Fixed bug in waveOut mixing code that could cause all sounds to stop under
very high sound loads.</li><li>Fixed bug in red book volume control for CD devices that allowed stereo
volume resolution.</li><li>Fixed some debug stuff that was left in the Quick example application.</li><li>Switched the newest Causeway (which works around a bug in the Ensoniq VIVO
drivers).</li><li>Fixed a bug if you called AIL_start_sample or AIL_load_sample_buffer from
an EOB or SOB callback (EOS and timer callbacks were fine).</li><li>MSS doesn't look for the application hwnd in AIL_digital_handle_reacquire
again - it just uses the old one.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 3.5f to 3.6a (01-25-1997)"><b>Changes from 3.5f to 3.6a (01-25-1997)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Added a new high-level streaming API - stream disk files in 4 calls!
Streams work just like samples - you can change the playback rate,
volume, pan, loop count, etc.</li><li>Updated the timer system to work around the dreaded Microsoft VC debugger
problem under Windows 95 and Windows NT (slowdowns and crashes when
sitting on a breakpoint for a long time).</li><li>Added volume control functions for redbook audio (AIL_redbook_volume and
AIL_redbook_set_volume). Uses MSCDEX for DOS, the mixer API for Win32,
and the aux device calls for Win16.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the DOS redbook control functions that would sometimes
cause a redbook track not to play (good catch - BullFrog!)</li><li>Integrated the Fatman's General MIDI FM patches directly into the library.</li><li>Added a new function to duplicate an existing quick handle (AIL_quick_copy).
This function doesn't duplicate the audio memory - only the handle info.</li><li>Added two new functions to control the speed and volume of a quick handle
(AIL_quick_set_speed and AIL_quick_set_volume).</li><li>Added a new function to return the digital and MIDI driver handles when
you used the Quick API to init the system (AIL_quick_handles). This
is handy because you can now use AIL_quick_startup to simplify
initializing MSS, and still use the full API for everything else.</li><li>Fixed a bug in AIL_strnicmp that was causing a crash when loading data
out of a 32-bit resource DLL file.</li><li>The MSS DLLs now check to see if they have been incorrectly installed in
Windows or Windows system directory.</li><li>Added the AIL_get_preference function to the DOS API.</li><li>Took out the virtual memory feature of VTOR - use the Smacker utilities
to convert huge wave files to RAWs.</li><li>Fixed a bug in AIL_file_read when an pointer was passed and the read
failed.</li><li>Fixed a bug in AIL_file_write that would free the pointer if the write
failed.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the quick API where the MIDI system occasionally fail to
load under NT.</li><li>Various minor clean-ups in the Delphi interface units.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 3.5e to 3.5f (10-22-1996)"><b>Changes from 3.5e to 3.5f (10-22-1996)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Adjusted the method that the 16-bit DLL locks its memory for extreme
low memory machines (Win3.x and Win32s).</li><li>Fixed potential crash when completely out of DOS memory in the 16-bit
DLL (Win3.x and Win32s).</li><li>Preceded the system functions with `AIL_` to fix function name collisions
with VFX from Miles Design. The old function names are still defined
to match the new names, so no source should have to be changed. </li><li>Because of these function name changes and because Smacker dynamically
links to MSS, you must update to at least Smacker version 2.2B for
MSS 3.50F.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 3.5d to 3.5e (08-18-1996)"><b>Changes from 3.5d to 3.5e (08-18-1996)</b></a></b></span></h2>

<ul><li>DOS version now has all of the features of the Windows version (red book
support, quick-integration API, sub-block looping, etc).</li><li>Fixed error in linked list code of the quick API for Windows.</li><li>Fixed error in AIL_send_channel_voice_message when the driver handle is
NULL.</li><li>Changed AIL_ms_count to call QueryPerformanceCounter under NT.</li><li>AIL_ms_count under DOS inside a Windows DOS box can read the Windows
timer for millisecond accuracy.</li><li>Added `FILE_READ_WITH_SIZE` flag to FILE_READ function, so that it can
return the size of the data read as the first four bytes of the returned
pointer.</li><li>AIL.LIB can be used for register or stack based programs (there is no
need to recompile for stack based programs anymore).</li><li>MSS can now be used with Watcom 9.5 to 10.6. RAD recommends version 10.6.</li><li>Added new AIL_set_driver_directory function to load drivers, .INI
files, and patch files from alternate directory (MSS still always searches
the current directory first).</li><li>You must now call AIL_startup before any other MSS calls (including
FILE_read, MEM_alloc, etc).</li><li>Callbacks are now typed and must use the AILCALLBACK calling convention.</li><li>Added two new redbook functions. AIL_redbook_track returns the current
playing track number. AIL_redbook_retract closes the CD drive door.</li><li>Timer callbacks now synchronize the callback frequency to AIL_ms_count.
This improves MIDI playback drastically under DOS inside a Windows DOS box.
It also prevents long-term timer counting drift if you use MSS timer to
track time (use AIL_ms_count directly for best accuracy).</li><li>DDK has been integrated into the SDK for convenience.</li><li>All example programs and tools have been bound with the Causeway DOS
extender.</li><li>Added new DOS drivers for the AMD Interwave and the NVidia multimedia card.</li><li>The VBL flag no longer used for delaying (in either the library or the
drivers).</li><li>SetSound can display the current Windows 95 configuration when running
in a Windows 95 DOS box.</li><li>Built-in Borland C support for both Windows and DOS PowerPack.</li><li>SoundFont support now supplied directly with MSS.</li><li>AILEXPORT has been renamed to AILCALLBACK for consistency with DOS.</li><li>Renamed main libraries and header to use MSS instead of AIL.</li><li>VTOR uses virtual memory so that large .WAVs or .VOCs can be converted.
Under Windows and Windows 95 DOS boxes, virtual memory is limited to 16 MB,
so you may have to run VTOR under normal DOS to convert really huge files.</li><li>Added 16- and 32-bit Delphi interface units.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 3.04a to 3.5a (04-11-1996)"><b>Changes from 3.04a to 3.5a (04-11-1996)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Add complete built-in DirectSound support. There are
several new DirectSound specific functions - see the docs for details.</li><li>AIL_startup can be called multiple times - but calling AIL_shutdown
closes everything down immediately. This allows you to call AIL_startup
several times in your application, and call AIL_shutdown once in your
closing procedure.</li><li>Fixed a harmless thread handle leak.</li><li>Also fixed is AIL_minimum_sample_buffer_size which was
under-reporting by a factor of 4.</li><li>Added the new Quick Integration API. See the docs for details.</li><li>Added new AIL_digital_configuration call that returns info about the
current sound driver.</li><li>Added new sub-block looping feature - can loop internal pieces of a buffer.
Use the AIL_set_sample_loop_block function to set the loop points.</li><li>Callbacks now work under Win32s - but are not called at interrupt time.
Rather, they are distributed from the Windows messaging system, so you
must yield to Windows to receive callbacks</li><li>Added new Red-Book audio interfaces - play CD audio tracks quickly and
easily.</li><li>Multiple 16-bit and Win32s apps can be loaded at the same time.</li><li>Fixed crashes when running 16-bit DLL with other 32-bit apps or libraries.</li><li>Fixed crashes when memory would move.</li><li>Added new millisecond count call - AIL_ms_count. Allows accurate timing
without having to create absurdly fast timers.</li><li>Added new starvation call - AIL_sample_buffer_info for video players.</li><li>AIL_serve is no longer needed in your message loop. Under Win32, a
background thread handles servicing. Under Win16 and Win32s, a background
task takes care of it.</li><li>MSS now works under Windows NT - (the NT MIDI drivers are still pretty
buggy however).</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 3.03d to 3.04a (02-04-1996)"><b>Changes from 3.03d to 3.04a (02-04-1996)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Integrated Win32s support directly into WAIL32.DLL.
This means you can create one executable that supports Win 95, Win NT,
and Win32s. To support Win32s, you must distribute both WAIL32.DLL and
WAIL16.DLL.</li><li>You must use MEM_alloc_lock for memory that you intend to use for sample
or sequence data (with AIL_set_sample_address, AIL_load_sample_buffer,
AIL_init_sequence, etc). MEM_alloc_lock returns 32-bit pointers
that have been locked and fixed for Win32s. Under Win 95 or Win NT,
MEM_alloc_lock just returns GlobalAlloc-ed memory, so you can use this
function for all environments. If you pass in a pointer that isn't
created with MEM_alloc_lock, MSS will display a error message box.</li><li>HDIGDRIVER, HSAMPLE, HSEQUENCE, etc, are all handles under Win32s -
they are not pointers, so you can't dereference them.</li><li>Internal MSS calls are not captured in the debug trace file when running
under Win32s.</li><li>Callbacks aren't supported yet.</li><li>Fixes segment wrap around in WAIL16 on sound cards that need large Windows
buffers (&gt;64K).</li><li>Marks several variables as volatile, so that WAIL can be compiled with
optimizations on.</li><li>Pointers are checked for validity as they are freed.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 3.03c to 3.03d (11-22-1995)"><b>Changes from 3.03c to 3.03d (11-22-1995)</b></a></b></span></h2>

AIL_set_digital_master_volume command to fail to control the overall
digital output level. This has been fixed.</li><li>The SETSOUND installation program did not uninstall drivers after successful
detection. This caused no reported problems; however, the message `Out of
timer handles` could appear if the user were to select and install any driver
more than 16 times. SETSOUND now uninstalls drivers after detection to avoid
the possibility of this error message.</li><li>The AIL_MDI_driver_type function caused premature termination of debug
scripts when the AIL_DEBUG feature was in use. This has been fixed.</li><li>Memory past the end of XMIDI files could be accessed by AIL_init_sequence,
in cases where XMIDI files smaller than 1024 bytes were played. This caused
occasional page faults in the Windows MSS system, but no problems were ever
reported in the DOS MSS system. This bug has been fixed, however, in both
versions of MSS.</li><li>At the end of an unlooped XMIDI sequence, the sequence loop count is now
reset to 1. This allows a sequence to be restarted without undesirable
looping.</li><li>Under certain rare circumstances, unwanted pauses occurred during XMIDI
playback when using the FOR/NEXT XMIDI controllers or the AIL_branch_index
function. These pauses have been eliminated in this release.</li><li>The AIL_end_sequence function previously called the end-of-sequence (EOS)
callback function, even if the sequence was already done. This behavior has
been corrected.</li><li>The Microsoft Windows Sound System driver (SNDSYS.DIG) has been patched to
fix a bug that caused a detection problem on some systems, particularly
Compaq machines.</li><li>The standard Sound Blaster digital driver (SBLASTER.DIG) could cause lockups
or `Transfer Stack Overflow` messages during detection when running under
Windows 95. This was due to the use of an extremely short DMA buffer to
check for auto-init DMA capabilities. In this release, the DMA verification
buffer in SBLASTER.DIG has been increased in size to avoid problems. No other
drivers, including those for the Sound Blaster Pro and Sound Blaster 16, were
affected by this problem.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 3.03a to 3.03b (06-29-1995)"><b>Changes from 3.03a to 3.03b (06-29-1995)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Changing the digital master volume level had no effect on samples whose
volume level was set to 127. This has been fixed.</li><li>A VMM page-locking problem with the FlashTek DOS extender version of MSS
has been fixed.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 3.03 to 3.03a (06-25-1995)"><b>Changes from 3.03 to 3.03a (06-25-1995)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Sporadic crashes at shutdown time may occur in earlier MSS releases if a
sequence handle is allocated with AIL_allocate_sequence_handle but never
actually initialized with AIL_init_sequence. This patch corrects this
problem, which affected only the MS-DOS versions of MSS.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 3.02 to 3.03 (06-18-1995)"><b>Changes from 3.02 to 3.03 (06-18-1995)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>Two new drivers, SNDSYS.DIG and ESFM.MDI, provide support for the Microsoft
Windows Sound System and ESS Technology ES1688, ES1788, and ES1888 chipsets,
respectively. The SETSOUND program recognizes these new drivers by means of
an updated AILDRVR.LST file.</li><li>Support for the Borland Power Pack and Zortech/Symantec compiler packages is
now available. Please note that by default, the MSS system is built for the
more popular Watcom/Rational package. To use MSS with any other compiler/DOS
extender package, it is necessary to delete all .OBJ, .LIB, and .EXE files and
recompile the desired library version. The .MDI and .DIG drivers, as well as
the files in the TOOLS subdirectory, do not need to be rebuilt.</li><li>Four new functions provide a `master volume` control for all digital samples
and XMIDI sequences: AIL_set_digital_master_volume, AIL_set_XMIDI_master_volume,
AIL_digital_master_volume, and AIL_XMIDI_master_volume</li><li>Please note that like the AIL_set_sequence_volume function,
AIL_set_XMIDI_master_volume will not have the desired effect on sequences
which do not include MIDI Part Volume controllers (7) at the beginning of each
track. Refer to the updated documentation for further information on these
functions.</li><li>The function AIL_register_beat_callback has been added to allow applications
to request callback service at sequence beat transition points. Refer to the
description of this function AND the AIL_sequence_position function in
the documentation before attempting to use either function!</li><li>The function AIL_MDI_driver_type has been added to help applications
identify the synthesis technology provided by various MSS drivers. This
function may be used to select different XMIDI sequences for various sound
synthesis platforms. Refer to the documentation for details.</li><li>A new XMIDI controller has been implemented. The XMIDI Channel Mute
controller (107) can be used to selectively mute channels in sequences. Refer
to the updated documentation for information on the XMIDI Channel Mute
controller.</li><li>The prototypes of the AIL_install_DIG_INI and AIL_install_MDI_INI functions
have been changed to provide enhanced error-reporting capabilities. It is
now possible to distinguish between failure due to a missing .INI file and
failure due to driver initialization or hardware detection problems. Refer
to the updated documentation file for details.</li><li>Previous versions of MSS truncated 16-bit sample data to 8-bit sample data
when panpot or volume scaling was used (panpot != 64 or volume &lt; 127). With
this release, 16-bit sample data is scaled with a multiply/shift sequence that
preserves full 16-bit sample precision.</li><li>For consistency with the new Windows MSS package, the DIG_DRIVER * and
MDI_DRIVER * data types have been replaced with the HDIGDRIVER and HMDIDRIVER
handle types, respectively. The old pointer types may still be used, but
new applications should be written with the new handle types for compatibility
with the Windows MSS API.</li><li>Previous versions of MSS shut down interrupts during the digital mixing
process, which caused problems with high-speed serial communications. By
default, MSS V3.03 no longer disables interrupts at any time during digital
audio processing. A new preference name, DIG_SS_LOCK, has been added to
allow applications to restore the former behavior of shutting down
interrupts while updating the DMA buffer. Few applications should need
to change the DIG_SS_LOCK preference value.</li><li>When playing a stereo digital audio sample on a monaural sound card, previous
versions of MSS truncated the right channel source data and played only the
left channel data. MSS V3.03 allows the AIL_set_sample_pan function to
fade linearly between the left and right source channel in this situation.</li><li>In previous versions of MSS, it was possible under exceptionally rare
conditions for a nested INT 8 interrupt to cause crashes due to stack
corruption. Under Windows 95, however, the probability of protection faults
and crashes is greatly increased. This bug has been fixed for this release
of MSS; additionally, Windows 95 itself has been patched to correct the bug
in legacy applications by automatically modifying the faulty instructions
in the MSS INT 8 ISR. Customers with the retail release of Windows 95 should
not be affected; however, early beta versions (pre-490) can exhibit problems.</li><li>A minor bug in the digital mixer code caused clipping tests to be performed
even with only one actively-playing sample. This bug has been fixed for
this release, resulting in faster digital audio performance.</li><li>The AIL_resume_sample function could fail to operate properly if no other
samples were playing at the time it was called. This has been fixed.</li><li>Reports have been received of lockups with Sound Blaster 16 daughterboards
(such as those from Roland and Creative Labs) which occasionally occur
during extremely intense bursts of MIDI traffic while digital audio is in
use. The MSS MPU401 driver has been patched to provide a partial workaround
for this problem; however, momentary digital audio glitches may still be noted
during fast volume fades and other periods of high MIDI activity.
Because this problem is due to a hardware bug in the Creative chipset, no
completely reliable software workaround is currently known. However,
difficulties arising from the bug are quite rare and should not be a cause
for concern with most applications.</li><li>AIL_start_sequence formerly reset the sequence loop count (if any) to 1,
effectively disabling any loop count previously established by
AIL_set_sequence_loop_count. This has been fixed in version 3.03 --
AIL_set_sequence_loop_count may now be called either before or after
playback begins.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 3.01 to 3.02 (01-18-1995)"><b>Changes from 3.01 to 3.02 (01-18-1995)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>The DRIVERS directory now contains a complete MSS driver configuration
program (SETSOUND.EXE) which may be included in your application. SETSOUND
must be executed before any of the MSS example programs in the DRIVERS
directory can be run. Consequently, the example programs no longer require
driver filenames to be specified directly on their command lines.</li><li>SETSOUND is very easy to use and can shave days or weeks of programming time
from an application's development cycle. However, you should refer to
SETSOUND's complete description in the Tools Reference section of the manual
to help you get the most out of this powerful new utility.</li><li>The contents of the old MIDI and DIGITAL directories have been merged into
the outer DRIVERS directory. Minor revisions have been made to the example
programs and makefiles to accommodate this change.</li><li>SBLASTER.MDI, SBPRO1.MDI, and SBPRO2.MDI now check the BLASTER environment
variable to permit FM sound autodetection at addresses other than 220h.
Previously, only the Sound Blaster-series .DIG drivers checked the BLASTER
variable.</li><li>DMA channel 0 is now available for use with Sound Blaster Pro adapters.
In earlier releases, DMA channel 0 worked only with Sound Blaster 16 boards.</li><li>During autodetection, RAP10.DIG now checks addresses 330H and 320H, using DMA
channels 5 and 6 and IRQ 9. Formerly, IRQ 5 was tested with address 320H.</li><li>The AIL_minimum_sample_buffer_size function could occasionally return
buffer sizes below the actual minimum size when used with the SBPRO.DIG
driver. This bug has been fixed.</li><li>An error-checking problem in the SSTEST example program could cause GP faults
under rare circumstances. This bug has been fixed.</li><li>Updated Gravis UltraSound drivers are now available with this release. These
`native mode` drivers no longer require the ULTRAMID emulation program.</li><li>Two new drivers, ADRV688.DIG and PROAUDIO.DIG, are supplied for use with
ESS Technology's ES688 chipset and Media Vision's Pro Audio Spectrum line,
respectively. Many newer systems from Compaq and other vendors include the
ES688 device, which can support 16-bit stereo sound at up to 44 kHz through
the use of the new ADRV688.DIG driver. PROAUDIO.DIG has been tested and
found to give satisfactory performance on most systems; however, the Media
Vision cards' `native mode` has never been among the most reliable of sound
options, so users should be informed that the SBLASTER.DIG driver can be
used with most Pro Audio Spectrum boards in the event problems occur.</li><li>First version of MSS for Windows is released as version 3.02 with full
MSS API support for 16-bit Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 3.0a to 3.01 (11-22-1994)"><b>Changes from 3.0a to 3.01 (11-22-1994)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>The AIL_background function allows an application function to tell if it
is being executed from within an MSS timer, XMIDI, or callback function.</li><li>The new AIL_set_sample_file function is similar to the existing
AIL_allocate_file_sample function, except that it operates on an existing
sample handle. .VOC or .WAV files may be played using an application's
own sample handles through the use of the AIL_set_sample_file function.
See the API Reference for further information.</li><li>A powerful debugging feature has been added to the MSS API library. If an
AIL_DEBUG environment variable is created with a command of the form
SET AIL_DEBUG=filename, a timestamped log of virtually every MSS API call
made by any subsequently-executed MSS application will be recorded to the
text file or device `filename`. The logfile may be examined to help
diagnose and fix application errors. MSS functions called from within
callback functions will not be logged, along with the functions
AIL_switch_stack, AIL_restore_stack, AIL_unlock, AIL_lock, and
AIL_background.</li><li>Digital support for the Roland RAP-10 device is now available (RAP10.DIG).
This board produces extremely high-quality audio in either 8- or 16-bit,
mono or stereo formats. Use the MPU401.MDI driver for MIDI support with
the RAP-10.</li><li>Digital support for the New Media WaveJammer PCMCIA audio adapter is now
available (JAMMER.ZIP). Use the OPL2.MDI driver for MIDI support with
the WaveJammer.</li><li>Under certain circumstances, double-buffered samples could be terminated
prematurely in previous releases of MSS. This problem has been fixed.</li><li>`Stuck` notes were occasionally reported when shutting down applications
using the Roland RAP-10 and Roland SB16 MIDI daughterboards. This MIDI
hardware overrun problem has been corrected by introducing a slight delay
into functions which flush the XMIDI note queue, such as AIL_end_sequence
and AIL_stop_sequence. This delay should not normally be perceptible
at the application level.</li><li>Revised guidelines for audio-video synchronization have been issued with
this release. The AIL_minimum_sample_buffer_size function returns the
size of the smallest memory block which may be used with the
double-buffering calls. Typically this value will range from 2 to 8KB;
applications must ensure that their video playback engines can provide
sound blocks of this size or greater. See the API Reference for further
information. The DBTEST.C example program now uses
AIL_minimum_sample_buffer_size to allocate its memory buffers. Note that
the `Guidelines for Audio/Video Synchronization` section that appeared in
earlier manual revisions is no longer applicable.</li><li>Under rare circumstances, MSS's built-in VMM locking calls could fail to
lock the last few bytes in a module. This problem was caused by Watcom's
code optimizer; a workaround is now in place.</li><li>The AIL_restore_interrupts function is now prototyped to return void.</li><li>Calls to the AIL_channel_lock function could result in crashes if any
sequence handles were allocated with AIL_allocate_sequence_handle but
not yet initialized with AIL_init_sequence. This problem has been fixed.</li><li>AIL_destroy_wave_synthesizer now releases sample handles allocated by
AIL_create_wave_synthesizer. Previously, these allocated handles were lost
upon destruction of the HWAVE instance.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 3.00 to 3.0a (10-24-1994)"><b>Changes from 3.00 to 3.0a (10-24-1994)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>FlashTek X32 support with the Watcom compiler</li><li>Sound Blaster AWE32 XMIDI support (SoundFont support coming soon!)</li><li>Ensoniq SoundScape native-mode digital and XMIDI support</li><li>Updated Gravis UltraSound support</li><li>The AIL_set_sequence_volume function can now be used prior to calling
AIL_start_sequence. Previously, AIL_start_sequence reset the sequence
volume to its default value. The default sequence volume is now established
by the AIL_init_sequence function, based on the MDI_DEFAULT_VOLUME
preference.</li></ul><h2><span><b><a name="Changes from 0.0 to 3.00 (09-19-1994)"><b>Changes from 0.0 to 3.00 (09-19-1994)</b></a></b></span></h2>
<ul><li>The complete digital audio system, with digital mixing,
mono/stereo support, double-buffering, and individual control over sample
pitch, volume, panning, and stereo balance. Any sample, regardless of
its resolution, rate, channel count, or sign, may be played with any
MSS 3.0 digital driver -- present or future!</li><li>Full General MIDI support, including 16-channel response for all Yamaha
drivers, adjustable pitch-bend range, and information on The Fat Man's
acclaimed Yamaha General MIDI instrument set.</li><li>Over 100 API functions for interactive music and sound effects control.</li><li>Complete documentation of all tools and MSS API functions.</li><li>Support for Watcom C32/C++32 V10.0. Versions 9.5 and earlier may also be
