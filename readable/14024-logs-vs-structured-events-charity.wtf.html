Paraphrasing,</p><blockquote><p>
“So I’ve almost got our group at work up to Step 1 in your observability maturity model, but some of the devs that I work with want to turn OFF our lovely structured logging in prod for informational-level msgs due to their legacy philosophy (‘we only log errors in prod’). The reasons given are mostly philosophical (“I’m a dev and only interested when things error out, I don’t want any other noise in prod logs”, “I don’t want to slow my app down in prod”). Help?!?”</p></blockquote><p>As I was reading this, I was itching to fly out and dive into battle with Eric. I know <i>exactly</i> where his opinionated devs are coming from. I used to say the same things! I even wrote a whole <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/lies-my-parents-told-me-about-logs/">blog post</a> about it.</p><p>These developers have internalized a set of rules and best practices for dealing with output data, in the context of “monolith application development in the early 2000s”.</p><h3>Monolithic systems assumptions</h3><p>Those systems had many common constraints and assumptions, such as:</p><h3>Monolithic logging best practices</h3><p>Therefore:</p><ul><li>We should be very stingy in what we log</li><li>Debuggers should be used for understanding internal states of the code</li><li>Logs are a last resort and record of crash dumps.&nbsp; We do not expect to use log data in the course of our daily work.&nbsp; We assume log-related manual investigation will be infrequent and of limited utility.</li></ul><p>These were exactly the right lessons to learn in the era of expensive hardware and monolithic repos/artifacts. Many people <em>still</em>&nbsp;work in environments like this, and follow logging best practices like these. God bless, more power to em.</p><h3>Distributed systems assumptions</h3><p>But more and more of us face systems that are very different.</p><ul><li>We have many services, possibly many MANY services. A representative request will have “many” hops across “many” services and routers and proxies and meshes and storage systems.</li><li>We cannot model the system in our heads; it would be a mistake to try. We rely on tooling as the source of truth for those systems.</li><li>You may or may not have access to those services, or the systems your code runs on. There may or may not be a logging facility, or a centralized log aggregator. <strong>Your only view of the system is through the instrumentation of your code.</strong></li><li>Disks and system resources are cheap, ephemeral, all but disposable.</li><li>Data services are similarly cheap.&nbsp; We can almost entirely silo application performance off from the cost of writing perf data out.<img data-attachment-id="5237" data-permalink="https://charity.wtf/2019/02/05/logs-vs-structured-events/screen-shot-2019-02-05-at-7-03-04-am/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/screen-shot-2019-02-05-at-7.03.04-am.png?fit=288%2C364&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="288,364" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2019-02-05 at 7.03.04 AM" data-image-description="data-image-description" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/screen-shot-2019-02-05-at-7.03.04-am.png?fit=237%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/screen-shot-2019-02-05-at-7.03.04-am.png?fit=288%2C364&amp;ssl=1" class="  wp-image-5237 alignleft jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i1.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/screen-shot-2019-02-05-at-7.03.04-am.png?resize=216%2C273&amp;ssl=1" alt="Screen Shot 2019-02-05 at 7.03.04 AM" width="216" height="273" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/screen-shot-2019-02-05-at-7.03.04-am.png?resize=216%2C273&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></li><li>Investigation is prohibitively slow and expensive for a human to do by hand.
