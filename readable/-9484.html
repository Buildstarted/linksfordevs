<div id="faq"> 


<p><strong>
What language is Volt written in?
</strong></p><p>
V. It's a new language I created to develop Volt. 
<a href="https://volt-app.com/lang" target="_blank">You can read about it here. </a> 
</p>
<p>Volt uses native UI APIs: (Cocoa on macOS, Win32 API on Windows, GTK+ on Linux). </p> 

<p><strong>
Are my passwords secure?
</strong></p><p>
Volt doesn't ask for your passwords and doesn't store them anywhere.
Authentication is performed in a browser directly on
the platform's website.
</p>

<p><strong>
Is it really only 300 KB?  Or is it just an installer that
downloads another 300 MB? 
</strong></p><p>
No, it's not an installer. The entire app fits into a ≈300 KB ZIP archive, and the only extra thing it downloads
is ≈300 KB of high res icos, which are not required for the app to
work.
</p>
<p> In the age of 300 MB chat clients and 10 MB web pages we started to forget
how powerful our computers are and how much can fit in 1 MB. A lot of time and
resoures were spent to ensure the small size and great performance. 
</p>

<p><strong>
How much does it cost? 
</strong></p><p>
Volt will always be free. 
</p>

<p><strong>
Is my data sent anywhere or shared with anyone? 
</strong></p><p>
No. Volt stores your messages and contacts on your machine for offline use
and better performance. 
That's it. 
</p>

<p><strong>
Are there ads? 
</strong></p><p>
No, Volt will always be ad-free.
</p>

<p><strong>
You don't have ads, and you don't sell user data. What is the sustainability model?
</strong></p><p>
Hopefully as Volt grows, it will get more supporters on Patreon. There will also
be an affordable premium plan for things like having more than 5 accounts.
The base functionality will always be free. 
</p>




<p><strong>
Is Volt open-source?
</strong></p><p>
Not at the moment. Right now the development model is similar
to that of Sublime Text. The app is going to be open-sourced in 2021. 

</p>

<p><strong>
If Volt is not open-source yet, how can I be sure my messages and accounts are secure? 
</strong></p><p>
The plan behind Volt is to build a light, fast, and reliable client for millions 
of users, not to spy on your data or sell it.
</p>
<p>
Volt is a registered European company, all binaries are signed by the company certificate.  
Violating your privacy by sharing or analyzing your data is a criminal offence. 

</p>
 







<p><strong>
Is there a mobile app?
</strong></p><p>
No, sorry, right now the focus is on the native desktop clients.
