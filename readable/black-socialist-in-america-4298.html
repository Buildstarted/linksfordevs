If you have a portfolio to share, please include it as well!</h2><p>Tap to dismiss</p></p></div><p>Black Socialists in America is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. <em>All donations made are tax-deductible as charitable contributions.</em></p><div><div><h2>ANNUAL MINIMUM (SURVIVAL)</h2><p>DONATE</p></div><p>The daily operations of BSA consist of phone calls, emails, social media maintenance, travel, meetings, and more. As of now, we only have one full-time staffer. We also have annual legal and accounting fees. Though this figure is less than ideal, we need at least $60,000 annually in order to survive as an organization (you can think of this as a "life support" figure).</p></div><div><ul><li><div><p>We are an organization that is serious about impacting labor. We find it imperative that we utilize technology in order to make the process of expanding on Dual Power Projects in poor and working-class Black communities accessible, straightforward, safe, democratic, decentralized, and above all else, successful for everyone involved. That is why we are dedicating our time, energy, and resources toward building out on the Dual Power Map to produce the Dual Power App for iOS and Android, which will encourage and facilitate the development of Dual Power Projects like Cooperation Jackson all throughout the country, while simultaneously allowing these projects to reinforce and support each other in building economic democracy. We want to take things even further by integrating DAO blockchain technology into our application, as well as a national “workplace democracy” rating/review system. In order to build on this massive project, we are going to need top-notch developers, programmers, cutting-edge UI/UX designers, cryptographers, and more. Our first move toward bringing this application to life will be completing the “The World of Jackson” page for Cooperation Jackson, an interactive tool that communicates the Dual Power vision at the micro, municipal level starting in Jackson, Mississippi, and that connects it to the more macro vision for society that our organization holds.</p></div></li><li><div><p>We recognize the importance of being able to provide poor and working-class people who are busy at work or on the go with a single, one-stop-shop place on their devices where they can access all of the educational content and updates that our organization is preparing to provide. Instead of having our followers and supporters jumping around from platform to platform trying to keep up with what BSA is saying or doing, we’d like to provide folks with an easy, accessible application for iOS and Android that keeps everything in one place. For this project, we need funds to pay for quality UI/UX designers, software developers, programmers, web developers, graphic designers, and hosting fees.</p></div></li><li><div><div><h2>DAY TO DAY (EXPANSION)</h2><p>DONATE</p></div><p>We’d need around seven or eight more full-time staff in the area of daily operations in order to ensure that we’re able to expand in the ways we know are necessary: two individuals in communications (one for internal communications and digital organizing, and one for social media), an Operations Coordinator, and at least four Field Organizers. These are full-time staff that would be active in addition to our multimedia production team.</p></div></li><li><div><div><h2>MULTIMEDIA PRODUCTION STUDIO</h2><p>DONATE</p></div><p>We want to produce our own fun, original, educational video content to be distributed for free across various social media platforms, and we want this content to be high production value. If we want socialist ideas to reach the masses, it’s not only going to take on-the-ground action, but mass education through culture-shifting, alternative media that is rooted in principles like the ones our organization represents. In order for us to hit on this front, we are going to need a full-time, in-house production team and the involvement of different kinds of Black content creators (writers, directors, editors, visual artists, etc.) who can help us produce video essays, video podcasts, lecture series, live events, and more. We are also going to need our own audio and video equipment, and appropriate spaces in which we can produce various works.</p></div></li><li><div><div><h2>SOCIALIST CURRICULUM</h2><p>DONATE</p></div><p>Our organization not only needs its own unique educational texts to be distributed online and in person, but online courses that allow poor and working-class Black people at different levels of education to find an entry point into wrestling with Leftist theory and tying this into present-day practice under our particular material conditions. We need the resources necessary to pay Black Socialist writers, educators, and developers for the creation of these texts and courses, as well as to pay for distribution costs.</p></div></li><li><div><p>Our organization would like to produce a quarterly journal that allows us to delve into various social and economic issues of the day (along with strategy) from a Black, anticapitalist, internationalist perspective. Here, we’d need funds to pay not only contributors to a journal, but innovative graphic designers and artists, as well as any printing costs.</p></div></li><li><div><p>We have a lot to say, and a lot of people to say things to. We also have a lot of amazing artists and educators who want to collaborate with our organization in bringing fresh ideas to the people in fun and innovative ways. Throwing live events, however, tends to be a costly affair, and we need all of the help that we can get in order to ensure we’re able to cover venue costs, travel and hotel costs for speakers or performers, and a whole array of other costs that come with bringing people together in the real world for productive dialogue and experiences.</p></div></li></ul><div><h5><strong>Hold up...</strong></h5><p>You weren’t just gonna give us your money without seeing where it’s going, were you?!</p><p>Okay, good...</p><p>A lot of nonprofits today are bureaucratic, corporate vessels for nothing but careerism and opportunism.</p><p><strong>It doesn’t matter which celebrity co-signed.</strong></p><p><strong>It doesn’t matter how much media coverage there is.</strong></p><p><strong>Only give your financial support to entities that are effectively doing something – not entities seeking monetary gain and ultimately putting maintenance of the status quo over facilitating substantial change.</strong></p><p>BSA is <strong>NOT</strong> going to be a <a href="https://makelifegood.org/reactive-vs-proactive-activism/" target="_blank">reactive activism</a> organization or a <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/wilde-oscar/soul-man/" target="_blank">charity</a>; these types of entities have their place in society, but we are focused on something more specific.</p><p><strong><em>We are trying to redefine Leftist “organizing” around labor (and more) for our current time.</em></strong></p><p>What is being attempted down in Jackson, Mississippi by our partners Cooperation Jackson cannot simply be reduced to “co-ops.”</p><p>Cooperation Jackson is mapping out a bottom-up, “dual power” strategy in both explicit terms and <strong>PRACTICE</strong>; BSA is here to both showcase this, and inspire + facilitate similar movements all throughout the country.</p><p>Before going through the list below, <strong>PLEASE</strong> have a look at the “<a href="https://blacksocialists.us/our-strategy" target="_blank">Our Strategy</a>” page on our website in order to gain a better understanding for why we are focusing on these particular areas (in terms of funding) as an organization.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p><span>(24.10.2018)</span><span>PSA: </span>We denounce nationalism. We denounce statism. We denounce capitalism. We don’t fight for the American state OR the states of its enemies. We fight for the international proletariat.
