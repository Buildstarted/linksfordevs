<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-5b69adfae26f796ed00b"><div><p><strong>When I was a US Peace Corps Volunteer teaching English in Western Ukraine in 2012 I had a problem in class: cheating. <br></strong></p><p>When the kids finally explained to me their reasoning I started to get it: in Ukraine it wasn’t cheating it was helping a friend. <br></p><p>If one student in the group did poorly it reflected poorly on all the other students. While I didn’t agree with the morality of it I did see the logic of it. Especially when you look at Ukrainian and ex-Soviet Union culture in general. <br></p><p>In America cheating is bad. Cheating is a moral stain on one’s individual merits. Only losers cheats because they didn’t have the moral fortitude to stick something hard out. It’s shamed upon to share answers (usually). This leads to a culture of competition which helps us thrive economically but can create divisions socially. <br></p><blockquote><h3>In the US individuality trumps collectivism or the group. </h3></blockquote><p>Living under the Austrians, Poles, Nazis and Soviet’s and going through forced starvation during Stalin’s Ukrainian Genocide of the 1930s when it was illegal to own bread, you needed the group to just live until the next day. <br></p><p>This group mindset is <em>strong</em>. Many Americans got into trouble with their Ukrainian friends because of our flimsy notions of friendship. <br></p><blockquote><h3>In Ukraine the group is bigger than the individual</h3></blockquote><p>In Ukraine you either would sacrifice your life for your friend and do anything they needed day or night or you were totally ignored. There was no wishy-washyness. <br></p><p>In America we say that we’re friends with everyone when we really just mean “acquaintance”.  Since this concept didn’t exist to Ukrainians they were always puzzled by how many so-called friends these Americans claimed to have! <br></p><p>In the Ukrainian classroom those students all saw each other as true bonded friends they’d do anything for - at least in school. So to them, letting their friend copy notes, or give answers to a test wasn’t just not a big deal, it was morally correct to do so. </p><p>Cultures oscillate between favoring the individual or favoring the group. In America we worship the individual to the point where the group often suffers. In Ukraine they worship the group to the point where the individual may suffer. <br></p><p>Where do you place your emphasis: the individual or the group? <br></p><p>Bren<br></p></div></div></div></div>
