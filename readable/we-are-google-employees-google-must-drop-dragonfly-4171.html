So far, our leadership’s response has been unsatisfactory.</p><p id="73b4" data-selectable-paragraph=""><mark><strong>Our opposition to Dragonfly is not about China: we object to technologies that aid the powerful in oppressing the vulnerable, wherever they may be.</strong></mark> The Chinese government certainly isn’t alone in its readiness to stifle freedom of expression, and to use surveillance to repress dissent. Dragonfly in China would establish a dangerous precedent at a volatile political moment, one that would make it harder for Google to deny other countries similar concessions.</p><p id="13b7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Our company’s decision comes as the Chinese government is openly expanding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its surveillance powers</a> and tools of population control. Many of these rely on advanced technologies, and combine online activity, personal records, and mass monitoring to track and profile citizens. Reports are already showing who bears the cost, including <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/05/31/china-has-turned-xinjiang-into-a-police-state-like-no-other" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Uyghurs</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/07/27/why-is-beijing-afraid-of-chinese-feminists/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.28c481d65315" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">women’s rights advocates</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/world/asia/china-student-activists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">students</a>.

Given the Chinese government’s reported suppression of dissident voices, such controls would likely be used to silence marginalized people, and favor information that promotes government interests.</p><p id="a2ee" data-selectable-paragraph="">Many of us accepted employment at Google with the company’s values in mind, including its <a href="https://publicpolicy.googleblog.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">previous position</a> on Chinese censorship and surveillance, and an understanding that Google was a company willing to place its values above its profits. After a year of disappointments including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Project Maven</a>, Dragonfly, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google’s support for abusers</a>, we no longer believe this is the case. This is why we’re taking a stand.</p><p id="9593" data-selectable-paragraph="">We join with Amnesty International in demanding that Google cancel Dragonfly. We also demand that leadership commit to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/heres-the-letter-1-400-google-workers-sent-leadership-i-1828393599" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">transparency, clear communication, and real accountability</a>.
