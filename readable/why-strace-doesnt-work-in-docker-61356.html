<p>While editing the capabilities page of the <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/containers">how containers work</a> zine, I found myself
trying to explain why <code>strace</code> doesn’t work in a Docker container.</p>
<p>The problem here is – if I run <code>strace</code> in a Docker container on my laptop, this happens:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run  -it ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash
$ # ... install strace ...
root@e27f594da870:/# strace ls
strace: ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, ...): Operation not permitted
</code></pre>
<p>strace works using the <code>ptrace</code> system call, so if <code>ptrace</code> isn’t
allowed, it’s definitely not gonna work! This is pretty easy to fix – on
my machine, this fixes it:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE  -it ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash
</code></pre>
<p>But I wasn’t interested in fixing it, I wanted to know why it happens. So
why does strace not work, and why does <code>--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE</code> fix it?</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-1-container-processes-are-missing-the-cap-sys-ptrace-capability">hypothesis 1: container processes are missing the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> capability</h3>
<p>I always thought the reason was that Docker container processes by
default didn’t have the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> capability. This is consistent
with it being fixed by <code>--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE</code>, right?</p>
<p>But this actually doesn’t make sense for 2 reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Reason 1</strong>: Experimentally, as a regular user, I can strace on any process run by my
user. But if I check if my current process has the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> capability, I don’t:</p>
<pre><code>$ getpcaps $$
Capabilities for `11589': =
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Reason 2</strong>: <code>man capabilities</code> says this about <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code>:</p>
<pre><code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE
       * Trace arbitrary processes using ptrace(2);
</code></pre>
<p>So the point of <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> is to let you ptrace <strong>arbitrary</strong>
processes owned by any user, the way that root usually can. You shouldn’t
need it to just ptrace a regular process owned by your user.</p>
<p>And I tested this a third way – I ran a Docker container with <code>docker
run --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE -it ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash</code>, dropped the
<code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> capability, and I could still strace processes even
though I didn’t have that capability anymore. What? Why?</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-2-something-about-user-namespaces">hypothesis 2: something about user namespaces???</h3>
<p>My next (much less well-founded) hypothesis was something along the lines
of “um, maybe the process is in a different user namespace and strace
doesn’t work because of… reasons?” This isn’t really coherent but
here’s what happened when I looked into it.</p>
<p>Is the container process in a different user namespace? Well, in the container:</p>
<pre><code>root@e27f594da870:/# ls /proc/$$/ns/user -l
... /proc/1/ns/user -&gt; 'user:[4026531837]'
</code></pre>
<p>On the host:</p>
<pre><code>bork@kiwi:~$ ls /proc/$$/ns/user -l
... /proc/12177/ns/user -&gt; 'user:[4026531837]'
</code></pre>
<p>Because the user namespace ID (<code>4026531837</code>) is the same, the root user
in the container is the exact same user as the root user on the host. So
there’s definitely no reason it shouldn’t be able to strace processes
that it created!</p>
<p>This hypothesis doesn’t make much sense but I hadn’t realized that the
root user in a Docker container is the same as the root user on the host,
so I thought that was interesting.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-3-the-ptrace-system-call-is-being-blocked-by-a-seccomp-bpf-rule">hypothesis 3: the ptrace system call is being blocked by a seccomp-bpf rule</h3>
<p>I also knew that Docker uses seccomp-bpf to stop container processes from
running a lot of system calls. And ptrace is in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/">list of system calls
blocked by Docker’s default seccomp
profile</a>! (actually the
list of allowed system calls is a whitelist, so it’s just that ptrace is
not in the default whitelist. But it comes out to the same thing.)</p>
<p>That easily explains why strace wouldn’t work in a Docker container – if
the <code>ptrace</code> system call is totally blocked, then of course you can’t
call it at all and strace would fail.</p>
<p>Let’s verify this hypothesis – if we disable all seccomp rules, can we
strace in a Docker container?</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -it ubuntu:18.04  /bin/bash
$ strace ls
execve("/bin/ls", ["ls"], 0x7ffc69a65580 /* 8 vars */) = 0
... it works fine ...
</code></pre>
<p>Yes! It works! Great. Mystery solved, except…</p>
<h3 id="why-does-cap-add-sys-ptrace-fix-the-problem">why does <code>--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE</code> fix the problem?</h3>
<p>What we still haven’t explained is: why does <code>--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE</code> would
fix the problem?</p>
<p>The man page for <code>docker run</code> explains the <code>--cap-add</code> argument this way:</p>
<pre><code>--cap-add=[]
   Add Linux capabilities
</code></pre>
<p>That doesn’t have anything to do with seccomp rules! What’s going on?</p>
<h3 id="let-s-look-at-the-docker-source-code">let’s look at the Docker source code.</h3>
<p>When the documentation doesn’t help, the only thing to do is go look at
the source.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Go is, because dependencies are often vendored in a
Go repository, you can just grep the repository to figure out where the
code that does a thing is. So I cloned <code>github.com/moby/moby</code> and grepped
for some things, like <code>rg CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s what I think is going on. In containerd’s seccomp implementation, in
<a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/4be98fa28b62e8a012491d655a4d6818ef87b080/contrib/seccomp/seccomp_default.go#L527-L537">contrib/seccomp/seccomp_default.go</a>,
there’s a bunch of code that makes sure that if a process has a
capability, then it’s also given access (through a seccomp rule) to use
the system calls that go with that capability.</p>
<pre><code>		case "CAP_SYS_PTRACE":
			s.Syscalls = append(s.Syscalls, specs.LinuxSyscall{
				Names: []string{
					"kcmp",
					"process_vm_readv",
					"process_vm_writev",
					"ptrace",
				},
				Action: specs.ActAllow,
				Args:   []specs.LinuxSeccompArg{},
			})
</code></pre>
<p>There’s some other code that seems to do something very similar in
<a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/cc0dfb6e7b22ad120c60a9ce770ea15415767cf9/profiles/seccomp/seccomp.go#L126-L132">profiles/seccomp/seccomp.go</a>
in moby and the <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json#L723-L739">default seccomp
profile</a>,
so it’s possible that that’s what’s doing it instead.</p>
<p>So I think we have our answer!</p>
<h3 id="cap-add-in-docker-does-a-little-more-than-what-it-says"><code>--cap-add</code> in Docker does a little more than what it says</h3>
<p>The upshot seems to be that <code>--cap-add</code> doesn’t do exactly what it says
it does in the man page, it’s more like
<code>--cap-add-and-also-whitelist-some-extra-system-calls-if-required</code>. Which makes
sense! If you have a capability like <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> which is supposed
to let you use the <code>process_vm_readv</code> system call but that system call is
blocked by a seccomp profile, that’s not going to help you much!</p>
<p>So allowing the <code>process_vm_readv</code> and <code>ptrace</code> system calls when you
give the container <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> seems like a reasonable choice.</p>
<h3 id="strace-actually-does-work-in-newer-versions-of-docker">strace actually does work in newer versions of Docker</h3>
<p>As of <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/1124543ca8071074a537a15db251af46a5189907">this commit</a> (docker 19.03), Docker does actually allow the <code>ptrace</code> system calls for kernel versions newer than 4.8.</p>
<p>But the Docker version on my laptop is 18.09.7, so it predates that commit.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-all">that’s all!</h3>
<p>This was a fun small thing to investigate, and I think it’s a nice
example of how containers are made of lots of moving pieces that work
together in not-completely-obvious ways.</p>
