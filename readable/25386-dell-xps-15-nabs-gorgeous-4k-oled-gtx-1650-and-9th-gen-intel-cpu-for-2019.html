Known for years to have one of the best displays and an abundance of powerful configuration options including up to the ridiculous Core i9 processor, Dell is not changing too much with it for 2019.</p><p>However, that doesn't mean there's not a lot to talk about either.</p><p>There are three main refinements for the XPS 15 7590 this year: a new high-end display option, Intel's latest 9th generation 45-watt processors, and the newest NVIDIA GPU.</p><p>Following many other manufacturers this year, Dell is offering an edge-to-edge 4K non-touch OLED option. That display can hit 400 nits of brightness, but its real strength is in color accuracy and contrast with 100% DCI-P3 and a 100,000:1 contrast ratio. The screen also has an anti-reflective coating.</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn-deals" class="cta" data-link-type="Limited Time Offers">Save big with VPN deals from ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark &amp; more</a></p><p>For those who want something a bit less flashy, Dell still offers a 4K LCD with touch that hits 500 nits of brightness, and there is still a matte, non-touch anti-glare Full HD display also with 500 nits of brightness.</p></div><div class="article-body__section article-body__section--narrow narrow"><p>The CPU is now bumped to Intel's 9th generation series including a Core i5-9300H (4 cores), Core i7-9750H (6-cores), or a Core i9-9980HK (8-cores).</p><p>The GPU is also being refreshed going from an NVIDIA GTX 1050Ti to the latest GTX 1650, bringing around a 30 percent bump in overall performance, or on average about ten frames-per-second increase for video games on medium graphics.</p><p>Battery size is still either a 56WHr battery or 97WHr, with a crazy claim of up to 20 hours of usage for the latter. RAM is DDR4 and can go up to 64GB and storage is up to 2TB PCIe NVMe.</p><p>Wi-Fi is also getting a boost with the latest Killer AX1650, which includes the new Wi-Fi 6 standard for exceptional radio performance.</p><p>Finally, like its other laptops, Dell is moving the web camera back to the top using a teeny 2.25mm web cam. The downside is there is still no Windows Hello infrared lenses, but users can still use the fingerprint reader built into the power button for secure logins.</p><p>The XPS 15 7590 goes on sale this month in May with general availability in June. Pricing starts at $999 and goes up from there depending on advanced configuration options. Look for our full review in the coming weeks here on this channel.</p></div></div></div></div>
