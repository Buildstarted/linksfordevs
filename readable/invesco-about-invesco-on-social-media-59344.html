<h3>Comment Guidelines</h3>

	<p>Invesco does not endorse any comments other than those we post ourselves. Because of the nature of product-specific speech, and regulations governing recommendations or financial advice, we will remove any comment with specific mention of securities or mutual funds. Many investors may not know that dispensing financial advice is a regulated activity. General discussions on the market are appropriate, but specific mention of investment testimonials or strategies is not permitted.</p>

	<p>If your comment includes personal information beyond your name, or any information regarding your portfolio, we cannot allow it on our social media platforms. These platforms are public spaces, and common sense should prevail. </p>

	<p>Our goal is to host conversation that is relevant and valuable to you. To facilitate this, we ask that you keep your comments within the purposes of the posts made on our individual social platforms. Any comment that is clearly off-topic, makes unsupported claims, or promotes unrelated content or spam will be removed. It should go without saying, but please refrain from inappropriate or abusive language, or personal attacks.</p>

	<p>While we welcome constructive criticism and encourage debate, we may also block, in our sole discretion, any commenter who continues to post material contrary to the guidelines set forth above.</p></div>
