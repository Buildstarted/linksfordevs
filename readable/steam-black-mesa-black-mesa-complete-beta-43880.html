We’ll be watching play throughs and taking feedback to find these issues and fix them. </p><p><b>Performance.</b> We have improved performance across the game, and targeted specific areas to increase the frame rate on all machines. Even with these fixes, there are still some areas we want to improve. For now, don't be afraid to lower your settings if you are getting low frames.</p><p><b>Factory Breaks</b>. We are guessing players will be able to find creative ways to break the factory maps. We don’t expect any of them to be full blockers, but we are anxious to see what players can do to these complex setups, and how we can mitigate issues.</p><p>So it is finally out, on beta, for everyone to play. We hope you enjoy it. We will be watching.</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>Discord - <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.gg/PSZfh8N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://discord.gg/PSZfh8N</a></p></div></div></div>
