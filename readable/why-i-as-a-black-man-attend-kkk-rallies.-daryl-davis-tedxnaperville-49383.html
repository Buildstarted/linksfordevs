            A chance encounter with members of the Ku Klux Klan led black musician Daryl Davis on a quest to determine the source of the hate. His unorthodox, yet simple approach, has wielded surprising results and just might be the solution for all racial discourse.

Today, Daryl owns numerous Klan robes and hoods, given to him by active members who became his friends and renounced the organization.

Since his journey began, Davis has joined an all-white country band, attended KKK rallies, and accepted a ‚Äúcertificate of friendship‚Äù from the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. He‚Äôs even the godfather of former Klan Imperial Wizard Roger Kelly‚Äôs granddaughter.
