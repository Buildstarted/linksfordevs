<p>I did a Q&amp;A a few days ago, and one of the ques­tions was "How does one break
the toy project / codecade­my cy­cle?" ... I am not sure what that mean­s, but
I will take this as an op­por­tu­ni­ty to rant about some­thing I care about that
seems (to me) vague­ly re­lat­ed.</p> 
 <p>You may be feel­ing like you are trapped in a cy­cle of just learn­ing things,
us­ing them in a toy project and then... what? You learn some­thing else?
And do an­oth­er toy pro­jec­t? And so on?</p> 
 <p>And you feel like that is to­tal­ly mean­ing­less and gives you no feel­ing of
achieve­men­t, no mo­ti­va­tion, and end up feel­ing like you are go­ing to
be a new­bie forever?</p> 
 <p>Well, if that's the case ... lis­ten to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Your toy projects feel mean­ing­less be­cause they are not re­al.</strong></p> 
 <p>That feel­ing you have? It's just your in­ner pro­gram­mer telling you to stop 
play­ing around and start proogram­ming for re­al. And I am here to tell you
how to do that.</p> 
 <h2>STEP 1: Find something you need your computer to do that it doesn't do</h2>

<p>You want your  <a href="https://plugins.getnikola.com/v7/continuous_import/">Youtube videos to ap­pear in your blog</a>?</p> 
 <p>You want to be know how many peo­ple called  <a href="https://github.com/ralsina/nombres">Rober­to were born in 1934 in Ar­genti­na?</a></p> 
 <p>Well, imag­i­nary per­son, af­ter you found some­thing like that, you can move to step 2.</p> 
 <p>Let's say you have de­cid­ed to im­ple­ment a gad­get that drives away the birds that 
wake you up ev­ery morn­ing in this end­less night­mare we cur­rent­ly live in.</p> 
 <h2>STEP 2: Decide some basic details about your goal</h2>

<p>This is what is called a projec­t. Im­ple­ment­ing sort­ing al­go­rithms is  <em>not</em> 
a pro­jec­t, that's an ex­er­cise. Im­ple­ment­ing the 200th ver­sion of a chat us­ing
web­sock­ets for your "port­fo­lio" is not a pro­jec­t, it's, I don't know, a bor­ing
ad­den­dum to your re­sumé or some­thing.</p> 
 <p>A project is a goal. A project is "I want my com­put­er to do  <strong>THIS</strong>  and in
the holy name of Bil­ly Wilder, I in­tend to spend the ef­fort to make it do it!"</p> 
 <p>So: I want some­thing that when it de­tects bird sound­s, makes noise to drive them away.</p> 
 <ol>
<li>Lis­tens for nois­es</li>  <li>De­cides whether they are bird nois­es</li>  <li>An­swers with a noise that is un­pleas­ant to birds</li>  </ol>
<h2>STEP 3: Convince yourself that's a possible thing computers can do</h2>

<p>Be­cause, you know, com­put­ers can do a lot of things, but com­put­ers can't do <em>ev­ery­thing</em>. So, you need a quick re­al­i­ty check. Make it very quick, you
don't want to spend more than, like, half an hour on it.</p> 
 <ul>
<li>Can com­put­ers lis­ten for sound­s? Yeah.</li>  <li>Can com­put­ers make sound­s? Yep.</li>  <li>Can sounds drive away bird­s? Yes sir!</li>  <li>Can a com­put­er de­cide whether the noise it hears is a bird or not? Well, may­be? I have seen stranger things!</li>  </ul>
<h2>STEP 4: Come up with a semi-rational mechanism to implement it</h2>

<p>This has to be very vague. Like "yeah, I can do that us­ing this Google API
and this piece of lint I found in my so­fa". A vague idea.</p> 
 <ul>
<li>Im­ple­ment some­thing that lis­tens for noise.</li>  <li>Add some­thing in the mid­dle that de­cides if noise is bird-­like</li>  <li>Make noise de­tec­tion trig­ger code</li>  <li>Im­ple­ment some­thing that makes noise</li>  </ul>
<h2>STEP 5: Come up with the most stupid version of the goal you can imagine</h2>

<p>So, you want to write a bird-de­tec­tor? Try writ­ing a noise-de­tec­tor, first.
Or rather, try to find some­thing that can re­act when your mi­cro­phone de­tects
noise. Or even, find a li­brary that gives you ac­cess to your mi­cro­phone.</p> 
 <p>So:</p> 
 <ul>
<li>Find a li­brary to read sound from mi­cro­phone</li>  <li>De­tect noise</li>  <li>Find li­brary to make noise</li>  <li>Make noise</li>  <li>Con­nect both pieces</li>  </ul>
<h2>STEP 6: sit the fuck down and implement the stupid version</h2>

<p>This should be done FAST. If you plan too much you are not go­ing to do any­thing
oth­er than plan a lot. You want to be­come a pro­gram­mer, not a PM. I won­der
what the PM ver­sion of this rant would look like.</p> 
 <h2>STEP 7: Show the stupid version to someone you respect, and listen</h2>

<p>Yes, this part is scary, but pro­gram­ming is, in large part, about peo­ple.
Show­ing things to peo­ple, lis­ten­ing to peo­ple, find­ing out what peo­ple <strong>re­al­ly</strong>  mean, and so on.</p> 
 <p>So: show it to some­one. Lis­ten. Make de­ci­sions about whether you were right in 
steps 3 and 4. Maybe ad­just a lit­tle what yoour goal is.</p> 
 <h2>STEP 8: repeat step 5 to 7 with a slightly less stupid version</h2>

<p>Do this un­til you run in­to some­thing you have no idea how to do.
In this case that's prob­a­bly go­ing to be "de­cide if that's a bird's sound"</p> 
 <h2>STEP 9: get help</h2>

<p>Ask around. Again, pro­gram­ming is most­ly about peo­ple. In this case, you
will prac­tice "get­ting help". You don't want some­one to just tell you
how (or  <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13103">maybe yes?</a>) but this is the crit­i­cal point.</p> 
 <p>You can run in­to a few sce­nar­ios.</p> 
 <ol>
<li>You fig­ure it out.</li>  <li>You fig­ure out that it can't be done.</li>  <li>You find out that it's doable but you just have no idea how.</li>  </ol>
<p>If you fig­ure it out, then there is no prob­lem! Go back to step 5 and con­tin­ue
un­til you are hap­py with the pro­jec­t, and you have learned some­thing new! Con­grat­u­la­tion­s!</p> 
 <p>The oth­er two out­comes lead to ...</p> 
 <h2>STEP 10: get stuck</h2>

<p>If you fig­ured out that it can't be done, then you have learned about one 
type of prob­lem that is cur­rent­ly in­tractable. Con­sid­er­ing you are new to
this sort of thing, that is prob­a­bly not some­thing you are go­ing to solve,  <em>but</em>  ... if you re­al­ly were in­ter­est­ed in this pro­jec­t, it may point you
to a whole  <em>kind</em>  of thing you want to learn about.</p> 
 <p>So, you can't de­cide if a giv­en noise is a bird ... why? Is there re­search 
be­ing done in that area? Would that in­volve ma­chine learn­ing? Hey, that
sounds in­ter­est­ing. Usu­al­ly the ex­am­ples are about im­ages... is there 
any in­ter­est­ing work be­ing done about ap­ply­ing it to au­dio? Are there
li­braries? Are there dataset­s? Are there tu­to­ri­al­s? Hm­mm ... and now
you know some­thing you want to learn about. Have fun.</p> 
 <p>The third out­come is the com­pli­cat­ed one. Let's say it can be done by cre­at­ing
a mod­el with ML and a dataset of ur­ban nois­es and a dataset of bird nois­es
and both things ex­ist, and it has been done, and you know about it (a lit­tle) 
but  <em>you</em>  have no idea how to do it.</p> 
 <p>Well, in that case ... con­grat­u­la­tion­s, you have found the cur­rent lim­it of your 
com­pe­tence. You just need to ex­pand it. And that's what pro­gram­ming is like.</p> 
 <h2>So, how does this whole convoluted process help you?</h2>

<p>You are learn­ing  <strong>dif­fer­ent</strong>  things you won't learn do­ing ex­er­cis­es.</p> 
 <ul>
<li>You learn to de­cide what to do.</li>  <li>You learn to ask for help.</li>  <li>You learn to present your work to oth­er­s.</li>  <li>You learn to process feed­back.</li>  <li>You learn to re­search your prob­lem space.</li>  <li>You learn to break down tasks.</li>  <li>You learn to make de­ci­sion­s.</li>  </ul>
<p>And yes, you may learn a pro­gram­ming skill or two.</p> 
 <p>And, maybe (but it's un­like­ly) you will get rid of those pesky morn­ing bird­s.</p>
