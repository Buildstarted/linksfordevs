		<p>I’m thrilled to announce that Blazor WebAssembly is now officially released. This is a fully-featured and supported release of Blazor WebAssembly that is ready for production use. Full stack web development with .NET is now here!</p>
<h2>Get started</h2>
<p>Getting started with Blazor WebAssembly is easy: simply go to <a href="https://blazor.net/" target="_blank">https://blazor.net</a> and install the latest <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1" target="_blank">.NET Core SDK (3.1.300 or later)</a>, which includes everything you need to build and run Blazor WebAssembly apps.</p>
<p>You can then create and run your first Blazor WebAssembly app by running:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>dotnet </span></span><span><span>new</span></span><span><span> blazorwasm </span></span><span><span>-</span></span><span><span>o </span></span><span><span>BlazorApp1</span></span><span><span>
cd </span></span><span><span>BlazorApp1</span></span><span><span>
dotnet run</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Browse to https://localhost:5001 and <em>voilà!</em> You’ve just built and run your first Blazor WebAssembly app!</p>

<p>To maximize your Blazor productivity, be sure to install a supported version of Visual Studio for your platform of choice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=community" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2019 16.6</a></li>
<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio-mac/?sku=communitymac" target="_blank">Visual Studio for Mac 8.6</a></li>
<li><strong>Windows/macOS/Linux</strong>: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp" target="_blank">C# extension</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can find additional docs and samples on <a href="https://blazor.net/" target="_blank">https://blazor.net</a>.</p>
<h2>Upgrade an existing project</h2>
<p>If you already have an existing Blazor WebAssembly project, you can upgrade it from the 3.2.0 Release Candidate to the official 3.2.0 release by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update all Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.* and System.Net.Http.Json package references to version 3.2.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it, you’re all set!</p>
<h2>What is Blazor WebAssembly?</h2>
<p>In case this is your first time learning about Blazor, let me introduce you to what Blazor WebAssembly is all about.</p>
<p>Blazor is an open source and cross-platform web UI framework for building single-page apps using .NET and C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor is based on a powerful and flexible component model for building rich interactive web UI. You implement Blazor UI components using a combination of .NET code and Razor syntax: an elegant melding of HTML and C#. Blazor components can seamlessly handle UI events, bind to user input, and efficiently render UI updates.</p>
<p>Blazor components can then be hosted in different ways to create your web app. The first supported way is called Blazor Server. In a Blazor Server app, the components run on the server using .NET Core. All UI interactions and updates are handled using a real-time WebSocket connection with the browser. Blazor Server apps are fast to load and simple to implement. Support for Blazor Server is available with .NET Core 3.1 LTS.</p>
<p>Blazor WebAssembly is now the second supported way to host your Blazor components: client-side in the browser using a WebAssembly-based .NET runtime. Blazor WebAssembly includes a proper .NET runtime implemented in WebAssembly, a standardized bytecode for the web. This .NET runtime is downloaded with your Blazor WebAssembly app and enables running normal .NET code directly in the browser. No plugins or code transpilation are required. Blazor WebAssembly works with all modern web browsers, both desktop and mobile. Similar to JavaScript, Blazor WebAssembly apps run securely on the user’s device from within the browser’s security sandbox. These apps can be deployed as completely standalone static sites without any .NET server component at all, or they can be paired with ASP.NET Core to enable full stack web development with .NET, where code can be effortlessly shared with the client and server.</p>
<h2>Fully-featured</h2>
<p>Blazor WebAssembly comes packed with features to keep you productive on your next web app project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage the productivity of C# and strong runtime typing.</li>
<li>Build on the stable and mature .NET ecosystem.</li>
<li>Easily reuse code and existing .NET Standard libraries on the client and server.</li>
<li>Shared <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/components" target="_blank">component model</a> with Blazor Server apps.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/blazor/" target="_blank">Deploy your app</a> as a standalone static site, or hosted with ASP.NET Core.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/progressive-web-app" target="_blank">Build Progressive Web Apps (PWA)</a> with offline capabilities and native OS integration.</li>
<li>Built-in support for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/blazor/webassembly/" target="_blank">authentication</a>.</li>
<li>Integrated <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/globalization-localization" target="_blank">globalization &amp; localization</a> support.</li>

<h2>Blazor in action</h2>
<p>Blazor WebAssembly has everything you need to build fully-featured production web apps. To see all these Blazor WebAssembly features in action, checkout Steve Sanderson’s on-demand BUILD session (link should be live after 12pm PT): <a href="https://aka.ms/blazor-in-action" target="_blank">Modern Web UI with Blazor WebAssembly</a>.</p>
<h2>Ready-made components</h2>
<p>Of course, any web app is going to need beautiful and feature rich components. A variety of Blazor UI components are available from our fantastic partners that work great in any Blazor app, including Blazor WebAssembly apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui" target="_blank">Telerik</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/blazor-razor-components/" target="_blank">DevExpress</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.syncfusion.com/aspnet-core-blazor-components" target="_blank">Syncfusion</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blazor.radzen.com/" target="_blank">Radzen</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-blazor" target="_blank">Infragistics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.grapecity.com/componentone/blazor-ui-controls" target="_blank">GrapeCity</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Open-source community</h2>
<p>Blazor also has a thriving open-source community and ecosystem. Members of the community, (folks just like you!) have built lots of great component libraries, interop libraries, test frameworks, and more, and then made them freely available for you to use. You can find many of these community projects listed on the <a href="https://aka.ms/awesomeblazor" target="_blank">Awesome Blazor GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<h2>LTS or Current?</h2>
<p>Blazor WebAssembly 3.2.0 is a fully supported release under the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core" target="_blank">.NET Core Support Policy</a>. Since this is the first release of Blazor WebAssembly, it is a Current release, not an LTS release; it does not the inherit LTS status of .NET Core 3.1. This means that once Blazor WebAssembly ships with .NET 5 later this year, you will need to upgrade to .NET 5 to stay in support. We expect Blazor in .NET 5 to be a highly compatible release.</p>
<h2>What’s next?</h2>
<p>Now that we have shipped Blazor WebAssembly, we are shifting our attention to .NET 5. Work has already started on making Blazor WebAssembly available with .NET 5, which we expect to complete for preview next month.</p>
<p>We also have a number of Blazor features and improvements that we are investigating for the .NET 5 &amp; 6 wave. You can see the list of core deliverables that we are considering in the  <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21514" target="_blank">Blazor Roadmap for .NET 5</a> issue on GitHub. Please note that we consider this list to be highly aspirational. While we hope to deliver all of the improvements listed, there are still many unknown and plans will certainly change as we go. We also expect that there will be plenty of smaller improvements that we will deliver as well.</p>
<p>We are also continuing to collaborate with our friends on the Xamarin team on experimental support for building native UI using Blazor through the <a href="https://aka.ms/mobile-blazor-bindings" target="_blank">Mobile Blazor Bindings</a> project. This includes some early efforts to explore building hybrid UI for native apps, which we hope to share more about soon.</p>
<h2>Thank you</h2>
<p>We sincerely appreciate all the enthusiastic support we have received from the Blazor community as we’ve worked to make the release a reality. The number of Blazor articles, blog posts, docs, sample apps, libraries, books, videos, presentations, workshops, courses, meetups, feature suggestions, and feedback issues that have been contributed by the community to the Blazor ecosystem even while it was still in preview has been truly outstanding. To everyone who helped make this release possible, thank you! We couldn’t have done it without you.</p>
<h2>Try Blazor today</h2>
<p>We hope you enjoy this release of Blazor WebAssembly. Give Blazor a try today by going to <a href="https://blazor.net/" target="_blank">https://blazor.net</a>. We look forward to seeing what you create with it.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions of feedback about Blazor please let us know by <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues" target="_blank">filing an issue on GitHub</a>.</p>
