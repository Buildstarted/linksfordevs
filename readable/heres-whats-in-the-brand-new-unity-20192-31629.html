<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>We have over 1000 developers dedicated to extending and improving Unity for you. In this release, you get more than 170 new features and enhancements for artists, designers, and programmers. We’ve updated ProBuilder, Shader Graph, 2D Animation, Burst Compiler, UI Elements, and many more. Read on for the highlights.</p>

<p><span>But before we tell you about all the great new additions and improvements, note that we’ve revamped our release announcement too. You no longer have to scroll/scan a super-long post just to find what’s most pertinent for you or your team. Here we give you just the highlights, plus handy links to </span><span>dedicated webpages</span><span> featuring all the update info organized by an </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>overview</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/artist-and-designer-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>artist and designer tools</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/programmer-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>programmer tools</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/graphics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>graphics</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/platforms-and-editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>supported platforms</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="880" height="495" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uaw32_y6xZ8?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.unity3d.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" bf_offer_id="1879468174" data-gtm-yt-inspected-11775633_46="true" id="617496370"></iframe></p>
<p><b>But before you dive in, why not start downloading 2019.2 <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/update">now</a>.</b></p>
<p><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/artist-and-designer-tools#probuilder-4-0-verified-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>ProBuilder 4.0</span></a><span> ships as verified with 2019.2 and is our unique hybrid of 3D modeling and level design tools, optimized for building simple geometry but capable of detailed editing and UV unwrapping as needed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/artist-and-designer-tools#polybrush-preview-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Polybrush</span></a> <span>is now available via Package Manager as a Preview package. This versatile tool lets you sculpt complex shapes from any 3D model, position detail meshes, paint in custom lighting or coloring, and blend textures across meshes directly in the Editor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/artist-and-designer-tools#dspgraph-audio-mixingrendering-system-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>DSPGraph</span></a><span> is the new audio rendering/mixing system, built on top of Unity’s C# Job System. It’s now available as a Preview package.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We have improved how </span><a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/04/23/whats-new-with-uielements-in-2019-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>UI Elements</span></a><span>, Unity’s new UI framework, </span><span>renders UI for graph-based tools such as Shader Graph, Visual Effect Graph, and Visual Scripting. These changes provide a much smoother and responsive feel when you author more complex graphs in the Editor</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>To help you better organize your complex graphs, we have added subgraphs to </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/graphics#visual-effect-graph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Visual Effect Graph</span></a><span>. You can share, combine, and reuse subgraphs for blocks and operators, and also embed complete VFX within VFX. We’ve also improved the integration between Visual Effect Graph and the High-Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), which pulls VFX Graph in by default, providing you with additional rendering features.</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>With </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/graphics#shader-graph-improvements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Shader Graph</span></a> <span>you can now use </span><a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ScriptableRenderPipeline/blob/master/com.unity.shadergraph/Documentation~/Color-Modes.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Color Modes</span></a><span> to highlight nodes on your graph with colors based on various features or select your own colors to improve readability. This is especially useful in large graphs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We’ve added swappable Sprites functionality to the </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/artist-and-designer-tools#2d-animation-swappable-sprites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>2D Animation tool</span></a><span>. With this new feature, you can change a GameObject’s rendered Sprites while reusing the same skeleton rig and animation clips. This lets you quickly create multiple characters using different Sprite Libraries or customize parts of them with Sprite Resolvers. Now you can swap Sprites to create characters that are completely different visually but use the same animation rig.</span></p>

<h2>Tools for programmers</h2>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/programmer-tools#burst-compiler-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Burst Compiler</span></a><span> came out of Preview in 2019.1. With this release, Burst Compiler 1.1 includes several improvements</span> <span>to JIT compilation time and some C# improvements.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/programmer-tools#typecache-api-editor-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>TypeCache</span></a> <span>provides a fast way to access types or methods marked with specific attributes, as well as types derived from a specific class or interface. It utilizes an internal native cache that is built for all assemblies loaded by the Editor.</span></p>
<p><span>For </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/programmer-tools#ios-and-android-improvements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>developers of mobile apps</span></a><span> we have introduced screen brightness controls via the new Screen.brightness property (iOS and Android) and improved the ReplayKit API (iOS). We’ve also made it easier to adjust your UI by adding support for detecting the bounding box around the notch(es).</span></p>
<p><span>We’ve migrated the </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/programmer-tools#physx-cloth-solver-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>PhysX Cloth Library</span></a><span> from the previous PxCloth to NvCloth</span> <span>as part of our transition from PhysX 3.4 to PhysX 4.x.</span></p>
<p>In this release, we updated the default editors to Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2019 for Mac. We’ve also started to move the <a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/programmer-tools#ide-support-moving-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Editor Integrations</a> (and thus IDEs) from core to packages, and exposed our C# APIs. With this release, the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JetBrains Rider</a> integrations are available as packages; <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio</a> will be available as a package in an upcoming release.</p>
<p><span>We’ve removed the old </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/programmer-tools#net-4x-now-default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>.NET 3.5</span></a><span> Equivalent Scripting Runtime. Any projects that use the .NET 3.5 Equivalent Scripting Runtime will be automatically updated to use the .NET 4.x Equivalent Scripting Runtime.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/programmer-tools#incremental-garbage-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Incremental Garbage Collection</span></a><span>, released as experimental on some platforms in Unity 2019.1, now supports all platforms except WebGL.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This release also includes support for the Intel</span><span>®</span> <a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/programmer-tools#intelr-vtunetm-amplifier-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>VTune</span></a><span>™ Amplifier for the Windows Standalone Player (x86, 64-bit) and Windows Editor, including sampling profiling of C# code.</span><span><br>

<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p><span>In this release, our </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/graphics#high-definition-render-pipeline-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>High-Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)</span></a><span> includes an </span><span>Arbitrary Output Variables (AOV) API</span><span>, allowing you to output material properties only, lighting only, depth buffer, and other passes from the Scene. As well, this API is now used in the </span><a href="https://unitytech.github.io/unity-recorder/manual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Unity Recorder</span></a><span>, which makes it easy to export specific outputs for rendering with HDRP.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ve also added Dynamic resolution, which allows you to scale the resolution at which the world is rendered, with hardware dynamic resolution support. This gives you better performance compared to software dynamic resolution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><span>MatCap debug view mode</span><span> replaces the material and lighting of objects with a simple environment texture. This mode is useful for navigating and getting a sense of the Scene without having to set up the Scene lighting. For example, if you are editing a dark area, like the inside of a cave, this makes it easier to navigate in low lighting.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The new </span><span>Ambient Occlusion</span><span> effect is a screen-space shading and rendering algorithm that improves the quality of ambient lighting simulation in your Scene, especially for small-scale details, while providing good performance. You can choose from several options to optimize for performance and quality.</span></p>
<p><span>There are </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/graphics#new-2d-lights-and-pixel-perfect-lwrp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>new 2D features in the Lightweight Render Pipeline (LWRP)</span></a> <span>such as the experimental 2D Renderer, which now contains 2D Pixel Perfect and 2D Lights. The new 2D Lights enable you to easily enhance visuals of 2D projects directly without having to use 3D lights or custom shaders.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/graphics#shader-graph-improvements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Shader Graph</span></a> <span>now has 2D Master nodes to create 2D Unlit and Lit Sprite Shaders. Additionally, </span><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@6.9/manual/Precision-Modes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>precision modes</span></a><span> let you set nodes to use less GPU memory, which helps increase performance on diverse platforms, including mobile.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/graphics#lighting-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Lightmap denoising</span></a><span> now works on all Editor platforms, regardless of GPU manufacturer. We have also made a fundamental change in how you configure the baking, giving you new possibilities for speeding up lightmap baking. As well, we’re introducing new </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/graphics#probe-lit-gi-contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>probe workflows</span></a><span>. </span><span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>With Probe-Lit GI Contributors, you can choose if objects that Contribute Global Illumination should receive GI from Light Probes or lightmaps. This allows Mesh Renderers to contribute to bounced lighting calculations without occupying texels in the lightmap, which can lead to huge improvements in bake times and reduced memory usage.</span></p>
<p><span>This release also includes major speed improvements in our </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/graphics#gpu-lightmapper-improvements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>GPU Lightmapper</span></a><span>, especially during lighting iterations. New features include Multiple Importance Sampling support for environment lighting and increased sampling performance when using view prioritization or small/low occupancy lightmaps.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/graphics#nvidia-optix-ai-denoiser-lightmaps-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>NVIDIA OptiX AI Denoiser</span></a><span> has been upgraded for better performance and lower memory usage, and to add support for NVIDIA Turing GPUs. It is supported in the GPU Lightmapper.</span></p>
<p><span>Lightmapping now supports the Intel </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/graphics#lighting-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Open Image Denoise library</span></a><span>, which is a machine-learning-based filter. It will improve your lightmapping workflow and lightmap quality by post-processing lightmaps. Noise and unwanted artifacts are removed so that you can get smooth, noise-free lightmaps that use far fewer samples.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image1-5.jpg"><img src="https://blogs.unity3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image1-5.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blogs.unity3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image1-5.jpg 1280w, https://blogs.unity3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image1-5-768x144.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></a></p>
<h2>Platforms and Editor workflows</h2>
<p><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/platforms-and-editor#optimized-frame-pacing-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Optimized Frame Pacing for Android</span></a><span>, developed in partnership with Google’s Android Gaming and Graphics team, provides consistent frame rates and hence smoother gameplay experience by enabling frames to be distributed with less variance.</span></p>
<p><span>Mobile developers will also benefit from improved </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/platforms-and-editor#improved-opengl-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>OpenGL support</span></a><span>, as </span><span>we have added </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/platforms-and-editor#improved-opengl-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>OpenGL multithreading support (iOS)</span></a><span> to improve performance on low-end iOS devices that don’t support Metal. We also added </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/platforms-and-editor#improved-opengl-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>OpenGL support for SRP batcher</span></a><span> for both iOS and Android to improve CPU performance in projects that use the Lightweight Render Pipeline (LWRP).</span></p>
<p><span>We have added an </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/platforms-and-editor#apk-size-check-using-android-app-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>APK size check using Android App Bundle</span></a><span> so you can see the final APK size of different targets for large apps.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are working with VR, try out </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/platforms-and-editor#vr-support-hdrp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>HDRP, which now supports VR</span></a><span> too.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We’re also introducing a revamped </span><a href="https://unity.com/releases/2019-2/platforms-and-editor#sdk-loading-management-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>SDK loading and management system</span></a><span> for your target platforms to help streamline your development workflow. The system is currently in Preview and we’re looking for users to try out the new workflow and to give us feedback. </span><span><br>
</span></p>
