<p>We know the idea of yet another “cinematic universe” sounds stale, especially after Universal’s Dark Universe left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth. But we are ready to dig in on this latest endeavor, because it could be delicious. <a href="https://nerdist.com/tag/general-mills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Mills</a> wants to launch all new stories with their cereal monster mascots, and it wants you to pitch them your best idea.<img src="https://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Work-with-the-monsters-615x218-1.png" data-lazy-type="image" data-lazy-src="https://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Work-with-the-monsters-615x218-1.png" alt="">“<a href="https://www.workwiththemonsters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Work With the Monsters</a>” is not a fan contest with a prize. General Mills is turning to Hollywood “calling all filmmakers, actors, agents, writers, producers, animators, tastemakers, dealmakers, movers and shakers” looking for creative partners with creative ways to help bring their iconic mascots to life across any and all mediums.</p>
<blockquote><em>“We want to work with you to bring great stories to life. From mythical fables to magical journeys. Fairy tales to folk tales. Cliffhangers to nail-biters. Heroic sagas to cosmic battles. Binge-worthy dramas to historical epics. Blockbusters to indies. Serials to sequels.”</em></blockquote>

<p>If you want to <a href="https://www.workwiththemonsters.com/how-this-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit an idea</a>, first you have to tell General Mills who you are and why they should work with you. They “want to establish a long working partnership with the best talent in the business,” so you’ll need a rÃ©sumÃ© that impresses. If interested, they will then confirm if your credentials hold up or get soggy the longer they sit there. Once you are approved you can pitch an idea. Then an “eager group of filmmakers, producers, writers and lawyers, of course, will review your pitch,” and if they chose it you will “work together to bring it life.”You might be able to bring Count Chocula, Frankenberry, and Boo Berry to the big screen. Or the little screen! Or the computer screen!! OR MAYBE EVEN A VIRTUAL REALITY SCREEN!…Sorry, we’re just a little excited. We didn’t expect to be so hungry for another cinematic universe, but since this combines beloved characters, cereal, and monsters, rarely has one sounded so tasty. Literally.What’s your best pitch for a cereal mascot story? Share it with us in the comments section below.</p>
