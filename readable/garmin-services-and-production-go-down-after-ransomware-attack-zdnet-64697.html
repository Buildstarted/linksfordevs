                    <figure><span><img src="https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/07/23/5c0d7f30-8d80-48ec-854e-0a958146ccb5/garmin-website.png" alt="garmin-website.png"></span><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p>Smartwatch and wearables maker Garmin has shut down several of its services on July 23 to deal with a ransomware attack that has encrypted its internal network and some production systems.   </p>
    

                        
    <p>The company is currently planning a multi-day maintenance window to deal with the attack's aftermath, which includes shutting down its official website, the Garmin Connect user data-syncing service, and even some production lines in Asia.   </p><p>In messages shared on its website and Twitter, Garmin said the same outage also impacted its call centers, leaving the company in the situation of being unable to answer calls, emails, and online chats sent by users.   </p><p>The incident didn't go unnoticed and has caused lots of headaches for the company's customers, most of which rely on the Garmin Connect service to sync data about runs and bike rides to Garmin's servers, all of which went down on Thursday.</p><figure><span><img src="https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/07/23/6ef778f8-84d8-41e3-ad95-4630cfbb44e3/garmin-outage.png" alt="garmin-outage.png" data-original="https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/07/23/6ef778f8-84d8-41e3-ad95-4630cfbb44e3/garmin-outage.png"></span><figcaption><span></span><span>

                                                </span></figcaption></figure><p>When <em>ZDNet </em>reached out for comment earlier, a Garmin spokesperson declined to confirm that the outage was caused by a ransomware attack, citing an ongoing investigation, and they redirected us to a message the company had shared <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/c10002-p1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">on its website</a> and Twitter profile.   </p><figure>

<p>However, since the incident took root at around 03:00am UTC, several Garmin employees took to social media to share details about the attack, all calling it a ransomware attack.   </p><p>Some Garmin employees even went as far as to attribute the incident to a new strain of ransomware that appeared earlier this year, called <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-wastedlocker-ransomware-demands-payments-of-millions-of-usd/" target="_blank">WastedLocker</a> -- information that <em>ZDNet</em> has not been able to verify based on employee claims.   </p>


    
<p>However, the incident appears to be much larger and more devastating than Garmin indicated via its initial statement.   </p><p><strong>Must read:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-is-now-your-biggest-online-security-nightmare-and-its-about-to-get-worse/" target="_blank">Ransomware is now your biggest online security nightmare.
