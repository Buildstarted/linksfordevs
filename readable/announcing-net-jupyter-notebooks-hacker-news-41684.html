As much as I wish Observable's choice of JS could provide a viable data environment, and I've personally invested in making it so and the path to making it first-class is clear, we need way more gov/google/nvidia/etc. support.</p><p>Ultimately, for not-too-sensitive collaborative data work, we use Google Colab, then offline and sensitive commercial work via Jupyter (Graphistry ships with it preloaded for GPU dataframe &amp; GPU visual graph analytics goodness!), and if we did more in JS tutorial land, Observable would be my first choice.

The alternative/old way was just too painful (lots of manual steps).</p><p>But although reuse <i>by others</i> is a touted feature, it's not really that important. It's incredibly useful for one's own workflow. Think of the convoluted Excel sheets people often have at engineering companies. They get new data, copy and paste it into Excel, and get new plots.

For a lot of those cases, a notebook is a great way to show how the code works and how it all comes together.</p><p>Another set of use cases is you've done some research, need to call a few api's, post process the results, and share that with your team or have it ready for later to do something similar.  You could think of this as a "Super Postman".  For example, you need to run some api's in a loop, filter the results, and accumulate some things and print totals at the end.</p><p>Another use case is you're troubleshooting an issue, and want to keep notes of what you've tried, what the results were, and be ready to go back and run things again.

The user experience of getting setup for them and the audience they reach needs to be streamlined. From there if it JustWorks™ F# should do the rest of the selling :)</p><p>And to digress, because I always mention this when talking about F#, it deserves a batteries included web framework story as good as Elixir's Phoenix.

I don’t remember the same kind of pain when playing around with Mathematica.  I really want to like it and learn it — I really like interactive programming.  It just never makes it high enough on my brain space list to seem worth it.<p>Since C# is my daily language, this is pretty cool though.  I just really wish that I had a use-case strong enough for it to overcome the initial pains of learning it and the ongoing mental maintenance of staying usefully fluent in yet another set of libraries.

Data wrangling, plotting, machine-learning, logging, writing to file/DB... It doesn't help that there are often multiple competing packages that solve basically the same problem in different ways, ensuring that whatever choice you make will be fraught with anxiety about not "doing it right."<p>That being said, I've found the only way I can get interactive programming to stick in my mind is to pick a sample dataset, wonder some open-ended questions about it, and then answer those questions in a Jupyter notebook with the help of Google, documenting your thought process as you go. A great starting point to find real-world sample data is the UCI dataset repository: <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php" rel="nofollow">https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php</a>

More finance domain functions and docs improvements are on my to-do list.<p>I am really excited about the new Data Frame from corefxlab to complement what Deedle lacks. Since Deedle's original core engineering team has left and moved on, some core technical debt are beyond my capability to address. But Deedle is still the best data frame library in .Net ecosystem for now if you are able to get around some of its odd edges.
