Despite decades of development of modern cryptography promising to
protect our privacy, we live in a golden age of
surveillance. Government agencies are collecting more data than
ever. Facebook data regarding 87 million users was used by Cambridge
Analytica to manipulate elections.  Android apps can and do track your
location even when you turn off Location History. An Oregon couple
reported that their Amazon Echo had recorded a private conversation
and sent the recording to someone on their contact list. In the past
decade, 176 million health-care records have been reported stolen in
the U.S. alone. Regarding protection of user privacy, Apple CEO Tim
Cook admits that "the free market is not working". This workshop will
feature several talks on the current situation and prospects for the
future.
