 [ Video ]
 [ <a href="slides/Lightning-Denny-clacc.pdf">Slides</a> ]<br><i>Joel E. Denny (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), Seyong Lee (Oak Ridge
  National Laboratory), Jeffrey S. Vetter (Oak Ridge National Laboratory)</i><p>We are developing production-quality, standard-conforming OpenACC [1]
compiler and runtime support in Clang and LLVM for the US Exascale Computing
Project [2][3].  A key strategy of Clacc's design is to translate OpenACC
to OpenMP in order to leverage Clang's existing OpenMP compiler and runtime
support and to minimize implementation divergence.  To maximize reuse of the
OpenMP implementation and to facilitate research and development into new
source-level tools involving both the OpenACC and OpenMP levels, Clacc
implements this translation in the Clang AST using Clang's TreeTransform
facility.  However, we are also following LLVM IR parallel extensions being
developed by the community as a path to improve compiler optimizations and
analyses.</p><p>The purpose of this talk is to provide an update on Clacc progress over the
preceding year including early performance results, to present the plan for the
year ahead, and to invite participation from others.  Clacc's OpenACC
support is still maturing and we have not yet offered it upstream.  However, we
have already upstreamed many mutually beneficial improvements from the Clacc
project, including improvements to LLVM's testing infrastructure and to
Clang and its OpenMP support.  This talk will summarize those contributions as
well.</p><p>[1] OpenACC standard: <a href="https://www.openacc.org/">https://www.openacc.org/</a></p><p>[2] Clacc: Translating OpenACC to OpenMP in Clang.  Joel E. Denny, Seyong
