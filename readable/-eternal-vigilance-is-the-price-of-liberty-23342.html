		<p>Those that know me well will know that I hold privacy and liberty of the individual as one of my core principles. I believe we are entitled, as part of our human rights, to go about our lives without intrusion from either the government, business or individuals.</p>
<p>In the UK, we are subject to pervasive surveillance by CCTV, ANPR, and other monitoring technologies. The government, media and police attempt to use a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2015/responding-to-nothing-to-hide-nothing-to-fear">nothing to hide, nothing to fear</a>‚Äù mantra to convince the public that these technologies are effective and have little downside. Unfortunately, the cost-benefit of many of these systems has not been demonstrated. Even if it were, the costs would be purely tangible ones ‚Äì install, maintenance and operating costs ‚Äì ignoring the impact it can have on our personal wellbeing. Over time, we become used to this surveillance and accept it without question.</p>
<p>Recent rises in crime, along with reduced police resources, have triggered community crime-fighting efforts. <a href="https://www.ourwatch.org.uk/">Neighbourhood Watch</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shomrim_(neighborhood_watch_group)">volunteer patrols</a> are often suggested and can have positive effects.</p>
<p>But a recent post on a Facebook group proposed a system that could invade privacy, would not comply with data protection law, could place homeowner‚Äôs networks at risk of attack, and has no demonstrated impact on crime levels.</p>
<p>Initially, I was willing to put this down to naivet√© and a ‚Äúanything-is-better-than-nothing‚Äù attitude, but it soon because clear that these were not the issue here.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a closed group and I can‚Äôt just link to it. I hope that the following excerpts are representative of the whole.</p>
<p><img src="https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-11-at-18.52.54.png" alt="" width="996" height="998" srcset="https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-11-at-18.52.54.png 996w, https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-11-at-18.52.54-150x150.png 150w, https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-11-at-18.52.54-300x300.png 300w, https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-11-at-18.52.54-768x770.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px"></p>
<p>I‚Äôll summarise this, and subsequent posts:</p>
<blockquote><p>To reduce crime, a network of Raspberry Pi based automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras would be installed. This would in the area of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxted">small town</a> and would be operated outside of GDPR or any other data protection laws. The cameras would be located at knee-height on the perimeter of private properties, filming public roads.</p>
<p>Residents pay to install and operate the system. Residents can prevent their vehicles from being logged by registering their number plate with the system. This would require sending a V5 document or an image of the car in the driveway.</p>
<p>In the event of a crime, the list of unregistered plates would be used somehow. There is also suggestion that alerts could be raised on ‚Äúbad‚Äù plates.</p>
<p>There is proposed expansion to record WiFi and Bluetooth identifiers alongside number plates.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a number of serious concerns around this scheme.</p>
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>Elliot wishes to operate the scheme outside of current data protection laws.</p>
<p>He has made several incorrect or questionable claims here.</p>

<p>It seems to have been accepted by Elliott that recording images of people would mean the system would fall under GDPR.</p>
<p>There are a number of claims that need examining.</p>
<p>Firstly, it‚Äôs highly unlikely the cameras will only gather number plates. Whilst some ANPR cameras have a limited FOV and are virtually useless at capturing images of people, this is not the case here. They are <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/night-vision-camera-module-for-raspberry-pi?variant=12516582752339">general purpose, wide-angle cameras</a> mounted at knee-height. If you stand 3m away from this camera, you will be captured from head-to-foot. The chance that a significant network of cameras does not capture images of people is vanishingly small.</p>
<p>Secondly, the notion that number plates do not constitute personal information is false. The ICO <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2009/494046/FS_50186040.pdf">ruled on this</a> in 2009: vehicle registrations of vehicles owned by individuals are personal information.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the camera network gathers more than just a number plate. There is also the time and location over a network of cameras, providing a route. This makes the information even more likely to lead to an individual being identified.</p>
<p>Fourthly, to register your car on the system, you are required to send your V5 or an image of the car in a driveway. This is certainly personal data.</p>
<p>Elliott was challenged about this. Rather than accept that the system may need to handle the data under GDPR, he doubled down around the V5s and images of cars in a drive.</p>
<p><img src="https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-12-at-20.20.57.png" alt="" width="850" height="380" srcset="https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-12-at-20.20.57.png 850w, https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-12-at-20.20.57-300x134.png 300w, https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-12-at-20.20.57-768x343.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"></p>
<p><img src="https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-12-at-20.25.54.png" alt="" width="834" height="188" srcset="https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-12-at-20.25.54.png 834w, https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-12-at-20.25.54-300x68.png 300w, https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-12-at-20.25.54-768x173.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px"></p>
<p>He now tries to argue that the system isn‚Äôt being operated by an entity ‚Äì it‚Äôs just citizens sending data to each other. It seems a very odd argument, given that the operator of the system would be taking payment of ¬£50/year per camera ‚Äì that sounds a lot like central entity. More to the point, GDPR doesn‚Äôt really care if it‚Äôs a business or individual, it cares about the data being gathered.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Elliott is proposing a system that would gather other people‚Äôs data and that these people <strong>would not have any of their <a href="https://sozodesign.co.uk/blog/gdpr/gdpr-2018-the-8-individual-s-rights/">rights</a> under GDPR</strong>. They would <strong>not</strong> be informed, they would <strong>not</strong> have the right to access, and they would <strong>not</strong> have the right to erasure.</p>
<p>To make things worse, the scope creeps to include Bluetooth and WiFi data gathering. Now your phone and smart watch will be tracked by the same system.</p>
<p><img src="https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-12-at-21.07.10.png" alt="" width="834" height="486" srcset="https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-12-at-21.07.10.png 834w, https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-12-at-21.07.10-300x175.png 300w, https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-12-at-21.07.10-768x448.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px"></p>
<p>Without the controls that data protection laws provide, who knows what the data will be used for?</p>
<h3>Information Security</h3>
<p>The proposed system would place a network of Raspberry Pi‚Äôs on the networks of many homeowners.</p>
<p>I have three concerns here.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would be concerned that attackers <em>without</em> authorisation could take command of one or more of these devices remotely, viewing the cameras, injecting false data, or attacking the homeowner‚Äôs networks. IoT security isn‚Äôt easy, and I have seen many Raspberry Pi based systems fail badly and fail hard.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would be concerned that someone <em>with</em> authorisation to access the devices could attack the homeowner‚Äôs networks. Given that the system is operating outside of data protection laws, and that it isn‚Äôt operated by a company or entity, how do you know who has access to the devices? What controls have they put in place to protect you? What comeback would you have?</p>
<p>Thirdly, what would happen if one of the devices was stolen? What access would this permit the attacker? I often see credentials from a single device permit access to many more.</p>
<h3>Efficacy</h3>
<p>It is stated that the system will avoid capturing anything except images of number plates. As a result, it won‚Äôt actually capture images of crimes. It will just know which vehicles had been in the area at a given time.</p>
<p>If a crime occurs, all the system will be able to provide is a list of number plates of vehicles in the area. This list will contain residents who have not been registered, visitors, people passing through, vehicles that have not been registered as leaving due to coverage, and maybe the vehicle the criminal used.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure what this list will be used for.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure what the police would do with a list like this.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs certainly not obvious that it will provide <em>any</em> benefit.</p>
<p>Essentially, anyone with the audacity to enter the Oxted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_and_Environmental_Zone">ring-of-steel</a> will become a suspect.</p>
<p>If 100 cameras are installed, then it will cost ¬£5,000 to install, and ¬£5,000/year to operate ‚Äì ¬£30,000 over 5 years. Is it going to provide value compared to other options?</p>
<p>I‚Äôd want something more than an appeal-to-emotion to justify installing such a system.</p>
<p>Ironically, if the system gathered images of people and crimes, it would probably be of more use.</p>
<h3>Attitude</h3>
<p>There is the explicit admission that he will try to avoid GDPR.</p>
<p><img src="https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-13-09_28_17-1-Oxted.png" alt="" width="838" height="151" srcset="https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-13-09_28_17-1-Oxted.png 838w, https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-13-09_28_17-1-Oxted-300x54.png 300w, https://cybergibbons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-13-09_28_17-1-Oxted-768x138.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px"></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Data protection law is often maligned. It isn‚Äôt the evil beast that many make it out to be.</p>
<p>Entities that comply with data protection law have normally considered what data they gather, and how they will protect it.</p>
<p>Those that don‚Äôt comply with data protection law often gather more than they need and don‚Äôt adequately protect it, likely because they don‚Äôt think any of the penalties can apply to them.</p>
<p>GDPR doesn‚Äôt exist to stop people implementing ANPR systems; it exists to allow those surveilled by such a system to know what happens with the data.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs often less effort to comply with the law than it is to skirt around it.</p>
<p>Ask yourself why Elliott is trying to escape these responsibilities and what impact it could have on you.</p>
