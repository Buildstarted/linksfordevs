Thank you for taking all the time you did to prepare a working solution with so many technologies.  It was evident you worked extremely hard to prepare a valuable workshop for the attendees."  -<em>William</em></p><p>"Thank you for the course. We covered maybe 12 hours worth of material in 8. What I liked most about the course was that I went from listening to people talk about Blazor to being able to code with Blazor. I will definitely be able to build on this course." <em> -Chuck</em></p><p>"Really enjoyed this course, Carl's materials and content were structured really well and Carl himself is an excellent coach. It is a really intense day with a lot to take in but I had great fun and learnâ€™t a lot. A really great day. Thanks Carl." <em>- Jonathan</em></p><p><strong>Additional workshop dates:</strong></p><p><a href="http://vote.appvnext.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cast your vote for the date of the January 2020 class here.</a></p><p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p><p><strong>Visual Studio Installer Options:</strong></p><ul><li>- ASP.NET and web development</li><li>- Data Storage and processing</li><li>- .NET Core cross-platform development </li><li>- Go to **Individual components** and search for *localdb*.

We will build a local service to call the APIs. We will build components to handle editing records and embed those components into our SPA. We will add a SignalR hub to share immediate changes to other users working on the same records. We will  add AspNetCore.Identity and restrict access to our app and apis based on users roles. We will use IdentityManager to edit user roles.</p><p>We will use Zoom (<a href="http://zoom.us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://zoom.us</a>).
