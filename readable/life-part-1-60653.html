I never met him but by all accounts, he was a delightful person and brilliant mathematician; his charming book on introductory game theory, <em>Winning Ways</em>, is the most fun you can have reading a university level math text. I had just purchased a biography, <em>Genius at Work</em>, before the crisis began and I suppose I’ll have time to read it now.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">I’m sad, of course; we are all diminished when we lose a delightful and brilliant teacher. I’m also angry at the frankly disgusting attitude I see in the media and in the actions of elected officials that it is somehow no great loss to society when a disease predominantly kills the elderly. Scrooge’s <em>they had better die and reduce the surplus population</em> was meant to be taken as the horrifyingly Malthusian ranting of a bitter, foolish man who ought to know better, not as words to live by.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">But I don’t intend this to be <a href="https://ericlippert.com/2020/03/24/bandits-victims-and-idiots/">another rant as to the utter, abject, criminal stupidity</a> that has informed the response to this pandemic. Rather: I have been wanting for over a decade to write a series on my blog about Conway’s most famous invention (I almost said <em>discovery</em>, because it seems like such a natural part of my world), Conway’s Game of Life. Now seems like a good time.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">When I was a teenager I collected back issues of Scientific American — mostly from the sadly now gone Casablanca Books in my home town. Lots of the articles were interesting, but mostly I wanted a set of all the Martin Gardener, Kee Dewdeny and Douglas Hofstadter’s monthly columns on mathematics and programming.</p>
<hr>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">ASIDE: A note to any teenagers reading this who are collecting bulky old stuff like me. <strong>Keep it.</strong> When I moved across country I took my National Geographics and Tolkien biographies, but I sold my SciAms and Doctor Who novelizations for pennies on the dollar because they were bulky and I figured I wouldn’t miss them. And now only 25 years later I wish I still had those memorabilia.</p>
<hr>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">I kept photocopies of Gardener’s articles on Life in 1970 and 1971 that introduced the phenomenon to the world. I find it fascinating to think about how Conway and the other people who made initial discoveries must have worked, without fast computers and fancy graphics; Conway said in the original 1970 article “it is marvelous to sit watching on the computer screen”, so there must have been some graphical system, but I can only imagine that it was quite primitive.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Over the next few weeks I’ll recapitulate my own experience with Life, though with much better hardware, software, and coding skills than my initial forays on my Amiga 500 as a teenager. We’ll start with the basics and work our way up to an astonishing result: it is possible to compute trillions of generations per second on Life boards with trillions of cells using an ordinary desktop computer.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Early exposure to Life made me think about programming in ways I had not before, and I am grateful to John Conway for giving me and so many others that inspiration.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Next time on FAIC:</strong> We’ll begin at the beginning with the rules of the game and some straightforward implementations.</p>
