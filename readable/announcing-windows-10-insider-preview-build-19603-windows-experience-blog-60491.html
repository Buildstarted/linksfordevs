</ul>

<ul>
<li>We are removing <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4526620/">the known issue for incompatibility issues</a> due to changes in the operating system between some Insider Preview builds and certain versions of BattlEye anti-cheat software. If you run into issues playing games that use BattlEye anti-cheat software, please submit feedback on these issues to us via <a href="https://home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feedback Hub</a>.</li>

<li>We fixed an issue that led to inaccurate size estimates for disk cleanup when the option to clean up old Windows installation files was included.</li>

<li>We fixed an issue that could result in Settings crashing when navigating to Network &amp; Internet for some Insiders.</li>

<li>We are aware Narrator and NVDA users that seek the latest release of Microsoft Edge based on Chromium may experience some difficulty when navigating and reading certain web content. Narrator, NVDA and the Edge teams are aware of these issues. Users of legacy Microsoft Edge will not be affected. NVAccess has released a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/post/nvda-2019-3-released/">NVDA 2019.3</a> that resolves the known issue with Edge.</li>
<li>We’re looking into reports of the update process hanging for extended periods of time when attempting to install a new build.</li>
<li>The Documents section under Privacy has a broken icon (just a rectangle).</li>
<li>Sticky Notes windows can’t be moved on the desktop. As a workaround, when you set focus to Sticky Notes, press Alt + Space. This will bring up a menu that contains a Move option. Select it, then use either the arrow keys or the mouse to move the window.</li>
<li>We’re investigating reports that app icons in the taskbar are having rendering issues, including defaulting to the .exe icon.</li>
<li>We’re investigating reports that the battery icon on the lock screen always shows close to empty, regardless of actual battery levels.</li>
<li>We’re investigating reports of IIS configuration being set to default after taking a new build. You will need to back up your IIS configuration and restore it after the new build is installed successfully.</li>
<li>Language packs may fail to install on this build. This is most impactful for anyone who chooses to reset their PC – the language packs you have prior to upgrading will persist. Anyone impact by this may notice some parts of the UI don’t display in your preferred language.</li>
<li><strong>[ADDED]</strong> Quickly switching between WSL distros using the file explorer integration could cause a transient access error. We’ve identified the cause of this issue and are releasing a fix soon.</li>
