They are also told to cancel events promoting combat or third-person shooter games, avoid showing violent movies or hunting season videos, and remove any product referencing combat or third-person shooters.</p><p>Walmart appears to be taking these actions following two recent shooting events in or near its stores. The first shooting took place on July 30 at a Walmart in Southaven, Mississippi, where an employee <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/southaven-walmart-shooting-mississippi-suspect-identified-martez-abram-today-2019-07-30/">killed two coworkers</a> and injured a police officer before being arrested. The second took place on August 3 at an El Paso, Texas Walmart where a gunman killed 22 and wounded 24 before being taken into custody. The latter is believed to be the author of a manifesto published online ahead of the shooting that included racist diatribes, hate speech, and white supremacist beliefs.</p><p>Though the retailer also sells firearms and has been called upon to remove guns from its stores following the shootings, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/05/walmart-not-halting-gun-sales-despite-calls-advocates-do-so/1920090001/">the company has said it will not change its policy</a>.</p><p>Following the El Paso shooting and another shooting in Dayton, Ohio over the weekend, President Donald Trump has suggested that "gruesome, grisly video games" may be at fault for the events despite no evidence suggesting a connection. Both the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-08-06-igda-igdaf-issues-statement-on-weekend-shootings-in-the-us">IGDA</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-08-06-esa-defends-against-trumps-proposed-video-game-crackdown">ESA</a> have issued responses noting the lack of evidence linking video games to violence, and noting that while video games are played worldwide, the US is unique in its frequent mass shootings.</p></div></div></div></div>
