          <p>To start, I think it's worth contextualizing where we are now. F# (at least within VS) is about where Roslyn was when this issue was filed in 2015: <a data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="119019306" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/7082" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/roslyn/issues/7082/hovercard" href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/7082">dotnet/roslyn#7082</a></p>
<p>To summarize that long thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were some memory leaks that were tricky to uncover, and these affected people</li>
<li>Everything was running in the same 32-bit VS process, and even with memory leaks fixed, there was simply too much stuff going on</li>
<li>"Roslyn 2.0" (quotes since that was never an actual name), set for VS 2017, would have a tweaked architecture compared with VS 2015 to address the second point</li>
</ul>
<p>Ionide and Rider use an out of process model for hosting FCS, but some of the fundamentals aren't much different. The working set can get huge in both IDEs, especially for larger solutions, and it's not uncommon to hear about 10+ GB of RAM being used. Many operations can be slow, and the fact that they're out of process doesn't make a difference.</p>
<p>As you're likely aware, we made a lot of changes to the compiler that aligned with VS 2019 GA after careful measurement of traces from users and our own dogfooding. Although there's still two issues left - boxing of <code>range</code>s any time <code>hash</code> is called on it and LOH allocations with the <code>LexBuffer</code> - the big problems were resolved.</p>
<p>After the past 1.5 weeks of analyzing memory dumps and traces from a big internal solution under various loads, we've found two memory leaks - one of which is VS-specific and fixed, and the other we'll queue up a fix for (it also requires a change in the TPSDK, since that thing reflects into the internals of the compiler...). We also found a data structure that could be turned into a struct, saving up to 30MB of the working set for a given process using FCS. But barring any further findings, we're pretty much at the point where we need to consider a re-architecture for the F# tools in VS, and this will certainly affect Ionide and other tools as it will likely involve FCS to some degree.</p>
<p>Roslyn adopted an approach similar to what you write in your notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various features areas are now out of process components (example: <a data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="117570592" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/6846" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/roslyn/issues/6846/hovercard" href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/6846">dotnet/roslyn#6846</a>). Analyzers were a big one to be out of process, because there are some that do full solution analysis, which is quite heavy.</li>
<li>Not every individual feature has its own process. It's based on architecture. As per the linked issue, IDE diagnostics are in the same process; there isn't a single process for each analyzer.</li>
<li>"64-bit all the things!" ... not really. Since 64-bit means every pointer is double the size, that matters for people using machines like laptops with less RAM. Just for reference, we measured a ~1.5x increase in memory usage with a prototype we have internally, so 64-bit &lt;&gt; better; such a thing should be based on measurements and not "because 64 bit is better".</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all is rosy in this world, though. There was a tremendously long tail of bugs that the Roslyn team had dealt with; nearly a year's worth of them. As it turns out, communicating information between N processes is challenging, and there are additional perf considerations regarding IPC. If any one person thinks they could do this themselves, just know that a team where people each at 5+ years of experience building these sorts of things dealt with issues for nearly a year. It's a huge undertaking. Frankly, it's a hell of a lot easier to have one monolithic .dll be responsible for everything if you can get away with it.</p>
<p><strong>Improving FCS</strong></p>
<p>To avoid a similar tail of bugs, I think it's best to focus on improving FCS itself before multiple processes are considered.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why it worked out fairly well for Roslyn, despite the tail of bugs, is that Roslyn itself operates with an immutable snapshot model. When you invoke a feature, the known universe is quickly calculated with a compilation snapshot and everything is based entirely on that. If you take another snapshot and it's different than the previous one, the previous is discarded and the new snapshot is the known universe. If they're the same, then barely any work is done. FCS attempts to cache things that have been already figured out (see IncrementalBuilder.fs for more detail, though good luck in trying to understand its contents). However, in practice it is nowhere near as good as Roslyn's model due to the fact that files are re-checked all of the time.</p>
<p>Additionally, this model allows Roslyn to speculate on if certain work even needs to be done. For data flowing between cross-project references, Roslyn will speculate if things have changed based on the semantic meaning behind operations you perform. FCS has no ability to do this, so if you have a relatively deep chain of project-to-project references, changes will incur a typecheck of all dependent projects resulting in a lot of redundant work. This makes IntelliSense <em>seem</em> unreliably time-consuming when you make changes across multiple files.</p>
<p>Beyond what you mentioned about having a priority queue, FCS itself may need to adopt a snapshot model similar to Roslyn. Perhaps there are other alternatives, but the model has kept things sane in their enormous codebase, and because it allows certain speculation that's rather cheap to perform, IDE features can be pretty quick and consistent regardless of what you did prior to a particular action.</p>
<p>Additionally, a snapshot model like what Roslyn uses makes managing N processes significantly simpler. If all you do is work on the known universe that was computed (and compare against the last known universe efficiently), there isn't much complication in keeping things synchronized. The universe is what it is, and that's all there is to it. Failing to have a simplifying mechanism like this would spaghettify code and make N processes horribly difficult to manage properly.</p>
<p><strong>Type Providers</strong></p>
<p>Type Providers are a big problem. For those who aren't ware, ProvidedTypes.fs is an ad-hoc copy-paste of pieces of the F# compiler that has been further modified to accommodate the needs of type providers. You can think of every type provider library as being packaged up with its own fork of the compiler, and that fork does things subtly differently than whatever compiler a user is using.</p>
<p>This has serious performance ramifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expensive operations like reading IL are done twice. The F# compiler does it, but so does the type provider. We've observed many dumps and traces where IL reading was a significant contributor to memory and CPU usage, and doubling that is simply bad for performance</li>
<li>Information that the F# compiler has already calculated is re-calculated redundantly. For example, determining where mscorlib is located, or what version of FSharp.Core is being compiled against. The F# compiler already knows this information, but it's re-calculated all of the time.</li>
<li>The architecture of FCS, which does enormous amounts of re-checking files when you modify them, means that the previous two points come into play again and again and again. There have been some efforts to attempt to cache things, but one of the <em>trial</em> solutions that was merged is actually a memory leak. So as of this moment, any type provider that uses an up to date TPSDK has a memory leak in it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, changing things in the F# compiler can cause downstream breaking changes for any consumer of type providers. This is because ProvidedTypes.fs <em>also</em> reflects into the internals of the F# compiler that is hosting the type provider. We realized this when we were working on a fix for a known memory leak. Fixing it would break any type provider loaded with a newer compiler.</p>
<p>What this means is to that fixes to the F# compiler have the potential to inadvertently break anyone using a type provider. Although this isn't going to happen very often, it can happen, and it will require all type provider authors to update their dependencies any time it will happen. This will be the case when we fix the known memory leak we found.</p>
<p>This is not a sustainable model at all, so there are two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage people to not use type providers except for the purposes of data exploration and scripting</li>
<li>Change the architecture of the TPSDK and F# compiler such that the TPSDK is merely an API into the F# compiler, rather than an API into the <em>fork</em> of the F# compiler that resides inside the TPSDK</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is untenable, but the latter also means that any time we ship an updated compiler, all type provider authors must update their dependencies. It also means that any consumer of type providers who does not update their dependencies could be broken just by updating their tool set.</p>
<p>An additional wrinkle here is that the TPSDK is neither owned, maintained, nor contributed to by Microsoft. We have no authority over it, yet it affects people using F# (and VS). We'll contribute back to it if we can, but if we must make a change before a release and doing so would break Type Providers, we will make that change and break Type Providers. Although they are part of the F# spec, none of their implementation is actually in our codebase. And we have no support obligation for any component that reflects into the internals of our systems. So, an additional approach we could take from the Microsoft perspective is to make the changes we need to make F# and FCS great, and say, "that's just too bad" if type providers break. I'd prefer not to have that happen, but it's being considered.</p>
