The data is used to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars nationally — including hundreds of millions to Baltimore City — for health, housing, education and other programs.</p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p>"The census directly affects federal funding for things like this public health emergency we find ourselves in now,” Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said Wednesday, referring to the coronavirus pandemic.</p></div>  <div data-type="text"> <p>Baltimore City’s self-response rate is 31.8%, compared to 40.2% for the state and 38.4% nationally, according to the bureau’s online database. The gap is more pronounced for people completing their forms online — 24.2% for Baltimore, 37.5% for the state, and 33.8% for the nation.</p></div>   <div data-type="text"> <p>The bureau says to count everyone “where they ordinarily would be living" Wednesday, even if they are not there now because of the coronavirus or other reasons.</p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p data-item-type="depthscroll" data-item-id="depth_scroll_middle" data-item-number="middle">Although Wednesday is called “Census Day," it is not a deadline for completing forms. Rather, the bureau simply encourages people “to respond as soon as you can.” By law, it has until the end of the year to deliver counts to the president and Congress.</p></div>  <div data-type="text"> <p>Howard and Carroll counties have so far recorded the highest response rate of Baltimore-area counties — 48.2% for Howard and 47.8% for Carroll. Baltimore County’s rate was 41.4%, Anne Arundel’s was 43.6% and Harford’s was 45.2%.</p></div>     <div data-type="newsletter-promo-card" data-pb-id="inline-newsletter-card"> <div><div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div>  <div> <div> <p> <h2>Breaking News Alerts Newsletter</h2> </p> <p>As it happens</p>  <p>Get updates on the coronavirus pandemic and other news as it happens with our free breaking news email alerts.</p> </div> </div> </div>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div></div> </div> <div data-type="text"> <p>“We’re in a challenging time,” said state Del. Stephanie Smith, a Baltimore Democrat who joined Young on Wednesday in encouraging broad participation. “But it’s still an opportunity for us to count every neighbor that we have so that we can get our fair share of federal dollars that make sure we can feed the most vulnerable at a time like this, that make sure our seniors get the support they need at a time like this.”</p></div>  <div data-type="text"> <p>The census also is used to redraw congressional districts to reflect population shifts and to determine how many members states get in the U.S. House of Representatives</p></div> <div data-type="text"> <p data-role="intersectionobserver">Given the coronavirus-related delays, U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Montgomery County Democrat, and other members of the House Oversight and Reform Committee have asked the bureau to respond to written questions about its plans “to prevent any disruption” to the census and to participate in a video briefing within the next week.</p></div>   <div data-type="text"> <div> <p data-item-type="depthscroll" data-item-id="depth_scroll_bottom" data-item-number="bottom"><i>Baltimore Sun reporter Talia Richman contributed to this article</i></p>   </div></div> </div> </div></div></div>
