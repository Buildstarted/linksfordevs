<p>As we lurch erratically and haphazardly toward a new world order&nbsp;that finally subsumes the dilapidated remnants of the Cold War era, here are&nbsp;the current players in the great game: SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 – what an incredible Cinderella story. This unknown virus, a mere 29,903 nucleotides, comes out of nowhere, to disrupt the entire planet and intensify the … <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/03/the-geopolitical-game-board-march-2020/">Continue reading <span>The Geopolitical Game Board – March 2020</span></a></p> </div>

That fascination turned into an early … <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2019-edition/">Continue reading <span>Follow the CAPEX: Cloud Table Stakes 2019 Edition</span></a></p> </div>

<p>TL;DR: Down and to the right I wasn’t going to do this post until I learned IBM PR is out browbeating reporters (one of the rare activities where the company is still world class) for being “too harsh” by including actual performance metrics in stories about IBM’s CEO transition.
