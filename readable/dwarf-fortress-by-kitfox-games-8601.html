Generated rise and fall of civilizations, personalities, creatures, cultures, etc. Infinite hours of gameplay.</li><li>Now with graphics and music!&nbsp;(Optional ASCII mode available.)</li><li>A lifetime ‚Äúliving‚Äù project - created/updated since 2003, with no end in sight</li><li>Generate your unique world and manage a bustling colony of dwarves, even as they probably mine towards their eventual demise.</li><li>Optional ADVENTURER MODE: explore the generated world as a single hero in an RPG</li><li>Optional LEGENDS MODE: read the history of the generated world and your games in it</li><li>A new endless hobby, just for you!</li></ul>

<p>Prepare for the deepest, most intricate simulation of a world that has ever been created. The legendary Dwarf Fortress is now on itch.io, and you must build a fortress and try to survive, despite threats of starvation, dragons, and madness.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzE5Mjc2MTMucG5n/original/p1E006.png"><br></p>
<p>In this complex construction/management/roguelike simulation, every generated world brings a unique challenge, whether it‚Äôs dwarves with their own simulated personalities or aquifers. Observe what makes your fortress fall into eventual decline, and learn for next time‚Ä¶ until something else inevitably goes wrong.</p>
<p>The combat model includes skills, body parts, material properties, aimed attacks, wrestling, pain, nausea, various poison effects, and much more.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs difficult to convey the depth of the generation. Hundreds of animals and monsters, many of which are randomly created for each world, as well as generated poetry, musical forms, instruments, and dances for your dwarves to practice and perform. A dynamic weather model tracks wind, humidity, and air masses to create fronts, clouds, storms, and blizzards. Over two hundred rock and mineral types can appear, in their proper geological environments.</p>
<p>Remember: Losing is fun!</p>

<p>Nothing substantial has changed, under the hood. It‚Äôs still good old Dwarf Fortress. A few bells and whistles won‚Äôt change that.</p>
<p>You may already be familiar with the tile set mod packs from Micha≈Ç ‚ÄúMayday‚Äù Madej and Patrick Martin ‚ÄúMeph‚Äù Schroeder. They‚Äôre collaborating on an all-new, from-scratch tileset, as seen in the trailer and screenshots. Meanwhile, Dabu has composed a few musical tracks, to match the seasons.</p>
