<p>So, in the excuse of an indie game, the goal is to complete each level without being shot by the INCREDIBLY accurate guards. The game is fairly easy once you know what to do - it's about using "stealth" (not exactly) and your abilities to get past the guards. The abilities are mind control and seeing through walls. There's ragdolls, a gun, and a scanner thing.</p>

<p>It has a speedrun clock too!</p>
