                    <div>
                    <p>These courses are designed for students in arts, social sciences, and sciences.</p>
                        <p>No previous computer programming experience or university-level mathematics courses are assumed or required.</p>
                            <p>The visual style of lecture examples and assignments are especially well-suited to visual thinkers and creative individuals.</p>

                    <p>Learning to code has many benefits!</p>

                    <!-- <p class="largeem">- 1 -</p>  -->
                        <p>You’ll learn to think “algorithmically,” meaning you’ll be more methodical when solving real world problems.</p>
                       <!--  <p class="largeem">- 2 -</p>  -->
                        <p>Understanding code will increase your digital literacy, making you more effective and marketable for almost any career.</p>
                        <!-- <p class="largeem">- 3 -</p> --> 
                        <p>You’ll be able to write short programs to process all kinds of data, create simple information visualizations, and prototype interactive designs.
                            <!-- <p class="largeem">- 4 -</p>  -->
                        </p><p>You’ll learn universal concepts that provide a pathway to learning even more about computers and coding.</p>

                    <h4>are these courses like?</h4>
                    <div>
                    <p>These are predominantly hands-on courses with almost weekly labs and assignments. The only way to learn to code is by coding! There's also a midterm and final exam. </p>
                    <p>CS 105 introduces basic coding concepts (like variables, program state, events, conditionals, iteration, arrays, and objects).</p>
                    <p>CS 106 applies these concepts to input/output, user interfaces, physics and animation, procedural content generation, object-oriented programming, and data processing.</p>

                    <h4>What computer language will I use?</h4>
                    <p>Both courses use <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, a popular, open-source programming environment designed from the ground up for creating interactive media.</p>

                    <h4>Why learn Processing?</h4>
                    <p>Processing is an extended version of Java, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It's conceptually similar to other popular languages like Python, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and C++.</p>

                    <h4>Can I use my own computer?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, Processing is available for Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX, and Linux. It's free to download and simple to install. It does not require the "latest and greatest" computer. </p>

                    <p>Not a lot, but some. You should be comfortable with  basic concepts like negative numbers, decimals, inequalities (e.g. greater-than and less-than), coordinates, and elementary algebra (e.g. if 3 × x = 6, what is x?).</p>

                    <p>We're not going to lie and say they're easy: learning a new skill requires effort. We do our best to make the content approachable and interesting. The courses are very well supported with lots of lab time staffed by several TAs, extra office hours from instructors and TAs, study materials, Piazza, etc.</p>

                    <p>These courses are not intended as a way into a Computer Science major or minor (students in the Faculty of Mathematics aren't even permitted to enrol). For highly motivated students who do extremely well, there may be a way into Computer Science programs. <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current-undergraduate-students/academic-advisors">Talk to a CS advisor.</a></p>
