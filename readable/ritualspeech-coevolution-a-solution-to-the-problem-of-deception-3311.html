It is now widely accepted that no other theoretical framework has equivalent potential to solve the major outstanding problems in human origins research. Rival paradigms from the human and social sciences — Freudian, Piagetian, Chomskyan, Lévi-Straussian — cannot explain evolved human mentality because they already assume this as a basic premise. Tried and tested as a methodology applicable to the social behaviour of all living organisms (Dawkins 1976; Hamilton 1964; Trivers 1985), Darwinism makes no such assumptions, thereby avoiding circularity. Modern Darwinism seeks to harmonize research into human life with the rest of scientific knowledge. This project depends, however, on accounting for the emergence of symbolic culture, including speech, a system of communication unparalleled elsewhere in biology. While Darwinians confidently expect an explanation (Pinker &amp; Bloom 1990), it has to be admitted that, to date, no compelling account has been advanced. In this chapter, I treat speech as a revolutionary development made possible by the establishment of novel levels of social co-operation. In this, I follow Maynard Smith and Szathmáry (1995), who provide a Darwinian game-theoretic perspective on the origins of human social co- operation, including speech. They view the momentous process as one of a limited number of 'major transitions' during life's evolution on Earth. Each such transition is revolutionary in that it involves a relatively sudden and dramatic restructuring, like the breaking of a log-jam.

Theoretical linguis<span></span>ts have </p><p>traditionally <span></span>avoided <span></span>the problems by simply <span>assuming</span> the existence of a </p><p>homogenous speec<span></span>h-community,<span></span> committed to the co-operative, honest </p><p>sharing of <span></span>in<span></span>formation.

While speech indeed </p><p>presupposes<span></span> social <span></span>co-operation (Grice 1969, 1975), such models distract </p><p>attention fr<span></span>om<span></span> precisely the problems which, to a D<span></span>arwinian, <span></span>most cry out<span></span> </p><p>to be addr<span></span>es<span></span>sed. Why, in the human case, can such anomalous<span></span> levels of </p><p>co-operation be <span></span>as<span></span>sumed? </p><p>The value of Darwinian <span></span>theo<span></span>ry is that it forces us to consider the barriers </p><p>to the establishment of <span></span>co<span></span>-operation on the necessary scale<span></span>. <span></span>In<span></span> a </p><p>Darwinian world, indivi<span></span>duals who<span></span> deceive others to make selfish gains, or </p><p>who ‘f<span></span>ree-<span></span>load’ — enjoying the benefits of society while evading the </p><p>costs — are likely <span></span>to<span></span> have higher fitness than co-operators (Axelrod &amp; </p><p>Hamilton 1981; Tri<span></span>vers 1971<span></span>). Attempts to solve this<span></span> problem <span></span>by<span></span> </p><p>modelling ever-hi<span></span>gher<span></span> benefits from co-operation are self-defeating: the </p><p>greater the <span></span>benefits,<span></span> the greater the gains made by any free-loader who </p><p>can still reap t<span></span>hes<span></span>e while avoiding the costs.

As conflict intensifies, signals </p><p>become restricted to <span></span>displays<span></span> of fighting or other competitive ability. </p><p>Such signals are uninformative except in one narr<span></span>o<span></span>w respect: they reveal </p><p>the signaller’s ability to meet the costs of t<span></span>he<span></span> display. The more </p><p>discernibly costly the signal, the mor<span></span>e<span></span> impressive it is (Zahavi 1987). As </p><p>receivers incur f<span></span>itness<span></span> penalties for being too impress<span></span>ionable, all <span></span>but the </p><p>most costly, elaborate, repetitive <span></span>and<span></span> ‘ritual’-like signals are simply </p><p>ignored. The dynamic <span></span>culm<span></span>inates in extravagant advertisements<span></span> such as </p><p>peacock displays<span></span> or <span></span>the roars of rutting caribou bulls. </p><p>Where interests converge, however, this dynamic is<span></span> set into <span></span>reverse. </p><p>Instead of r<span></span>esis<span></span>ting and checking out all incoming signals<span></span>, r<span></span>eceivers can </p><p>now affor<span></span>d<span></span> to minimize response times, acting on trust. Signals t<span></span>hen<span></span> </p><p>evolve to become less repetitive and ‘ri<span></span>tualized’<span></span>, more cryptic, quiet and </p><p>efficient. Signals may <span></span>now<span></span> take more effort to detect and decode, but if </p><p>the infor<span></span>mation<span></span> is valuable, receivers should be motivated to invest that </p><p>effort. T<span></span>h<span></span>is allows signallers to offload costs of communication onto </p><p>receivers — minimi<span></span>zing<span></span> redundancy, lowering amplitude and narrowing </p><p>the range of utili<span></span>zed channels<span></span>. The outcome is what Krebs &amp; <span></span>Dawkins<span></span> </p><p>call ‘conspiratorial <span></span>whispering<span></span>’. Social insects communicating within </p><p>well-defended colonies off<span></span>er<span></span> examples of such highly informative </p><p>‘whispering’. </p><p>In the <span></span>animal<span></span> world, however, the process of cost-c<span></span>utting comes up </p><p>against constraints. Where whole local <span></span>populations<span></span> are concerned, </p><p>interests rarely converge except i<span></span>n<span></span> relation to a narrow range of </p><p>challenges<span></span> such as external thr<span></span>eats. Even in this context, any build-up of </p><p>mutual tr<span></span>ust wil<span></span>l simultaneously offer scope for chea<span></span>ting. <span></span>The disc<span></span>rete, </p><p>species<span></span>-specific <span></span>anti-predator alarms of vervet monkeys<span></span>, <span></span>for example, are </p><p>occas<span></span>ionally used deceptively against conspecifics. <span></span>On hearing an alarm, </p><p>correspondingly, <span></span>vervets do<span></span> not behave as if wholly trusting; t<span></span>hey<span></span> scan </p><p>the horizon ‘as if <span></span>they<span></span> were searching for additional cues, both from the </p><p>source of the <span></span>alarm<span></span> call and elsewhere’ (Cheney &amp; Seyfarth 1990: 107). </p><p>Admittedly, <span></span>vervet<span></span> alarms are honest by default: they would not work </p><p>otherwise.

Suppose certain </p><p>unusually intelligent chimps in a wild population develop a repertoir<span></span>e<span></span> of </p><p>volitional vocal signals, <span></span>eac<span></span>h with a conventional meaning. Ent<span></span>e<span></span>rprising </p><p>animals will soon be using <span></span>these<span></span> in tactically decei<span></span>ving each other (Byrne </p><p>&amp; Whiten 1985). Emission costs will be <span></span>low<span></span>, making even small gains </p><p>worthwhile, <span></span>put<span></span>ting pressure on all to deceive where possible. On that </p><p>basis, ingroup t<span></span>rust<span></span> will rapidly be exhausted, to the point where <span></span>no<span></span>-one is </p><p>listening any more; the system will <span></span>now<span></span> be useless for any pur<span></span>pose,<span></span> </p><p>honest or dishonest. Z<span></span>ahavi<span></span> (1993) concludes that, s<span></span>ince potential </p><p>conflicts of <span></span>inte<span></span>rest exist throughout the animal wo<span></span>rld,<span></span> even<span></span> between </p><p>close kin, r<span></span>esis<span></span>tance to deception has always selected agains<span></span>t conventional </p><p>signals — with the <span></span>one<span></span> puzzling exception of humans<span></span>. </p><p>4 <span> </span>Apes: too <span></span>clever for <span></span>words? </p><p>The pr<span></span>oblem<span></span>, then, is that conventional signals dep<span></span>end on t<span></span>rust, whereas<span></span> </p><p>those animals intelligent enough to use such signals will also be clever </p><p>enough to exploit that trust competitively. T<span></span>his<span></span> may help explain why, </p><p>despite their cognitive <span></span>capa<span></span>cities (cf. Ulbaek, this volume), chimpanzees </p><p>have no natural <span></span>use <span></span>for conventional signals. In particular, it clarifies why, </p><p>in common <span></span>with<span></span> other primates, chimps do not vocalize dispass<span></span>ionately, </p><p>lacking those capacities for cort<span></span>ical<span></span> control which appe<span></span>ar natural <span></span>in<span></span> other </p><p>contexts such as manual gesticulation (Hayes 1950). Such lack of control </p><p>should not be <span></span>se<span></span>en as maladaptive: at stake is the maintena<span></span>nce of </p><p>credibility. Chimps, li<span></span>ke<span></span> other primates, need reliable signals on which to </p><p>base their behaviour. Only <span></span>to<span></span> the extent that their vocaliza<span></span>tions remain </p><p>governed by t<span></span>he <span></span>limbic (emotional) system can listeners trust them as </p><p>reliable cues to inter<span></span>nal<span></span> states. </p><p>Admittedly, <span></span>apes<span></span> may volitionally suppress their calls. For example, on </p><p>discovering food, a chimp may with diff<span></span>iculty<span></span> conce<span></span>al its excitement, </p><p>suppress<span></span>ing the associated f<span></span>ood-call and succeeding thereby in keeping </p></div></div></div>

Sti<span></span>ll<span></span> more impressively, a group of chimps may maintain </p><p>silence for hour<span></span>s while<span></span> patrolling near a neighbouring band’s range. This </p><p>reflects a group-<span></span>wide<span></span> temporary convergence of interes<span></span>ts, the suppression </p><p>of sounds being backed with reprim<span></span>ands<span></span> (Goodall 1986: 490—491). Once </p><p>the danger is over and calls can be resumed, however, these are as usual </p><p>highly emotional. Where calculating <span></span>manipulat<span></span>ion is conce<span></span>rned, <span></span>the most </p><p>impressive chimp signals are not t<span></span>hei<span></span>r calls but the<span></span>ir <span></span>silenc<span></span>es. </p><p>For <span></span>use<span></span> in deceiving one another, however, primat<span></span>es have resources </p><p>beyond the pur<span></span>ely<span></span> vocal. In one often-cited incident, an <span></span>adoles<span></span>cent male </p><p>baboon was threatened by an <span></span>approaching<span></span> group of adults. Instead of </p><p>running, it <span></span>stood on<span></span> its hindlegs and stared into the distance, as if it had </p><p>noticed a predator. Its pursuers tur<span></span>ned<span></span> to look — and although no danger </p><p>was present, the distraction <span></span>enabled the<span></span> adolescent to escape (Byrne &amp; </p><p>Whiten 1985). In another <span></span>incident<span></span>, a female gorilla, moving with <span></span>he<span></span>r </p><p>group, <span></span>not<span></span>iced a partly concealed clump of edible vine. Pr<span></span>etending<span></span> to </p><p>have seen nothing, she stopped as if to <span></span>g<span></span>room herself. As the others </p><p>moved on, <span></span>she was<span></span> able to consume the food undisturbed (Whiten &amp; </p><p>Byrne (1988:218), <span></span>citing<span></span> Fossey). Now, it is true that tricks of this kind </p><p>would not <span></span>work<span></span> unless most such signals were reliable. But it would be a </p><p>mistake to conclude that ‘primates are <span></span>usua<span></span>lly hon<span></span>est’. T<span></span>he<span></span> truthful </p><p>versions of the <span></span>dece<span></span>ptive signals noted here — genuinely seeing a </p><p>predator, <span></span>genuinely<span></span> stopping to groom oneself — would be examples of </p><p>incidentally informative<span> functional <span></span>behaviour<span></span>, not truthful deliberate </span></p><p>signalling. T<span></span>he<span></span> trust exploited by deceivers has nothing to do with </p><p>expectations of intentional honesty. On the <span></span>cont<span></span>rary, the cues habitually </p><p>trusted as sources of inf<span></span>o<span></span>rmation are valued precise<span></span>ly in <span></span>proportion as </p><p>their inf<span></span>o<span></span>rmational content appears <span>unintentional</span>. </p><p>Humans, unlike chimps, can vocalize dispass<span></span>ionat<span></span>ely. This is clearly a </p><p>key capacity esse<span></span>ntial to <span></span>the evolution of a convention-based sys<span></span>tem of </p><p>vocal communication. <span></span>Under<span></span> what selection pressures did it emerge? We </p><p>know that it is in <span></span>deceptive use o<span></span>f signals that cortic<span></span>al control <span></span>most </p><p>decisively takes over from the li<span></span>mbic<span></span> system.

But our </p><p>problem is t<span></span>o<span></span> explain how, in the human case, vocalizations beca<span></span>me </p><p>cortically controll<span></span>ed<span></span> without becoming self-eviden<span></span>tly manipulative <span></span>and<span></span> so </p><p>resisted. </p><p>Although speech is not intrinsically reliable, conversationalists in fact </p><p>routinely gi<span></span>ve one<span></span> another the benefit of any doubt. The philosopher Paul </p><p>Grice (1969) has identifi<span></span>ed <span></span>mutual intentionality as<span></span> the heart <span></span>of human </p><p>linguistic communication. <span></span>We<span></span> humans rely not merely on unintended </p><p>truthfulness in one <span></span>another<span></span>’s signals: where we are on speaking terms, we </p><p>expect intentional honesty. It follows that wit<span></span>hout<span></span> the establis<span></span>hment </p><p>among humans of <span></span>a<span></span> new kind of honesty as a default — <span></span>habitual<span></span> honesty </p><p>in volitional <span></span>signalling<span></span> — speech could not have got off the ground. In the </p><p>human case, then, <span></span>p<span></span>recisely the most unreliable kinds<span></span> of <span></span>signals<span></span> — </p><p>namely, the <span></span>vol<span></span>itional, intentional ones — must have become adapted for </p><p>honest use. Somehow, <span></span>in<span></span> the course of human evolution, what were once </p><p>frequency-dependent tactical deceptions must have become increasingly </p><p>routine while <span></span>becoming<span></span> simultaneously harnesse<span></span>d to <span></span>a reversed social </p><p>function — <span></span>t<span></span>he group-wide sharing of good information. </p><p>Imagine a popul<span></span>ation<span></span> in which volitional signals are becoming </p><p>commonplace, thanks initially to skills in deception. <span></span>How can a<span></span> new </p><p>honest strategy invade the deceptive one and become evolutionarily </p><p>stable? An immediate problem is that any increase in the pr<span></span>opo<span></span>rtion of </p><p>trusting listeners increases the rewards to <span></span>a<span></span> liar, increas<span></span>ing the f<span></span>requency </p><p>of lyi<span></span>ng<span></span>. Yet until hearers can safely assume honesty, their stance will be </p><p>indifference<span> to volitional <span></span>signa<span></span>ls. Then, even lying <span></span>will be <span></span>a waste of<span></span> time. </span></p><p>In other words, there i<span></span>s a<span></span> threshold of honest use of conventional signals, </p><p>below which any strategy <span></span>bas<span></span>ed on such signalling remains unstable. To </p><p>achieve stability, the <span></span>hones<span></span>t strategy has to predominate decisively over </p><p>deception; yet the evoluti<span></span>onary<span></span> route to such honesty se<span></span>ems to pass </p><p>inescapa<span></span>bly across a point <span></span>at which deception is so rampant that trust in </p><p>volitional signals collapses. How can this conundrum be solved? </p><p>There ar<span></span>e <span></span>those (e.g. Konner 1982: 169) who argue that the main function </p><p>of speech was and remains lying. Such <span></span>claims <span></span>may appear persuasive; </p><p>humans routinely tailor their utter<span></span>ance<span></span>s and the information divulged </p><p>according to t<span></span>heir<span></span> audience and the effect desired. Yet this view poses as<span></span> </p><p>many problems as it <span></span>solves<span></span>.

Told by his Dorze (southern Ethiopian) </p><p>informants a <span></span>patently<span></span> unbelievable ‘fact’ — that the local leopards were </p><p>devout Christians, for example — the social anthropologist Dan Sperber </p><p>(1975: 3) suspected ‘symbolism’. <span></span>Spe<span></span>rber found this to be bor<span></span>ne<span></span> out </p><p>regularly enough to suggest a r<span></span>ule-o<span></span>f-thumb: ‘“Tha<span></span>t’s symbolic.” <span></span>Why? </p><p>Because it’s false.’ Nigel Barley (1983: 10) glossed Sperber’<span></span>s <span></span>rule as </p><p>‘This l<span></span>ooks crazy.<span></span> It must be symbolism.’ Note the implication: far from </p><p>embodying self-evident truth, symbolic culture may be better understood </p><p>as a world of <span>patent fictions</span> held collectively to be true on some deeper </p><p>level. </p><p>Myths, dramatic perf<span></span>o<span></span>rmances, art and indeed all expressions<span></span> of <span></span>human </p><p>symbolic culture may <span></span>in<span></span> this light be understood as ‘collusion in </p><p>deception’ (Knight, P<span></span>ower<span></span> &amp; Watts 1995; Rue 1994) — collaboration in </p><p>the maintenance of <span></span>f<span></span>ictions which have social support. Trust in the </p><p>founding f<span></span>ictions <span></span>is not given lightly.

Pr<span></span>etend<span></span>-play is the imaginative use<span></span> of <span></span>one thing <span>as if</span> it<span></span> </p><p>were another. <span></span>One<span></span> child may take, say, a pencil, and move it through the </p><p>air like <span></span>an<span></span> aeroplane.

Faced with <span></span>a<span></span> playmate’s patent fict<span></span>ion, <span></span>the<span></span> child shows </p><p>little inclination to collude. </p><p>Eff<span></span>ective,<span></span> creative speech depends on imaginative mindreading skills and </p><p>hence on collusion in <span></span>a<span></span> much wider domain of symbolic behaviour. The </p><p>concept of <span>co-operative pretend-play</span> is central to our curr<span></span>ent<span></span> under </p><p>standing of how <span></span>child<span></span>ren acquire speech (Bates, Bretherton &amp; Snyder </p><p>1988; Bruner <span></span>1977;<span></span> Trevarthen 1979); it is equally central to ‘speech act’ </p><p>theory (<span></span>Austin 1978;<span></span> Searle 1969). Take a seemingly propositional </p><p>utterance — f<span></span>o<span></span>r example, <span>There are three bison over the hill</span>. As a factual </p><p>statement, this may appear <span></span>unconnected with<span></span> performative invocation or </p><p>communal pretend-play. Yet i<span></span>n<span></span> reality, a constellation of ritual </p><p>ass<span></span>umptions and expectations underpins its f<span></span>orce. Faced with scepticism, </p><p>the speaker might pr<span></span>e<span></span>face the statement with an oath: <span>I sw<span></span>ear by the </span></p><p>Great Spirit that… <span>. This <span></span>could<span></span> involve taking a knife and drawing blood. </span></p><p>If <span></span>listeners need no<span></span> such costly demonstration, such swearing may be </p><p>abbreviated or <span></span>lef<span></span>t implicit. But in that case, the spea<span></span>ker must alr<span></span>eady </p><p>have paid the r<span></span>i<span></span>tual costs of getting to a position where his or her </p><p>utterances have such weight. </p><p>According to <span></span>anthropo<span></span>logist Pierre Bourdieu (1991: 107): ‘The power of </p><p>words is nothing <span></span>other<span></span> than the delegated power of the spokespe<span></span>rson, and </p><p>his speech… is no more t<span></span>han<span></span> a testimony, and one among others, of the </p><p>guarantee of delegation <span></span>which<span></span> is vested in him.’ The words of <span></span>some </p><p>derided ‘nobody’ have no <span></span>weight<span></span>; we may accuse<span></span> such a person of<span></span> </p><p>‘talking t<span></span>hrough<span></span> his hat’ or ‘talking off the top of his head’. Words </p><p>emanating from such a source lack what <span></span>Austin<span></span> (1978) calls ‘illocutionary </p><p>force’ <span></span>—<span></span> that efficacy which attaches to words when they are accepted as </p><p>trusted, author<span></span>ized.<span></span> If a known liar says ‘I promise’, <span></span>i<span></span>t is not just that no-</p><p>one believes; rather, no pr<span></span>o<span></span>mise is in fact made. To promise is to enter </p><p>into a communally sanctioned contract; one i<span></span>nd<span></span>ividua<span></span>l cannot do <span></span>this </p><p>alone. T<span></span>o<span></span> ‘do things with words’ is to <span>play by the rules<span></span> of the <span></span>whole </span></p><p>congregation<span>, as if <span></span>mandated by<span></span> ‘the gods’; only thus<span></span> authorized <span></span>does<span></span> any </span></p><p>utterance work (<span></span>Bourd<span></span>ieu 1991). </p><p>Speech-act theorists (Austin 1978; <span></span>G<span></span>rice 1969; Sea<span></span>rle 1969, 1983)<span></span> have<span></span> </p><p>establishe<span></span>d that all <span></span>effective speech works on this ba<span></span>sis. Utterances have </p><p>force only through <span></span>collusion<span></span> with a wider system of ritual or ceremonial. </p><p>It i<span></span>s this wide<span></span>r system which sustains the communa<span></span>l f<span></span>ictions (gods, spirits,<span></span> </p><p>etc.) <span></span>upon<span></span> whose authority oaths, promises and comparable declarations </p><p>depend. T<span></span>he <span></span>relevant ‘morally’ authoritative intan<span></span>gibles are products of </p><p>communal ritual (Durkheim 1965): they are ingroup </p></div></div></div>

In the final <span></span>anal<span></span>ysis<span></span>, people <span></span>are on </p><p>speaking terms only with those who ‘<span></span>sha<span></span>re the same gods’. The magic of </p><p>words is the collusion of a ritual <span></span>ing<span></span>roup. Withdraw the collusion and </p><p>nothing happens — the <span></span>spea<span></span>ker’s words are empty sound. </p><p>Unlike Machiavellian primates, whose creative fi<span></span>ct<span></span>ions prompt </p><p>countermeasures from those around them, human conversationalis<span></span>ts </p><p>routinely <span>encourage</span> that ver<span></span>y<span></span> resort to imaginative story-telling which in </p><p>primates is socially resisted. Humans reward <span></span>one<span></span> anothe<span></span>r i<span></span>n the<span></span> curr<span></span>ency </p><p>of status, conf<span></span>er<span></span>red by listeners in proportion as utte<span></span>rances appear </p><p>relevant in <span></span>address<span></span>ing some shared concern (Dessalles, this volume). </p><p>Such status-seeking may appear individualistic and competitive (Burling </p><p>1986), <span></span>but<span></span> we should remember that there are limits to this. Speakers, </p><p>whatever their <span></span>di<span></span>fferences, must remain in effect co-religionists — those </p><p>‘in t<span></span>he know<span></span>’ must be trusted to use the discourse for shared purposes, </p><p>concealing it where necessary from outsiders. Where these conditions are </p><p>not met, then t<span></span>he<span></span> relationship of status to relevance may be reverse<span></span>d. </p><p>When conspiring to rob a <span></span>bank<span></span>, for example, the important thing is not<span></span> to </p><p>divulge the plan to the <span></span>autho<span></span>rities. Preparations for war, or for a ritual </p><p>contest against the enemy team, <span></span>equally<span></span> demand dis<span></span>cretion. <span></span>Such cases<span></span> </p><p>remind us that ‘r<span></span>elevanc<span></span>e’ is defined by a problem s<span></span>hared, and <span></span>that social </p><p>boundaries are likely <span></span>to<span></span> be decisive. Far from raisi<span></span>ng one’s ingr<span></span>oup<span></span> status, </p><p>being relevant to the wr<span></span>ong<span></span> people will lower it. </p><p>A status-conferring <span></span>ing<span></span>roup admits members only at a price. Traditionally </p><p>— as in t<span></span>he cas<span></span>e of Aboriginal Australian male secret societies — the </p><p>initiatory <span></span>o<span></span>rdeals tend to be bloody and painful (Knight 1991). </p><p>Willingness to pay the costs displays commitment; in principle, the </p><p>heavier the costs, the <span></span>better<span></span>. Ritual is the one signal which, in being </p><p>visibly costly, carr<span></span>ies its<span></span> own authentication — requiring no external </p><p>corroboration <span></span>becaus<span></span>e in principle it cannot deceive<span></span> (Aunger <span></span>1995; </p><p>Rappaport 1979). Ingr<span></span>oup<span></span> confidence in other signals, such as cheap </p><p>vocal ones, can now <span></span>be base<span></span>d on this ultimate ‘gold standard’. Effective </p><p>speake<span></span>rs are t<span></span>hose<span></span> who,<span></span> having paid the costs, are <span></span>authorized to act ‘in </p><p>God’s name’ (<span></span>Bourdieu<span></span> 1991). Such authority can at any time be with </p><p>drawn. <span></span>Under<span></span> such circumstances<span></span>, <span></span>only an incompetent Mac<span></span>hiavellian </p><p>would be tempted <span></span>to<span></span> lie. </p><p>All this is f<span></span>a<span></span>r removed from primate-style ‘Machiavellian’ politics. </p><p>Chimpanzees<span></span> may play,<span></span> but their playful fictions are not collectively </p></div></div></div>

If everyone is king, then </p><p>no-one is. <span></span>Hunte<span></span>r-gatherer females as well as males<span></span> show strong aversion </p><p>to submission (Knauft <span></span>1994:<span></span> 182). Hunter-gatherer egalitarianism, in this </p><p>Darwinian perspective, becomes established as<span></span> the <span></span>capa<span></span>cities of dom<span></span>inant </p><p>individuals to exploit subordinates become increasingly matched by </p><p>group members’ ‘counterdominance’ <span></span>capac<span></span>ities.

Periodic </p><p>collective withdrawal of sexual access<span></span>, pr<span></span>ompted whe<span></span>never provisions </p><p>run low, is conceptualized by <span></span>Knight<span></span> (1991) in terms of ‘strike’-action. </p><p>One way of <span></span>testing <span></span>this model is to ask what kinds of signalling behaviour </p><p>it would <span></span>p<span></span>redict. Courtship ‘ritual’ in the animal world is central to a </p><p>species<span></span>’ mate r<span></span>ecognition system; the basic pattern is one in which </p><p>females signal to prospective male par<span></span>tne<span></span>rs: <span>I am of the same species<span></span> as </span></p><p>you; of <span></span>the<span></span> opposite sex; and it is my fertile time<span>. On this basis, we would </span></p><p>predict sexually defiant females to r<span></span>everse<span></span> the signals to <span>Wrong </span></p><p>species<span></span>/sex/time<span>. <span></span>This, then, is the predicted signature of ‘sex strike’. </span></p><p>On Darwinian gr<span></span>ounds,<span></span> we would not expect such a mess<span></span>age to be </p><p>transmissible in whispers or in code. F<span></span>o<span></span>r human females<span></span> to i<span></span>ndicate <span>We </span></p><p>are males!, We <span></span>are animals!<span></span> and Anyway, we are all menstr<span></span>uating!<span> <span></span>is on </span></p><p>one level absurd and <span></span>imp<span></span>lausible. The target audience of outgroup males </p><p>will have no <span></span>in<span></span>terest in collusion with such a collective fantasy. To </p><p>overcome listener-resistance, signallers will ther<span></span>e<span></span>fore have to resort to the </p><p>most explicit, <span></span>loud<span></span> and spectacular body-language poss<span></span>ible. <span></span>A costly, </p><p>multimedia, <span></span>deceptive display is<span></span> now being staged by an ingroup to </p><p>impress and exploit outsiders. </p><p>We now have a Darwini<span></span>an <span></span>model of the origins of collec<span></span>tive deception </p><p>through symbolic ritual. Although <span></span>spe<span></span>culative, it is detailed and specific </p><p>enough to be <span></span>testable<span></span> in the light of archaeological and ethnographic </p><p>symbolic data. An <span></span>ext<span></span>remely conservative level of cultural tradition is that </p><p>of magico-r<span></span>elig<span></span>ious symbolism. Southern African archaeologis<span></span>ts widely </p><p>agree that significant <span></span>continui<span></span>ties in San hunter-gatherer material culture </p><p>extend back about 25,<span></span>000<span></span> years — the duration of the<span></span> L<span></span>ater Stone Age </p><p>(Knight <span>et <span></span>a<span></span>l<span>. 1995). Checking the model’s predictions<span></span> against the data <span></span>on </span></span></p><p>ritual, we fi<span></span>nd<span></span> that during the ‘Eland Bull Dance’ of the <span></span>Kalaha<span></span>ri San, </p><p>held to celebrate <span></span>a g<span></span>irl’s first menstruation, women motivate males to </p><p>hunt by <span></span>defiantly<span></span> signalling ‘maleness<span></span>’ and <span></span>‘anima<span></span>lity’.

Archaic humans posses<span></span>sed ‘protolanguage’ </p><p>— a vocal system with <span></span>a<span></span> substantial lexicon but lacking syntax. Vocal </p><p>signs were strung together <span></span>l<span></span>ike beads on a string, in the absenc<span></span>e of <span></span>any </p><p>systema<span></span>tic order<span></span>ing principles. Then, with the eme<span></span>rgence of <span></span>anatomically </p><p>modern humans, <span></span>syntax appeared,<span></span> caused by a genetic mutation which </p><p>abruptly r<span></span>e-wi<span></span>red the brain. </p><p>In thi<span></span>s chapter’s cont<span></span>rasting scenario, something prefiguring ‘syntax’ has </p><p>long been pr<span></span>es<span></span>ent, but not initially as a way of ordering combinatorial </p><p>sequenc<span></span>es of<span></span> conventionalized, abbreviated vocal mini-routines. Pre-</p><p>modern humans in this model <span></span>are<span></span> heavily involved in communal pretend-</p><p>play or ‘mimesis’ — fantasy-sharing representational activity <span></span>suc<span></span>h as </p><p>mime, <span></span>song and<span></span> dance (cf. Donald 1991); this drives<span></span> selection pressures </p><p>for <span></span>subtle vol<span></span>itional control over emotionally expre<span></span>ssive vocaliza<span></span>tions and </p><p>linked gestural r<span></span>eprese<span></span>ntations. At this stage, generativity based on </p><p>discrete/particulate structure is held <span></span>back<span></span>, because signallers must still </p><p>combine conventional call with emotionally expr<span></span>es<span></span>s<span></span>ive, costly display i<span></span>n </p><p>each signalling episode, in t<span></span>his <span></span>respect maintaining<span></span> continuity <span></span>with<span></span> </p><p>primate ‘<span></span>ges<span></span>ture-call’ systems (cf. Burling 1993). </p><p>Coalition-members during this evolutionary period have shared interests, </p><p>allowing them t<span></span>o<span></span> arrive at cost-cutting shorthands i<span></span>n repr<span></span>es<span></span>enting food-</p><p>items, predator<span></span>s and<span></span> other things. But there is as yet no polarized </p><p>binary/digital <span></span>ing<span></span>roup/outgroup dynamic structurin<span></span>g relationships across </p><p>the landscape (cf. <span></span>Knight<span></span> 1991: 301—304). Instead, kinship-based </p><p>coalitions and mutual aid networks cross-cut and overlap, with much dual </p><p>membership, confl<span></span>icting<span></span> loyalties and hence intern<span></span>al flux <span></span>and<span></span> instability. </p><p>In thi<span></span>s context,<span></span> it remains as important to withhold relevant information </p><p>as to divulge i<span></span>t<span></span>. Almost any listener is potentially a rival, even when </p><p>currently an <span></span>ally<span></span>, blocking the emergence of a group-wide, trust-based, </p><p>purely conventional system. <span></span>S<span></span>ignallers continue to rely on their primate-</p><p>derived ‘har<span></span>d-<span></span>to-fake’ signals for cajoling, seducing, threatening and so </p><p>on, such emotionally convincing body-<span></span>language sti<span></span>ll retaining primacy </p><p>over any shared code.

of human language. This enormous achievement of our species is best characterized as a
communication technology — not unlike the social media on the Net today — that was collectively invented by ancient humans for a very particular communicative function: the
instruction of imagination. While all other systems of communication in the biological world target the interlocutors’ senses, language allows speakers to systematically instruct their interlocutors in the process of imagining the intended meaning, instead of directly experiencing it. This revolutionary function changed human life forever, and in this book it operates as a unifying concept around which a new general theory of language gradually emerges. Dor identifes a set of fundamental problems in the linguistic sciences: the nature of words; the complexities of syntax; the interface between semantics and pragmatics; the causal relationship between language and thought; language processing; the dialectics of universality and variability; the intricacies of language and power; knowledge of language and its acquisition; the fragility of linguistic communication; and the origins and evolution of language. Dor then shows how the theory provides fresh answers to these problems, resolves persistent difficulties in existing accounts, enhances the significance of empirical and theoretical achievements in the field, and identifies new
directions for empirical research. The theory thus opens a new path toward the unification
of the linguistic sciences on both sides of the cognitive-social divide.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>... Knight's "ritual/speech coevolution" hypothesis focuses on the interactions of high-cost ritual and low-cost linguistic signals with particular reference to the ocher record in the African MSA. Regular ritual performance -song, dance, cosmetic display -among early modern humans provided the matrix of rulegoverned and prosocial behavior within which a speech community based on trust could emerge <mark>(Knight, 1998)</mark>. The spread of ritual across communities would facilitate cooperation between strangers -the widespread prosocial behavior prerequisite for language.  ...</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>... Turning to human symbolic communication, <mark>Knight (1998)</mark> argues that our ancestors developed divergent, formally contrastive types of communication along these two "high-cost" and "low-cost" trajectories: ritual and speech. On the basis of signal evolution theory, it appears that speech emerged in a cooperative context, while ritual did not.  ...</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Are there constraints on the social conditions that could have given rise to language
and symbolic cognition? Language has emerged in no other species than humans,
suggesting a profound obstacle to its evolution. If language is seen as an aspect of
cognition, limitations can be expected in terms of computational capacity. But if it
is seen it as fundamentally for communication, then the problems will be found in
terms of social relationships. Below a certain threshold of cooperation and trust, no
language or symbolic communication could evolve (Knight &amp; Lewis, 2017a); this
has been termed a “platform of trust” (Wacewicz, 2017)....
In this chapter, I argue that quite specific social conditions were prerequisite for the evolution of language- and symbol-ready hominins. One of the requirements differentiating our ancestors from other African apes was a switch to mainly female philopatry – females living with their relatives, rather than dispersing at sexual maturity – coevolving with an increasing tendency to egalitarianism....How did increasing egalitarianism affect males and potentially “feminize” male behavior for cooperative offspring care? How were male and female relations affected in the evolution of genus Homo and Homo sapiens?</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>... Mothers may have a vested interest in teaching their offspring, but human learning is frequently communal. Apes seldom teach because they are competitive-like poker players and Mafia bosses they are motivated to conceal what they know <mark>(Knight, 1998)</mark>.

The book is the outcome of a symposium1 aiming to integrate recent advances in neuroscience and archaeology, and so further our understanding of the origins of the modern human mind. However, as the editors and several other authors note, it is extremely difficult to specify exactly what it is that makes the human mind unique. So one might question whether sapience should be the sole or central issue, and whether there should have been more consideration of other abilities such as play, performance and cooperation.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>... In language evolution research, many see the above honesty constraint as the single most important constraint on the emergence of language (e.g. Power, 2014), and the origins of large-scale sharing of honest information as the "central puzzle" of language evolution <mark>(Knight, 1998;</mark>Fitch, 2010). A common understanding is that this qualifies as a subtype of the general problem of the evolution of cooperation.  ...</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>... It cannot be implemented in a standard animal communication system, where each individual meaning has to be backed up by costly evidence, because combining such meanings would also exponentially increase the associated costs.

We identify the platform of trust as a fundamental prerequisite for the development of a language-like system of symbolic communication. The platform of trust is a social niche in which cheap but honest communication with non-kin is possible, because messages tend to be trusted as a default. We briefly consider the place of the platform of trust on the road map as laid out in the Mirror System Hypothesis. We then turn to recent research on turn-taking in primates, which has been proposed as a precursor of the cooperative structuring of conversation in humans. We suggest, instead, that human turn-taking, in its full richness that makes it an interesting explanatory target, may only appear in a communicative system that is already founded on a community-wide, cooperative platform of trust.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>... Adopting the popular alternative assumption regarding what language is 'for'-communication, as per functionalist linguistics-suggests other answers to these questions and brings to the fore yet another set of issues. In particular, it becomes critically important to determine how language relates to honest signalling [44][45]<mark>[46]</mark>. Furthermore, given that communication is by definition a social/cultural activity, understanding the interaction between the genetic evolution of language users and the cultural evolution of language becomes key, giving rise, in turn, to questions about the relation between the evolution of the cognitive capacity for language and the ways in which language evolves (cf.  ...</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>... According to this approach, this is a necessity that arises when the group reaches a size at which most individuals cannot spend the majority of their time with one another. Other approaches, along similar or related lines of reasoning, suggest that language emerged as a means of communication that would replace one-on-one grooming or would increase group cohesion through ritual <mark>[46,</mark>89,91]. Another model, the hunting coordination theory [92,93], suggests that language emerged as a means of coordinating complex activities that demanded planning ahead of time and during which the participants could not communicate due to limited physical proximity.  ...</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Language plays a pivotal role in the evolution of human culture, yet the evolution of the capacity for language—uniquely within the hominin lineage—remains little understood. Bringing together insights from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, archaeology and behavioural ecology, we hypothesize that this singular occurrence was triggered by exaptation, or ‘hijacking’, of existing cognitive mechanisms related to sequential processing and motor execution. Observed coupling of the communication system with circuits related to complex action planning and control supports this proposition, but the prehistoric ecological contexts in which this coupling may have occurred and its adaptive value remain elusive. Evolutionary reasoning rules out most existing hypotheses regarding the ecological context of language evolution, which focus on ultimate explanations and ignore proximate mechanisms. Coupling of communication and motor systems, although possible in a short period on evolutionary timescales, required a multi-stepped adaptive process, involving multiple genes and gene networks. We suggest that the behavioural context that exerted the selective pressure to drive these sequential adaptations had to be one in which each of the systems undergoing coupling was independently necessary or highly beneficial, as well as frequent and recurring over evolutionary time. One such context could have been the teaching of tool production or tool use. In the present study, we propose the Cognitive Coupling hypothesis, which brings together these insights and outlines a unifying theory for the evolution of the capacity for language. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Therefore, pretend play might have played an important co-evolutionary role in the evolution of language (e.g., Donald 1991;<mark>Knight 1998</mark>, Ginsburg &amp; Jablonka 2014). To investigate this issue further, in the next section we will turn to proposed functions of pretend play in human ontogeny.  ...</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Pretend play is a universal human behaviour with a wide range of effects on social, cognitive, cultural, and linguistic development. Although it has deep evolutionary roots, humans have constructed a specific developmental niche of extended immaturity which can scaffold the development of complex human skills, such as language and perspective-taking. Pretend play serves as one such scaffold in this developmental niche. It serves as a training ground for the acquisition of complex linguistic skills and skills for linguistically negotiating perspectives, but increased linguistic skills also afford more complex forms of pretend play, creating a feedback loop. As such, they also help children to practice and internalize complex cultural practices and roles. In this paper, it is argued that the cultural practice of pretend play within the human developmental niche represents an important factor that scaffolded the evolution of language.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>... Modern human language is remarkably flexible and serves a multitude of adaptive functions, but these functions did not emerge in an all-or-none fashion. The proposed accounting for the emergence of open-ended symbolic signals opens the door to revisiting previous proposals and scenarios for the functions of more language-like communication including social grooming (Dunbar 1998), gossip and reputations (Power 1998), group bonding and ritual <mark>(Knight 1998</mark>), among others. These earlier proposals have been viewed as problematic as they generally assume and presuppose the availability of symbolic signals (Jackendoff 1999, Számadó andSzathmáry 2006).  ...</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>This paper outlines and defends a specific, sequenced multimodal hypothesis for the adaptive emergence symbolic protolanguage in ancestral hominids arising from the need to teach kin lithic tool traditions of cumulative culture requiring high-fidelity transmission. This paper shows that we can develop an incremental, scalable, and more fundamental evolutionary accounting of the adaptive emergence of symbolic protolanguage, teaching and cumulative culture based on gene-culture coevolutionary theory and the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (ESS), but only if we suppose precursor adaptations in both vocal and gestural modalities in a particular evolutionary sequence. The hypotheses and account proposed here advances solutions to the many classical problems as captured in seven current criteria for theories of language evolution. In addition, I propose an eighth criteria as I show how the proposed account may explain the developmental biases and trajectories of early child language ontology, aspects that are unexplained under prevailing gesture-first theories of language origins. Based on this more fundamental evolutionary accounting, I conclude that explaining the evolution of language, teaching and cumulative culture are inextricably linked and the result of coevolutionary feedback processes involving sequentially dependent adaptations in communication, teaching and cumulative culture and that these unique characters can no longer be approached or understood in scientific isolation.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>... 9 This capacity to communicate a 'world of patent fictions held collectively to be true on some deeper level' may in fact be the fundamental element in the development of human social groups, with such 'publicly available fictional representations' as law, religion, and money all being enabled by the basic principle of storytelling. <mark>10</mark> Storytelling does not, of course, have unique access to stories. But it is unusual in consistently calling attention to the thinness of the boundaries between audience, teller, and tale.  ...</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Stemming from a culture with a long history of oral storytelling, Beowulf is intensely interested in how stories are told and how audiences make meaning from them. 1 Storytelling is a peculiar medium: its performers slip fluidly between narration and embodiment, and lack any of the tools of mimesis, making it look rather more like teaching than acting; I will argue here that its conscious use of make-believe and reliance on the collective imagination mean that it has most in common with children's fantasy play. Functioning primarily as entertainment, storytelling can shape moral and emotional responses, in effect constructing a community through shared experiences and principles. This chapter seeks to use Beowulf to explore how storytelling works, and to use storytelling as a lens through which to understand some of the sophistication of the poem. Doing so requires a number of relatively disparate threads to be brought together. First comes an overview of what is here meant by 'storytelling' and, in particular, how experiencing performative storytelling can be a communal, creative, and playful experience. This sets the ground for a discussion of the poem's well-documented interest in modes of storytelling, focusing in particular on how it presents the figure of Beowulf and what that presentation can tell us about how storytelling works. Bringing these threads together moves into a discussion of my experience of telling Beowulf and his story in Modern English; a written version of one way in which I tell the first third of the poem forms an Appendix, to which close reference is made.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>... Interestingly, that listeners were able to accu- rately gauge strength from simulated roars and screams suggests that they could detect vocal deception and adjust their judgments accordingly. Evolutionary accounts of vocal signalling contend that, in agonistic or competitive contexts, vocalizers should evolve strategies to better manipulate receivers (thus obfuscating indexical information in favour of motivational signal- ling), while receivers should evolve ways to detect and resist such manipulation (thus reliably estimating indexical characteristics in spite of deceptive voice modulation) [103,<mark>107,</mark>108]. In future work, acoustic analyses could be used to investigate whether cues to deception are encoded in nonverbal vocalizations (e.g., whether roars elicited in natural versus simulated contexts vary structurally), and playback experiments could be employed to assess whether lis- teners can differentiate between natural and simulated vocalisations, or detect volitional vocal exaggeration or minimisation of traits such as body size and strength.  ...</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Despite widespread evidence that nonverbal components of human speech (e.g., voice pitch) communicate information about physical attributes of vocalizers and that listeners can judge traits such as strength and body size from speech, few studies have examined the communicative functions of human nonverbal vocalizations (such as roars, screams, grunts and laughs). Critically, no previous study has yet to examine the acoustic correlates of strength in nonverbal vocalisations, including roars, nor identified reliable vocal cues to strength in human speech. In addition to being less acoustically constrained than articulated speech, agonistic nonverbal vocalizations function primarily to express motivation and emotion, such as threat, and may therefore communicate strength and body size more effectively than speech. Here, we investigated acoustic cues to strength and size in roars compared to screams and speech sentences produced in both aggressive and distress contexts. Using playback experiments, we then tested whether listeners can reliably infer a vocalizer’s actual strength and height from roars, screams, and valenced speech equivalents, and which acoustic features predicted listeners’ judgments. While there were no consistent acoustic cues to strength in any vocal stimuli, listeners accurately judged inter-individual differences in strength, and did so most effectively from aggressive voice stimuli (roars and aggressive speech). In addition, listeners more accurately judged strength from roars than from aggressive speech. In contrast, listeners’ judgments of height were most accurate for speech stimuli. These results support the prediction that vocalizers maximize impressions of physical strength in aggressive compared to distress contexts, and that inter-individual variation in strength may only be honestly communicated in vocalizations that function to communicate threat, particularly roars. Thus, in continuity with nonhuman mammals, the acoustic structure of human aggressive roars may have been selected to communicate, and to some extent exaggerate, functional cues to physical formidability.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>The poster briefly defines "the human difference" - which other behavioural scientists seem unable to do - and then explains how it must follow that human societies legitimate their inequities by falsifying the way we see ourselves and the world.

Rue reassesses the value of deception in nature, and in human society, asserting that myths are essential to the health, and even survival, of a culture as a whole. Advancing his theory of the Noble Lie, he maintains that we urgently require a new myth to replace the religious beliefs rejected by the modern mind. Such a Lie, Rue believes, offers our only salvation from the psychological and social chaos now threatened by the spread of scepticism about the meaning of the universe and life. Rue holds our deeply ingrained western bias against deception up to rigorous examination, comparing it to what he calls the natural bias in favour of deception. Evolution rewards the successful deceiver, he maintains, and cites examples from the natural world and from psychological research indicating that strategies of deception and self-deception are essential to our personal well-being.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>This book proposes a theory of human cognitive evolution, drawing from paleontology, linguistics, anthropology, cognitive science, and especially neuropsychology. The properties of humankind's brain, culture, and cognition have coevolved in a tight iterative loop; the main event in human evolution has occurred at the cognitive level, however, mediating change at the anatomical and cultural levels. During the past two million years humans have passed through three major cognitive transitions, each of which has left the human mind with a new way of representing reality and a new form of culture. Modern humans consequently have three systems of memory representation that were not available to our closest primate relatives: mimetic skill, language, and external symbols. These three systems are supported by new types of ''hard'' storage devices, two of which (mimetic and linguistic) are biological, one technological. Full symbolic literacy consists of a complex of skills for interacting with the external memory system. The independence of these three uniquely human ways of representing knowledge is suggested in the way the mind breaks down after brain injury and confirmed by various other lines of evidence. Each of the three systems is based on an inventive capacity, and the products of those capacities - such as languages, symbols, gestures, social rituals, and images - continue to be invented and vetted in the social arena. Cognitive evolution is not yet complete: the externalization of memory has altered the actual memory architecture within which humans think. This is changing the role of biological memory and the way in which the human brain deploys its resources; it is also changing the form of modern culture.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Human social life is constrained and defined by our cognitive and emotional dispositions, which are the legacy of our foraging ancestors. But how difficult is it to reconstruct the social systems and cultural traditions of those ancestors? The text provides an answer, in which archaeologists and biological anthropologists set out and demonstrate their reconstructive methods. Contributors use observations of primates and modern hunter-gatherers to illuminate the fossil and artefactual records. Thematic treatment covers the evolution of group size; group composition and the emotional structure of social bonds; sexual dimorphism and the sexual division of labour; and the origins of human cultural traditions. This book should be a useful introduction to the subject for advanced undergraduates and researchers in archaeology and biological anthropology. It can also be used by workers in psychology, sociology and feminist studies as a resource for understanding human social origins.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>The abstract for this document is available on CSA Illumina.To view the Abstract, click the Abstract button above the document title.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></section></div><p><span><div gutter="xs"><div><div role="dialog" aria-modal="true" tabindex="-1"><div><div><p>Discover the world's research</p><p>Join ResearchGate to find the people and research you need to help your work.</p></div></div></div></div></div></span></p></div></div>
