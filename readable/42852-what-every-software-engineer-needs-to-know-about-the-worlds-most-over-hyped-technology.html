“service mesh” has probably infiltrated your consciousness some time over the
past few years. Thanks to a strange confluence of events, this phrase has been
rolling around the industry like a giant Katamari ball, glomming on
successively bigger pieces of marketing and hype and showing no signs of
stopping any time soon.</p><p>The service mesh was born in the murky, trend-infested waters of the cloud
native ecosystem, which unfortunately means that a huge amount of service mesh
content ranges from “low-calorie fluff” to—to use a technical
term—“basically bullshit”. But there’s some real, concrete, and important
value to the service mesh, if you can cut through all the noise.</p><p>In this guide I’m going to attempt just that: to provide an honest, deep,
engineer-focused guide to the service mesh. I’m going to cover not just the
<em>what</em> but also the <em>why</em> and the <em>why now</em>. Finally, I’m going to attempt to
describe why I think this particular technology has attracted such a crazy
level of hype, which is an interesting story in and of itself.</p><h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2><p>Hi there. I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/wm">William Morgan</a>. I am one of the
creators of <a href="https://linkerd.io/">Linkerd</a>, the very first service mesh project
and the project that gave birth to the term <em>service mesh</em> itself. (Sorry!) I’m
also the CEO of <a href="https://buoyant.io">Buoyant</a>, a startup that builds cool
service mesh stuff like Linkerd and <a href="https://dive.co">Dive</a>.</p><p>As you might imagine, I am very biased and have some strong opinions on this
topic. That said, so I’m going to do my best to leave the editorializing to a
minimum (except one section, “Why do people talk <em>so much</em> about this?“, where
I’ll unveil some opinions) and I’ll do my best to write this guide in a way
that is as objective as possible. When I need concrete examples I’ll primarily
rely on Linkerd, but when there are differences I know about with other mesh
implementations I’ll call them out.</p><p>Ok. On to the good stuff!</p><h2 id="what-is-a-service-mesh">What is a service mesh?</h2><p>For all the hype, the service mesh is architecturally pretty straightforward.
It’s nothing more than a bunch of userspace proxies, stuck “next” to your
services (we’ll talk about what “next” means in a bit), plus a set of
management processes. The proxies are referred to as the service mesh’s <em>data
plane,</em> and the management processes as its <em>control plane</em>. The data plane
intercepts calls between services and “does stuff” with these calls; the
control plane coordinates the behavior of the proxies, and provides an API for
you, the operator, to manipulate and measure the mesh as a whole.</p><p><img src="/images/diag1.svg" alt="drawing"></p><p>What are these proxies? They’re Layer 7-aware TCP proxies, just like haproxy
and NGINX. The choice of proxy varies; Linkerd uses a Rust proxy simply called
<a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy">linkerd-proxy</a> that we built
specifically for the service mesh. Other meshes use different proxies; Envoy is
a common choice. But the choice of proxy is an implementation detail.</p><p>What do these proxies do? They proxy calls to and from the services, of course.
(Strictly speaking, they act as both “proxies” and “reverse proxies”, handling
both incoming and outgoing calls.) And they implement a featureset that focuses
on the calls <em>between</em> services. This focus on traffic between services is what
differentiates service mesh proxies from, say, API gateways or ingress proxies,
which focus on calls from the outside world into the cluster as a whole.</p><p>So that’s the data plane. The control plane is simpler: it’s a set of
components that provide whatever machinery the data plane needs to act in a
coordinated fashion, including service discovery, TLS certificate issuing,
metrics aggregation, and so on. The data plane calls the control plane to
inform its behavior; the control plane in turn provides an API to allow the
user to modify and inspect the behavior of the data plane as a whole.</p><p>Here’s a diagram of Linkerd’s control plane and data plane. You can see that
the control plane has several different components, including a small
Prometheus instance that aggregates metrics data from the proxies, as well as
components such as <code>destination</code> (service discovery), <code>identity</code> (certificate
authority), and <code>public-api</code> (web and CLI endpoints). The data plane, by
contrast, is just a single linkerd-proxy next to an application instance. This
is just the logical diagram; when deployed, you may end up with three replicas
of each control plane component but hundreds or thousands of data plane
proxies.</p><p>(The blue boxes in this diagram represent Kubernetes pod boundaries. You can
see that the linkerd-proxy containers actually run in the same pod as the
application containers. This pattern is known as a <em>sidecar</em> container.)</p><p><img src="images/control-plane.png" alt="diag2" title="Linkerd's architecture" width="100%"></p><p>The architecture of the service mesh has a couple big implications. For one,
since the proxy featureset is designed for service-to-service calls, the
service mesh really only makes sense if your application is built as services.
You <em>could</em> use it with a monolith, but it would be a whole lot of machinery to
run a single proxy, and the featureset wouldn’t be a great fit.</p><p>Another consequence is that the service mesh is going to require <em>lots</em> and
<em>lots</em> of proxies. In fact, Linkerd adds one linkerd-proxy per instance of
every service. (Some other mesh implementations add one proxy per node / host /
VM. It’s a lot either way.) This heavy use of proxies itself has a couple
implications:</p><ol><li>Whatever these data plane proxies are, they’d better be <em>fast</em>. You’re
adding two proxy hops to every call, one on the client side and one on the
server side.</li><li>Also, the proxies need to be <em>small</em> and <em>light</em>. Each one will consume
memory and CPU, and this consumption will scale linearly with your
application.</li><li>You’re going to need a system for deploying and updating lots of proxies.
You don’t want to have to do this by hand.</li></ol><p>But, at least at the 10,000ft level, that’s really all there is to the service
mesh: you deploy a ton of userspace proxies to “do stuff” to internal,
service-to-service traffic, and you use the control plane to change their
behavior and to query the data they generate.</p><p>Now let’s move on to the why.</p><h2 id="why-does-the-service-mesh-make-sense">Why does the service mesh make sense?</h2><p>If you’re encountering the idea of service mesh for the first time, you can be
forgiven if your first reaction is mild horror. The design of the service mesh
means that not only does it add latency to your application, it <em>also</em> consumes
resources and <em>also</em> introduces a whole bunch of machinery. One minute you’re
installing a service mesh, the next you’re suddenly on the hook for operating
hundreds or thousands of proxies. Why would anyone want to do this?</p><p>There are two parts to the answer. The first is that the operational cost of
deploying these proxies can be greatly reduced, thanks to some other changes
that are happening in the ecosystem. Lots more on that later.</p><p>The more important answer is because this design is actually a great way to
introduce additional logic into the system. That’s not only because there are a
ton of features you can add right there, but also because you can add them
without changing the ecosystem. In fact, the entire service mesh model is
predicated on this very insight: that, in a multi-service system, regardless of
what individual services actually <em>do</em>, the traffic <em>between</em> them is an ideal
insertion point for functionality.</p><p>For example, Linkerd, like most meshes, has a Layer 7 feature set focused
primarily on HTTP calls, including HTTP/2 and gRPC. The feature set is
broad, but can be divided into three classes:</p><ol><li><strong>Reliability features</strong>. Request retries, timeouts, canaries (traffic
splitting/shifting), etc.</li><li><strong>Observability features</strong>. Aggregation of success rates, latencies, and request
volumes for each service, or individual routes; drawing of service topology
maps; etc.</li><li><strong>Security features</strong>. Mutual TLS, access control, etc.</li></ol><p>Many of these features operate at the request level (hence the “L7 proxy”). For
example, if service Foo makes an HTTP call to service Bar, the linkerd-proxy on
Foo’s side can load balance that call intelligently across all the instances of
Bar based on the observed latency of each one; it can retry the request if it
fails and if it’s idempotent; it can record the response code and latency; and
so on. Similarly, the linkerd-proxy on Bar’s side can reject the call if it’s
not allowed, or is over the rate limit; it can record latency from its
perspective; and so on.</p><p>The proxies can “do stuff” at the connection level too. For example, Foo’s
linkerd-proxy can initiate a TLS connection and Bar’s linkerd-proxy can
terminate it, and both sides can validate the others’ TLS certificate. This
provides not just encryption between services, but a cryptographically secure
form of service identity—Foo and Bar can “prove” they are who they say they
are.</p><p>Whether they’re at the request or at the connection level, one important thing
to note is that the features of the service mesh are all <em>operational</em> in
nature. There isn’t anything in Linkerd about transforming the semantics of the
request payload, e.g. adding fields to a JSON blob or transforming a protobuf.
This is an important distinction that touch on again when we talk about ESBs
and middleware.</p><p>So that’s the set of features that the service mesh can provide. But why not
just implement them directly in the application? Why bother with the proxies at
all?</p><h2 id="why-is-the-service-mesh-a-good-idea">Why is the service mesh a good idea?</h2><p>While the featureset is interesting, the core value of the service mesh is not
actually in the features. After all, we <em>could</em> implement these features
directly in the application themselves. (In fact, we’ll see later that this was
the genesis of the service mesh.) If I had to put it into a single sentence,
the value of the service mesh comes down to this: <strong>The service mesh gives you
features that are critical for running modern server-side software in a way
that’s uniform across your stack and decoupled from application code.</strong></p><p>Let’s take that one bit at a time.</p><p><strong>Features that are critical for running modern server-side software</strong>. If you
are building a transactional, server side application that is connected to the
public Internet and takes requests from the outside world and responds to them
within some short timeframe—think web apps, API servers, and the bulk of
modern server-side software—and if you are building this system as a
collection of services which talk to each other in a synchronous fashion, and
if you are continually modifying this software to add more functionality, and
if you are tasked with keeping this system running even while you’re modifying
it—then congratulations, you are building modern server-side software. And
all those glorious features listed above actually turn out to be critical for
you. The application must be reliable; it must be secure; and you must be able
to observe what it’s doing. And that’s exactly what the service mesh helps
with.</p><p>(Ok, I snuck an opinion in there: that this one approach is the modern way to
build server-side software. There are people in the world today who are
building monoliths or “reactive microservices” and other things that don’t fit
into the definition above, who might have a different opinion. In turn, my
opinion is that their opinion is “wrong”—but either way the service mesh is
not very useful for them.)</p><p><strong>Uniform across your stack</strong>. The features provided by the service mesh aren’t
just critical, they apply to every service in your application, regardless of
what language the service is written in, what framework is uses, who wrote it,
how it was deployed, or any other detail of development or deployment.</p><p><strong>Decoupled from application code</strong>. Finally, the service mesh doesn’t just
provide features uniformly across your stack, it does so in a way that requires
no application changes. The fundamental ownership of the service mesh
functionality—including the operational ownership of configuration, updates,
operation, maintenance, etc—lies purely at the platform level, independent of
the application. The application can change without the service mesh being
involved, and the service mesh can change without the application being
involved.</p><p>In short: not only does the service mesh provide vital features, it does so in
a way that’s global, uniform, and independent of the application. And so while
yes, the features of the service mesh could be implemented in the service code
(even as a library that was linked in to to every service), this approach would
not provide the decoupling and uniformity that’s at the heart of the service
mesh value prop.</p><p>And all you have to do is add a lot of proxies! I promise that we were going to
talk about the operational cost of adding all these proxies very soon. But
first, we need a pit stop to examine this idea of decoupling from the
perspective of <em>people</em>.</p><h2 id="who-does-the-service-mesh-help">Who does the service mesh help?</h2><p>As inconvenient as it may be, it turns out that in order for technology to
actually have an impact, it must be adopted by human beings. So who adopts the
service mesh? Who benefits from it?</p><p>If you’re building what I’ve described above as modern server software above,
you can roughly think of your team as divided into <em>service owners</em>, who are in
the business of building the business logic, and <em>platform owners</em>, who are
building the internal platform on which these services run. In small
organizations, these may be the same people, but as the organization gets
larger these roles typically get more defined and even further subdivided.
(There’s a lot more to be said here about the changing nature of devops, the
organizational impact of microservices, etc. But for now let’s take these
descriptions as a given.)</p><p>Seen through this lens, the immediate beneficiary of the service mesh is the
platform owners. The goal of the platform team, after all, is to build the
internal platform on which the service owners can run their business logic, and
to do so in a way that keeps the service owners as independent as possible from
the gory details of operationalization. The service mesh not only provides
features that are critical for accomplishing this, it does so in a way that
doesn’t, in turn, incur a dependency on service owners.</p><p>The service owners also benefit, albeit in a more indirect way. The goal of the
service owner is to be as productive in possible in building the logic of the
business, and the fewer operational mechanics they have to worry about, the
easier that is. Rather than being on the hook for implementing e.g. retry
policies or TLS, they can focus purely on business logic concerns and trust
that the platform will take care of the rest. That’s a big plus for them as
well.</p><p>The organizational value of the decoupling between platform and service owners
can’t be overstated. In fact, I think it might be <em>the</em> key reason why the
service mesh is valuable.</p><p>We learned this lesson when one of our earliest Linkerd adopters told us just
why they were adopting a service mesh: because it allowed them to “not have to
talk to people”. This was a platform team at a large company was migrating to
Kubernetes. Because their app handled sensitive information, they wanted to
encrypt all communication on the clusters. There were hundreds of services and
hundreds of developers teams, and they were not looking forward to convincing
each dev team to add TLS to their roadmap. By installing Linkerd, they shifted
<em>ownership</em> of the feature out of the hands of developers, for whom it was an
imposition, and into the hands of the platform team, for whom it was a
top-level priority. Linkerd didn’t solve a technical problem for them so much
as it solved an organizational problem.</p><p>In short, the service mesh is less a solution to a technical problem than it is
a solution to a <em>socio-technical</em> problem.</p><h2 id="does-the-service-mesh-solve-all-my-problems">Does the service mesh solve all my problems?</h2><p>Yes. Er, no!</p><p>If you look at the three classes of features outlined above—reliability,
security, and observability—it should be clear that the service mesh is not a
complete solution for any of these domains. While Linkerd can retry requests
when it knows that they are idempotent, it can’t make decisions about what to
return to the user if a service is entirely down—the application must make
these decisions. While Linkerd can report success rates, etc, it can’t look
inside a service and report internal metrics—the application must have
instrumentation. And while Linkerd can do things like mutual TLS “for free”,
there’s a lot more to security solution than just that.</p><p>The subset of features in those domains that the service mesh provides are the
ones that are <em>platform features</em>. By this I mean features that are:</p><ol><li><strong>Independent of business logic.</strong> The way that traffic latency histograms
are computed for calls between Foo and Bar is totally independent of <em>why</em> Foo
is calling the Bar in the first place.</li><li><strong>Difficult to implement correctly.</strong> Linkerd’s retries are
parameterized with sophisticated things like retry budgets because the naive
approach to retries is a sure path to “retry storms” and other distributed
system failure modes.</li><li><strong>Most effective when implemented uniformly.</strong> The mechanics of
mutual TLS only really make sense when everyone is doing them.</li></ol><p>Because these features are implemented at the proxy layer, rather than at the
application layer, the service mesh provides them at the <em>platform</em>, not
application, level. It doesn’t matter what language the services are written
in, or what framework they use, or who wrote them, or how they got there. The
proxies function independent of all that, and the ownership of this
functionality—including the operational ownership of configuration, updates,
operation, maintenance, etc—lies purely at the platform level.</p><p><strong>Example features of the service mesh</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Observability</strong></td><td><strong>Reliability</strong></td><td><strong>Security</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Service Mesh</strong></td><td>Service success rates</td><td>Request retries</td><td>Mutual TLS between all services</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Platform (non-service mesh)</strong></td><td>Log aggregation</td><td>Multiple replicas of dataset</td><td>Encryption of data at rest</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Application</strong></td><td>Instrumentation of internal feature usage</td><td>Handling of failure when an entire component is down</td><td>Ensuring users only have access to their own data</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To summarize: the service mesh is not a complete solution to reliability, or to
observability, or to security. The broader ownership of those domains
necessarily involves service owners, ops and SRE teams, and other parts of the
organization. The service mesh can only provide a platform-layer “slice” of
each domain.</p><h2 id="why-does-the-service-mesh-make-sense-now">Why does the service mesh make sense <em>now</em>?</h2><p>At this point you may be saying to yourself: ok, if this service mesh thing is
so great, why weren’t we rolling millions of proxies in our stack ten years
ago?</p><p>There’s a shallow answer to this, which is that ten years ago everyone was
building monoliths, and so no one needed a service mesh. Which is true, but I
think misses the point. Even ten years ago, the concept of “microservices” as a
feasible way of building high-scale systems was widely discussed, and was
publicly being put into practice at companies like Twitter, Facebook, Google,
and Netflix. The general sentiment, at least in the parts of the industry I was
exposed to, was that microservices were the “right way” to build high-scale
systems, even if gosh they were really painful to do.</p><p>Of course, while there were companies operating microservices ten years ago,
they were by and large not installing proxies everywhere to form a service
mesh. If you looked closely, though, they were doing something related: many of
these organizations mandated the use of a specific internal library for network
communication (sometimes called a “fat client” library). Netflix had Hysterix,
Google had the Stubby libraries, and Twitter had Finagle. Finagle, for example,
was mandatory for every new service at Twitter, handled both client and server
sides of the connection, and implemented retries, and request routing, and load
balancing, and instrumentation. It provided a consistent layer of reliability
and observability across the entire Twitter stack, independent of what the
service itself actually did. Sure, it only worked for JVM languages, and it had
a programming model that you had to build your whole app around, but the
operational features it provided were almost exactly those of the service
mesh.</p><p>So ten years ago, not only did we have microservices, we had proto-service-mesh
libraries that solved many of the same problems that the service mesh solves
today. But we didn’t have the service mesh. Something else needed to change
first.</p><p>And that’s where the deeper answer lies, buried in another difference
that’s happened over the past ten years: there’s been a <em>dramatic</em> reduction of
the cost of deploying microservices. The companies I’ve listed above who were
publicly using microservices a decade ago—Twitter, Netflix, Facebook,
Google—were companies of immense scale and immense resources. They had
not just the need but the <em>talent</em> to build, deploy, and operation significant
microservice applications. The sheer amount of engineering time and energy that
went into Twitter’s migration from monolith to microservices boggles the
imagination, and this sort of infrastructural maneuver was essentially
impossible for smaller companies.</p><p>Contrast that to today, where you might encounter startups with a 5:1 or even
<a href="https://twitter.com/JackKleeman/status/1190407465659183104">10:1 ratio of microservices to
developers</a>—and
what’s more, they are equipped to handle it. If running 50 microservices is a
plausible approach for a 5-person startup, then clearly something has reduced
the cost of adopting microservices.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/JackKleeman/status/1190407465659183104"><img src="images/monzo-topology.png" title="Monzo's application as of 2019 comprises 1500 microservices" width="100%"></a></p><p>The dramatic reduction in the cost of operating microservices is a result of
one thing: <em>the rise in the adoption of containers and container
orchestrators</em>. And this is where the deeper answer to the question of what
change has enabled the service mesh lies. What’s made the service mesh
operationally viable is the same thing that’s making microservices
operationally viable: Kubernetes and Docker.</p><p>Why? Well, Docker solves one big thing: the packaging problem. By allowing you
to package your app and its (non-network) runtime dependencies into a
container, your app is now a fungible unit that can be thrown around and run
anywhere. By the same token, Docker makes it exponentially easier to run a
<em>polyglot</em> stack: because the container is an atomic unit of execution, for
deploy and operational purposes it doesn’t really matter what’s inside the
container, and whether it’s a JVM app or a Node app or Go or Python or Ruby.
You just run it.</p><p>Kubernetes solves the next step: now that I have a bunch of “executable
things”, and I also have a bunch of “things that can execute these executable
things” (aka machines), I need a mapping between them. In a broad sense, you
give Kubernetes a bunch of containers and a bunch of machines, and it figures
out this mapping. (Which of course is a dynamic and ever-shifting thing, as new
containers roll through the system, machines come in and out of operation, and
so on. But Kubernetes figures it out.)</p><p>Once you have Kubernetes going, the deploy-time cost of running one service is
not that much different from running ten services, and in fact not that
different from 100 services. Combine that with the container as packaging
mechanism that encourages polyglot implementations, and the result is a ton of
new applications that are implemented as microservices written in a variety of
languages—exactly the environment the service mesh is most suited for.</p><p>And so finally we come to why the service mesh is feasible <em>now</em>: the very same
uniformity that Kubernetes provides for services is directly applicable to the
operational challenges of the service mesh. You package the proxies into
containers, you tell Kubernetes to stick ‘em everywhere, and voila! You got
yourself a service mesh, with all the deploy-time mechanics handled for you by
Kubernetes.</p><p>To summarize: the reason why the service mesh makes sense now, as opposed to 10
years ago, is that the rise of Kubernetes and Docker have not only dramatically
increased the <em>need</em> to run a service mesh, by making it easy to build your
application as a polyglot microservices architecture, they’ve dramatically
reduced the <em>cost</em> of running a service mesh, by providing mechanisms for
deploying and maintaining fleets of sidecar proxies.</p><h2 id="why-do-people-talk-so-much-about-the-service-mesh">Why do people talk SO MUCH about the service mesh?</h2><p><strong>Content warning</strong>: In this section, I resort to speculation, conjecture,
inside baseball, and opinion.</p><p>One need only search for “service mesh” to encounter a Kafka-esque fever dream
of a landscape, full of confusing projects, low-calorie recycled content, and
general echo chamber distortion. All shiny new tech has a certain level of
this, but the service mesh seems to have a particularly bad case. Why is that?</p><p>Well, partly it’s my fault. I’ve done my best to talk up Linkerd and the
service mesh at every opportunity, over countless blog posts and podcasts and
articles like this one. But I’m not <em>that</em> powerful. To really answer this
question, I have to talk about the service mesh landscape. And it’s impossible
to talk about the landscape without talking about one project in particular:
<em>Istio</em>, an open source service mesh that’s billed as a collaboration between
Google, IBM, and Lyft.</p><p>What’s remarkable about Istio is two things. First, the sheer amount of
marketing effort that Google, in particular, is placing behind it. In my
estimation, the majority of people who know about the service mesh <em>today</em> were
introduced to it through Istio. The second remarkable thing is just how poorly
Istio has been received. Obviously I have a horse in this race, but trying to
be as objective as I can, it seems to me that Istio has
<a href="https://twitter.com/quinnypig/status/1163959453810511872">developed</a> a
<a href="https://twitter.com/ibuildthecloud/status/1166400954079428608">pretty</a><a href="https://twitter.com/adamb0mb/status/1177317802509627393">public</a><a href="https://twitter.com/dave_strebel/status/1174116297468252160">backlash</a> in a
way that’s uncommon (though not unheard of) for an open source project.</p><p>Leaving aside my personal theories as to why that’s happening, I believe it’s
Google’s involvement here that is really the reason that the service mesh space
is <em>so</em> hype-y. Specifically, the combination of a) Istio being promoted so
heavily by Google; b) its corresponding lackluster reception; and c) the recent
meteoric rise of Kubernetes still fresh on everyone’s minds have all combined
to form a kind of heady, oxygen-free environment where capacity for rational
thought is extinguished and only a weird kind of cloud-native <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania">tulip
mania</a> remains.</p><p>From the Linkerd perspective, of course, this is… I guess I would describe it
as a mixed blessing. I mean, it’s great that the service mesh is a “thing”
now—this was not the case in 2016 when Linkerd first got off the ground, and
it was really hard to get anyone to pay attention. We don’t have that problem
any more! But it sucks that the service mesh landscape is so confusing and it’s
so hard to understand even <em>which</em> projects are service meshes, never mind
which one fits your use case the best. That does everyone a disservice. (And
there are certainly situations where Istio or another project would be the
right choice over Linkerd—it’s far from a one-size-fits-all solution.)</p><p>On the Linkerd side, our strategy has been to ignore the noise, continue
focusing on solving real problems for our community, and basically wait for the
whole thing to blow over. The level of hype will eventually subside and we can
all get on with our lives.</p><p>In the meantime, though, we’re all going to have to suffer through this together.</p><h2 id="so-should-i-a-humble-software-engineer-care-about-the-service-mesh">So… should I, a humble software engineer, care about the service mesh?</h2><p>If you’re a software engineer, here’s my basic rubric for whether you should
care about the service mesh.</p><p><strong>If you are in a pure business-logic-implementin’ developer role:</strong> No, you
don’t really need to care about the service mesh. I mean, you’re certainly
welcome to care, but ideally the service mesh won’t directly affect anything in
your life. Keep building that sweet, sweet business logic that gets everyone
around you paid.</p><p><strong>If you are in a platform role in an org that is using Kubernetes:</strong> Yes, you
100% should care. Unless you are adopting K8s purely to run a monolith or to do
batch processing (in which case, I would seriously ask the question of why
K8s), you’re going to end up in a situation where you have lots of
microservices, all written by other people, all talking to each other, all tied
together into one unholy bundle of runtime dependencies, and you’re going to
need a way to deal with that. Since you’re on Kubernetes, you will have several
service mesh options, and you should have an informed opinion about which ones
or even whether you want any of them at all. (Start with Linkerd.)</p><p><strong>If you are in a platform role in an org that is NOT using Kubernetes, but IS
“doing microservices”:</strong> Yes, you should care, but it’s going to be
complicated. Sure, you could get the <em>value</em> of the service mesh by deploying
lots of proxies everywhere, but the nice part of Kubernetes is the deployment
model, and your ROI equation is going to look very different if you have to
manage these proxies yourself.</p><p><strong>If you are in a platform role in an org that is “doing monoliths”:</strong> No, you
probably don’t need to care. If you are operating a monolith, or even a
“collection of monoliths” that have well-defined and infrequently-changing
communication patterns, then the service mesh will not add very much and you
can probably just ignore it and hope it goes away.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The service mesh probably doesn’t actually hold the title of “the World’s Most
Over-Hyped Technology”–that dubious distinction probably goes to Bitcoin or
AI. Maybe it’s merely in the top 5. But if you can cut through the layers of
noise, there’s some real value to be had for anyone who’s building applications
on Kubernetes.</p><p>Finally, I’d love for you to try Linkerd—it should <a href="https://linkerd.io/2/getting-started/">take about 60 seconds to
install</a> on a Kubernetes cluster, even
just a Minikube on your laptop—and you can see for yourself exactly what I’m
talking about.</p><h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2><h3 id="if-i-just-ignore-this-whole-service-mesh-thing-will-it-just-go-away">If I just ignore this whole service mesh thing will it just go away?</h3><p>Sadly, the service mesh is here to stay.</p><h3 id="but-i-don-t-want-to-use-a-service-mesh">But I don’t WANT to use a service mesh.</h3><p>Then don’t. But see my guide above as to whether you need to understand it.</p><h3 id="isn-t-this-just-esb-middleware-all-over-again">Isn’t this just ESB / middleware all over again?</h3><p>The service mesh focuses on operational logic, not business logic. <a href="https://twitter.com/samnewman/status/1131116454118612997">That was
the downfall of the enterprise service
bus</a>. Keeping that
separation is critical for the service mesh avoiding the same fate.</p><h3 id="how-is-this-different-from-api-gateways">How is this different from API gateways?</h3><p>There are a million articles about this. Just google it.</p><h3 id="is-envoy-a-service-mesh">Is Envoy a service mesh?</h3><p>No, it’s not a service mesh. Envoy is a proxy. It can be used to make a service
mesh (and many other things; it’s a general-purpose proxy). But it’s not a
service mesh by itself.</p><h3 id="is-network-service-mesh-a-service-mesh">Is Network Service Mesh a service mesh?</h3><p>No. Despite the name, it’s not a service mesh. (Marketing is fun, right?)</p><h3 id="will-the-service-mesh-help-my-reactive-asynchronous-message-queue-based-system">Will the service mesh help my reactive, asynchronous message queue-based system?</h3><p>No, the service mesh won’t help you.</p><h3 id="which-service-mesh-should-i-use">Which service mesh should I use?</h3><p><a href="https://linkerd.io">Linkerd</a>. Duh.</p><h3 id="i-think-this-article-sucks-i-think-you-suck">I think this article sucks / I think you suck.</h3><p>Please share this link with all your friends so that they can see just how much

fantastic treatise on logs, <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">The Log: What every software engineer should know
about real-time data’s unifying
abstraction</a>.
I met Jay when I interviewed at LinkedIn almost a decade ago and he’s been an
inspiration ever since.</p><p>While I like to call myself a Linkerd maintainer, the reality is that I am
mostly “maintainer of Linkerd’s README.md”. Linkerd today is
the work of
<a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/graphs/contributors">many</a><a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy/graphs/contributors">many</a><a href="https://github.com/linkerd/website/graphs/contributors">many</a><a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/graphs/contributors">many</a> people,
and would not be possible
without the amazing community of contributors and adopters.</p><p>Finally, a special shoutout to the creator of Linkerd, <a href="https://twitter.com/olix0r">Oliver
Gould</a> (<em>primus inter pares</em>), who took the plunge
with me on this whole service mesh thing many years ago.</p></div></div></div></div>
