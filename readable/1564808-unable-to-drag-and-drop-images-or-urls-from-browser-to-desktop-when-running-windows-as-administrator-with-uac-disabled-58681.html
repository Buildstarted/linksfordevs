<p>Update: I tried downgrading to 67, and now it still doesn't work for some reason. Not even on a new profile.</p>

[Why is this notable]: The issue is coming up a couple of times in support channels after the 68 release and we already have a sumo article explaining workarounds, so it might be helpful adding this as a known issue to the release notes.<br>
[Affects Firefox for Android]: no<br>
[Suggested wording]: Windows administrator users with UAC turned off may no longer be able to drag content out of Firefox. To learn more and how to fix this see &lt;sumo article&gt;<br>

<p>That command worked but sometimes I've found with it sometimes links created won't either auto open with Firefox or if you drag it onto an already open Firefox nothing works.</p>

<p>You can't drag and drop from from lower to higher privilege, so it sounds as though the link/shortcut is running in a less privileged context than Firefox (with -no-deelevate, Firefox presumably is running as a high integrity process).</p>
<p>Can you re-enable UAC instead? It's not like the bad old Vista days, at least on Windows 10.</p>
