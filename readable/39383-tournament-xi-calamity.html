Waves of wild energies are raining from the heavens, threatening to eradicate all stable arcane energies and decades of magic study.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><br><p><span>The Circle of Five, generally cloistered from the mundane undertakings of all others, has taken action in an attempt to prevent the annihilation of magic and possibly the whole of Elgea.&#xA0; The Circle asks now that the armies of Elgea and the Broken lands amass at pylons they have specially constructed. These structures will draw energy from all surrounding it, shielding vital arcane junctions from being tainted with chaotic magic.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><br><p><span>Aside from the reward of saving all magic as it is known, the Circle has incentivised participation from alliances with bounties of magical reagents.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>This is an alliance-based, king-of-the-hill tournament that will run from the 26th of October to the 23rd of November.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>We wish you all the best of luck!</span></p><p><span>GM Cerberus</span></p><div><span id="docs-internal-guid-c9e354c5-7fff-da58-a3b2-dac15ff4bc93"><span><font>TOURNAMENT SQUARES - PYLONS OF POWER</font></span></span></div><div><span><span><img src="uploads/1191/PylonTower.png" width="250"><br></span></span></div><div><div id="docs-internal-guid-cfe5050f-7fff-cde6-002c-de82583a9f4a"><p><span>The Tournament runs throughout the end of October to the end of November.&#xA0;
