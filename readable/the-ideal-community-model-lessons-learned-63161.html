            There are many ways to push your career to a point it takes a great turn, but I found out in 2017 that community participation is a must. Community involvement can be anything from Open Source Contributions, Writing articles, answering questions on social media/StackOverflow to speaking at conferences. Participation in your community will expand your network.

By attending small meetups or having conversations in slack channels will lead you to meet new people in your industry. Sharing will increase your visibility in the ecosystem by Founders, people of related skill sets, recruiters, and more.

There isnâ€™t just one way to share your expertise with your community. Open Source Contributions isn't just code, you can write articles/documentation about the product you would like to contribute to about your experiences or speak at conferences. Collaboration helps you to be seen as a leader in your community. You can collaborate with others in your network by mentoring, organizing an event, or working together on a personal project/ideas

I learned most of the things I know today about the community the hard way because I never saw it as anything important, and all I cared about was just write the code and today I am a Senior Developer Advocate at Fleek, and also the lead organizer of some major communities in Africa which included, unStack, Developers Circles Lagos from Facebook, Open Source Community Africa, NaijaHacks, and AfricaHacks.

Key Takeaways:

1) Attendees will learn how to build a community on their own
2) Attendees will learn how open-source works in a community
3) Attendees will learn how to contribute to ideas to a community
