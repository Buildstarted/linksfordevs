Only later would travel between states become possible.</p><p>Asked whether the international bans would stay for this calendar year or beyond, Senator Birmingham said: "It's very difficult to predict and nobody should be getting ahead of themselves at the present."</p><div><div>Loading<div><div><div><p><img alt="Coronavirus: Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly COVID-19 update" itemprop="thumbnailUrl"></p><div><div><p>Up Next</p><h3>Coronavirus: Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly COVID-19 update</h3></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>The minister said he had held "heartbreaking" conversations with people in the tourism business but believed the border controls would remain necessary while COVID-19 was devastating some countries.</p><p>"The failure of many nations to contain the virus will have profound health and economic implications for those countries," he said. "What the consequences are, in terms of stability of government and civil unrest, is impossible to predict at present.</p></div><div><p>"We've put the interest of Australians first, protecting Australians, but of course we will do all that we can beyond that to help those within our region, especially our Pacific Island family, to get through it."</p><p>Ms Osmond said the recovery in the tourism industry would be built on the back of big companies, such as the airlines, and major employers would need more federal support over time.</p><p>Travel destinations hit by bushfires over summer could benefit from the focus on domestic travel over time.</p><p>"What's likely to happen in terms of the industry is that domestic travel will probably be the top of everybody's agenda for the next two years," she said. "If it's not domestic, it might be a little bit to New Zealand.</p></div><div><p>"I don't think that even when it's possible for people to travel internationally that it's going to happen instantly across the whole marketplace.</p><p>"Young people, for example, are the last to stop travelling and the first to start travelling again, so within the market there will be some groups who will choose to go overseas."</p><p>Australian Tourism Export Council managing director Peter Shelley said employers who arranged travel for overseas visitors had been hard hit but accepted it would be "quite a while" before they recovered.</p><p>"We'd be optimistic about something happening in the fourth quarter of this year but, really, it's probably toward the end of the year or the start of next year," he said.</p></div><div><p>Mr Shelley said his members would have to "eke out" a living during the "hibernation" period but were grateful for the JobKeeper wage subsidy of $1500 a fortnight.</p><div><h3>Sign up to our Coronavirus Update newsletter</h3><p>Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day's crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.
