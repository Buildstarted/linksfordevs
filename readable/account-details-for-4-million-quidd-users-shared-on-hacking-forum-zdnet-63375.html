                    <p><a href="https://quidd.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Quidd</a>, an online marketplace for trading stickers, cards, toys, and other collectibles, appears to have suffered a data breach in 2019, and the details of around four million users are now being shared for free on underground hacking forums.</p><p>The data, of which <em>ZDNet </em>has obtained samples from three different sources, contains Quidd usernames, email addresses, and hashed account passwords.</p><h3>A hacker known as ProTag believed to be behind the breach</h3><p>In the cybercrime landscape, there are different groups and entities, each with different roles. There are hackers, the ones who carry out the actual security breaches, and there are data traders, individuals who engage in selling and re-selling the hacked data.</p><p>Two different sources have told <em>ZDNet </em>that a hacker known as ProTag was the one who took credit for the breach and first put the Quidd data for sale.</p><p>In addition, <em>ZDNet </em>has also learned from a data trader that the Quidd information has been trading privately among high-level groups for months, with ads for the Quidd info being posted on hacking forums and Pastebin since at least October and December 2019, respectively.</p><figure><span><img src="https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/04/14/5abd6535-dfc3-42ad-afd8-e28b41692eed/quidd-ads.png" alt="quidd-ads.png"></span><figcaption><span></span><span>

<p>But while the data has traded privately in exclusive rings for months, the Quidd user info has now leaked into the public domain.</p><p>This happened last month after a data trader posted a copy of the Quidd data on a publicly accessible hacker forum.</p>


    <p>Ever since then, the data has been shared and reshared among other members of the hacking community, constantly re-uploaded on multiple forums.</p><figure><span><img src="https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/04/14/0c6b95fa-e8ab-4afb-8fab-6495ad66ef03/quidd.png" alt="quidd.png" data-original="https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/04/14/0c6b95fa-e8ab-4afb-8fab-6495ad66ef03/quidd.png"></span><figcaption><span></span><span>

One individual is currently selling access to more than 135,000 cracked Quidd passwords, while Risk-Based Security says it's tracking another individual claiming to provide access to more than one million cracked Quidd accounts.</p><p>Quidd users are advised to change account passwords as soon as possible.</p><figure><span><img src="https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/04/14/b5ce1a32-b6a7-46d5-992a-3622ab7db3a8/quidd-hashed.png" alt="quidd-hashed.png" data-original="https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/04/14/b5ce1a32-b6a7-46d5-992a-3622ab7db3a8/quidd-hashed.png"></span><figcaption><span></span><span>
