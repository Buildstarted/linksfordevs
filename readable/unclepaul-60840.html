<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div id="j-column-0"><li data-id="416971509" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Parenting trick: invent a gesture that means "I love you." 2 yos like it as a game. 8 yos like it because they can use it in public.</p></div></li><li data-id="425581663" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Something I explained to my 11 yo: The biggest division in work may be between jobs that involve making new stuff (science, engineering) and those that don't (administration, sales), and you'll be a lot happier if you end up on the side you're suited for.</p></div></li><li data-id="423693815" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Don't worry about kids acquiring bad programming habits when they're first learning. The only habit that matters is the habit of programming. Tidiness can come later. Enthusiasm can't.</p></div></li><li data-id="421650375" data-source="twitter"><div><div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamokane" target="_blank">@adamokane</a> I tell my kids that it's a custom that swearwords are reserved for adults. But if they doubt the force of custom, they should imagine showing up for school one day naked.</p></div></div></li><li data-id="416372251" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>"Back in high school I told my dad, 'I'm going to have a computer someday.' And he said that it cost as much as a house — the downpayment on a house. And I said, 'Well, I'll live in an apartment.'"</p><p>— Steve Wozniak</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416978525" data-source="twitter"><div><p>We discovered a very effective new way to make our boys drink more water. Burping contests. To his great delight, 7 yo is the family champion.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978521" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>If you ask parents what they want for their kids, many will say "I just want them to be happy." But there are drugs that achieve this, and taking them results in disaster. So that is probably not what we should want.</p><p>(Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/moigottweets" target="_blank">@moigottweets</a> for pointing this out to me.)</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416978860" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>Me: What do you think are your brother's biggest strengths and weaknesses?</p><p>7 yo: His biggest strength is playing video games. His biggest weakness is me.</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416978515" data-source="twitter"><div><p>One of the big differences between my children and myself as a child is that my kids never want to leave the house. When I was a kid, you had to go out to watch movies or eat pizza or (I'm that old) play video games. Now they come to you.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978512" data-source="twitter"></li><li data-id="416978458" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Explained to 7 yo that the phrase for what he is right now is "Star Wars scholar." I explained that lots of people are this way about other things. E.g. that there are lots of Shakespeare scholars. He found it encouraging that the phenomenon had a name.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977901" data-source="twitter"><div><p>My 7 yo can be comically demanding in the bedtime story department. Today I was instructed to make up a story about a dispute between someone's internal organs. And the liver had to be the hero.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977821" data-source="twitter"><div><p>If there is a better background noise to have in your house than a 7 year old laughing, I can't imagine what it is.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977818" data-source="twitter"><div><div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSimler" target="_blank">@KevinSimler</a> My kids are now old enough that I learn a lot from them. They're making their own models of the world, and there are a lot of interesting things in the diffs between theirs and mine.</p></div></div></li><li data-id="416977816" data-source="twitter"><div><p>I miss holding a crying baby. That's something that at one time I not only never imagined I'd think, but I couldn't imagine anyone thinking. It would have seemed almost ill-formed.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977814" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>Something I taught my 10 yo son and his friend today:</p><p>The way most people who are really good at something got so good at it was by (a) caring a lot about it and (b) practicing a lot.</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416977809" data-source="twitter"></li><li data-id="416977806" data-source="twitter"><div><p>I talk to my kids as if they were naive colleagues. I think they learn a lot this way, and if not, it at least seems fairly harmless.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977802" data-source="twitter"><div><p>One technique I use when teaching math to little kids is to get them rapidly to the point where they can answer what seem like impossibly hard questions. E.g. half of 3, half of 5, half of 7, half of 9 (by which point they see the pattern), half of 101, half of 1001.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977798" data-source="twitter"><div><p>One thing I didn't realize before I had kids is how many photos of eager, smiling kids had a parent out of the frame doing something ridiculous to make them laugh.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977795" data-source="twitter"><div><p>I was trying to explain to my 7 yo how powerful it is to be able to read, because you can now learn anything from books instead of waiting for teachers to teach you. When I described a shelf of books as an army of robot teachers, he started to get it.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976421" data-source="twitter"><div><p>When I teach my kids about discoveries, I focus on trying to recreate what people thought before the discovery – in particular, how obvious the earlier, mistaken model of the world seemed. How obvious it seemed that the sun orbited the earth, or that a creator made the species.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976400" data-source="twitter"><div><p>My kids are always coming up with startup ideas. I decided the 10 yo is now old enough to hear the truth: if you want to start a startup, the thing to be doing at 10 is learning the things that will enable you to have good startup ideas at 20. How to program especially.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976394" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Explained liberal and conservative to my 10 yo and 7 yo on the way to school. I ended up describing them as forms of bias that each produced distinctive patterns of error when they hit the truth.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976390" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>Looking at my 7 yo, I asked myself if there was anything that had been consistent about my life from when I was 7 til now.</p><p>Instantly the answer popped into my head: being told "How dare you say that!" by the prim and conventional-minded.</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416976384" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Taught my kids a way to trick bad people. Most bad people assume everyone else has the same motives, so they'll believe you want to do x if they'd want to. E.g. a selfish person will believe you'd want to do something selfish.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978856" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>"Can I walk around so I can get ideas in my head to think about when I'm lying down?"</p><p>– 6 yo at bedtime</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416976377" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>Asked my 10 yo son what parents say all the time. </p><p>"Be careful." </p><p>"Don't nag me." </p><p>"Don't be mean to your little brother." </p><p>All admonitions, and all don'ts, which is a little unfortunate. Probably unrealistic to hope otherwise though.</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416976371" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Kids think their parents are experts, but in many respects they're complete noobs. If you're the oldest child, you're probably the first n-year old your parents have ever had to deal with.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976004" data-source="twitter"><div><p>To lecture someone on morality is implicitly to assume moral superiority over them. Adults do this to children, but not (unless they are clergy) to other adults.</p></div></li><li data-id="416975932" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Now that I'm the annoying parent always taking pictures rather than the child squirming at being photographed, I understand the source of the asymmetry.  They have roughly the same parent their whole childhood, but at 4 we lose the 3 year old and have only pictures left.</p></div></li><li data-id="416972381" data-source="twitter"><div><p>One of the most useful types of insight (maybe the most useful type) is when you notice two apparently different things are the same. I've been training my kids to see these. Not intentionally, just by being delighted when they do.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978855" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>9 yo: What's the point of life?</p><p>Me: I think there are two: to do great things and to be good to people.</p><p>9 yo: Can you tell me someone who did both?</p><p>Me: Mommy. She started Y Combinator, and you know how nice she is.</p><p>9 yo (surprised): Wow, I'm lucky to have her as a mother…</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416972326" data-source="twitter"><div><p>My 6 yo was so excited when he grasped how natural selection works that he makes me explain it to all his friends, like some kind of parlor trick.</p></div></li></div><div id="j-column-1"><li data-id="425897311" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Something I explained to my 11 yo: When your brain tricks you, it's often because it's following a rule that made sense for most of our evolution. (The examples we were talking about were target fixation and the Monte Carlo fallacy.)</p></div></li><li data-id="425351664" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Writing Basic programs (I'm teaching my son Basic) reminds me that there was once a time when I used to be impressed when my programs were long. Look at all the work I've done, I used to think.</p></div></li><li data-id="423492389" data-source="twitter"><div><p>When teaching kids to program, it's good if you're doing something too, instead of standing over them, so they can experiment (which is an important part of programming). But you can't be doing anything uninterruptible. Sorting Lego is perfect.</p></div></li><li data-id="420766958" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Something I told my 11 yo recently: The apparently random collection of things you learn when you're young makes you into a sort of key. Then you have to find the lock it matches. But that's not as hard as it sounds, because the matching lock is usually nearby.</p></div></li><li data-id="416372259" data-source="twitter"><div><p>One surprising thing I've learned from being a parent is that kids often know the words for things they're not supposed to know about, without really knowing what they mean. The solution is to do nothing. The last thing you want to do is ask "Do you know what that means?"</p></div></li><li data-id="416978524" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Most nights our sons react to the announcement that it's bedtime as if bedtime were some new thing we'd just invented that day in order to oppress them.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978520" data-source="twitter"><div><p>10 yo asked when I'd let him and his 7 yo brother walk to school by themselves. I told him the task was not to get himself to school safely, but to get his brother to school safely. I could practically hear his brain struggle to assimilate this paradigm shift.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978518" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Something I taught my 7 yo yesterday: When someone loves someone else, it doesn't just make the loved person happy. It also makes you happy to love someone.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978514" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Told 7 yo I wrote an essay about having kids. He asked if there was anything about him in it. I showed him the paragraph where I said that you don't just love your kids, but they become your friends too. He had a big smile reading that.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978511" data-source="twitter"></li><li data-id="416978387" data-source="twitter"></li><li data-id="416977889" data-source="twitter"><div><div><p>As I explained to my son, one of the most important techniques for doing well on standardized tests is simply to go back and check your answers. Because most standardized tests are too easy, the difference between a good score and a great one is avoiding random slip-ups.</p></div></div></li><li data-id="416977820" data-source="twitter"><div><p>7 yo likes to play while I read bedtime stories. Since there's no chair in the boys' room and his bed is vacant, I sit on that while I read. Last night he wanted to tell a story. I was so tired I fell asleep. So Jessica arrived to find him telling a story as I slept on his bed.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977817" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>"They're so good when they're sleeping."</p><p>– Jessica on our sons</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416978858" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>Me: If I could read your mind, what would I see?</p><p>7 yo: A giant cinema with lots of things playing at once.</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416977811" data-source="twitter"><div><p>If you had asked me when I was younger to to make a list of valuable skills, I probably wouldn't have included the ability to notice anomalies, but I'm increasingly convinced this is one of the most valuable skills of all.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977808" data-source="twitter"><div><p>The idea of spending (small amounts of) "quality time" with your kids is dangerously mistaken, because the best moments happen at completely random times. You not only can't predict them, you may not even know they've happened.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977805" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Explained to my 10 yo why ambitious people tend to have a higher ratio of ability/arrogance at 25 than 21. Real-world tests simultaneously decrease their arrogance and increase their ability.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977801" data-source="twitter"><div><p>When I was a kid, I thought mistakes were simply bad, and to be avoided. As an adult I realized many problems are best solved by working in two phases, one in which you let yourself make mistakes, followed by a second in which you aggressively fix them.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977797" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Trick that delights 7 year olds (n=1): Show how you can draw a pyramid with any shape base by drawing a polygon, drawing a dot above it, and drawing a line from each corner of the polygon to the dot.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976691" data-source="twitter"><div><p>One thing you learn after having kids is what's the biggest favor you can do for anyone with kids: something that helps their kids.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976402" data-source="twitter"><div><p>7 yo was surprised to learn that the 5 second rule has no basis in biology. But when I imitated a bunch of germs seeing food fall and counting to 5 before jumping on it, he had to admit it was pretty implausible.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976396" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Parenting trick: When one of our kids does something really good (usually but not always at school) we give them the "royal treatment." For the next couple days, all the rules are slightly bent. Stay up late? Candy with breakfast? Ok, since they're getting the royal treatment.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976393" data-source="twitter"><div><p>One way to tell what your kids have an aptitude for is what kinds of advice they listen to eagerly. This probably works for adults too, but not as well, because adults have learned to be diligent about things that bore them.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976387" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Your parents miss you and wish you'd call. Later you'll miss them and wish you could.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976382" data-source="twitter"><div><p>You could make a case that it's a step forward that our kids play with virtual toys (= video games) rather than physical ones. If video games hadn't taken off, maybe we'd be complaining kids were so literal-minded they had to have actual physical toys</p></div></li><li data-id="416976379" data-source="twitter"><div><p>My 10 year old asked how to be good at things. I told him that how good people were at something depended on: (a) natural ability, (b) practice, and (c) how into it they were.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976376" data-source="twitter"><div><p>When your child is 5, the two of you are actors in a play. When he's 10, it's more often the case that he and his friends are the actors, and you are the stage crew. One tends to mess up this transition. My trick is to make a conscious effort to notice which times I'm stage crew.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976368" data-source="twitter"><div><p>"I asked children and parents who'd lived both abroad and here in the States what struck them as the biggest difference. They all said it was the lack of childhood independence in America." <a href="https://t.co/nHrJZ2UloZ" target="_blank">reason.com/archives/2019/…</a></p></div></li><li data-id="416975990" data-source="twitter"><div><p>One of the most surprising things about being a parent is the amount you have to improvise. Way more than in anything else I've done, despite this being probably the most commonly done thing I've done. I think it's because kids are incomparable generators of chaos.</p></div></li><li data-id="416975877" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Surprised to find (n=2 admittedly) that it's more motivating for kids to think of their distinctive qualities as mutations than as part of some family tradition.</p></div></li><li data-id="416972377" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Surprising discovery: when you talk to 9 year old boys about their career interests, you have to ask about their second choice, because most plan to become professional athletes.</p></div></li><li data-id="416972372" data-source="twitter"><div><p>New game 6 yo loves: I carry him in the same clumsy way that he carries our (very patient) cat.</p></div></li></div><div id="j-column-2"><li data-id="425697770" data-source="twitter"><div><p>When writing programs in Basic (I'm teaching it to my son), I find I want to put a lot more comments in the code. The comments are roughly English translations of the program I'd write in a powerful language, and my source code is roughly the resulting object code.</p></div></li><li data-id="423829660" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>Two principles I've been teaching my 11 yo about programming:</p><p>1. Whenever you change a program, test it.</p><p>2. Adjust the size of your changes based on your confidence. Start with small changes. When those work, you can make bigger ones.</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="423114264" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Something I taught my 11 yo today: Some amount of programming consists of copying and pasting lines you've already written, and then changing a few parameters. But the better the language, the less of this you do.</p></div></li><li data-id="419840167" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Good activity if you're home with little kids who like telling stories: let them dictate stories that you type for them. For younger kids the physical act of writing is the bottleneck, so this liberates their imagination.</p></div></li><li data-id="416372306" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Something I explained to my 10 yo last night: Some areas of science and technology will advance a lot more than others in the next 50 years, and you can't predict which. All we can say for sure about the future is that some things will change a lot, and others hardly at all.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978523" data-source="twitter"><div><p>My 7 yo grades my bedtime stories, and though I should know better, I find these grades highly motivating. I'm still on a high from getting an A+ on last night's. And a B- I got several months ago still rankles.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978519" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Explained to nervous 7 yo that me being on the floor above is the same as me being in the next room, just rotated 90 degrees. After trying various objections, he had to agree.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978517" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Explained to my sons that war is actually horrible, but boys think it's exciting because they imagine it's like their lion-cubs-wrestling version of fighting writ large, and no one wants to give them nightmares by telling them what it's really like.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978513" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Something I taught my 10 yo: If you're naturally competitive, instead of spreading a thin layer of it across all of life, pile it up in a few specific areas and just relax in the rest.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978510" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Something I taught my 7 yo on the way to school: Don't underestimate how many people you can help. One person can help thousands of other people.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977933" data-source="twitter"><div><p>10 yo asked what age kids are the most difficult for parents. Told him newborns are the most overall load, but teenagers cause the highest spikes, because they have the highest ratio of power to judgment.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977822" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Interesting game to play with kids: do back of the envelope calculations about what percentage of sentences have ever been said (on Earth), and encourage them to invent short sentences that probably never have been.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977819" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Watching people staring at their phones at the table in restaurants reminds me of the old days when people smoked at the table in restaurants. Except now whole families are doing it.</p></div></li><li data-id="416978859" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>Asked 7 yo how many Star Wars characters he could name. He named 59. </p><p>Measured by space occupied in his brain, Star Wars is his Greek myths.</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416977815" data-source="twitter"><div><div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/BlasMoros" target="_blank">@BlasMoros</a> What I did in the very earliest phases, before language, was to focus on interesting them visually. It became a sort of test for me, to be able to show a baby something interesting even with very little to work with. E.g. crunch up a piece of paper, then carefully unfold it.</p></div></div></li><li data-id="416977810" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Well-meaning teachers encourage my kids to use more "vocabulary" words in their writing. I tell them that on this one point they can ignore their teachers, because the best writing uses the simplest possible words.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977807" data-source="twitter"><div><p>When I teach my kids about popular delusions, I teach them not just that they're false, but more importantly, why people want to believe they're true. Then when new delusions arise they'll recognize the pattern.</p></div></li><li data-id="416977804" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>Something I taught a 7 yo today: </p><p>Most of making things is figuring out why they don't work.</p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416977799" data-source="twitter"><div><div><div><p>What you want is not identical with what makes you happy. Though the article doesn't mention it, the scary thing is that as technology for delivering what you want becomes more refined, the two may *increasingly* diverge. </p><p><a href="https://t.co/oMcQ2JioVa" target="_blank">bloomberg.com/opinion/articl…</a></p></div></div></div></li><li data-id="416977796" data-source="twitter"><div><div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/simonsarris" target="_blank">@simonsarris</a> When my kids tell me things I didn't know, I always make a big deal about it in order to encourage them to learn more such things.</p></div></div></li><li data-id="416976536" data-source="twitter"><div><p>When I put our boys to bed, it sometimes takes an hour. In theory I'm lax for letting it drag on so long. But it's the best part of the day for all of us, because we're all together with no distractions.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976401" data-source="twitter"><div><div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/codinghorror" target="_blank">@codinghorror</a> I think programming is up there with the most important sorts of knowledge, like math and the hard sciences, history, and how to write. When you look at the world, you see more if you understand these things.</p></div></div></li><li data-id="416976395" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Something I wish I'd done while my mother was still alive: I wish I'd written an essay, just for myself, about what she was like as a person. I knew her pretty well, but I'd know her better if I'd had to observe her and ask her questions in order to describe her in writing.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976391" data-source="twitter"><div><p>This made my day. I would not ordinarily link to something someone wrote about me, but it makes me so happy to remember those mornings. <a href="https://t.co/GWmqCAFK5a" target="_blank">quora.com/What-was-the-b…</a></p></div></li><li data-id="416976386" data-source="twitter"><div><p>One of the surprising things about being a parent is the degree to which the instinctive protectiveness that kicks in transfers to other kids. You don't just notice when your kid gets too near the curb; you notice when any kid does.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976381" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Good game to play with small children: go through the alphabet naming some category of things (countries, animals, professional football players) beginning with each letter.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976378" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Parents inevitably supply mostly don't because kids supply so much do.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976374" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Good thing to do with a 6 yo: type stories they dictate. At that age, the physical act of writing is a bottleneck, so this can release a torrent of imagination. They love seeing their stories printed, like "real" stories they read in books. And it's a fun thing to do together.</p></div></li><li data-id="416976336" data-source="twitter"><div><p>It's a curious situation that blank-slate ideology is becoming more de rigueur in certain circles at exactly the point in history when the most interesting discoveries in the other direction are being made. I believe it's a coincidence, but maybe not.</p></div></li><li data-id="416975938" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Big fight between 9 yo and 6 yo because both wanted to read the same book in bed. Suggested they get in one bed and read alternate pages out loud. Seems to have worked. Not sure how this ends in sleep, but that is often the case when I leave them at night.</p></div></li><li data-id="416972396" data-source="twitter"><div><p>One of the best things you can be for your kids is an audience. Which doesn't mean being uncritically approving. That doesn't fool kids over 2. It means caring about what they care about.</p></div></li><li data-id="416972374" data-source="twitter"><div><p>Little kids are taught to think of generosity as sacrifice, which makes it unappealing. It may also work to lead them down the slippery slope starting with self-interest. E.g. footballers willing to pass are much harder to defend against.</p></div></li><li data-id="416972371" data-source="twitter"><div><p>When my older son was 5, the teacher asked the children to each describe how they prayed. My son said he would dig a hole, hide in it till an animal walked by, and then jump out and kill it.</p></div></li></div></div></div></div></div>
