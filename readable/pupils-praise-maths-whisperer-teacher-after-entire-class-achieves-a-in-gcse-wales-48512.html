  <p>A school in Cardiff is celebrating after an entire class achieved A* in their maths GCSE, after sitting the exam six months early. </p>

<p>The Year 11 group at Fitzalan High School now refer to teacher Francis Elive as "the maths whisperer" as some of the class even came close to achieving full marks</p>

  <p>Tiger By Juniors FC said on Twitter: "Fitzalan and our pupils making history again</p>

<p>"Francis is a legend of a teacher. This is a great achievement for our local school. This is an indicator of the direction we are heading. Onwards and upwards."</p>

<p>Another said: "As much as Iâ€™m a believer of it not being all about grades, this is an awesome indictment of the pupils, their teacher and the school as a whole. Well done, everyone."</p>

<p>The Fitzalan Maths department said: "We couldn't be prouder of this class and Mr Elive. They've demonstrated that preparation, hard work and dedication pay off."</p>

</div>
<p>The school says raising achievement of "all its pupils" is a "top priority" and it aims to be one of the top achieving schools in Wales. </p>
