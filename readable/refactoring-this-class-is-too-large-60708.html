    An example of refactoring from a real (flawed) code base. 
  </p><p><i>    
    In this article I walk through a
    set of refactorings from a real code base. 
    This is not intended to demonstrate perfection, but it does represent reality.
  </i></p><div>
<p>
      This is a story about refactoring.
      It's the third item in the TDD 
      <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/workflowsOfRefactoring/#tdd"> red-green-refactor cycle</a><span><a href="#footnote-tdd">[1]</a></span> and it's
      the thing we do all the time, right? Except when we don't.
    </p>

<p>
      I have an unruly code base which has suffered from refactoring neglect, so I've 
      been bringing it back into line. 
      In this article I will take a <i>class that is too large</i>, and make it smaller.
    </p>



<section id="OutlineOfTheProblem">
<h2>Outline of the problem</h2>

<p>The story begins with a boring domestic chore. I've written some
      personal accounting software - <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/tree/Refactor-examples">Reconciliate</a>.
      It works on the
      command line and performs the following actions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loads my own comma-separated data:
          
<ul>
<li>My record of recent bank and credit card transactions.</li>

<li>My predicted monthly and annual transactions (based on data in a
        central spreadsheet).</li>

<li>Any unreconciled previously-recorded data.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Loads third-party comma-separated data (from bank and credit card companies).</li>

<li>Reconciles the third-party data against my own data.</li>

<li>Writes everything back to a central spreadsheet.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have some bugs that need fixing and some features to add. But my
      typical workflow is to arrive at the laptop late at night after putting my
      youngest to bed, with only a small amount of time before it will be <i>my</i>
      bedtime, and often a few weeks after the last time I saw the code. In
      these circumstances it's horribly easy to think things like, "Well I know
      this code is a mess, but I don't have time to get my head round it and fix
      it now..."</p>

<p>Clearly this is not ideal.</p>

<p>There's one class in particular - the <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class 
      - which is giving me a headache
      whenever I look at it. It's bloated and convoluted and impossible to <i>fit
      in my head</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="#footnote-fits-in-my-head">[2]</a></span>. This has created a nasty 
      feedback loop: "Because this code is 
      so hard to reason about, refactoring will take more time and energy than I
      have, so I'll put up with it even longer - even though it means I can't
      even make small changes any more because it takes so long for me to
      understand the code's current state and decide where the change should
      go." </p>

<p>For instance, I want to add the ability to handle another credit card.
      In a lot of places I've used
      <a href="https://medium.com/@shanikae/polymorphism-explained-simply-7294c8deeef7">polymorphism</a>
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">the strategy pattern</a>
      to keep the unique behaviour of each credit card neatly encapsulated. But
      the <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class is one place where, because of the poor
      design of the code and the lack of clear 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">context separation</a>, 
      if I add another
      credit card I'll be making an already bloated class even worse. It
      contains four duplicated code paths for each of four types of data (Bank In,
      Bank Out, Credit Card 1 and Credit Card 2), and if I add Credit Card 3
      right now I'll end up following the same anti-pattern.</p>

<p>My overall aim is to replace this code with more generic
      code, via the strategy pattern <span><a href="#footnote-refactoring-to-patterns">[3]</a></span>. 
      But there are four problems standing in my way:</p>

<ol>
<li>This one large class, (<code>ReconciliationIntro</code>), is taking too
        much responsibility.</li>

<li>There's a lot of private nested code, which is hard to unit-test
        because it has no public interface.</li>

<li>Within <code>ReconciliationIntro</code>, there's one large method that's doing
        too much.</li>

<li>There are several methods in <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> which use the
        same repeated pattern but with different details.</li>
</ol>

<p>
        I plan to fix all of these problems, in the order listed above. 
        This <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/preparatory-refactoring-example.html">preparatory refactoring</a>
        will get me to the point where I can easily encapsulate the behaviour of each credit 
        card / account. As <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/250733358307500032?s=20">Kent Beck says</a>, 
        "Make the change easy, then make the easy change." 
      </p>

<p>
        This article is about tackling the first problem in the above list: <i>This class is too
        large</i>.
      </p>
</section>

<section id="WhyRefactor">
<h2>Why refactor?</h2>

<p>I can't easily reason about the <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class because it
      has too many responsibilities. It was originally designed as the
      entrance hall to the software, and all it did was display a few messages
      and then instantiate the classes that do the main work.
      But over time a lot of other code has snuck in. I want to make it easier to add 
      another credit card, so I'm going to start
      by <i>breaking this large class into smaller classes</i>.</p>

<p>The benefits will be several:</p>

<ul>
<li>By moving groups of methods into separate classes I'll create clear 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">contexts</a> and minimise tight coupling. 
        This means that:</li>

<ul>
<li>I'll know where to go when I want to make changes or fix issues.</li>

<li>When I amend the code, I'll only have to work with small
          isolated sections that fit in my head <span><a href="#footnote-fits-in-my-head">[2]</a></span>
          - I won't have to understand
          the whole system.</li>

<li>Any manipulation of state will only happen locally in a small context
          - so I won't have to worry about one area of the system changing state in
          another.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="how">


<h2>How do I do it? </h2>

<p>To my
      mind, the most important principle when refactoring (and when writing new
      code) is to move in tiny steps. I have several connected aims:</p>

<ul>
<li>At every step, I want the code to compile and the tests to run.</li>

<li>If a change causes any tests to fail, I want to be able to fix them
        instantly. By making small changes and small commits, I can see which
        change caused the tests to fail and I only need to rewind / examine a
        small amount of code to find the problem.</li>

<li>I can keep track of where I am in in my head. It's horribly easy to
        embark on a relatively simple refactor, only to find it has repercussions
        beyond your original intention. At this point, if you're not in the habit
        of keeping the code compiling and the tests passing at every step, you can
        find yourself lost in a rabbit hole that's difficult to exit: Your
        code isn't compiling and your tests aren't even running, let alone passing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
        For this to work, I need the code being refactored to be
        covered by tests. This has already been done before I start refactoring, 
        although it's worth noting
        that one of my aims in a future refactoring will be to make the code even
        more testable.
      </p>

<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring, by Martin Fowler</a> is a recommended
        further read and lays out some basic refactoring principles. He also emphasises
        the value of moving in tiny steps and building the code / running your 
        tests after every small commit.
      </p>

<p>Beyond these basic principles, I'll aim to follow a logical series of
      steps which are outlined below.</p>


</section>

<section id="rearrange-methods">
<h2>1. Rearrange methods</h2>

<p>I'll start by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-region">regions</a> to rearrange all the
      methods in the <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/blob/Refactor-genericise-start/Console/Reconciliation/ReconciliationIntro.cs"><code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class</a> into sensible
      groupings&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/f2d9932">commit f2d9932</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>:</p>

<div id="class-split-into-regions-v2.png"><p><img src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/class-too-large/class-split-into-regions-v2.png"></p><p>Figure 1: ReconciliationIntro after
      methods rearranged into regions</p>
</div>





<p>Now that I've grouped my methods into what feels like a reasonable set of 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">contexts</a>, 
      I'd like to pull these out into separate classes. But where to
      start? The file loading code contains the most duplication, and is causing the
      most pain. Ultimately I want to make this code more generic, but first I want to
      pull it out so I can see it without distraction. I'll extract a new <code>FileLoader</code>
      class. The other groupings will also become separate classes but they'll be a
      lot simpler, so I'll focus most of this article on the file-loading code.</p>
</section>

<section id="analyse-rels">


<h2>2. Analyse relationships between file-loading methods</h2>

<p>So far all I've done is move some code around in the same class. I
      rebuilt the code and ran all the tests before I committed, but unless I
      was clumsy I'd expect my previous commit to be trivial. I need to be a
      little more thoughtful about what I do next.</p>

<p>I've used one of my regions to identify methods to pull out into 
      a new <code>FileLoader</code>
      class, but how can I be sure this will work? Are there any hidden
      dependencies? I'll discover this by drawing out the relationships
      between the methods I want to move. The ones to be moved are marked in
      blue.</p>





<p>I can see straight away that it's not a strictly self-contained 
      context: Some of the
      blue methods are calling back out to methods (shown in black and green) that I want to
      keep in a separate class. There are a couple of ways I could handle this, which
      I <a href="#modify-staying">discuss below</a>. But now I'm at
      a place where I can define a plan of action. </p>
</section>

<section id="PlanOfAction">
<h2>Plan of action</h2>

<p> By the time I'm done, the original large <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class 
      will have been broken down into 
      the pared-down version plus five new classes shown in 
      the diagram below. Note that there isn't a one-to-one mapping between
      regions and classes, because later on when I reach 
      <a href="#extract-more-classes">step 7</a>, I'll end up refining my first groupings 
      into some finer-grained boundaries.</p>

<div id="MasterPlan-darker-text-taller.png"><p><img src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/class-too-large/MasterPlan-darker-text-taller.png"></p><p>Figure 4: Plan of action</p>
</div>



<p>
        My overall aim is to break this large class down into smaller classes.
        In steps 1 and 2 above, I used <a href="#rearrange-methods">regions</a> 
        and <a href="#analyse-rels">a diagram</a> to identify distinct areas of 
        code and then analyse relationships between some of the methods. That gave me enough 
        information to start thinking about how I can tackle this job in tiny steps. 
      </p>

<p>
        The resulting plan is summarised below and then described in detail further down. 
        I reached this plan by thinking about how I could 
        proceed using steps that were <a href="#how">as small as possible</a>. Often what I'm 
        doing is setting things up so that the <i>next</i> change will be 
        as small and simple as possible. I'm making small 
        changes to facilitate more small changes - yet again following 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/250733358307500032?s=20">Kent Beck's dictum</a> to 
        "Make the change easy, then make the easy change."
      </p>

<p>
        Depending on your circumstances 
        you might not follow the same plan, but it's not a bad template if you're not sure how to proceed. 
        Your priority is to set yourself up for safe incremental changes:
      </p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="#rearrange-methods">Rearrange methods</a></p>

<p>Group all the methods in the class into sensible groupings, as described
          <a href="#rearrange-methods">above</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="#analyse-rels">Analyse
          relationships between file-loading methods</a></p>

<p>Identify how the
          file-loading code is connected to the rest of the code in 
          the <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class, as
          described <a href="#analyse-rels">above</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="#modify-staying">Modify the
          methods that are staying behind</a></p>

<p>There are methods which
          will stay in the parent class but are currently called by those that are
          moving. Some modification will be required to make this work.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="#covering-tests">Create covering
          tests for the new <code>FileLoader</code> class</a></p>

<p>The new <code>FileLoader</code> class
          needs to be covered by tests. The tests for the code to be moved already
          exist, but they'll be moved into a new <code>FileLoaderTests</code> class.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="#create-fileloader">Create new
          <code>FileLoader</code> class and move two methods</a></p>

<p><a href="#how">Following the principle of tiny steps</a>, I'll move
          just two methods (a public method and a private method called by it)
          before I move the rest.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="#move-methods">Move the other
          methods to the new <code>FileLoader</code> class</a></p>

<p>This is where it gets
          exciting. All that file-loading code I'm interested in will finally
          get a new home!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="#extract-more-classes">Extract more new classes</a></p>

<p>Once I've dealt with the file-loading code, I'll create some more new
          classes for the other code regions. </p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The new <code>FileLoader</code> class will be responsible for loading various
      sources of comma-separated data and merging them ready for reconciliation.
      This file-loading code is where most of the pain currently lies, so that's the 
      bit I'll describe in the most detail. 
      You can see the original code before refactoring <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/blob/Refactor-genericise-start/Console/Reconciliation/ReconciliationIntro.cs">here</a>, but if you follow that link all you'll
      learn is that it's too big to fit in your head! The slimmed down
      post-refactor version is <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/blob/Refactor-examples/Console/Reconciliation/ReconciliationIntro.cs">here</a>.</p>

<p>So, now I can continue with the plan:</p>
</section>

<section id="modify-staying">
<h2>3. Modify the methods that are staying behind</h2>

<p>I've identified two methods - <code>Set_path</code> and
      <code>Recursively_ask_for_budgeting_months</code> - which are called by file-loading
      methods:</p>





<p>As long as those methods are not too tightly coupled with the
      file-loading class, I can either</p>

<ul>
<li>Make them public so I can call back to them from
        the new <code>FileLoader</code> class.</li>

<li>Move the calls out of the file-loading code and into other native
        <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> methods instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll use the first approach for <code>Recursively_ask_for_budgeting_months</code> and 
      the second for <code>Set_path</code>, which will bring me to the following situation:</p>





<p>Note that the methods marked as <code>FileLoader</code> methods in the diagram
      will still be in the <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class at the end of this step,
      but this will <i>enable</i> me to move them into the <code>FileLoader</code> class, which
      will happen in <a href="#create-fileloader">step 5</a> 
      and <a href="#move-methods">step 6</a> below.</p>

<p><code>Recursively_ask_for_budgeting_months</code> will eventually be a public
      method in another class, but for now I just want to make sure I can call
      it from elsewhere. It turns out it already is public, which was done so
      that it could be tested. This in itself is a code smell - it's a sign
      that it would be better off as part of the public interface of a separate
      class.</p>

<p>The other method called from the file-loading code is <code>Set_path</code>. This
      changes the value of an internal path variable, so I'll choose option 2:
      I'll call it separately and pass the resulting data into the file-loading
      method via a parameter. </p>



<p>Note that these might not normally stay as separate commits (I could use
      micro-commits and then squash them into larger commits), but I'm keeping
      the small commits intact to make the steps clear. I compile and run the
      tests at every step:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
            Modify the calling method (<code>Create_pending_csvs</code>) so that it takes a
            parameter, but initially give it a default value 
            (<a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/acc3519">commit acc3519</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span> so
            that the code still compiles:
          </p>

<div>
<pre>private void Create_pending_csvs()
{
  // Some code
}
</pre>
<p><span>⇓</span></p><pre>private void Create_pending_csvs(<span>string path = ""</span>)
{
  // Some code
}
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<p>
            Call <code>Set_path</code> separately before calling <code>Create_pending_csvs</code>.
            Take the resulting new <code>_path</code> member variable (see <a href="#one-thing">sidebar</a>), and pass
            it into <code>Create_pending_csvs</code> (<a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/c5ebc2f">commit c5ebc2f</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>:
          </p>

<div>
<pre>case "1":
{
  Create_pending_csvs();
}
break;
</pre>
<p><span>⇓</span></p><pre>case "1":
{
  Set_path();
  Create_pending_csvs(<span>_path</span>);
}
break;
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<p>
            Remove the call to <code>Set_path</code> from within
            <code>Create_pending_csvs</code>, and use the passed-in value instead of
            the member variable (<a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/6df8f97">commit 6df8f97</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>:
          </p>

<div>
<pre>private void Create_pending_csvs(string path = "")
{
  try
  {
    Set_path();
    var pending_csv_file_creator = new PendingCsvFileCreator(_path);
</pre>
<p><span>⇓</span></p><pre>private void Create_pending_csvs(string path = "")
{
  try
  {
    <span>Set_path();</span>
    var pending_csv_file_creator = new PendingCsvFileCreator(<span>path</span>);
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<p>
            Finally, remove the default value from the <code>Create_pending_csvs</code>
            parameter - thereby forcing all clients to pass a value in 
            (<a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/2be56ea">commit 2be56ea</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>.
            Note that by doing things in this order, I keep the code compiling at all
            times: 
          </p>

<div>
<pre>private void Create_pending_csvs(string path = "")
{
  // Some code

<h2>4. Create covering tests for the new <code>FileLoader</code> class</h2>

<p>My first choice of method to move will be
      <code>Bank_and_bank_out_ _Merge_bespoke_data_with_pending_file</code>. And the first
      thing I want to do is copy any covering tests into a new test class for
      the about-to-be-created <code>FileLoader</code> class. There is already one test
      for this method -
      <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate-git-experiments/blob/f374fbdbf695a590ba7f7e3cd61a506222b742f0/ConsoleCatchallTests/Reconciliation/Loaders/BankAndBankOutDataTests.cs#L79">M_MergeBespokeDataWithPendingFile_ 
      WillAddMostRecentCredCardDirectDebits</a>
      - and its job is to make sure this method merges new direct debit data
      correctly with a 'pending' file (which is being built to contain all new
      transaction data). </p>

<p>Note that I'm only <i>moving</i> tests, not writing new ones. People can
      get so used to the TDD <span><a href="#footnote-tdd">[1]</a></span> concept of writing tests 
      before writing code that
      they assume you need to write new tests <i>whenever you work on code</i>.
      This is often not the case when refactoring. Ideally my functionality
      will already be covered by tests, and when refactoring I'm not changing
      the functionality. So instead of writing new tests, I'm using the existing ones
      to verify the functionality still works as originally intended.</p>

<p>This is a good time to review this test: It's a while since I wrote
      it, so I should be able to spot quickly whether it makes sense. I want
      my tests to be clear and easy to read - they should act as documentation
      for my system behaviour. The first thing I notice is that it contains an
      assert method - <code>Assert_direct_debit_details_are_correct</code> - whose name
      is inadequate. What is the definition of "correct"? I rewrite the test
      to make it easier to read, which involves quite a lot of changes. In the
      interest of keeping this a digestible read I won't go into the changes
      made, but you can view them in <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/f090f26">commit f090f26</a>
      and <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/6a6cece">commit 6a6cece</a>. <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Now that I've refactored the test I'll copy it into a new test
      class, along with some associated private helper methods. Note that
      although this and other tests are destined to operate on a new
      <code>FileLoader</code> class, they'll still act on the old <code>ReconciliationIntro</code>
      class until I'm sure my new test class has everything it needs. Also
      note that until everything is safely moved, my test code is duplicated.
      </p>



<p>I first create the new test class in the same file as the original
      (<a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/491c795">commit 491c795</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>, so that it's easy to see what I'm copying.
      Then I can get <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper</a>&nbsp;<span><a href="#footnote-resharper">[5]</a></span> and Visual Studio to move everything into a new file for
      me (<a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/c9317c0">commit c9317c0</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>.</p>

<section id="create-fileloader">
<h2>5. Create new <code>FileLoader</code> class and move two methods</h2>

<p>Now that my test class is up and running, I can create the new
      <code>FileLoader</code> class. </p>

<p>The method that's furthest down the chain - the lowest leaf in <a href="#modify-staying">my
      tree of methods</a> - is
      <code>Bank_and_bank_out__ Add_most_recent_credit_card_direct_debits</code>. This is
      a private method with no independent tests (it's tested via the public
      calling method), so I'm going to move both it and its caller
      (<code>Bank_and_bank_out__ Merge_bespoke_data_with_pending_file</code>). These will
      be the first two methods to be moved into my new class. </p>

<p>Again, I'll move in baby steps to avoid my tests going red and keep
      my code building at all times. After each of the following steps I make
      sure the code builds and the tests are passing.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
            This is the situation I begin with. A <code>FileLoaderTests</code> class has
            been created, but it is testing code that still lives in the
            <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class:
          </p>




</li>

<li>
<p>
            I start by creating a new <code>FileLoader</code> class. One of my file-loading methods
            (<code>Bank_and_bank_out__ Add_most_recent_credit_card_direct_debits</code>) is
            private, and will also be private at the end of this process. It will only ever be called by 
            the method that's about to follow it into the new class. It's not
            individually covered by tests, so I can just copy it over to the new
            class and have it ready and waiting when its caller is moved 
            (see <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/0341476">commit 0341476</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>. 
            But I will need to make it temporarily public:
          </p>




</li>

<li>
<p>
            Now I can create an instance of my new <code>FileLoader</code> class in the 
            <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class and call its new public method, instead 
            of the old private method. I can also delete the old private method 
            (see <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/bde2ae2">commit bde2ae2</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>:
          </p>




</li>

<li>
<p>
            Copy the original caller into the new class 
            (see <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/f0a5a59">commit f0a5a59</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>. 
            Note that at this point it's duplicated:
          </p>




</li>

<li>
<p>
            Change the object I'm testing from being a <code>ReconciliationIntro</code>
            instance to being a new <code>FileLoader</code> instance. Point the tests at the new copy 
            of the original caller. Note that because the private method it calls has also been copied, my
            tests will pass (see <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/3d573e3">commit 3d573e3</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>:
          </p>




</li>

<li>
<p>
            Now I can call the original caller directly from the <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> 
            class (see <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/77c0b14">commit 77c0b14</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>:
          </p>




</li>

<li>
<p>
            Make the originally-private method private again, and delete the original caller. 
            I'll delete the old test class too, as all its tests have now been duplicated 
            in <code>FileLoaderTests</code>.
            (see <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/27f1a59">commit 27f1a59</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>:
          </p>




</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="move-methods">
<h2>6. Move the other methods to the new <code>FileLoader</code> class</h2>

<p>Now I can move all the other methods. I'll handle them one by one,
      starting with the simplest and keeping an eye out for dependencies
      (between methods, and on any member data). I'll need to consider the
      following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I want to rename any methods?</li>

<li>Do I want to replace any parameter lists with new objects?</li>

<li>Are there any redundant parameters?</li>

<li>Are any of the internal nested callees altering state? What impact
        does this have?</li>
</ul>

<p>I could inline those lower down in the chain before moving them, but
      if I did I'd break the tests which call them as public methods. So
      instead I move them on their own. I do it in the order explained below,
      acting on one at a time and starting with those at the end of the chain
      - ie the outermost leaves on the following tree:</p>





<p>For each one, I use the following approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a copy of the method in the destination class, keeping the
        original in place. Make the new method public.</li>

<li>Call the new method instead of the original.</li>

<li>Copy any covering tests into the new test class, and make sure
        they test the new code.</li>

<li>Delete the old method and the old tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>I already moved
      <code>Bank_and_bank_out__ Merge_bespoke_data_with_pending_file</code> and
      <code>Bank_and_bank_out__ Add_most_recent_credit_card_direct_debits</code>
      (<a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/0341476">commit 0341476</a> to <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/27f1a59">commit 27f1a59</a>), 
      so now I repeat the same actions for each of the other
      methods (<a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/7cd53f6">commit 7cd53f6</a> 
      to <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/7ab95f2">commit 7ab95f2</a>) <span><a href="#footnote-commits-not-compulsory">[4]</a></span>. I don't
      commit every tiny step this time, but I still go through the same set of
      steps. After each step, I make sure the code builds and the tests are
      passing (apart from when I deliberately make a test fail).
      </p>

<p>I refactored some tests earlier, and I can repeat those changes for 
      tests that follow the same
      pattern. For some methods the move is very simple, because they have no
      test coverage. This is part of why I'm doing this refactor, to
      make that code more easily testable.</p>

<section id="Recap">
<h2>Recap</h2>



<p><i>My class was too large</i>. I had developed undesirable coding habits 
      and I wanted
      to stop and make things better before adding any new functionality.</p>

<p>To fix my too-large class, I took the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#rearrange-methods">Rearranged methods</a> into
        sensible groupings, to help identify new classes.</li>

<li><a href="#analyse-rels">Analysed
        relationships between file-loading methods</a>, so that I could work out
        how to create a new <code>FileLoader</code> class with minimum coupling
        with the rest of the code.</li>

<li><a href="#modify-staying">Modified
        the methods that were staying behind</a>, so that they could be called
        by those that are moving (if necessary).</li>

<li><a href="#covering-tests">Created covering
        tests for the new <code>FileLoader</code> class</a>, by creating a new
        <code>FileLoaderTests</code> class.</li>

<li><a href="#create-fileloader">Created the new
        <code>FileLoader</code> class and moved two methods</a>.</li>

<li><a href="#move-methods">Moved the other
        methods to the new <code>FileLoader</code> class</a>.</li>

<li><a href="#extract-more-classes">Extracted more new classes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I <a href="#how">moved in tiny steps</a>, and I compiled and ran the
      tests at every step. Now I have a much smaller class which calls
      functionality from several other also-smaller classes, and each one of 
      them is easier to fit in my head.</p>
</section>

<section id="WhatsNext">
<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>Note that this article ends in the middle of the refactor, so if you
      want to see the relevant state of the code before moving on to the next
      steps, you need to 
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout">checkout</a> the <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/6103f0b">commit 6103f0b</a>.
      Note also that I completed most of <a href="#extract-more-classes">step 7</a>
      in this article <i>after</i> that commit (explanation
      <a href="#order">here</a>).</p>

<p>At <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/6103f0b">commit 6103f0b</a>, 
      I've pulled the file-loading code out into the <code>FileLoader</code> class and have
      a clearer view of the main challenge. 
      The following four methods (visible in situ <a href="https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/blob/6103f0b7076291882a43acca368075135f407498/Console/Reconciliation/Loaders/FileLoader.cs#L111">here</a>) 
      are clearly problematic:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Load_bank_and_bank_in</code></li>

<li><code>Load_bank_and_bank_out</code></li>

<li><code>Load_cred_card1_and_cred_card1_in_out</code></li>

<li><code>Load_cred_card2_and_cred_card2_in_out</code></li>
</ul>

<p>They have the following problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a lot of duplication - at a glance, they look identical.</li>

<li>They are way too long.</li>

<li>They create objects internally and pass them into one another in a
        closely inter-dependent way which is not testable.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all problems I want to solve, but before I do any more
      refactoring I really need some tests around those methods. That's what
      I'll do next. My desire is to write about it in a follow-up article, 
      but I've learnt better than to make promises about that kind of thing, 
      so for now it's an exercise for the reader.</p>
