<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="Coming_Soon!"><a href="#!Coming_Soon!"></a><div><div><p><strong>Are you looking for a VR RPG game with lots of strategic depth?</strong></p><p>You will enjoy <em>Walking Dream</em>, a single-player adventure game targeted for the Oculus Quest in early 2021. This game project led by classic game developer and illustrator Conrad Barski<a href="#fn-1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> combines elements from both old and new RPG games in a completely new way!</p><p>(Also, the project is getting tons of game design help from Dave Pickett of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Hns4aMY1JYLz-3XvLvHDw">BRICK 101</a>)</p></div><p><img src="http://walkingdre.am/vr-wizard.png" alt="vr-wizard"></p><div><p>After falling into a vat of chemicals and being in stasis for 500 years, Derek X wakes up in a post apocalyptic America, strangely mixed up with fantasy creatures. To get back to own time, he will need to use a futuristic toaster to fight many brave battles. This will require him to go on the hunt for ever-more-powerful slices of cybernetic toast to vanquish the many powerful enemies in this new world.</p></div><p><img src="http://walkingdre.am/dream-apocalypse.png" alt="dream-apocalypse"></p><div><p>If you own an Oculus Quest helmet, you'll love <em>Walking Dream</em>: It's been designed 100% for the quest, but is completely different from other Quest games. No other game offers a similar turn-based mechanic, unique weapons crafting system, custom cartoon-style 3d artwork, or a similar <em>redirected walking</em> engine for movement. Expect a completely new type of game for your Quest!</p><p>If you've played old-school RPG games (such as the early Ultima games or Heroes of Might and Magic) you know how different the RPG gameplay was in these games, compared to modern RPG games: This is mainly because the turn-based design of movement and actions in these games allowed the play to be more thoughtful and strategic. Walking Dream brings back this turn-based experience!</p><p>Lots of RPG games feature combat that is almost identical from foe to foe, forcing you to grind through lots of repetitive enemies to defeat the game. Walking Dream, on the other hand, is built on a brand new combat engine with a rich weapons crafting system. This system is shared by both the player as well as the many enemies, and turns each battle into a completely novel experience, requiring completely novel strategies at every encounter!</p></div><p><img src="http://walkingdre.am/output2.gif" alt="output2"></p><div><p>The expansive world of <em>Walking Dream</em> is built using a custom, low poly cartoon modeling system. This allows us to give our game an expansive world, filled with tons of custom artwork with a unique style. Walking Dream is not just another indie game built from prebuilt, cookie-cutter 3d models!</p></div><p><img src="http://walkingdre.am/output.gif" alt="output"></p><div><p>The ultimate dream every player has when using their VR helmet is to simply be able to walk around the world, carefree but also without bumping into the couch of their living room! As its name implies, <em>Walking Dream</em> makes this possible, using a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirected_walking"><em>redirected walking</em></a> engine that uses several new programming tricks to make this type of locomotion more practical than ever before!</p></div><p><img src="http://walkingdre.am/walking-dream-logo.png" alt="walking-dream-logo"></p><div><p><strong>Release of <em>Walking Dream</em> is planned for early 2021.
