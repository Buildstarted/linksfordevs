		<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Modern dynamic light rendering techniques, such as Clustered shading, are very impressive if you want thousands of lights, and after implementing my own method for rendering scenes with hundreds of lights, I got to thinking about shadows…</p>
<p>What good are all these lights unless many or all of them are casting shadows?</p>
<h3>Eye Candy</h3>
<p>In this scene I have about 120 lights. Each light is omni-directional, so each one uses 6 views to render a cube shadow map, so that is 600+ shadow maps being rendered. All objects are casting shadows. The shadow map resolution is scaled with distance from the camera in order to fit in memory.</p>
<p><span><iframe type="text/html" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uv8s3HhAfoo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" data-ratio="0.5629453681710214" data-width="842" data-height="474"></iframe></span></p>
<p>You can see the shadow maps being rendered in the bottom left.</p>
<p>So… I wanted hundreds of shadows and I set out to solve the problem. I was very impressed by earlier attempts such as Imperfect Shadow Maps and the ManyLods Algorithm but both suffer from holes when rendering large views, and hence, are not suited for rendering high resolution shadow maps. ManyLods can also end up with very deep trees because of the number of points required to represent large triangles.</p>
<p>This led me to a small eureka moment when I realized that there is no point in using a point representation: You can have a BVH of triangles and still get the benefits that the ManyLods algorithm brings – being able to render a node when its projected area is small enough that its children can effectively be ignored, allowing the algorithm to skip large sections of costly BVH traversal.</p>
<p>With a triangle BVH you still have a hierarchical representation that can be used to splat points into the view buffers if the projected area of the BVH node becomes smaller than a pixel. The advantage is that when the traversal gets down to the triangle level you can stop traversal and render the triangle directly to the view buffer – even if the node still has a large view-space projected area. This is where ManyLods would carry on traversing down the tree, potentially to the highest detail level points/surfels, as it requires all nodes that are drawn to either be leaf nodes or to be smaller than some metric in view space.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of pure point based methods is that on modern hardware, rendering points is generally more expensive than rendering triangles, so you only really want to render points if they are going to save you from rendering many small sub-pixel sized triangles.</p>
<p>I call the following algorithm “Many Perfect Shadow Maps” or ManyPSMs for short, as a homage to the Imperfect Shadow Maps and ManyLods algorithms.</p>
<h3>BVH GPU Structure</h3>
<p>The scene and object instance BVHs are all packed into a single GPU Buffer. Object vertex data is stored in a separate buffer.</p>
<p>After all objects’ BVHs are loaded (they are generated offline), they are packed, one after the other, into the GPU Buffer, keeping track of their root nodes’ child indices. Leaf nodes store triangle indices into the vertex buffer. This part of the buffer is static.</p>
<p>During run-time, the dynamic scene BVH is updated and packed into the dynamic part of the same buffer. While packing the scene BVH, if an object instance is encountered, its world transform is packed into an instance buffer, the index to which is stored in the packed scene BVH node, along with child node Indices obtained from the object instance’s static BVH’s root node’s children – allowing a single and simple traversal kernel to traverse the static and dynamic parts of the tree.</p>

<h3><strong>The Algorithm</strong></h3>
<p>So the algorithm is very similar to ManyLods, iteratively traversing the scene BVH for each view in parallel in a compute shader. This is done using a similar Node-View pattern (except it it extended to handle&nbsp;object instances). So the Node-View stores a Node Index, a View Index, and an Object Instance Index. During each iteration, or compute dispatch, one level of the tree is processed, filling buffers and generating indirect dispatch arguments for the next iteration.</p>
<p>First, the initial Node-Views for the scene are created in a GPU Buffer, one initial Node-View is created for each view in the scene, containing that View Index (1 to n) and Index of the root node of the Scene (for example, 21 in the image above) BVH. The Object Instance Index is initially set to 0xffffffff.</p>
<p>A compute shader is then dispatched, once for each level of the tree. Each thread loads a Node-View, and performs one of five tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply Object Instance Transform<br>
</strong>If a <strong>N</strong>ode contains an object instance, the compute kernel needs to load the instance transform and apply it to the view transform. The object instance index is also propagated to any subsequent Node-View traversal steps</li>
<li><strong>Cull</strong><br>
Nodes are culled if they are outside of a cone wrapped around the View’s frustum.</li>
<li><strong>Draw Triangle</strong><br>
If a node contains a triangle, the triangle indices are pushed into an index buffer for later rendering to a triangle splat buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Draw Point</strong><br>
If a node’s estimated projected area is less than or equal to one pixel, it is pushed into a list of points for later rendering to a point splat buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Traverse</strong><br>
If a node can’t be drawn or culled, its children are pushed into a list of Node-Views for processing in the next iteration.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Splatting</h3>
<p>The shadow maps are splatted/rasterized simultaneously with a single draw all to splat all triangles into all views, and a single dispatch to splat all points into all views. The splatting happens on a large texture atlas containing all the shadow maps.</p>
<p>A compute shader is dispatched to splat all the points into views on the point splat buffer. Then a Draw call is made to splat all of the triangles into all views in the triangle splat buffer. Triangle view-clipping is currently done in the pixel shader, but it would be better to move it to a pre-process or geometry shader, as clipping in in the pixel shader is inefficient.</p>
<p>After this, a compute shader is used to merge the results and copy them into cube map arrays for the lights to address while rendering.</p>
<p>Here is another video before the shadow map filtering was fixed:</p>

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<ol>
<li>Triangle splatting: triangles need to be clipped to each view, this is currently being done in the pixel shader, but should really be done in a geometry shader or as some pre-process.</li>
<li>Shadow map filtering: Shadows are currently unfiltered, I would like to try a tri-axis cube map blur.</li>
<li>Better Shadow map representation: I’m currently using VSM, I would like to try MSM or something else.</li>
<li>Optimizations: There is a lot of optimization that could be done to the shaders and render code to improve performance.</li>
<li>Blend between shadow resolutions using mip-maps.</li>
</ol>
