Would they have to bundle it again?<br>For example, let’s assume application <code>Foo.exe</code> uses a library <code>Foo.Common.dll</code>. Now, plugins can be built that use the <code>Foo.Common.dll</code>. The application then has some mechanism to pick these up.</p><p>With the classic approach, or even .NET Framework, the application might have exactly those two outputs: <code>Foo.exe</code> and <code>Foo.Common.dll</code>. And when you create the plugin, you might end up with <code>plugin.dll</code> and <code>Foo.Common.dll</code>. Now since the common library would already be bundled with the application, distributions of the plugin would only have to contain the <code>plugin.dll</code>. You could paste that into the application folder, enable the plugin, and it would work.</p><p>With .NET Core and single-file publishing, this would now mean that both the application and the plugin would bundle <code>Foo.Common.dll</code> and all the runtime dlls into their final output. So you have those twice for this setup. Of course, you could opt in to make the library <em>not</em> bundle into a single file, but the plugin might also have some other dependencies, so it likely would <em>want</em> to bundle into a single file. So in the end, this would require a lot of configuration for the plugin author to produce an efficient output.</p><p>Do you have any thoughts on this situation?</p></div></div></div></div>
