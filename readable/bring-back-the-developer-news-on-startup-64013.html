                            <p><span><p>Just downloaded and installed VS2019.  Looks great so far and I love the new 'Start Page' look... however, I do miss the 'Developer News' section.  I use this religiously to keep up-to-date with what is happening in the MS world.  I know that I can hit the 'File-&gt;Start Page' to open it up but I can guarantee that I will miss things.  Having it open every time I started VS made it "in my face" and hi-lighted the things that I hadn't read yet.  Can you please consider bringing it back?  I feel like the new start page could still come up as a tab with the new fancy UI and still include the 'Developer News' section just like it does in VS2017.  I'm not sure why it was determined that a popup window would be better.  Anyway, just my 2 cents.</p>

                        <p><span><p>I noticed this last week.  While it's certainly better than nothing it's definitely not ideal.  I generally open a new instance of Visual Studio once a day, which guarantees that I would see any updates to the feed very frequently.  However, I only open up the Visual Studio installer as needed.  Maybe once every couple of weeks at most... probably more like once a month on average.  I'd lose a lot of news this way :(.  Please either put it back on the current startup page somehow or just allow the old start page to come up like it was with Preview 1.</p>

Having it added to your Time Savers extension probably makes sense too - you might "prototype" it there and then release it as a stand-alone second (I hadn't heard about your Time Savers extension until this post and it looks like something I'll be adding to my kit anyway - thanks for that!).</p>

I originally thanked Microsoft for bringing it back, but had a go at them because the <em>Developer News</em> had stopped working and there was no UI to correct that. But a Microsoft employee said that they hadn't brought it back, and asked me how I managed to get it back. I couldn't remember doing anything, but now I realise what it was, <em>Time Savers</em>, lol.</p>

While Developer News is important, just getting Developer News to display somewhere in VS2019 does not resolve the fundamental problem of having a MODAL DIALOG without user action being shoved in the user's face, and not having ANY project/solution actions available (except through File menu) when turning that off from Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Environment -&gt; Startup.</p>

Just because devs rant and whine, and act unprofessionally about things doesn't mean they should.  I would hope that you would treat your fellow workers in a professional way and avoid the hysterics, swearing, and berating others.  Stop whining about the issues and move on.  Do you honestly think they provide anything constructive? Do you think that when someone goes off on a rant that Microsoft will somehow take them more seriously?  Just make your case for why the issue is a problem and do so in a professional and courteous manner.  Your feedback would then have more credibility.</p>

And I agree with you, we shouldn't HAVE to, but at least it's now under OUR control, not Microsoft's. Extensions bring us lots of new functionality, and occasionally restore functionality that MS has changed or taken away.</p><p>@icrenegade I think the problems with the Start Window all stemmed from a bad choice of new UI that nobody in MS is prepared to admit was a failure with anyone other than new users.There just wasn't anywhere for them to put Developer News in it and still adhere to their lengthy original justification for introducing it.</p><p>Luckily, developers like myself are not restrained by the same political decisions. I'm working on a Start Page/Window replacement that I've called Start Page+, because it combines the functionality of VS 2017's Start page with that of VS 2019's Start Window, plus a bit more. It is NOT however a <strong>modal</strong> window, it's a document tab. There should be a proof-of-concept preview on the Marketplace very soon.</p><p>EDIT: Start Page+ is now nearing its v1.0 release.</p>

I'm sure that means that they think they have "<em>brought back Developer News</em>". It's unlikely that there'll be anything further from them to address our pleas..</p><p>I've written two extensions that bring the much loved <em>Developer News</em> back; <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=YannDuran.DeveloperNews" target="_blank" tabindex="0">Developer News</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=YannDuran.StartPagePlus" target="_blank" tabindex="0">Start Page+</a>. </p><p><em>Developer News</em> is a tool window that you can dock anywhere you like, view it, hide it, or you can do what I do; I dock it with <em>Team Explorer</em>, which means I can check the news any time I want with just a simple click. If you decide to hide the window, it can be accessed again with <strong>View </strong>| <strong>Developer News</strong>. And it displays the full TEN items that Microsoft currently maintains in its news feed. When Microsoft add new items, they delete older ones.</p><p><em>Start Page+</em> is a replacement for the hated <strong>modal</strong> <em>Start <strong>Window</strong></em>. It brings back what developers loved about the <em>VS 2017 Start Page</em>, including <em>Developer News</em>. And the good news is that it's a <strong>document window </strong>that can be left open or closed or reopened at any time, not a <strong>modal window</strong> that blocks access to anything else. If you've closed the window, it can be opened again with <strong>View </strong>| <strong>Start Page+</strong>.</p><p>Both extensions are great options to "<em>bring back Developer News</em>".</p>

To verify, can you disable it and see it it fixes the issue?</p>

                        <p><span><p>Hey Mads.  Thanks for your typical awesome responsiveness.  You were correct to wonder if I had the other 'News' extension; and in fact I did have it installed.  What I did initially was forget I had it and so I installed the Daily News extension and I got an error upon restarting Visual Studio.  Then I set the VS to Delete (rather than Disable) the other News extension, and restarted Visual Studio, which initiated that removal process.  When it was complete, I restarted Visual Studio and it appeared to hang for a lonnng time.  When it *finally* started again, I had the error that I posted above here.  After I posted that error, I did two things (it might've been nice if I did one and then tested before doing the other, but I did both of these in succession): 1. I rebooted Windows.   2. I started the Visual Studio Installer app and noticed that it was offering the ability to update from 16.6.2 to 16.6.3.  So I updated to VS 16.6.3.   *Then* I restarted Visual Studio 2019.  Boom -- the Daily News extension is working, and working great!</p><p>On a lesser note, do you think it might make sense to have the mouse cursor change to the 'pointer' (hand pointing) cursor when hovering over the title link in the news feed?</p><p>Thanks for all you do for the community.</p>

The steps I took were:</p><ol><li>I deleted the independent "Developer news" extension</li><li>Exited VS to apply the delete change</li><li>Started VS and installed the Basic Essentials extension [don't ask why I didn't already have this installed]</li><li>Exited VS to complete the extension installation</li><li>Downloaded and ran the new Daily News .vsix from the link above</li><li>Started up VS and was greeted with a new "news" tab that defaulted to being open - perfect! :)</li></ol>
