Several weeks I've only been able to release one. I've said I'd try to catch up, and then I'm not able to. Etc etc...</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Well, there's been a specific reason these delays have been happening. The bad news is I can't quite tell you about it yet. The good news is that these delays will be coming to an end soon, and I will be on a more consistent schedule once they do.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I know, vague and mysterious.... but this is my long way of saying that I will not be able to get a second video out this week, but I'll have an explanation as to why I keep getting delayed soon, and soon after that there will no longer be any more delays. Whew.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And don't worry, the series isn't ending. I've seen my share of projects online start to sputter and then end. That's not the case here. A very specific thing is causing me to miss videos, but it won't anymore in short order.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thanks for all your patience, and I'm sorry if I'm disappointing anyone. This project is quite a task, and I'm having a blast figuring out better ways to present the material... but it's still a lot of work.</p></div></div></div></div>
