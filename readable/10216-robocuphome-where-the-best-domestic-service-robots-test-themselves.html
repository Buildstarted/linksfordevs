It is the largest international annual competition for autonomous service robots and is part of the <a href="http://www.robocup.org">RoboCup</a> initiative. A set of benchmark tests is used to evaluate the robots’ abilities and performance in a realistic non-standardized home environment setting. Focus lies on the following domains but is not limited to: Human-Robot-Interaction and Cooperation, Navigation and Mapping in dynamic environments, Computer Vision and Object Recognition under natural light conditions, Object Manipulation, Adaptive Behaviors, Behavior Integration, Ambient Intelligence, Standardization and System Integration. It is colocated with the RoboCup symposium.</p></div><div id="" class=""><h2 class="about">The competition</h2><p class="about">The competition of RoboCup@Home features three leagues and consists of a series of tests which the robots have to solve. The Domestic Standard Platform League focuses on household tasks while the Social Standard Platform League has special interest in the social aspects of human robot interaction, both removing the hardware constraint. In contrast, the The Open Platform League has no hardware restrictions whatsoever and offers the highest degree of freedom when conducting research. The conducted tests will change over the years to become more advanced and function as an overall quality measurement in desired areas. Suggestions for tests can be discussed on the email list. Performance measurement is based on a score derived from competition rules and evaluation by a jury.</p><p class="about">Criteria of the tests are listed below. The tests should:</p><ul><li>include human machine interaction</li><li>be socially relevant</li><li>be application directed/oriented</li><li>be scientifically challenging</li><li>be easy to set up and low in costs</li><li>be simple and have self-explaining rules</li><li>be interesting to watch</li><li>take a small amount of time</li></ul><p class="about noindent">Suggestions for new tests or changes in existing tests should fulfill as many of these criteria as possible.</p><p class="about noindent">Suggestions can be mailed to the @Home email list (see contact information).</p><h3 class="about">The Scenario</h3><p class="about">The ultimate scenario is the real world itself. To build up the required technologies gradually a basic home environment is provided as a general scenario. In the first years (we started in 2006) it will consist of a living room and a kitchen but soon it should also involve other areas of daily life, such as a garden/park area, a shop, a street or other public places.</p><h3 class="about">Open Demonstrations</h3><p class="about">Two of the tests are <i>open demonstrations</i> where freely chosen abilities can be shown. In the <i>“open challenge”</i> teams can freely choose what is demonstrated. In this context, proposals for future tests can be presented to the league. According to the criteria of RoboCup@Home, a jury consisting of team leaders will decide on the score awarded. The <i>“demo challenge” </i>is not a completely open but scoped demonstration. Teams are encouraged to pick up problems within the scope of the demo challenge (elderly/health care in 2013) and to demonstrate new abilities and applications. The scope of the demo challenge changes every year.</p><h3 class="about">Finals</h3><p class="about">RoboCup@Home finishes with the finals where the 5 teams with the highest scores can perform in the scenario that has been set up. The teams are rated by a jury consisting of roboticists and non roboticists, such as people from industry, from human-machine interaction, from industrial design, from the audience and the press. The ranking of the finals determines the winner. In the finals there is less focus on technical matters, since getting in the finals already means that the teams are very good on the technical level.</p></div></div></div></div>
