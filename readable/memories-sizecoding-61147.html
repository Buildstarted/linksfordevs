<h2><span id="Disclaimer">Disclaimer</span></h2>
<p>This article discusses the submitted DosBox version (256 bytes). The available archive contains versions for FreeDos and Windows XP DOS which, at the time of this writing, don't work on all computers. These alternative versions were included as proof of concept, to show that this program does not only run on the emulator "DosBox". For the "PC 256 bytes" competition of the event "Revision" in 2020, it was allowed to specify either "FreeDos" or "DosBox" as platform, the latter with a specific configuration. It is in fact possible to modify the DosBox version to work on FreeDos, MS DOS, WinXP and Win98 as the released alternative versions showcase, but this is not the focus of this article. Anyway, safe versions for all platform and all computers are in the works. Regarding possible further optimizations, I will discuss/explain only the submitted version although i already found several spots in the code that can be optimized. As the history of tiny effects show, almost no code is perfect, and can be brought down further in size. To avoid confusion between different versions, only the submitted version will be explained.

<p>Sizecoders think in size categories. For MS DOS, these categories are 256b, 128b, 64b and 32b. These are the standards of one of the biggest demoscene archives, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pouet.net/">http://www.pouet.net</a>. There is no 16b category, although many tiny effects can be implemented in 16 bytes. Almost all of the effects of "Memories" have been coded and optimized by me before, and mostly the implementations were attempts to reduce an already existing effect in size, or do something similar in less size. Reducing the size in this case means, reducing it to the (one of the) next lower 2^N category. For example I might have seen an effect done in 33 to 64 bytes, and then reduced the size to 32 bytes or less. Almost everytime I moved an effect to a lower category, I submitted the resulting tiny program to a demoscene party which allowed remote entries in the 256b category and/or published the result to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pouet.net/">http://www.pouet.net</a> . In this section I will introduce the effects and mention the origins and authors.
</p>
<h3><span id="Array_of_chessboards">Array of chessboards</span></h3>
<div><div><p><a href="http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/File:Kasparov.gif"><img alt="" src="http://www.sizecoding.org/images/5/51/Kasparov.gif" width="400" height="250"></a></p><p>kasparov, 16 bytes</p></div></div>
<p>The origin of this effect is my own "Kasparov 16b" from 2018 (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=75912">https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=75912</a>) apparently I "had this piece lying around, stuck at 17 bytes and not that beautiful, until i found a trick&nbsp;;)" (quote from the release notes) There was a similar effect in 32 bytes before&nbsp;: "ew" by "headcrash" from 2003. (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=17567">https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=17567</a>) In this case, my design goal was to show "real" chessboards of 8x8 fields and recognizable dark and light squares, as well as the correct orientation of the single chessboards, meaning that the bottom right corner (h1) has to be a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess/Arranging_The_Board">white square</a>. For "Memories", the effect had to be reimplemented with another approach of writing to the screen to work with the framework, also the scrolling direction was changed to be different from the "scrolling tilted plane" effect.
</p>
<h3><span id="Zooming_circles">Zooming circles</span></h3>
<p>The zooming circles were supposed to be entered to a demoparty as a 32 bytes intro, but I never actually did it. There is no real predecessor in 64 bytes, because in the 64b category much more complex effects are possible. The zooming circles were the result of desperately trying to reach the 32b category for a circular "tunnel" effect, for that my own record is still 52 bytes ("Neontube" - 2016)(<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=66808">https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=66808</a>) which in turn was the optimization of the all-time-classic 64 byte effect "constant evolution" from ryg/Farbrausch (2003) (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=8697">https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=8697</a>). In the zooming circles routine, the distance and the angle are removed/ignored, so that the 32b category could be reached.
</p>
<h3><span id="Scrolling_tilted_plane">Scrolling tilted plane</span></h3>
<div><div><p><a href="http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/File:Floorcast_variation.png"><img alt="" src="http://www.sizecoding.org/images/thumb/8/83/Floorcast_variation.png/300px-Floorcast_variation.png" width="300" height="188" srcset="/images/8/83/Floorcast_variation.png 1.5x, /images/8/83/Floorcast_variation.png 2x"></a></p><div><p>Floorcast, 32 bytes version, variation</p></div></div></div>
<p>The scrolling tilted plane is one of my own releases, "floorcast 32b" from 2018. Floorcasts have its own history in sizecoding, the effect was brought down stepwise from 256 bytes to 32 bytes. The versions differ in the number of planes, some show two planes, others only one. For the "floorcast 32b" release I specifically decided against the "XOR" texture, whereas in "Memories" I used it again, but disguised with another final touch of "AND".

<p>The parallax checkerboards have been released by me as 32 bytes effect <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=76788">"Projektbeschreibung"</a> in 2018. It was the direct attempt to bring <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=28543">"Follow the light"</a> from "Digimind" (2006) or my own <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=63293">"Lucy"</a> (2014) down to 32 bytes. Very helpful inspirations came from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=32281">"Rrrolas" "Paralaxa"</a> (32 bytes, 2007) and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=61075">"Sensenstahl"s "Byteropolis"</a> (32 bytes, 2013). In fact Rrrolas rendering approach was already close to the final solution, the code was modified to correct the planes arrangement, change the shape from triangles to checkerboards and improve on the colors. In "Memories", the coloring of "Digimind"s version was used. Also, the effect has been modified to reduce shearing as much as possible.

<p>This consists of two effects, the rotozoomer and the sierpinski effect as a texture. The sierpinski effect is based on my own "Colpinski 16b" from 2013 (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=62079">https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=62079</a>) where "frag" of "fsqrt" helped pushing the limits. There is no real predecessor to that, because it is known that this effect can be done directly by combining X and Y, instead of an Iterated Function System or Cellular Automaton approach. The rotozoomer was released as 32b intro "rotastic" by me in 2017 (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=70112">https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=70112</a>), it is based on the ideas of "ryg" of "Farbrausch" (51 bytes, 2002, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=5015">https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=5015</a>) and "Gargaj" of "Conspiracy" (49 bytes, 2002, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=6088">https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=6088</a>).

<p>The raycast bent tunnel is a tweaked version of my own 64 bytes "Into a new era" release (2018, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=78044">https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=78044</a>). The custom colors were exchanged for colors of the standard palette, the geometry was tweaked a bit and changed accordingly, so that no depth effect was used for the calculation of texture values. The standalone version of this effect has a size of 50 bytes. The two main inspirations for the 64 bytes version were two 128 byte intros, "Spongy" by "TBC" (2009, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=53871">https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=53871</a>) and "Wolf128" from "Baudsurfer" (2014, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=63518">https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=63518</a>), while the particular algorithm was developed independently.

<h3><span id="Ocean_night_to_day">Ocean night to day</span></h3>
<div><div><p><a href="http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/File:Ocean.png"><img alt="" src="http://www.sizecoding.org/images/thumb/8/89/Ocean.png/300px-Ocean.png" width="300" height="188" srcset="/images/8/89/Ocean.png 1.5x, /images/8/89/Ocean.png 2x"></a></p></div></div>
<p>The ocean effect is based on my own 64 bytes release "Ocean" from 2016 (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=66857">https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=66857</a>). The custom color generation and music generation have been stripped from the original, both were not compatible with the main framework of "Memories" without consuming a LOT of extra space. The special effect of "dawn" happens as a byproduct of the general framework approach. This will be explained in the next chapter.
</p>
<h3><span id="Fading_effect">Fading effect</span></h3>
<p>The transition between two effects is an effect itself, which has no real predecessor. It is rather an idea that evolved over the years, and might have been done by many others in similar ways. In a nutshell, while calculating a frame, each pixel position is randomized and the time - which determines the effect to use - is offset by this randomization value which is downscaled before. This allows the usage of the standard VGA palette (picture, source) rather than creating custom colors for real crossfading and thus saves space.
</p>
<h2><span id="Tiny_megademo_framework">Tiny megademo framework</span></h2>
<p>The tiny megademo framework is based on ideas of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=68020">"Quatro"</a>, done by "Sensenstahl" and me. For putting many tiny effects together into a "megademo", they have all to use the same approach and they have to be mostly free of assumptions (contents of memory and registers). Also they have to use the same timing values and be tuned to a shared timing in general. Preparing the single effects to be includeable in a framework like this took quite some time and required a lot of extra space initially. It has to be noted, that - sadly - some of my most impressive effects (judged by audience reactions and views on social media) could not be included at all, because the approaches were not combineable without a HUGE overhead. Once all effects were streamlined, I could think about "factoring" out common calculations which repeatedly occur, resulting in a few saved bytes. The framework does the following:
</p>
<ul><li> Setting up screen mode to 320 x 200 pixels in 256 colors</li>
<li> Initializing a pointer to the screen</li>
<li> Installing a callback for timing and music</li>
<li> Mainloop
<ul><li> Calculation of X and Y from the current screen location
<ul><li> with the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/General_Coding_Tricks#Obtaining_X_and_Y_without_DIV_.28The_Rrrola_Trick.29">"Rrrola Trick"</a></li></ul></li>
<li> P = Pseudorandom value from screen location</li>
<li> Offset current time T by a scaled value P'</li>
<li> Selection of effect number N according to T'</li>
<li> Execution of effect N (X,Y) for current pixel
<ul><li> On entrance, XY is in register DX (DL,DH)</li>
<li> On entrance, the current time is in register BP</li>
<li> On exit, the pixel color is expected in AL</li></ul></li>
<li> Advance to next pixel</li>
<li> Triple diagonal interlacing for smoothing</li>
<li> Repeat until frame is complete</li></ul></li>
<li> Set timer to a tempo of ~35 FPS</li>
<li> Check keyboard for ESC
<ul><li> Quit on ESC, otherwise continue</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>The most simple effect and a good one to start with. After offsetting the row by the time, the classic XOR pattern is applied. To achieve the impression of a grid of chessboards, all bits but two are set in the color. The real trick lies in shifting to a "good" palette spot. The portion of the frame which is perceived as black, isn't actually black, it's the dark part of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array#Color_palette">standard VGA palette</a>. Shifting that way also makes the dark and light square look like they are from an ancient old chessboard.

<p>The distance D of a point (X,Y) to the center (0,0) is sqrt(X²+Y²). The framework already makes sure the DL contains a centered X coordinate, DH=Y has to be centered though. Performing a square root on x86 requires quite a bit of code, but this actually can be omitted. With a clever selection of colors, the impression of zooming circles without square root is quite decent.

<p>This effect is achieved as follow. First, a large constant is divided by the row number Y, to simulate distance. Then the resulting value is used twice, a) scaled by a centered X value and b) offset by current time. These results are then combined with the XOR pattern of which a special pattern is selected.

<p>This is kind of raycasting with dynamic geometry. Each object plane is split horizontally because of the signed 16 bit multiplication and vertically because of an implicit logic column number operation. Additionally, implicit shearing is applied, so that the edges of the resulting grid (4 "solid" patches, 4 "transparent" patches, alternating) connect. If the ray hits one of the solid patches, the color becomes the iteration number (+palette offset into grayscale), if not, the plane is shifted by the screenpointer and the process is repeated until the maximum iteration number is reached.

<p>Rotozooming normally requires trigonometric functions, or good estimations of them. Let's look at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#In_two_dimensions">usual 2D rotation equation</a> and interpret it in a special way to get rid of the trigonometry in the calculation:
</p>
<div dir="ltr"><pre><span>x</span><span>'</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>y</span><span>*</span><span>si</span><span>n</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span><span>'</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>si</span><span>n</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>*</span><span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If we add zooming to it, it looks like this:
</p>
<div dir="ltr"><pre><span>x</span><span>'</span> <span>=</span> <span>z</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>y</span><span>*</span><span>si</span><span>n</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span>
<span>y</span><span>'</span> <span>=</span> <span>z</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>si</span><span>n</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>*</span><span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now let's assume, we don't specify z ourself, and factor out cos(a):
</p>
<div dir="ltr"><pre><span>x</span><span>'</span> <span>=</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>y</span><span>*</span><span>tan</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>))</span>
<span>y</span><span>'</span> <span>=</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>tan</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Finally, let's substitute tan(a) with our time variable, since the tangens function rises to infinity the closer we get to +-90°:
</p>
<div dir="ltr"><pre><span>x</span><span>'</span> <span>=</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>atan</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>))</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>y</span><span>*</span><span>T</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span><span>'</span> <span>=</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>atan</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>))</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>T</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As long as we don't care about specifying the zoomfactor and don't directly control the angle, we can now rotate between -90° and +90° without using trigonometric functions. As a byproduct, the zoomfactor is now tied to the time T. The function for the zoomfactor is shown in the image, it results in zooming from infinitely small to one (original) and back to infinitely small. Quite a few bytes have been spent to beautify the effect, correct the timing offset, speeding up the animation, enlarging the sierpinski pixels and have decent colors, but I thought it's worth the space.

<p>The ocean effect is a wonderful example for a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross#Style">"happy accident"</a>. If you load a value into the FPU as integer, and store it as floating point value, and interpret it as integer again, you get a cool pattern. Combine that with a reverse divide and you get a neat wavy effect. This works in tight conjunction with the register DX, which has a sign flip at the position we want, so we can easily separate sky and sea. The final touch is the coloring though. By design of the global framework, the value of AL is determined on function entrance, it contains the effect adress. With a bit of code shuffling, the color of the sky came "for free", without using instructions, as well as the "fading to day"-color, which is also an effect adress. And that is no happy accident. In other versions than the original submitted DosBox version, the sky color can vary for that reason.

<h2><span id="MIDI_music_part">MIDI music part</span></h2>
<p>This code section increments the timing value and produces sound. By chosing channel 3 we can reuse the "change channel instrument" instruction again as "RET". By shifting around the code of the effects, a reasonable value for the volume could be created and thus save another byte. Be aware that this code sequence only works if the MIDI device is already in UART mode, otherwise three more bytes have to be spent. Quite a few people from the audience and sceners told my afterwards that the melody sounds a bit like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incantations_(album)">Incantations from Mike Oldfield</a>, but it is rather created by a simple approach. Starting with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=65604">"Hypnoteye" in 2015</a>, I experimented with procedural MIDI and eventually released a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=66313">small MIDI framework (64 bytes)</a>. The basic principle is to jump through tonal space with fixed steps, and map high values back to lower ones (by modulo). With simple combinations of stepwidth and modvalue, interesting effects can be produced. For example stepwidth=3 for reduced minor chords which are never resolved, likewise stepwidth=4, or stepwidth=6 for tritonal effects. With a well chosen modvalue, these patterns can create progressions. I did not do an appropriate theoretical analysis yet, rather explored the tonal space and noted when something sounded interesting.
