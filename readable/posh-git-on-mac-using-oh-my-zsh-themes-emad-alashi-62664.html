			<p>This post explains how to have posh-git prompt style in Oh My Zsh theme on Mac.</p>
<p>After 4 years of using Windows, I am coming back to using a Mac. And there are <a href="https://twitter.com/EmadAshi/status/1183642418765168640?s=20">so many things</a> in Windows I am missing already. One of these things is <a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git">posh-git</a>; I loved how in one glance to your prompt you know the status of your git repo: how many files changed, how many added, how many deleted, how many indexedâ€¦ just love it!</p>
<p>Once I moved to Mac, I changed my shell to use zsh using <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">Oh My Zsh</a> due to the rich experience it brings to the terminal. I was delighted to see all these <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/themes">themes</a> and plugins, and then started looking for a theme that provided the same information posh-git prompt provided. To my surprise, there was none! So I started my quest to see how I can change zsh, the theme, or the plugin to have such prompt.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.emadashi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PromptDefaultLong.png" alt="A posh-git prompt that shows the number of files index and changed." width="418" height="22" srcset="https://www.emadashi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PromptDefaultLong.png 418w, https://www.emadashi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PromptDefaultLong-300x16.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px"></p>
<p>Being lazy, I wanted change an existing theme I like with the least amount of investment. I looked in the documentation to see how I could do that, and found the <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization">customisation wiki page</a>:</p>
<h2>Should I override the theme?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-and-adding-themes">Overriding the theme</a> seemed to be the perfect solution, however, there were couple of drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you override a theme, you override the theme, period! This means that if the author changes something after you have overridden it, you will not get these new changes.</li>
<li>It was a little bit too much for me to grasp! When I looked at <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/avit.zsh-theme">avit theme</a> as an example, I had questions like what is PROMPT and PROMPT2? What are all these special characters? Where is the reference/documentation to all of these? Are they theme-specific, or are they part of zsh theme reference?</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember I wanted to put the least amount of effort, and I surely didnâ€™t want to learn the whole thing! But while looking into avit theme, one thing grasped my attention: there was a clear reference to what seemed to be like a function <em><strong>git_prompt_info</strong></em>. And I thought this should be it, if I could find where this function is and how to override it.</p>
<p>To my luck, it was <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-internals">mentioned</a> as an example in the customisation wiki page as an example!</p>
<h2>Override the internals it is!</h2>
<p>Ok great, now I know that I can customise <strong><em>git_prompt_info</em></strong>, all what I need is to mimic whatever posh-git does in that function!</p>
<p>So I hit <del>google</del> duckduckgo again on the hope that someone already did this, and oh my! I found that <a href="https://github.com/lyze/posh-git-sh/">there is already</a> a port of it on bash. Thatâ€™s great, now what should I do? Replace the call of <strong><em>prompt_git_info</em></strong> in the theme with a call to <strong><em>__posh_git_ps1</em></strong>? Or should I call it from <em><strong>prompt_git_info</strong></em>? Since <em><strong>prompt_git_info</strong></em> is an internal lib function, it is probably used in many themes, thus it will make sense to just call <em><strong>__posh_git_pst</strong></em> from within. And to my good surprise, there is a <a href="https://github.com/lyze/posh-git-sh/issues/14">GitHub issue</a> in the posh-git-bash repo that discusses integrating with zsh, itâ€™s even referenced in the main README.md file of the repo.</p>
<p>Initially I mistakenly called the <em><strong>__posh_git_ps1</strong></em> function, but I soon realised that I need to print (echo) the git info just like <em><strong>prompt_git_info</strong></em> did rather than changing any variables, for that I should use the <em><strong>__posh_git_echo</strong></em>.</p>
<p>And thus I ended up with a file called <em><strong>emad-git-prompt.zsh</strong></em> under the path <strong><em>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom</em></strong> with the content of posh-git-bash <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyze/posh-git-sh/master/git-prompt.sh">here</a>, and at the end of the file I wrote the following code:</p>
<div><div id="highlighter_408490"><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p></td><td><div><p><code>git_prompt_info () {</code></p><p><code>__posh_git_echo</code></p><p><code>}</code></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
<p>I hope this helps you ðŸ™‚</p>
