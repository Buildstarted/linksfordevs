  <p>Last week, a global consortium of scientists officially launched the <a href="https://www.earthbiogenome.org/" target="_blank">Earth BioGenome Project</a>. As Kate Kelland at <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-science-biogenome/scientists-launch-plan-to-map-genes-of-all-complex-life-on-earth-idUSKCN1N64XW" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reports, the backers are calling the extensive initiative the next “moonshot for biology.” Projected to cost $4.7 billion, it aims to sequence the DNA of the 1.5 million known species of eukaryotic, or complex species of life on Earth. Having a DNA map of so many species, researchers say, will reframe what we know about biology, ecology and biodiversity.</p>




  

    

    
      
        
          
        
      
    
  

  <p>According to <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/international-consortium-officially-launches-earth-biogenome-project-london" target="_blank">a press release</a>, the project is kicking off with a new effort by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, called the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/news/view/genetic-code-66000-uk-species-be-sequenced" target="_blank">Darwin Tree of Life Project</a>, which aims to sequence all 66,000 eukaryotic species found in Great Britain over the next ten years. In total, 17 institutions across the globe, including the <a href="https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/smithsonian-scientists-partner-global-alliance-sequence-dna-all-complex-life-earth" target="_blank">Smithsonian</a>, have signed on for the project and will outline their plans in the near future.</p>




  

  <p>Currently, scientists have only sequenced the genomes of about 3,500 species of complex life and only about 100 have been sequenced at “reference quality” which is used for in-depth research. Adding tens of thousands of genomes to that list is nothing short of revolutionary.</p>




  

  <p>“We’re talking about new medicines, new fuels for the future,” Julia Wilson of the Sanger Trust tells Victoria Gill at the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46046494" target="_blank">BBC</a>. “We’re limited at the moment by our imaginations—we can't even imagine what this would tell us.”</p>




  

  <p>The ambitious idea first came together in 2015 at a <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-04-earth-biogenome-aims-sequence-dna.html" target="_blank">meeting</a> spearheaded by Harry A. Lewin, University of California, Davis distinguished professor of evolution and ecology; Gene Robinson, director of the Carl R. Woese University of Illinois’ Institute for Genomic Biology; and W. John Kress, research botanist and curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.</p>




  

  <p>The researchers were inspired by the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/12011238/an-overview-of-the-human-genome-project/" target="_blank">Human Genome Project</a>. While the historic sequencing of the human genome in 2003 had taken over a decade to do and cost roughly $3 billion at the time (which, if you take inflation into account, would cost an estimated $5 billion t0day), the massive effort dramatically reduced the cost of sequencing services. That puts this massive project within the realm of possibility.</p>




  

  <p>When completed, it’s believed the Earth BioGenome Project will produce an exabyte of data, or 1 billion gigabytes, which will be shared online for free.</p>




  

  <p>It’s hard to say what the gene mapping will lead to. “The gaps in our knowledge are a lot bigger than what we know,” Lewin tells the BBC. “So we're not even filling in the pieces of the puzzle; most of the puzzle is empty.”</p>




  

  <p>But as Jim Smith, director of science at the Wellcome Trust, points out the same was true when researchers first got to work on the Human Genome Project a quarter century ago. “[W]e could not imagine how the DNA sequence produced back then would transform research into human health and disease today,” says Smith. “Embarking on a mission to sequence all life on Earth is no different.”</p>
