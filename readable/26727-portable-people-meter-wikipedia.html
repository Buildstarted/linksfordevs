The PPM is worn like a <a href="/wiki/Pager" title="Pager">pager</a>, and detects hidden audio tones within a station or network's audio stream, logging each time it finds such a signal. 
</p><p>Although the makers of the PPM claim that it is more accurate than traditional alternatives like handwritten logs or wired meters, critics have raised issues about its accuracy. Another sales argument is that the device is immune to human forgetfulness, something that can be an issue in studies that rely on self-reporting by test subjects.
</p><p>There are several parts to the PPM system:
</p><p>The original PPM concept required the base station to be connected to a telephone line to transmit panelists' listening data from the PPM to the collection point.  The PPM 360, introduced in 2010, uses <a href="/wiki/Mobile_phone" title="Mobile phone">cellular telephone</a> technology to accomplish this without the need for a wired telephone service.  They also have a motion sensor to detect when the PPM is being worn by an active person: After a period of 30 minutes of no activity, they go into a low-power "sleep" mode to conserve battery life.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Portable_People_Meter&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: History">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2><p>The original concept for the PPM can be traced to a brainstorming session at Arbitron in November 1988.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2010)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>  Concerns over the forthcoming move from analog video to high-definition digital television had engineers concerned that the technology then in use would become obsolete overnight. Drawing upon his experience in testing laboratories, Dr. Gerald Cohen proposed embedding an identifying signal in the audio and later decoding it. The rationale was simple. Dr. Cohen argued that audio was less likely to undergo as drastic a change in content and technology as would video, hence any technology developed would not likely to become obsolete in a few years.
</p><p>The concept was presented to the company at that time and was also written up in a short concept document. A preliminary investigation was undertaken, but the technology was never given serious consideration. The concept was written off and forgotten as Arbitron had larger issues in its competition with the Nielsen Company for television ratings. Arbitron lost that battle and went back to its core business&nbsp;— radio ratings.
</p><p>Dr. Cohen's idea lay dormant until 1992 when Drs. Richard Schlunt and Patrick Nunally approached Arbitron. Meeting with Ronald Kolessar, Director of Technology, Dr. Cohen and others, they presented a new variation of the idea&nbsp;— selectively embed a code into the frequency spectrum of the baseband audio stream and use digital signal processing in a small wearable device to recover the embedded code buried in what a person watches or hears.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2010)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup></p><p>Convinced that that concept could be achieved, Mr. Kolessar obtained denial from Arbitron's management to undertake a fast-track effort to determine feasibility. Lacking the internal expertise to do so, additional outside help from <a href="/wiki/Martin_Marietta" title="Martin Marietta">Martin Marietta</a> was sought. Facing cutbacks in the defense industry, Martin Marietta agreed to take on commercial business even to the point of signing away all rights to the technology they were to develop. Engineers at Martin Marietta decided that the best approach was to employ the principle of <a href="/wiki/Psychoacoustics" title="Psychoacoustics">psychoacoustics</a> to mask the embedded code signal, an approach described in <span><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="//www.google.com/patents/US5450490">U.S. Patent 5,450,490</a></span>.
</p><p>Now a full-fledged project having management support, development by engineers at Arbitron focused on improving the encoding and detection methodology and miniaturization into a hand-held device. Additional capabilities such as motion detection were added later on.
</p><p>In 2008, EE Times, as part of their <i>Great Minds, Great Ideas</i> project, profiled Mr. Kolessar as the "Inventor of the Portable People Meter".<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p><p>The PPM is an electronic measurement system that delivers empirical, verifiable audience measurement data. These results are sometimes at odds with the results generated with the diary method in which listeners were asked to note each change of their radio dial.
