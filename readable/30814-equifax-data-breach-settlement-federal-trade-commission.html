These companies collect information about your credit history, such as how many credit cards you have, how much money you owe, and how you pay your bills. Each company creates a credit report about you, and then sells this report to businesses who are deciding whether to give you credit. You cannot opt out of this data collection. However, you can <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports">review your credit report </a>for free and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs">freeze your credit</a>.</p><h3>4. I’m not sure I was affected by the data breach. How can I find out?</h3><p>Use this <a href="https://eligibility.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/en/eligibility">look-up tool</a> to see if you were affected by the breach.</p><p><span><strong><span>For more information, visit</span></strong><a href="https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/"><span><span>www.EquifaxBreachSettlement.com</span></span></a><span><strong>or call 1-833-759-2982.</strong></span></span></p></div></div></div></div>
