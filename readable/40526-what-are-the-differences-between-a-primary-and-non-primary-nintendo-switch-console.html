<p>The first time you use your Nintendo Account to connect to the Nintendo Switch eShop, the Nintendo Switch console you use will be activated as the primary console for your Nintendo Account. After you have designated your Nintendo Account&apos;s primary console you can still link that account to other Nintendo Switch consoles, but these consoles will not be activated as primary consoles.</p> <p>When using the primary console, any user on that device can play downloadable content you have purchased. You are also not required to connect online prior to using downloadable content on your primary console (an Internet connection is required to use online features or games which require a subscription service).</p> <p>If you deactivate your primary console, the next time you use your Nintendo Account to connect to Nintendo eShop on a Nintendo Switch console, that console will become your Nintendo Account&apos;s primary console.</p>
<p>To verify whether a console is the primary console for your Nintendo Account, check the <strong>Primary Console Status</strong> in your <a href="/app/answers/detail/a_id/22318" class="popup">Nintendo eShop Account Information</a>.</p>
