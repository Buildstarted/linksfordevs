Authorisation is required for all APIs that enable searching HIBP by email address, namely
<a href="#BreachesForAccount">retrieving all breaches for an account</a> and
<a href="#PastesForAccount">retrieving all pastes for an account</a>. An HIBP subscription
key is required to make an authorised call and can be obtained on <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key">the API key page</a>.
The key is then passed in a "hibp-api-key" header:
</p>
<p><code>GET https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/{service}/{parameter}
hibp-api-key: [your key]</code></p><p>Semantic HTTP response codes are used to indicate the result of the API call:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Code</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>401</td>
<td>Unauthorised â€” the API key provided was not valid</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr>
<h3 id="APIVersion">Specifying the API version</h3>
<p>
Version 3 of the API is consumable only by specifying the API version in the URL. In version
2, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/your-api-versioning-is-wrong-which-is/">multiple different API versioning schemes were supported</a>
however the overwhelming majority of implementations chose versioning via the URL.
Consequently, previous alternative versioning schemes have been discontinued for the APIs
that retrieve breach or paste data via email address and require authorisation. Non-auth'd
APIs such as retrieving a list of all previous breaches still support multiple versioning
schemes so as not to break existing dependencies.
</p>
<h4>Versioning via the URL</h4>
<p>
This method can easily be invoked directly by requesting the URL with <a href="#UserAgent">an appropriate user agent string</a>.
</p>
<p><code>GET https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/{service}/{parameter}</code></p><hr>
<h3 id="UserAgent">Specifying the user agent</h3>
<p>
Each request to the API must be accompanied by a user agent request header. Typically this
should be the name of the app consuming the service. A missing user agent will result in an
HTTP 403 response. A valid request would look like:
</p>
<p><code>GET https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/{service}/{parameter}
user-agent: [your app name]</code></p><p>
The user agent should accurately describe the nature of the API consumer such that it can be
clearly identified in the request. Not doing so may result in the request being blocked.
</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="BreachesForAccount">Getting all breaches for an account</h3>
<p>
The most common use of the API is to return a list of all breaches a particular account has
been involved in. The API takes a single parameter which is the account to be searched for.
The account is not case sensitive and will be trimmed of leading or trailing white spaces.
The account should always be URL encoded. This is an authenticated API and <a href="#Authorisation">an HIBP API key</a>
must be passed with the request.
</p>
<p><code>GET https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breachedaccount/{account}
hibp-api-key: [your key]</code></p><p>
By default, only the name of the breach is returned rather than the complete breach data,
thus reducing the response body size by approximately 98%. The name can then be used to
either <a href="#SingleBreach">retrieve a single breach</a> or it can be found in
<a href="#AllBreaches">the list of all breaches in the system</a>. If you'd like complete
breach data returned in the API call, a non-truncated response can be specified via query
string parameter:
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Parameter</td>
<td>Example</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>truncateResponse</td>
<td>?truncateResponse=false</td>
<td>
Returns <a href="#BreachModel">the full breach model</a>.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Note: In version 2 of the API this behaviour was the opposite - responses were not truncated
by default.
</p>
<p>
The result set can also be filtered by passing one of the following query strings:
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Parameter</td>
<td>Example</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>domain</td>
<td>?domain=adobe.com</td>
<td>
Filters the result set to only breaches against the domain specified. It is possible
that one site (and consequently domain), is compromised on multiple occasions.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Note: the public API <em>will not</em> return accounts from any breaches flagged as <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs#SensitiveBreach">sensitive</a>
or <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs#RetiredBreach">retired</a>. By default, the API will return breaches
flagged as <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs#UnverifiedBreach">unverified</a>, however these can be excluded by
using the following parameter:
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Parameter</td>
<td>Example</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>includeUnverified</td>
<td>?includeUnverified=false</td>
<td>
Returns breaches that have been flagged as "unverified". By default, both
verified and unverified breaches are returned when performing a search.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Note: In version 2 of the API this behaviour was the opposite - unverified breaches were not
returned by default.
</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="AllBreaches">Getting all breached sites in the system</h3>
<p>
A "breach" is an instance of a system having been compromised by an attacker and
the data disclosed. For example, Adobe was a breach, Gawker was a breach etc. It is possible
to return the details of each of breach in the system which currently stands at <strong>428 breaches</strong>.
</p>
<p>By version in URL (testable <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breaches">by clicking here</a>):</p>
<p><code>GET https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breaches</code></p><p>
The result set can also be filtered by passing one of the following query strings:
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Parameter</td>
<td>Example</td>
<td>Test</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>domain</td>
<td>?domain=adobe.com</td>
<td><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breaches?domain=adobe.com">test</a></td>
<td>
Filters the result set to only breaches against the domain specified. It is possible
that one site (and consequently domain), is compromised on multiple occasions.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr>
<h3 id="SingleBreach">Getting a single breached site</h3>
<p>
Sometimes just a single breach is required and this can be retrieved by the breach
"name". This is the stable value which may or may not be the same as the breach
"title" (which can change). See <a href="#BreachModel">the breach model</a> below
for more info.
</p>
<p>By version in URL (testable <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breach/Adobe">by clicking here</a>):</p>
<p><code>GET https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breach/{name}</code></p><hr>
<h3 id="AllDataClasses">Getting all data classes in the system</h3>
<p>
A "data class" is an attribute of a record compromised in a breach. For example,
many breaches expose data classes such as "Email addresses" and
"Passwords". The values returned by this service are ordered alphabetically in a
string array and will expand over time as new breaches expose previously unseen classes of
data.

<p><code>GET https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/dataclasses</code></p><hr>
<h3 id="BreachModel">The breach model</h3>
<p>
Each breach contains a number of attributes describing the incident. In the future, these
attributes may expand <em>without</em> the API being versioned. The current attributes are:
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Attribute</td>
<td>Type</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>string</td>
<td>
A Pascal-cased name representing the breach which is unique across all other breaches.
This value never changes and may be used to name dependent assets (such as images) but
should not be shown directly to end users (see the "Title" attribute instead).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Title</td>
<td>string</td>
<td>
A descriptive title for the breach suitable for displaying to end users. It's unique
across all breaches but individual values may change in the future (i.e. if another
breach occurs against an organisation already in the system). If a stable value is
required to reference the breach, refer to the "Name" attribute instead.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Domain</td>
<td>string</td>
<td>
The domain of the primary website the breach occurred on. This may be used for
identifying other assets external systems may have for the site.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BreachDate</td>
<td>date</td>
<td>
The date (with no time) the breach originally occurred on in ISO 8601 format. This is
not always accurate â€” frequently breaches are discovered and reported long after
the original incident. Use this attribute as a guide only.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AddedDate</td>
<td>datetime</td>
<td>
The date and time (precision to the minute) the breach was added to the system in ISO
8601 format.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ModifiedDate</td>
<td>datetime</td>
<td>
The date and time (precision to the minute) the breach was <em>modified</em> in ISO
8601 format. This will only differ from the AddedDate attribute if other attributes
represented here are changed or data in the breach itself is changed (i.e. additional
data is identified and loaded). It is always either equal to or greater then the
AddedDate attribute, never less than.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PwnCount</td>
<td>integer</td>
<td>
The total number of accounts loaded into the system. This is usually less than the
total number reported by the media due to duplication or other data integrity issues in
the source data.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Description</td>
<td>string</td>
<td>
Contains an overview of the breach represented in HTML markup. The description may
include markup such as emphasis and strong tags as well as hyperlinks.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DataClasses</td>
<td>string[]</td>
<td>
This attribute describes the nature of the data compromised in the breach and contains
an alphabetically ordered string array of impacted data classes.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IsVerified</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>
Indicates that the breach is considered <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs#UnverifiedBreach">unverified</a>.
An unverified breach <em>may not</em> have been hacked from the indicated website. An
unverified breach is still loaded into HIBP when there's sufficient confidence that a
significant portion of the data is legitimate.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IsFabricated</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>
Indicates that the breach is considered <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs#FabricatedBreach">fabricated</a>.
A fabricated breach is <em>unlikely</em> to have been hacked from the indicated
website and usually contains a large amount of manufactured data. However, it still
contains legitimate email addresses and asserts that the account owners were
compromised in the alleged breach.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IsSensitive</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>
Indicates if the breach is considered <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs#SensitiveBreach">sensitive</a>.
The public API <em>will not</em> return any accounts for a breach flagged as sensitive.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IsRetired</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>
Indicates if the breach has been <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs#RetiredBreach">retired</a>. This data
has been permanently removed and will not be returned by the API.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IsSpamList</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>
Indicates if the breach is considered a <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs#SpamList">spam list</a>. This
flag has no impact on any other attributes but it means that the data has not come as a
result of a security compromise.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LogoPath</td>
<td>string</td>
<td>
A URI that specifies where a logo for the breached service can be found. Logos are
always in PNG format.
</td>
</tr>

<h3 id="PwnedPasswords">Pwned Passwords overview</h3>
<p>
Pwned Passwords are more than half a billion passwords which have previously been exposed in
data breaches. The service is detailed in <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/">the launch blog post</a>
then <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2">further
expanded on with the release of version 2</a>. The entire data set is <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">both
downloadable and searchable online via the Pwned Passwords page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Each password is stored as a SHA-1 hash of a UTF-8 encoded password. The downloadable source
data delimits the full SHA-1 hash and the password count with a colon (:) and each line with a
CRLF.
</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="SearchingPwnedPasswordsByRange">Searching by range</h3>
<p>
In order to protect the value of the source password being searched for, Pwned Passwords also
implements a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity">k-Anonymity model</a> that
allows a password to be searched for by partial hash. This allows the first 5 characters of a
SHA-1 password hash (not case-sensitive) to be passed to the API (testable
<a href="https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/21BD1">by clicking here</a>):
</p>
<p><code>GET https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{first 5 hash chars}</code></p><p>
When a password hash with the same first 5 characters is found in the Pwned Passwords
repository, the API will respond with an HTTP 200 and include the <em>suffix</em> of every
hash beginning with the specified prefix, followed by a count of how many times it appears in
the data set. The API consumer can then search the results of the response for the presence
of their source hash and if not found, the password does not exist in the data set. A sample
response for the hash prefix "21BD1" would be as follows:
</p>
<p><code>0018A45C4D1DEF81644B54AB7F969B88D65:1
00D4F6E8FA6EECAD2A3AA415EEC418D38EC:2
011053FD0102E94D6AE2F8B83D76FAF94F6:1

0136E006E24E7D152139815FB0FC6A50B15:2
...</code></p><p>
A range search typically returns approximately 500 hash suffixes, although this number will
differ depending on the hash prefix being searched for and will increase as more passwords
are added. There are 1,048,576 different hash prefixes between 00000 and FFFFF (16^5) and
every single one will return HTTP 200; there is no circumstance in which the API should
return HTTP 404.

<hr>
<h3 id="HTTPS">HTTPS</h3>
<p>
All API endpoints must be invoked over HTTPS. Any requests over HTTP will result in a 301
response with a redirect to the same path on the secure scheme. Only TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3
are supported; older versions of the protocol will not allow a connection to be made.
</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="CORS">Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">CORS</a> is only
supported for non-authenticated APIs. When supported, it accepts all origins â€” you can
hit the API from websites on any other domain.
</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="RateLimiting">Rate limiting</h3>
<p>
Requests to the breaches and pastes APIs are limited to one per every 1500
milliseconds each from any given HIBP API key (a key may request both APIs within this
period). Any request that exceeds the limit will receive an <a href="https://httpstatuses.com/429">HTTP 429 "Too many requests"</a>
response. The response also includes an accompanying "retry-after" response header
expressing the number of seconds remaining before the IP address can make a successful API
call (the value is rounded up to the next whole second). The response body explains the rate limit and refers to the <a href="#AcceptableUse">acceptable use</a>
documentation.
</p>
<p>
A typical response looks like this:
</p>
<p><code>HTTP/1.1 429
retry-after: 2
{ "statusCode": 429, "message": "Rate limit is exceeded. Try again in 2 seconds." }</code></p><p>
The retry period is sliding; attempting to query the API more aggressively than the rate
allows causes the retry period to start again with each failed request. It's advisable to
avoid querying the API at exactly the rate limit as network behaviour may result in some
requests arriving within the retry period and causing a 429. Adding an additional 100
millisecond delay between requests on top of the rate limit will usually ensure this won't
happen.
</p>

Where the rate limit is consistently exceeded, further defences may be employed to limit the
ability to query the API. These defences include blocks or JavaScript challenges by
Cloudflare which may result in an HTTP 503 "Service Unavailable" response.

There is no rate limit on the Pwned Passwords API.

There's not much point; if you want to build up a treasure trove of pwned email addresses or
usernames, go and download the dumps (they're usually just a Google search away) and save
yourself the hassle and time of trying to enumerate an API one account at a time. That said,
use of the API should fall within acceptable use expectations:
</p>

<h3 id="AcceptableUse">Acceptable use</h3>
<p>
The API has been designed to make it easy for people to do <em>awesome</em> things with it.
Things that are <em>not</em> awesome include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Querying the data for purposes that are intended to cause harm to the victims of data breaches</li>
<li>Anything deliberately intended to limit service availability such as denial of service attacks</li>
<li>Deliberate attempts to circumvent measures designed to ensure acceptable use</li>
<li>Not <a href="#UserAgent">properly identifying the user agent</a> such that it accurately describes the consumer of the API</li>
<li>Misrepresenting the consuming client by impersonating other user agents in an attempt to obfuscate API requests</li>
<li>Other services designed to fraudulently represent the Have I Been Pwned name or brand</li>
<li>Misrepresenting the source of the data as originating from somewhere other than Have I Been Pwned</li>
<li>Not adhering to the Creative Commons Attribution License <a href="#AcceptableUse">as described below</a></li>
<li>Automating the consumption of other APIs not explicitly documented on this page</li>
<li>Using the service in a fashion that brings Have I Been Pwned into disrepute</li>
</ul>
<p>
Abusing these objectives may limit your ability to query the service via a range of
countermeasures. Those countermeasures may impact other consumers of the API if they share
network services with an abusive user. If in doubt, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/contact/">get in touch</a>
and outline how you'd like to use the service in a way that's consistent with these
objectives.

In other words, you're welcome to use the public API to build other services, but <em>you must
identify Have I Been Pwned as the source of the data </em>. Clear and visible attribution
with a link to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> should be present
anywhere data from the service is used including when searching breaches or pastes and when
representing breach descriptions. It doesn't have to be overt, but the interface in which
Have I Been Pwned data is represented should clearly attribute the source per the
<a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.
</p>
<p>
In order to help maximise adoption, there is no licencing or attribution requirements on the
Pwned Passwords API, although it is welcomed if you would like to include it.
