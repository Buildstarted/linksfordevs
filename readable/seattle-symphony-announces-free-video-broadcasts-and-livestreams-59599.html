    <p>Seattle Symphony musicians share performances to offer strength, comfort and unity through music while Benaroya Hall is closed through March 31 to limit the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
 
<p>In accordance with <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-issues-emergency-proclamation-limits-large-events-minimize-public-health-risk" target="_blank">the latest mandate</a> from Washington Governor Jay Inslee, Benaroya Hall <a href="https://www.seattlesymphony.org/planyourvisit/virus">announced yesterday</a> that all public events have been canceled through March 31, 2020 in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
 
<p>As our community confronts a current global health crisis, the Seattle Symphony will continue sharing performances that provide strength, comfort and joy through video rebroadcasts and livestreams throughout the month.</p>
 
<p>The first rebroadcast will be the live performance of Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 led by Music Director Thomas Dausgaard on Thursday, March 12, 2020, at 7:30 p.m. PDT and Saturday, March 14, 2020, at 8 p.m. PDT on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/seattlesymphony" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/seattlesymphony" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. This concert was originally performed on September 19, 2019.</p>

<p>The Seattle Symphony is organizing additional free livestreams and rebroadcasts until the orchestra can return to the Benaroya Hall stage. More details will be shared in the coming days at <a href="https://seattlesymphony.org/live">seattlesymphony.org/live</a>.</p>
 
<p>Alexander White, Associate Principal Trumpet and Chairperson of the Seattle Symphony and Opera Players’ Organization says, “As musicians, we unite in good times and bad to make music as a community, for our community. So, to our friends in Seattle and our friends around the world, here is our gift to you in the language we know best: music.”</p>
 
<p>“I believe music has the power to transform lives and bring people together in new and surprising ways,” shares Music Director Thomas Dausgaard. “Even though we can’t gather at Benaroya Hall, I’m so happy we’ll still be sharing musical moments together, whether you’re at home in Seattle or halfway across the world.”</p>
 
<p>“From the <a href="https://www.seattlesymphony.org/the7">Music Beyond Borders</a> concert presented in response to the January 2017 travel ban, to providing <a href="https://www.seattlesymphony.org/watch-listen/beyondthestage/federal-employees">free tickets to furloughed federal employees</a>, to performing concerts in memory of <a href="https://www.seattlesymphony.org/watch-listen/beyondthestage/concert-dedication">hate crime victims</a>, the Seattle Symphony has been here through many of our world’s most significant moments,” comments President &amp; CEO Krishna Thiagarajan. “It’s part of who we are and what we believe music can provide for our community.”</p>

<p>Inspired by the orchestra’s dedication to serving the community, Seattle Symphony Board Member Stephen Whyte has generously pledged to match gifts, dollar-for-dollar throughout Benaroya Hall’s closure.</p>

<p>“As a nonprofit organization, the cancellation of concerts will have a significant financial impact on the Symphony due to unrecoverable losses in ticket sales,” shares René Ancinas, Board Chair of the Seattle Symphony. “And even amidst uncertain times, it’s inspiring to see our orchestra unleash the power of music, bring us together and lift our spirits.”</p>
 
<p><strong>Your support today is more important than ever.</strong> As a nonprofit arts organization, the Seattle Symphony relies on support from the community. Please consider the role music plays in your life and support your Symphony with a gift of any amount today.</p>
