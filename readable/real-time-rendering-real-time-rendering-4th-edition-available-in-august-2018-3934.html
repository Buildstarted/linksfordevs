<p>As announced today at the Games Developers Conference by&nbsp;CRC Press / Taylor &amp; Francis Group (booth 2104, South Hall ‚Äì I‚Äôm told there‚Äôs a discount code to be had), we‚Äôre indeed finally putting out a new edition of <em>Real-Time Rendering</em>. It should be out by SIGGRAPH <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias">if all goes well</a>. Tomas, Naty, and I have been working on this edition since August 2016. We realized that, given the amount that‚Äôs changed in area lighting, global illumination, and volume rendering, that we could use help, so asked Angelo Pesce,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miwanicki/">Micha≈Ç Iwanicki</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastienhillaire/">S√©bastien Hillaire</a> to join us, which they all kindly and eagerly did. Their contributions both considerably improved the book and got it done.</p>
<p>If you want me to just shut up and tell you where to pre-order, <strong><a href="https://bit.ly/buyrtr4">go here</a></strong>. You‚Äôll note the lack of cover, and lack of the new three authors. Those‚Äôll get fixed once there‚Äôs a more official launch, and official pricing. I suspect the price won‚Äôt go down (which is a hint, and you can cancel later if I‚Äôm wrong; which reminds me, you should also <a href="https://t.co/W4Hn9kc2En">book a room now for SIGGRAPH</a> if you have the slightest chance of going, since you can also cancel up until July 22 without penalty).</p>
<p>One reason for no cover is that we‚Äôre still evaluating them. At the GDC booth you‚Äôll see this artwork used:</p>

<p>This is a lovely, colorful model by <a href="https://sketchfab.com/elqui">Elinor Quittner</a>. You can see the interactive model <a href="https://skfb.ly/6tpNY">here</a>, and definitely check out the Model Inspector feature on that page by clicking the ‚ÄúI‚Äù key (or the ‚Äúlayers‚Äù looking icon in the lower right) once the model‚Äôs loaded. I love this feature in Sketchfab, that you can examine the various elements. All that said, we‚Äôre still examining a number of other cover possibilities. Me, I‚Äôm happy we get to show&nbsp;off this potential design&nbsp;here now.</p>
<p>Back to the book itself. Let‚Äôs look at page count:</p>
<ul>
<li>First edition, published 1999, 482 pages</li>
<li>Second edition, published 2002, 864 pages</li>
<li>Third edition, published 2008, 1045 pages</li>
<li>Fourth edition, to be published 2018, 1269? pages (1356?, including online)</li>
</ul>
<p>This new edition is probably a worst-kept secret, in that anyone searching ‚ÄúReal-Time Rendering, 4th edition‚Äù on Amazon would have found the entry months ago, and <a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Real-Time-Rendering-Fourth-Edition/Akenine-Moller-Haines-Hoffman/p/book/9781138627000">CRC put it on their site</a> some time <a href="https://twitter.com/SebLagarde/status/972783009920421888">before March 11</a>. Also, doing a quick count just now, not including the editorial staff, 178 people helped us out in some way: reviewing sections or chapters, providing images, or clarifying concepts. The kind and generous support we‚Äôve received is one of the reasons I love this field. There‚Äôs competition between companies, between research teams, and all the rest, it‚Äôs part of the landscape. But, underlying this ‚Äúred in&nbsp;tooth and claw‚Äù veneer of competition, most everyone we asked&nbsp;genuinely wanted to share their knowledge and labor to help&nbsp;others understand how things work. I hope it‚Äôs the same in other fields, but I know it‚Äôs true for this one.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;progression of 3 years between 1st and 2nd, 6 between 2nd and 3rd, and 10 between 3rd and 4th is a reflection not so much of&nbsp;the length of time it takes for each new edition (which has indeed steadily increased), but rather how long it takes us to forget all the stress and pain involved in making a new edition. As a data point, our Google Doc of new references since the last edition is around 170 pages long, and does not include references we could easily dismiss, nor those we ran into later when more closely reading and writing. Each page has about 20 references on it (some duplicated among chapters), about 3200 in all. In the fourth edition we added ‚Äúonly‚Äù 1151 new references, and deleted 508 older ones,&nbsp;for a final total of 2059 references (this does not include references on collision detection ‚Äì more on that in a minute).</p>
<p>We could have added all 3200 and more, but&nbsp;instead focused on that which sees&nbsp;use&nbsp;in applications, or is newest and presents a good overview of the state of the art in its area. The field has simply become far too large for us to cover every piece of research, and doing so would have been a disservice to most readers. On the other end of the spectrum, we have continued to avoid API-specific information and code, as there are plenty of books, repositories, and articles describing these ‚Äì this website points to many of them (and will be updated in the coming months). We aim to be a&nbsp;guide to algorithms for practitioners.</p>
<p>To conclude, here‚Äôs the&nbsp;list of chapters:</p>
<p>1 Introduction<br>
2 The Graphics Rendering Pipeline<br>
3 The Graphics Processing Unit<br>
4 Transforms<br>
5 Shading Basics<br>
6 Texturing<br>
7 Shadows<br>
8 Light and Color<br>
9 Physically-Based Shading<br>
10 Local Illumination<br>
11 Global Illumination<br>
12 Image-Space Effects<br>
13 Beyond Polygons<br>
14 Volumetric and Translucency Rendering<br>
15 Non-Photorealistic Rendering<br>
16 Polygonal Techniques<br>
17 Curves and Curved Surfaces<br>
18 Pipeline Optimization<br>
19 Acceleration Algorithms<br>
20 Efficient Shading<br>
21 Virtual and Augmented Reality<br>
22 Intersection Test Methods<br>
23 Graphics Hardware<br>
24 The Future</p>
<p>If you have a great memory, you‚Äôll notice that the ‚ÄúCollision Detection‚Äù chapter from the 3rd edition is missing. We have a fully-updated chapter on this subject for the 4th edition. However, the page count was such that we decided to distribute it, along with the two math-related appendices in the 3rd edition, as online chapters free to download (Collision detection is not strictly a part of real-time <em>rendering</em>, but is an area&nbsp;we think is fascinating and where a fair bit of change has occurred ‚Äì about 40% of the chapter is new material). We‚Äôll be formatting all of these resources into PDF files nearer to release.</p>
<p>Because I have an addiction to text manipulation and analysis programs (more on that in a future blog post), I did some measures of how much the fourth edition is different than the third. The highly-precise but who knows how accurate number I computed was 59.81% new material by lines changed. By further weighting using the character count, I get a value of 68.99% new. These are probably high ‚Äì if you change a word in a sentence, or even just join two lines into one, the whole line is considered new ‚Äì but the takeaway is that a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;has changed in the past decade. We‚Äôve learned a huge amount from writing the book, and by SIGGRAPH look forward to sharing it with you all.</p>
