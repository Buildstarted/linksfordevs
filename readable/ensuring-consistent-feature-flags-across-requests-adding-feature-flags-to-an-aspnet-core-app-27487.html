<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In the <a href="https://andrewlock.net/introducing-the-microsoft-featuremanagement-library-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-1/">first</a> and <a href="https://andrewlock.net/filtering-action-methods-with-feature-flags-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-2/">second posts</a> in this series, I introduced the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FeatureManagement"><em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FeatureManagement"><em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore</em></a> libraries, and showed how to use them to add feature flags to an ASP.NET Core app. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://andrewlock.net/creating-dynamic-feature-flags-with-feature-filters-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-3/">third</a> and <a href="https://andrewlock.net/creating-a-custom-feature-filter-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-4/">fourth posts</a>, I showed how to use feature filters, which let you enable a feature flag based on arbitrary data. For example, you could enable a feature based on headers in an incoming request, based on the current time, or for a certain percentage of users. </p>
<p>I touched on a problem with one such filter, the <code>PercentageFilter</code>, in the <a href="https://andrewlock.net/creating-dynamic-feature-flags-with-feature-filters-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-3/#rolling-features-out-slowly-with-percentagefilter">third post</a>. This filter returns <code>true</code> for <code>IsEnabled()</code> 10% of the time (for example). Unfortunately, if you call the filter multiple times <em>within a single request</em> you could get <em>different</em> results. Not to mention that each request could give a different result for the same user. </p>
<p>In this post I describe two ways to improve the consistency of your feature flags for users. The first approach, using <code>IFeatureManagerSnapshot</code> ensures consistency <em>within</em> a given request. The second approach, using a custom <code>ISessionManager</code>, allows you to extend this consistency <em>between</em> requests.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-different-results-with-every-request-">The problem: different results with every request.<a href="#the-problem-different-results-with-every-request-"></a></h2>
<p>To demonstrate the problem, I'll create a feature flag using the <code>PercentageFilter</code> <a href="https://andrewlock.net/creating-dynamic-feature-flags-with-feature-filters-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-3/#rolling-features-out-slowly-with-percentagefilter">as described in my previous post</a>. I'll use this filter to set a feature flag called "NewExperience", which is configured to be enabled 50% of the time:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"FeatureManagement"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"NewExperience"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"EnabledFor"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>{</span>
          <span>"Name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Microsoft.Percentage"</span><span>,</span>
          <span>"Parameters"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>"Value"</span><span>:</span> <span>50</span>
          <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>]</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>On the home page of the app, I'll inject an <code>IFeatureManager</code> into <em>Index.cshtml</em> and request the value of the feature 10 times:</p>
<pre><code>@page
@model IndexModel
@inject <span>Microsoft<span>.</span>FeatureManagement<span>.</span>IFeatureManager</span> FeatureManager
@<span>{</span>
    ViewData<span>[</span><span>"Title"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Home page"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>&lt;</span>ul<span>&gt;</span>
@<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>li<span>&gt;</span><span>Flag</span> <span>is</span><span>:</span> @FeatureManager<span>.</span><span>IsEnabled</span><span>(</span>FeatureFlags<span>.</span>NewExperience<span>)</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>li<span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>ul<span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the application, you can see that every time you call <code>IsEnabled</code>, there's a 50% chance the flag will be enabled:</p>
<p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2019/featureflag_featuremanager.png" alt="Using IFeatureManager, every call to IsEnabled is independent"></p>
<p>This is very unlikely to be desirable in your application. You almost certainly don't want a flag to flip between enabled and disabled within the context of the same request! Depending on the level of consistency you need, there are two main approaches to solving this. The first is to use <code>IFeatureManagerSnapshot</code>.</p>
<h2 id="maintaining-consistency-within-a-request-with-ifeaturemanagersnapshot">Maintaining consistency within a request with <code>IFeatureManagerSnapshot</code><a href="#maintaining-consistency-within-a-request-with-ifeaturemanagersnapshot"></a></h2>
<p><code>IFeatureManagerSnapshot</code> is registered with the DI container by default when you use feature flags, and acts as a per-request cache for feature flags. It derives from <code>IFeatureManager</code>, so you use it in exactly the same way. You can simply replace the <code>IFeatureManager</code> references with <code>IFeatureManagerSnapshot</code>:</p>
<pre><code>@page
@model IndexModel
@inject <span>Microsoft<span>.</span>FeatureManagement<span>.</span>IFeatureManagerSnapshot</span> SnapshotManager
@<span>{</span>
    ViewData<span>[</span><span>"Title"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Home page"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>&lt;</span>ul<span>&gt;</span>
@<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>li<span>&gt;</span><span>Flag</span> <span>is</span><span>:</span> @SnapshotManager<span>.</span><span>IsEnabled</span><span>(</span>FeatureFlags<span>.</span>NewExperience<span>)</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>li<span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>ul<span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you refresh the page a few times you'll see that within a request, all calls to <code>IsEnabled()</code> return the same value. However, <em>between</em> requests, there's a 50% chance you'll be flipped back and forth between enabled and disabled:</p>
<p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2019/featureflag_snapshotfeaturemanager.png" alt="Using IFeatureManagerSnapshot, all calls to IsEnabled within a request return the same value"></p>
<p>Depending on what you're using your feature flags for, this <em>may</em> be sufficient for your needs. This approach also has an advantage if you have a feature filter that is expensive to calculate - using <code>IFeatureManagerSnapshot</code> caches the value for the whole request, instead of repeatedly re-evaluating it. In general, I feel like <code>IFeatureManagerSnapshot</code> should be the interface you reach for in nearly all cases.</p>
<p>However, it won't solve all your problems. I expect that for most applications, you'll want a <code>PercentageFilter</code> feature flag to persist for all requests by a given user, so the user doesn't see features flipping on and off. If that's the case, you'll want to take a look at <code>ISessionManager</code>.</p>
<h2 id="maintaining-consistency-between-requests-with-isessionmanager">Maintaining consistency between requests with <code>ISessionManager</code><a href="#maintaining-consistency-between-requests-with-isessionmanager"></a></h2>
<p>You can think of <code>ISessionManager</code> as a bit like <code>IFeatureManagerSnapshot</code> on steroids - it's a glorified dictionary of feature flag check results, but you can store the data anywhere you like. An obvious choice might be to use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/app-state?view=aspnetcore-2.2">ASP.NET Core Session</a> feature to store the feature flag results. This would ensure that once a user checks a feature flag, the result (enabled or disabled) persists for that user. That prevents the "flipping back and forth" issue described above. </p>
<p><code>ISessionManager</code> is a small interface to implement, consisting of just two methods:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ISessionManager</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>Set</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> featureName<span>,</span> <span>bool</span> enabled<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>bool</span> <span>TryGet</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> featureName<span>,</span> <span>out</span> <span>bool</span> enabled<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p><code>Set()</code> is called after the value of a feature flag has been determined for the first time, and is used to store the result. <code>TryGet()</code> is called every time <code>IFeatureManager.IsEnabled()</code> is called, to check if a value for the flag has previously been set. If it has, <code>TryGet()</code> returns true, and <code>enabled</code> contains the feature flag result.</p>
<p>The example implementation below shows an <code>ISessionManager</code> implementation that uses the ASP.NET Core Session to store feature flag results:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SessionSessionManager</span> <span>:</span> <span>ISessionManager</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>IHttpContextAccessor</span> _contextAccessor<span>;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>SessionSessionManager</span><span>(</span><span>IHttpContextAccessor</span> contextAccessor<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        _contextAccessor <span>=</span> contextAccessor<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Set</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> featureName<span>,</span> <span>bool</span> enabled<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> session <span>=</span> _contextAccessor<span>.</span>HttpContext<span>.</span>Session<span>;</span>
        <span>var</span> sessionKey <span>=</span> $<span>"feature_{featureName}"</span><span>;</span>
        session<span>.</span><span>Set</span><span>(</span>sessionKey<span>,</span> <span>new</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span>enabled <span>?</span> <span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>1</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>0</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>bool</span> <span>TryGet</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> featureName<span>,</span> <span>out</span> <span>bool</span> enabled<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> session <span>=</span> _contextAccessor<span>.</span>HttpContext<span>.</span>Session<span>;</span>
        <span>var</span> sessionKey <span>=</span> $<span>"feature_{featureName}"</span><span>;</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span>session<span>.</span><span>TryGetValue</span><span>(</span>sessionKey<span>,</span> <span>out</span> <span>var</span> enabledBytes<span>)</span><span>)</span>
        <span>{</span>
            enabled <span>=</span> enabledBytes<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>

        enabled <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As this is using Session (<a href="https://andrewlock.net/session-state-gdpr-and-non-essential-cookies/">which uses a cookie for setting the session ID</a>), you need to access the <code>HttpContext</code>, so you need to <a href="https://andrewlock.net/creating-a-custom-feature-filter-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-4/#creating-the-custom-feature-filter">use the <code>HttpContextAccessor</code></a>. The implementation above is a very thin wrapper around Session: you store the flag result as either a <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, using a different key for each filter, and retrieve the value using the same key. </p>
<p>To enable the <code>ISessionManager</code> you need to add it to the DI container. You also need to add the ASP.NET Core Session services and middleware for this implementation. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that <code>ISessionManager</code> and the FeatureManagement library itself has no dependence on ASP.NET Core Session - it's only required because I chose to use it in this implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Register the <code>ISessionManager</code> and dependent services in <code>Startup.ConfigureServices()</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    
    services<span>.</span><span>AddSession</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    services<span>.</span><span>AddHttpContextAccessor</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    services<span>.</span><span><span>AddTransient</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ISessionManager</span><span>,</span> <span>SessionSessionManager</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    services<span>.</span><span>AddFeatureManagement</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span><span>AddFeatureFilter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>PercentageFilter</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Also, add the session middleware to your middleware pipeline in <code>Startup.Configure()</code>, just before the MVC middleware:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Configure</span><span>(</span><span>IApplicationBuilder</span> app<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    
    app<span>.</span><span>UseSession</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    app<span>.</span><span>UseMvc</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember, the ASP.NET session will be empty until after the session middleware has run, so the <code>ISessionManager</code> will also be empty until then. If you're going to be using feature management early in your middleware pipeline, then you'll want to add the session middleware earlier too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Repeating the same experiment with the <code>ISessionManager</code> in place means you will get consistent feature flags across all requests for the user, until their session ends, or they switch browsers. If you need an even higher degree of consistency (tied to the user's ID rather than their session, so that flags persist browsers, for example) you could implement a different <code>ISessionManager</code>. </p>
<p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2019/featureflag_sessionmanager.png" alt="Using ISessionManager, all calls to IsEnabled while a session exists return the same value"></p>
<p>Overall, <code>ISessionManager</code> is clearly designed to solve the consistency problem, but I think you'll need to be careful how it's used, as the basic implementation shown in this post probably won't cut the mustard.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-with-the-isessionmanger-implementation">Limitations with the <code>ISessionManger</code> implementation<a href="#limitations-with-the-isessionmanger-implementation"></a></h2>
<p>The main issue with my implementation of <code>ISessionManager</code> is that it caches the values of <em>all</em> feature flags in Session. That <em>may</em> be fine, but if you have other feature filters then it's almost certainly not. </p>
<p>Take <a href="https://andrewlock.net/creating-dynamic-feature-flags-with-feature-filters-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-3/#enabling-a-feature-flag-based-on-the-current-time-with-timewindowfilter">the <code>TimeWindowFilter</code> from my previous post</a>, for example. This filter should return <code>false</code> unless the current time is between the configured values. We don't want the <code>ISessionManager</code> to cache the value for an entire session, otherwise the feature filter may <em>never</em> turn on, even as time progresses!</p>
<p>There is a solution to this - restrict the <code>ISessionManager</code> to caching a single feature. For example: </p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>NewExperienceSessionManager</span> <span>:</span> <span>ISessionManager</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Set</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> featureName<span>,</span> <span>bool</span> enabled<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span><span>(</span>featureName <span>!=</span> FeatureFlags<span>.</span>NewExperience<span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>bool</span> <span>TryGet</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> featureName<span>,</span> <span>out</span> <span>bool</span> enabled<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span><span>(</span>featureName <span>!=</span> FeatureFlags<span>.</span>NewExperience<span>)</span> 
        <span>{</span> 
            enabled <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
        
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This approach would technically deal with the issue. But at this point you're looking at creating an <code>ISessionManager</code> <em>per feature</em>. That may be fine; I'm undecided. Personally I think it would be nice to be able to explicitly configure an <code>ISessionManager</code> for each feature in configuration, rather than have the additional layer of indirection the current design requires. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that you can register multiple instances of <code>ISessionManager</code> with the DI container, and the <code>IFeatureManager</code> will call <code>Set()</code> and <code>TryGet()</code> on all of them, hence the <code>ISessionManager</code>-per-feature approach would work ok. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another possible approach would be to avoid the <code>ISessionManager</code> entirely, and instead create feature filters that return a consistent value based on the current user. For example, you could create a custom <code>PercentageFilter</code> that uses the current user's ID as the seed for the random number generator, so the same user ID always returns the same value. This has its own limitations, but it removes the need for an <code>ISessionManager</code> entirely.</p>
<p>Another important limitation, and one that applies to the whole <em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em> library, is that the APIs are all synchronous. No <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> allowed. </p>
<p>This hasn't been a problem in my initial tests with the library, but I could easily imagine a feature filter that requires a database lookup, or an HTTP call - those all become dangerous as you're stuck doing <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/should-i-expose-synchronous-wrappers-for-asynchronous-methods/">sync-over-async</a>. The library fundamentally isn't designed to handle adhoc <code>async</code> tasks like this, which <a href="https://github.com/Azure/AppConfiguration/issues/85">limits the approaches you can take</a>. Any slow or async tasks must run in the background and update the underlying configuration, which the feature filter can then use. </p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary"></a></h2>
<p>In this post I described some of the challenges in maintaining consistent values for your feature flags, especially when using the <code>PecentageFilter</code>, which randomly decides if a flag is enabled every time <code>IsEnabled()</code> is called. I showed how to use <code>IFeatureManagerSnapshot</code> to maintain consistency in feature flag results within a given request. I also introduced <code>ISessionManager</code> which can be used to cache feature flag results <em>between</em> requests. The example implementation I provided uses ASP.NET Core Session to cache the results for a user. This approach has some limitations that are important to bear in mind when implementing in your own projects.</p>
