It's a game engine, a software tool, a music maker and it already has real-world application potential, with this and many other of its features.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Just imagine you're a filmmaker and you wanna make a short film and then submit it to festivals. Or imagine you're a musician and you wanna make an entire album within Dreams, what if that launches your career into stardom? Or a concept of a game like this and you get funding from a big game studio that notices. How insane is that?!</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I hope they use this in schools and universities and colleges. This is groundbreaking. And all for the price of a game. This could literally change your life if you have the drive and ambition. This is fucking mind blowing to me that something that will come out on a console can do this. An all-in-one package. They're right to call this Dreams.</p></div></div></div></div>
