My name is Steve Gordon, and welcome to my course, Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core. I'm a Microsoft MVP, a senior developer working at Madgex Limited, and a passionate member of the .NET community. ASP.NET Core is a blazingly fast web application framework that has been built on the foundation of dependency injection. This course will get you fully up to speed on dependency injection and its use in ASP.NET Core applications. You'll be able to apply these skills to build powerful, real-world ASP.NET Core applications. Some of the major topics that we'll cover include exploring the features provided by the Microsoft dependency injection container, learning how to correctly register services with the dependency injection container, learning how to resolve services via dependency injection across your ASP.NET Core application, and learning how to extend and replace the built-in container when faced with more complex application requirements. By the end of this course, you'll have a complete understanding of the capabilities of the Microsoft dependency injection container. You'll be able to apply this knowledge in your ASP.NET Core applications to take full advantage of the benefits of dependency injection. Before beginning the course, you should be broadly familiar with general ASP.NET Core concepts and have some experience of building ASP.NET applications. I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about the Microsoft dependency injection container with the Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core course at Pluralsight.</p></div></div></div></div>
