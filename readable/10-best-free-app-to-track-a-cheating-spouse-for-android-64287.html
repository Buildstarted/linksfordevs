<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><span>Are you worried that your spouse might be cheating for you? If that is so, I have the perfect solution for you right here. With the methods that I suggested below, you can keep a tab on your partner’s Android phone and find out what they are hiding from you.</span></p><p><span>I have tried and tested each one of the methods that I am going to talk about. Therefore, everything I say is proven and none of it is hearsay. After all, I want you to have the proper knowledge and opinion about an app before you try it out.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, without waiting any longer, let me start with the five best ways to catch a cheating spouse by monitoring their Android phone.</span></p><h2><b>Part 1: Best Free Android Spy Apps to Catch a Cheating Spouse- Minspy</b></h2><p><span>When the issue is as serious as finding out if your spouse is cheating on you, there is no app better than Minspy.</span></p><p><span>Minspy is regarded as the world’s best phone monitor, no matter which way you look at it. With millions of users spread all over the world, Minspy enjoys a popularity that other phone monitoring apps find hard to match.</span></p><p><span>Minspy allows you to track your spouse’s phone, no matter whether they are using an Android phone or an iPhone. However, for the purpose of this guide, I will only focus on Minspy’s Android spying solution. I think Minspy is the best </span><a href="https://minspy.com/phone-spy/free-android-spy-apps-cheating-spouse/"><span>free Android spy app to catch a cheating spouse</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Your spouse might be clever and delete any traces of them cheating present on their phone. Yet, they still cannot hide from Minspy. Minspy shows you each and every bit of data present on their phone, including the data they have deleted.</span></p><p><img src="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-search.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-search.png 800w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-search-350x175.png 350w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-search-640x320.png 640w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-search-768x384.png 768w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-search-400x200.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 25vw, (max-width: 780px) 40vw, (max-width: 1080px) 30vw, (max-width: 1280px) 30vw, (max-width: 1600px) 30vw, 800px"></p><h3><b>What Makes Minspy the Best Cheating Spy App?</b></h3><p><span>There are many reasons which make Minspy better than any other app you might use to catch your spouse cheating. Let me talk about a few of these reasons here:</span></p><h4><b>Secret Android Monitor:</b></h4><p><span>When you are using Minspy to keep track of your spouse’s activity, they will never find out about it. This is because Minspy’s Android monitor is designed to be completely quiet and secretive. It works without any chances of the target user knowing about it.</span></p><h4><b>Web Based Spy App:</b></h4><p><span>You might be worried about your spouse noticing a spy app installed on your phone. However, there is no such concern when it comes to Minspy. Minspy has a web based dashboard, that you can access from any web browser that you use.</span></p><h4><b>No Root Needed:</b></h4><p><span>You do not have to root your spouse’s Android phone in order to view their data. This is unlike most cheating spouse apps, which require rooting their phone is the first step. By not asking you to root their phone, Minspy takes a big burden off your chest.</span></p><h4><b>Data Privacy:</b></h4><p><span>Your spouse’s phone has a lot of data that you might want to keep private between you two. This is why Minspy does not store any of this private data on its servers. Even Minspy’s own team cannot view this data.</span></p><p><span>There are many, MANY other benefits of using Minspy for catching your spouse cheating. However, I will leave it to you to explore these benefits when you use Minspy. You can even get a sneak peek into Minspy through its free web demo.</span></p><h3><b>How Minspy Catches Your Spouse Cheating ‘Secretly’?</b></h3><p><span>When you are using Minspy to keep an eye on your spouse’s activities, they never find out about it. This is because Minspy’s Android solution is designed to be completely hidden.</span></p><p><span>As a basic rule, any Android phone monitoring app needs to be installed on the phone which you wish to monitor, i.e. your spouse’s phone. This rule applies to Minspy as well as any other working Android spy app.</span></p><p><span>It might make you think that your spouse will find out that you have a hidden spy app installed on their phone. However, that is not the case; Minspy is designed to handle the problem quite well.</span></p><p><span>Minspy’s Android app is less than 3 MB in size, which means that it takes only a few seconds to install it on your partner’s phone. Once the app is installed, you can choose to hide the app icon from their app menu.</span></p><p><span>The app runs on the background of their phone without triggering any notifications. It will not even consume any battery at all.</span></p><p><span>And if you feel the need to uninstall the app, you can do it remotely through Minspy’s web dashboard, which can open on any device’s web browser.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, after the first time access (that too for a few seconds), you never have to touch your spouse’s phone ever again.</span></p><p><i><span>**All working cheating spouse apps for Android phones will need the app installed on your spouse’s phone. If any app claims to spy on your spouse’s Android phone without app installation, that app is a scam and you should stay away from it!**</span></i></p><h3><b>Minspys’s Cheating Spouse Buster Features</b></h3><p><span>There are many features in Minspy that are designed exactly for you, so you can catch your spouse cheating on you with proof of it. Here are a few of these features (keep in mind that there are many more of them):</span></p><h4><b>Social Media Monitor:</b></h4><p><span>If your spouse is cheating on you, your social media will definitely have traces of it. Minspy lets you read their social media private messages for apps like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, and many more.</span></p><p><img src="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-message.png" alt="" width="1315" height="895" srcset="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-message.png 1315w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-message-350x238.png 350w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-message-640x436.png 640w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-message-768x523.png 768w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-message-1200x817.png 1200w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-message-800x544.png 800w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-message-400x272.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 25vw, (max-width: 780px) 40vw, (max-width: 1080px) 30vw, (max-width: 1280px) 30vw, (max-width: 1600px) 30vw, 800px"></p><h4><b>Location Tracker:</b></h4><p><span>Minspy lets you keep a tab on their location in real-time. Not only can you view their live location 24×7, you also get to see their recent locations along with the timestamps. It even comes with geofencing, which tracks your spouse’s location when you are busy.</span></p><p><img src="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-map.png" alt="" width="1315" height="850" srcset="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-map.png 1315w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-map-350x226.png 350w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-map-640x414.png 640w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-map-768x496.png 768w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-map-1200x776.png 1200w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-map-800x517.png 800w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-map-400x259.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 25vw, (max-width: 780px) 40vw, (max-width: 1080px) 30vw, (max-width: 1280px) 30vw, (max-width: 1600px) 30vw, 800px"></p><h4><b>Call Tracker:</b></h4><p><span>The call tracker feature lets you monitor all their incoming and outgoing phone calls. The call logs come with caller details such as caller phone number, address, etc. You can even record the phone calls if you want.</span></p><p><img src="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-people.png" alt="" width="512" height="326" srcset="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-people.png 512w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-people-350x223.png 350w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/minspy-people-400x255.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 25vw, (max-width: 780px) 40vw, (max-width: 1080px) 30vw, (max-width: 1280px) 30vw, (max-width: 1600px) 30vw, 800px"></p><h4><b>Keylogger:</b></h4><p><span>Minspy’s keylogger feature gives you access to all the keystrokes that the user has typed on their phone. This even includes their usernames and passwords as well. You can even view their web searches and anything else they have typed.</span></p><p><span>There are several other features that come with Minspy, each one designed to give you more and more access to your spouse’s phone data. If you want to see how these features look in action, you can always check Minspy’s demo on their website.</span></p><h2><b>Part 2: Cheating App for Android Phone- Spyine</b></h2><p><span>Even though Minspy is the best app in the area of monitoring your cheating spouses, there are some apps that come close to it and give it a tough competition.</span></p><p><a href="https://spyine.com/"><span>Spyine</span></a><span> is one such app that can catch your spouse right in the act along with giving you the evidence for it. Just like Minspy, Spyine works without asking you to root or jailbreak the target device.</span></p><p><img src="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/spyine-box.png" alt="" width="260" height="360" srcset="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/spyine-box.png 260w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/spyine-box-253x350.png 253w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 25vw, (max-width: 780px) 40vw, (max-width: 1080px) 30vw, (max-width: 1280px) 30vw, (max-width: 1600px) 30vw, 800px"></p><p><span>Spyine has been offering Android monitoring services as long as Android phones have been around. It is present on the phones of most spouses, as even if they are not cheating Spyine comes to be of help even then. It never hurts to take precautions.</span></p><h2><b>Part3: Cheating Spy App Free-Spyier</b></h2><p><span>Spyier is another great well established cheating spouse tracker that has been offering its services for some years now. Spyier’s Android tracker is designed to be totally easy so even the most tech inexperienced people can use it without facing difficulties.</span></p><p><img src="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/spyier-box.png" alt="" width="350" height="485" srcset="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/spyier-box.png 350w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/spyier-box-253x350.png 253w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 25vw, (max-width: 780px) 40vw, (max-width: 1080px) 30vw, (max-width: 1280px) 30vw, (max-width: 1600px) 30vw, 800px"></p><p><span>The thing that I like about Spyier is its user support process. Whenever anyone faces an issue, Spyier’s user support team instantly resolves it. They pay quite a focus on customer support both before and after a user has its subscription.</span></p><p><span>This says a lot about an app, especially when it comes to trust. Therefore, you can use Spyier without any second thoughts.</span></p><h2><b>Part 4: Spy Apps for Cheating Spouses Free-Cocospy</b></h2><p><span>Cocospy is one of the oldest phone monitoring apps, and undoubtedly one of the best. You will see Cococspy in most top ten lists that talk about catching a cheating spouse or monitoring your child’s activities. Cocospy is good for all purposes.</span></p><p><img src="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cocospy-box.png" alt="" width="161" height="200"></p><p><span>Since Cocospy has been around for such a long time, it supports all Android phone versions and models out there. There are no compatibility issues that you are going to face with Cocospy. Its interface is quite flawless and there are no bugs you will find anywhere.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, if you want to choose a good and reputed app, Cocospy can never let you down.</span></p><h2><b>Part 5: Android Spy Apps Cheating Spouse- Spyic</b></h2><p><span>I first found out about Spyic after reading a really positive review from an authority media outlet. That led me to go through a series of similar reviews on countless tech media outlets talking really good stuff about Spyic.</span></p><p><img src="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/spyic-box.png" alt="" width="350" height="435" srcset="https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/spyic-box.png 350w, https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/spyic-box-282x350.png 282w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 25vw, (max-width: 780px) 40vw, (max-width: 1080px) 30vw, (max-width: 1280px) 30vw, (max-width: 1600px) 30vw, 800px"></p><p><span>Then I tried out Spyic to check what the fuss was all about and I realized everything they said was true. Spyic was indeed a perfect phone monitoring solution for Android phones.</span></p><p><span>Spyic can monitor any Android phone, just taking no more than five minutes to set up. Once you have setup Spyic, getting your spouse’s private data is instantaneous.</span></p><p><span>It is another web app that you can use from any device, be it your phone, computer, or a tablet. You just need to open it through the device’s web browser.</span></p><h2><b>Part 6: Cheaters App for Android-Spyera</b></h2><p><span>Spyera is another popular Android spying solution, or I should say it used to be a popular Android monitoring solution. However, times have changed and a few discrepancies here and there have led Spyera to slip down in the list.</span></p><p><span>Spyera offers a good number of features comparable to the top entries in the list. Its interface fits those features very well and there are no problems you will find in that area.</span></p><p><span>The major deal-breaking issue is that you need to root your spouse’s Android phone in order to make it work. This is what keeps most people from using Spyera to monitor their spouse’s activity.</span></p><p><span>Not just that, even though Spyera requires you to root their phone, its price is costlier than other entries on this list. This is why other entries on this list have taken Spyera’s place and are used more than it.</span></p><h2><b>Part 7: Android Spy Apps Cheating Spouse-Secureteen</b></h2><p><span>While Secureteen is an app designed to monitor your child’s activities, it is just as good for keeping an eye on your spouse’s data too.</span></p><p><span>Secureteen is a toned down version of the apps so far on this list that are above it. Therefore, it lacks many features that you will find in apps of the likes of Minspy and Spyier. This is what makes Secureteen less popular than the above apps.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, you can use Secureteen if you have tried the above apps for a while and you want something very basic. It is not really a suggested phone spy app for first time users, as they miss out on many features that they can get with a phone monitoring solution.</span></p><h2><b>Part 8: Apps for Cheating Spouse- Hellospy</b></h2><p><span>Hellospy used to be a commonly used app if you were considering it a few years ago. However, lack of frequent updates and some bugs here and there have made Hellospy slide down in the competition.</span></p><p><span>Hellospy needs you to root the target device in order to work. It can be seen as a last resort if you do not like the other apps that I mentioned (which is improbable).</span></p><h2><b>Part 9: Catch Your Spouse Cheating App- Mobistealth</b></h2><p><span>Mobistealth provides Android monitoring solution to track your spouse or your children. It has a moderate user base and average reviews, neither too good nor too bad.</span></p><p><span>While you won’t be disappointed if you use Mobistealth, there is nothing much you will like about it if you have used apps like Spyic. Mobistealth offers less than what other apps offer, at a price that is not lesser. This is why people prefer Mobistealth less than other apps.</span></p><h2><b>Part 10: Apps to Spy on Spouse- Mspy</b></h2><p><span>What Mspy does well in marketing its phone monitoring services, it lacks in the ability to improve the services. While its phone monitoring services work to track your spouse’s activities, there are a lot of downtimes which can make Mspy less recommended.</span></p><p><span>Further, even though the quality of service is low, the price of the service is very high as compared to other entries in the list. Therefore, use Mspy only as a last resort.</span></p><h2><b>Part 11: Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2><p><span>Here are some commonly asked questions along with the answers to these questions:</span></p><h3><b>Q: Do I need to root my spouse’s phone to track its data?</b></h3><p><span>While most apps require you to root your spouse’s phone, really good apps such as Minspy can work without needing it.</span></p><h3><b>Q: Can I monitor my spouse’s phone without touching it?</b></h3><p><span>No, you need at least a one time access to your partner’s Android phone so you can install the monitoring application on it. This is true for all Android phones, regardless of which app you use.</span></p><h3><b>Q: Can I track my spouse’s live location?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, you can view the live location of your partner through all the apps that I have mentioned above in this list.</span></p><h3><b>Q: How long does it take to set up these spouse monitoring apps?</b></h3><p><span>For the best apps out there, it will take you no more than five minutes for the setup process, just for the first time. Once the app is set up, you do not have to wait even for a minute to monitor your spouse’s phone.</span></p><h3><b>Q: Do I have to be in the same room to monitor my spouse’s phone?</b></h3><p><span>No, there is no such requirement. You can monitor your spouse’s phone even from a whole other corner of the world. All you will need is internet access.</span></p><h2><b>Wrapping Up</b></h2><p><span>Now you know about the best apps to catch your spouse cheating, along with the proof. You can use any of these apps freely and the choice is just yours. Therefore, start monitoring right away, the sooner the better!</span></p>
