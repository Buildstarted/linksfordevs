They should protect a billion of data structures. It sounds tedious! How can we do that providing a high performance, maintainable and testable code and in a reasonable time?</p><p>Don't worry, Matryoshka is a framework that makes it possible to browse your data structures using recursion schemes, and if you use it with low-level Spark, you get the best of both worlds. Join us and we'll show you how we did it!</p><h3>Required Knowledge</h3><p>You should be familiar with basic Scala and Spark, some high level functional programming experience can be useful but our goal is to guide you step by step.</p></div><h3>Speaker(s)</h3><div class="speaker"><img src="https://scaladays.org/assets/images/speakers/wiem-zine-el-abidine.jpg"><p><strong>Wiem Zine El Abidine</strong><br><span><a href="https://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank"></a></span></p></div><p>Wiem Zine Elabidine, is a Scala Backend Developer at MOIA, loves her job and she is OSS contributor.
