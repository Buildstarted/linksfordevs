    <p>
        Greetings and salutations internet person! Have you ever pissed off a customer so much they bought a domain and stood up a website to shit on your asinine and boneheaded business practices? GE just did.</p>
    <p>
        I just wanted a tall, cold, refreshing glass of water at 3am only to be greeted by a fucking atomic countdown on my trusty cold water and ice dispensing pal.
    </p>
    <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/liquid_communism.jpg" alt="My fridge being an asshole warning me that I only have seven days before it becomes self aware and attempts to disable its own water system">

    <p>
        What happens in seven days? I have seen filter alarms before- this was new. I have never had a count down on my fridge before. At this point in the story I figure this is a "Please Reorder Soon" alarm. Then I made a mistake- I googled this when I was in bed. <b>My fridge was going to disable its own ice and water system if I did not succumb to its strong-arm appliance extortion tactics.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        I knew that I had to dig, I was willing to bet that there was just some analog enable signal I could trip to bypass this stupid thing. I dug through the schematics... Nope the entire appliance has its own communications bus. The dispense board/main board interrogates the drm/rfid board and asks questions about filter status before it will command parts to do their fucking job and send signals to the relays that run the water/ice maker relays.
    </p>

    <p>
        So my fridge has a water-nazi-mini-hitler circuit board in it, I just had to see it.

    <p>
        What gives? Well some asshole at GE thought it would be a good idea to include a fucking RFID DRM module in select refrigerators.

    </ul>
    <p>From the patents it looks like I can thank inventors Mr. Krause and Mr. Chernov for their freedom sucking, major appliance disabling, communist, 1984-esque idea. From what I am reading- with every press of the dispense switch the control board asks the drm board "Please sir, may I dispense some water for my loving owners." See the advanced dramatization below.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
        No one ever told me about the filter counterfeiting consortium, I really doubt authentic filters are a huge problem, never have been for me anyway. However, I do know a thing or two about how companies have been trying to do shit like this since the dawn of the automobile. I am sure Mr. Edisons' GE would have loved the idea that no one could sell parts but him! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Patents_Company" target="_blank">Since he basically monopolized the entire motion picture industry.</a> </p>

    <p>
        Take a peek at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnuson%E2%80%93Moss_Warranty_Act" target="_blank">Magnuson Moss</a>; From the wiki "Warrantors cannot require that only branded parts be used with the product in order to retain the warranty.[7] This is commonly referred to as the "tie-in sales" provisions[8] and is frequently mentioned in the context of third-party computer parts, such as memory and hard drives."
    </p>
    
    Methods:
    <ol>
        <li>The Bypass, Bypass method: <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/hack-rwpfe-water-filters-ge-fridge/">first described here</a> With this method you take the rfid stamp from a "bypass" cartridge and simply slap it on whatever filter you damn well please. However when I attempted this it would seem that the evil empire GE has modified their manufacturing technique so tag extraction will be a little more fun now.
            <p>
                <u>First Extraction Attempt (Failure)</u><br>
                a) As noted elsewhere on the internet the tag is located under the "Back" Label:
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/attempt1_1.jpg" width="95%"><br>
                b) The tag was able to be lifted easily with a knife.
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/attempt1_3.jpg" width="95%"><br>
                c) Sadly the actual rfid chip is encased in glue and what I just ripped out was the antenna:
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/attempt1_4.jpg" width="95%"><br>
                <u>Second Extraction Attempt (Success)</u><br>
                a) This time I took a dremel to the bypass cartridge
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/fuk_u_ge.jpg" width="95%"><br>
                b) Then I took the only tools you will need for this job<br>
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/e_toolage.jpg" width="50%"><br>
                c) Now to simply remove the one phillips screw covering the pointless DRM board cover<br>
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/hidded-trapdoor-of-fail.jpg" width="45%">
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/the_shame_panel.jpg" width="45%"><br>
                d) Now we will tape our little RFID bypass tag to the back of the board. Cool thing is that the compartment for the RFID board has a huge void that perfectly fits the tag we cut out.
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/hans_get_ze_tape.jpg" width="45%">
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/rfid_holio.jpg" width="32%"><br>
                e) Now we just reinsert the board<br>
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/hidded-trapdoor-of-fail.jpg" width="30%"><br>
                f) For the last step you need to remove the RFID tag from the old filter if you intend to continue to use it.<br>
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/old_cart.jpg" width="45%">
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/old_cart_notag.jpg" width="41%"><br>
                g) Enjoy your filter freedom.<br>
                <img src="https://gefiltergate.com/hashtag_winnin.jpg" width="35%">             
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>The Swap-a-roo method: With this method you simply keep one old filter- I have been told that some folks just take an old filter and swap it with their new one. The tag memory would appear to be extremely limited.</li>
    </ol>
