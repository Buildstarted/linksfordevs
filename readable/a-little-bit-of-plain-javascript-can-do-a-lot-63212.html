<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’ve never worked as a professional frontend developer, so even though I’ve
been writing HTML/CSS/JS for 15 years for little side projects, all of the
projects have been pretty small, sometimes I don’t write any Javascript for
years in between, and I often don’t quite feel like I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p>Partly because of that, I’ve leaned on libraries a lot! Ten years ago I used to
use jQuery, and since maybe 2017 I’ve been using a lot of vue.js for my little
Javascript projects (you can see a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/06/26/vue-js-fun/">little whack-a-mole game I made here as an
intro to Vue</a>).</p>
<p>But last week, for the first time in a while, I wrote some plain
Javascript without a library and it was fun so I wanted to talk about it a bit!</p>
<h3 id="experimenting-with-just-plain-javascript">experimenting with just plain Javascript</h3>
<p>I really like Vue. But last week when I started building
<a href="https://questions.wizardzines.com/">https://questions.wizardzines.com</a>, I had slightly different constraints than
usual – I wanted to use the same HTML to generate both a PDF (with
<a href="https://www.princexml.com/">Prince</a>) and to make an interactive version of the questions.</p>
<p>I couldn’t really see how that would work with Vue (because Vue wants to create
all the HTML itself), and because it was a small project I decided to try
writing it in plain Javascript with no libraries – just write some HTML/CSS
and add a single <code>&lt;script src="js/script.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>I hadn’t done this in a while, and I learned a few things along the way that
made it easier than I thought it would be when I started.</p>
<h3 id="do-almost-everything-by-adding-removing-css-classes">do almost everything by adding &amp; removing CSS classes</h3>
<p>I decided to implement almost all of the UI by just adding &amp; removing CSS
classes, and using <a href="https://3dtransforms.desandro.com/card-flip">CSS transitions</a> if I want to animate a transition.</p>
<p>here’s a small example, where clicking the “next” question button adds the “done” class to the parent div.</p>
<pre><code>div.querySelector('.next-question').onclick = function () {
    show_next_row();
    this.parentElement.parentElement.classList.add('done');
}
</code></pre>
<p>This worked pretty well. My CSS as always is a bit of a mess but it felt
manageable.</p>
<h3 id="add-remove-css-classes-with-classlist">add/remove CSS classes with <code>.classList</code></h3>
<p>I started out by editing the classes like this: <code>x.className = 'new list of
classes'</code>. That felt a bit messy though and I wondered if there was a better
way. And there was!</p>
<p>You can also add CSS classes like this:</p>
<pre><code>let x = document.querySelector('div');
x.classList.add('hi');
x.classList.remove('hi');
</code></pre>
<p><code>element.classList.remove('hi')</code> is way cleaner than what I was doing before.</p>
<h3 id="find-elements-with-document-queryselectorall">find elements with <code>document.querySelectorAll</code></h3>
<p>When I started learning jQuery I remember thinking that if you wanted to easily
find something in the DOM you had to use jQuery (like <code>$('.class')</code>). I just
learned this week that you can actually write
<code>document.querySelectorAll('.some-class')</code> instead, and then you don’t need to
depend on any library!</p>
<p>I got curious about when <code>querySelectorAll</code> was introduced. I Googled a tiny
bit and it looks like the [Selectors API was built sometime between 2008 and
2013 – I found a <a href="https://johnresig.com/blog/thoughts-on-queryselectorall/">post from the jQuery author discussing the proposed
implementation in
2008</a>, and <a href="https://tiffanybbrown.com/2011/08/12/meet-the-selectors-api/">a blog
post from 2011</a>
saying it was in all major browsers by then, so maybe it didn’t exist when I
started using jQuery but it’s definitely been around for quite a while :)</p>
<h3 id="set-innerhtml">set <code>.innerHTML</code></h3>
<p>In one place I wanted to change a button’s HTML contents. Creating DOM elements
with <code>document.createElement</code> is pretty annoying, so I tried to do that as
little as possible and instead set <code>.innerHTML</code> to the HTML string I wanted:</p>
<pre><code>    button.innerHTML = `&lt;i class="icon-lightbulb"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;I learned something!
    &lt;object data="/confetti.svg" width="30" height = "30"&gt; &lt;/object&gt;
    `;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="scroll-through-the-page-with-scrollintoview">scroll through the page with <code>.scrollIntoView</code></h3>
<p>The last fun thing I learned about is <code>.scrollIntoView</code> – I wanted to scroll down to the next question automatically when someone clicked “next question”. Turns out this is just one line of code:</p>
<pre><code>row.classList.add('revealed');
row.scrollIntoView({behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center'});
</code></pre>
<h3 id="another-vanilla-js-example-peekobot">another vanilla JS example: peekobot</h3>
<p>Another small example of a plain JS library I thought was nice is
<a href="https://peekobot.github.io/peekobot/">peekobot</a>, which is a little chatbot
interface that’s 100 lines of JS/CSS.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://github.com/Peekobot/peekobot/blob/master/peekobot.js">its Javascript</a>,
it uses some similar patterns – a lot of <code>.classList.add</code>, some adding
elements to the DOM, some <code>.querySelectorAll</code>.</p>
<p>I learned from reading peekobot’s source about
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest">.closest</a>
which finds the closest ancestor that matches a given selector. That seems like
it would be a nice way to get rid of some of the <code>.parentElement.parentElement</code>
that I was writing in my Javascript, which felt a bit fragile.</p>
<h3 id="plain-javascript-can-do-a-lot">plain Javascript can do a lot!</h3>
<p>I was pretty surprised by how much I could get done with just plain JS. I ended
up writing about 50 lines of JS to do everything I wanted to do, plus a bit
extra to collect some anonymous metrics about what folks were learning.</p>
<p>As usual with my frontend posts, this isn’t meant to be Serious Frontend
Engineering Advice – my goal is to be able to write little websites with less
than 200 lines of Javascript that mostly work. If you are also flailing around
in frontend land I hope this helps a bit!</p>
