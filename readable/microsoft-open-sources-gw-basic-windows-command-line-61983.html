In 1983, ‚ÄúStar Wars Episode VI ‚Äì Return of the Jedi‚Äù was released, as was ‚ÄúWar Games‚Äù! And, Emily Blunt, Kate Mara, Jonah Hill, Chris Hemsworth, and Henry Cavill, were born!

When not coding, I was usually playing one of the most groundbreaking games of all time: ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elite</a>‚Äù by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Braben" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Braben</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bell_(programmer)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ian Bell</a>.</p><p>In 1983, Apple launched the 1MHz <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6502" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">6502</a>-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple IIe</a> for US$1,395 (&gt; $3,500 in 2020). Apple also launched the first commercially available computer with a GUI ‚Äì the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple Lisa</a>. The Lisa contained a staggering 1MB RAM, and ran the awesome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Motorola 68000</a> processor at an astounding 5MHz, but it cost $9,995 (&gt; $25,000 in 2020 dollars), so all I could do was peer at it through the window of the one computer store in our town authorized to sell Apple‚Äôs products ‚Ä¶ and dream.</p><p>And, in 1983 Microsoft released MS-DOS 2.0 (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">source here</a>), and GW-BASIC for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM PC XT</a> and compatibles.</p><h2>What IS GW-BASIC?</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GW-BASIC</a> was a BASIC interpreter derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_BASIC#IBM_Advanced_BASIC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM‚Äôs Advanced BASIC/BASICA</a>, which itself was a port of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBASIC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Microsoft BASIC</a>.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_BASIC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Microsoft‚Äôs various BASIC implementations</a> can trace their origins all the way back to Bill Gates &amp; Paul Allen‚Äôs implementation of Microsoft‚Äôs first product ‚Äì a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800</a>.</p><p>During the late ‚Äô70s and 80s, Microsoft‚Äôs BASIC was ported to many OEM‚Äôs specific platform and hardware needs, and for several processors popular at that time, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">8088</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">6502</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6809" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">6809</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Z80</a>, and others.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Wait ‚Äì where‚Äôs the C source code?</h3><p>There is no C source code!</p><p>Like much software from the 70s and 80s, and just like <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the source for MS-DOS</a>, the source code of GW-BASIC is 100% assembly language.</p><h3>Why assembly? Why didn‚Äôt developers use higher-level languages like C, or Pascal?</h3><p>When developing on/for mainframes and minicomputers of the day, developers were sometimes able to use higher-level languages like FORTRAN, LISP, COBOL, RPG, CPL/BCPL, C, etc. but the compilers for such languages were often hugely expensive, rarely generated efficient code, and were generally unavailable for the space and performance constrained home and personal computers of the day.</p><p>When writing software for early PCs, every single byte and every single instruction mattered, so developers often wrote code entirely in assembly language simply to be able to physically fit their software into the available memory, and to be able to access the computer‚Äôs resources and internal workings.</p><p>Thus, all the source code for GW-BASIC is pure assembly code, translated on a per-processor/per-machine basis from core/master sources.</p><h3>This source was ‚Äòtranslated‚Äô?</h3><p>Each of the assembly source files contains a header stating <code><span>This</span><span> translation created </span><span>10</span><span>-</span><span>Feb</span><span>-</span><span>83</span><span> </span><span>by</span><span> </span><span>Version</span><span> </span><span>4.3</span></code></p><p>Since the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of the early processors used in home and personal computers weren‚Äôt spectacularly different from one another, Microsoft was able to generate a substantial amount of the code for a port from the sources of a master implementation. (Alas, sorry, we‚Äôre unable to open-source the ISA translator.)</p><h3>What about other ports?</h3><p>Many have asked if we can also open-source implementations for processors other than the 808x. Alas, we‚Äôre unable to provide sources for these ports and/or customizations.</p><h2>Enjoy!</h2><p>We hope you enjoy exploring this fascinating snapshot of what software development looked like during the glorious, exciting, heady days of the ‚Äô70s and early ‚Äô80s at the dawn of ‚Äúthe personal computer‚Äù üòÅ</p><p><em>Many thanks to Amy, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-liuson-6703441/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Julia Luison</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/amandaksilver" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amanda Silver</a>, and our awesome CELA team for their approval and help finding, reviewing, and open-sourcing GW-BASIC</em>.</p></div></div></div></div>
