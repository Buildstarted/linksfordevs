    <h1>GitHub Actions Day 1: CI/CD Triggers</h1>
    <div class="blogentry-body"> <blockquote> <p>This is day 1 of my GitHub Actions Advent Calendar. If you want
to see the whole list of tips as they&apos;re published, see the
<a href="/blog/github_actions_advent_calendar.html">index</a>.</p>
</blockquote> <p>GitHub Actions is a unique system: it provides CI/CD build functionality -
the ability to build and test pull requests and merges into your master
branch - but it&apos;s <em>more</em> than just a build system. It&apos;s integrated into
GitHub and can run workflows <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows">whenever any event happens in your repository</a>,
like a release being created or an issue being commented on.</p> <p>I&apos;ll talk more about those repository automation scenarios throughout the
month, but knowing that this flexibility exists is helpful for understanding
how to get your CI/CD builds setup. GitHub Actions lets you define a <em>trigger</em> that controls when your workflow runs. Whenever an action
matching that trigger happens in your repository, a workflow run will be
queued up.</p> <p>For CI/CD workflows, I like to use the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#push-event-push"><code>push</code></a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-event-pull_request"><code>pull_request</code></a> triggers,
and scope it to the branches that I&apos;m interested in. For example:</p> <div class="language-yaml highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay"> <div class="code"><pre><span class="key">on</span>: <span class="key">push</span>: <span class="key">branches</span>: - <span class="string"><span class="content">master</span></span> <span class="key">pull_request</span>: <span class="key">branches</span>: - <span class="string"><span class="content">master</span></span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div> <p>This trigger will run your workflow on any change to the master branch -
(even though it&apos;s named the <code>push</code> trigger, it will run when you run
<code>git push</code> <em>or</em> when you merge a pull request into the master branch).
The workflow will also run for any pull request that&apos;s opened against
the master branch, and it will show you validation in the pull request.</p> <p><img src="/blog/images/githubactions/1-prvalidation.png" alt="Pull Request Validation"></p> <p>If you&apos;re familiar with YAML syntax, you might note that branches takes
an array. So you can easily set up a workflow to run in multiple
branches, which is useful if you maintain separate release tracks.
For example:</p> <div class="language-yaml highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay"> <div class="code"><pre><span class="key">on</span>: <span class="key">push</span>: <span class="key">branches</span>: - <span class="string"><span class="content">master</span></span> - <span class="string"><span class="content">&apos;releases/**&apos;</span></span> <span class="key">pull_request</span>: <span class="key">branches</span>: - <span class="string"><span class="content">master</span></span> - <span class="string"><span class="content">&apos;releases/**&apos;</span></span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div> <p>Will run your workflow whenever a pull request is opened against the
master branch <em>or</em> a branch <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestbranchestags">whose name starts with <code>releases/</code></a>.</p> <p>The <code>push</code> and <code>pull_request</code> triggers make it easy to set up a CI/CD
style workflow to validate pull requests and merges into your master
branch with GitHub Actions.</p> </div>
