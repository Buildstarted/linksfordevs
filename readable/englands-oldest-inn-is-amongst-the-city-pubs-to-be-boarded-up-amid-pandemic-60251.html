The Bell Inn, in Angel Row, and the Water's Edge, in Castle Bridge Road, also have wooden boards at the windows.</p> <figure data-mod="image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" data-observed="true">

</figure> <p>Nottingham councillor, Sam Webster, portfolio holder for finance, growth and the city centre, said it's a sight he never thought he'd see.</p> <p>"While we never like to see boarded up business premises and never expected to see Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem boarded up, we can take heart that this is only a temporary security measure as those in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors protect their businesses during the pandemic.</p> <p>"What is heartening is the thoughtfulness of staff at the Trip in providing a message to support for the NHS staff and key workers who are working so hard to keep people safe and well, which is a wonderful gesture from an iconic Nottingham business.</p> <p>“We’ve pulled together a directory of support from Nottingham City Council, Central Government and local partners who can support businesses during the Coronavirus outbreak.</p> <figure data-mod="image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" data-observed="true">
