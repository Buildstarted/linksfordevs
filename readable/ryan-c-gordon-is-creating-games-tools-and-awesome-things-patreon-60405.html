<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div data-tag="summary-container"><p>Hi, my name is Ryan, and you might know me if you've played a video game on Linux.</p><p><a href="https://icculus.org/resume" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">My full-time job</a> is porting games to various platforms, but my passion is building interesting things out of thin air.</p><p>I've got a lot of side projects that are great--some are big awesome games, some are simple-but-useful utilities--and these projects compete for my attention with paying work. And when they compete with paying work, they always lose.</p><p>What are these side projects? Here are a few.</p><p>I made Unreal Tournament&nbsp;<a href="https://icculus.org/ut99-emscripten/" target="_blank">run in a web browser</a>:</p><p><img src="https://icculus.org/ut99-emscripten/screenshot.png"></p><p>My&nbsp;<a href="https://hg.icculus.org/icculus/mojoelf/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MojoELF</a> project runs Linux apps on Mac OS X, like this game:</p><p><img src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/macelf-ioquake3.png"></p><p>Do you use 1Password? Try out&nbsp;<a href="https://icculus.org/1pass" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1pass</a>, and use your keychains on Linux.<br><img src="https://icculus.org/1pass/1pass.png"></p><p>Need to organize your Steam library? I wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://steamtags.icculus.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamTags</a> for that.</p><p><img src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/steamtags.png"></p><p>Need a Linux installer for your app?&nbsp;<a href="https://icculus.org/mojosetup/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MojoSetup</a> can save the day.</p><p><img src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/mojosetup.png"></p><p>Want to learn to program? Check out my&nbsp;<a href="https://icculus.org/toby/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Toby</a> programming language.</p><p><img src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/toby.png"></p><p>I maintain lots of other game development tools that aren't so pretty, but are extremely important:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SDL</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://icculus.org/physfs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PhysicsFS</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://icculus.org/mojoshader/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MojoShader</a>, to name a few, and pop out fun little pieces of open source with some frequency, like&nbsp;<a href="https://hg.icculus.org/icculus/mojozork/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Zork interpreters</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://inline-reddit.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">better ways to read reddit</a>.</p><p>My goal with this Patreon is to keep work moving on these projects, and many others, and keep converting new ideas into shipping code.</p><p>Here are some immediate things I'd like to do with patron funding:</p><ul><li>Improve 1pass, so it's a complete password manager instead of a stopgap measure.</li><li>Update older games that need bug fixes and improvements.</li><li>Finish the next major version of PhysicsFS.</li><li>Get MojoELF to run Unreal Tournament '99, since there is literally no way to play the Mac version in modern times.</li></ul><p>There are stretch goals: there's a whole backlog of games to be ported that won't ever generate money. I spend an enormous amount of energy working to get older Linux and Mac games published on Steam. Having a means to fund that work allows me to both work my way through that backlog and take on new projects from small developers that can't pay for a Linux port.</p><p>There are also long-term plans for this Patreon to fund the writing of a book on SDL 2.0 development. This is a desperately-needed effort that will make Linux game development easier for everyone.</p><p>I hope you consider helping me by becoming my patron! I feel that I can do an enormous amount of good here, with your support.</p><p>Thanks,<br>--ryan.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
