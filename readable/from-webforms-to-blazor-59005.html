<p>Tell me if you’ve heard this one before.</p>

<p>A company invests huge amounts of time, money and energy into building an application.</p>

<p>Over time the application gets slower, and slower. Development takes longer, and longer.</p>

<p>“Small” changes ripple through the entire application, causing breaking changes in seemingly random places.</p>

<p>At this point the company realises it’s in a bad place, and decides the only solution is a complete re-write.</p>

<p>Technology has moved on, it will be different this time, we’ll build it properly.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-next">What happens next?</h2>

<p>Now there are two versions of the app.</p>

<p>The old, legacy version (which is actually in use) and the shiny, new version (which is not).</p>

<p>As requirements continue to fly in, the development team end up having to implement them in both versions.</p>

<p>So the developers are split into two teams, one to work on the legacy system, one to work on the new.</p>

<p>Naturally, everyone wants to work on the shiny new version.</p>

<p>If you’re really, really lucky, the rewrite might actually get completed, it may even go live and find its way into the hands of real users.</p>

<p>But then the problems really start, because stuff that worked before is missing; crucial business requirements embedded in the code were overlooked during the rewrite.</p>

<p>Slowly, the new codebase descends into a convoluted mess, development slows down.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s time for another re-write…</p>



<h2 id="complex-reality-complex-code">complex reality = complex code</h2>

<p>The problems here are all too familiar to many of us, but the outcome isn’t surprising; it makes total sense when you stop and think about it.</p>

<p>You see, the complexity in the app wasn’t just because of crap code; it was complex and messy because <strong>the business domain is complex and messy</strong>.</p>

<p>Asking the same development team to rewrite the entire app requires them to understand all the business logic well enough to represent it in code.</p>

<p>Where does that vital business logic exist? In people’s heads, and in the legacy code.</p>

<p>So now the team have a mammoth task ahead of them; they need to read, decipher and magically re-write all of the existing business logic, using a new framework, in a completely different application.</p>

<p>Copying and pasting from old to new gains little, and rewriting crucial logic carries its own risks…</p>

<h2 id="an-alternative-small-refactors">An alternative - small refactors</h2>

<p>So what’s the answer?</p>

<p>Ask a developer who’s been round this hamster wheel a few times and they’ll probably advocate refactoring the code as you go.</p>

<p>“Refactor more” is technically sound, but, in practical terms, vague advice for a team fighting in the trenches every day.</p>

<p>Refactor what?</p>

<p>Refactor how?</p>

<p>Refactoring for the sake of refactoring probably won’t get you anywhere, but refactoring as part of a cohesive strategy just might.</p>

<p>The biggest blocker to introducing new technology into an application (e.g. adopting Blazor instead of WebForms) is nearly always a lack of separation between the UI and the business logic. If it’s not clear where those boundaries are you’re pushing a heavy rock up a very steep hill.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you can find a way to carve off the UI concerns from everything else, you might just stand a chance of putting a new UI framework on top of the existing business logic…</p>

<p>Here’s a typical WebForms example (from a helpdesk system, based on real code, changed just enough to protect the guilty!)</p>

<p><strong>Search.aspx.cs</strong></p>

<pre><code><span><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Search</span>(<span><span>object</span> sender, EventArgs eventArgs</span>)
</span>{
    dvResults.Visible = <span>true</span>;
    rptTickets.Visible = <span>false</span>;
    pnlError.Visible = <span>false</span>;
    pnlNoResults.Visible = <span>false</span>;
    pnlResultsCount.Visible = <span>false</span>;

    SearchTicketsRequest searchRequest = GetSearchRequestFromUI();

    TicketCollectionResponse searchResponse = 
        _helpdeskService.Ticket.SearchTickets(searchRequest);

    <span>if</span> (searchResponse.IsSuccess)
    {
        <span>if</span> (searchResponse.Tickets.Count() &gt; <span>0</span>)
        {
            IOrderedEnumerable&lt;Ticket&gt; orderedTickets = searchResponse.Tickets
                .OrderBy(x =&gt; x.DateCreated);

            GetUserSummaryForTickets(orderedTickets);

            rptTickets.DataSource = orderedTickets;
            rptTickets.DataBind();

            pnlResultsCount.Visible = <span>true</span>;
            rptTickets.Visible = <span>true</span>;
        }
        <span>else</span>
        {
            pnlNoResults.Visible = <span>true</span>;
        }
    }
    <span>else</span>
    {
        pnlError.Visible = <span>true</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now as legacy code goes, this isn’t too bad. If you ran across this in your code base you’d be tempted to leave it alone.</p>

<p>But this code also represents an opportunity; to slowly refactor your way to a different UI framework.</p>

<p>Imagine you’re tasked with switching this one search feature from WebForms to Blazor.</p>

<p>Which bits are WebForms specific, and conversely which bits would you still keep, even with a different UI framework?</p>

<p>In this case all the references to repeaters, labels, panels etc. are very much WebForms concerns and would stay in this WebForms code behind.</p>

<p>Everything else, if consolidated and moved out of the code behind, could be re-used for Blazor, WebForms, MVC or even Web API…</p>

<p>But this begs the question, what’s a good strategy for this refactor?</p>

<p>Personally (and there is no “correct” answer here), I’d take two simple steps for starters.</p>

<ol>
<li>Simplify the structure</li>
<li>Separate UI (presentation) concerns form everything else</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="simplify-the-structure">Simplify the structure</h2>

<p>Structure in this context means classes, <code>if</code> statements, services, managers, repositories…</p>

<p>Structure is a double-edged sword in legacy code.</p>

<p>“Good” structure can help you make sense of the code and figure out what’s going on.</p>

<p>Confusing, unnecessary or over-complicated structure obfuscates more than it clarifies, and makes refactoring a lot harder than it might be.</p>

<p>To that end I’d start by inlining some of the calls here; specifically the two calls to methods within this WebForms codebehind, namely <code>GetSearchRequestFromUI</code> and <code>GetUserSummaryForTickets</code>.</p>

<pre><code><span><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Search</span>(<span><span>object</span> sender, EventArgs eventArgs</span>)
</span>{
    dvResults.Visible = <span>true</span>;
    rptTickets.Visible = <span>false</span>;
    pnlError.Visible = <span>false</span>;
    pnlNoResults.Visible = <span>false</span>;
    pnlResultsCount.Visible = <span>false</span>;

    SearchTicketsRequest searchRequest = <span>new</span> SearchTicketsRequest {
        Term = txtSearch.Text
    };
    TicketCollectionResponse searchResponse = 
        _helpdeskService.Ticket.SearchTickets(searchRequest);

    <span>if</span> (searchResponse.IsSuccess)
    {
        <span>if</span> (searchResponse.Tickets.Count() &gt; <span>0</span>)
        {
            IOrderedEnumerable&lt;Ticket&gt; orderedTickets = 
                searchResponse.Tickets.OrderBy(x =&gt; x.DateCreated);

            <span>foreach</span> (<span>var</span> ticket <span>in</span> orderedTickets)
            {
                ticket.User = _helpdeskService.User.ById(ticket.UserId);
            }

            rptTickets.DataSource = orderedTickets;
            rptTickets.DataBind();

            pnlResultsCount.Visible = <span>true</span>;
            rptTickets.Visible = <span>true</span>;
        }
        <span>else</span>
        {
            pnlNoResults.Visible = <span>true</span>;
        }
    }
    <span>else</span>
    {
        pnlError.Visible = <span>true</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It turns out these methods weren’t hiding too much code in this case, firstly creating a new search request from the value entered by the user.</p>

<pre><code>SearchTicketsRequest searchRequest = <span>new</span> SearchTicketsRequest {
        Term = txtSearch.Text
    };
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, going off to get additional information about the user for each ticket search result.</p>

<pre><code><span>foreach</span> (<span>var</span> ticket <span>in</span> orderedTickets)
{
    ticket.User = _helpdeskService.User.ById(ticket.UserId);
}
</code></pre>

<p>With these inlined, and on the assumption that the other methods are for data retrieval not presentation concerns, we can think about separating the UI from the logic.</p>

<h2 id="separating-presentation-concerns-from-everything-else">Separating presentation concerns from everything else</h2>

<p>What I’m looking for here is the core Request/Response that this code represents.</p>

<p>I find it helps to think of every call made by the presentation layer as being either a query or a command.</p>

<p>In this case, hitting a database to retrieve search results looks an awful lot like a query…</p>

<p>If we consider the request/response for the query it looks like this.</p>

<p><strong>Query Request</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>SearchTerm</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Query Response</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>TicketId</li>
<li>DateCreated</li>
<li>Text</li>
<li>User (DisplayName)</li>
</ul>

<p>I arrived at this definition by exploring the existing WebForms controls, taking each unique piece of information we’re showing in the UI, and representing it in the <strong>Query Response</strong>.</p>

<section>
<h3 id="to-use-existing-code-or-to-not">To use existing code or to not…</h3>

<p>It’s tempting at this point to simply stick with the existing <code>TicketCollectionResponse</code> class.</p>

<p>However, in this case I’ve had a look at the real application this example is based on, and <code>TicketCollectionResponse</code>  is re-used for many different parts of the system.</p>

<p>As often happens in long-lived code it’s been re-used a few too many times and now couples disparate parts of the system together (any changes to <code>TicketCollectionResponse</code> run the risk of rippling through parts of the code we’re not working on).</p>

<p>With this in mind, we’ll create our new, more specific Request/Response representation and let that delegate down to <code>TicketCollectionResponse</code> (for now).</p>

</section>

<p>The plan is to push all the non-presentation code down into our new query, and keep the presentation layer (where we make the request and handle the response) as minimal as possible.</p>

<p><img src="https://jonhilton.net/img/2020-02-21-temp/2020-02-24-21-53-53.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m a big fan of MediatR for representing Request/Response patterns like this, so at this point I’d add MediatR classes to represent this query.</p>

<p><strong>Features/Tickets/Search.cs</strong></p>

<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Search</span>
{
    <span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Query</span> : <span>IRequest</span>&lt;<span>Model</span>&gt;
    {
        <span>public</span> <span>string</span> SearchTerm { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }
    }

    <span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Model</span>
    {
        <span>public</span> <span>bool</span> IsSuccess {<span>get</span>;<span>set</span>;}
        <span>public</span> IEnumerable&lt;SearchResult&gt; Results {<span>get</span>;<span>set</span>;}
        
        <span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SearchResult</span> {
            <span>public</span> Guid TicketId { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }
        	<span>public</span> <span>string</span> Text { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }
        	<span>public</span> DateTime DateCreated { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }
        	<span>public</span> <span>string</span> UserDisplayName { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }
        } 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can create a handler which will run when we invoke this query,</p>

<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>QueryHandler</span> : <span>IRequestHandler</span>&lt;<span>Query</span>, <span>Model</span>&gt;
{
    <span><span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task&lt;Model&gt; <span>Handle</span>(<span>Query request, CancellationToken cancellationToken</span>)
    </span>{
        <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> NotImplementedException();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We’re finally ready to move all the non-presentation code into this handler.</p>

<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>QueryHandler</span> : <span>IRequestHandler</span>&lt;<span>Query</span>, <span>Model</span>&gt;
{
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> HelpdeskService _helpdeskService;

    <span><span>public</span> <span>QueryHandler</span>(<span>HelpdeskService helpdeskService</span>)
    </span>{
        _helpdeskService = helpdeskService;
    }

    <span><span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task&lt;Model&gt; <span>Handle</span>(<span>Query request, CancellationToken cancellationToken</span>)
    </span>{
        SearchTicketsRequest searchRequest = <span>new</span> SearchTicketsRequest 
        {
            Term = request.SearchTerm
        };
        
        TicketCollectionResponse searchResponse = 
            _helpdeskService.Ticket.SearchTickets(searchRequest);
        
        IOrderedEnumerable&lt;Ticket&gt; orderedTickets = 
            searchResponse.Tickets.OrderBy(x =&gt; x.DateCreated);

        <span>var</span> results = orderedTickets.Select(x =&gt; <span>new</span> Model.SearchResult
        {
            Text = x.Text,
            DateCreated = x.DateCreated,
            TicketId = x.Id,
            UserDisplayName = _helpdeskService.User.ById(x.UserId)?.DisplayName
        });

        <span>return</span> <span>new</span> Model
        {
            IsSuccess = <span>true</span>,
            Results = results
        };
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is everything but the WebForms specific presentation logic, which stays put in the WebForms code-behind.</p>

<p><strong>Search.aspx.cs</strong></p>

<pre><code><span><span>public</span> <span>async</span> <span>void</span> <span>Search</span>(<span><span>object</span> sender, EventArgs eventArgs</span>)
</span>{
    dvResults.Visible = <span>true</span>;
    rptTickets.Visible = <span>false</span>;
    pnlError.Visible = <span>false</span>;
    pnlNoResults.Visible = <span>false</span>;
    pnlResultsCount.Visible = <span>false</span>;

    <span>var</span> model = <span>await</span> _mediator.Send(<span>new</span> Search.Query {
        SearchTerm = txtSearch.Text
    });

    <span>if</span> (model.IsSuccess)
    {
        <span>if</span> (model.Results.Any())
        {
            rptTickets.DataSource = model.Results;
            rptTickets.DataBind();

            pnlResultsCount.Visible = <span>true</span>;
            rptTickets.Visible = <span>true</span>;
        }
        <span>else</span>
        {
            pnlNoResults.Visible = <span>true</span>;
        }
    }
    <span>else</span>
    {
        pnlError.Visible = <span>true</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One of the big benefits of adopting MediatR lies in how it declutters your presentation layer.</p>

<p>This WebForms code no longer needs to know about <code>HelpDeskService</code>, <code>TicketService</code>, <code>UserService</code> etc. instead relying on the single <code>IMediator</code> dependency.</p>

<p>When we call <code>_mediator</code> and pass an instance of <code>Search.Query</code> we get a <code>Search.Model</code> response.</p>

<p>Everything we need to drive the UI is contained within that response.</p>

<p><img src="https://jonhilton.net/img/2020-02-21-temp/2020-02-24-22-24-16.png" alt=""></p>

<p>From here we’re free to further refactor the code in <code>QueryHandler</code>, confident that the presentation code doesn’t rely on any implementation details (e.g. <code>TicketService</code>).</p>

<p>We also have a much clearer path to switch UI framework; Blazor could easily make this exact same Mediator call and handle the response.</p>
