<h2 id="introducing-the-editor">Introducing the Editor</h2>
<p>Collaborative editors are defined by the size and speed of their
updates. On a website you might submit a form, but in a collaborative
editor you can send a single character or key press.</p>

<p>Those tiny edits are shared quickly so you feel connected to your
collaborators and can anticipate their actions. This experience is
described as <em>real-time</em> editing.</p>
<p>Inside your editor, however, the frequent edits form a hotbed of
conflicting updates. Solving or avoiding these conflicts is the real
challenge of a collaborative text editor.</p>
<h2 id="conflicts">Conflicts</h2>
<p>Taking turns, two authors might avoid a conflict - if they have the
patience.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/4154d7b675ec700e00.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But our collaborative editor has many authors. To block one author's
key press until another releases their keyboard would be infuriating.
Instead, they each edit a copy of the document and submit changes
when ready.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/57a61b3a6fefc58700.png" title="Their legs are crossed. That's probably not obvious."></p>
<p>To submit, the first author can simply swap his copy for the
original - with no prior updates, his edits apply cleanly.</p>
<p>The second author, however, will find - in place of the original - the
first author's copy. Where she re-worded a sentence, he might have
deleted the whole paragraph. She cannot replace the document without
losing his work, so she must compare the two and decide how, and if,
her edits still apply.</p>
<p>Most collaborative editors do this automatically, behind the scenes,
for every change to a document.</p>
<h2 id="operational-transformation">Operational Transformation</h2>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d16f9e7203a8563100.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The process of re-writing your edits to account for the work of others
is called <em>Operational Transformation</em>. It's the most popular way to
implement a collaborative editor and is used by Etherpad and Google
Docs.</p>
<p>Concrete examples will follow, but for now let's start with two
tubes: the kind you buy tennis balls in.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/155936b3bca3740700.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Each tube has a starting state - a yellow ball - and each is held by a
different artist. At the same time, each artist adds a coloured ball
to the tube and informs their partner.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d4d34a8e9cee60a400.png" alt="Two tubes, the left showing a yellow ball and a blue ball stacked on top, the right showing a red ball in place of blue. Beside the tubes are two artists saying 'blue' and 'red' respectively." title="We're not acorns, we're artists."></p>
<p>If they apply their partner's update naively, their tubes will look
different: red-blue-yellow one side and blue-red-yellow the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f4f128e9fa2cfce00.png" alt="Two tubes, the left showing from top to bottom: red, blue, yellow, the right: blue, red, yellow."></p>
<p>No single tube is correct - the colours were added simultaneously -
but the artists should agree a result.</p>
<p>To resolve the tie, they can invent an arbitrary rule. One that, when
applied by both artists, will arrive at the same state.
They could discard every ballâ€¦ but the result is disappointing. How
about: "when inserts are tied, insert red before blue"?</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/74a0a8e0c99fd7b500.png" alt="Two tubes, both showing from top to bottom: blue, red, yellow."></p>
<p>By applying the same rule their states <em>converge</em>. This is the
principle behind Operational Transformation and it can be applied to
many authors typing at once.</p>
<h2 id="handling-text">Handling text</h2>
<p>In a text document, you can improve such a rule by examining the
position of the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/9ae873262f52072300.jpg" alt="Tama under a blanket with the caption 'sleepy cat'." title="Mraow"></p>
<p>Here's a photo of our cat Tama. I've labelled it "sleepy cat".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f664db5aa88a35300.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;very sleepy cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;sleepy grumpy cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama and Yui (our other cat) both update my caption at different
positions. When Tama receives Yui's edit, she'll need to
shift Yui's "grumpy" right to account for her insert of "very".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/f7a6a5a6edbee75500.png" alt="Two editors with the same state: very sleepy grumpy cat. Tama has applied the transformed message 'INS &quot;grumpy &quot; 12'."></p>
<p>If she applied Yui's edit at its original character position, Tama
would have the state <strong>"very slgrumpy eepy cat"</strong>. But by understanding
how their concurrent edits affect one another, Tama's editor can
recover.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can't rely on position alone - what if they both
insert text at the same location?</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d56daf5a9e4e722f00.jpg" alt="Tama on top of the blanket with the caption &quot;Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Another photo, labelled simply: "Tama".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/086ae591d859549800.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;happy Tama&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama and Yui both make an edit at the beginning - position 0.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/819f09cfa16942c400.png" alt="Two editors showing a conflict. Tama has applied 'INS &quot;playful &quot; 0' and has the state &quot;playful happy Tama&quot;. Yui has applied 'INS &quot;happy &quot; 0' and has the state &quot;happy playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Like our artists, Tama and Yui are tied for position. To resolve this,
we invent another arbitrary rule and order the inserts by Tama and
Yui's <em>editor ID</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/8c2ab5057501f00500.png" alt="Two editors with the conflict resolved. Tama has applied the transformed message 'INS &quot;playful &quot; 6' and now also has the state &quot;happy playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Yui has ID <code>[2]</code>, which is greater than Tama's <code>[1]</code>, so Tama
shifts Yui's insert after her own to converge on: <strong>"happy
playful Tama"</strong>.</p>
<p>We applied only two concurrent edits, but if Tama made multiple
changes, she would need to transform Yui's insert for each -
potentially shifting it multiple times before its final position.</p>
<p>I hope you feel confident after that, because - to demonstrate the
risks - I'm going to present a puzzle that threw the early algorithms
off-course.</p>
<h2 id="false-ties">False ties</h2>
<p><img alt="A photo of Yui with the caption 'little cat'." src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/750197ed186d7d3c00.jpg" title="Ah yes, all innocent - you wouldn't believe the noise."></p>
<p>The puzzle begins with a third author. And, since we only have two
cats - that's Yui above - I've introduced a fictional bunny: Bandit.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/f57d6afe96060d5d00.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;little loud cat&quot;. Bandit suggesting &quot;cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;cute little cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Bandit doesn't think Yui is small and deletes the word 'little'. After
applying all their edits, we expect the final caption to read: "cute
loud cat".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/8bd6291f807f45ce00.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But there's a problem - because Bandit deletes the word separating
Tama and Yui's edits, a transform step might (falsely) tie them for
position. I'll demonstrate by stepping through Tama and Bandit's
transforms.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d1431eaff0d5f1a600.png" alt="Tama applying 'INS &quot;loud &quot; 7', 'INS &quot;cute &quot; 0', and the transformed message 'DEL 5..12' to get the state &quot;cute loud cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama arrives at the correct result <strong>"cute loud cat"</strong> because she
applies Bandit's delete <em>after</em> her and Yui's inserts. Bandit,
however, applies his delete first.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/09c1793a9bf57cd800.png" alt="Bandit applying 'DEL 0..7', the transformed message 'INS &quot;loud &quot; 0', and the transformed message 'INS &quot;cute &quot; 0' to get the state &quot;loud cute cat&quot;."></p>
<p>His delete shifts Tama's "loud" to position 0. Yui's edit now ties
with Tama's, so Bandit must apply the arbitrary rule and order their
inserts by editor ID - <code>[1]</code> Tama's "loud", followed by <code>[2]</code> Yui's
"cute". Bandit incorrectly arrives at <strong>"loud cute cat"</strong>.</p>
<p>If you didn't anticipate that you're in good company. Many academic
papers on Operational Transformation (OT) suffered similar
<em>counter-examples</em> (or bugs, to the practitioner) on publication.
Thankfully these puzzles have now been solved, as evidenced by the
widespread use of OT in the wild.</p>
<p>You can find the solution to our puzzle in the 30 years of OT research
since 1989. But to keep your curiosity in check, consider the
following: if an edit could be <em>undone</em>, conflicts could be rewound
and replayed in a fixed order. It's more work, and could still cause a
false tie, but at least everyone would encounter the <em>same</em> tie.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're now suitably paranoid. Operational Transformation is
easy to explain but complex to implement. If only there was a way to
avoid conflicts altogetherâ€¦</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-conflicts">Avoiding conflicts</h2>
<p>Remember the two artists? I have another commission for them, this
time using coloured liquid instead of balls.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7039688af6d8494800.png" title="There are plenty of yellow liquids."></p>
<p>They each start with a tube containing yellow dye, to which they add
their own colours. Yellow and blue to make green; yellow and red to make
orange.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/48d447c836121b4600.png" alt="A blue drop being added to the left tube to make green. A red drop being added to the right tube to make orange."></p>
<p>Finally, they inform each other and add their partner's dye to their
own.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/35549bbf749c16a000.png" alt="A red drop being added to the left tube to make a sort of grey colour. A blue drop added to the right tube to make the same grew colour."></p>
<p>What a lovely colour! - but at least they didn't have to apply any
transforms to converge on it. Because the artists used liquid,
the order they added the dye is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Using a data type with the same property for text we could eliminate
conflicts there too.</p>
<h2 id="conflict-free-replicated-data-types">Conflict-free replicated data types</h2>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f664db5aa88a35300.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;very sleepy cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;sleepy grumpy cat&quot;."></p>
<p>One elegant data type, called LOGOOT (an example of a conflict-free
replicated data type, or CRDT) is built upon each edit holding a
unique position - represented by a list of integers.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/1a9e80211f2fe7f900.png" alt="&quot;[10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>The list is comprised of: a positioning number, the author's editor
ID, and a counter.</p>
<p>Every edit increments the author's counter. In combination with their
editor ID, it ensures the position is unique. The positioning number
places the text in the document.</p>
<p>To insert a word at the beginning of the document (before "sleepy")
Tama <code>[1]</code> would create a new position list that starts with a random
value between 0 and 10.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/db8ec7b35046ae4700.png" alt="&quot;[6, 1, 1] VERY, [10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>Yui <code>[2]</code>, unable to generate an integer between 10 and 11, chooses a
new random positioning number and appends her values to the preceding
list. By growing the list, Yui can always find a position between two
adjacent words.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/e74bdd81e27aab8200.png" alt="&quot;[6, 1, 1] VERY, [10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [10, 0, 1, 130, 2, 1] GRUMPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>You can insert these four words - ordered by their position lists - in
any sequence. You'll always arrive at the same result.</p>
<p>The example above uses a position list per word, but you'll probably
want a position list per <em>character</em> - occupying significantly more
space than the text alone in exchange for predictable performance.</p>
<p>Praise for the performance of CRDTs often rests on the worst-case
scenario: a long conflicting history of edits. In practice,
Operational Transformation can perform millions of simple transforms a
second and grants greater freedom to optimise the data structure - so
you might find OT performs better where fast feedback and short
conflicting histories are the norm.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy using a modified version of LOGOOT. In the end,
what convinced me was, not performance, but greater confidence that my
code is correct.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2>
<p>It seems incredible that, after 30 years of research, many products
still restrict work to a single author or just lose overlapping edits.
If, instead, we apply techniques to detect, avoid, and resolve
conflicts, we <em>can</em> write good collaborative software.</p>
