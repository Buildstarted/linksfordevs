  <p dir="false" data-test-bidi="">There is a subtle beauty to Florence. This poignant love story intertwines a succinct narrative with smart interaction design to create moments of surprising emotional weight. Conversations are turned into puzzles that evolve as the characters’ moods shift. Memories fade into focus like old Polaroid photos. The way you touch the screen becomes just as important as the plot, which makes for a story you want to steer as well as follow. Florence fosters a rare sense of intimacy with its characters, creating an impression that lingers long after the story ends. </p>

      <div dir="false" data-test-bidi=""><p>Right off the bat, Florence captivated me with its art style and somber music. The story is nothing new, but Annapurna Interactive manages to mesh in the right music, character development, and pacing to create a compelling and believable story. </p><p>I imagine there will be lots of people who will identify with Florence- those who have been working meaningless full time jobs that make them feel hollow and unfulfilled. To those, Florence speaks that it is worth taking a step back to consider pursuing your dreams and passions- it is never too late. </p><p>To those expecting a happily ever after ending, Florence affirms our understanding that despite our best wishes and intents, life doesn’t always go the way that we want it too. People come into our lives, and sometimes they go. But Florence teaches us to not let those experiences tear us down. In having new people come into our lives, we learn new things about them and about ourselves. Meeting new people is an essential part of self discovery that allows us to harness what we learn about ourselves and use that knowledge to shape a happier and better future.</p></div>

</h3>

  <blockquote id="ember103284044">      

      <div dir="false" data-test-bidi=""><p>I was really impressed by how they told such a compelling engaging story in this medium- relying primarily on interactive visuals. It was such creative visual storytelling and a joy to experience this whole arc in florence's life. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The story's format and the tools they used to tell it was really impressive to me because of the skillfulness and partially because it's a novel format. Apps that tell stories artistically are fairly new to me, and fairly new in general! This app did a wonderful job. it seems like a really lovely way to explore a character-focused piece, which I love. it takes creativity to devise methods of communicating the highs and lows in such a clear and precise way... I loved it and thanks to the people who worked on it :-) </p><p>To everyone else: I definitely recommend giving it a shot and supporting it if you can. the story itself explores heartbreak but is also very encouraging. 🌱🌿 The music and art and interactive elements all throughout worked together so beautifully.</p></div>
