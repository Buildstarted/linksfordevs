It would suffice to have the vector be given the size of each item at run-time.</p><p>I am aware of possible workarounds, but these tend not to reflect the underlying idea of the algorithm, which is always a bad thing with regards to maintainance. Are there classes which provide such a convenience and work as efficient as one might expect?</p><p>EDIT:</p><p>This is not about item sizes varying throughout the array. It has <em>nothing</em> to do with that. It is at run-time deciding how large the items in the array are; i.e. a (very) weak form of dynamic typing, in contrast to static typing as used with templates.</p><p>Hence the initialization of the object should look like that:</p><pre><code>DynamicVector V( lengthofvector, sizeofelement );
</code></pre><p>An application are simplicial meshes. The object $V$ contains items of fixed size or "type", each consisting of integers for the topological information and doubles for some geometric information. There might even come booleans into play, but this is irrelevant so far.</p></div></div></div></div>
