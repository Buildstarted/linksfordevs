<div><div><div><p>Red-blue contrast was used in a portrait of Goethe</p></div></div></div>
<p>Over two centuries ago, the effect of color depth perception was first noted by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe" title="Goethe">Goethe</a> in his Farbenlehre (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Colours" title="Theory of Colours">Theory of Colours</a>) in which he recognized blue as a receding color and yellow/red as a protruding color. He argued that, "like we see the high sky, the far away mountains, as blue, in the same way a blue field seems to recede…(also) One can stare at a perfectly yellow/red field, then the color seems to pierce into the organ".<sup id="cite_ref-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante-9">[9]</a></sup> This phenomenon, now referred to as chromostereopsis, or the stereoptic effect, explains the visual science behind this color depth effect, and has many implications for art, media, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, as well as our daily lives in how we perceive colors and objects.
</p><p>Although Goethe did not propose any scientific reasoning behind his observations, in the late 1860s Bruecke and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscus_Donders" title="Franciscus Donders">Donders</a> first suggested that the chromostereoptic effect was due to accommodative awareness, given that ocular <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics" title="Optics">optics</a> are not <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey" title="Grey">achromatic</a> and red objects require more accommodation to be focused on the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina" title="Retina">retina</a>. This notion of accommodation could then be translated into perception of distance. However, what Donders and Bruecke originally missed in their theory is the necessity of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision" title="Binocular vision">binocular</a> observation to produce chromostereopsis. Later, veering off from accommodative awareness, Bruecke proposed that chromatic aberration, along with the temporal off-axis effect of the pupil, can explain the chromostereoptic effect. It is this hypothesis that still forms the basis for our present day understanding of chromostereopsis.<sup id="cite_ref-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante_9-1"><a href="#cite_note-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante-9">[9]</a></sup></p><p>Over the years, art analysis has provided ample evidence of the chromostereoptic effect, but until about thirty years ago little was known about the neurological, anatomical and/or physiological explanation behind the phenomena. For example, in 1958 Dutch art historian De Wilde noted that in analyzing <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubist" title="Cubist">cubist</a> painter <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Gestel" title="Leo Gestel">Leo Gestel</a>'s painting "The Poet Rensburg", instead of using conventional graded depth cues, "If you put violet next to yellow or green next to orange, the violet and the green retreat. In general, the warm colours come forward, and the cool colours retreat".<sup id="cite_ref-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante_9-2"><a href="#cite_note-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante-9">[9]</a></sup> In this sense, the chromostereoptic effect gives shapes plasticity and allows for depth perception through color manipulation.

<div><div><div><p>Schematic diagram of the human eye</p></div></div></div>
<p>The binocular nature of the chromostereopsis was discovered by Bruecke and arises due to the position of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis" title="Fovea centralis">fovea</a> relative to the optical axis. The fovea is located temporally to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_axis" title="Optical axis">optical axis</a> and as a result, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_axis" title="Visual axis">visual axis</a> passes through the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea" title="Cornea">cornea</a> with a nasal <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_eccentricity" title="Horizontal eccentricity">horizontal eccentricity</a>, meaning that the average ray bound for the fovea must undergo <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersive_prism" title="Dispersive prism">prismatic</a> deviation and is thus subject to chromatic <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)" title="Dispersion (optics)">dispersion</a>. The prismatic deviation is in opposite directions in each eye, resulting in opposite color shifts that lead to a shift in stereoptic depth between red and blue objects. The eccentric foveal receptive system, along with the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiles-Crawford_effect" title="Stiles-Crawford effect">Stiles-Crawford effect</a>, work in opposite directions of one another and roughly cancel out, offering another explanation to why subjects may show color stereoscopy "against the rule" (a reversal of the expected results).<sup id="cite_ref-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante_9-3"><a href="#cite_note-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante-9">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>Evidence for the stereoptic effect is often quite easy to see. For example, when red and blue are viewed side by side on a dark surrounding, most people will view the red as "floating" in front of the blue. However, this is not true for everyone, as some people see the opposite and others no effect at all. This is the same effect that both <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe" title="Goethe">Goethe</a> and De Wilde had indicated in their observations. While a majority of people will view red as "floating" in front of blue, others experience a reversal of the effect in which they see blue floating in front of the red, or no depth effect at all. While this reversal may appear to discredit chromostereopsis, it does not and instead, as originally proposed by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einthoven" title="Einthoven">Einthoven</a>, can be explained by an increase in the effect and subsequent reversal via blocking of the eccentric position of the pupil with respect to the optical axis.<sup id="cite_ref-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante_9-4"><a href="#cite_note-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante-9">[9]</a></sup>
The diverse nature of the chromostereoptic effect is because the color depth effect is closely intertwined with both perceptual and optical factors. In other words, neither the optical nor the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual" title="Perceptual">perceptual</a> factors can be taken in insolation to explain chromostereopsis. This multifactorial component of chromostereopsis offers one explanation of the reversal of the effect in different people given the same visual cues.<sup id="cite_ref-Faubert_1995_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Faubert_1995-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<div><div><div><p>Reversal effect due to white background</p></div></div></div>
<p>Another interesting reversal effect was observed in 1928 by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verhoeff" title="Verhoeff">Verhoeff</a> in which the red bars were perceived as farther away and the blue bars as protruding when the bars are paired on a white background instead of a black background. Verhoeff proposed that this paradoxical reversal can be understood in terms of the pupil's <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance" title="Luminance">luminance</a> contours (see: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_Contours" title="Illusory Contours">Illusory Contours</a>). The pupil has lines of constant luminance efficiency, with each subsequent line marking a 25% decrease in efficiency. Around 1998, Winn and co-workers confirmed Verhoeff's interpretation of this reversal using experiments on different colored backgrounds.<sup id="cite_ref-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante_9-5"><a href="#cite_note-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante-9">[9]</a></sup> Other research has also suggested that border contrast changes could lead to color depth reversal with the switch from black to white backgrounds.<sup id="cite_ref-Faubert_1995_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-Faubert_1995-2">[2]</a></sup></p><p>In 1933, Stiles and Crawford discovered that the light <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)" title="Stimulus (physiology)">sensitivity</a> of the fovea differs significantly for rays entering the eye through the center of the pupil versus rays entering from its <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral" title="Peripheral">peripheral</a> regions. They observed that the usual "intensity multiplied by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture" title="Aperture">aperture</a>" rule did not apply in foveal vision and that rays entering the eye via peripheral regions of the pupil were less efficient by roughly a factor of five. This effect is now known as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiles-Crawford_effect" title="Stiles-Crawford effect">Stiles-Crawford effect</a> and also has implications for the reverse chromostereoptic effect.<sup id="cite_ref-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante_9-6"><a href="#cite_note-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante-9">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1885, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einthoven" title="Einthoven">Einthoven</a> proposed a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory" title="Theory">theory</a> which states: "The phenomenon (chromostereopsis) is due to chromatic difference of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification" title="Magnification">magnification</a>, for since, for example, blue rays are refracted more than red rays by the ocular media, their foci not only lie at different levels (chromatic aberration) but make different angles with the optic axis, and will thus stimulate disparate points. It follows that individuals with temporally eccentric <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupils" title="Pupils">pupils</a> see red in front of blue, while with nasally <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(geometry)" title="Centre (geometry)">eccentric</a> pupils the relief is reversed."<sup id="cite_ref-Thompson_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-Thompson-10">[10]</a></sup> Einthoven first explained chromatic aberration in the eye, which means that the eyes will not <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(cognitive_process)" title="Focus (cognitive process)">focus</a> all the colors at the same time. Depending on the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength" title="Wavelength">wavelength</a>, the focal point in the eyes varies. He concluded that the reason why people see red in front of blue is because light with different wavelengths project onto different parts of the retina. When the vision is binocular, a disparity is created, which causes depth perception. Since red is focused temporally, it appears to be in front. However, under monocular vision, this phenomenon is not observed.<sup id="cite_ref-Thompson_10-1"><a href="#cite_note-Thompson-10">[10]</a></sup></p><p>However, Bruecke objected to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einthoven" title="Einthoven">Einthoven</a>'s theory on grounds that not all people see red as closer than blue. Einthoven explained that this negative chromostereopsis is probably due to eccentrically positioned pupils because shifting the pupil can change the position of where light wavelengths focus in the eye. Negative chromostereopsis was further studied by Allen and Rubin who suggested that changing the angle between the pupillary center and visual axis can change the direction of chromostereopsis. If the pupillary center is located temporal to the visual axis, red will appear closer. The reverse effect is observed when the pupillary center is nasal to the visual axis.<sup id="cite_ref-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante_9-7"><a href="#cite_note-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante-9">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>Recent research has attempted to extend the basis for the traditional chromostereoptic theory, including work done by Stiles and Crawford. In 1933, Stiles and Crawford accidentally discovered that the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_sensitivity" title="Light sensitivity">light sensitivity</a> differed for rays entering through center versus those entering from <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral" title="Peripheral">peripheral</a> regions of the eye. The efficiency of the rays is less when the rays enter via the peripheral region because the shape of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cells" title="Cone cells">cone cells</a> that collect the incident quanta are different from cone receptors in the center of the eye. This effect can cause both positive and negative chromostereopsis depending on the position of the pupil. If the pupil is centered on optical axis, it causes positive chromostereopsis. However, if the pupil is significantly off-center from the optical axis, negative chromostereopsis will ensue. Because most people have a point of maximum luminous efficiency that is off-center, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiles-Crawford_effect" title="Stiles-Crawford effect">Stiles-Crawford Effects</a> generally will have <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/antagonistic" title="wikt:antagonistic">antagonistic</a> chromostereoptic effects. Therefore, instead of seeing red in front of blue, blue will be seen in front of red and the effect will be reversed. The Stiles-Crawford effect also explains why positive chromostereopsis is decreased when illumination is lowered. At lower illumination, the dilation of pupil increases the pupillary peripheral region and therefore increases the magnitude of the Stiles-Crawford effect.<sup id="cite_ref-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante_9-8"><a href="#cite_note-Depth_in_colour,_a_history_of_a_chapter_in_physiologie_optique_amusante-9">[9]</a></sup></p>

Because the indices of refraction (see: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_Index" title="Refractive Index">Refractive Index</a>) vary inversely with wavelength, blue rays (short wavelength) will be refracted more than red rays (long wavelength).

By <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_Law" title="Snell's Law">Snell's Law</a> of Refraction, this <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence_(optics)" title="Angle of incidence (optics)">incidence angle</a> subsequently determines the amount of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_dispersion" title="Chromatic dispersion">chromatic dispersion</a> and thus location of the retinal images for different wavelengths of light.<sup id="cite_ref-Thibos_1989_11-4"><a href="#cite_note-Thibos_1989-11">[11]</a></sup> In TCA, different wavelengths of light are displaced in non-corresponding retinal positions of each eye during binocular viewing. The chromostereoptic effect is generally attributed to the interocular difference in TCA. Color-induced depth effects due to TCA can only be perceived in images containing achromatic information and a single non-achromatic color.<sup id="cite_ref-Faubert_1995_2-4"><a href="#cite_note-Faubert_1995-2">[2]</a></sup> The amplitude of the perceived depth in an image due to the stereoptic effect can be predicted from the amount of induced TCA. In other words, as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupillary_distance" title="Pupillary distance">pupillary distance</a> from the foveal achromatic axis is increased, perceived depth also increases.

<p>Longitudinal and transverse chromatic aberrations work together to affect retinal image quality. Additionally, pupil displacement from the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_axis" title="Visual axis">visual axis</a> is critical for determining the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)" title="Magnitude (mathematics)">magnitude</a> of the aberration under natural viewing conditions.<sup id="cite_ref-Thibos_1989_11-5"><a href="#cite_note-Thibos_1989-11">[11]</a></sup> In chromostereopsis, if the pupils of the two eyes are displaced temporally from the visual axis, then blue rays from a point source will intersect the retinae on the nasal side of red rays from the same source. This induced ocular disparity makes blue rays appear to come from a more distant source than red rays.

<p>Many different methods of testing have been employed to view the effects of chromostereopsis on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception" title="Depth perception">depth perception</a> in humans. Technological progress has allowed for accurate, efficient, and more conclusive testing, in relation to the past, where individuals would merely observe the occurrence.
</p><p>In one method, twenty-five control subjects were tested using color-based depth effects through the use of five different colored pairs of squares. The different colors were blue, red, green, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyan" title="Cyan">cyan</a> and yellow. Subjects were placed in a dark room and the colored square <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)" title="Stimulus (physiology)">stimuli</a> were presented for 400 <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milliseconds" title="Milliseconds">milliseconds</a> each, and during this time the subjects were asked to attend to either the right or left square (evenly counterbalanced across subjects). Using a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystick" title="Joystick">joystick</a>, the subject indicated whether the square was behind, in front of, or in the same plane as its pair. According to the theory, the longer the wavelength of the color, the closer it should be perceived by the observer for positive chromostereopsis. Having a longer wavelength than the other colors, red should appear closest. To enhance this effect, subjects put on blazed-grating ChromaDepthTM <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses" title="Glasses">glasses</a>, which contain a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(optics)" title="Prism (optics)">prism</a> structure to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refract" title="Refract">refract</a> the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light" title="Light">light</a> to an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle" title="Angle">angle</a> of approximately 1° and were tested again.<sup id="cite_ref-pmid19442677_13-0"><a href="#cite_note-pmid19442677-13">[13]</a></sup></p><p>The use of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodes" title="Electrodes">electrodes</a> to test <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain" title="Brain">brain</a> activity is another, relatively new way to test for chromostereopsis.

The direction of chromostereopsis can be reversed by moving both artificial pupils in a nasal direction or temporal direction with respect to the centers of the natural pupils.

This is because moving the pupil changes the position of the optic axis, but not the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_axis" title="Visual axis">visual axis</a>, thus changing the sign of transverse chromatic aberration.

<p>While a lot of physiological mechanisms that cause chromostereopsis have been discovered and researched, there are still unanswered questions. For example, many researchers believe that chromostereopsis is caused by combination of multiple factors. Because of this, some of the more recent research has attempted to investigate how the different <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminescence" title="Luminescence">luminescence</a> of backgrounds and different luminescence of red and blue color affect the chromostereoptic effect.<sup id="cite_ref-Thompson_10-2"><a href="#cite_note-Thompson-10">[10]</a></sup></p><p>Additionally, previous studies have taken a psychophysical approach to studying chromostereopsis in order to document it as a perceptual effect and observe its optic mechanisms. However, until recently, no studies had examined the neurophysiological basis of chromostereopsis.<sup id="cite_ref-pmid19442677_13-2"><a href="#cite_note-pmid19442677-13">[13]</a></sup></p><p>The most recent neurophysiological study by Cauquil et al. describes V1 and V2 color-preferring cells as coding local image characteristics (such as binocular disparity) and surface properties of a 3D scene, respectively. The study conducted by Cauquil et al. indicates, based on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode" title="Electrode">electrode</a> stimulation results, that both <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_(anatomy)" title="Dorsal (anatomy)">dorsal</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral" title="Ventral">ventral</a> pathways in the brain are involved in chromostereoptic processing. This study also concluded that chromostereopsis starts in the early stages of visual <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex" title="Visual cortex">cortical</a> processing, first in the occipito-<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal-temporal-occipital" title="Parietal-temporal-occipital">parietal</a> region of the brain, followed by a second step in the right parietal area and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe" title="Temporal lobe">temporal</a> lobes. Additionally, activity was found to be greater in the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_hemisphere" title="Right hemisphere">right hemisphere</a>, which is dominant for 3D cortical processing, indicating that chromostereopsis is a task-dependent, top-down effect.
