You can access all of the content from <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, for example, but Apple is only highlighting a selection of general interest news stories, and to find anything else, you have to search. â€ŒApple Newsâ€Œ+ also only retains three days of archived content.

Newspapers have refused to join because Apple takes 50 percent of the revenue from an â€ŒApple Newsâ€Œ+ subscription, splitting the rest between publishers based on how much time is spent on their content.
</p><center><twitter-widget id="twitter-widget-0" data-tweet-id="1121063750239387649"></twitter-widget> </center> <p>Former Texture users have also expressed displeasure with â€ŒApple Newsâ€Œ+ because the interface is not as streamlined or as easy to use as Texture, there's no Android app, and there's a limited collection of back issues. Texture is shutting down at the end of May.
