<p>
Recently, I have obtained new results [<a href="#kuz-final">1</a>] about the S-box used
by both Russian standards in symmetric cryptography, namely the block
cipher (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznyechik">Kuznyechik</a>) and the hash function (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streebog">Streebog</a>). They are both
GOST standards and RFCs, (respectively <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6986">RFC 6986</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7801">RFC 7801</a>). In this
page, I summarize these latest results using an FAQ. I encourage the
interested reader to have a look at the actual research paper, which
is available online (without any paywall!) on the <a href="https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/7405">ToSC website</a>.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span>1</span> General Context</h2>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1">
<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span>1.1</span> What is symmetric cryptography?</h3>
<div id="text-1-1">
<p>
Cryptography is the science dealing with information security: how can
we communicate in such a way that an eavesdropper cannot spy on us? As
communications are done via computers, the techniques enabling such
protections are algorithms that prevent attackers from accessing the
information without using a <b>key</b>: unless the key is known, it is
impossible to read/modify the data. When the same key is used to
process the information before sending and after receiving, we talk
about <b>symmetric cryptography</b>.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to continuously analyse these algorithms as they may
eventually turn out to have flaws. This threat is not theoretical as
cryptographic algorithms have failed in this way in the past. To take
a recent example, the hash function <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</a> was found to yield
collisions, a critical failure for such an algorithm [<a href="#sha1">4</a>].
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span>1.2</span> How are the cryptographic algorithms that we use chosen?</h3>
<div id="text-1-2">
<p>
The algorithms that are used are usually those that have been
standardized by some standardizing body (e.g. the American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST">NIST</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization">ISO/IEC</a>, etc.). Each standardizing body has its own internal process for
choosing ciphers.
</p>

<p>
This process can be completely opaque as evidenced by the
standardization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG">DUAL_EC</a> PRNG by the American NIST. This
algorithm turned out to have been imposed by the NSA and to likely
contain a backdoor, as detailed in [<a href="#DUAL_EC">8</a>]. In this case, the
algorithm was standardized basically because the NSA said it had to
be. This is not a unique instance: the Russian algorithms discussed on
this page were also designed secretly and then standardized without
any competition or other forms of transparency. It is obviously very
difficult to trust algorithms standardized in this fashion: where is
the third party analysis? Where are the designers' explanations?
</p>

<p>
In order to foster trust, a much better strategy consists in
organizing open competitions. For instance the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard_process">AES</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_hash_function_competition">hash function</a>
NIST competitions yielded the standardization of algorithms that are
now well trusted. This trust comes from the analysis received by these
algorithms before they were standardized and from the quality of the
theoretical frameworks used to construct them, frameworks which were
carefully explained by their designers.
</p>

<p>
The AES, SHA-3 and the DUAL_ EC algorithms were all standardized by
the same institution (the NIST), suggesting that assessing the quality
of a standard is not as simple as looking at its origin.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span>1.3</span> What Are Streebog and Kuznyechik?</h3>
<div id="text-1-3">
<p>
Streebog is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash function</a>. It was standardized by
the Russian Federation in 2012. Kuznyechik is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher">block cipher</a> which
was standardized by the same country in 2015.
</p>

<p>
Both are intended to be used in Russia. At the time of this writing,
their authors are also pushing for their standardization by ISO/IEC.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4">
<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span>1.4</span> What is an S-Box?</h3>
<div id="text-1-4">
<p>
One of the basic building block to construct symmetric algorithms is
the block cipher. For example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>, one of the most widely used and
well studied symmetric cryptographic algorithms, is a block cipher. So
is Kuznyechik. It is also common to use a block cipher to construct a
hash function using a block cipher: it is the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-2</a>, a very
common hash function, and of Streebog.
</p>

<p>
Block ciphers are built by iterating a so-called <i>round function</i>
whose goal is to provide a weak version of the properties that the
block cipher is expected to fulfil. By iterating these rounds, the
properties of their composition gets stronger, and after sufficiently
many rounds it provides these properties in full. A key
property is <i>non-linearity</i>. In practice, it is usually provided by a
small component called <b>S(ubstitution)-box</b>. An S-box is a function
operating on a small enough input that its output can be specified by
its lookup table. The round function then contains the parallel
application of said S-box over the whole state.
</p>

<p>
The Russian algorithms both use the same S-box, Ï€. It is specified via
its lookup table (Figure <a href="#fig:lut-pi">1</a>).
</p>


<div id="fig:lut-pi">
<p><img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/figures/gost-pi.png" alt="gost-pi.png" width="500px">
</p>
<p><span>Figure 1:</span> The lookup table of <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_8bd9a5eb6b6aba756eb935763560fc85f51af323.png" alt="$\pi$"> as it appears in its specification [<a href="#kuz-spec">3</a>]. This function maps 0 to 252, 1 to 238, â€¦, and 255 to 182.</p>
</div>

<p>
The cryptographic properties of the S-box play a crucial role in the
security of the algorithm because they are the only source of
non-linearity. They are also at the center of the security arguments
given by algorithm designers. In fact, designers are expected to
explain how the S-box they used was designed and why they chose the
structure their S-box has. For example, the AES has an S-box which is
based on the multiplicative inverse in the finite field
<img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_a0935969bb691555d57c264f1596f499d684ebab.png" alt="$\mathrm{GF}(2^8)$">. This choice is motivated by the fact that both the
<i>linearity</i> and the <i>differential uniformity</i> <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> of this
permutation are the lowest known to be possible.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-5">
<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span>1.5</span> Why is it important that we know how an S-box was made?</h3>
<div id="text-1-5">
<p>
While the multiplicative inverse, and in fact the very S-box of the
AES, are popular choices for constructing 8-bit S-boxes, they are not
the only possiblity. I made a survey of the literature and compiled a
list of all the 8-bit S-boxes I could get my hands on<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> during my
PhD [<a href="#phd">2</a>]. They are sorted by structure in Figure <a href="#fig:pollock-pi">2</a>. As
we can see, the structures used vary a lot, from clear mathematical
description to block cipher-like structures. These differences
correspond to different goals. While it is necessary to have good
cryptographic properties, it is also essential that the S-box be easy
to implement for example in hardware. Depending on the priority of
these constraints, the designers will use different structures.
</p>


<div id="fig:pollock-pi">
<p><img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/figures/structure.png" alt="structure.png" width="500px">
</p>
<p><span>Figure 2:</span> A survey of the structures to build the 8-bit S-boxes appearing in more than 50 different symmetric algorithms (from my PhD [<a href="#phd">2</a>]).</p>
</div>

<p>
In order to benefit from the easy implementation allowed by a given
structure, it is necessary that the structure be public. More
importantly, in order for cryptographers to be able to analyse the
cipher properly, it is necessary that they are given <b>all</b> the
information available and in particular the structure used to
construct the S-box. It could be that the S-box interacts in an
undesirable way with other components of the cipher and this
interaction can only be noticed if the structure is known.
</p>

<p>
To see an example of the kind of constraints and trade-offs that
naturally occur when designing an S-box, you can have a look at at
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/iGeC0IO9K0AGS_AvUHcOLMfd8Dk">this e-mail</a> sent to the CFRG mailing list by one of the designers of
the Belarussian standard, BelT. He explains why they decided to choose
an S-box based on a discrete exponentiationâ€”a choice I personally see
nothing wrong with.

<h2 id="sec-2"><span>2</span> My Latest Result: the TKlog Structure of Ï€</h2>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1">
<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span>2.1</span> What is the structure of Ï€</h3>
<div id="text-2-1">
<p>
The authors of Streebog and Kuznyechik have provided little to no
information about their design process. Several cryptographers have
tried to ask them about the structure of their S-box during
conferences. The usual answer was equivalent to saying that they were
picked at random from some set. They also claim to have lost the
generation algorithm. Given the importance of the S-box, this loss
should be worrying in and of itself.
</p>

<p>
With my co-authors Aleksei Udovenko and Alex Biryukov, we first
identified two different decompositions of Ï€ which were published at
two peer-reviewed venues: the conference EUROCRYPT'16 for the first
[<a href="#streebog">6</a>] and the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology for the
second [<a href="#belt">7</a>]. However, below, I will mostly talk about the third
decomposition which has been published<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> in a later edition of the
IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology [<a href="#kuz-final">1</a>]. It is based on
a structure which I called <i>TKlog</i>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1-1">
<h4 id="sec-2-1-1"><span>2.1.1</span> The TKlog</h4>
<div id="text-2-1-1">
<p>
The TKlog, which I named after the TK26 (<a href="https://tc26.ru/en/">Technical Committee 26</a>, the
designers of the Russian algorithms), is a special family of
permutations of which <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_8bd9a5eb6b6aba756eb935763560fc85f51af323.png" alt="$\pi$"> is a member. These are defined by
composing a discrete logarithm (mapping finite field elements to
integers) with a strange but simple permutation mapping the integers
back to finite field elements.
</p>

<p>
My claim that Ï€ has a TKlog structure is not up for debate: the
unconvinced reader can simply run the small SAGE script below and see
that it does indeed generate the right lookup table. It also shows the
general TKlog structure: simply change <code>cstt</code>, <code>lambda_vectors</code> or
<code>s</code> to generate another TKlog instance<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1-3">
<h4 id="sec-2-1-3"><span>2.1.3</span> Why would the third one be "correct"?</h4>
<div id="text-2-1-3">
<p>
Good question: since there are multiple ways of computing this
function, why would the TKlog be the one originally intended by its
designers?
</p>

<p>
This third decomposition is by far the simplest in terms of
mathematics: it is completely described by a simple system of three
equations, unlike the others. It also requires the fewest "arbitrary"
constants; in fact, there are only about <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_73e944f9a78ec2bd9f9f5b9e1884475993b6927f.png" alt="$2^{82.6}$"> different TKlog
instances operating on 8 bits. This number is astonishingly <b>small</b>
compared to the total number of 8-bit permutations, namely <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_352415b5a7dbb46d7d0c806404ec1c04bace2550.png" alt="$256!
\approx 2^{1684}$">. Hence, the probability for a random 8-bit
permutation to be a TKlog is around <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_82a4b2fbe843e824e4d79d441ccdb9be0613c21e.png" alt="$2^{82.6-1684} \approx 2^{-1601}$">.
</p>

<p>
Let's put this number into perspective. The probability of winning the
French lottery<sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> is around <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_18ab740470624fff3eeb55622bdb37ef43bad7f4.png" alt="$2^{-24.2}$">. Thus, the probability of
obtaining a TKlog by picking an 8-bit permutation at random is
comparable to the probability of winning the French lottery <b>66 times
in a row</b>!
</p>

<p>
If someone were to win this lottery 66 times in a row, would you
conclude that they are astonishingly lucky or that some shenanigans
were involved when picking the "random" numbers? The latter is the
natural conclusion. Using the same reasoning, I claim that the
presence of this structure in <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_8bd9a5eb6b6aba756eb935763560fc85f51af323.png" alt="$\pi$"> is intentional.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-1-4"><span>2.1.4</span> Isn't this somewhat coherent with their claims?</h4>
<div id="text-2-1-4">
<p>
One of the only claims made by the designers of these algorithms is
that they picked their S-box at random from some set of S-boxes. If they
picked the parameters of the TKlog randomly, wouldn't their design
<i>technically</i> match this description?
</p>

<p>
In my opinion, no.
</p>

<p>
Suppose that someone tells you that they are going to choose 5 numbers
between <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_51bb6ac43d43d806063fae019f3d94dabebd9a40.png" alt="$0$"> and <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_d629b3404084e6bac5612df442d379bb5a7801dc.png" alt="$1,000,000$"> randomly. To your surprise, they chose <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_1f0eb0e7188640a672314afff2b61ea0aa9154c9.png" alt="$5,
2,4,5$"> and <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_bbb4e25c3f2802d22c94d2f5db459a6b0301eaef.png" alt="$3$">. When confronting them about the obvious pattern in their
result, they tell you that they used 6-sided dice rolls (i.e., a random
process) to generate these numbers and that they are indeed between
<img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_51bb6ac43d43d806063fae019f3d94dabebd9a40.png" alt="$0$"> and <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_d629b3404084e6bac5612df442d379bb5a7801dc.png" alt="$1,000,000$">. In this case, your friend left out so much information
about their process that the little given was essentially meaningless,
if not misleading.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the authors of Streebog have argued in informal
discussions (see a summary in [<a href="#Saarinen">9</a>]) that they wanted to avoid
having too strong an algebraic structure in order to prevent some
attacks. While there is nothing wrong with this approach a priori, it
is completely at odds with their final result: as shown in the next
section, their S-box has an extremely strong algebraic structure.

<div id="text-2-3">
<p>
First of all, that is very strong algebraic structure where they
previously claimed that there was none.
</p>

<p>
Second, Arnaud Bannier established in his PhD thesis [<a href="#bannier">10</a>] that,
in order to construct a block cipher with a backdoor of a certain
type, it was necessary to construct an S-box mapping sets of the form
<img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_32de818f6c7bd4efc561ac11a2c64f1e8e495bd8.png" alt="$\{ b \oplus x, x \in V \}$"> to ones of the form <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_f4ff51be8a7b550299366d715d379c6cd4e17617.png" alt="$\{ b \oplus x, x \in
W \}$">, where <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_3c71664b59e4d934f9b331f4f73107d85d8274bc.png" alt="$V$"> and <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_358332bbe8c15d07fe0d089d2f27bf21cfde4b99.png" alt="$W$"> are vector subspaces of <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_67f2d3eb58a50c8f8d24283d62ea14457023c2f6.png" alt="$\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$">
(for instance, <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_84bdee4461ffd0b7daf6ad82067edcd26e93ae05.png" alt="$\mathbb{F}_{2^4}$"> is a vector subspace of

</p>

<p>
That is not quite the situation we have here as <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_8bd9a5eb6b6aba756eb935763560fc85f51af323.png" alt="$\pi$"> has such a
partition in its output but not in its input. However, in the case of
Streebog, the linear layer interacts in a weird way (which we have yet
to completely understand) with sets of both shapes, i.e. <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_c3aa8296f424ce2c32a77bd42bf9ca80c2b70d77.png" alt="$\{ b \oplus
x, x \in \mathbb{F}_{2^4} \}$"> and <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_23f0f8bd346fa2b36fe0fce88bd11b28bf779cfb.png" alt="$\{ b \odot x, x \in
\mathbb{F}_{2^4} \}$">.
</p>

<p>
By the way, this linear layer was originally specified as a <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_0880ee117f9d9968c4c988403472176fdd69ac78.png" alt="$64 \times
64$"> binary matrix, i.e. using only 0 and 1, while it is simply
described by an <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_bf979f5ca06e7c59329985bce90c72e49fdef333.png" alt="$8 \times 8$"> matrix with elements in
<img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_c7b4b2d7c8717ba1e10c817f064c49a36837030b.png" alt="$\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$">.  It is strange that this structure was not
disclosed by the designers, especially considering that it is a
natural choice: such matrices defined over <img src="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/ltxpng/pi_c7b4b2d7c8717ba1e10c817f064c49a36837030b.png" alt="$\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$"> are
common in symmetric cryptography; the AES itself uses one. Why then
keep it secret?
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, the design process of this matrix is also
unknown. Reverse-engineering it is an open problem!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4">
<h3 id="sec-2-4"><span>2.4</span> Soâ€¦ is it a backdoor?</h3>
<div id="text-2-4">
<p>
First of all, I would like to emphasize that <b>I have not found
an attack leveraging these properties</b>.
</p>

<p>
Still, I don't know the answer to the question above and, to put it
bluntly, I don't think we need to know. What I think matters is
whether or not this structure can lead to attacks against these
algorithms. As explained in the answer to the previous question, it is
a possibility. If it is indeed an exploitable flaw, why and how it
ended up in these ciphers is their designers' problem, not the
users'. The generation process of their S-box may have been
compromised by someone else for all we knowâ€”which highlights the
main issue behind these algorithms: while I have recovered the
structure that was used to generate this componentâ€¦
</p>

<p>
<b>â€¦ we don't even know for sure who designed it or what their purpose was when they did.</b>
</p>


<p>
That is why I recommend that, until their designers provide a
detailed explanation of their complete design process, you do <b>not</b>
use these algorithms and, should you be in a position to make such a
decision, that you do not standardize them.

<h2 id="sec-3"><span>3</span> Update (22 May 2019)</h2>
<p>
Since the publication of [<a href="#kuz-final">1</a>], the designers of Ï€ have insisted
that the presence of the TKlog was a mere coincidence. Their arguments
are factually wrong. The paper proving it is [<a href="#golf">11</a>] and I wrote a
vulgarized explanation on <a href="https://who.paris.inria.fr/Leo.Perrin/code-golf.html">this page</a>.
