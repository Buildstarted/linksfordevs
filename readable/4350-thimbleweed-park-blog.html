I remember I really liked the puzzle chain during Delores' flashback - I got a bit stuck the first time I played the game, but all I needed to do was stop and think about the possible solutions. I loved how logical it was in the end. No obscure "randomly combine this with that until something happens".<br></p><p><b>What are you working on now?</b><br>Well, let's say I'm planning to practice some game development. But it's very early to say anything more about this hobby project of mine. I'm also still involved in Thimbleweed Park-related work (as a community manager most of the time, and as a tester when the need arises). Working on this game has been a blast.

one-year anniversary is this Friday, and to help commiserate (I mean celebrate) the game is going to be 50% off for one day on all platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're thinking of picking it up, you might want to hold off a few days.<br></p><p>This will be the deepest discount we've offered, after that, it's back to our normal price (but still less than the Guybrush approved price for a video game).<br></p><hr></div><div class="entryBody"><p class="date">by Ron Gilbert<br>Mar 14, 2018</p><p>Physical releases of Thimbleweed Park are coming for the PS4 and The Switch courtesy of <a

kid friendly" DLC all of Ransome's beeps can be remove and you'll be able to hear Ransome in all his unbeeped glory.<br></p><p>Available now on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/638280/Thimbleweed_Park__Ransome_Unbeeped/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/thimbleweed_park_ransome_unbeeped">GOG</a>!</p><center><p>Unfortunately, the DLC will only be on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/638280/Thimbleweed_Park__Ransome_Unbeeped/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/thimbleweed_park_ransome_unbeeped">GOG</a>. All the other platforms require that DLC be rated the same as the main game (they do make exceptions for some AA game, surprise, surprise) so it won't be coming to Switch, XBox, PS4 or mobile.&nbsp;&nbsp;We apologize in advance, but that is out of our hands.<br></p><p>When Lauen and I wrote the script, we didn't add the swearing, we just put in <b>*beeping</b>* or <b>*beeper</b>*.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding the swearing would have meant some pre-process to remove them all and it would have been hell on translators.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also more fun to write because I had no idea what he was really saying.<br></p><p>When we got to the studio, I wasn't sure if the actor was going to swear or just say "beep".&nbsp;&nbsp;We did some tests and it was pretty obvious that having Ransome say "beep" really undercut his personality.&nbsp;&nbsp;You got the impression that Ransome was censoring himself, which he would never do.<br></p><p>So, we decided to have the actor (Ian Corlett) go full on swearing. The problem was the script didn't contain swear words, just <b>*beep</b>*, <b>*beeper</b>* or <b>*beeping</b>*.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ian didn't think he'd have a problem just filling in the swear words on the fly and it was amazing to listen to.&nbsp;&nbsp;He would do first run cold readings and seamlessly add swear words.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was amazing and hilarious.<br></p><p>I hope you enjoy and please, keep the kids away.

I had an immense amount of fun pretending to be a game developer for MmucasFlem games! And now, with this handy guide, you too can have fun!</p><h2>Assemble your outfit</h2><p>Let's start with some reference pictures of Delores.<br></p><p>You've got to get all the essentials together to be able to become Delores. Let's go down from head to foot.<br></p><h3>Head</h3><p>The glasses are the most important part of the entire outfit. If you're going the simple option, just get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZO1SEN/">these glasses</a> and forget everything else!</p><p>If you naturally have Delores' hair, then I'm super jealous! For everyone else...<br></p><p>▶︎ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001681W16/">Temporarily dye your hair</a><br>▶︎ Get a wig, there are many cheap ones available, but I like <a href="https://www.arda-wigs.com/collections/classic-medium/products/buttercup-classic?variant=27836393030">this one from Arda</a>.<br></p><h3>Torso</h3><p>You'll need a t-shirt and jacket.<br></p><p>Delores' shirt was created to mimic Dave's shirt in Maniac Mansion. Dave's shirt is gray with the Lucasfilm logo. So by extension, you can wear any purple shirt with a slogan on it, although I'm sure Delores would prefer MmucasFlem or some other games company logo.<br></p><p>I created as close a replica as I could on <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/jennsand/works/27604596-deloresand-39-s-shirt?asc=u&amp;p=womens-fitted-scoop&amp;rel=carousel">Red Bubble as a scoop-neck women's shirt</a>.<br></p><p>For the jacket, Octavi, who drew Delores, assures me that her jacket is a denim jacket like <a href="http://www.hm.com/us/product/63972">this light blue one</a>.<br></p><h3>Legs &amp; Feet</h3><p>For jeans, I'm not going to give you a link to find blue jeans because... well... I'm sure you have something that will work! Fold up at the bottom so they're pretty high.<br></p><p>The most important thing is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VF2F1NS/">curly pink laces</a>. But make sure you also get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GS3CEQ/">white socks</a> and plain white shoes (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Womens-Cloudfoam-Advantage-Sneakers/dp/B01HSIVG9A/">these ones are pretty comfy</a>).<br></p><h3>Accessories</h3><p>Getting a bag that fits what you want and looks authentic is pretty hard. Still, most cosplay characters don't have any bag at all, so I feel like it's a bit of a luxury to be able to stay in character AND get to carry around my mobile phone and keys.<br></p><p>I ended up settling for a bag that wasn't quite right, but was a bag that I had in my bag collection anyways. If you can make your own bag, do that! But otherwise, maybe <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GEARONIC-TM-Crossbody-Shoulder-Messenger/dp/B014G943WQ/">this</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/collection-Crossbody-%EF%BD%9EMessenger-Women-multiple-2830/dp/B01MU8D2OV/">that</a> option from Amazon will work for you.<br></p><p>Now you've got all the basics, you can add in some fun things!</p><p>Like a balloon animal....<br></p><p>Or make some damn, fine Thimbleberry Pie...<br></p><p>You can also make yourself a notebook to remember all the things on your TO DO list. You're aiming for something like this:</p><p>You'll need a blue notebook with spiral binding. I'd recommend picking up something in your local supermarket or office supplies place. However, if you're desperate, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hardcover-Wirebound-Notebook-Journal-2-Notebooks/dp/B06WW8872Q/">this one from Amazon</a> looks about right.<br></p><p>Download <a href="http:/images.thimbleweedpark.com/DeloresJournalStickers.zip">this zip folder with the plain front cover and stickers</a>.<br></p><h2>Get In Character</h2><p>While cosplaying Delores, don't forget to practice your victory dance and learn to these classic quotes:</p><p>▶︎ "But I just want to design games."<br>▶︎ "If this were a Sierra On-Line graphic adventure, I'd be dead now."<br>▶︎ "It's my speck of dust."<br></p><p>Here's some pictures of me cosplaying Delores for inspiration.<br></p><p>"I'd love to talk to him, but I'm too shy, what with him being famous and all."</p><p>Do NOT attempt to match your head size to Delores, you'll fall over!</p><p>The wig really brings the costume to life and also signals to people around you that "yes, I am cosplaying a character!"</p><p>This is me on the left and Elise Kates, the voice of Delores on the right! So much Delores in one photo.<br></p><p>And since I have no shame, I attempted to reproduce the classic "I got a job at MmucasFlem games"-dance! Turns out doing a good moonwalk is REALLY hard! ;)</p><center><p>And that is all! Have fun being Delores!</p><hr></center></div><div class="entryBody"><p class="date"><br>Oct 10, 2017</p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.terribletoybox.thimbleweedparkandroid">Google Play Store</a></p><p>Good things come to those who wait (and after I've had my morning coffee).<br></p><p>If you're having support issues, please head over to the <a href="https://forums.thimbleweedpark.com/c/support">support thread on the forums</a>.<br></p><hr></div><div class="entryBody"><p class="date">by Ron Gilbert<br>Oct 02, 2017</p><p>The bad news is we're slipping the Android version by a week, from the 3rd to the 10th of October.&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news is the Android build will fully support controllers, mouse and keyboard, plus a wider range of hardware.<br></p><p>Android is always hard due to the vast array of devices.

It's much harder than iOS due to the huge variety of hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp;We've come across a couple of GPUs that don't have the power, or are just buggy and needed to rewrite some of our shaders.<br></p><p>We're also trying to get full controller, mouse and keyboard support into the Android, which is also proving to be more work than anticipated.<br></p><p>Yeah, I know. Bitch, bitch, bitch. Bring us solutions Mr. Gilbert, not problems.<br></p><p>- Ron</p><p>P.S. The PS4 port has been live for several weeks now.<br></p><hr></div><div class="entryBody"><p class="date">by Ron Gilbert<br>Jun 20, 2017</p><p>There is a new Thimbleweed Park update (Build 1388.918) that includes two major additions and several minor ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;This build should be live on Steam and will be live on GOG in the next 24 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to approvals and reviews, it will be a few weeks before it makes it to the App Store and Xbox.<br></p><p>The first big change is player character dialogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can now TALK TO Delores, Ray, Reyes and Ransome.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no point in adding Franklin dialogs, since you can't really talk to him, and he had one-sided stubs for trying to talk to other players.<br></p><p>This was something I attempted during initial production but abandoned due to me being unable to think about it as anything more than an a overly complex hint system. It always felt to me that all you'd want to do was talk to the other characters and get hints, and the early iterations of the system really showed that, so I abandon it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was also getting short and there was a lot of work to be done, so it wasn't matter of me writing player dialogs or hanging out at the beach.<br></p><p>This turned out to be a mistake. I should have pressed forward and implemented this.<br></p><p>Allowing the characters to talk to each other actually solved a bunch of problems. It was crystal clear (in our heads) why they were working together (or didn't care if they were), but that wasn't clear to players. This is especially true with Ransome. Ransome is an asshole. Why would he be helping?</p><p>Player character dialogs solved this problem. You now can chat amongst yourselves while spouting plot clarifying lines. If I had a few extra months I would have made them ever more complex, but maybe they don't need to be. I'm sure someone will complain that they didn't talk about X and that is plot critical. Maybe. Maybe not. I do think the dialogs help tremendously and I regret not pushing forward and implementing them from the get-go.<br></p><p>The other slightly related feature we implement was greetings.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ray walks by Delores, she will say a quick one line greeting, same for Reyes, Ransome and Delores. None of these are plot revealing, but do make the world feel more alive and real.<br></p><p>The biggest change was a new in-game hint system. I know this will cause the hardcore adventure gamer's blood to boil (as it does mine), but the lack of hints was widely criticized by some of the more casual press.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move to new and more casual platforms like iOS and Android, this becomes increasingly important. I guess it's a sad fact about not only modern gamers, but older gamers that just don't have 18 hours to spend on a game.<br></p><p>The first (failed) iteration of the design was based around a new object called the "HintTron 3000™".&nbsp;&nbsp;You would find it alongside the road and pick it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;You could then use it on any object in the game and it would give you a context appropriate hint.<br></p><p>On paper, it seemed like a good idea, until the first implementation and the problems came roaring out. The biggest problem was when you're stuck it's often at a conceptual level and you don't even know what object to click on. This could cause players to randomly click on stuff, hoping the get a hint with no real idea what they needed.<br></p><p>To stop non-stop hint-clicking, we added some friction in the form of a "cooldown", but it felt artificial and frustrating. We thought about adding a "currency" you find or earn (specks of dust), but these all ran into the issue os rarity and frustration when you can't find or earn them and you need a hint.<br></p><p>So we abandon the idea. David wrote a lot of code for this... so... a moment of silence.<br></p><p>To me, the most important part of any in-game hint system is making sure it feels like part of the world and game. I didn't want to do a hint system that was all UI based.<br></p><p>Back in the 80s, we had hint books with red gel, but we also had phone in hint lines.<br></p><p>Thimbleweed Park already has a working phone, so it seemed natural to just have a hint line number you could call and get a hint.<br></p><p>We once again toyed with the idea of a currency. You're using a phone, so finding money to use it made sense, but unfortunately, the phone is needed for other things and we didn't want to muck up all that with making them all pay phones, plus some of the phones are in the mansion and hotel. We beat it around for a bit, then just decided to making the hint line "free" to use.<br></p><p>Calling the phone provides some natural friction, in that you'd have to get to a phone (or switch to whoever had the cel phone) and make a call and trip down a hint tree.<br></p><p>The advantage we had over a true 80s hint line was that we know the context of where you are in the game, so the hint line can be smart and focus down to hints we know you might needed, and ignore spoilers and other distractions.<br></p><p>Jenn volunteered to take on the job, and we based it (with permission) on the existing <a href="http://philome.la/IndieGames_Muso/tiny-incremental-hints-for-thimbleweed-park">online hints of Meghann O'Neill</a>, so we had a good starting place.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a nice system and hopefully newer players find it fun and helpful.<br></p><p>Now, we know it's not going to be for everyone, but it is 100% optional in that you just don't call it. But I know one's willpower can be weak.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you set...<br></p><p class="code">hintsEnabled:&nbsp;<span class="number">0</span><br></p><p>When you call the hint line, the phone will just ring and ring.<br></p><p>One tricky issue is old save games. To fully implement the AI of the hintTron, we had to add some new variables to track game state. If you load an old savegame, those variables don't exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenn wrote some fancy code to try and predict an old savegame's state. It works 90% of the time, but if you load old games, hints might not be 100% accurate.<br></p><p>And lastly, I implemented some new keyboard commands.<br></p><p>1-6 will now selected dialog choices or they can be reassigned using...<br></p><p class="code">keyChoice1:&nbsp;<span class="string"><span class="string">"<span class="number">1</span>"</span></span><br>keyChoice2:&nbsp;<span class="string"><span class="string">"<span class="number">2</span>"</span></span><br>keyChoice3:&nbsp;<span class="string"><span class="string">"<span class="number">3</span>"</span></span><br>keyChoice4:&nbsp;<span class="string"><span class="string">"<span class="number">4</span>"</span></span><br>keyChoice5:&nbsp;<span class="string"><span class="string">"<span class="number">5</span>"</span></span><br>keyChoice6:&nbsp;<span class="string"><span class="string">"<span class="number">6</span>"</span></span><br></p><p>You can assign keys to cycle through characters using...<br></p><p class="code">keySelectNext:&nbsp;<span class="string"><span class="string">"<span class="number">0</span>"</span></span><br>keySelectPrev:&nbsp;<span class="string"><span class="string">"<span class="number">9</span>"</span></span><br></p><p>You can now disable initing of the controller by adding...<br></p><p class="code">disableController:&nbsp;<span class="number">1</span><br></p><p>If you don't have the willpower to avoid calling the new hint lines, you can add...<br></p><p class="code">hintsEnabled:&nbsp;<span class="number">0</span><br></p><p>There we more keyboard commands (like the numpad) that I ran out of time, but I'll save those for another update... because god knows, I can't stop working on this fucking game.<br></p><p>That arcade machines will make it into the next major update, probably when iOS and Android are released.<br></p><p><a href="https://forums.thimbleweedpark.com/t/thimbleweed-park-update-917-is-live/833?">Come talk about it on the Official Thimbleweed Park Forums.</a></p><p>- Ron</p><hr></div><div class="entryBody"><p class="date">by Ron Gilbert<br>May 05, 2017</p><p>Announcing the <a href="https://forums.thimbleweedpark.com/">Official Thimbleweed Park Forums</a>.

At this point, we knew the basic story, in so much as these agents show up to investigate the body, and there was a clown, a dead guy and computer programmer.<br></p><p>We didn't really know how the game would end, or how we'd get there, but hey, that is the fun part.<br></p><p>After the first brainstorm session, Gary had the idea of a big factory and this tube based AI. It seemed ripe for digging, so we ran with that and never looked back.<br></p><p>A couple of months later, David Fox joined the team and we started to get into the nitty-gritty of solving the murder.<br></p><p>After the first day with David, I was really bothered by all the details of finding evidence. It seemed like an arbitrary&nbsp;&nbsp;jumble and players would be lost.<br></p><p>I went home feeling a little dejected and overwhelmed. What the evidence gathering stage needed was focus, then the idea of TronMachines hit me. By placing them in the Coroners office, it would give that focus. The TronMachines wanted specific items, and that meshed better with how an adventure game worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;David and Gary seemed to like the idea and it gave out design sessions more focus as well (always a good idea).<br></p><p>Originally the Coroner's office had 4 TronMachines, the BloodTron, FaceTron, FingerTron and EnhanceTron.&nbsp;&nbsp;The EnhanceTron was going to be used to enhance a video image taken from the Quickie Pal video camera, but it felt like too much, so we cut it.<br></p><p>We saved the flashbacks for last, and for those brainstorm sessions Jenn join us. Ransome's flashback started to get huge and we cut it back significantly.<br></p><p>We took pictures of the white boards at the end of each session, or before we erased them.<br></p><p>Most of what you see made it into the game, although tweaked quite a bit. Other parts never got off the whiteboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of it made it off the whiteboard and into the wireframe version, but was cut before final art.<br></p><p><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_1.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_2.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_5.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_7.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_8.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_9.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_10.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_11.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_12.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_13.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_14.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_15.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_16.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_17.jpg"><img class="image" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.thimbleweedpark.com/whiteboard_18.jpg"></p><hr></div></div></div></div>
