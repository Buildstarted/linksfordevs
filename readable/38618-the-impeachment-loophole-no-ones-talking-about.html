<p>A nugget of political arithmetic is suddenly everywhere: &#x201C;Two-thirds majority.&#x201D; This is the share of votes required to convict <strong>President</strong><strong>&#xA0;Trump</strong>&#xA0;in an impeachment trial in the United States Senate. That&#x2019;s 67 senators, if you&#x2019;re counting&#x2014;or, in the glass-half-empty variation, the number of Republican senators required to jump ship is&#xA0;20.</p>
<p>Mostly, these numbers are used to cast doubtful sentiments on the prospect of impeachment. As CNN&#xA0;correspondent <strong>Manu Raju</strong> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-impeachment-inquiry-09-25-2019/h_720582209195ffd55306abfdd6923f74">reports</a>, convicting Trump &#x201C;would require support from a two-thirds majority of the Senate&#x2014;a highly unlikely proposition.&#x201D; The same numbers, and the same conclusion, have been popularized by&#xA0;<strong><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/hardball/2019-09-27">Chris Matthews</a></strong>,&#xA0;<a href="https://youtu.be/8-mYRJjzWsA?t=216"><strong>Rachel</strong> <strong>Maddow</strong>,</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/all-in/2019-03-12"><strong>Chris Hayes</strong></a>; <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/rachel-maddow-show/2019-09-24">presidential candidates</a>&#xA0;and <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/all-in/2019-03-12">members of Congress</a>; <em><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/27/jeff-flake-at-least-35-gop-senators-would-impeach-trump/3792866002/">USA Today</a></em>&#xA0;and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-explainer/explainer-what-it-would-take-for-congress-to-impeach-trump-idUSKBN1W822S">Reuters</a>,&#xA0;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/24/what-it-would-take-for-congress-to-impeach-trump.html">CNBC</a> and&#xA0;<a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/25/20882860/house-democrats-impeachment-inquiry-donald-trump-nancy-pelosi">Vox&#x2019;s</a> <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/voxs-the-weeds/e/64453873"><strong>Matthew Yglesias</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This is especially true among the President&#x2019;s champions, who cheerfully assure the GOP faithful that Trump&#x2019;s fortunes are sealed by math. <strong>Hans von Spakovsky</strong> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/hans-von-spakovsky-trump-impeachment-effort-will-be-historic-political-battle-heres-how-process-works">did that on Fox News&#xA0;</a>this week, when he argued that &#x201C;67 votes are needed in the 100-member Senate to remove the president&#x2026;a very high hurdle that&#x2019;s probably impossible to leap over in the case of President Trump.&#x201D;</p>
<p>If Fox News is to believed, the 67 figure is ironclad. Airtight. Right?</p> <p>Not so fast.</p>
<p>The Constitution doesn&#x2019;t indicate that removal from office requires two-thirds of the Senate. It requires two-thirds of senators&#xA0;<em>present</em> for the proceedings.</p>
<p>The inclusion of this single word in the Constitution&#x2019;s impeachment clauses shifts the mathematical ledger of how impeachment, however unlikely, could go down. It allows for the all-important two-thirds threshold to exist along a sliding scale&#x2014;far from the full attendance of the 100-member Senate. In theory, a vote to convict the President (or anyone else) would count as legal with as few as 34 members, not 67, assuming the absolute minimum (51) participated.</p> <p>&#x201C;The Constitution contains quorum requirements [elsewhere] and clearly distinguishes between percentages of a particular chamber and percentages of &#x2018;members present,&apos;&#x201D; said <strong>Laurence Tribe</strong>, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School and the co-author of the book&#xA0;<em>To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment</em>. &#x201C;That language in the provision for Senate conviction on impeachment charges is quite deliberate, creating precisely the possibility&#x201D; described above.</p>
<p>The Senate&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/impeach/senaterules.pdf">formal rules on impeachment</a>, last updated in 1986, repeat the Constitution&#x2019;s &#x201C;present&#x201D; provision numerous times.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a sliding scale,&#x201D; says <strong>Alan Frumin</strong>, the former Parliamentarian of the Senate who now holds emeritus status. &#x201C;In other words, it&#x2019;s not an absolute two-thirds, it&#x2019;s two-thirds of some number. And there you get to the question of the denominator.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This rule could become relevant in a variety of ways. The most significant is the number of Republicans actually required to &#x201C;jump the fence,&#x201D; as Democrats hope. Twenty Republicans is a tall order: Even for Republicans who are shielded from reelection in 2020, a vote to convict Trump is obviously hazardous. If a few Republicans didn&#x2019;t appear, that would reduce the number of Republicans required to vote with Democrats.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s also a more stark scenario. Recently, former Senator <strong>Jeff Flake</strong> speculated that at least&#xA0;<a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2019/09/27/impeachment-inquiry-gop-jeff-flake">30 Republican senators would cast their vote for impeachment</a> against Trump&#x2014;but only if it were held on a secret ballot. (Flake went further, suggesting the number might be as high as 35.)</p> </div>
<p>But suppose those 30 senators were seeking a way, as Flake suggested, to remove Trump while avoiding the rage of his base. They might boycott the proceedings&#x2014;or, when the big day of the vote arrived, mysteriously not show up. With 70 members now present, the number of senators required to convict Trump is no longer 67. It&#x2019;s 47: exactly the number of seats Democrats and independents currently hold in the Senate.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re talking about Republicans who want to remove him but don&#x2019;t want to say something. How does their absence make that more likely? They might otherwise be a vote for conviction. But they&#x2019;re not going to show up,&#x201D; says Frumin. &#x201C;Conceptually, that&#x2019;s sound.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The above scenario isn&#x2019;t entirely foolproof, though. The rule isn&#x2019;t operative in the case of abstentions&#x2014;or, as Frumin puts it, &#x201C;They could &#x2018;show up&#x2019; and &#x2018;shut up.&apos;&#x201D; Senators in the chamber who abstain, or even refuse to vote, are still in essence voting &#x201C;no,&#x201D; because their very presence inflates the denominator required to reach two-thirds, explained Frumin. This became clear during the impeachment trial of <strong>Bill Clinton</strong>, when <strong>Arlen Specter</strong> refused to vote &#x201C;guilty&#x201D; or &#x201C;not guilty,&#x201D; instead registering a vote of &#x201C;not proven.&#x201D; Chief Justice <strong>William Rehnquist</strong> ordered the vote to be tallied as &#x201C;not guilty.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And the Senate could, in theory, exercise its power for compulsory attendance, directing the sergeant-at-arms to arrest fugitive senators and haul them back to the chamber for the vote. But such power is only used in cases where a quorum is missing&#x2014;to go from, say, 49 to 51&#x2014;but never from 70 to 100, making its use in such a scenario unprecedented, and likely an abuse of power. (Frumin thinks it would violate the rules.) Of course, that hasn&#x2019;t stopped <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> before. But any measure to enlist the sergeant-at-arms would require a majority of the senators who were&#x2014;well, <em>present</em>. (See how useful this word is?) If 30 members were absent, Democrats would presumably defeat the motion to compel the missing senators&#x2019; attendance, 47-23.</p>
<p>How likely is the above scenario? Not very. But as long as the country is preparing itself for any outcome, we might as well start using the correct numbers. &#x201C;The rule,&#x201D; says Frumin, &#x201C;is pretty clear.&#x201D;</p>
