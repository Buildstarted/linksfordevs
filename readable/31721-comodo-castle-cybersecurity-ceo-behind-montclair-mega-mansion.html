Abdulhayoglu is the owner of a Montclair home that was previously an expanded ranch home. Sold in 2004 for $849,900, the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/baristanet/baristanet/baristanetnew/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/21083422/Screen-Shot-2019-03-21-at-8.33.25-AM.png">1950s-era home was subsequently torn down and replaced by a much larger home.</a></p></div></div></div></div>
