Tough. That's _your_ choice. Your hardware limitations<br>shouldn't be a pain for the rest of us.</p><p>Longer lines are fundamentally useful. My monitor is not only a lot<br>wider than it is tall, my fonts are universally narrower than they are<br>tall. Long lines are natural.</p><p>When I tile my terminal windows on my display, I can have 6 terminals<br>visible at one time, and that's because I have them three wide. And I<br>could still fit 80% of a fourth one side-by-side.</p><p>And guess what? That's with my default "100x50" terminal window (go to<br>your gnome terminal settings, you'll find that the 80x25 thing is just<br>an initial default that you can change), not with some 80x25 one. And<br>that's with a font that has anti-aliasing and isn't some pixelated<br>mess.</p><p>And most of my terminals actually end up being dragged wider and<br>taller than that. I checked, and my main one is 142x76 characters<br>right now, because it turns out that wider (and taller) terminals are<br>useful not just for source code.</p><p>Have you looked at "ps ax" output lately? Or used "top"? Or done "git<br>diff --stat" or any number of things where it turns out that 80x25 is<br>really really limiting, and is simply NO LONGER RELEVANT to most of<br>us.</p><p>So no. I do not care about somebody with a 80x25 terminal window<br>getting line wrapping.</p><p>For exactly the same reason I find it completely irrelevant if<br>somebody says that their kernel compile takes 10 hours because they<br>are doing kernel development on a Raspberry PI with 4GB of RAM.</p><p>People with restrictive hardware shouldn't make it more inconvenient<br>for people who have better resources. Yes, we'll accommodate things to<br>within reasonable limits. But no, 80-column terminals in 2020 isn't<br>"reasonable" any more as far as I'm concerned. People commonly used<br>132-column terminals even back in the 80's, for chrissake, don't try<br>to make 80 columns some immovable standard.</p><p>If you choose to use a 80-column terminal, you can live with the line<br>wrapping. It's just that simple.</p><p>And longer lines are simply useful. Part of that is that we aren't<br>programming in the 80's any more, and our source code is fundamentally<br>wider as a result.</p><p>Yes, local iteration variables are still called 'i', because more<br>context just isn't helpful for some anonymous counter. Being concise<br>is still a good thing, and overly verbose names are not inherently<br>better.</p><p>But still - it's entirely reasonable to have variable names that are<br>10-15 characters and it makes the code more legible. Writing things<br>out instead of using abbreviations etc.</p><p>And yes, we do use wide tabs, because that makes indentation something<br>you can visually see in the structure at a glance and on a<br>whole-function basis, rather than something you have to try to<br>visually "line up" things for or count spaces.</p><p>So we have lots of fairly fundamental issues that fairly easily make<br>for longer lines in many circumstances.</p><p>And yes, we do line breaks at some point. But there really isn't any<br>reason to make that point be 80 columns any more.</p><p>                  Linus</p></div></div></div>
