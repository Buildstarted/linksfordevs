    <p>The Cybercrime industry represents an over trillion-dollar industry that is ever-changing and growing all the time—a threat to all companies around the world. Like many in our industry, Blackbaud encounters millions of attacks each month, and our
    expert Cybersecurity team successfully defends against those attacks while constantly studying the landscape to stay ahead of this sophisticated criminal industry. We wanted to notify our customers and other stakeholders about a particular security
    incident that recently occurred.</p><h6><span>Summary of Incident</span></h6><p>In May of 2020, we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. In a ransomware attack, cybercriminals attempt to disrupt the business by locking companies out of their own data and servers. After discovering the attack, our Cyber Security team—together
    with independent forensics experts and law enforcement—successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and fully encrypting files; and ultimately expelled them from our system. Prior to our locking the cybercriminal
    out, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment. The cybercriminal did not access credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers. Because protecting our customers’ data
    is our top priority, we paid the cybercriminal’s demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed. Based on the nature of the incident, our research, and third party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no
    reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. This incident did not involve solutions in our public cloud environment (Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web
    Services), nor did it involve the majority of our self-hosted environment. The subset of customers who were part of this incident have been notified and supplied with additional information and resources. We apologize that this happened and will continue
    to do our very best to supply help and support as we and our customers jointly navigate this cybercrime incident.</p><h6><span>More about Blackbaud’s Cybersecurity Practices and Next Steps Following this Incident</span></h6><p>Over the last five years, we have built a substantial cybersecurity practice with a dedicated team of professionals. Independent reviewers have evaluated our program and determined that it exceeds benchmarks for both the financial and technology sectors.
    We follow industry-standard best practices, conduct ongoing risk assessments, aggressively test the security of our solutions, and continually assess our infrastructure. We are also a member of various Cyber Security thought leadership organizations,
    including: The Cloud Security Alliance and Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), where we team up with other experts to share best practices and tactical threat information for the Cyber Security community. We believe
    the strength of our cybersecurity practice and advance planning is the reason we were able to shut down this sophisticated ransomware attack. We have already implemented changes to prevent this specific issue from happening again. You can review more
