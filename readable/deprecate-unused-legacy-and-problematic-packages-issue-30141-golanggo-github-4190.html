          <p>Remember that deprecation comes with a message, so we can explain the reasons and implications for each package individually, and I'll make sure to provide as much context as possible.</p>
<p>There will be packages that say "this algorithm is broken [or superfluous] because X and should not be used except for compatibility with legacy systems". This does not call for an alternative implementation, but it warns people off using it, and recommends moving to non-broken things.</p>
<p>Other packages will say "this implementation is incomplete and unmantained, consider an alternative protocol like X, or a community maintained package". This hopefully leads to a centralized target for maintenance efforts which does not involve our resources.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am replying to a few points individually below, <strong>before commenting please check if your point was already made above</strong>, to prevent this from becoming a giant thread nobody reads or feels like participating in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that especially the pretty self contained and matured algorithms like MD4 don't suffer much from "being unmaintained".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, deprecating them comes at near-zero cost because there are not going to be new features and bug fixes. But the message to developers about not using them is important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in the XMPP world, the OTR protocol is still used as the standard secure messaging protocol and Signal has virtually no adoption there</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ack, but I'm afraid that's not enough to justify the Go project maintaining an implementation. I would probably not even accept a Signal protocol implementation in x/crypto.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>blowfish can not be compared with AES since the former has a fixed block size of 64 bits;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good point! That makes it fundamentally vulnerable to Sweet32, updated the proposal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact of that a algorithm been used into a public or known project doesn't mean that it doesn't been used at private projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use usage in public projects as an indicator of popularity and therefore usefulness to the ecosystem, not as proof that nobody uses the package at all, and that's one part of the tradeoff decision on whether it's worth the resources to maintain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twofish and also Serpent have greater security than Rijndael</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AES-256 is secure enough for Top Secret data in NSA's Suite B, I don't feel the need to carry anything else to fill a security gap.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The block mode XTS is a block mode very safe, only recommended for full-disk encryption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XTS <a href="https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2014/04/30/you-dont-want-xts/" rel="nofollow">is quite bad</a> in fact.  See also <a href="https://github.com/google/adiantum">a better tweakable cipher</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, I'm one of those folks with a private fork [of openpgp], but I have approval from my employer's legal team to submit our changes upstream</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost half of all issues open against x/crypto packages are for x/crypto/openpgp, and a good chunk of all CLs are for it as well. I'm not blaming the community for not contributing back here, I blame the protocol for requiring too much maintenance to properly implement. It just doesn't make sense for us to put in the effort to do the review and design work to bring this package to a state in which we are happy about it. Hopefully the community will centralize on a fork.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd much rather see people use x/crypto/md4 over some other, random md4 implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MD4 is a bad example, because it's literally as broken as a hash function can be. Go is a memory-safe language, so a random implementation off the street can't introduce an RCE without really trying, and the next worse thing a hash function from the last 20 years can have is a collision, and well, I might still have some Python to generate one on a laptop.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't think the "these algorithms are broken" holds as an argument. A lot of legacy still relies on them, unfortunately. As such, we should rather look at the cost of not deprecating a package.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cost includes developers being misled into thinking that a primitive or protocol can serve their needs because it's in x/crypto, diluting the safety properties of using the standard library.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have we explored why these packages made it into x/crypto in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some to support OpenPGP, some have always been there from before there was a conscious effort to limit what was in x/crypto, some were reasonable at the time and aren't anymore, some were a mistake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everywhere in the standard library, deprecated means "stop using this, move to an alternative".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are using any of the above, I would like you to stop using it and move to an alternative. Sometimes an alternative implementation, sometimes an alternative algorithm. If you know you can't because of legacy compatibility reasons, at least I made you aware of it, and made sure the question got asked at review time, and the answer hopefully documented.</p>
