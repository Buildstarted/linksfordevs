  <p>Incrementally Better Cookies<br>
  <span>draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-latest</span></p>
  
  
<p>This document proposes two changes to cookies inspired by the properties of the HTTP State Tokens mechanism proposed in <a href="#I-D.west-http-state-tokens">[I-D.west-http-state-tokens]</a>. First, cookies should be treated as <samp>SameSite=Lax</samp> by default. Second, cookies that explicitly assert <samp>SameSite=None</samp> in order to enable cross-site delivery should also be marked as <samp>Secure</samp>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The HTTP State Tokens proposal (<a href="#I-D.west-http-state-tokens">[I-D.west-http-state-tokens]</a>) aims to replace cookies with a state management mechanism that has better security and privacy properties. That proposal is somewhat aspirational: it’s going to take a long time to come to agreement on the exact contours of a cookie replacement, and an even longer time to actually do so.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">While we’re debating the details of a new state management primitive, it seems quite reasonable to reevaluate some aspects of the existing primitive: cookies. When we can find consensus on some aspect of HTTP State Tokens, we can apply those aspirations to cookies, driving incremental improvements to state management in the status quo.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">Based on conversations at <a href="#HTTP-Workshop-2019">[HTTP-Workshop-2019]</a> and elsewhere, I’d suggest that we have something like agreement on at least two principles:</p>


<ol>
<li>HTTP requests should not carry state along with cross-site requests by default (see Section 8.2 of <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a>).</li>
<li>HTTP requests should not carry state over non-secure channels (see Section 8.3 of <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a>, and <a href="#RFC7258">[RFC7258]</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">With those principles in mind, this document proposes two changes that seem possible to deploy in the near-term. User agents should:</p>


<ol>
<li>Treat the lack of an explicit <samp>SameSite</samp> attribute as <samp>SameSite=Lax</samp>. That is, the <samp>Set-Cookie</samp> value <samp>key=value</samp> will produce a cookie equivalent to <samp>key=value; SameSite=Lax</samp>. Cookies that require cross-site delivery can explicitly opt-into such behavior by asserting <samp>SameSite=None</samp> when creating a cookie.  <p> This is spelled out in more detail in <a href="#lax-default">Section 3.1</a>.</p></li>
<li>Require the <samp>Secure</samp> attribute to be set for any cookie which asserts <samp>SameSite=None</samp> (similar conceptually to the behavior for the <samp>__Secure-</samp> prefix). That is, the <samp>Set-Cookie</samp> value <samp>key=value; SameSite=None; Secure</samp> will be accepted, while <samp>key=value; SameSite=None</samp> will be rejected.  <p> This is spelled out in more detail in <a href="#require-secure">Section 3.2</a>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP&nbsp;14 <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a> <a href="#RFC8174">[RFC8174]</a> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">This document adjusts some syntax from <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a>, and in doing so, relies upon the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of <a href="#RFC5234">[RFC5234]</a>.</p>


<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">The processing algorithm in Section 5.3.7 of <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a> treats the absence of a <samp>SameSite</samp> attribute in a <samp>Set-Cookie</samp> header as equivalent to the presence of <samp>SameSite=None</samp>. Cookies are therefore available for cross-site delivery by default, and developers may opt-into more security by setting some other value explicitly. Ideally, we’d invert that such that developers who accepted the risks of cross-site delivery (see Section 8.2 of <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a>) could opt into them, while developers who didn’t make any explicit choice would be protected by default.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">We could accomplish this goal by first altering the processing algorithm, replacing the current step 1:</p>
<pre>1.  Let "enforcement" be "None".
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">with the following two steps:</p>
<pre>1.  Let "enforcement" be "Lax".

2.  If cookie-av's attribute-value is a case-insensitive
    match for "None", set "enforcement" to "None".
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.4">And then by, altering step 13 of the cookie storage model (Section 5.4 of <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a>) from:</p>
<pre>13. If the cookie-attribute-list contains an attribute
    with an attribute-name of "SameSite", set the cookie's
    same-site-flag to attribute-value (i.e. either "Strict",
    "Lax", or "None"). Otherwise, set the cookie's
    same-site-flag to "None".
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.5">to:</p>
<pre>13. If the cookie-attribute-list contains an attribute
    with an attribute-name of "SameSite", set the
    cookie's same-site-flag to attribute-value. Otherwise,
    set the cookie's same-site-flag to "Lax".
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.6">This would have the effect of mapping the default behavior in the absence of an explicit <samp>SameSite</samp> attribute, as well as the presence of any unknown <samp>SameSite</samp> value, to the “Lax” behavior, protecting developers by making cross-site delivery an explicit choice, as opposed to an implicit default.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">Cookies sent over plaintext HTTP are visible to anyone on the network. As section 8.3 of <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a> points out, this visibility exposes substantial amounts of data to network attackers.  We know, for example, that long-lived and stable cookies have enabled pervasive monitoring <a href="#RFC7258">[RFC7258]</a> in the past (see Google’s PREF cookie <a href="#pref-cookie">[pref-cookie]</a>), and we know that a secure transport layer provides significant confidentiality protections against this kind of attack.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">We can, to a reasonable extent, mitigate this threat by ensuring that cookies intended for cross-site delivery (and therefore likely to be more prevalent on the wire than cookies scoped down to same-site requests) require secure transport.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.3">That is, we can require that any cookie which asserts <samp>SameSite=None</samp> must also assert the <samp>Secure</samp> attribute (Section 4.1.2.5 of <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a>) by altering the storage model defined in Section 5.4 of <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a>, inserting the following step after the existing step 14:</p>
<pre>15. If the cookie's "same-site-flag" is "None", abort
    these steps and ignore the cookie entirely unless
    the cookie's secure-only-flag is true.
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.4">This is conceptually similar to the requirements put into place for the <samp>__Secure-</samp> prefix (Section 4.1.3.1 of <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a>).</p>


<p><samp>SameSite</samp> is a reasonably robust defense against some classes of cross-site request forgery attacks, as described in Section 8.8.1 of <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a>, but developers need to opt-into its protections in order for them to have any effect. That is, developers are vulnerable to CSRF attacks by default, and must do some work to shift themselves into a more defensible position.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">The change proposed in <a href="#lax-default">Section 3.1</a> would invert that requirement, placing the burden on the small number of developers who are building services that require state in cross-site requests.  Those developers would be empowered to opt-into the status quo’s less-secure model, while developers who don’t intend for their projects to be embedded in cross-site contexts are protected by default.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">As discussed in Section 8.3 of <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a>, cookies delivered over plaintext channels are exposed to intermediaries, and thereby enable pervasive monitoring <a href="#RFC7258">[RFC7258]</a>. The change proposed in <a href="#require-secure">Section 3.2</a> above would set secure transport as a baseline requirement for all stateful cross-site requests, thereby reducing the risk that these cookies can be cataloged or modified by network attackers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">Requiring secure transport for cookies intended for cross-site usage has the exciting secondary effect of increasing pressure on entities that produce embeddable content to migrate their products to HTTPS. That has security benefits for those third-party products themselves, but also has the effect of removing the potential of mixed content (<a href="#mixed-content">[mixed-content]</a>) as a blocker to first-party migration to HTTPS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">Note that in the long term, it seems quite reasonable to take the additional step of requiring the <samp>Secure</samp> attribute for all cookies, regardless of their <samp>SameSite</samp> value. That would have more substantial impact on pervasive monitoring and network attackers generally. This document’s proposal limits itself to <samp>SameSite=None</samp> because that seems like a low-hanging, high-value change that’s deployable in the near term. User agents are encouraged to find additional subsets for which <samp>Secure</samp> can be required.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">The proposals in this document do not in themselves mitigate the privacy risks described in Section 7.1 of <a href="#RFC6265bis">[RFC6265bis]</a>. Entities who wish to use cookies to track user activity from cross-site contexts can continue to do so by setting cookies that declare themselves as <samp>SameSite=None</samp>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">Requiring that explicit declaration, however, gives user agents the ability to easily distinguish cookies used for stateful cross-site requests from those with narrower scope. After the change proposed in <a href="#lax-default">Section 3.1</a>, only those cookies that make an explicit <samp>SameSite=None</samp> declaration can be directly used for cross-site tracking. It may make sense for user agents to use that information to give users different controls for these cookies, or to apply different policies for expiration and delivery.</p>


<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">The steps described in this document don’t need to be taken at the same time. It’s quite possible that it will be less disruptive to deploy <samp>SameSite=Lax</samp> as a default first, and then to require the <samp>Secure</samp> attribute for any explicitly <samp>SameSite=None</samp> cookie as a subsequent step.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">User agents are encouraged to adopt these recommendations in whatever order they believe will lead to the widest, most expedient deployment.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">It’s possible that a middle-ground between <samp>SameSite=Lax</samp> and <samp>SameSite=None</samp> could be a better balance between doing what developers want by default, and mitigating CSRF by default.  <a href="#I-D.west-cookie-samesite-firstparty">[I-D.west-cookie-samesite-firstparty]</a> explores the possibility of integrating First-Party Sets <a href="#first-party-set">[first-party-set]</a> with the <samp>SameSite</samp> attribute in order to allow entities that shard themselves across multiple registrable domains to maintain stateful communication between them (to support single-sign on, for example).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">It’s possible that user agents who support First-Party Sets could reduce the deployment overhead for developers, and increase the robustness of a site’s CSRF defense for cross-site-but-not-cross-party cookies by defaulting to something like that document’s <samp>FirstPartyLax</samp> instead of <samp>Lax</samp>.</p>
