<p>The questions we often hear are “Why create a new query language?” and
            “What’s wrong with SQL?”.  This post contains answers to both.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let’s overview some of the history of how the relational
            model came to be, and how SQL was created.</p>

<p>The relational model was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in a seminal 1970 paper
                “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” <span>[<a id="id1" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/#fcodd-1970">4</a>]</span>.
                There, Codd postulated that all data in a database can be represented in
                terms of sets of tuples, called <em>relations</em>. Codd also invented a form of
                first-order predicate logic to describe the database queries: <em>tuple
                    relational calculus</em>.</p>
<p>Codd’s ideas were revolutionary.  For the first time, a database,
                and a universal way to query it, was described in a succinct, consistent
                mathematical model.  This, naturally, created lots of interest in further
                research and, importantly, into practical implementation of the relational
                model.</p>
<p>In 1974 Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce published a paper
                <span>[<a id="id2" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/#fchamberlin-1974">2</a>]</span>, which introduced “a set of simple operations on tabular
                structures, […] of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus”.
                Chamberlin and Boyce felt that the formal relational query languages proposed
                at the time were too hard to understand for “users without formal training in
                mathematics or computer programming” and thought that the “predominant use of
                the language would be for ad-hoc queries” <span>[<a id="id3" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/#fchamberlin-2012">3</a>]</span>.  Initially,
                the authors did not consider SQL to be a “serious” language.  Nonetheless,
                the great interest in the commercial application of the relational model had
                pushed IBM to quickly adopt and productize SQL, which was also picked up by
                their quickly-rising competitor–Oracle.</p>
<p>IBM had an overwhelmingly large influence over the tech market at the time,
                so SQL became a de facto standard for relational databases, and then a proper
                standard with the publication of the first ANSI standard in 1989 that
                essentially circumscribed the most prominent existing implementations
                of SQL.  Subsequent versions of the standard continued to be primarily
                influenced by the commercial vendors.</p>
<p>Today, SQL is by far the most widely used database language.  But that does
                not necessarily mean that it represents the best of what we can do.
                In fact, SQL’s beginnings as a “simple, ad-hoc” language coupled with
                “design by implementation” from competing vendors had left the language with
                a baggage of severe issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="critique-of-sql">

<p>SQL, especially its earlier versions, was heavily criticized by the experts,
                including Codd himself <span>[<a id="id4" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span>, as well as C. J. Date, who published a
                multitude of papers and books on the subject (<span>[<a id="id5" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/#fdate-1985">7</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id6" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>,
                <span>[<a id="id7" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/#fdate-2009">10</a>]</span>).  While many of the early shortcomings were fixed in the later
                versions of the standard, some of the serious issues had been only further
                ingrained.</p>
<p>Some of the complaints here apply to SQL as a whole, while others are specific
                to a certain implementation.  We are primarily using PostgreSQL for the
                examples.</p>
<p>SQL’s shortcomings can be grouped into these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lack of proper orthogonality — SQL is hard to compose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of compactness — SQL is a large language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of consistency — SQL is inconsistent in syntax and semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>poor system cohesion — SQL does not integrate well enough with
                        application languages and protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div id="lack-of-orthogonality">

<p>Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set
                    of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways.
                    A language with good orthogonality is smaller, more consistent, and is
                    easier to learn due to there being few exceptions from the overall set of
                    rules.  Conversely, bad orthogonality leads to a large language with many
                    exceptions and caveats.</p>
<p>A good example of orthogonality in a programming language is the ability to
                    substitute an arbitrary part of an expression with a variable, or a function
                    call, without any effect on the final result.</p>
<p>In SQL, such generic substitution is not possible, since there are <em>two</em>
                    mutually incompatible kinds of expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>table expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a table:
                            <code>SELECT * FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>scalar expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a single scalar value:
                            <code>SELECT count(*) FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Table expressions can only be used in a <code>FROM</code> clause, in a function, or with
                    an operator that specifically expects a table expression as input.
                    What’s worse the scalar and table expressions may have exactly the same syntax,
                    which can be a source of further confusion.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine we needed to list the names of all department
                    heads in a company.  This query would do the job:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> name
<span>FROM</span> emp
<span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span></span></span></pre>
<p>Now let’s say we needed to add this bit to a larger query that extracts
                    information about a department.  An intuitive way is to simply add the
                    above as a subquery to the target list of our larger query:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> name <span>FROM</span> emp
     <span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span> <span>AND</span> deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>This is legal, but <em>only</em> if the subquery returns not more than one row.
                    Otherwise, an error would be raised at run time.  To account for multiple
                    department heads, we would need to rewrite the query using a join:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    head<span>.</span>name
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>INNER</span> <span>JOIN</span> emp <span>AS</span> head
        <span>ON</span> <span>(</span>head<span>.</span>deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span>
            <span>AND</span> head<span>.</span>role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The difference in structure is large enough to make any sort of source-level
                    query reuse impractical.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-compactness">

<div><p>Few claim that SQL is an elegant language characterized by orthogonality.
                        Some call it an elephant on clay feet.  With each addition, its body grows,
                        and it becomes less stable.  SQL standardization is largely the domain of
                        database vendors, not academic researchers without commercial interests
                        or users with user interests. <span>[<a id="id8" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/#fatzeni-2013">1</a>]</span></p><p>Paolo Atzeni et al.</p></div>
<p>SQL is not a small language. At the time of writing the PostgreSQL
                    implementation contains <b>469 keywords</b>. Just part 2 (out of 14) of the
                    SQL:2016 standard has <b>1732 pages</b>.</p>
<p>The main reason is that SQL, in line with its original goals, strives to be
                    an English-like language, catered to “non-professionals”.  However, with the
                    growth of the language, this verbosity has contributed <em>negatively</em> to the
                    ability to write and comprehend SQL queries.  We learnt this lesson with
                    COBOL, and the world has long since moved on to newer, more succinct
                    programming languages.</p>
<p>In addition to keyword proliferation, the orthogonality issues discussed
                    above make queries more verbose and harder to read.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-consistency">

<p>SQL is arbitrarily inconsistent both in its syntax and semantics. What
                    makes things even worse is that different databases have their own version
                    of SQL, often incompatible with other SQL variants.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of entirely different calling conventions in SQL:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span> <span>from</span> <span>8</span> <span>for</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 

<span>SELECT</span> trim<span>(</span>both <span>from</span> <span>'yxSQLxx'</span><span>,</span> <span>'xyz'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> extract<span>(</span><span>day</span> <span>from</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>'2001-02-16 20:38:40'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></span></pre>
<p>There are two syntaxes that specify the ordering of the input set in an
                    aggregate function:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> array_agg<span>(</span>foo <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> rank<span>(</span>foo<span>)</span> <span>WITHIN</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The list of inconsistencies like this does not end here and can be continued,
                    but that’s beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>

<div id="null-a-bag-of-surprises">

<div><p>In some cases of inadequate handling of missing information,
                        the problem is incorrectly perceived to be a problem of the
                        relational model. In fact, the problem stems from the inadequacies
                        of SQL and its non-conformance to the relational model. <span>[<a id="id9" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span></p><p>Edgar J. Codd</p></div>
<p>It has been extensively argued that <code>NULL</code> is the biggest misfeature of SQL
                    (<span>[<a id="id10" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/#fcodd-1987">5</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id11" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/#fdate-1986">8</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id12" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>).
                    In fact, the handling of <code>NULL</code> in contemporary SQL implementations is so
                    surprising, inconsistent, and dangerous that this topic deserves a separate
                    section.</p>
<p><code>NULL</code> is so special that it’s not equal to anything, including itself:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# select NULL = NULL;
 ?column?
----------

(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>In fact, almost any operation on <code>NULL</code> will return <code>NULL</code> and the
                    effect may be very subtle:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# CREATE TABLE x (a int, b text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# INSERT INTO x(a, b)
           VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (NULL, 'three')
           RETURNING a, b;
 a |   b
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
   | three
(3 rows)

postgres=# SELECT * FROM x WHERE a NOT IN (1, null);
 a | b
---+---
(0 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>But, in some cases <code>NULL</code>
<em>is</em> equal to itself, such as in <code>DISTINCT</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span>elvis=# SELECT DISTINCT *
        FROM (VALUES (1), (NULL), (NULL)) AS q;
 column1
---------

       1
(2 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>or <code>UNION</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span>elvis=# VALUES (1), (NULL) UNION VALUES (2), (NULL);
 column1
---------

       1
       2
(3 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>Much of the traditional logic and boolean algebra rules cannot be safely
                    applied to SQL boolean expressions in the presence of <code>NULL</code>.  For example,
                    the law of excluded middle, <em>p</em> OR NOT <em>p</em>, does not evaluate to true if <em>p</em>
                    is <code>NULL</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM x WHERE a = 1 OR a != 1;
 count
-------
     2
(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>Worse yet:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# SELECT
               b,
               CASE WHEN a = 1
               THEN 'one'
               ELSE 'not one'
               END
           FROM x;
   b   |  case
-------+---------
 one   | one
 two   | not one
 three | not one
(3 rows)

postgres=# SELECT
               b,
               CASE WHEN a != 1
               THEN 'not one'
               ELSE 'one'
               END
           FROM x;
   b   |  case
-------+---------
 one   | one
 two   | not one
 three | one
(3 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>The the row containing <code>b=3</code> is classified either as <code>'one'</code> or
                    <code>'not one'</code> even though the construction of the <code>CASE</code> expression
                    appears equivalent in both cases.</p>
<p>Rows containing <code>NULL</code> sometimes get counted, and sometimes not:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# SELECT count(a) FROM x;
 count
-------
     2
(1 row)

postgres=# SELECT cardinality(array_agg(a)) FROM x;
 cardinality
-------------
           3
(1 row)

postgres=# SELECT count(*) FROM x;
 count
-------
     3
(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>Rows containing <code>NULL</code> cannot be compared:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# SELECT (NULL, 1) = (NULL, 1);
 ?column?
----------

(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>And even <code>IS NULL</code> doesn’t work:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# SELECT (NULL, 1) IS NULL;
 ?column?
----------
 f
(1 row)

postgres=# SELECT (NULL, 1) IS NOT NULL;
 ?column?
----------
 f
(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>What’s worse, the databases often uses <code>NULL</code> to indicate an error condition,
                    so your query might contain <code>NULLs</code> even if you don’t expect them:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# SELECT (ARRAY[1, 2])[3];
 array
-------

(1 row)

postgres=# SELECT to_char(timestamp '2001-02-16 20:38:40', '');
 to_char
---------

(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>In PostgreSQL division by zero is an exception, whereas MySQL
                    simply returns <code>NULL</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span>mysql&gt; SELECT 1 / 0;
+-------+
| 1 / 0 |
+-------+
|  NULL |
+-------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)</span></span></pre>
<p>There are many more cases like these, and there is no consistency in a single
                    SQL implementation, let alone across all implementations.</p>

<p>OK, so we have highlighted the shortcomings of SQL.  Why do they matter?
                It’s all about <em>ergonomics</em>.  Orthogonality, compactness, and consistency

                programming languages.  Swift, Rust, Kotlin, Go, just to name a few, are
                great examples in the advancement of engineer ergonomics and productivity.
                But SQL, often hidden behind layers of ORMs and frameworks, is still very
                much the dominant data language.</p>
<p>The NoSQL movement was born, in part, out of the frustration with the
                perceived stagnation and inadequacy of SQL databases.  Unfortunately, in
                the pursuit of ditching SQL, the NoSQL approaches also abandoned the
                relational model and other <em>good</em> parts of RDBMSes.</p>
</div>
<div id="edgeql-query-language-evolution">

<p>The relational model is still the most generally applicable and effective
                method of representing data.  The concept of SQL as a declarative,
                storage-neutral query language is powerful and versatile.  We don’t need to
                abandon either.  What we <em>do</em> need is a “better SQL”: a query language that
                affords more power to its users, but that is also simpler and more consistent.</p>
<p>This is exactly what we are working hard to achieve with <b>EdgeQL</b>.  We spent
                years of research and development, focusing on usability and performance
                without compromising correctness.  In our <a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/edgedb-1-0-alpha-1/">earlier blog post</a>
                we described some of the great features of the language, but it’s worth
                getting into some detail here to highlight how we are solving the issues
                brought up in this post.</p>

<p>In EdgeQL <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/edgeql/overview#everything-is-a-set">every value is a set</a> and every expression is
                    a function over sets, returning a set.  This means that, syntactically, any
                    part of an EdgeQL expression can be factored out into a view or a function
                    without changing other parts of the query.</p>
<p>Consider a query returning movies together with the number of reviews for
                    each one:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> Movie {
    description,
    number_of_reviews <span>:=</span> <span>count</span>(.reviews)
};</span></span></pre>
<p>Let’s say we need the average number of reviews across all movies:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> math::<span>mean</span>(
    Movie {
        description,
        number_of_reviews <span>:=</span> <span>count</span>(.reviews)
    }.number_of_reviews
);</span></span></pre>
<p>Now we <em>also</em> need the maximum number of reviews per movie:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> (
    avg <span>:=</span> math::<span>mean</span>(
        Movie {
            number_of_reviews <span>:=</span> <span>count</span>(.reviews)
        }.number_of_reviews
    ),
    <span>max</span> <span>:=</span> <span>max</span>(
        Movie {
            number_of_reviews <span>:=</span> <span>count</span>(.reviews)
        }.number_of_reviews
    )
);</span></span></pre>
<p>This is a tad unwieldy, let’s make the query cleaner by factoring out the
                    <code>Movie</code> expression into a view:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>WITH</span>
    MovieReviewCount <span>:=</span> Movie {
        number_of_reviews <span>:=</span> <span>count</span>(.reviews)
    }
<span>SELECT</span> (
    avg <span>:=</span> math::<span>mean</span>(MovieReviewCount.number_of_reviews),
    <span>max</span> <span>:=</span> <span>max</span>(MovieReviewCount.number_of_reviews),
);</span></span></pre>
<p>Since everything is a function over sets, there are only a handful of keywords
                    in EdgeQL queries, and they are used mostly to delineate the major parts of a
                    query.</p>
</div>
<div id="missing-data">

<p>In EdgeQL, the notion of missing data is simple: it is always an empty set,
                    and any element-wise operation on an empty set is, likewise, an empty set:</p>
<div><div><div><pre>edgedb&gt; </pre><pre><span><span>SELECT</span> <span>True</span> <span>OR</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>{};</span></pre></div></div><div><div><pre>edgedb&gt; </pre><pre><span><span>SELECT</span> <span>True</span> <span>AND</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>{};</span></pre></div></div></div>
<p>Aggregation is consistent:</p>
<div><div><div><pre>edgedb&gt; </pre><pre><span><span>SELECT</span> <span>count</span>({});</span></pre></div></div><div><div><pre>edgedb&gt; </pre><pre><span><span>SELECT</span> <span>array_agg</span>(<span>&lt;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt;</span>{});</span></pre></div></div></div>
<p>In EdgeQL, sets are flat, i.e. a set (including an empty one) cannot be an
                    element of another set:</p>
<div><div><div><pre>edgedb&gt; </pre><pre><span><span>SELECT</span> {<span>1</span>, {<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>}, {}, {}};</span></pre></div></div></div>
<p>The set constructor notation above is actually equivalent to a <code>UNION</code>
                    operation, which better highlights its set nature:</p>
<div><div><div><pre>edgedb&gt; </pre><pre><span><span>SELECT</span> {<span>1</span>} <span>UNION</span> {<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>} <span>UNION</span> {} <span>UNION</span> {};</span></pre></div></div></div>
<p>An empty set can be coalesced into a non-empty set:</p>
<div><div><div><pre>edgedb&gt; 
....... </pre><pre><span><span>WITH</span> empty_set_expr <span>:=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>int64</span><span>&gt;</span>{}
<span>SELECT</span> empty_set_expr <span>??</span> {<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>};</span></pre></div></div><div><div><pre>edgedb&gt; 
....... </pre><pre><span><span>WITH</span> empty_set_expr <span>:=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>int64</span><span>&gt;</span>{}
<span>SELECT</span> {<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>} <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> empty_set_expr <span>ELSE</span> <span>42</span>;</span></pre></div></div></div>
</div>
<div id="system-integration">

<p>In EdgeDB, the data schema is formulated in a way that is
                    <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/tutorial/createdb#sdl">much closer</a> to the contemporary application data model.
                    This makes the database-application schema reflection straightforward and
                    efficient.</p>
<p>Unlike SQL, EdgeQL can easily extract arbitrary data trees:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> Movie {
    description,

    directors: {
        full_name,
        image,
    }
    <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> .last_name,

    <span>cast</span>: {
        full_name,
        image,
    }
    <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> .last_name,

    reviews <span>:=</span> (
        <span>SELECT</span> Movie<span>.&lt;</span>movie[<span>IS</span> Review] {
            body,
            rating,
            author: {
                name,
                image,
            }
        }
        <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> .creation_time <span>DESC</span>
    ),
};</span></span></pre>
<p>Coupled with extensive <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/datamodel/scalars/json#constructing-json-values">JSON support</a>, this makes writing
                    REST and <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/clients/99_graphql/index">GraphQL</a> backends an order of magnitude easier.</p>

<p>SQL started with a goal to empower non-programmers to work with the relational
                data effectively.  Despite its shortcomings, it has arguably been wildly
                successful, with most databases implementing or emulating it.  However, like
                any solution, SQL is facing increasing inadequacy in the support of the new
                requirements, modes of use and user productivity.  It is time we do
                something about it.</p>
