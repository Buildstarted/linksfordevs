I wrote up a known issue note for 3.1.0 at <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/3.1-known-issues.md#aspnet-core">https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/3.1-known-issues.md#aspnet-core</a>. (To point it out for this thread, it's only a branding issue. We expect no functional differences from having the "wrong" one installed. There is an issue with the Windows installers misbehaving if you try to replace the runtime with the correct one, also documented there.)</p><p>I'm not as sure about the bad blobs still on <code>dotnetcli</code> blob storage. We aren't currently tracking reuploading them--I'll try to confirm this was intentional with some folks. (IMO it seems the issue was fixed incorrectly because only a subset of the files were replaced, but I'll have to confirm.) There is no expected functional difference for most of those so I doubt they'll be reuploaded. The WindowsDesktop zips might be a special case because of the localization difference, I'll ask about those in particular.</p><blockquote><p>any reason why the packages in question havnt been de-listed?</p></blockquote><p>For what it's worth, the NuGet packages aren't affected. As for the installers/zips/etc., I don't think we identified a reason to delete them.</p></div></div></div></div>
