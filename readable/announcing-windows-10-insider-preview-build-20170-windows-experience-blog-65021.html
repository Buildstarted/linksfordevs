<h2><strong>Improving</strong><strong> your Sound Settings experience</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/07/01/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-20161/">Last week we mentioned</a> we were planning on bringing more Control Panel capabilities forward into Settings, and here’s another one – we’re updating Settings &gt; System &gt; Sound &gt; Manage sound devices to now let you know which device is default, and if not, enable you to set it as your default device or default communication device.</p>
<p>We’ve also updated the volume mixer to include a link to the per app audio settings, which you can use to redirect audio endpoints per app.</p>
<p>There is more work on the way in this area – stay tuned!</p>

<h2><strong>Improving search from the taskbar in Windows 10</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve recently unveiled two improvements to the search bar in Windows that make it even easier to find what you need.</p>
<p>Click on Search in the taskbar or press the Windows key + S to view an updated design for Search Home. A new two-column layout offers easy readability, as well as fast access to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/11/05/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-19018/">Quick Searches</a>, where you can see local weather, top news, and more helpful info. To find other web results or navigate directly to a website, just type in the search bar like normal.</p>
<p>The new layout is available in markets that enable Quick Searches, including the United States, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and the UK.</p>
<p>In addition, the Windows search bar now supports web search for Dutch-speaking customers in the Netherlands. Users with their Windows region set to Netherlands and their language set to Dutch can now search the web from their search bar without using a browser. Previously the feature was limited to English-speaking users in the region.</p>
<p>We welcome your feedback on these updates. You can share your comments by clicking the feedback button on Search Home.</p>
<p><a href="https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/07/915db5d2a3a79763f6f7e6be268aeddb.png"><img src="https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/07/915db5d2a3a79763f6f7e6be268aeddb.png" alt="Updated taskbar search experience in Windows 10." width="468" height="388" srcset="https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/07/915db5d2a3a79763f6f7e6be268aeddb.png 468w, https://46c4ts1tskv22sdav81j9c69-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/07/915db5d2a3a79763f6f7e6be268aeddb-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px"></a></p>
<p>Note: This is a server-side rollout and will be visible to those running Windows 10 version 1809 up to the latest Dev Channel build.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/insidersdk">Windows SDK</a> is now flighting continuously with the Dev Channel. Whenever a new OS is flighted to the Dev Channel, the corresponding SDK will also be flighted. You can always install the latest Insider SDK from <a href="https://aka.ms/InsiderSDK">aka.ms/InsiderSDK</a>. SDK flights will be archived in <a href="https://aka.ms/flighthub">Flight Hub</a> along with OS flights.</p>

<li>As part of our ongoing efforts <a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/iconic-icons-designing-the-world-of-windows-5e70e25e5416">to update the iconography across Windows</a>, Insiders will notice we’re introducing a new Settings icon in this build. The new Settings icon looks great on the Start menu with the theme-aware tiles <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/07/01/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-20161/">introduced in Build 20161</a>!<br>

<li>While we work on improving reliability, we’re temporarily turning off Notepad’s ability to persist open windows across restarts and updates.</li>
<li>An experimental implementation of Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 is enabled by default starting with Insider Preview Build 20170. IIS/HTTP.SYS have TLS 1.3 enabled by default. SSPI callers can use TLS 1.3 by passing the new crypto-agile <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/schannel/ns-schannel-sch_credentials">SCH_CREDENTIALS</a> structure when calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/acquirecredentialshandle--schannel">AcquireCredentialsHanlde</a>. SSPI callers using TLS 1.3 need to make sure their code correctly handles <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/recognizing-a-request-to-renegotiate-a-connection">SEC_I_RENEGOTIATE</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>We fixed an issue resulting in some Insiders finding that their screens became dimmer after upgrading to the last few builds.</li>
