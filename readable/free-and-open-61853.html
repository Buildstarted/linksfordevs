<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Do you have a question that isn't answered here? Please <a href="https://defold.com/contact/#open-source">ask us</a> and we will do our best to answer!</p><div><div><div><h5>Q: Is Defold still owned by King?</h5>
			<p>A: No, Defold has been donated to the <a href="https://defold.com/foundation">Defold Foundation</a>. King holds a single seat on the Defold board but has no direct influence on the future of Defold.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: Has King abandoned Defold?</h5>
			<p>A: No, King is still using Defold for selected live games.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: Who is working on Defold?</h5>
			<p>A: Defold is still being worked on by members of the Defold team. The team has plans to grow during 2020 but as with any open project it will also to some extent rely on community contributions. Learn more about <a href="https://defold.com/contribute">how to contribute here</a>.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: Who pays for Defold development?</h5>
			<p>A: King made a generous donation when the <a href="https://defold.com/foundation">Defold Foundation</a> was created. Defold will fund continued development from the initial donation and through community donations and corporate partnership deals. Learn more about <a href="https://defold.com/donate">how to donate</a>.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: Will the quality of Defold degrade now that it is open and accepting community contributions?</h5>
			<p>A: No. We will never compromise on code quality. We will only accept contributions that have been reviewed by the team, and we will impose the same high standards on community contributions as contributions made by the core team. We will also not accept contributions that aren't in line with our roadmap. Learn more about <a href="https://defold.com/contribute">how to contribute here</a>.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: Will we still have a stable engine that is kept up to date with the latest platform requirements for iOS, Android and more?</h5>
			<p>A: Yes. The <a href="https://defold.com/foundation">Defold Foundation</a> will always focus on maintaining a stable and up to date engine. The main responsibility of keeping the engine and editor updated falls on the Defold Foundation, but we may from time to time ask for help from the community.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: Will the native extension build servers be shut down?</h5>
			<p>A: No. We believe the native extension build servers to be such an integral part of the Defold product offering that they should remain available as a free service to our users. And now that the <a href="https://www.github.com/defold/extender" target="_blank">build server source code is available</a> anyone is free to set up and run their own server, either locally or as a public or private server.</p>
		</div></div>

<div><div><h5>Q: Can the community influence the roadmap?</h5>
			<p>A: This is definitely something we want to happen. Earlier this year we communicated the high level roadmap for 2020 and we will plan our work based on this roadmap. But since the roadmap is defined on a high level there is a possibility for the community to influence the work. With reported issues, feature requests and task now being public on GitHub it will be possible for the community to upvote items they feel are important, and we will take the votes into account when we plan our work.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: Are you planning to create a Defold marketplace?</h5>
			<p>A: We currently have the <a hrerf="/assets">Asset Portal</a> where users can share content with the community. We do not have any plans to create a marketplace where assets can be sold / bought. You are however free to use the Asset Portal to market your content and explain how the content can be purchased.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: What license is used for Defold?</h5>
			<p>A: Defold is released under a permissive license derived from the popular Apache 2.0 License. The license grants you the freedom to develop games without worrying about paying licensing fees or royalties on your earnings. Learn more about <a href="https://defold.com/license">the license here</a>.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: Is using an open game engine safe for my projects?</h5>
			<p>A: Yes, absolutely! Defold is much more future proof this way. The fact that Defold source code is available will allow anyone to improve Defold by fixing bugs, updating it with new features or patching it to work with new operating system updates without being dependent on another company to do the work.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: What parts of source code for the Defold product is available?</h5>
			<p>A: All of it. The engine and editor source code is available from <a href="https://www.github.com/defold/defold" target="_blank">this GitHub repository</a>. The native extension build server is available from <a href="https://www.github.com/defold/extender" target="_blank">this GitHub repository</a>. Extensions and other miscellaneous projects are also open sourced <a href="https://www.github.com/defold" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: Where do I find more information about the Defold source code and open contribution activity?</h5>
			<p>A: The basic information about why and how Defold source code is available can be found on our <a href="https://defold.com/open" target="_blank">webpage</a>. The daily development process can be followed on <a href="https://www.github.com/defold" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. To participate in source code discussions please join the <a href="https://defold.com/slack" target="_blank">#opensource Slack channel</a> or the <a href="https://defold.com/forum" target="_blank">Open Source section</a> of our forum.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: This is great! I want to contribute! Where do I start?</h5>
			<p>A: Fantastic! Learn more about <a href="https://defold.com/contribute">how to contribute here</a>.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: I would like to contribute but I don't know C/C++ or Clojure so I can't help with the engine and editor. Can I help out some other way?</h5>
			<p>A: You don't need to know C/C++ or Clojure to help out. We would be thrilled if we received contributions to our documentation, examples and tutorials. Learn more about <a href="https://defold.com/contribute">how to contribute here</a>.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: Does this mean that you will rely on the community for most of the new features?</h5>
			<p>A: No. The <a href="https://defold.com/foundation">Defold Foundation</a> will have a team of developers working on the engine, but the team will initially be smaller. We believe that some members from our community would be interested in contributing.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: Will you be hiring?</h5>
			<p>A: Not initially. We want the funding we have to last for as long as possible and we don't want to hire more developers until we know we have enough donations and money from corporate sponsorships to support more people.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: I do not have the time to contribute new code to the engine but I would be more than happy to contribute financially. Can I do this?</h5>
			<p>A: Yes, absolutely. We accept donations via Patreon, PayPal and GitHub Sponsors. Learn more about <a href="https://defold.com/donate">how to donate</a>.</p>
		</div></div>
<div><div><h5>Q: The Defold community is quite small. Are you sure there are enough people that can and are willing to contribute? And what will you do to increase the number of users?</h5>
			<p>A: We have not focused on user growth in previous years. Despite this the Defold community has grown year over year, a fact which we are very proud of. We will work actively to grow the Defold community in 2020 to better sustain Defold as an open project. We do believe that the move to make the source code for Defold available and open to contributions will attract new developers and we hope that some of those developers would also be interested in contributing.</p>
