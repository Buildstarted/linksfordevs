<h3>
<strong>What's a sprint?</strong>
</h3>
<p>A sprint is an in-person or virtual event where community members can contribute to the Blazor project, with the help of Blazor maintainers.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Who can participate in the sprint?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Participation is open to anyone with experience developing C# and familiarity with Blazor.</p>
<h3>
<strong>What should I do to prepare?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Read through this documents which outlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to set up your development environment</li>
<li>a walk through of the Blazor codebase</li>
<li>the criteria for a pull request submission</li>
<li>issues available to work on</li>
</ul>
<p>It's recommended that you read through the first three sections before the day of the event to get familiar with the process and expectations. You can review the first section to identify issues to work on.</p>
<h3>
Where should I go for help?</h3>
<p>In addition to asking questions on the GitHub issue or pull request you are working on, you can ask questions on <a href="https://gitter.im/aspnet/Blazor" rel="nofollow">the Blazor Gitter</a>.</p>
<h3>
What happens after my PR is merged?</h3>
<p>Once your pull request has been successfully implemented, reviewed, and merge it'll ship in an upcoming release of .NET. To figure out what release your PR will ship in, you can check the "Milestone" attribute on the PR to determine the version it will be released under. You'll receive a shout-out on the release blog post for that version.</p>
<p>Sometimes, your pull request might contain a new feature or major change that cannot be shipped in an upcoming release, such as an RC. In that case, your pull request may be closed. Don't worry though, it'll be re-opened and your commits will be reused in the event that we decide to take up the feature for a later release.</p>
<h3>
What kind of help will mentors provide during the sprint?</h3>
<p>Mentors are available to help you set up your development environment, guide you if you are stuck debugging, help out with the design process, and more. During the sprint, mentors will be focusing on helping participants who are working on pull requests. If you need help with a general Blazor issue or have an unrelated bug to discuss, please open an issue in this repo.</p>

<p>To get started contributing to Blazor, you will need to build the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore">ASP.NET Core repo</a> locally.</p>
<p>Some pre-requisites that you will need before getting started:</p>
<ul>
<li>A development machine with reasonable specs to build a multi-project solution</li>
<li>Visual Studio or VS Code</li>
<li>git</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Begin by cloning the dotnet/aspnetcore repo (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore">https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore</a>) to your local machine.</li>
<li>Install the pre-requisites need to build a repo by following these instructions (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/docs/BuildFromSource.md#install-pre-requisites">https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/docs/BuildFromSource.md#install-pre-requisites</a>).</li>
<li>Take advantage of the install scripts located in the <code>eng/scripts</code> directory for installing Visual Studio, the JDK, and Google Chrome if they are not already installed on your machine.</li>
<li>Blazor's sources are locating in the <code>src/Components</code> directory. See the "Project conventions and source map" section for more info.</li>
</ol>

<p>Blazor's sources are located in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore">https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore</a> along with the rest of the ASP.NET Core's sources in a mono repo. Here is a map of the Blazor's sources:</p>
<p>/src/Components</p>
<p>+---Analyzers</p>
<p>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Analyzers - Roslyn analyzers for Components.</p>
<p>+---Authorization</p>
<p>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Authorization - Authentication and authorization support for Blazor applications.</p>
<p>+---Components</p>

<p>Seleniun based integration tests</p>
<p>¦ +---testassets</p>
<p>¦ +---BasicTestApp</p>
<p>Test app used in the integration tests. You'd likely add additonal end-to-end tests to this project.</p>
<p>+---Web</p>
<p>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web - Contains form and input components, browser events etc</p>
<p>+---Web.JS</p>
<p>Typescript project that produces blazor.server.js and blazor.webassembly.js</p>
<p>+---WebAssembly</p>

<p>+---WebAssembly</p>
<p>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly - WebAssembly hosting model implementation</p>
<p>+---WebAssembly.Authentication</p>
<p>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication - Authentication support for Blazor WebAssembly applications</p>
<p>When using Visual Studio for your development, use the Components.sln or Components.NoDeps.slnf file. It should load all the projects you would need to contribute to Blazor.</p>
<p>Building ASP.NET Core requires exact versions of the .NET Core SDK. Running build.cmd or build.sh will install the SDK in the $Repo_Root/.dotnet directory. In addition, build artifacts including binaries and packages produced from building projects are written to the the $Repo_Root/artifacts directory.</p>
<p>By default, running the build[cmd|sh] will only compile code without running tests. To run tests, use build[cmd|sh] -test. Running these commands in the Components directory will only run tests for the Blazor parts of the product. For most contributions this should suffice.</p>
<p>When contributing code, here are some here are some conventions to keep in mind</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the formatting adheres to our editor config</li>
<li>Make sure that tests properly dispose of resources</li>
<li>Verify that the code compiles and tests run.</li>
<li>Follow our coding guidelines as listed here: <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/wiki/Engineering-guidelines#coding-guidelines">https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/wiki/Engineering-guidelines#coding-guidelines</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md">https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md</a>
</li>
<li>When making changes to a public API surface, follow the instructions listed in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/docs/ReferenceAssemblies.md">https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/docs/ReferenceAssemblies.md</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding an issue to work on</p>
<p>Before starting work, it's worth making sure that your change is likely to be accepted. We recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li>In most cases, it's best to find an existing issue to work on. Try looking at the lists of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea-blazor+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">good first issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea-blazor+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">help wanted</a>. When you find one you'd like to work on, post a message to the issue saying you're getting started to be sure you're not duplicating effort with others.</li>
<li>If you want to work on something that has no existing issue, or the existing issue isn't labelled <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea-blazor+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">help wanted</a>, then please contact someone on the Blazor team to check whether it's an area we're ready to accept changes in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before starting to write code</p>
<p>If you're going to do a meaningful amount of work on an issue, or if your contribution will involve any changes to Blazor's public APIs, you should first post a description of your planned approach on the issue and speak with a Blazor team member about it.</p>
<p>All merged contributions will end up in many thousands of projects and will run on millions of end-user machines. Any APIs you add will have to be supported by Microsoft for many years. We have to be sure that it's secure, will perform well, will make sense to other developers, and fits in with longer-term plans for how the framework should evolve. That's why we're very careful about what gets added! Since you're also invested in the long-term success of Blazor, we hope you agree with these goals.</p>
<p>Example of an ideal contribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>You find an existing issue with the "help-wanted" label or discuss with the Blazor team to agree on adding a new issue with that label</li>
<li>You post a high-level description of how it will be implemented, and receive a positive acknowledgement from the team before getting too committed to the approach or investing too much effort implementing it</li>
<li>You add test coverage following existing patterns within the codebase</li>
<li>Your code matches the existing syntax conventions within the codebase</li>
<li>Your PR is small, focused, and avoids making unrelated changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of problematic contributions that are unlikely to be accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes that break backward compatibility</li>
<li>Changes that are only wanted by one person/company. Changes need to benefit a large enough proportion of all Blazor developers.</li>
<li>Changes that add entirely new feature areas without prior agreement</li>
<li>Changes that are mostly about refactoring existing code or code style</li>
<li>Very large PRs that would take hours to review (remember, we're trying to help lots of people at once). For larger work areas, please discuss with us to find ways of breaking it down into smaller, incremental pieces that can go into separate PRs.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get started, you'll need to find an issue you're interested in working in. Issues that are available for community contribution are labeled with the "help wanted" tag on GitHub. <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea-blazor+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">This GitHub query</a> lists all the issues that are available to work on.</p>
<p>To get started with contributing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up your development environment based on the instructions above.</li>
<li>Find an issue in the query above that you are interested in working in.</li>
<li>Post a GitHub comment on the issue saying you're interested in working on it.</li>
<li>Mention the mentor assigned to the issue in the comment.</li>
<li>If you have some ideas on how a particular issue should be resolved, post these ideas in the comment.</li>
<li>If you have some questions about the issue, add these as well.</li>
<li>If your issue doesn't require any design work, this is where the coding starts.</li>
<li>If your issue does require some design work, you should find your mentor on the Team's channel to flesh out elements of the design before coding.</li>
<li>Code up your PR keeping the guidelines above in mind.</li>
<li>Submit the PR for review and mention your mentor in the open PR.</li>
</ol>
