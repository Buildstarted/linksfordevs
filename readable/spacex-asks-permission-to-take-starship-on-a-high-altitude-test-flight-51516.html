<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-spmark="social-content"><p>I’ve had some experience with this.A few years ago, I was helping a customer with one of our parts that was going to be used in a wearable device. The customer said that sometimes the voice assistant simply quit working, and they were fairly confident that it was a problem with the part. We couldn’t find anything wrong on our end, but we didn’t have the full prototype device.Eventually, the customer discovered that the assistant was malfunctioning only in certain rooms, and the source was found to be the ultrasonic occupancy sensors mounted on the ceilings. The ultrasonic sound was being folded back into the audio frequency range, and the huge tones were affecting the voice data.There wasn’t anything we could do to fix our current part, but the customer solved the issue by putting a low-pass filter on the microphone path. Our newer parts have the filtering built in.Even when the wearables’ voice assistant was failing, a human could still understand the audio. You could hear a constant tone, but it was just a nuisance. Humans can figure out noisy speech better than a computer can.This could certainly make Siri or Alexa confused, but it wouldn’t “jam” cellphones or prevent audio recordings. At least not from a bracelet. I’m not saying it couldn’t be done, but you would need to flood the whole audio frequency range with huge amount of volume in order to render communication unusable.Plus, manufactures have been aware of this for a while, and they can prevent it.</p></div></div></div>
