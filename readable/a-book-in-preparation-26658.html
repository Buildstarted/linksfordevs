<p>I've started writing a book on applied cryptography at the beginning of 2019, and I will soon release a <strong>pre-access version</strong>. I will talk about that soon on this blog!</p>

<p>The book's audience is for students, developers, product managers, engineers, security consultants, curious people, etc. It tries to avoid the history of cryptography (which seems to be unavoidable in any book about cryptography these days), and shy away from mathematical formulas. Instead, it relies heavily on diagrams! A lot of them! As such, it is a broad introduction to what is useful in cryptography and how one can use the different primitives if seen as <strong>black boxes</strong>. It attempts to also serve the right amount of details, to satisfy the reader's curiosity. I'm hopping for it to be a good book for quickly getting introduced to different concepts going from TLS to PAKE. It will also include more modern topics like post-quantum cryptography and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>I don't think there's anything like this yet. the classic <strong>Applied Cryptography</strong> is quite old now and did not do much to encourage best practices or discourage rolling your own. The excellent <strong>Serious Cryptography</strong> is more technical and has more depth than what I'm aiming for. My book will rather be something in between, or something that would (hopefully) look like <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/">Matthew Green's blog</a> if it was a book (minus a lot of the humor, because I suck at making jokes).</p>
<p>More to come!</p>
