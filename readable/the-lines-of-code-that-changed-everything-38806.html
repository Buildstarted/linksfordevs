  Back in 2009, Facebook launched a world-changing piece of code—the “like” button. “Like” was the brainchild of several programmers and designers, including Leah Pearlman and Justin Rosenstein. They’d hypothesized that Facebook users were often too busy to leave comments on their friends’ posts—but if there were a simple button to push, boom: It would unlock a ton of uplifting affirmations. “Friends could validate each other with that much more frequency and ease,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nwSjRA3kQA">as Pearlman later said</a>.
</p>

  It worked—maybe a little too well. By making “like” a frictionless gesture, by 2012 we’d mashed it more than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/4/3453350/facebook-one-billion-monthly-users-announcement">1 trillion times</a>, and it really did unlock a flood of validation. But it had unsettling side effects, too. We’d post a photo, then sit there refreshing the page anxiously, waiting for the “likes” to increase. We’d wonder why someone <em>else</em> was getting more likes. So we began <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/2/15/16038024/how-the-like-button-took-over-the-internet-ebe778be2459">amping up the voltage</a> in our daily online behavior: trying to be funnier, more caustic, more glamorous, more extreme.

  Code shapes our lives. As the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has written, “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software is eating the world</a>,” though at this point it’s probably more accurate to say software is <em>digesting</em> it.

  Culturally, code exists in a nether zone. We can <em>feel</em> its gnostic effects on our everyday reality, but we rarely <em>see</em> it, and it’s quite inscrutable to non-initiates. (The folks in Silicon Valley like it that way; it helps them self-mythologize as wizards.) We construct top-10 lists for movies, games, TV—pieces of work that shape our souls. But we don’t sit around compiling lists of the world’s most consequential bits of code, even though they arguably inform the zeitgeist just as much.

  So Slate decided to do precisely that. To shed light on the software that has tilted the world on its axis, the editors polled computer scientists, software developers, historians, policymakers, and journalists. They were asked to pick: Which pieces of code had a huge influence? Which ones warped our lives? About 75 responded with all sorts of ideas, and Slate has selected 36. It’s not a comprehensive list—it couldn’t be, given the massive welter of influential code that’s been written. (One fave of mine that didn’t make the cut: “<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/">Quicksort</a>”! Or maybe Ada Lovelace’s <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/18/ada-lovelace-note-g.html">Bernoulli algorithm</a>.) Like all lists, it’s meant to provoke thought—to help us ponder anew how code undergirds our lives and how decisions made by programmers ripple into the future.

  There’s code you’ve probably heard of, like HTML. Other code is powerful (like Monte Carlo simulations, which is used to model probabilities) but totally foreign to civilians. Some contain deadly mistakes, like the flaw in the Boeing 737 Max. And some are flat-out creepy, like the tracking pixel that lets marketers know whether you’ve opened an email.

  One clear trend illustrated here: The most consequential code often creates new behaviors by removing friction. When software makes it easier to do something, we do more of it. The 1988 code that first created “Internet Relay Chat” allowed the denizens of the early internet to text-chat with one another in real time. Now real-time text is everywhere, from eye-glazingly infinite workplace Slack confabs to the riot of trolling and countertrolling in a Twitch livestream.

  It’s not always clear at first when some code will become epoch-defining. Oftentimes it starts off as a weird experiment, a trial balloon. Back in 1961, <em>Spacewar!</em>, the first virally popular video game, might have seemed a pretty frivolous way to use a cabinet-size computer that cost, at the time, $120,000. (That’s more than $1 million in 2019 dollars.) But it pioneered many of the concepts that helped computers go mainstream: representing data as icons, allowing users to manipulate those icons with handheld controllers.

<strong>Binary Punch Cards</strong><br><strong>Date: 1725</strong><br><strong><em>The first code</em></strong>

  Binary programming long predates what we think of as computers. Basile Bouchon is believed to be the first person to punch holes into paper and use it to control a machine: In 1725, he invented a loom that <a href="http://cs-exhibitions.uni-klu.ac.at/index.php?id=315">wove its patterns</a> based on the instructions provided in the perforated paper it was fed. A punched hole is the “one,” and the absence of a punched hole is the “zero.” As much as things have changed since then, the essential building block of code has not. —<em>Elena Botella, Slate</em>

  The Electrical Numerical Integrator and Computer was the first programmable electronic computer. Completed in 1945, it was configured for each new problem by wiring connections between its many components. When one task, such as an addition, finished, a pulse triggered the next. But a few years later, Klára Dán von Neumann and Los Alamos scientist Nicholas Metropolis wired ENIAC to run the first modern code ever executed on any computer: hundreds of numerical instructions executed from an addressable read-only memory (<a href="https://ftp.arl.army.mil/ftp/historic-computers/gif/eniac9.gif">ENIAC’s function table switches</a>). They simulated the explosion of several atomic bomb designs being evaluated at Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico, using the <a href="http://eniacinaction.com/docs/MonteCarloCode.pdf">Monte Carlo</a> technique by which a complex system is simulated, step by virtual step, to repeatedly map the probability distribution of possible outcomes. Von Neumann and Metropolis sent more than 20,000 cards back to the nuclear scientists at Los Alamos, tracing the progress of simulated neutrons through detonating warheads. The distant descendants of this code are still in use at Los Alamos today. —<em>Thomas Haigh, co-author of&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262033984/?tag=slatmaga-20" data-amzn-asin="0262033984">ENIAC in Action: Making and Remaking the Modern Computer</a>

  Grace Hopper was programming an early computer when she decided to make the whole thing easier by rooting it in human language. Hopper, who enlisted in the US Naval Reserve during World War II, knew that people like her superiors in the military struggled to understand binary code. If programming languages could be English-based, the work would be less prone to errors and more accessible to those who didn’t have a Ph.D. in mathematics.

  Some scoffed at the idea, but by the early 1950s she had devised a compiler—a set of instructions that converts a more intelligible kind of code to the lower-level code directly processed by the machine. With that tool, she and her lab developed FLOW-MATIC, the first programming language to incorporate English words based on that process. <em>—Molly Olmstead, Slate</em>

  In late 1961 a group of young MIT employees, students, and associates (many of them members of the Tech Model Railroad Club) gained late-night access to a recently donated DEC PDP-1 computer. The leading edge of nonmilitary computing, the PDP-1 sold for $120,000 (that would be a bit more than $1 million today), featured 18-bit word length, and used paper tape for program storage. Over the course of five months, these programmers created a game in which two players control spaceships—the needle and the wedge—that engage in a one-on-one space battle while avoiding the gravity well of a star at center screen.

  <em>Spacewar!</em> spread quickly across the early “hacker” community. It was later distributed by DEC with each PDP-1, preloaded in the core memory and ready to demonstrate when installed. The program significantly influenced the small coding community of the 1960s and inspired generations of video game creators. It <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eePWlLKm_Bg">lives on in emulations</a> and is demonstrated regularly at the Computer History Museum on the last operational PDP-1. Steve Russell, the lead coder, said at a 2018 Smithsonian panel, “It’s more than 50 years old. There are no outstanding user complaints. There are no crash reports. And support is still available.” <em>—Arthur Daemmrich, director, Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation</em>

  In 1961, Massachusetts Institute of Technology hackers created a system to let multiple users log into the same computer, and they began leaving little messages for each other. In 1965, a group of coders decided to create a formal command system for sending, receiving, and displaying these little digital missives. Higher-ups resisted the “MAIL” command at first, thinking it was a bit frivolous, but its usage took off—so much so that by 1971, MIT even saw the first piece of spam: an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324482504578454960570233222">anti–Vietnam War message</a>. —<em>Clive Thompson</em>

  When President Lyndon Johnson formed the President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice in 1965, he asked it to examine how computers could help us solve the nation’s “crime problem”—a problem he and the commission defined as both “urban” and “black.” The answer to this call was the <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d4a1/2e6df361ba43d72a9b0a594f1f5a17ad340f.pdf%20It">Police Beat Algorithm</a>, which aimed to solve planning problems like how many officers should patrol a given area of a city. By combining the PBA with a crime database, police officials could produce automated suspect profiles based on the racial demographics of police beats and deploy resources (officers, weapons, and other equipment) accordingly—before any crime was actually committed. Today’s predictive policing practices disproportionately <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">surveil and criminalize</a> black and brown people.

  That limited power and storage space meant that tasks had to be carefully managed so the AGC was always focused on the most important jobs. If it ran out of space to perform tasks, that wouldn’t happen. The AGC software team knew there were eventualities they couldn’t plan for. So they created BAILOUT. When the computer was at risk of running out of space (or “overflow”), the AGC triggered BAILOUT to schedule less important data and operations so it could keep the vital ones up and running.

  As the Eagle lander descended toward the moon’s surface, at 30,000 feet the AGC flashed a “1202” alarm, which neither Neil Armstrong nor the flight controller in Houston immediately recognized. But in less than 30 seconds, the computer experts in Mission Control relayed that the AGC software was doing just what it was supposed to: drop lower-priority work and restart the important jobs (so quickly that it was imperceptible to the crew). Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin would continue to get what they absolutely needed from the AGC to keep on the path to touchdown.

  When you sit down to learn a new programming language, the first thing the tutorial has you do is get the computer to display the phrase “Hello, world!” Perhaps the most famous early example comes from a Bell Laboratories memorandum called “Programming in C—A Tutorial,” written in 1974, though it was also found in a 1972 manual for another language, B, and may go back even earlier than that.

  <em>Hello, World!</em> is a beautiful bit of pedagogy. It’s a small, achievable task that offers an early sense of accomplishment. It’s a standard, so it helps illustrate the differences between different programming languages. It’s also a quick and easy way for advanced programmers to make sure everything is working correctly after installing a new environment. (Sometimes programmers use “time to ‘hello world’ ” as a speed test to compare languages and environments.) Perhaps most importantly, “Hello, world!” is doe-eyed, friendly, and helps convey the scale at which the new programmer’s code can have an effect.

  In 1972, Dennis Ritchie made a fateful decision: to represent text in his new language with something called a null-terminated string. The concept had been around earlier, but he enshrined it in his new language, which he called C, and the legacy of that decision has been with us ever since.

  There are two primary ways that programming languages represent a piece of text: It can have an intrinsic, explicit length—“I contain exactly 10 characters and no more.” Or it can be null-terminated—“Here are a bunch of characters, keep going until you hit the zero-byte at the end, good luck!”

  Besides merely causing the program to malfunction, such bugs can be exploited to change a program’s behavior by convincing it to overwrite something with specific, carefully crafted data.

  You can code carefully in C to avoid these kinds of bugs, but the language makes this class of mistake easy to make and hard to detect.

As ARPANET expanded within the government, its creators realized the technology could be valuable to the general public—and how much money could be made in the game. In August 1975, the commercial version of ARPANET, Telenet, went online in seven cities, allowing its earliest customers—mostly computer or database companies—to dial in with their telephones to upload and download data, like proto email messages, or remotely access code stored on a central computer. While ARPANET is often credited with being the earliest version of the modern internet, it might be more accurate to say that Telenet, a service designed for public consumption, is really the web’s precursor. In fact, one of Telenet’s biggest customers in the 1980s was Quantum Link—which later became AOL. <em>—Jane C. Hu, Future Tense contributor</em>

  In early 1982, the Vancouver Stock Exchange unveiled an electronic stock index initially pegged to a value of 1,000 points. In two years it dropped to half its original value—a confusing trend amid the bull market of the early 1980s. An investigation revealed that the calculations of the index were wrong in just one command, using floor() rather than round(). This command meant that instead of rounding to the third decimal place, the value was being truncated. (Digital computers necessarily have finite resolution, which necessitates rounding or truncation.) So if the index was calculated as 532.7528, it was stored as 532.752, rather than rounded up to 532.753. Over the course of thousands of calculations a day, this seemingly minor difference—essentially rounding down every single time—amounted to a dramatic loss in value. The programming mistake was finally fixed in November 1983, after the index closed around 500 on a Friday. It reopened on Monday at over 1,000, its lost value restored. <em>—Lav Varshney, assistant professor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</em>

  Internet Relay Chat, better known as IRC, began before most people could even tell you what an internet is. It was the first popular way to chat in real time with other people in a group channel. Early users logged on to share news, for example, during the 1991 coup d’état attempt in the Soviet Union during a media blackout. Chatting itself required a sort of code: To join a channel, you type “/join #[channel name].” (This will look familiar to today’s Slack addicts.) If you wanted to signal something about yourself, you’d type “/me is so tired,” and it’d share your name with the words “so tired” by an asterisk. It’s basic, but for many, it was the first brush with using a command on a computer. And it was a ticket to join the conversation. —<em>April Glaser, Slate</em>

  We take it for granted that we can fill our cameras with massive numbers of photos. But images used to require huge amounts of data. In 1992, the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/JPEG">Joint Photographic Experts Group</a> published specifications for a standard—the JPEG—to make image files smaller. Though other compression formats were available at the time, the JPEG became the worldwide standard, in part because it was royalty-free. JPEGs take advantage of lossy compression, a process that removes aspects of a picture undetectable to the human eye, such as slight variations in color. Lossy compression was also essential to the invention of something else introduced in 1992: the MP3, an audio file format made possible by discarding bits of data undetectable to the human ear. —<em>Aaron Mak, Slate</em>

The Mosaic hackers, led by Marc Andreessen, wanted a browser that laid out images and text side by side. They made the web look familiar, as if it were a cool digital zine or newspaper.

In 1993, companies started capitalizing on this: By tracking pixel downloads, they learned who and where you were, and triggered a cookie to be downloaded to your browser. That cookie enabled advertisers to follow you across multiple sites.

  Pixel tracking’s success led directly to the Facebook “like” button, which tracks you across <em>every</em> website where it’s embedded. This massive data collection enabled the hyper-targeting that made Facebook ads so successful, shifting billions in revenues away from media companies. As journalism flailed, targeted misinformation thrived—and surveillance-based business models proliferated.

  If you’ve ever run a Google search, there’s a chance you’ve bumped into a result that says, “A description for this result is not available because of this site’s robots.txt.” Not everyone wants their website to be indexed by a search engine, which is one reason a robots.txt file can be added to a website to ask the bots that catalog the web—sometimes called spiders or crawlers—to move along rather than access that site. Its unusual role of mediating access to website content puts robots.txt among the most litigated bits of code, factoring into more than a dozen cases involving copyright, hacking, trespass, tort law, and even <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/089050p.pdf">a 2009 judicial misconduct inquiry</a> involving former 9<sup>th</sup> Circuit Chief Judge Alex Kozinski. <em>—Amanda Levendowski, director of the Intellectual Property and Information Policy Clinic at Georgetown Law</em>

  Ward Cunningham first invented the Wiki with his site WikiWikiWeb, which he imagined as the simplest possible way to share information. He used a basic markup language, which involves brackets, stringing words together without spaces, and apostrophes around text, for editors to update and organize information linked across pages—a system still in wide use today on wikis, including Wikipedia, which launched in 2001. The accessible format has made the wiki a tool for some of the most important forms of active collaboration online, from tracking security bugs to taking notes. But as with anything editable online, wikis are vulnerable to vandalism and fierce arguments about what should and shouldn’t be posted, which is why Wikipedia includes talk pages and rules that govern how editors can add new information. —<em>April Glaser</em>

  More than 20 years ago, I wrote a scrap of JavaScript code that opened a second, small web browser window while opening the page you’d requested. This new window contained an ad—the dreaded pop-up ad. Over the next few years, I watched with horror as pop-up ads spread across the web, adopted by the worst, most intrusive advertisers on the web.

  The pop-up ad was designed to solve a real problem: My company, Tripod, let people put whatever content they wanted on a free home page. To subsidize the service, we sold ads. But advertisers didn’t always like the content of the page they featured on, so we decided to separate the ad from the user’s content. Hence, the pop-up ad.

  “WARNING: This shirt is classified as a munition and may not be exported from the United States, or shown to a foreign national,” the shirt <a href="http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/uk-shirt.html">warned</a>. For a time, the United States government treated strong encryption like surface-to-air missiles: too dangerous to fall into the hands of America’s foes. The idea made a kind of sense when encryption lived in heavy, expensive devices, but a lot less sense when the State Department tried to tell cryptography researchers in the 1990s they couldn’t post their code on the internet. But the RSA encryption algorithm—one of the basic building blocks of modern cryptography—is elegant enough that it can be written out in just four dense lines of Perl code … short enough to fit on a T-shirt. The original shirts are now collector’s items; the export controls, although not completely gone, have been substantially pared back. —<em>James Grimmelmann, professor of law at Cornell Tech and Cornell Law School</em>

  Before PageRank, search engines tried to find info based on whether our query words matched the words in the document. But with PageRank, Larry Page and Sergey Brin had a brilliant idea: Knowledge was social—search should be as well. They created an algorithm that ranked the prominence of a page based on how many other pages online linked to it.

  Douglas Englebart and Bill English’s invention of the mouse in the late 1960s transformed the way we could communicate with computers. While using a mouse was intuitive, display technology at the time couldn’t often keep up with the quick movements of the mouse. Operating system developers added the mouse trail—the momentary, shadowy images that showed a cursor’s previous position, making it easier to follow and find.

The Roomba proved that while our attention gravitates toward hardware—such as freaky backward-kneed, door-opening <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/the-robot-dog-that-can-open-a-door-is-even-more-impressive-than-it-looks.html">dogs</a>—software might be even more important for a product’s wide adoption. The <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/isaac-asimovs-laws-of-robotics-are-wrong/">Asimovian-named</a> iRobot did not create the first robotic vacuum, but the Roomba became a niche must-have not because of how well it sucks, but because of how well it navigated a room. As a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4XB2wZqF4">thousand cat videos</a> can attest, in the modern computing age, little has been as viscerally satisfying (and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/technology/roomba-irobot-data-privacy.html">disarming</a>) as watching a Roomba bump into a table leg, rotate itself, and continue on. —<em>Lowen Liu, Slate</em>

  At any given moment in a given area, there are often many more cellphones than there are base station towers. Unmediated, all of these transmissions would interfere with one another and prevent information from being received reliably. So the towers have a prioritization problem to solve: making sure all users can complete their calls, while taking into account the fact that users in noisier places need to be given more resources to receive the same quality of service. The solution? A compromise between the needs of individual users and the overall performance of the entire network. Proportional fair scheduling ensures all users have at least a minimal level of service while maximizing total network throughput. This is done by giving lower priority to users that are anticipated to require more resources. Just three lines of code that make all 3G and 4G cellular networks around the world work. <em>—Lav Varshney</em>

  A decade ago, as many as 15 million computers were infected with Conficker, a virus exploiting weaknesses in Windows operating systems. The virus was feared but also revered for its sophistication: It enlisted each computer as part of a giant bot army, awaiting orders, and it prevented infected computers from opening security programs or downloading patches that could clear the virus. Its earliest version also had an interesting and potentially telling quirk: It self-destructed within any systems using a Ukrainian keyboard or Ukrainian IP address. Years later, authorities and researchers who reverse-engineered the virus concluded that several Conficker creators were indeed Ukrainian and had designed the virus to avoid breaking their own country’s laws. Luckily, the hackers never deployed their botnet army for ill, and as of 2018, an estimated <a href="https://medium.com/threat-intel/conficker-anniversary-db03f2487241">350,000 computers</a> were still infected with the virus, a reminder of how easily skilled programmers could unleash international attacks, selectively wreaking havoc upon users. <em>—Jane C.

  Facebook sold the “like” button as a way to show the world we liked <em>The Simpsons </em>or <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/10/youarewhatyoulike-find-out-what-algorithms-can-tell-about-you-based-on-your-facebook-account.html">curly fries</a>. But in reality, it took advantage of our cognitive biases and the power of design to goad us into sharing even more information. It followed us around the internet—thanks to the tracking pixel Sara Wachter-Boettcher described above—collecting data on our browsing habits. Facebook then took that information and sold its behavioral targeting algorithm to advertisers. If an outdoor products company wanted to advertise, Facebook knew to target those who had previously “liked” posts about hiking, visited camping websites, and had outdoorsy friends. And when those users “liked” a company’s advertisement, that information was fed back into the targeting algorithm. And so the cycle of surveillance and commercial manipulation continued. All because of a tiny blue thumbs up. —<em>Ari Ezra Waldman, professor, New York Law School</em>

  When you send information over a plain-old HTTP to a website, it’s leaky—someone could intercept it and eavesdrop on your credit card, your health information, your pet name for your partner.

Enter HTTP Strict Transport Security, a development that ensured all web traffic sent to and from sites is encrypted from the start.

  In 2014, security researchers discovered a vulnerability in OpenSSL, a hugely popular open-source library used by roughly two-thirds of websites—including DropBox, Twitter, Yahoo, and GitHub—for online communication between two computers. Heartbleed could have allowed perpetrators to steal unencrypted secret information, including credentials and encryption keys, through a buffer over-read vulnerability<strong> </strong>that affected millions of devices. It drew attention to the risks associated with relying on open-source software for crucial security functions, as well as the challenges of identifying vulnerabilities in code that seems to be working perfectly for years and years. On a more positive note, the discovery of Heartbleed also triggered a prompt and largely effective global response, including coordinated worldwide publicity and remediation efforts that went well beyond many previous such campaigns for earlier vulnerabilities. —<em>Josephine Wolff, assistant professor, Tufts University</em>

  In October 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 dove into the sea shortly after takeoff in a seemingly freak accident. Boeing assured the public that the planes were safe, saying more pilot training and a “software upgrade” were all that was needed. But just four months later, the pilots of an Ethiopian Airlines flight struggled to pull the nose up 20 times while the plane’s automated system tried to push it down. Within minutes after takeoff, everyone aboard was dead. In response, aviation authorities worldwide grounded the planes. Investigations revealed the crashes were caused by the 737 Max’s design, particularly little-known and poorly understood software that could force the plane into repeated nosedives. —<em>Mar Hicks, historian of technology and author of </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262535181/?tag=slatmaga-20" data-amzn-asin="0262535181">Programmed Inequality</a>
