Sounds like a pretty ridiculous question, but apparently, it's not in 2016. That's right: A very real CNN chyron (TV news lingo for headline on the lower part of the screen) on Monday afternoon read "Alt-Right Founder Questions If Jews are People." </p><p class="body-text">Nope, it's not a Clickhole headline. And what's even worse? <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">The conversation went on for several minutes</em>, as if Trump denouncing neo-Nazis is a political risk of some kind. Additionally, CNN made the entire issue even more egregious by inflaming the issue with an extreme headline that used "alt-right founder" instead of "supremacist."</p><p class="body-text">In the segment, CNN Host Jim Sciutto discussed with political commentators whether Trump should formally denounce supporters from the alt-right. Specifically, they were talking about the National Policy Institute's Richard Spencer, who came up with the term "alt-right" to describe what pretty much amounts to white supremacists and neo-Nazis. Sciutto read the following Spencer quote: "One wonders if these people are people at all, or instead soulless golem."</p><p class="body-text">It's important to note that while Spencer is, indeed, an anti-Semite, this quote in particular was not technically about whether Jews are people. Instead, he was asking whether media figures denouncing Trump are people, or if they were soulless golems created by the Jews. A golem, by the way, is a creature created by a <a class="body-link" href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Golem.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Golem.html">rabbi in a Jewish folktale</a> meant to protect Jews from anti-Semites, so yeah, his quote is still pretty terribleâ€”as was CNN's dancing around the topic.</p><p class="body-text">Is this what the next four years will look like?</p></div></div></div></div>
