<p>If the ultimate goal is to integrate Deep Speech, I believe a better use for Alex' time would be to work in the backend instead the frontend being discussed here, since they should be totally decoupled, i.e, finish the docker containing deepspeech and deploy it to Mozilla's services cloud infrastructure, for online decoding, and/or, create another bug and patch just to integrate deepspeech's inference stack and models into gecko, plus the HTTP service which will receive the requests from the frontend here, in the case of offline.</p>
<p>Both are still missing and currently needs more attention than the patch being worked here, which is already functional if manually applied to Gecko.</p>

<p>There's not that much to finish, it's working, and is iso-feature to the other implem served by speech proxy. I guess it would be more a question of production deployment etc. :)</p>

<p>The Deep Speech backend exists already here [<a href="https://gitlab.com/deepspeech/ds-srv" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.com/deepspeech/ds-srv</a>].</p>

<p>So there is no blocker in that regard.</p>

<p>Cool, so is better to work on the tidbits to integrate deepspeech into gecko on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1474084" title="ASSIGNED - WebSpeech API with offline STT via DeepSpeech">bug 1474084</a> instead this one.</p>
<p>The goal of the patch here is to create an agnostic frontend which can communicate to whichever decoder through an HTTP Rest API, regardless of online or offline.</p>
<p>If the goal is to create a local deepspeech speech server exposed via http, you can use this as a frontend, but if the goal is to do something different, like for example injecting the frames directly into the inference stack, then is better to create a completely new SpeechRecognitionService instead injecting decoder specific code in this patch.</p>

<p>We want to use REST for offline?</p>
</div></div><div id="c65"><div id="ct-65" data-comment-id="13972009" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>I meant if you add a local http service to DEFAULT_RECOGNITION_ENDPOINT, it should work.</p>

<p>It's not going to ride the trains. The plan is to hold the feature in Nightly. I guess that means it doesn't go into the release notes. But asking for folks to flip the pref and test it in Nightly would be good.</p>

<p>Are there any instructions for testing this in nightly? I'm a web developer who runs Firefox Nightly and has given several talks on the Web Speech API. Very keen to help with testing.</p>

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>the API hasn't landed and isn't available in Nightly yet , but as soon there is, to enable it will be just matter of switching a couple of flags on (if at all)</p>
