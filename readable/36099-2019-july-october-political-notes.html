Makes sense to me.  Sooner or later Iran will capture one.
Maybe then they can swap captures.

Most of the recommendations are good ones, and I agree
with the main point that society as a whole
needs to protect everyone's privacy, and not merely "protect" data
bases.
</p><p>
However, the article does not recognize the issues of free software,
and peer-to-peer vs centralization.

The Names Of The Entities That Own Them Are Trade Secrets</a>.
</p><p>
Calling something a "trade secret" is just a way of saying "I don't
want to tell you."  Why do governments so often allow companies to
conceal important information simply because they want to?  Many
countries have adopted laws and policies which give undue respect to
the wishes of companies.
</p><p>
We should change that.  Let's not allow companies that make or sell
election systems to keep anything about them secret, except the
password that they give to the purchaser.  The software in them
should be free.
</p><p>
However, making the software free/libre 
<a href="/evoting.html">does not make a computer trustworthy for
recording votes</a>.  We have to do that on paper!

<p>
Hong Kong <a href="/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> attacked protesters; the protesters then attacked the

Radar could make it possible

a driver's health</a> without identifying per.
</p><p>
Using radar probably doesn't automatically assure the driver is not
identified.  It's possible that the radar system could measure the
driver's height, for instance.  We need free software to guarantee
that the radar is not misused.  After all, you can't trust a car
company to be honest about what its software
does, <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2017-sep-dec.html#9_December_2017_(Volkswagen_executive)">or
even to obey laws</a>.

</p></li><li>12 July 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#12_July_2019_(UK_emissions_proposal)">UK emissions proposal</a>)
<p>
The UK has a proposal for net-zero-emissions by 2050.  Due to
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/12/theresa-may-net-zero-emissions-target-climate-change">weaknesses

Someone <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/13/oil-tankers-blasts-reports-gulf-of-oman-us-navy">attacked
Japan-bound tankers</a> in the Persian Gulf just as Japan was holding
negotiations with Iran.
</p><p>
The UAE says Iran did it, but it would make no sense for Iran to do
that — it would be self-defeating.  So I suspect Iran's enemies
(US allies) of doing the attack.

<p>
Putin made journalist Ivan
Golunov <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/11/russian-officials-ivan-golunov-investigative-journalist">a
national hero</a> by framing him and torturing him.
</p><p>
The article also explains how complete the repression of protest is in
Russia.  <a href="/glossary.html#planet">Planet roasters</a> in the US are trying
to <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2018-sep-dec.html#29_September_2018_(Jailing_fracking_protesters)">head
in that direction</a> now.
</p><p>
Amazingly, the state has backed down
and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/ivan-golunov-russian-police-drop-charges-against-journalist">dropped
the bogus charges</a>.  They must have caused too much international
embarrassment.
</p><p>
The high-level political support Golunov has received leads me to
suspect that the frame-up was organized by local officials without
Putin's approval.

</p></li><li>11 July 2019 (<a class="titlelink" href="#11_July_2019_(UK_parliament)">UK parliament</a>)
<p>
The UK parliament is afraid that Boris Johnson, if he becomes prime
minister, would prorogue (dismiss) parliament and not call it back
into session until after the UK drifts out of the EU.  Therefore, some
members of parliament 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/09/grieve-proroguing-parliament-would-be-end-of-democracy-in-uk">plan
to pass a law they hope will block that</a>.

Should we call the supporters of Johnson "pro-rogue"?

<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/matteo-salvinis-party-under-investigation-for-alleged-russian-oil-deal">being
investigated</a>, accused of making a deal to get Russian fund.
</p><p>
I have a sad hunch he won't lose any support for this.
</p><p>
Communism was once an international movement.  Then, Communists
professed good, idealistic goals, while some carried out repression
that they hid from the rest.  Communists considered it entirely proper
for the Soviet Union to aid Communist parties all around the world.
</p><p>
Now fascists have made an international movement, with repression as
the overt goal.  I have a hunch Salvini's followers will say, "It's
great that you got funds from Putin so we subject Italy to
repression."

A hundred criminal cases were dropped because he was involved in them.
Eight convictions have been overturned, but I think it is unlikely
that he succeeded in framing people only eight times.

I watched Apollo 17 take off — its launch into space was no

will go all the way.

If you haven't got your bearings to identify the absurd conspiracies,
a heuristic you can use is to ignore anyone who endorses the moon
landings hoax claim.

As for bigger jobs, such as curing cancer, we are doing that.  A

The article does not say, but it sounds like he bought arms illegally
that were offered to him under the auspices of the FBI.  I can't be
certain, but I suspect he would never have been a real threat without
FBI help.

In some such cases, state informants have spent months persuading the
accused person to undertake the fantasy act of terrorism.  Those
people would not even have wanted to commit terrorism if not for the
activities of state agents.
</p><p>
These activities give the impression of protecting the public, but
they don't really do that.

reCAPTCHA version 3 supposedly figures out "are you human?", and

Anti-trust rules could help deal with this, if they prohibit Google
from inviting lots of web sites from making use of a Google account
their criterion for letting people log in.  Competitors to Google
can't possibly test that.
</p><p>
It also penalizes users that browse via Tor.
Since I won't trust these companies to know where I am,
I won't turn off Tor to use a web site.  I simply won't use it.
