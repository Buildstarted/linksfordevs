Slightly tilting my head would result in a buzzing noise with changing intensity depending on how my head moved.</p><p>Support agreed that this is a problem and sent a new AirPod.</p><p>A few weeks later the right AirPod started to produce weird rattling noises. It sounded like some tiny part fell off and was now bouncing around in the AirPod. It also started to behave weird as soon as there was a bit of wind.</p><p>Support agreed that this is a problem and sent a new AirPod.</p><p>Days later it was the left AirPod’s turn and it’s now rattling again.</p><p>There’s something very wrong with this product line and just getting a new one every few months is — financially and ecologically — not sustainable as they end up in a landfill.
