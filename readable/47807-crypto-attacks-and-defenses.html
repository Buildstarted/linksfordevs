    <h1>Crypto Attacks and Defenses</h1>
    <article class="row post"> <div class="post-body"> <p>This training familiarizes developers and security professionals of any level with modern cryptography concepts and best practices. It covers basic notions, including randomness generation, authenticated encryption, and elliptic curves, as well as applications like TLS 1.3, password security protocols, libraries and APIs, and software side-channel attacks. Finally, our training offers an overview of advanced topics including post-quantum cryptography.</p> <p>We have given cryptography trainings since 2013, and over the years have kept improving our content and format for an optimal learning experience. We strive to make cryptography more approachable and less abstract than in typical teaching material.</p> <p>The class is:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Practice-oriented</strong>: Lectures present real-world failures and by analyze how they could have been avoided, and exercise sessions consist of a mix of made-up problems and examples of real vulnerabilities found in widely deployed systems.</li> <li><strong>New and unique</strong>: We are closely involved in the latest developments in cryptography, and regularly integrate new content into our trainings to follow the latest innovations and applications. Each training session therefore includes fresh and updated content.</li> <li><strong>Interactive</strong>: We encourage participants to ask questions about the topics presented or even other topics, which usually leads to interesting discussions.</li>
</ul> <p>Previous versions of this training were given at events including Black Hat Europe, Troopers, and in private sessions for organizations including Google and Facebook.</p> <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2> <p><strong>DAY 1 morning</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Randomness</strong> (40min) <ul> <li>Randomness notion and applications in cryptography</li> <li>How to safely generate randomness on Linux, Windows, and macOS</li> <li>Examples of real bugs caused by randomness failures</li> </ul> </li> <li>Break (15min)</li> <li><strong>Symmetric cryptography</strong> (50min) <ul> <li>Hash functions: how (not) to use them, which one to choose?</li> <li>Ciphers: AES or not AES?

</ul> <p>The exercise sessions will include the following challenges, and potentially others created specifically for the event based on recent vulnerabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Find bugs in weak pseudo-random generators, and fix them</li> <li>Decrypt messages encrypted using RSA without the private key</li> <li>Break a bad implementation of AES-based encryption</li> <li>Implementing the logic of elliptic curve-crypto schemes (DH, DSA, ElGamal)</li> <li>Exploit CBC padding oracles to decrypt messages without the AES key</li> <li>Break the authenticated encryption in the open smart grid protocol</li> <li>Cryptanalyze hash functions to find colliding messages</li> <li>Recover ECDSA private keys by exploiting a flawed randomness generator</li>
</ul> <h2 id="audience">Audience</h2> <p>This training is suitable to any security professional or security-minded developer who has at least some basic understanding of cryptography. You should know the difference between public-key cryptography and secret-key cryptography, but you don&#x2019;t need to know the maths behind. We expect participants to be familiar with basic programming concepts, and it&#x2019;s recommended to be familiar with C and Python syntax, since many exercises are in one of these languages.</p> <h2 id="trainers">Trainers</h2> <p>Both trainers hold PhDs in cryptography and have in combination more than 20 years of experience in designing cryptosystems and in finding vulnerabilities in real-world applications. The trainers are also experienced speakers, regularly presenting at leading industry and research conferences all around the world.Both trainers hold PhDs in cryptography and have in combination more than 20 years of experience in designing cryptosystems and in finding vulnerabilities in real-world applications.
