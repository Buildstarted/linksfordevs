														<p>For a project thatâ€™s still in the phase of contemplation and feasibility study right now, Iâ€™d be interested in talking to any readers who happen to be experienced web developers. If I go forward with it â€” and whether I do or not may come to hinge on any feedback I get as a result of this little message â€” it will encompass both an aesthetic design and a significant technical â€” read, custom programming â€” component. I understand that those two roles will quite likely need to be played by two or more people, and thatâ€™s fine, although they would ideally be people who already have experience working together as a team.</p>
<p>On the technical end, Iâ€™d like to use WordPress if at all possible, as I already have a lot of experience with it and it works well for me. Thus a developer experienced with building on the WordPress platform would be the best candidate. That said, if after hearing my nascent plans you feel some other content-management system would work better Iâ€™m willing to listen and possibly even be convinced.</p>
<p>Note that Iâ€™m not asking for any freebies here. Iâ€™m happy to pay fair value for good, professional-level work â€” although if you do enjoy the my writing and want to give me a little discount on that basis, I certainly wouldnâ€™t be too proud to accept it.</p>
<p>So, if youâ€™d be interested in talking further, please drop me a line at maher@filfre.net and introduce yourself (if we donâ€™t know each other already, that is). Links to samples of your work would be appreciated. If you happen to be a Patreon patron, please let me know that as well.</p>
<p>Sorry to have to be so cagey in public about what this is all about. I hope you know how it is with these things. I donâ€™t want to make any public pronouncements about things that quite possibly wonâ€™t happen. But donâ€™t worry: this blog isnâ€™t going anywhere.</p>
<p>Huge thanks as always for your readership and your support, and see you again on Friday!</p>
