<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>I've just released a new version of <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/idris-2-version-020-released.html">Idris 2</a>, which is a
significant release in that it's the first one which is able to compile itself.
Thus, it's the first one where we can really see how the performance of Idris 2
improves on the performance of Idris 1.</p>
<p>A question people sometimes ask when discussing Idris on various parts of
the Internet is "Why is Idris 2 so much faster than Idris 1?" Sometimes
it involves the phrase "the author claims that..." so here are some
numbers, as measured today on my Dell XPS 13:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idris 1 building Idris 2 (bootstrap version): 743s</li>
<li>Idris 2 building Idris 2 (with the Chez Scheme runtime): 76s</li>
</ul>
<p>This is for type checking and generating/optimising intermediate code only, and
doesn't include generating and compiling the C/Chez Scheme output.
The bootstrap version is a slightly earlier version, and a little bit
smaller, but they are similar enough to be able to make a useful comparison,
and certainly give you a feel of how much of an improvement Idris 2 is. That's
nearly an order of magnitude!</p>
<p>I wouldn't necessarily say the result is
<em>fast</em> in an absolute sense <a href="#id4" id="id1">[1]</a> and there are no doubt many improvements
still to be found, but it is still interesting to try to understand why
the difference. Idris 1 is implemented in Haskell, but that has
little (if anything) to do with the difference. Rather, it's a combination
of:</p>
<ul>
<li>my improved understanding of what it takes to implement a dependently
typed language (or, indeed, any language)</li>
<li>insights gained from other people's experiments, most notably
Andras Kovacs' work on <a href="https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/smalltt">smalltt</a></li>
<li>Lots of profiling, via <a href="http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/index.html">gprof</a> while bootstrapping,
and the <a href="https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/csug9.5/system.html#./system:h7">Chez Scheme profiling tools</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of the improvements are down to avoiding make bad decisions in the
first place! This is easy to say in hindsight, but Idris 1 was originally a
vehicle for experimenting with some ideas in dependently typed language
design that were hard to do just by modifying other systems and so I was
more interested in having a system sooner, rather than having a better
system. Unfortunately, some of those early decisions proved hard to undo
as the system grew and as it gained users.</p>
<p>The rest of this post summarises some of the most significant internal
differences.</p>
<div id="the-global-context">
<h2>The global context</h2>
<p>The global context stores all of the information that might be needed
for typechecking: function and data types and definitions, among other
things. We need function definitions as well as types, even for imported
modules, since we may need to do evaluation at the type level during
type checking.</p>
<p>The big difference between Idris 1 and Idris 2 is that Idris 2 represents
the context as an array, with constant time access and update. Yes, it's
mutable! We recognise that there's going to be a lot of updates: mainly
solving unification problems as type checking proceeds, but also during
interface resolution. And, we only ever have one context (ignoring
ambiguity resolution, but I won't go into that here). So, having a single
mutable context with constant time access has been valuable. Yes, it's
a bit ugly to a pure functional programmer, but I'm not going to let that
get in the way of performance! At least the types are precise about where
updates might happen.</p>
<p>This turns out to have another benefit, which is that on loading an
imported module, we don't need to add definitions to the context until
they are actually referenced. Most names from imports are never referenced
- at least not all in the same file - so Idris 2 lazily decodes definitions
and mutates the context when they are needed. In fact profiling Idris 1
suggests that it spends a huge amount of time unnecessarily loading
definitions.</p>
</div>
<div id="unification">
<h2>Unification</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)">Unification</a>
is an important part of type checking a dependently typed language, to
resolve implicit arguments. For example, if you have a function</p>
<pre>append : Vect n a -&gt; Vect m a -&gt; Vect (n + m) a
</pre>
<p>and an application</p>
<pre>append [1,2,3] [4,5,6,7]
</pre>
<p>...then the typechecker needs to infer that <tt>n = 3</tt>, <tt>m = 4</tt> and
<tt>a = Integer</tt>.  Idris 2 implements
<a href="http://adam.gundry.co.uk/pub/pattern-unify/">dynamic pattern unification</a>.
In Idris 1, metavariables (that is, the implicits that need to be solved)
are stored locally to a term, so solving them requires searching through
the term and substituting the definition, which can be expensive. Idris 2,
on the other hand, stores metavariables globally, in the mutable global
context, following roughly the scheme
described in <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ulfn/papers/thesis.html">Ulf Norell's thesis</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we don't substitute the solution of a metavariable in a term
unless we <em>really really need to</em> (in practice, that's only while checking
linear binders are used appropriately, so fairly rare). This preserves
sharing as far as possible, which can be important in terms with
dependent types. For example (with apologies for using a vector again):</p>
<pre>[1,2,3]
</pre>
<p>elaborates into</p>
<pre>((::) {a=Integer} {n=S (S Z))} 1
  ((::) {a = Integer} {n=S Z} 2
    ((::3) {a = Integer} {n=Z} (Nil {a = Integer})))
</pre>
<p>That <tt>Z</tt> appears three times, the subexpression <tt>S Z</tt> appears twice, and
this gets worse as the vector grows. So sharing is important! This is the main
insight gained from Andras Kovacs' work on <a href="https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/smalltt">smalltt</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="compile-time-evaluation">
<h2>Compile-time evaluation</h2>
<p>Type checking a dependently typed language involves evaluating expressions,
possibly in the presence of unknown variables, to check whether two terms
are equal or to infer values for metavariables.
For example, we might need to solve for <tt><span>?meta</span></tt> in the following:</p>
<pre>plus (S (S x)) (S (S y)) = S ?meta
</pre>
<p>Idris 1 does this by evaluating the terms, leading to the equation</p>
<pre>S (S (plus x (S (S y)))
</pre>
<p>...then deciding <tt><span>?meta</span> = S (plus (x (S (S <span>y))))</span></tt>. This is fine for small
terms, but what if the expression is</p>
<pre>plus 100 100 = S ?meta
</pre>
<p>...or something even larger? We don't need to evaluate fully to normal form to
establish that <tt><span>?meta</span> = plus 99 100</tt>. Idris 2 therefore reduces to
<a href="http://foldoc.org/Head+Normal+Form">head normal form</a> during type checking,
which it probably should have done all along!
<a href="https://help.luddy.indiana.edu/techreports/TRNNN.cgi?trnum=TR44">Cons should not evaluate its arguments</a>.</p>
<p>Normally, you won't notice this. But, sometimes, in Idris 1, compile time
evaluation really hurts performance, and a dependently typed language needs
to recognise that compile time evaluation is going to happen a lot!</p>
</div>
<div id="chez-scheme-runtime">
<h2>Chez Scheme runtime</h2>
<p>Idris 2 benefits from a robust, well-engineered and optimised run time
system, by compiling to Chez Scheme. One might expect that Chez Scheme would
be slower than the C code generated by Idris 1, since it is dynamically
typed, but this ignores two important points:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to turn off the dynamic type checks in Chez Scheme.
So, the run time never checks if a constructor argument is within bounds of
the vector where we store it, and never checks whether a primitive is the
right type.</li>
<li>Even more importantly, there has never been significant effort put into the
Idris 1 run time. Generating good C code corresponding to a functional
program which might have lots of small (and higher order) definitions is
extremely challenging, so it is better to take advantage of someone
else's work here.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="abandoning-tactic-based-elaboration">
<h2>Abandoning tactic-based elaboration</h2>
<p>Idris 1 used a tactic-based elaborator, much as you'd see in
<a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proof-engine/tactics.html">Coq proofs</a>. This
made implementing new high level features relatively easy, using an
elaboration monad which was, in a sense, an embedded domain specific
language for writing new tactics. This is usable directly by
<a href="http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/elaboratorReflection/elaborator-reflection.html">elaborator reflection</a>
meaning that users could try extending Idris in Idris itself. While this
is a fun way to work on the language, it took a lot of effort to get it
to perform even as well as it did (which, as you see above, is not that
well). Idris 2 takes a much simpler approach, elaborating syntax directly
into the core representation.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-reasons">
<h2>Non-reasons</h2>
<p>One performance problem in Idris 1 was due to space leaks in the Haskell
caused by using lazy data structures where they weren't needed.
Despite our best efforts, we were never able to resolve these fully.
No doubt it would have been better to consider where strict data structures
would have been better. But, we didn't. This isn't to say that Idris has
proved a better implementation choice because it's strict, just to say that
we needed to put more thought, earlier, into where we needed strict data
in Haskell.</p>
<table id="id4">
<colgroup><col><col></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td><a href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>It's about 45,000 lines of Idris 2 code. No doubt a Go programmer, or
even a Pascal programmer in the 1970s, would scoff at the idea that a mere
45,000 lines would take 76 seconds to type check. But, those 45,000 lines are
pulling a lot of weight, and the type checker is doing a lot of work!  For
example, the fact that it typechecks means that all of the functions cover all
possible inputs, and all expressions throughout all phases are guaranteed
to be scope correct, as is unification. This is a major source of bugs in a
type checker and compiler.</td></tr>
