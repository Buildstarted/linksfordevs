			<h4>If you fancy taking a sideways glance at this year’s London Motor and Tech Show, then hitch a ride with Caterham.</h4>
<p>To celebrate the launch of the new Caterham Driving Experience operated by MSV at Brands Hatch, Caterham will be bringing its pro-driving team to the event along with a new and improved ‘Drift Taxi’.</p>
<p><img src="https://thelondonmotorshow.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Caterham_10-500x333.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333"></p>
<p>Drift Taxi will offer thrill-seeking visitors the chance to jump into the passenger seat for an unforgettable, tyre-smoking, drifting experience that isn’t for the faint hearted.</p>
<p>As the first show to host the exhilarating experience, the Imperial Cars Live Arena will see three specially-engineered vehicles offer rapid-fire drifting sessions over the course of the event.&nbsp; Weighing just over 500kg, and equipped with a 1.6 Ford Sigma engine which delivers 135bhp, guests can experience first-hand the undisputed power, handling and precision of the Caterham Seven 270.</p>
<h4>The drift taxi experience will be available for visitors to book throughout the show and&nbsp;can be found in the Imperial Cars Live Arena, based in halls N9 – N12. Its &nbsp;yet another of the amazing automotive experiences lived up to wow the audience. The drift taxi will be taking place throughout the weekend and customers can book on the day.</h4>

<p>Joining Caterham’s drifting line-up will be the legendary Seven 620R, aka LEGO CAT, which famously dominated the Goodwood Hill Climb in 2017.&nbsp;Decorated in LEGO’s resplendent yellow and offering 310bhp, it will be the centre of the Caterham display, as well as running during the Supercar Parade with a few donuts for good measure.</p>
<p>Graham Macdonald, Chief Executive Officer at Caterham said: “Over the last few years we have supported the London Motor Show on a number of occasions, but this year will certainly be our biggest to date.&nbsp; The Caterham Drift Taxi is truly a unique and fun experience, and to demonstrate it on such a large scale will certainly leave a smile everyone’s face; which perfectly demonstrates what we stand for as a brand.”</p>
<p>Andy Entwistle, London Motor and Tech Show CEO, said: “The Caterham Drift Taxi is an experience like no other so is the perfect complement to the show. If you fancy thumbing the lift of your life, then these guys will give you an experience you’ll never forget in the show’s Live Arena.”</p>
<p>However, for the younger audience – or those who fancy a more relaxed experience, Caterham will be displaying their full range of cars, along with a giant, interactive version of their highly-praised Caterham Configurator on their stand in the ‘Built In Britain’ section of the show.</p>

<p>The drift taxi event is sponsored by Caterham’s longstanding partner, Avon Tyres.</p>
<p>The 2019 London Motor Show will take place between 16 – 19 May 2019. Visitors can find the Caterham Drift Taxi in the Imperial Cars Live Arena based in halls N9 – N12.</p>
<p>The show&nbsp;takes place from 16-19 May at London’s ExCel Arena, with tickets on sale now. Adult entry costs from just £10, with free entry for children under 16.
