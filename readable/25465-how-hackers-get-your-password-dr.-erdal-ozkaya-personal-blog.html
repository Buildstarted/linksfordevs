            <h1>How Hackers Get your Password? | Dr. Erdal Ozkaya Personal Blog</h1>
        
<div class="readable"><div class="entry-content"> <p>It&#x2019;s not a secret anymore, Hackers know our passwords. &#xA0;<strong>551,509,767</strong> real-world passwords previously exposed in data breaches. <strong>Are you one of those victims</strong>? Has your email been compromised or found in a data breach so far? <strong>How do hackers get your passwords</strong>? In this article, I am going to write the common methods which hackers use to steal your passwords and then I will recommend you the industry<strong> best practices to keep you or at least your passwords safe &#x1F60A; </strong></p> <h4><strong>Mass Theft
</strong></h4> <p>This is the most convenient way for hackers, instead of hacking 10.000 people, <strong>they hack a vulnerable web site</strong>, which has all the information they need. Yes, I know this sounds hard but in reality, it&#x2019;s not.<em> Just recently (3 April 2019)</em> more than<strong> 540 million records </strong>which included extensive details, including people&#x2019;s comments, likes, names, and Facebook IDs were found in Amazon unprotected. (plain text) (You can Read <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275837/facebook-plain-text-password-storage-hundreds-millions-users">here</a> the details )</p> <p>Hackers can also steal &#x201C;<strong>hashes</strong>&#x201D;, like in 2012, <strong>LinkedIn</strong> was saving their user database <strong>unsalted, </strong>which means &#x201C;a random data was not used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. <strong>Salting in cryptography is used to safeguard passwords; </strong>keeping it short they had no extra safeguard implemented to protect the passwords) </p> <h4><strong>Brute Force</strong></h4> <p>Hackers can use tools that can crack your password b<strong>y simply entering different passwords over and ove</strong>r until it&#x2019;s cracked (<strong>unless you have account lockout or MFA</strong>) ; Depending on the password complexity &#xA0;most passwords can be cracked very fast, as<strong> 123456 </strong>is still a very common password the time which is required to crack <strong>(0.02 seconds</strong>) this password is very very low compared <strong><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>_?!.) &#xA0;&#xA3;4&lt;*aL^</strong> &#xA0;(<strong>198 years </strong>depending on the resources available for the attack )</p> <h4><strong>Phishing &#x2013;
Social Engineering</strong></h4> <p><strong>A hacker will send a login page for the account they aim to steal from you</strong>, which can be Facebook, Online Banking web site, Outlook, etc. They will try to make you believe that your account is under danger, to be safe click on the &#x201C;<strong>provided</strong>&#x201D; URL&#x2019;s, which is fake of course, but the victim will not notice that and enter their details&#x2026;</p> <h4><strong>Malware Attacks</strong></h4> <p>Below are some examples for Malware
attacks, out of many different Malware attack types </p> <h4><strong>Keylogger</strong></h4> <p>A basic tool&#xA0;to get your passwords. Keylogger resides in your system memory and runs secretly in the background, it <strong>logs every keystroke from your computer, and then sends the information back to the hacker.</strong></p> <h4><strong>RAT</strong></h4> <p>Remote Administration Tool , where<strong> a hacker can connect remotel</strong>y to any PC without any permission &#x1F60A; </p> <h2><strong>Trojan
Horse</strong></h2> <p>Malware which lands to your PC&#x2019;s through &#x201C;<strong>cracked software</strong>&#x201D; through &#x201C;<strong>warez</strong>&#x201D; web site.</p> <h4><strong>WI-FI Sniffers</strong></h4> <p>Once a hacker breaks into a Wi-Fi
network, unfortunately, it&#x2019;s nearly impossible to detect a Wi-Fi sniffer
attack, which means they will be intercepting all of the data you communicate.<strong></strong></p> <h4><strong>Recommendations</strong></h4> <ul><li><strong>Where
possible enable 2 Factor authentications</strong></li></ul> <p>Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and many other popular websites do provide this service. You can download an Authenticator <strong>app, which can be in an app in your phone, or you set up to receive SMS</strong> to the provided phone number or email to a preferred e-mail address.</p> <p>Based on a current study done by <strong>New York University and Google</strong>, simply adding a recovery phone number to your Account can block up to 100% of automated bots, 99% of bulk phishing attacks, and 66% of targeted attacks.</p> <p>If you&#x2019;ve signed into your phone or set up a recovery phone number an SMS code sent to a recovery phone number helped <strong>block 100% of automated bots, 96% of bulk phishing attacks, and 76% of targeted</strong>.&#xA0;On-device prompts, a more secure replacement for <strong>SMS, helped prevent 100% of automated bots, 99% of bulk phishing attacks and 90% of targeted attacks.</strong></p> <ul><li>Make sure to have an <strong>up-to-date Anti-Virus</strong> </li><li>Make sure to install a <strong>Firewall</strong> (or make sure your Windows Firewall is enabled)</li><li><strong>Never open suspicious attachments</strong> in emails even if they are from someone you know (they might be a Vitim) <ul><li>When you need to open a link in an email, <strong>compare on what you see in the UR</strong>L and what actually the URL is (check the screenshot) or check that the web browser resolves the link properly. If, say, a &#x201C;whatever.bank.com&#x201D; link changes to &#x201C;somethingelse.org,&#x201D; exit the page immediately.</li></ul><ul><li>If you receive a message saying it&#x2019;s from a person you know and asks for critical data, call the person on the number stored in your contacts (instead of calling the SMS number) and verify that he/she has requested the data.&#xA0;</li></ul></li></ul> <figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Phising.jpg" alt class="wp-image-3711" srcset="https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Phising.jpg 866w, https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Phising-300x111.jpg 300w, https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Phising-768x285.jpg 768w, https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Phising-640x237.jpg 640w, https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Phising-400x148.jpg 400w, https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Phising-367x136.jpg 367w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px"></figure> <ul><li><strong>Log off</strong> from the web sites once you are done using them. log back next time, can be a pain, but at least you&#x2019;ll know that no one else can steal your token and log in without your permission</li><li><strong>Try not to reuse the same password</strong>, the below image illustrates how a leaked password which is used multiple times can affect you. </li></ul> <figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hacking-Footprint.png" alt class="wp-image-3712" srcset="https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hacking-Footprint.png 836w, https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hacking-Footprint-300x259.png 300w, https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hacking-Footprint-768x663.png 768w, https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hacking-Footprint-640x553.png 640w, https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hacking-Footprint-400x345.png 400w, https://www.erdalozkaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hacking-Footprint-367x317.png 367w" sizes="(max-width: 836px) 100vw, 836px"></figure> <ul><li><strong>Use biometrics</strong> like
