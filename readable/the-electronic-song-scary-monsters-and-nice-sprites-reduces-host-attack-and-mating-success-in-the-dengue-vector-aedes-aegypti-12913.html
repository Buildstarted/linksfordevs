In insects, low-frequency vibrations facilitate sexual interactions, whereas noise disrupts the perception of signals from conspecifics and hosts. Despite evidence that mosquitoes respond to sound frequencies beyond fundamental ranges, including songs, and that males and females need to struggle to harmonize their flight tones, the behavioral impacts of music as control targets remain unexplored. In this study, we examined the effects of electronic music (Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites by Skrillex) on foraging, host attack, and sexual activities of the dengue vector <em>Aedes aegypti</em>. Adults were presented with two sound environments (music-off or music-on). Discrepancies in visitation, blood feeding, and copulation patterns were compared between environments with and without music. <em>Ae. aegypti</em> females maintained in the music-off environment initiated host visits earlier than those in the music-on environment. They visited the host significantly less often in the music-on than the music-off condition. Females exposed to music attacked hosts much later than their non-exposed peers. The occurrence of blood feeding activity was lower when music was being played. Adults exposed to music copulated far less often than their counterparts kept in an environment where there was no music. In addition to providing insight into the auditory sensitivity of <em>Ae. aegypti</em> to sound, our results indicated the vulnerability of its key vectorial capacity traits to electronic music. The observation that such music can delay host attack, reduce blood feeding, and disrupt mating provides new avenues for the development of music-based personal protective and control measures against <em>Aedes</em>-borne diseases.</p></div></div><ul id="issue-navigation"><li></li><li></li></ul><div><div id="kwd0005"><h2>Keywords</h2><p><span>Dengue vector</span></p><p><span>Music</span></p><p><span>Visitation</span></p><p><span>Host attack</span></p><p><span>Blood feeding</span></p><p><span>Copulation</span></p></div></div><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X19301202" aria-disabled="true" tabindex="-1"><span>View full text</span></a><p><span>© 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.</span></p></article></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>
