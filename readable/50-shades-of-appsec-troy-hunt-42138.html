            The AppSec industry is enormously diverse and it only continues to diverge as we put more software into more things with more connections. Itâ€™s an industry thatâ€™s fluctuating between the sophisticated to the absurd, the intelligent to the primitive and the scary to the outright hilarious. Thereâ€™s valuable lessons to be taken away from these events and applied in our future security efforts.
In this talk Iâ€™m going to cover a broad spectrum of whatâ€™s happening in our industry â€“ an entire 50 shades of it in only 45 minutes â€“ and youâ€™ll get a sense of just how challenging itâ€™s becoming for those of us working in AppSec to keep ahead of the attacks. Iâ€™ll cover everything from the social aspects of hacking through to some of the more obscure attacks and the increasing challenges we have as defenders.
