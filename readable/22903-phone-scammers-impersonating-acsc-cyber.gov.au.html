These types of scams are also called ‘remote access scams’ or ‘impersonation scams’.</p><p>The scammers ask you to enter a URL in your web browser and provide your bank account details, and sometimes they try to entice you to transfer money – in one case, scammers asked for $20,000 to be transferred.</p><p>The Australian Cyber Security Centre will never contact you by phone to request access to your computer, ask you to install software, transfer money or request financial information.</p><p>If you get an unexpected telephone call from someone claiming to represent the Australian Cyber Security Centre who says your computer has been infected or hacked, hang up immediately.</p><p>Never give anyone your personal information such as your bank account or credit card details, or passwords.</p><p>Visit ACSC’s <a href="https://www.staysmartonline.gov.au/">Stay Smart Online website</a> and sign up for the alert service about new threats.</p><p>If you have been a victim of a cybercrime, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/report">ReportCyber</a>&nbsp;and report it.</p><p>Contact <a href="https://www.idcare.org/">IDCare </a>at idcare.org if you’ve experienced identity theft.</p><p>To report a cyber security incident, email <a href="mailto:asd.assist@defence.gov.au">asd.assist@defence.gov.au</a></p></div></div></div></div>
