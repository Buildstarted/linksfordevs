		<p>I know it’s been a while, but kids! I didn’t think a Facebook post was appropriate for this as I really wanted to keep this around as a reminder for anyone who reads it and for myself. I’m not looking for a discussion on what you think is right or wrong, that’s for you to keep on your internet space.</p>
<p>I’m one of those kooky people who believes in timing and the universe and God’s timing etc. so when I had the experience I had last Friday at the nail salon, I wondered if I was to experience something during this special month and also as a reminder of what my kids mean to me and the kind of people I hope they’d be or have surrounding them.</p>
<p>What happened? A bit. But I’ll share the relevant story. As I was sitting getting my dip done, 3 teenagers walked in – 2 girls, 1 boy. I wasn’t trying to listen but I heard “full set” as they were listing what they wanted done. The boy says “my mom said to get something natural”. I was like ok. Probably just having a little fun. Then he and his friend sit next to me. He keeps fidgeting and he’s nervous and they’re all talking calmly and the nail tech starts to work on him and he’s getting a full set done. That’s when I’m like “OH! Ok!” in my head. As she applies the nails he stops her to ask his friends how long should he have them. And they just say “oh, no, let her put them on and then she’ll cut them to something you’re comfortable with.” He relaxes a little. They converse some more. But I’m just sitting there with a smile on my face.</p>
<p>I finish before they do, and my heart tugs me to tell them my thoughts… “I just want to tell you that you have a beautiful friendship here and I’m really happy to see you be so supportive of your friend. It makes me really happy.” And I leave.</p>
<p>It’s PRIDE month. After reading all of the stories about people who do not have family or friends who do not speak to them, love them or have abandoned them, that encounter was a much needed reminder of the beautiful *young* people out there.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but think that if that was my son, I’d hope he had friends like that surrounding him. I’ve said to my husband many times, I will ALWAYS support my children no matter what. There will always be some tough love moments in there but I want them to know that they can come to me for anything. They will know they have parents that love them and support them, because I would never forgive myself if my child stopped talking to me or even worse, committed suicide because their parents didn’t accept them for who they are.</p>
<p>I know this is a touchy subject for many and it’s why I kept wondering whether or not I should post it. I’m sharing because I still get emotional when I think of those kids. When I think of my kids possibly being in that situation.</p>
<p>No matter what, we need to raise good humans, that treat others the way they want to be treated. Many of us are in that season of having kids or kids getting older and soon out the door. We should be proud of who we’re sending out there.</p>
<p>I’d love to get back into writing but my season currently calls for tending to two very busy little people. I’ll try my best!</p>

		<p><strong>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>At the end of most years, we often say how we wish it was over or we can’t wait for the new year to start. I can’t say that about 2017. I think compared to 2016, 2017 was a breath of fresh air. Of course it had it’s highs and lows with deaths in both of our families but it also brought us life, with our daughter, and learning to adjust to being a family of 4 and not 3 (huge transition by the way!) and I turned 30!</p>
<p>This year had me constantly&nbsp;redefining family – traditions, goals, growth, time and love. My son was starting school, our family was growing, and being pregnant, my hormones made my thoughts kick into high gear about what our new normal would be. It took lots of 90° turns at first but we’re figuring it out. The same way no one can prepare you for life with your first kid, the same can be said when you have your second. And you and your partner have to figure out what works for you as you tackle life and two littles. But in all the chaos, I knew more and more what I wanted for us and was able to create more definition in discussion with my husband.&nbsp;We celebrated our 8th wedding anniversary in September and after 8 years we’re still working on communication! But we’ve come a long way from our first year, and we still have a long way to go, but we’re determined to keep this train on the track and keep chugging forward.</p>
<p>I don’t have many major goals in store for 2018, but I want to make it about finding balance and taking better care of myself to be a better wife and mom for my family.</p>
<p>…And to blog more!</p>

		<p>Friday nights used to be dinner date night at our favorite bar, with our favorite bartender, food and people watching. It’s been a little over two years since we did it but Friday&nbsp;night I realized why I don’t really miss it.</p>
<p>I’d snuck into my son’s room, he should’ve been sleeping, because I heard him babbling away just before I put his laundry in the washing machine. Daddy does the night time routine so I normally get a hug and kiss goodnight downstairs. He immediately shot up and stretched out his arms for a “pick me up mommy” moment. I obliged and stood over his crib holding him and swaying. His arms flopped and my heart melted thinking he just wanted that cuddle to fall asleep.</p>
<p>I tried to put him down but I was deceived. So I sat on the floor with him and of course he tried to dart for a book for me to read. I said “no, no, sleep time” and he happily laid there on top of me, as I rested on our poof with my knees up in the air to avoid his full body weight on my growing bump. We just sat there. I held his little hand and he rested his other hand on my other hand holding him in place. As his hands started to relax, I thought ok, he’s asleep, and I moved a little. As quickly as I moved my hand, his little hand grabbed it back and searched for the other. I almost cried. The longer he stayed there, the more I felt his little sister basically kick “get him off!”. But I just raised my knees a little higher because little does she know that soon she will take up a lot of my time and he will no longer be my baby. He will be 2 in less than 2 weeks and his independent nature is proving that he’s moving further away from baby status.</p>
<p>So keep your Friday night drinks and laughs (for now). I’ve been given the blessing to cuddle and love a little human (soon to be 2!), that sees me as his world and he is definitely mine.</p>
