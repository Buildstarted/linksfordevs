    <p>My name is Jamie Heinemeier Hansson. Since my husband, David, <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1192540900393705474">tweeted</a> about an unfortunate and ridiculous situation with AppleCard that involves me, I have been (or my credit-worthiness has been) the subject of lots of speculation. Unlike David, I am an extremely private person who does not post on social media. I am slightly mortified to have my name in the news. However, lest I be cast as a meek housewife who cannot speak for herself, I would like to make the following statement:</p>

<p><b>I care about digital privacy.</b> It‚Äôs why I wanted an AppleCard in the first place.</p>

<p><b>I care about transparency and fairness.</b> It‚Äôs why I was deeply annoyed to be told by AppleCard representatives, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the algorithm,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just your credit score.‚Äù I have had credit in the US far longer than David. I have never had a single late payment. I do not have any debts. David and I share all financial accounts, and my very good credit score is higher than David‚Äôs. I had a career and was successful prior to meeting David, and while I am now a mother of three children ‚Äî a ‚Äúhomemaker‚Äù is what I am forced to call myself on tax returns ‚Äî I am still a millionaire who contributes greatly to my household and pays off credit in full each month. But AppleCard representatives did not want to hear any of this. I was given no explanation. No way to make my case.</p>

<p><b>I care about equality.</b> It‚Äôs why I told David he could tweet about this situation, even though the credit limit extended, or not extended, does not matter for my livelihood. It matters for the woman struggling to start a business in a world that still seems to think women can‚Äôt be as successful or creditworthy as men. It matters to the wife trying to get out of an abusive relationship. It matters to minorities harmed by institutional biases. It matters to so many. And so it matters to me.</p>

<p><b>I care about justice for all.</b> It‚Äôs why, when the AppleCard manager told me she was aware of David‚Äôs tweets and that my credit limit would be raised to meet his, without any real explanation, I felt the weight and guilt of my ridiculous privilege. So many women (and men) have responded to David‚Äôs twitter thread with their own stories of credit injustices. This is not merely a story about sexism and credit algorithm blackboxes, but about how rich people nearly always get their way. Justice for another rich white woman is not justice at all.</p>

<p><b>I care about companies and people doing the right thing.</b> We cannot bow down to the algorithms. We cannot keep sliding into a Black Mirror world. Apple can and should be better than this. We should all be better than this.</p>

<p>Finally, I hear the frustration of women and minorities who have already been beating this drum loudly and publicly for years without this level of attention. I didn‚Äôt wish to be the subject matter that sparked these fires, but I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre blazing. I may be silent on social media, but I am not silent. The debates and conversations David and I have about the world, and my observations, are often the source of his tweets. We are raising three boys together, and you better believe they hear a mother who is just as opinionated and just as equal as their father. On this topic David and I are thoroughly united, and I‚Äôm glad his large platform and my AppleCard issue have sparked a national conversation around institutional biases, blackbox algorithms, and the broken system that is our credit industry. This is not a story about me. Brilliant women are all over social media, using their voices to strive for a better way forward. Listen to them.</p>
