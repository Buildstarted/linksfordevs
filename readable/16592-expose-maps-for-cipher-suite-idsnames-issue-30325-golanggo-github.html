I often have issues with Go because some valuable information is either held private within a package, or in a format that cannot be accessed dynamically.</p><p>In this case, the valuable information is the available cipher suites. They are accessible, but I cannot query them. So I have to hard-code them in my package. Of course, this means, that I have to monitor this package for the infinite future for potential changes (e.g. if another cipher is added, or one gets disabled by default).</p><p>A simple use case in my situation is, to always enable as many ciphers as available (implemented). The more the better. Becasue, I don't care about confidentiality/integrity, I just want to make sure to be able to connect to as many (legacy) devices as possible in order to check them for something. So in my code I would like to read the slice of existing cipher suites and put them into the TLS config. Other people might have other criteria to chose their ciphers, e.g. any with certain attribtues,...</p><p>All the issue because of a single letter ;-) If<br><code>var cipherSuites = []*cipherSuite{ ... }</code><br>was just public, everything would be fine.</p><p>This would also be the <strong>most easy change</strong>, and every body could filter and apply the slice as needed. All information would be accessible from the outside. But I assume, this won't be the change implemented because of compatibility reasons.</p><p><strong>Second best option</strong> would be to add kind of a getter function returning that slice (or a copy if you want to maintain the isolation)</p><p><strong>Thrid best option</strong> would be a function returning something else, like a simple slice of cipher IDs or a map,... just as you were discussing above. But then we would be deciding other peoples use cases.</p><p>best regards,<br>Ben</p></div></div></div></div>
