I even created a custom syntax coloring scheme for our proprietary language and David added some great keyword based auto expansions.<br></p><p>It's feature rich and has everything a coder could want. Except for one thing and it drives me crazy to the point that each time I need to do it, it puts a stain on what is by all other accounts, a perfect editing experience.<br></p><p>In Xcode, I can select a word (or words), right click on it and the pop-up menu shows this.<br></p><p><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.grumpygamer.com/xcode_find_in.png"></p><p>It's my bread-and-butter for searching.<br></p><p>I can't do this in BBEdit. The closest I can come is selecting the word, then hitting ⌘-E to <b>Use Selected Text In Find</b>, then ⌘-G to bring up the <b>Search In Project</b> window and click on Find.<br></p><p>This is cumbersome as it requires me to move my hands to the keyboard. (yes, I know super programmers only use the keyboard, but clearly, not all of us do).<br></p><p>If I could get BBEdit to add just one thing, it would be this. Then it would be perfect.<br></p><p>During Thimbleweed Park I wasted several afternoons trying to hack this in with macros, etc.<br></p><p>P.S. To head off the griping/astonishment I get whenever I post a screenshot of my text editor... yes, I enjoy programming with a light/white background.  But only for C++. For other languages (in BBEdit), I use a dark/black background. As I am switching between the two all day long, I find my brain needs to strong visual distinction to differentiate the two.<br></p></div></div></div></div>
