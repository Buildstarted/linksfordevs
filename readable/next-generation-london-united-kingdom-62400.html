And why is it so exciting?</span></a></p><div><div><div><div><div><p><time datetime="1591808400000"><span><span>Wed, Jun 10</span>, <span><span>6:00 PM GMT+1</span></span></span></time></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>Abstract:
What started as a prototype in 2017 has become one of the hottest technologies in the .NET ecosystem. Blazor is Microsoft’s new front-end framework for building single page applications using C#, not JavaScript. That’s right, C# running in your browser. No plugins, transpilation or voodoo magic involved - just web standards.
In this talk, you'll learn all about this game changing platform and how it brings choice back into front-end development.

Starting from the beginning, you'll explore Blazor's flexible architecture and it's different rendering modes. You'll learn how C# code is able to run in the browser via a technology called WebAssembly. You'll also cover Blazor's component model, syntax, project types and more.
By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of what Blazor is and how it could be the last framework you'll ever need!

Agenda:

Chris will lead the session on Zoom, allowing you the opportunity to ask questions throughout. It will last aprox 1 hour.

The widespread adoption of WebAssembly, by all major browsers, has opened the world of front-end development to languages other than JavaScript. The platform leading the charge is Blazor - a new client-side UI framework from the Microsoft ASP.NET team. Blazor allows developers to write client-side applications using C# which runs inside the browser without needing plugins or transpilation - how cool is that!

In this code-focused session, we'll explore the Blazor platform. Starting with the fundamentals, we'll look at how to organise our applications for better maintainability. Then we'll look at how to handle user input using forms and validation. We'll then explore some more advanced topics such as JavaScript interop and authentication and authorisation.

This session is great for developers both new to Blazor or who have prior experience and want to deepen their knowledge.

When people talk about using ORMs (Object Relational Mappers) like Entity Framework or nHibernate in their projects, they commonly are only looking for one fundamental feature: the ability to map SQL output to C# object. Large ORM-based solutions add additional complexity and black-box much of what is happening behind the scenes.

What if there is a smaller, more efficient way to do object mapping without the overhead of an EF? Dapper to the rescue! Dapper is a micro-ORM whose core function is to reduce some of the ceremony of talking to a SQL database while leaving you in complete control!

In this session, we'll walk through many of the typical use-cases for Dapper and why you might want to consider it for your current or next project!
