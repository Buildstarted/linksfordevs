<p>As of the 5th July 2020, there are 1357 Tor bridges available for users in countries who censor the Tor network to use. Having just over 1,000 IP addresses is not a lot for such a big privacy network as Tor is, especially considering that the number of Tor Bridges peaked at 4,227 on the 4th January 2015. That means since then the network has lost more than two-thirds of its bridges.</p>
<p>The lack of bridges only makes it harder for people in oppressive countries to take advantage of both the anti-censorship and anonymizing power of the Tor network. In light of this, many people including the Tor project themselves have been trying to convince more people to become bridge operators.</p>
<p>This article will go over some ultra-cheap VPS hosts that will allow anyone to become a bridge operators without having to spend a sizeable amount of money;</p>
