<h3><strong>Update: January 28, 2020:&nbsp;Wawa Provides Customer Update on Previous Data Security Incident</strong><br>
<strong>[<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/wawa-kentico-prod/wawa/media/misc/jan-28-2020-wawa-press-release-update-to-dec-19-data-security-announcement.pdf" target="_blank">Link to PDF</a>]</strong></h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Wawa, PA (January 28, 2020) – Today, we became aware of reports of criminal attempts to sell some customer payment card information potentially involved in the previous Data Security Incident announced by Wawa on December 19, 2019.&nbsp; We have alerted our payment card processor, payment card brands, and card issuers to heighten fraud monitoring activities to help further protect any customer information.&nbsp; We continue to work closely with federal law enforcement in connection with their ongoing investigation to determine the scope of the disclosure of Wawa-specific customer payment card data.</p>

<p>We continue to encourage our customers to remain vigilant in reviewing charges on their payment card statements and to promptly report any unauthorized use to the bank or financial institution that issued their payment card by calling the number on the back of the card. &nbsp;Under federal law and card company rules, customers who notify their payment card issuer in a timely manner of fraudulent charges will not be responsible for those charges. &nbsp;In the unlikely event any individual customer who has promptly notified their card issuer of fraudulent charges related to this incident is not reimbursed, Wawa will work with them to reimburse them for those charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wawa remains&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;providing&nbsp;resources and support to our customers who may be impacted by this incident.&nbsp; We remind customers to sign up for the credit monitoring and identity theft protection we are offering free of charge by visiting our website (www.wawa.com/alerts/data-security) or by contacting our dedicated toll-free call center (1-844-386-9559).</p>

<p>We remain confident that the malware we discovered on December 10 was contained by December 12 and since that time has not posed a risk to our customers. &nbsp;We also remain confident that only payment card information was involved, and that no debit card PIN numbers, credit card CVV2 numbers or other personal information were involved.&nbsp; This incident did not impact ATM transactions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Wawa, nothing is more important than honoring and protecting our customers’ trust. Wawa continues to take steps to enhance the security of our systems.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>An Open Letter from Wawa CEO Chris Gheysens to Our Customers</strong></p>
<strong>December 19, 2019</strong>

<p><strong><u>NOTICE OF DATA BREACH</u></strong></p>

<div><p>
Dear Wawa Customers,</p><p>

At Wawa, the people who come through our doors every day are not just customers, you are our friends and neighbors, and nothing is more important than honoring and protecting your trust.&nbsp; Today, I am very sorry to share with you that Wawa has experienced a data security incident.&nbsp; Our information security team discovered malware on Wawa payment processing servers on December 10, 2019, and contained it by December 12, 2019.&nbsp; This malware affected customer payment card information used at potentially all Wawa locations beginning at different points in time after March 4, 2019 and until it was contained.&nbsp; At this time, we believe this malware no longer poses a risk to Wawa customers using payment cards at Wawa, and this malware never posed a risk to our ATM cash machines.</p><p>

I want to reassure you that you will not be responsible for any fraudulent charges on your payment cards related to this incident, as described in the detailed information below.&nbsp; Please review this entire letter carefully to learn about the resources Wawa is providing and the steps you should take now to protect your information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>

I apologize deeply to all of you, our friends and neighbors, for this incident.&nbsp; You are my top priority and are critically important to all of the nearly 37,000 associates at Wawa.&nbsp;We take this special relationship with you and the protection of your information very seriously.&nbsp; I can assure you that throughout this process, everyone at Wawa has followed our longstanding values and has worked quickly and diligently to address this issue and inform our customers as quickly as possible.</p></div>

<p><strong><strong>What Happened?</strong></strong><br>
Based on our investigation to date, we understand that at different points in time after March 4, 2019, malware began running on in-store payment processing systems at potentially all Wawa locations.&nbsp; Although the dates may vary and some Wawa locations may not have been affected at all, this malware was present on most store systems by approximately April 22, 2019.&nbsp; Our information security team identified this malware on December 10, 2019, and by December 12, 2019, they had blocked and contained this malware.&nbsp; We also immediately initiated an investigation, notified law enforcement and payment card companies, and engaged a leading external forensics firm to support our response efforts.&nbsp; Because of the immediate steps we took after discovering this malware, we believe that as of December 12, 2019, this malware no longer poses a risk to customers using payment cards at Wawa.&nbsp;</p>

<div><p><strong>What Information Was Involved?</strong><br>
Based on our investigation to date, this malware affected payment card information, including credit and debit card numbers, expiration dates, and cardholder names on payment cards used at potentially all Wawa in-store payment terminals and fuel dispensers beginning at different points in time after March 4, 2019 and ending on December 12, 2019.&nbsp; Most locations were affected as of April 22, 2019, however, some locations may not have been affected at all.&nbsp; No other personal information was accessed by this malware.&nbsp; Debit card PIN numbers, credit card CVV2 numbers (the three or four-digit security code printed on the card), other PIN numbers, and driver’s license information used to verify age-restricted purchases were not affected by this malware.&nbsp; If you did not use a payment card at a Wawa in-store payment terminal or fuel dispenser during the relevant time frame, your information was not affected by this malware.&nbsp; At this time, we are not aware of any unauthorized use of any payment card information as a result of this incident.&nbsp; The ATM cash machines in our stores were not involved in this incident.&nbsp;</p><p>

<strong>What We Are Doing&nbsp;</strong><br>
As soon as we discovered this malware on December 10, 2019, we took immediate steps to contain it, and by December 12, 2019, we had blocked and contained it.&nbsp; We believe this malware no longer poses a risk to customers using payment cards at Wawa.&nbsp; As indicated above, we engaged a leading external forensics firm to conduct an investigation, which has allowed us to provide the information that we are now able to share in this letter.&nbsp; We are also working with law enforcement to support their ongoing criminal investigation.&nbsp; We continue to take steps to enhance the security of our systems.&nbsp; We have also arranged for a dedicated toll-free call center (1-844-386-9559) to answer customer questions and offer credit monitoring and identity theft protection without charge to anyone whose information may have been involved, which you can sign up for as described below.&nbsp;</p><p>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><u>Review Your Payment Card Account Statements.</u> We encourage you to remain vigilant by reviewing your payment card account statements. If you believe there is an unauthorized charge on your payment card, please notify the relevant payment card company by calling the number on the back of the card.&nbsp; Under federal law and card company rules, customers who notify their payment card company in a timely manner upon discovering fraudulent charges will not be responsible for those charges.</li>

<strong><u>REFERENCE GUIDE</u></strong><br>
&nbsp;In the event that you suspect that you are a victim of identity theft, we encourage you to remain vigilant and consider taking the following steps:</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong><u>Order Your Free Credit Report.</u></strong>&nbsp; To order your free credit report, visit <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com/" target="_blank">www.annualcreditreport.com</a>, call toll-free at 1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s website at www.ftc.gov and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.&nbsp; Do not contact the three credit bureaus individually; they provide your free report only through the website or toll-free number.</p><p>
&nbsp;
When you receive your credit report, review the entire report carefully.&nbsp; Look for any inaccuracies and/or accounts you don’t recognize, and notify the credit bureaus as soon as possible in the event there are any.</p><p>
&nbsp;
You have rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”).&nbsp; These include, among others, the right to know what is in your file; to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information; and to have consumer reporting agencies correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information.&nbsp; For more information about the FCRA, please visit <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf</a> or <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/" target="_blank">www.ftc.gov.</a></p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong><u>Place a Fraud Alert on Your Credit File:</u>&nbsp; </strong>To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file.&nbsp; A fraud alert helps protect you against the possibility of an identity thief opening new credit accounts in your name.&nbsp; When a merchant checks the credit history of someone applying for credit, the merchant gets a notice that the applicant may be a victim of identity theft.&nbsp; The alert notifies the merchant to take steps to verify the identity of the applicant.&nbsp; You can report potential identity theft to all three of the major credit bureaus by calling any one of the toll-free fraud numbers below.&nbsp; You will reach an automated telephone system that allows you to flag your file with a fraud alert at all three bureaus.</p><p>

The credit bureaus may require that you provide proper identification prior to honoring your request.&nbsp; In order to request a security freeze, you will need to provide the following information:</p></div>

<ol>
	<li>Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.)</li>
	<li>Social Security number</li>
	<li>Date of birth</li>

	<li>Proof of current address, such as a current utility bill or telephone bill</li>
	<li>A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver’s license or ID card, military identification, etc.)</li>
	<li>If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of either the police report, investigative report, or complaint to law enforcement agency concerning identity theft.</li>
</ol>

<div><p>Placing a security freeze on your credit file may delay, interfere with, or prevent timely approval of any requests you make for credit, loans, employment, housing or other services.&nbsp; For more information regarding credit freezes, please contact the credit reporting agencies directly.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong><u>Contact the U.S. Federal Trade Commission</u></strong></p><u>.</u><p>&nbsp; If you detect any incident of identity theft or fraud, promptly report the incident to your local law enforcement authorities, your state Attorney General, and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”).&nbsp; If you believe your identity has been stolen, the FTC recommends that you take these additional steps.</p></div>

<ul>
	<li>Close the accounts that you have confirmed or believe have been tampered with or opened fraudulently.&nbsp; Use the FTC’s ID Theft Affidavit (available at www.ftc.gov/idtheft) when you dispute new unauthorized accounts.</li>
	<li>File a local police report.&nbsp; Obtain a copy of the police report and submit it to your creditors and any others that may require proof of the identity theft crime.</li>

Our Wawa Information Security team discovered malware on Wawa payment processing servers on December 10, 2019 and contained it by December 12, 2019.&nbsp; This malware affected customer payment card information used at potentially all Wawa locations beginning at different points in time after March 4, 2019 and until it was contained.&nbsp; The information involved was limited to payment card data, including card number, expiration date, and cardholder name.&nbsp; Debit card PIN numbers, credit card CVV2 numbers (the three or four-digit security code printed on the card), other PIN numbers, and driver’s license information used to verify age-restricted purchases were not affected by this malware.&nbsp; The ATM cash machines in our stores were not involved in this incident.&nbsp;<p>
&nbsp;
<strong>Am I impacted?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
At this time, we believe that most, or potentially all Wawa retail stores were affected at different points in time after March 4, 2019 and ending on December 12, 2019. Only customers who used payment cards during the March 4, 2019 to December 12, 2019 timeframe are potentially involved.&nbsp; The information involved was limited to payment card data, including card number, expiration date, and cardholder name.&nbsp; Debit card PIN numbers, credit card CVV2 numbers (the three or four-digit security code printed on the card), other PIN numbers, and driver’s license information used to verify age-restricted purchases were not affected by this malware.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>Is it safe to use my payment card at Wawa?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Because of the immediate steps Wawa took to contain the malware, Wawa believes that as of December 12, 2019, this malware no longer poses a risk to customers using payment cards at Wawa.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>Will I have to pay for fraudulent charges on my payment card?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Generally speaking, payment cardholders are not responsible for fraudulent charges that are reported in a timely manner to the bank or financial institution that issued their payment card.&nbsp; Accordingly, Wawa customers, like any payment cardholder, should review charges on your payment card statement and promptly report any unauthorized charges to the bank or financial institution that issued their payment card by calling the number on the back of the card.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>What is the company doing?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
As soon as Wawa discovered this malware on December 10, 2019, we took steps to contain it and by December 12, 2019, Wawa had blocked and contained it.&nbsp; We engaged a leading external forensics firm to conduct an investigation and to support our efforts to provide customers with meaningful details about what information may be involved.&nbsp; In addition, we notified law enforcement and payment card companies.&nbsp; We also engaged Experian to provide a dedicated call center to answer questions and enroll potentially impacted individuals in credit monitoring and identity protection services at no charge to the impacted individuals. Details are available in the Credit Monitoring section of this website.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>Were purchases at Wawa fuel pumps affected?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Yes, both in-store payment terminals and fuel dispensers were affected during the relevant time period.</p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>Is there any impact from this incident to Wawa gift cards?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
The malware may have captured some information about Wawa gift card numbers.&nbsp; However, Wawa believes that Wawa gift cards were not the target of this incident. In the meantime, if there is a problem with your Wawa gift card, please contact the Wawa Contact Center at 1-800-444-9292.</p><p>
