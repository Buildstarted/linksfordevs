In the last article, we looked at
<a href="https://jeremybytes.blogspot.com/2020/05/post-build-events-and-net-core.html" target="_blank">post-build events and .NET Core</a>
-- specifically how the '$(SolutionDir)' and other macros based on the solution
folder do not work when we do project-based builds. Instead, we should use
folders relative to the project.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cuc0VdfmFQ4/XrQsyjxQu-I/AAAAAAAAJlM/qrgGFAXBm4k9rZBY-KkkMJ8kMb0NZkDtwCK4BGAsYHg/01-PostBuild-Project.png"><img data-original-height="82" data-original-width="498" height="106" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cuc0VdfmFQ4/XrQsyjxQu-I/AAAAAAAAJlM/qrgGFAXBm4k9rZBY-KkkMJ8kMb0NZkDtwCK4BGAsYHg/w640-h106/01-PostBuild-Project.png" width="640"></a>
</p>
<p><span face="courier">&nbsp; &nbsp; xcopy "$(ProjectDir)AdditionalFiles*.*" "$(TargetDir)"
  /Y</span></p><p>

This works fine for Windows-based projects (like the WPF project used in the
previous article), but it fails when we move to a cross-platform environment.
"xcopy" doesn't exist on macOS or Linux.</p><p>

Fortunately, we can dig into MSBuild a little deeper and create tasks that copy
files in a platform-agnostic manner. Here's a preview of the build task that
does the same things as above:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nfsT21pdvOc/XrQtzhLIdzI/AAAAAAAAJlo/RbDp8ZMhlccb1cDPKOu0YLtsFup3HhgeQCK4BGAsYHg/03-CrossPlatformCopy.png"><img data-original-height="396" data-original-width="1195" height="212" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nfsT21pdvOc/XrQtzhLIdzI/AAAAAAAAJlo/RbDp8ZMhlccb1cDPKOu0YLtsFup3HhgeQCK4BGAsYHg/w640-h212/03-CrossPlatformCopy.png" width="640"></a>
</p><p>
Let's dig into some code.</p><p><span size="4"><b> MSBuild Tasks</b></span><br>MSBuild (the build tool in the .NET world) has a number of Tasks that we
can use as part of the build process. These go right into our project files.</p><p>

In fact, when we add a post-build event through the Visual Studio project
settings editor, we end up with an MSBuild task in the project file. For
example, our "xcopy" command that we saw above:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Mk8WskQDLKc/XrQweG2WAPI/AAAAAAAAJmE/UUAcMFhe3QIS6WGFDFwXP6yrf9xSXlMSgCK4BGAsYHg/01-PostBuild-Project.png"><img data-original-height="82" data-original-width="498" height="106" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Mk8WskQDLKc/XrQweG2WAPI/AAAAAAAAJmE/UUAcMFhe3QIS6WGFDFwXP6yrf9xSXlMSgCK4BGAsYHg/w640-h106/01-PostBuild-Project.png" width="640"></a>
</p>
<p>
Ends up in the project file looking like this:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QlkQ4yP8Eus/XrQwjPt5BcI/AAAAAAAAJmQ/cpCn9o-BbyoOXdCSvk4tF5TPP0tuCHBVwCK4BGAsYHg/03-ProjectFileXcopy.png"><img data-original-height="97" data-original-width="1228" height="50" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QlkQ4yP8Eus/XrQwjPt5BcI/AAAAAAAAJmQ/cpCn9o-BbyoOXdCSvk4tF5TPP0tuCHBVwCK4BGAsYHg/w640-h50/03-ProjectFileXcopy.png" width="640"></a>
</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
  <span face="courier">&nbsp; &lt;Target Name="PostBuild" AfterTargets="PostBuildEvent"&gt;</span><br>
  <span face="courier">&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Exec Command="xcopy
    &amp;quot;$(SolutionDir)AdditionalFiles*.*&amp;quot;
    &amp;quot;$(TargetDir)&amp;quot; /Y" /&gt;</span><br>
  <span face="courier">&nbsp; &lt;/Target&gt;</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
This uses the "Exec" task to run a command at the command prompt.</p><p>

So we're already using MSBuild tasks. Fortunately for us, there are other tasks
to choose from besides "Exec".</p><p><span size="4"><b>The Copy Task</b></span></p><p>

On the Microsoft Docs site, we can see the tasks that are built in:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-task-reference?view=vs-2019" target="_blank">MSBuild task reference</a>. One of those is the Copy task (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/copy-task?view=vs-2019" target="_blank">docs reference for Copy task</a>).</p><p>

For today's examples, I'll be showing the cross-platform examples from my C#
Interfaces talk:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jeremybytes/understanding-interfaces-core31" target="_blank">https://github.com/jeremybytes/understanding-interfaces-core31</a>. There are 2 specific project files that I'll link to as we go.</p><p>

Let's look at our new copy task and see what's going on (this code is available
in the "PeopleViewer.csproj" file at this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jeremybytes/understanding-interfaces-core31/blob/master/web/completed/04-DynamicLoading-Plugin/PeopleViewer/PeopleViewer.csproj" target="_blank">PeopleViewer.csproj</a>&nbsp;-- specifically lines 17-26):</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrjs2AzW4zw/XrQzx2R7S4I/AAAAAAAAJm0/2cYH_phLDSo0SPz8zS9kdgHSdyoVuvn9gCK4BGAsYHg/03-CrossPlatformCopy.png"><img data-original-height="396" data-original-width="1195" height="212" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrjs2AzW4zw/XrQzx2R7S4I/AAAAAAAAJm0/2cYH_phLDSo0SPz8zS9kdgHSdyoVuvn9gCK4BGAsYHg/w640-h212/03-CrossPlatformCopy.png" width="640"></a>
</p>
<p>
First, let's look at the "Target". This is a grouping that tells when this task
is going to run. Notice that "AfterTargets" parameter is set to "Build". So this
will run after the build. If the build fails, then this will not run.</p><p>

Inside, we have the "Copy" task itself. We are using 3 parameters: (1)
SourceFiles, (2) DestinationFolder, and (3) SkipUnchangedFiles.</p><p>
<b> "SourceFiles" is a required parameter</b>. This is an array that
specifies the files that we want to copy. Since this is an array, we create our
own element called "DataFiles". The "Include" parameter has a list of the files
that we want to include. We can still use the build macros, so "$(ProjectDir)"
works just fine here. In this case, we only have one item in our array (our one
item happens to include a wildcard "*.*").</p><p>

The value for the "SourceFiles" parameter is the item created in the ItemGroup
above. We reference it with using "@(DataFiles)".</p><p>

As an alternative to using wildcards, we can specify individual files separated by semi-colons. An
example of this is shown on the Microsoft Docs site:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/copy-task?view=vs-2019#example" target="_blank">Example (with multiple files)</a>&nbsp;-- screenshot below (but be sure to follow the link):</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-k2TIXi0n1sk/XrWAhdcCCMI/AAAAAAAAJok/qSDxZubfYOMJMeDyV2EdNKK4C36UwzEIQCK4BGAsYHg/00-Microsof_Example1.png"><img data-original-height="412" data-original-width="828" height="318" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-k2TIXi0n1sk/XrWAhdcCCMI/AAAAAAAAJok/qSDxZubfYOMJMeDyV2EdNKK4C36UwzEIQCK4BGAsYHg/w640-h318/00-Microsof_Example1.png" width="640"></a></p>
<p><b>"DestinationFolder" is a kind-of-required parameter.</b> This has the
destination for the files to be copied. If the folder does not exist, then it is
created automatically. Our value for this folder is the "$(TargetDir)" that we
had in the "xcopy" version.</p><p>

<b>"DestinationFiles" is a kind-of-required parameter.</b>&nbsp;You'll notice
that we do not have a "DestinationFiles" parameter for our copy task. This is
because we can use either "DestinationFolder" or "DestinationFiles", but not
both (and we need at to have at least one of them). The "DestinationFiles"
parameter is also an array, and it expects a one-to-one mapping of items from
the "SourceFiles" array.</p><p>

<b>"SkipUnchangedFiles" is an optional parameter.</b> This will not copy files
that are unchanged between the source and the destination. It determines this
based on the file size and the timestamp.</p><p>

There are a number of other interesting parameters, so you should
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/copy-task?view=vs-2019#parameters" target="_blank">take a look at the docs</a>. For example, "UseHardlinksIfPossible" will create links to the files rather
than copying them.</p><p>

<b>Recursive Copying</b><br>
Many times we need to copy entire folder structures (including subfolders). The
good news is that we can do that with the copy task as well. For more
information, take a look at the example on the Microsoft Docs site:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/copy-task?view=vs-2019#example-1" target="_blank">Example (recursive copy)</a>&nbsp;-- screenshot below (but be sure to follow the link):</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UYsRyNJkA6Y/XrWBJLpVz6I/AAAAAAAAJo4/mq-_4O4d2VoNSLEee4E_0tX-8wdTwlPugCK4BGAsYHg/00-Microsof_Example2.png"><img data-original-height="307" data-original-width="979" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UYsRyNJkA6Y/XrWBJLpVz6I/AAAAAAAAJo4/mq-_4O4d2VoNSLEee4E_0tX-8wdTwlPugCK4BGAsYHg/w640-h200/00-Microsof_Example2.png" width="640"></a></p>

<p><span size="4"><b>A Lot of Effort?</b></span><br>
This seems like a lot of effort compared to our previous post-build event.
<a href="https://jeremybytes.blogspot.com/2014/02/using-build-events-in-visual-studio-to.html" target="_blank">With the post-build event</a>, we can use the Visual Studio project editor to build our commands and insert
macros. Here, we need to edit our project files by hand.
<b>But it is totally worth it</b>. This command works on Windows, macOS, and
Linux -- and yes, I have tried it in all of those environments.</p><p>

Before I found the MSBuild tasks, I was thinking about how I would get around
this. Could I put in different commands (like using "xcopy" for Windows and "cp"
for macOS), and then add some sort of conditional? That is technically possible,
but it is a lot more brittle when all I need to do is copy some files.</p><p>

I definitely prefer to use the build task.</p><p><span size="4"><b>OS-Specific Tasks</b></span><br>
I ran into an issue where I needed to copy different files based on the OS, so I
ended up digging into conditional MSBuild tasks.</p><p>

For my specific issue, I have a library that uses SQLite to access a local
database file. I need to do runtime binding to this library, so I need all of
the required files in a shared location. The problem is that SQLite has
different runtime files for each environment. For Windows, it uses
"e_sqlite3.dll", for macOS it uses "libe_sqlite3.dylib", and for Linux it uses
"libe_sqlite3.so". I needed to figure out how to get the right file to the
output folder.</p><p>

The MSBuild tasks for this are in the "PersonReader.SQL.csproj" file which is
on GitHub:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jeremybytes/understanding-interfaces-core31/blob/master/web/completed/04-DynamicLoading-Plugin/PersonReader.SQL/PersonReader.SQL.csproj" target="_blank">PersonReader.SQL.csproj</a>.</p><p>

<b>Windows-Specific Task</b><br>
To get started with conditional tasks, let's look at the task that copies over
the Windows-specific SQLite file (this is on lines 31-41 of the
<a href="https://github.com/jeremybytes/understanding-interfaces-core31/blob/master/web/completed/04-DynamicLoading-Plugin/PersonReader.SQL/PersonReader.SQL.csproj" target="_blank">PersonReader.SQL.csproj file</a>):</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-codF0JgkzA8/XrQ-8PsUMlI/AAAAAAAAJnQ/-3BenAWNFVggNEUiiCb3320hnL2gFOUMgCK4BGAsYHg/04-WindowsEvent.png"><img data-original-height="433" data-original-width="1428" height="194" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-codF0JgkzA8/XrQ-8PsUMlI/AAAAAAAAJnQ/-3BenAWNFVggNEUiiCb3320hnL2gFOUMgCK4BGAsYHg/w640-h194/04-WindowsEvent.png" width="640"></a>
</p>
<p>
Overall, this task looks similar to what we saw above. One difference is that
the Target has a "Condition" parameter.</p><blockquote>
  <p><span face="courier">Condition=" '$(OS)' == 'Windows_NT' "</span>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>

"Condition" lets us put in a restriction on when this task will run. For this
example, we can look at the '$(OS)' value to see if we are running under
Windows. If so, then it runs the copy task.</p><p>

For more details on the types of conditions that we can use here, check out the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-conditions?view=vs-2019" target="_blank">MSBuild conditions article</a>
on Microsoft Docs.</p><p>

<b>macOS-Specific Task</b><br>
It seems like doing the same thing for macOS should be straight-forward: just
change the condition to use "macOS". Unfortunately, that does not work here. The
'$(OS)' values are not specific enough for what we need. If we run on macOS, we
get the value of "Unix" (since macOS is a Unix-based system). The problem
is that for Linux, the value is also "Unix". So the "$(OS)" value is not
helpful.</p><p>

Fortunately, there is another option. Here is the code (from lines 43-53 of the
same
<a href="https://github.com/jeremybytes/understanding-interfaces-core31/blob/master/web/completed/04-DynamicLoading-Plugin/PersonReader.SQL/PersonReader.SQL.csproj" target="_blank">PersonReader.SQL.csproj file</a>):</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EHpAT68kDy8/XrRBX6AbLiI/AAAAAAAAJns/4wDE1o8ehYAP_cyLx_JHpF0l4wFZ8PnHwCK4BGAsYHg/05-MacOSEvent.png"><img data-original-height="295" data-original-width="1753" height="108" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EHpAT68kDy8/XrRBX6AbLiI/AAAAAAAAJns/4wDE1o8ehYAP_cyLx_JHpF0l4wFZ8PnHwCK4BGAsYHg/w640-h108/05-MacOSEvent.png" width="640"></a>
</p>
<p>
This condition is a bit harder to understand because things are fully-qualified. So before we look at this condition,
let's look at this another way: as C# code.</p><p>

<b>Checking the OS in C#</b><br>
If we wanted to check for the OS in C#, we can use the "RuntimeTypeInformation"
class that is part of System.Runtime.InteropServices. Here's the code:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EDI0BL5xNDg/XrRCPoHSL8I/AAAAAAAAJoE/v6xUMBHdS6k-vyEpYimxSwFWUUaP-gJDACK4BGAsYHg/06-IsOSPlatform.png"><img data-original-height="156" data-original-width="963" height="104" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EDI0BL5xNDg/XrRCPoHSL8I/AAAAAAAAJoE/v6xUMBHdS6k-vyEpYimxSwFWUUaP-gJDACK4BGAsYHg/w640-h104/06-IsOSPlatform.png" width="640"></a>
</p>

<p><span face="courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.OSX))
  {}</span></p><p>

The "IsOSPlatform" method takes an enum value (OSPlatform) as a parameter. So we
can use this method to check whether something is running under Windows, macOS
(i.e. OSX), or Linux.</p><p>

For those of you who are new to macOS, the operating system was renamed from
"OSX" to "macOS" a few years back. Since it is generally a bad idea to change
enums that are already in use, we'll see "OSX" in various places when
referencing the Apple OS.</p><p>

<b>Back to the MSBuild Condition</b><br>
The condition that we have in the MSBuild task above uses this same
"IsOSPlatform" method, but the syntax is a little different because it is in the
MSBuild format and also because the names are fully-qualified.</p><blockquote>
  <p><span face="courier">Condition="'$([System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation]::IsOSPlatform($([System.Runtime.InteropServices.OSPlatform]::OSX)))'"</span>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
If we pull out the fully-qualified parts, we get something a bit more
readable:</p><blockquote>
  <p><span face="courier">Condition="'$([RuntimeInformation]::IsOSPlatform($([OSPlatform]::OSX)))'"</span>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
The syntax is still different, but it's easier to see that we are calling the
"IsOSPlatform" method on the "RuntimeInformation" class, and that we are passing
in the equivalent of "OSPlatform.OSX" as a parameter.</p><p>

Now this will not work unless it is fully-qualified, so we need to use the long
version in our MSBuild task.</p><p>

<b>Linux-Specific Build Task</b><br>
The task for Linux is similar to the macOS task. If you're interested, you can
look at the code in the
<a href="https://github.com/jeremybytes/understanding-interfaces-core31/blob/master/web/completed/04-DynamicLoading-Plugin/PersonReader.SQL/PersonReader.SQL.csproj" target="_blank">PersonReader.SQL.csproj file</a>
(lines 55-65).</p><p><span size="4"><b>Wrap Up</b></span></p><p>

Now we have a post-build copy command that works cross-platform. And we also
have some conditional commands that run based on what operating system we are
building on. This gives us quite a bit of flexibility in building truly
cross-platform applications.</p><p>

MSBuild is quite an extensive system, and there are tons of options. The
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-task-reference?view=vs-2019#in-this-section" target="_blank">MSBuild task reference</a>
has a list of built-in tasks. In addition, you can create custom build tasks if
needed (although that is something I am not likely to do myself).</p><p>

One of the most interesting things to me about .NET Core is the cross-platform
capabilities. As I move my applications forward, I think about how I can make
them easier to run cross-platform. This gives a bigger audience for the
applications and also provides different options for deployment.</p><p>

Copying files in a way that is friendly to multiple operating systems is just
one of the things we need to think about when creating cross-platform
applications. Be sure to check back; I'll continue to document
things I come across as I move projects over.</p><p>

Happy Coding!
