The hacker is offering to sell data of 9 million Zoomcar users for $300.</p><p>"Zoomcar has a high privacy bar with strict data protection standards. Our customers data is absolutely secure," said a Zoomcar spokesperson. </p><p>Greg Moran, Co-founder &amp; CEO, Zoomcar further added, "The assertion pertaining to a breach of Zoomcar user’s password data is patently untrue. All Zoomcar data, including user passwords, is encrypted with strong algorithms that make it impossible for anyone to access. Moreover, we have a strict password rotation policy across all our assets along with a robust Akamai security layer. Furthermore, Zoomcar routinely works with external security auditors (including Big 4 audit firms) to ensure our systems &amp; processes remain robust and best-in-class at all times. </p><p>Zoomcar competes with other self-drive car rental startups such as Drivezy and Revv. </p><p>“The hacker has been privately selling the data for $300 but now he has made it public on the Dark Web,” said Rajshekhar Rajaharia, the cybersecurity consultant who alerted Zoomcar about the hacker’s plan.</p><p>The data breach took place in July 2018, according to the hacker.</p><p>Hackers avoid offering the stolen data for sale soon after a breach since that makes it easier for law enforcement officials to track their <a href="https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet">internet</a> protocol (IP) addresses, Rajaharia said. Selling the data after a year makes it difficult to track the source of the breach. Zoomcar did not reply to an email seeking comment.</p><p>In January, Zoomcar <a href="https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/startups/zoomcar-raises-30m-funding-led-by-sonys-venture-arm/73451807" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank">raised $30 million</a> (Rs 213 crore) in a fresh funding round led by Sony Innovation Fund, the venture arm of Japanese electronics giant Sony, as part of its ongoing $100 million Series D round. </p></div></div><br><div><p>Follow and connect with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/ETtech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" aria-label="Follow On Twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/ETTech/968396013188188" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" aria-label="Follow On Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/ETTech-6811514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Linkedin</a></p></div></div></div></div>
