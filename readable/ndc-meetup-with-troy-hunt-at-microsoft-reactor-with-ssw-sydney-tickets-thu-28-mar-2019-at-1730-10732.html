<p><strong>Clouds, Codes, and Cybers - Troy Hunt</strong></p>
<p><span>Just over 5 years ago now, I started a little project called Have I Been Pwned. It was built on a shoestring but quickly became the de facto standard for checking personal exposure on the internet and these days can see many millions of people in a day searching through many<span> </span><i>billions</i><span> </span>of records. I still run it on a shoestring but only because of access to new cloud technologies from Microsoft and Cloudflare. In fact, what Iâ€™ve found is that over time the service has actually become<span> </span><i>cheaper</i><span> </span>to run whilst supporting massively increased traffic loads and hosting more data than ever.</span></p>
<p><span>Clouds, Codes, and Cybers is a casual user group session that gives you a peek under the covers of how HIBP runs. Iâ€™ll walk you through the Azure constructs that make it possible, where Iâ€™ve failed and indeed where Iâ€™ve actually made some good decisions! Youâ€™ll see behind the scenes of not just the code that powers HIBP, but how the data is obtained and ultimately made publicly searchable. Itâ€™s a super casual session so come armed with questions and join me in Sydney.</span></p>

<p><strong>About Troy Hunt</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Troy Hunt, is an Australian Microsoft Regional Director and Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for Developer Security. He doesnâ€™t work for Microsoft, but they're kind enough to recognize his community contributions by way of their award programs which he has been a part of since 2011. You'll regularly find him in the press talking about security and even testifying before US Congress on the impact of data breaches.</span></span></p>
