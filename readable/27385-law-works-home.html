Patriots of all parties must stop this President from running roughshod over the Constitution we are all sworn to defend.” <span class="bottom-arrow"></span></p><span>Donald Ayer</span><span class="title">Former Deputy Attorney General under President George H.W. Bush</span></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Mueller does not accuse the president of crimes. He doesn’t have to. But the facts he recounts describe criminal behavior. They describe criminal behavior even if we allow the president’s—and the attorney general’s—argument that facially valid exercises of presidential authority cannot be obstructions of justice. They do this because they describe obstructive activity that does not involve facially valid exercises of presidential power at all.” <span class="bottom-arrow"></span></p><span>Benjamin Wittes</span><span class="title">Editor-in-Chief of Lawfare</span></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The president’s job is to enforce federal law. If he had ordered its violation to save innocent life or preserve human freedom, he would have a moral defense. But ordering obstruction to save himself from the consequences of his own behavior is unlawful, defenseless and condemnable.” <span class="bottom-arrow"></span></p><span>Andrew Napolitano</span><span class="title">Former Superior Court Judge and Fox Legal Analyst </span></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Our fellow citizens deserve to know that truth, and our Congress needs to wrestle with it because that’s their job: they have a responsibility under the Constitution to keep an eye on the executive branch and make sure our laws and our founding documents are being treated with respect.” <span class="bottom-arrow"></span></p><span>William Nettles</span><span class="title">Former US Attorney from South Carolina</span></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Mueller’s report identifies multiple examples of conduct satisfying all the elements of obstruction of justice, and undoubtedly any person who is not the president of the United States would be indicted based on such evidence.” <span class="bottom-arrow"></span></p><span>Justin Amash</span><span class="title">Republican Congressman </span></blockquote><blockquote><p>“If there is to be another chapter in the Russia investigation, it will be written not by the Special Counsel – but by the lawmakers, elected to represent the American people.” <span class="bottom-arrow"></span></p><span>Shep Smith</span><span class="title">Fox News Host</span></blockquote></div></div></div></div>
