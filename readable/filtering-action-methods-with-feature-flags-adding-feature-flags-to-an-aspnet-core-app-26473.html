<p>In the <a href="https://andrewlock.net/introducing-the-microsoft-featuremanagement-library-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-1/">first post</a> in this series, I introduced the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FeatureManagement/1.0.0-preview-009000001-1251"><em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em> library</a>, and showed how to use it to add feature flags to an ASP.NET Core app. </p>
<p>In this post, I introduce the companion <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore/1.0.0-preview-009000001-1251"><em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore</em> library</a>. This library adds ASP.NET Core-specific features for working with feature flags, such as Tag Helpers and Action Filters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em> was introduced in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmd0Vh6pFfE">recent .NET Community Standup</a> and is currently in preview, so some details may change when it's properly released.</p>

<p><em>24th June 2019</em>: updated with <a href="https://disq.us/p/22l3uis">changes highlighted by Jimmy Campbell</a>.</p>

<h2 id="asp-net-core-specific-feature-flag-integration">ASP.NET Core-specific feature flag integration<a href="#asp-net-core-specific-feature-flag-integration"></a></h2>
<p>As I described in my <a href="https://andrewlock.net/introducing-the-microsoft-featuremanagement-library-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-1/">previous post</a>, the <em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em> library is a .NET Standard 2.0 library that builds on top of the <em>Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration</em>. It provides a standardised way of adding feature flags to an application. </p>
<p>There's nothing ASP.NET Core-specific in this base library, so you're free to use it in any .NET Standard 2.0 app. However, there's an additional library, <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore/1.0.0-preview-009000001-1251"><em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore</em></a>, that <em>does</em> depend on ASP.NET Core, which contains various helper functions and extension methods for working with feature flags. These are described <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/use-feature-flags-dotnet-core">in the documentation</a> (the library isn't open-sourced yet), and include some of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#removing-an-mvc-action-using-the-featuregate-attribute">Action filters to remove MVC actions based on whether a feature is enabled.</a></li>
<li><a href="#hiding-links-in-views-for-disabled-features">A Tag Helper for conditionally hiding sections of UI based on features.</a></li>
<li>Extension methods for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/use-feature-flags-dotnet-core#route">conditionally registering routes</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/use-feature-flags-dotnet-core#mvc-filter">global filters</a>, or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/use-feature-flags-dotnet-core#middleware">middleware</a>, based on whether a feature is enabled. </li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, I'll show how to use MVC action filters to conditionally remove MVC actions, the <code>FeatureTagHelper</code> to hide sections of the UI, and an <code>IDisabledFeaturesHandler</code> to provide custom behaviour if a user attempts to access an action hidden behind a feature flag.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-project">Setting up the project<a href="#setting-up-the-project"></a></h2>
<p>I'm going to start with a simple ASP.NET Core application, the same as in the last post. If you've already tried out the process from that post, you can just replace the reference to <em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em> with a reference to <em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore</em>. </p>
<pre><code>dotnet add package Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore --version 1.0.0-preview-009000001-1251
</code></pre>
<p>After adding it, your <em>.csproj</em> should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Project</span> <span>Sdk</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>PropertyGroup</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>TargetFramework</span><span>&gt;</span></span>netcoreapp2.2<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>TargetFramework</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>AspNetCoreHostingModel</span><span>&gt;</span></span>InProcess<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>AspNetCoreHostingModel</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>PropertyGroup</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>ItemGroup</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>PackageReference</span> <span>Include</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Microsoft.AspNetCore.App<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>

  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>ItemGroup</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Project</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Next, register the required services in <code>Startup.ConfigureServices()</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Startup</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        services<span>.</span><span>AddFeatureManagement</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And add the necessary configuration for a simple boolean feature flag <code>Beta</code> to <em>appsettings.json</em></p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"FeatureManagement"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"Beta"</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, create a static helper class for referencing your feature in code:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>FeatureFlags</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>const</span> <span>string</span> Beta <span>=</span> <span>"Beta"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That's the basic project configured, so now we'll use some of the features provided by <em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore</em>.</p>
<h2 id="removing-an-mvc-action-using-the-featuregate-attribute">Removing an MVC action using the <code>[FeatureGate]</code> attribute<a href="#removing-an-mvc-action-using-the-featuregate-attribute"></a></h2>
<p>Let's imagine you have a "traditional" MVC controller (as opposed to a Razor Page) that you only want to be available when the <code>Beta</code> feature flag is enabled. You can decorate the controller (or specific actions) with the <code>[FeatureGate]</code> (previously <code>[Feature]</code>) attribute, providing the name of the feature as an argument:</p>
<pre><code><span>using</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>AspNetCore<span>.</span>Mvc<span>;</span>
<span>using</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>FeatureManagement<span>.</span>Mvc<span>;</span>

<span>[</span><span>FeatureGate</span><span>(</span>FeatureFlags<span>.</span>Beta<span>)</span><span>]</span> 
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>BetaController</span> <span>:</span> <span>Controller</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>IActionResult</span> <span>Index</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>View</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you try to navigate to this page (<code>/Beta</code>) when the feature is enabled, you'll see the View rendered as expected:</p>
<p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2019/featureflag_in_beta_feature.png" alt="Viewing the beta page"></p>
<p>However, if the <code>Beta</code> feature flag is disabled, you'll get a 404 when trying to view the page:</p>
<p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2019/featureflag_in_not_found.png" alt="Viewing the beta page when disabled gives a 404"></p>
<p>It's as though the controller doesn't exist at all. That's maybe not the best experience from the user's perspective, so we'll customise this shortly.</p>
<p>The <code>[FeatureGate]</code> attribute is <a href="https://andrewlock.net/asp-net-core-in-action-filters/">a standard action filter</a>, so you can apply it to action methods, controllers, base controllers, or globally. However, there's a couple of things to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>[FeatureGate]</code> attribute takes an <em>array</em> of feature flags, in its constructor. If <em>any</em> of those features are enabled, the controller is enabled. <del>Put another way, the filter does an OR check of the features, <em>not</em> an AND.</del> As <a href="https://disq.us/p/22x8o31">Murat Kebabcı mentions</a>, you can now use OR _or_ AND by passing a <code>RequirementType</code> to the filter.</li>
<li>The <code>[FeatureGate]</code> attribute is an <code>IActionFilter</code> <em>not</em> an <code>IPageFilter</code>, so it currently doesn't work on Razor Pages. That seems like an oversight that will surely be fixed before the final release.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="custom-handling-of-missing-actions">Custom handling of missing actions<a href="#custom-handling-of-missing-actions"></a></h2>
<p>As shown in the previous section, if an action is removed due to a feature being disabled, the default is to generate a 404 response. That may be fine for some applications, especially if you're using error handling middleware to customise error responses to avoid ugly "raw" 404. </p>
<p>However, it's also possible that you may want to generate a different response in this situation. Maybe you want to redirect users to a "stable" page, return a "join the waiting list" view, or simply return a different response, like a <code>403 Forbidden</code>. </p>
<p>You can achieve any of these approaches by creating a service that implements the <code>IDisabledFeaturesHandler</code> interface. Implementers are invoked as part of the action filter pipeline, when an action method is "removed" due to a feature being disabled. In the example below, I show how to generate a <code>403 Forbidden</code> response, but you have access to the whole <code>ActionExecutingContext</code> in the method, so you can do anything you can in a standard action filter:</p>
<pre><code><span>using</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>FeatureManagement<span>.</span>Mvc<span>;</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>RedirectDisabledFeatureHandler</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDisabledFeaturesHandler</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Task</span> <span>HandleDisabledFeatures</span><span>(</span>IEnumerable<span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>&gt;</span> features<span>,</span> <span>ActionExecutingContext</span> context<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        context<span>.</span>Result <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>ForbidResult</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
        <span>return</span> Task<span>.</span>CompletedTask<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>To register the handler, update your call to <code>AddFeatureManagement()</code> in <code>Startup.ConfigureServices()</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Startup</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        services<span>.</span><span>AddFeatureManagement</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
            <span>.</span><span>UseDisabledFeaturesHandler</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>RedirectDisabledFeatureHandler</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>With the handler registered, if you now try to access a disabled feature, a 403 response is generated, which is intercepted by the error handling middleware, and you're redirected to the "Access Denied" page for the app:</p>
<p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2019/featureflag_in_beta_not_enabled.png" alt="Instead of a 404, you're redirect to a "></p>
<p>With these features you can disable action methods based on whether a feature is enabled and have fine control over what happens when a disabled feature is accessed. Ideally however, users shouldn't be <em>attempting</em> to call actions for disabled features. </p>
<h2 id="hiding-links-in-views-for-disabled-features">Hiding links in Views for disabled features<a href="#hiding-links-in-views-for-disabled-features"></a></h2>
<p>Generally speaking, you don't want your users to be seeing "Access Denied" pages due to trying to access disabled features. Instead, you should hide the feature-flag-gated functionality in the UI as well. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As with all validation, you can't rely on hiding things client-side. Always use server-side feature flag checks; only hide content in the UI to give a better user experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One way to hide sections in Views would be to inject the <code>IFeatureManager</code> service into <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.2">views using dependency injection</a>. For example, imagine you want to add a link to the <code>BetaController</code> in the navigation bar of your default layout. You could use the <code>@inject</code> directive, and check for the feature manually:</p>
<pre><code>
@inject  Microsoft.FeatureManagement.IFeatureManager _featureManager; 

<span><span><span>&lt;</span>nav</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
        
        @if (_featureManager.IsEnabled(FeatureFlags.Beta))
        {
            <span><span><span>&lt;</span>li</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>nav-item<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
                <span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>nav-link text-dark<span>"</span></span> <span>asp-controller</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Beta<span>"</span></span> <span>asp-action</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Index<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Beta<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
            <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>li</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
        }
    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>nav</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>This approach works fine, but for this example, you could also use the <code>FeatureTagHelper</code> to achieve the same thing but with cleaner markup:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>nav</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
        
        <span><span><span>&lt;</span>feature</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>@FeatureFlags.Beta<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
            <span><span><span>&lt;</span>li</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>nav-item<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
                <span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>nav-link text-dark<span>"</span></span> <span>asp-area</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>"</span></span> <span>asp-controller</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Beta<span>"</span></span> <span>asp-action</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Index<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Beta<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
            <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>li</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
        <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>feature</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>ul</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>nav</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>FeatureTagHelper</code> works for this simple use-case, where you have a single feature flag that must be enabled to show some UI. <del>Unfortunately, if you want to do <em>anything</em> more complicated than that (show different UI if the feature is disabled, check for multiple features) then you'll have to fallback to injecting <code>IFeatureManager</code>.</del> </p>
<blockquote>
<p><del>As mentioned in the <a href="https://youtu.be/cmd0Vh6pFfE?t=1787">.NET community Standup</a>, the team are aware of the limitations with the TagHelper - hopefully they'll be addressed before it's fully released. Personally I wish they would just open source it already, as fixing these things would be easy for the community to do pretty quickly.</del></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>24th June 2019</em>, As <a href="https://disq.us/p/22l3uis">described by Jimmy Campbell</a> the Feature tag helper now also allows rendering markup when a feature flag is <strong>not</strong> enabled, as well as both AND and OR conditions. That should remove most cases where you'd need to manually inject an <code>IFeatureManager</code>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That covers the main MVC features exposed in the <em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore</em> library. So far, I've only demonstrated creating simple feature flags that are just boolean values. In the next post I'll show how you can create more complex (and more interesting!) feature flags by using <em>feature filters</em>. These allow you to customise the feature flags based on the current request, which opens the door to more advanced scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary"></a></h2>
<p>The <em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore</em> library builds on the features in <em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em>, adding ASP.NET Core helpers for working with features flags. It contains action filters for disabling actions that are behind feature flags, tag helpers for conditionally hiding UI elements, and extension methods for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/use-feature-flags-dotnet-core#middleware">customising the ASP.NET Core pipeline</a> based on the enabled features. In the next post I'll show some of the more powerful features of the library that let you use more complex feature flags.</p>
