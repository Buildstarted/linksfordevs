    <main class="talk-main"> <p>With .NET Core, performance counters are no more there to help you monitor .NET metrics such as memory, threadpool or contention in your applications. Even with the .NET Framework, some of the performance counters are far from being accurate. The best replacement solution is to rely on CLR Events to monitor the health of your applications.</p>
<p>This session will first show you how to easily build an accurate .NET monitoring of your applications based on CLR Events; including the Linux case for .NET Core. </p>
<p>Beyond the monitoring use with .NET Core counters, Christophe will drive you into the implementation details to show you how these events can become invaluable during real world debugging and performance investigations. </p>
<p>Last but not least, you will see how to leverage the new .NET Core EventPipe architecture to get accurate metrics about your applications.</p> <br> </main>
