There’s personal and intimate trust. When we say we trust a friend, we mean that we trust their intentions and know that those intentions will inform their actions. There’s also the less intimate, less personal trust—we might not know someone personally, or know their motivations, but we can trust their future actions. Blockchain enables this sort of trust: We don’t know any bitcoin miners, for example, but we trust that they will follow the mining protocol and make the whole system work.</p><p>Most blockchain enthusiasts have a unnaturally narrow definition of trust. They’re fond of catchphrases like “<a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/opinion/bitcoin-boom-technology-trust.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/opinion/bitcoin-boom-technology-trust.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in code we trust</a>,” “<a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Math-We-Trust-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B07C7TPXMD&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Math-We-Trust-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B07C7TPXMD" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in math we trust</a>,” and “<a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://cryptoclothing.org/product/crypto-shirt/&quot;}" href="https://cryptoclothing.org/product/crypto-shirt/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in crypto we trust</a>.” This is trust as verification. But verification isn’t the same as trust.</p><p>In 2012, I wrote a book about trust and security, <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.schneier.com/books/liars_and_outliers/&quot;}" href="https://www.schneier.com/books/liars_and_outliers/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Liars and Outliers</em></a>. In it, I listed four very general systems our species uses to incentivize trustworthy behavior. The first two are morals and reputation. The problem is that they scale only to a certain population size. Primitive systems were good enough for small communities, but larger communities required delegation, and more formalism.</p><p>The third is institutions. Institutions have rules and laws that induce people to behave according to the group norm, imposing sanctions on those who do not. In a sense, laws formalize reputation. Finally, the fourth is security systems. These are the wide varieties of security technologies we employ: door locks and tall fences, alarm systems and guards, forensics and audit systems, and so on.</p><p>These four elements work together to enable trust. Take banking, for example. Financial institutions, merchants, and individuals are all concerned with their reputations, which prevents theft and fraud. The laws and regulations surrounding every aspect of banking keep everyone in line, including backstops that limit risks in the case of fraud. And there are lots of security systems in place, from anti-counterfeiting technologies to internet-security technologies.</p><p>In his 2018 book, <em><a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/blockchain-and-new-architecture-trust&quot;}" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/blockchain-and-new-architecture-trust" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust</a></em>, Kevin Werbach outlines four different “trust architectures.” The first is peer-to-peer trust. This basically corresponds to my morals and reputational systems: pairs of people who come to trust each other. His second is leviathan trust, which corresponds to institutional trust. You can see this working in our system of contracts, which allows parties that don’t trust each other to enter into an agreement because they both trust that a government system will help resolve disputes. His third is intermediary trust. A good example is the credit card system, which allows untrusting buyers and sellers to engage in commerce. His fourth trust architecture is distributed trust. This is emergent trust in the particular security system that is blockchain.</p><p>What blockchain does is <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/04/who-controls-the-blockchain&quot;}" href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/who-controls-the-blockchain" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shift some of the trust</a> in people and institutions to trust in technology. You need to trust the cryptography, the protocols, the software, the computers and the network. And you need to trust them absolutely, because they’re often single points of failure.</p><p>When that trust turns out to be misplaced, there is no recourse. If your bitcoin exchange <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/">gets hacked</a>, you lose all of your money. If your bitcoin wallet <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.ccn.com/breaking-numerous-bitcoin-wallets-may-have-been-compromised-by-rogue-developer&quot;}" href="https://www.ccn.com/breaking-numerous-bitcoin-wallets-may-have-been-compromised-by-rogue-developer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gets hacked</a>, you lose all of your money. If you forget your login credentials, you lose all of your money. If there’s a <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://medium.com/new-alchemy/a-short-history-of-smart-contract-hacks-on-ethereum-1a30020b5fd&quot;}" href="https://medium.com/new-alchemy/a-short-history-of-smart-contract-hacks-on-ethereum-1a30020b5fd" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bug in the code</a> of your smart contract, you lose all of your money. If someone successfully <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://boingboing.net/2019/01/08/ethereum-classic-blockchain-su.html&quot;}" href="https://boingboing.net/2019/01/08/ethereum-classic-blockchain-su.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hacks the blockchain security</a>, you lose all of your money. In many ways, trusting technology is harder than trusting people. Would you rather trust a human legal system or the details of some computer code you don’t have the expertise to audit?</p></div></div></div></div>
