You use a functional effect system such as Cats IO, Monix or ZIO. Now your program is a value and does not actually do anything unless you unsafeRun it at the end of the world. At that point in time all side effects and concurrency will manifest. How does that actually work?</p><p>During this workshop, we will build a minimal effect runtime similar to the one used in ZIO and interpreting the ZIO API. We will learn how effects can get executed and how parallelism and concurrency can be implemented using fibers aka green threads.</p><p>We will start from a very simple runtime, which does not implement any concurrency or advanced features and just provides a trampoline for stack safe execution of effects. From there, we will add more primitives until we can support concurrency including forking and joining, cooperative and preemptive scheduling, interruption, and modeling of, and recovering from errors.</p><p>The focus will be on explaining, how the individual primitives can be built and composed into a runtime. We will not focus on performance or feature completeness. </p><p>Basics of functional effect systems will be explained briefly, but this workshop is not meant as an introduction to IO monads / bifunctors. Some basic prior knowledge will be helpful for following the workshop.</p><p>The presenter had the idea for this workshop while fixing a bug in the ZIO runtime and realizing that it actually is quite easy to understand once you peel away a few advanced features and some low level optimizations. </p></div></div></div></div>
