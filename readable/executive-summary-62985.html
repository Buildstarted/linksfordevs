          <p>“Secondary Infektion” is the name given to a long-running Russian information operation, encompassing multiple campaigns on social media run by a central entity, which was already active in 2014 and that was still running in early 2020.</p>
          <p>Secondary Infektion targeted countries across Europe and North America with fake stories and forged documents. Its focus and areas of interest were often of a diplomatic and foreign policy nature: it appeared primarily aimed at provoking tensions between Russia’s perceived enemies, and its stories typically concerned relationships between governments and often specifically focused on government representatives. It is also notable for launching smear campaigns against Kremlin critics, and for targeting presidential candidates in 2016 in the U.S., in 2017 in France, in Germany, Sweden and elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Little is yet known about the central entity behind the operation: its identity is the single most pressing question to emerge from this study.<sup data-toggle="popover" data-title="Reference<span class=&quot;close&quot;>&amp;times;</span>" data-html="true" data-container="body" data-content="<a href=&quot;#ftnt_ref1&quot; id=&quot;ftnt1&quot;>[1]</a>&amp;nbsp;As the identity of the operator is
    currently unknown, it is commonly referred to by the nickname of the operation itself. “Secondary
    Infektion” is named after the Soviet-era “Operation Infektion,” which planted the false story
    that the United States had made the AIDS virus in many publications around the world. See David Robert Grimes,
    “Russian fake news is not new: Soviet Aids propaganda cost countless lives,” The Guardian, June 14,
    2017, <a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/jun/14/russian-fake-news-is-not-new-soviet-aids-propaganda-cost-countless-lives&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1591208193532000&quot;>https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/jun/14/russian-fake-news-is-not-new-soviet-aids-propaganda-cost-countless-lives</a>.
  " data-original-title="" title="">[1]</sup>&nbsp;The Facebook security team uncovered a small cluster of accounts run by the operation for the first time in May 2019 and provided the original attribution to actors based in Russia. This in turn enabled others to identify related clusters and stories linked to Secondary Infektion in late 2019 and early 2020. From November 2019 to May 2020, the Graphika team uncovered over 2,500 pieces of content that Secondary Infektion posted across six years, seven languages, and more than 300 platforms and web forums, from social media giants such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit to niche discussion forums in Pakistan and Australia, providing an unprecedented view of the operation’s breadth and depth.</p>
          <p>This report is the first systematic examination of Secondary Infektion’s campaigns. It reveals the most comprehensive picture yet of this actor’s strategic objectives and tactical priorities across the years.</p>
          <p>The scale of the operation is impressive, but the range of topics it focused on was relatively small. In descending order of frequency, the operation posted about nine main themes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ukraine as a failed state or unreliable partner</li>
            <li>The United States and NATO as aggressive and interfering in other countries</li>
            <li>Europe as weak and divided</li>
            <li>Critics of the Russian government as morally corrupt, alcoholic, or otherwise mentally unstable</li>
            <li>Muslims as aggressive invaders</li>
            <li>The Russian government as the victim of Western hypocrisy or plots</li>
            <li>Western elections as rigged and candidates who criticized the Kremlin as unelectable</li>
            <li>Turkey as an aggressive and destabilizing state</li>
            <li>World sporting bodies and competitions as unfair, unprofessional, and Russophobic</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While active on Reddit, Medium, Twitter, Quora, Facebook, and YouTube, Secondary Infektion used blogging forums more extensively than it used the main social media platforms. It typically worked by posting false and politically explosive stories - often based on images of “leaked” documents - on internet forums and then amplified them in various languages across a range of platforms. The “leaks” typically exposed some dramatic geopolitical scandal, such as a prominent Kremlin critic’s corrupt dealings or secret American plans to overthrow pro-Kremlin governments around the world. &nbsp;On most occasions, the operation created a new account to post each version of the story and abandoned each account as soon as it had posted. We found no evidence of Secondary Infektion using ads to amplify these stories.</p>
          <p>The earliest traces of Secondary Infektion activity online point to campaigns targeting the Russian opposition in early 2014. When Russia annexed Crimea in February-March 2014, Secondary Infektion shifted to attacking Ukraine, first in Russian and then in English and German as well. With time, it added more targets and more languages, reaching its peak production in late 2018 and early 2019.

          <p>Almost none of those efforts achieved measurable impact. Particularly between late 2016 and early 2020, Secondary Infektion relied on high OPSEC single-use burner accounts for almost everything it posted (it typically created, used and abandoned each account in less than an hour). This meant that the operators never had the chance to build an audience: each time they created a new account, they effectively reset their following to zero. It would be hard to envisage a less viral strategy. In all its years, only one Secondary Infektion effort really achieved traction in the mainstream discussion of targeted countries: the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://graphika.com/reports/UK-trade-leaks/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591208193176000">leak</a>&nbsp;of apparently genuine US-UK trade documents on the eve of Britain’s general election in 2019, as exposed by our team in November 2019.<sup data-toggle="popover" data-title="Reference<span class=&quot;close&quot;>&amp;times;</span>" data-html="true" data-container="body" data-content="<a href=&quot;#ftnt_ref18&quot; id=&quot;ftnt18&quot;>[18]</a>See Ben Nimmo, “UK Trade

  " data-original-title="" title="">[18]</sup>&nbsp;Another enduring mystery around the operation is what the operators thought they were doing and why they kept on doing it across six years of activity when their stories so often died unnoticed. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
          <h2 id="unique-features">Unique Features</h2>
          <p>Secondary Infektion is unique for the sheer range of platforms on which it posted: no other operation from any country that Graphika has studied even comes close. This operational feature could have been a security measure, as it reduced the impact that any one platform could have on the operation and simultaneously rendered coordinated enforcement and investigations harder.</p>
          <p>The operation’s lack of viral engagement also sets it apart. Almost none of the operation’s posts across six years of activity achieved any measurable engagement, in terms of shares, likes and positive reactions across platforms. This may indicate that the operators were not interested in engagement metrics - for example, if they were driven by production quotas rather than engagement targets - or that they were using some other form of metrics not visible to outside observers. The lasting mismatch between effort expended and apparent impact gained is yet another mystery about this operation.</p>
          <p>Secondary Infektion is also remarkable for its high operational security (OPSEC): multiple social media platforms who partnered with our team on this investigation have observed that the people behind this operation were sophisticated at hiding their traces consistently across the years. As of May 2020, this operation has not been directly attributed to a particular actor or entity. A number of converging signals, from digital forensics indicators identified by our team or provided by the platforms to the clues of language, content, and context, help establish that the operation was run from Russia, but which organization(s) and individual(s) within Russia are responsible is still unknown.</p>
          <p>The high OPSEC also made it difficult to expose the full scope of the operation. Secondary Infektion deployed single-use burner accounts so consistently that moving from one campaign, forgery, and story to the next proved difficult, because most accounts only posted one article each. Reconstituting the broader picture of the operation presented a significant and time-consuming investigative challenge. This report is the first large-scale analysis of Secondary Infektion to look beyond anecdotal descriptions of individual stories and identify its systematic patterns. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, our report remains a snapshot and its limitations must be considered: alongside additional stories by the operation that may remain to be discovered, it is highly likely that a significant chunk of the operation’s archives and traces have been lost to various types of content-moderation and behavior-based enforcement efforts across the years. Secondary Infektion’s posts were consistently low-quality, often running afoul of anti-spam rules on platforms and at times generating pushback from other users who came across their content. It is likely that we will never identify all the articles that Secondary Infektion posted. Our hope is that the current report will provide a springboard for more researchers to make more discoveries and bring the full puzzle closer to completion.</p>

    used the same accounts repeatedly between mid-2014 and mid-2016. These accounts shared a significant proportion
    of non-original content and reposted individual Secondary Infektion stories repeatedly, occasionally dozens of
