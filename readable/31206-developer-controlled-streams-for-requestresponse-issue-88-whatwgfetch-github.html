For H2, you'd cancel the stream.</p></blockquote><p>In some cases you can optimise this logic to avoid closing the connection, but this is roughly what <code>async-http</code> ended up doing.</p><blockquote><p>most will 411 (Length Required) if there's no Content-Length</p></blockquote><p><code>async-http</code> and by composition, <code>falcon</code> (web server) both accept chunked request body. In addition, <code>falcon</code> accepts non-content-length bodies, but you must use TCP's <code>shutdown(WR)</code> functionality in order to signal the end of the body. With these bits in place, it's possible to have quite decent HTTP/1 bi-directional streaming, even for (a slightly extended at the TCP layer) HTTP/1.0!</p><p>I also implemented support for WebSockets, and it's such an orthogonal concept, especially in the design of the server, that I really believe and hope that we can build something better directly on top of HTTP/2. WebSockets seems like a step in the wrong direction.</p></div></div></div></div>
