Mac (Steve Lemme), Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar), Foster (Paul Stoter), and Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske) are four Vermont state troopers whose dedication to duty is not exactly an inspiration to law enforcement officers everywhere. Stationed in a small town near the Canadian border, the troopers don&#x27;t have much to do, so they while away their hours smoking dope and harassing hapless motorists. Their superior officer, Capt. O&#x27;Hagan (Brian Cox), likes the boys and they try to keep their more outrageous antics out of his earshot, but they often run afoul of fellow trooper Farva (Kevin Heffernan), who insists on doing things by the book. When Governor Jessman (Lynda Carter) announces massive budget cuts for Vermont law enforcement personnel, things look bad for the troopers and they must quickly prove their worth or they&#x27;ll be forced to look for real jobs. Appropriately enough, the troopers stumble upon some information regarding a group of marijuana dealers operating along the border; the guys figure this is just the sort of high-profile bust that could save their careers, but the police department of a nearby town gets wind of the troopers&#x27; plans. The Earlville police are no friends of the troopers, and they set out to ruin their moment of glory. Super Troopers was written by the five-man comedy troupe Broken Lizard, who also star as the five troopers; the group&#x27;s leader, Jay Chandrasekhar, directed.&#xA;&#xA;CREDITS:&#xA;TM &amp; &#xA9; Fox (2001)&#xA;Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation&#xA;Cast: Jim Gaffigan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter&#xA;Director: Jay Chandrasekhar&#xA;Producers: Robert Barocci, Amy Minda Cohen, Annie Flocco, Peter E.
