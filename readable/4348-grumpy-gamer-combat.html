    WASD vs Arrow keys is like asking "Left handed butter knife or Right handed butter knife?" The knife can be used in either hand, but some people will complain about the fine details being on the wrong side.</p><p>For any game that has a 2D perspective, the Arrow keys are the most obvious choice to use, and use ZXC for commands. For games that have a 3D perspective, WASD is the most obvious choice, and WASD requires the mouse to "camera/aim/fire"</p><p>In MMORPG's that use WASD, usally all the commands are activated using the number key row, and the 4 keys directly above the WASD are used for commands that you would stop moving to use (eg block/parry/cast) while the right-hand has to be the actual fire button, and that would have to be the space-bar if not used for jumping. </p><p>Alternatively, you can also do WASD + number pad, as laptops without a full number pad will remap those keys to the right hand side of the keyboard, OR, you can use DEL/END/PGDN (which also map to the number pad)</p><p>Though if you want to hit everything the best option is simply to let players change the key bindings, or put it in as a kind of quiz at the beginning. "Which key moves you forward" "Which key do you fire with"&nbsp;&nbsp;and go from there.<br></p></div></div></div></div>
