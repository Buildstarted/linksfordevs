<h3 dir="ltr" id="we-customer-review-339926">  30 second ads for 15 second long videos
</h3>

  <blockquote id="ember103645486">      

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi="">I use Daily Mail as one of my news sources on an almost everyday basis. They do a great job of covering world events and all the latest stories. The only negative thing, and it’s becoming a huge pain, is having to sit through advertisements that are longer than the actual clips I am trying to watch. 30 second ad for a 15 second video? Really?? This is increasingly becoming more of an issue.  I don’t use a lot of apps, but this is the only one I use that the ads are consistently disproportionate to the actual clips I am trying watch. I don’t even watch the videos when I see a ridiculously long ad at the beginning. Hopefully Daily Mail can figure out a better way of hitting their advertisement goals and also providing news without forcing us all to watch ridiculous amounts of ads.</p>

      <div dir="false" data-test-bidi=""><p>So, I had never even seen the daily mail prior to downloading the app. I downloaded all the news apps I could find. I wanted to see what had interesting content as well as informative. Daily mail is now my go to news site because they have the political news mixed with the salacious news stories you cannot find anywhere else. All the stories are highly, highly detailed and comprehensive often with videos and always with probably more pictures than you need, although I appreciate them as they help to put you inside the story.</p><p>This might be my second online review. I wish I didn’t like the daily mail and it was the Wall Street journal I liked better so I sound more sophisticated, but not so... anyway. Just go to the website, check out both the UK and Us sections... oh and us citizens, vote in Nov (regardless of your political leaning go vote).</p></div>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi="">I used to love this app, I opened it first thing in the morning and again in the evening when it would update. What is going on with these pop up videos though? They make it impossible to read an article as three will pop up at a time and when you exit out they just pop up again. I mean you CANNOT read anything in here anymore the app seriously doesn’t work. It is so frustrating. They pop up whether you watch the whole thing or click out immediately. It’s become completely unusable. Before all that happened though I loved daily mail. The grammar and actual content is pretty bad, but they break stories before anyone else and have pictures most others can’t seem to get. I barely read the articles, because they’ll post the same one literally verbatim everyday. However if you just skim through the title and bullet points and a few pictures you’ll get the jist of what’s going on. If they could fix whatever is going on with their ads I would give a better rating but this bug is ridiculous.</p>
