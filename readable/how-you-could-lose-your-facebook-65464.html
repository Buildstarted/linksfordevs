I was starting to get worried but I thought it has to be a hack, someone is hacking in to my account,” he said after noticing his profile had also been changed to the ISIS flag.</p><p>His Facebook account and his linked Instagram account then disappeared after the hackers violated the social media platform’s community standards.</p><p>Similar to Ms Baird’s case, the hackers soon turned their attention to the aviation business where Mr Barden worked, using his compromised account to delete all the other administrators before purchasing a few hundred dollars worth of Facebook ads for an Asian clothing company.</p><p><b>RELATED: <a data-tgev="event119" data-tgev-metric="ev" data-tgev-order="778c86c9ba9d27c62182303941547572" data-tgev-label="technology" data-tgev-container="bodylink"

client in a similar boat.</p><p>“Someone has hacked their personal Facebook and uploaded the ISIS flag to their profile photo and background, which has then triggered Facebook to deactivate the account,” he said.</p><p>“That seems to be the M.O. of the hackers, I have no idea what the ultimate goal is but the consequences are really real.”</p><p>In response to Ms Baird’s situation, Australia’s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said it was indicative of another disturbing social media trend.</p><p>“While online abuse, hatred and humiliation can be directed at anybody,

title="www.news.com.au">Grieving boyfriend branded ‘scum’</a></b></p><p>Ms Grant told news.com.au “large companies such as Facebook” have been receptive in principle to the concept of “safety by design”.</p><p>“eSafety consistently takes the position that user safety should be a key feature of the design and development of online services and platforms, not an add-on after disaster strikes.”</p><p>She said she welcomed the receptiveness but “unfortunately, this does not always prevent human malfeasance or totally minimise all online risks”.</p><p>In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said the company was “committed to safeguarding the integrity of our services and take action on any attempt to gain unauthorised access to user accounts”.</p><p>“We’re working to secure this account, and we encourage people to strengthen their security by turning on app-based two-factor authentication and alerts for unrecognised logins,” a Facebook company spokesperson said.</p><p>Mr Stewart said Facebook needed to work harder and had the means to do so.</p><p>“We know <a data-tgev="event119" data-tgev-metric="ev" data-tgev-order="e96d56807727c4bc668670beca6d8cda"
