<p>Recently, there has been discussion regarding the recording technology used in some of our WD Red hard disk drives (HDDs). We regret any misunderstanding and want to take a few minutes to discuss the drives and provide some additional information.</p>



<p>WD Red HDDs are ideal for home and small businesses using NAS systems. They are great for sharing and backing up files using one to eight drive bays and for a workload rate of 180 TB a year. We’ve rigorously tested this type of use and have been validated by the major NAS providers.</p>



<p>We typically specify the designed-for use cases and performance parameters and don’t always talk about what’s under the hood. One of those innovations is Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology.</p>



<p>SMR is tested and proven technology that enables us to keep up with the growing volume of data for personal and business use. We are continuously innovating to advance it. SMR technology is implemented in different ways – drive-managed SMR (DMSMR), on the device itself, as in the case of our lower capacity (2TB – 6TB) WD Red HDDs, and host-managed SMR, which is used in high-capacity data center applications. Each implementation serves a different use case, ranging from personal computing to some of the largest data centers in the world.</p>



<p>DMSMR is designed to manage intelligent data placement within the drive, rather than relying on the host, thus enabling a seamless integration for end users. The data intensity of typical small business/home NAS workloads is intermittent, leaving sufficient idle time for DMSMR drives to perform background data management tasks as needed and continue an optimal performance experience for users.</p>



<p>WD Red HDDs have for many years reliably powered home and small business NAS systems around the world and have been consistently validated by major NAS manufacturers. Having built this reputation, we understand that, at times, our drives may be used in system workloads far exceeding their intended uses. Additionally, some of you have recently shared that in certain, more data intensive, continuous read/write use cases, the WD Red HDD-powered NAS systems are not performing as you would expect.</p>



<p>If you are encountering performance that is not what you expected, please consider our products designed for intensive workloads. These may include our <a href="https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/wd-red-pro-sata-hdd#WD2002FFSX" target="_blank">WD Red Pro</a> or <a href="https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/wd-gold-sata-hdd#WD1005FBYZ" target="_blank">WD Gold</a> drives, or perhaps an Ultrastar drive. Our customer care team is ready to help and can also determine which product might be best for you.</p>



<p>We know you entrust your data to our products, and we don’t take that lightly. If you have purchased a WD Red drive, <a href="https://support-en.wd.com/app/Contact_Us" target="_blank">please call our customer care</a> if you are experiencing performance or any other technical issues. We will have options for you. We are here to help.</p>
