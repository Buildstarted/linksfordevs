</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.45 - Nov 19, 2019</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] Play voice actions with invalid/missing priority classes now auto-pass text filters in the Assets tab, so you
can find them by doing e.g. "@priority=missing"
</li><li> [Studio] Designers can now adjust the platform deployment for a source on an event that uses the source.
</li><li> [Studio] Convolution Reverb IRs can be overridden on a per IR, per platform basis by creating a subfolder under ImpulseReponses
that matches the name of the target platform.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where per-action user preferences would be applied to all actions in an event.
</li><li> [Studio] Voice priority classes and priority groups can be overridden per platform.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where priority ranges could be zero, resulting in random eviction order.
</li><li> [Studio] Sources can override their WAV file on a per platform basis.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a but where the graph at the top of the Client Debugger could show the wrong number of events.
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.44 - Nov 7, 2019</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio/Runtime] Added State Switching. Group states in to a Switcher with an attached controller to cause Miles to
automatically migrate between those states using a default transition, optionally overriding the transition. Switches
can also "hold" the first state chosen when the voice is created.
</li><li> [Studio] Specifying --console on the command line in Miles Studio will show the debug Windows console.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for newer Perforce clients not properly handling adding files.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with cycle detection on buses preventing drag/drop attachement.
</li><li> [Studio] Multiple event property windows can now be opened, and the properties for the active selection can be "Popped Out".
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with opening a null device on a system with no audio adapters.
</li><li> [Studio] Memory usage improvements related to languages (only the selected language is kept in memory)
</li><li> [Studio] Memory usage improvements related to large compress caches.
</li><li> [Studio] Adding a language no longer causes every Source to need to be saved to disc with changes.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a hitch when recompressing sources.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a project render flag to command line builds to allow only rendering the base language, as opposed
to all languages.
</li><li> [Studio] Recompressing all wav files is faster.
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.43 - Oct 4, 2019</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] Improved the Performance tab in the client debugger.
</li><li> [Studio] Client Debugger piano now auto scrolls with the full view being utilized instead of half.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug when reordering priority classes.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with undoing changes that affect snapshot groups.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a new platform
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with distance scaling ducks.
</li><li> [Studio] Volume curves can be copy/pasted in the Assets Tab now.
</li><li> [Runtime] MilesEventGetDetails no longer crashes if you pass 0 for the name.
</li><li> [Runtime] MilesEventInfoQueueEnum no longer crashes if the info queue was never enabled.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a crash that would occur when copy pasting run events that create self-references.
</li><li> [Studio] Improved classic/state view switching and handling.
</li><li> [Studio] Random Ranges can be set in the Assets Tab now.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where double clicking in some cases could create spurious drags.
</li><li> [Studio] Previewing events in Miles Studio runs validation checks more consistently, protecting against some crashes.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a basic copy/paste to state layers.
</li><li> [Studio] The priority classes view can be resized now.
</li><li> [Studio] Undo no longer resets the properties scroll position.
</li><li> [Studio/Runtime] Added "Named Streams", allowing external audio sources (voice chat, synthesizers)
to be referenced as Sources from within Miles Studio. To use, create a top level folder "NamedStreams"
in the Sources list and create a source as normal under that folder, then reference it in an event.
The example "hl_named_streams" demostrates how to pass that audio to the Miles runtime.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a flag to output the list of events that were excluded from project rendering,
and why (--trimmed-event-log-file).
</li><li> [Studio] Added several Miles Studio performance counters to try and track down some issues. (Help-&gt;View Performance)
</li><li> [Studio] Some project load optimizations
</li><li> [Studio] Sources that are considered "temporary" for any reason are rendered in grey. Hovering over the Source in the Sources
list will show a tooltip saying the reason.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a crash when opening the client debugger without a project loaded.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a crash when a repeating state has a delay and ends at the exact same time as it is muted.
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.42 - August 30, 2019</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] Duplicate priority class now copies all fields.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed several issues with sleeping events
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.41 - August 27, 2019</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where the event csv remapper would crash if the target event existed in a folder other than the one being operated on.
</li><li> [Studio] Dramatic optimization of moving or renaming assets.
</li><li> [Studio] More Perforce operations are batched - dramatic speedup on some operations.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a couple bugs with moving layers up or down in play voice actions.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with cancelling the "add controller" dialog in the preview window
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.40 - August 20, 2019</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where priorty class names could end up white on white.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where priority class controllers couldn't be assigned.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where the assets tab would crash when sources were recompressed.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where trying to sync the graph view to the graph data in a graph template would crash.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where syncing a project change while a voice was sleeping during auditioning could sometimes crash.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where editing a priority class without another project-wide change wouldn't get sent with "Sync Clients".
</li><li> [Unreal] Exiting Play-in-editor now kills all running voices.
</li><li> [Unreal] Added basic auditioning support.
</li><li> [Studio] In the client debugger, the events view and the priority view now incorporate event coloring.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where maximizing Miles Studio by double clicking the title bar with the priority tab open would change the selection.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where "Edit"ing a Play Voice action in the assets tab wouldn't properly sync the Bank tab events list selection if
"Hide Actions" had been set.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added Priority Class Group Limits, which allow Priority Classes to be assigned to groups, each with a voice limit. Voices
in the priority classes of a priority class group all count towards that limit, providing multiple tiers of voice limiting withing
the priority class system.
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.39 - August 11, 2019</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] Client Debugger now has a 3d view in addition to the 2d view of events.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where large numbers of errors/warnings would prevent the dialog box from showing up when rendering projects.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a color property to Events. This color isn't used everywhere yet - in the voices and 2d/3d view in the
client debugger. Can be edited in the Assets view, as well as Event Properties.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where voices could sometimes pick the wrong bus for output and not tell you about it. Sometimes this would
result in a crash.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where mute trigger levels would cause affected voices to always fade in.
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.38 - July 22, 2019</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Runtime] Fixed a minor bug where random layer volumes would get generated twice.
</li><li> [Studio] Controllers can now specify a graph template that will automatically get set
as the transform when the controller is assigned.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a warning when synced voices have incompatible source selector layouts (i.e.
wouldn't not stay in sync)
</li><li> [Studio] Added a sync button to sync the view to the actual graph width when editing transforms.
</li><li> [Runtime] Lots of Switch optimizations.
</li><li> [Studio] A variety of UI improvements in the client debugger. Stop and Named signals are shown on the
voice timeline, with more visibility in to voices that weren't audible for some reason (data mute or
starvation).
</li><li> [Studio] Miles Studio will now properly warn when an asset is created that would cause a duplicate name
when Flatten Event Names is set. If such names exist on load, then there's a fallback resolution path
for renaming to get rid of those errors.
</li><li> [Runtime] Priority Classes can now blend two adjustment types. This is generally used to combine age with
distance, to avoid some annoying degenerate cases when you just use one or the other with things like footsteps.
</li><li> [Studio] Active voices when auditioning or previewing will show their priority as they play on the priority classes
tab with a little dot, for help with visualizing.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added an experimental priority proximity suppression system. This system lowers the priority of other
voices in the same priority class that are in the same direction. This is to try and manage situations where
voices that are in two groups, each in a distinct direction (i.e. one left one right), don't have one group
dominate the voice counts because all of the voices are slightly closer than all of the voices in the other group.
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.37 - June 15, 2019</b></span></h2><ul><li> BREAKING CHANGE - The voice selection/priority system has been migrated from buses
to Priority Classes. The upgrade system should minimize any changes. In addition,
Distance Sleeping Events have been updated to be per-voice, and so are now Distance
Sleeping Voices. The person integrating the update should save the project before
checking in the upgrade, as a new file will be created, and that should exist on
disc before multiple users start using the new version.
</li><li> [Runtime] IMPORTANT BUGFIX - Specifying the channels on a bus never worked! In the
assets view, verify that any bus not set to "Default" channels are buses you expect.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with BPM detection in WAV file names.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with viewing Source properties with very short WAV files.
</li><li> [Studio] The assets tab no longer searches automatically when the timer expires.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a driver parameter to cap the maximum level output to the hardware.
Some audio devices handle full utilization of the output range poorly. This defaults
to 32600 / 32767
</li><li> Lots of Client Debugger improvements. Most notably is the introduction of the Priority
view, which shows a moment-in-time view of voices.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with completion transitions on infinite layers.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug for extremely long running events with thousands of layers crashing.
</li><li> [Runtime] Muting and unmuting a voice now fades over ~300 ms.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with using shift to expand selections in the events list.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a new API for specifying the priority class for an event to be
used by all voices it starts. The old Priority Adjust api has been removed.
</li><li> [Studio] Events previewed in Miles Studio are now visible in the Client Debugger.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a crash with editing clean options as a result of a corruption.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with dragging sources where the selection cross folder boundaries.
</li><li> [Runtime/Studio] Solo/mute now works for nested events (i.e. run events and loop segment events)
</li><li> [Studio] In the Assets tab, ctrl-c now can copy the asset name to the clipboard.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a new API for prefetching an event - all sources for the event will have
very low priority prefetch queued.
</li><li> [Runtime] Inactive (muted) voices now have lower IO priority.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added congestion control to random selectors. When IO is determined to be under
load, random nodes will drop randomization in favor or re-using sources that
are in memory.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for edit boxes in other windows not working when the assets tab is open.
</li><li> [Runtime] Retain is now in seconds, and has an option to be infinite.
</li><li> [Runtime] The I/O latency simulation has been pushed to a lower (more accurate) level.
</li><li> [Runtime] I/O has been updated to a page prefetching model to support new IO features
</li><li> [Studio] Voice Layers can now be "cloned" when editing.
</li><li> [Studio] In the Assets tab, names can be searched using basic wildcards (* and ?).
</li><li> [Runtime] Various runtime performance improvements, especially with muted voices.
</li><li> [Studio] In the Assets tab, string properties no longer pass filter checks when empty.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a crash with Run Event Actions and deleted events.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fix for xaudio occasionally locking when transitioning to the null device.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where dragging sources in a certain way could corrupt a source selector.
</li><li> [General] Miles documentation has been updated from CHM to a single searchable HTML file.
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.36 - Mar 17, 2019</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with controller selectors.
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.35 - Mar 15, 2019</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] BREAKING CHANGE - Mute/pause has been removed in favor of Distance Sleeping Events. Buses
that had a mute/pause level specified now are only mute.
</li><li> [Studio] BREAKING CHANGE - 3D graphs must now be bound to AutoDistance, and can no longer be arbitrarily assigned to
controllers. Any such graphs will be updated to AutoDistance.
</li><li> [Studio] Miles Studio no longer requires deprecated sources to be present on disc for renders.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a flag for marking events as temporary. These events respond to the temp render flags
the same way as sources.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where events wouldn't get properly deprecated if they had a source that was
deprecated.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added "Distance Sleeping Events". Events can be flagged to automatically go to sleep when
their distance to the listener exceeds the radius specified for the event under Event Defaults. Events
will go to sleep at 120% of that distance, and wake back up at 110% of that distance.
</li><li> [Studio] Dramatically sped up rendering large projects with a manifest specified.
</li><li> [Studio] Random weights for source selection can now be set directly, and are explicitly shown
(as opposed to just the resulting % chance).
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.34 - Feb 15, 2019</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] Fix for compress cache corruption in projects with more than 512k wav files.
</li><li> [Studio] Client Debugger now shows the correct initial priority for voices.
</li><li> [Runtime] MilesEventGetDetails now no longer tries to adjust the expected event length
with the event pitch, as there are many other pitches, and it's usually random anyway.
</li><li> [Runtime] Planar spatialization now handles 4 channel devices properly, and also now correctly
falls back to vector spatialization on unhandled formats.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where bus channel counts were displayed incorrectly in the assets tab.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with previewing planar spatialization inside Miles Studio.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with END transition timing and random loop segments.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with non-infinite loop counts and random loop segments.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a way to extract single events and dependencies in to a designated folder on disc,
including wav files.
</li><li> [Studio] Added --no-compress-cache to force a rebuild of the compress cache when building projects
from the command line.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for language indices being off by one.
</li><li> [Runtime] Mute/pause voice performance improved.
</li><li> [Runtime] SIMD mixer sped up, and fixed a minor bug with volume change ramping.
</li><li> [Runtime] Bus mix sort optimized.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug where hard coded bus priority offsets were ignored.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug when none of the random loop segments are in memory.
</li><li> [Runtime] Minimum Interval restrictions are now respected for Evict Last voices.
</li><li> [Studio] Deprecated events are now ignored in Run Events.
</li><li> [Studio] Signal names are now restricted to alpha numeric.
</li><li> [Runtime] Layer gain dynamics are now evaluated when voices are inactive.
</li><li> [Studio] Radius computation for events now looks for a place on graphs that is above the cutoff dB, before trying
to find where it falls below. Fixes radius computation for middle and far field voices.
</li><li> [Runtime] Layer gain is now included for mute and priority calculations.
</li><li> [Runtime] Loop segment events stop firing once a voice receives the stop signal and is fading out.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug in the client debugger with the # of active voices being displayed.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed some bugs with displaying the computed event radius.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a way to reset a "held" controller, in cases where the game code
predictively passes a value, expecting to be able to correct it later.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a flag to control whether all layers must complete before
the completion transition will fire, or just the primary.
</li><li> [Studio] Perforce edits with huge numbers of files are way faster now.
</li><li> [Runtime] The first loop segment event now fires when the voice begins, instead of when its created.
</li><li> [Runtime] Prototype planar spatialization now blends offplane vectors to all speakers.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for deprecating temp sources.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for nested event - source - event deprecation. Meaning, if a source deprecates an event, then all of the sources
in that event also get deprecated.
</li><li> [Studio] Leaving perforce information empty will attempt to use environment variables for login/port.
</li><li> [Runtime] Random start markers tries to avoid markers that aren't in memory yet.
</li><li> [Runtime] Random Loop Segment Events are now only fired by the primary layer. This includes the exit cue event.
</li><li> [Runtime] Bink Audio bit decoder has been optimized (some more)
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with projects being rendered multiple times with Deprecated events.
</li><li> [Runtime] All layers in a state jump to the exit cue, when that flag is set (instead of just the primary layer)
</li><li> [Studio] Readahead byte amount for sources now exposed in Miles Studio.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with hardcoded FX chain constants.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with random selector state.
</li><li> [Studio] Previewing events in Miles Studio can now be recorded to a WAV file.
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.33 - Oct 18, 2018</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] MilesEventGetDetails now reports if the event needs continual orientation updates, or only
once.
</li><li> [Runtime] Random List selectors now avoid the last entry used when reshuffling the list.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed an issue with WASAPI outputs where switched between devices with different sample rates
could crash or lock.
</li><li> [Studio] Most sources of property randomization have been migrated to the "Random Range" style, in order
to support randomizer synchronization.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed an issue with clearing a filter chain template from the assets view.
</li><li> [Studio] Randomizers are now indexed, allowing for generated values to be locked for a desired amount of time. The
default randomizer acts as before, always generating a new value. Others default to locking the value for the lifetime
of the event.
</li><li> [Studio] Support for loading Really Old Projects has been removed - this shouldn't affect anyone. If it does, use 10.0.32
and save to latest.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a way for Miles Studio to provide the same preloads to auditioning clients as a normal render would. This is
disabled by default to prevent Miles Studio from having to access the disc when clients connect - expect longer "hitches"
when games connect to Miles Studio when this is enabled. This is controlled by Main Menu -&gt; Audition -&gt; Fast Game Connect. When
enabled, Miles will not access the disc when games connect, but will not be a true representation of the preload.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed several crashes associated with a consistency failure due to snapshots somehow not getting saved when a filter
on a bus is removed.
</li><li> [Studio] Planar Spatialization can now be specified when running replays via Tools -&gt; Run Replay.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with pausing events.
</li><li> [Runtime] Planar Spatialization now rotates the listener basis before projecting, to prevent sounds below you when
looking down sounding behind.
</li><li> [Runtime/Studio] Event Radius is now computed on build, rather than on demand via EventGetDetails. The default dB cutoff
is specified in Project Settings (-40 dB), the cutoff can be manually overridden on a per event basis. In addition, the
radius can be manually specified on a per event basis.
</li><li> [Runtime] EventGetDetails now includes radius and controller information from Run Event actions.
</li><li> [Studio] Sources can now be marked temporary explicitly, instead of only via temp/final directories.
</li><li> [Runtime] Random Loop Markers Segments can now run an event when a marker is first jumped to.
</li><li> [Studio/Runtime] Added "Named Signal Transitions". Transitions between states can now signaled by a string queued via
MilesQueueEventSignal, instead of just when a controller becomes positive. Such transitions only fire once, preventing the
need for complicated selection graphs on controllers and mappings of indeces to states.
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.32 - Sept 3, 2018</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Auditioning] Changing project settings and doing a "Sync Client" now saves the running events and destroys
them, reloading them afterwards instead of trying to keep voices running across the recreation. This should
fix several spurious crashes, however random volumes and pitches will be reselected for active voices. Please
report any major anomalies!
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for marker tool tips.
</li><li> [Studio] Controllers with "Hold First Value" can now be previewed in Miles Studio in a useful way.
</li><li> [Runtime] States can now reevaluated the manual position for an event on entry. This allows repeat actions
to change their event's position each time they repeat.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where Sources couldn't be moved to another folder as a group.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added the ability for a transition timed to end on a loop boundary to jump to the exit cue afterwards.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added randomized marker segments to source playback. To enable, specify a loop start marker for
a voice state. Once specified, a checkbox below will cause Miles to use the loop start marker as a set
of markers to randomly play, avoiding repeats. Each segment plays until the following marker, whether
or not it matches the loop start marker specification.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where draging a bus send to itself causes a stack overflow crash.
</li><li> [Runtime] Using a marker for a start position, loop start position, or loop end position now matches
any marker that /starts with/ the given string, instead of requiring an exact match. If multiple matches
exist, one is randomly selected. Repeats are allowed.
</li><li> [Runtime] Several fixes for state transition, including allowing multiple layers in states other than the initial state.
</li><li> [Runtime] MilesEventGetDetails has been updated to provide controller names as well as enough information to
know what event setup queue functions are needed for a given event (e.g. position, orientation).
</li><li> [Studio] Function controllers now have a min and max value, and correctly respond to out-of-bounds
like Game controllers. As a result, they also now have a slider when setting their value in Preview Controls.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a helper dialog to compute the BPM for a file given a number of beats in the file.
</li><li> [Runtime] Beats / Minute can now go up to 64000.
</li><li> [Runtime] BREAKING CHANGE DEPENDING ON PROJECT - Bus fader values now interpolate the final value ONLY instead of each
independent snapshot. This fixes a subtle bug where if a bus fader had multiple snapshot groups targeting
it, accumulation would be incorrect and double count the base bus value. Fixing this breaks current mixing
levels, but the value used will now be the expected value.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug when closing Miles Studio with a game still connected.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added "stingers" to transitions. Transitions can now start a source when they are fired,
in addition to the transition source that starts on the transition timing.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added the ability to "Sleep" events, which removes them from active processing. Major state
is saved, but transitionary state is not.
</li><li> [Runtime] Improved performance for temp asset deprecation during builds.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for highlighting playing sources in events with Run actions.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a pop on voices with multiple layers.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed crash in Graph Templates
</li><li> [Runtime] Misc performance fixes
</li><li> [Studio] Adding performance measures to Miles Studio.
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.31 - Jun 25, 2018</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where changing a deprecated event would allow it to get sent to the client when syncing during auditioning.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a code accessible gain control for voices.
</li><li> [Studio] The "shipping" flag for builds has been removed in favor of separate build flags (use /? to view)
</li><li> [Runtime] EventGetDetails now checks the Gain2 in layers for distance falloff.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug where clearing the random state in a selector could affect other values.
</li><li> [Runtime] Layers now have a clip db level, where if their gains sum to less than that value, the layer is
prevented from being created.
</li><li> [Runtime] Layers can now specify their volume envelopes to be wall-clock instead of only percent completed.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a horizontal situation indicator to the client debugger that shows spatialized events relative to
the listener.
</li><li> [Studio] A bunch of readability improvements to various Client Debugger screens.
</li><li> [Studio] Added the ability to replay a recorded miles capture from within Miles Studio (Tools-&gt;Run Replay)
</li><li> [Studio] UI for deprecated availability cleaned up.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a switch which causes controllers to only take the initial value they are set to, and never
change afterwards.
</li><li> [Runtime] Angle and Distance controller types are now checked in MilesEventReferencesControllers.
</li><li> [Studio] Function controllers now properly respond to the view for editing in transforms.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with importing &gt; 1 event at a time in the csv remapper.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a flag to disable the minimum 1k preload for sounds. Disabling this breaks manifest compatibility
with deployed audio (i.e. you cannot patch projects that were deployed with this flag changed.) Change in
Project Settings.
</li><li> [Runtime] Setting a 0ms preload now properly causes voices to wait for data instead of thinking a valid preload
exists.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug with solo/mute and Flatten Names being set.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a UI bug where the angle type in controllers was displayed backwards (source to listener was
actually a listener to source controller).
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with MilesEventReferencesControllers failing due to event compression.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a way to add latency to reads for simulating slow drives.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a flag to events that causes all voices to wait if any would wait, so they remain in sync. This
defaults to on.
</li><li> [Studio] Added a search filter to the Assets view to find on action index (@action = number)
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a variety of minor read prioritization bugs and improved the congestion model.
</li><li> [Studio] Massive improvements to the Asyncs view in the client debugger. Now called "Reads", it allows for skipping to
data mutes/delays and starvation, as well as better monitoring of the read backlog. Also, the reason for the data

</li><li> [Runtime] A capture API has been added, but is currently implemented only on linux.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a bug where marking a tree of events as deprecated wouldn't work.
</li><li> [Runtime] The default voice orientation has been updated to be in line with the default listener orientation.
</li><li> [Studio] Added the ability to specify the direction and distance of an event from Miles Studio. The event is
placed on the same 2d plane as the listener (identified by forward and left vectors), and is not moved after creation.
Event's with manual positioning ignore positioning specified by the game. This position can also be in world coordinates,
which will use the X/Z plane in that case.
</li><li> [Studio] Added Random and Oscillator controller types.
</li><li> [Studio] Added the ability to timelock a source selector. When a voice selects a branch or child in a selector,
if timelocked, the voice will 'lock' the result for the given time in milliseconds. Any voice that uses that selector
during that time will use the same result, until the lock expires. Then a new result is chosen using the selectors
rules.
</li><li> [Runtime] Miles no longer reports that there is no audio device on systems with no audio device if the game
requested a null or memory output device.

the 'overlapping buffers are undefined' behavior.
</li><li> [Studio] Notes and labels can be edited from the Assets view, and can be used as a search filter.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added a basic Gain filter. Currently for performance this filter alters the final volume scaling instead of
running a full buffer multiply, and as such will not work correctly when placed before a non-linear filter
(e.g compressor, gainblock).
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed a crash when undoing a deleted bank.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with volume and pitch controllers bound to Layers.
</li><li> [Studio] Added the ability to randomize most properties that can be bound to a controller. The result is selected from a range

</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.23 - Nov 2, 2017</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] Added a way to hide the individual actions in the events list (right click on an event to see the option)
</li><li> [Studio] The assets view now retains the bulk copy properties after an asset refresh.
</li><li> [Studio] Properties bound to graph templates now show the controller in the Assets tab.
</li><li> [Studio] Added the ability to mark an event "deprecated", which prevents the event from being compiled when the
project is rendered.
</li><li> [Studio] Fixed an issue where in high traffic auditions, the game and Miles Studio could get stuck waiting for
each other to receive data.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed an issue with multichannel send delays.
</li><li> [Studio] MilesEventReferencesControllers has been updated to be consistent with what the event compiler believes
the event uses.
</li><li> [Runtime] Drivers will now report when no audio devices seem to be present.
</li><li> [Runtime] Stop transitions now always ignore transition lockouts.
</li><li> [Studio] Added filter chain templates. Events and Play actions can assign a filter template, which defines the filters on
the asset. Filter parameters can be overridden at any level, and everything is propogated to "children". E.g. if an event
selects a filter template, all of the play actions in that event will use that template, and if the event overrides a given
property, all of the play actions will inherit that override. Filter chain templates can be created from an existing filter
chain, or in the Templates tab. The templates tab also provides a way to find all assets that have the same filter structure,
allowing all to be set to the template. Currently, filter templates do not work for buses.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug where send delay buffers could be leaked in certain use cases.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with setting voice position on uncompressed sources.
</li><li> [Studio] Graphs of Time properties no longer use 16 million as the vertical axis when editing.
</li><li> [Studio] The results from controllers and graphs are now properly clamped to property limits to prevent out-of-bounds results.
</li><li> [Runtime] The convolution reverb has been more optimized to handle longer impulse responses.
</li><li> [Runtime] The convolution reverb now properly handles changes to the selected impulse response while
audio is running through the filter.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for volume min/max variance not being properly editable when a controller is bound.
</li><li> [Studio] Source selector nodes can be marked as "Latches", which prevents further evaluations of the source
node <i>for the same voice</i> from selecting a different branch.
</li><li> [Runtime] Smoothing controllers should now work in all cases.
</li><li> [Studio] Graph Templates now have a menu option (off the gear) to mark users of the graph as audition dirty so that edits
can be applied during audition.
</li><li> [Studio] The Assets view now defaults to NOT automatically overridding inherited values when setting properties. To allow
the old behavior, there is a checkbox at the top of the tab.
</li><li> [Studio] Added "Initial Delay" property to events and play actions. Acts as Delay, except only on initial start instead
of every state entry.
</li><li> [Runtime] Adjusted the parametric EQ filter to be more numerically stable.
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.22 - Sept 7, 2017</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] Fix for certain configurations of source selectors

</li><li> [Studio] Drop highlighting in source selectors is more clear
</li><li> [Runtime] Bus controllers with no bound bus no longer crashes.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for graph template reference resolution failure during load.
</li><li> [Studio] Batch Property Copy has been added to the Assets tab. Multiple properties can be copied from a single
asset, and pasted in to any number of assets. Right click on the property in the assets list heading to add
the property to the batch copy, then right click on the name of an asset and select "Copy Batch Properties".
Once copied, select a set of assets, right click, and select "Paste Batch Properties" to apply.
</li><li> [Runtime] Project recreation due to changes during auditioning has been updated to transition voices to the
new bus hierarchy more consistently.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for a corruption issue with long controller functions.
</li><li> [Runtime] Volume envelopes no longer crash when there is no currently active layer.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for a compress cache issue when Miles Studio shuts down with outstanding compressions.
</li><li> [Runtime] The transition lockout has been removed currently due to being longer than some voices. It will
return at some point with appropriate UI for controlling it.
</li><li> [Runtime] MilesEventGetStarvedVoiceCount now actually returns nonzero when voices starve.
</li><li> [Studio] The edit box for function controllers is now longer.
</li><li> [Studio] Send delays are now editable in the assets view.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fix for multichannel send delays.
</li><li> [Runtime] The max registered convolution reverb count has been upped to 32 for iteration purposes. Note that actually shipping with
this many in active use would likely be a performance issue!
</li></ul><h2><span class="section"><b> 10.0.21 - Aug 14, 2017</b></span></h2><ul><li> [Studio] IMPORTANT - Compress Cache has been dramatically updated. All sources will be recompressed on project load after
upgrading.
</li><li> [Studio] Compress cache is now unique to the project file.
</li><li> [Studio] Compress cache is now 3 files instead of 1 per source wav.
</li><li> [Studio] Compress cache is now correctly locked for multiple process access, allowing multiple instances of Miles Studio.
Trying to write to a cache that is open for read in another process (ie the project is being rendered) will cause the
source compression to fail, and it will need to be recompressed in Miles Studio.
</li><li> [Studio] Compress cache relative paths are forced relative to the Miles Studio EXE, instead of the OS current directory.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added accessor for hardware starvation count. Increments when the hardware API buffers fall to zero (ie when Miles
isn't getting enough CPU time or has too high of a processing load.)
</li><li> [Runtime] Added play action switches and conditions. Events can have switches, which will play a given play action
based on the value of a controller. Actions can either be bound to a switch, or have a conditional controller, where
the play action will only play if the controller is &gt; 0.
</li><li> [Runtime] Voice priority can now be bound to a controller. What was Zero Priority before is now a separate flag called "Evict Last".
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug with muted voices not necessarily ending.
</li><li> [Studio] Copy and Paste now works in the Templates tab list box.
</li><li> [Studio] Template list box can be resized.

</li><li> [Studio] Convert Controllers have been reenabled after a long hiatus.
</li><li> [Runtime] Added an API to decode a saved queue buffer to a human-readable format.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a bug where if a layer was scheduled to stop before it ever started, it wouldn't ever start, no matter
how far in the future the stop was scheduled.
</li><li> [Studio] Sources now no longer store metadata regarding the file in perforce, preventing sync issues with source data from
creating needless perforce accesses.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a crash with empty play actions in MilesGetEventDetails.
</li><li> [Studio] Auditioning no longer potentially reads the wrong source data when files are updated and recompressed during audition.

</li><li> [Runtime] Routed Sends bound to controller values that output to Dynamic Routes (I need better names) now properly update.
</li><li> [Runtime/Studio] Virtual buses can now define a 3D Falloff Bias that is added to the 3D volume for voices that route through
the bus. This falloff can be bound to sample controllers (i.e. distance controllers) to adjust overall falloffs for voices,
and is crossfaded for dynamic routes.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fix for controllers not updating their respective targets when a sample is created, unless the controller is
changed after the voice is activated.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fix for MilesQueueEventStartTime not working since the introduction of state based events.

</li><li> [Runtime] Fix for certain crashes with muted samples.
</li><li> [Runtime] Fixed a crash with relative age priority adjustments

the path can change while the voice is running, crossfading over a set number of milliseconds.
</li><li> [Runtime] Stingers are now scheduled from when the state's source starts, rather than when the transition begins.
</li><li> [Runtime] Entry cues now properly adjust the source start times when transitioning voice states.
</li><li> [Studio] Fix for right-click deleting sources in a selector could delete the wrong entry.

</li><li> [Studio] Preview values for controllers as well as certain dragger positions are now saved across execution.
</li><li> Sources can now have BPM and signature specified for them, as well as an entry and exit cue marker. Currently
BPM and signature are constant across the entire source. Beats are tracked from the entry cue marker.
</li><li> [Studio] Source Properties now renders the waveform and allows for creating new markers that were not present
in the source wav file.
</li><li> Stingers - Voice States can now have "stingers" specified that will play when a set of conditions are met.

an updated AILDRVR.LST file.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Support for the Borland Power Pack and Zortech/Symantec compiler packages is
now available. Please note that by default, the MSS system is built for the
more popular Watcom/Rational package. To use MSS with any other compiler/DOS
extender package, it is necessary to delete all .OBJ, .LIB, and .EXE files and
recompile the desired library version. The .MDI and .DIG drivers, as well as
the files in the TOOLS subdirectory, do not need to be rebuilt.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Four new functions provide a `master volume` control for all digital samples
and XMIDI sequences: AIL_set_digital_master_volume, AIL_set_XMIDI_master_volume,
AIL_digital_master_volume, and AIL_XMIDI_master_volume</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Please note that like the AIL_set_sequence_volume function,
AIL_set_XMIDI_master_volume will not have the desired effect on sequences
which do not include MIDI Part Volume controllers (7) at the beginning of each
track. Refer to the updated documentation for further information on these
functions.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>The function AIL_register_beat_callback has been added to allow applications
to request callback service at sequence beat transition points. Refer to the
description of this function AND the AIL_sequence_position function in
the documentation before attempting to use either function!</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>The function AIL_MDI_driver_type has been added to help applications
identify the synthesis technology provided by various MSS drivers. This
function may be used to select different XMIDI sequences for various sound
synthesis platforms. Refer to the documentation for details.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>A new XMIDI controller has been implemented. The XMIDI Channel Mute
controller (107) can be used to selectively mute channels in sequences. Refer
to the updated documentation for information on the XMIDI Channel Mute
controller.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>The prototypes of the AIL_install_DIG_INI and AIL_install_MDI_INI functions
have been changed to provide enhanced error-reporting capabilities. It is
now possible to distinguish between failure due to a missing .INI file and
failure due to driver initialization or hardware detection problems. Refer
to the updated documentation file for details.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Previous versions of MSS truncated 16-bit sample data to 8-bit sample data
when panpot or volume scaling was used (panpot != 64 or volume &lt; 127). With
this release, 16-bit sample data is scaled with a multiply/shift sequence that
preserves full 16-bit sample precision.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>For consistency with the new Windows MSS package, the DIG_DRIVER * and
MDI_DRIVER * data types have been replaced with the HDIGDRIVER and HMDIDRIVER
handle types, respectively. The old pointer types may still be used, but
new applications should be written with the new handle types for compatibility
with the Windows MSS API.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Previous versions of MSS shut down interrupts during the digital mixing
process, which caused problems with high-speed serial communications. By
default, MSS V3.03 no longer disables interrupts at any time during digital
audio processing. A new preference name, DIG_SS_LOCK, has been added to
allow applications to restore the former behavior of shutting down
interrupts while updating the DMA buffer. Few applications should need
to change the DIG_SS_LOCK preference value.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>When playing a stereo digital audio sample on a monaural sound card, previous
versions of MSS truncated the right channel source data and played only the
left channel data. MSS V3.03 allows the AIL_set_sample_pan function to
fade linearly between the left and right source channel in this situation.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>In previous versions of MSS, it was possible under exceptionally rare
conditions for a nested INT 8 interrupt to cause crashes due to stack
corruption. Under Windows 95, however, the probability of protection faults
and crashes is greatly increased. This bug has been fixed for this release
of MSS; additionally, Windows 95 itself has been patched to correct the bug
in legacy applications by automatically modifying the faulty instructions
in the MSS INT 8 ISR. Customers with the retail release of Windows 95 should
not be affected; however, early beta versions (pre-490) can exhibit problems.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>A minor bug in the digital mixer code caused clipping tests to be performed
even with only one actively-playing sample. This bug has been fixed for
this release, resulting in faster digital audio performance.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>The AIL_resume_sample function could fail to operate properly if no other
samples were playing at the time it was called. This has been fixed.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Reports have been received of lockups with Sound Blaster 16 daughterboards
(such as those from Roland and Creative Labs) which occasionally occur
during extremely intense bursts of MIDI traffic while digital audio is in
use. The MSS MPU401 driver has been patched to provide a partial workaround
for this problem; however, momentary digital audio glitches may still be noted
during fast volume fades and other periods of high MIDI activity.
Because this problem is due to a hardware bug in the Creative chipset, no
completely reliable software workaround is currently known. However,
difficulties arising from the bug are quite rare and should not be a cause
for concern with most applications.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>AIL_start_sequence formerly reset the sequence loop count (if any) to 1,
effectively disabling any loop count previously established by
AIL_set_sequence_loop_count. This has been fixed in version 3.03 --
AIL_set_sequence_loop_count may now be called either before or after
playback begins.</b></b></b></li></ul><h2><b><b><b><span class="section"><b></b></span></b></b></b></h2><ul><li><b><b><b>The DRIVERS directory now contains a complete MSS driver configuration
program (SETSOUND.EXE) which may be included in your application. SETSOUND
must be executed before any of the MSS example programs in the DRIVERS
directory can be run. Consequently, the example programs no longer require
driver filenames to be specified directly on their command lines.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>SETSOUND is very easy to use and can shave days or weeks of programming time
from an application's development cycle. However, you should refer to
SETSOUND's complete description in the Tools Reference section of the manual
to help you get the most out of this powerful new utility.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>The contents of the old MIDI and DIGITAL directories have been merged into
the outer DRIVERS directory. Minor revisions have been made to the example
programs and makefiles to accommodate this change.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>SBLASTER.MDI, SBPRO1.MDI, and SBPRO2.MDI now check the BLASTER environment
variable to permit FM sound autodetection at addresses other than 220h.
Previously, only the Sound Blaster-series .DIG drivers checked the BLASTER
variable.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>DMA channel 0 is now available for use with Sound Blaster Pro adapters.
In earlier releases, DMA channel 0 worked only with Sound Blaster 16 boards.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>During autodetection, RAP10.DIG now checks addresses 330H and 320H, using DMA
channels 5 and 6 and IRQ 9. Formerly, IRQ 5 was tested with address 320H.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>The AIL_minimum_sample_buffer_size function could occasionally return
buffer sizes below the actual minimum size when used with the SBPRO.DIG
driver. This bug has been fixed.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>An error-checking problem in the SSTEST example program could cause GP faults
under rare circumstances. This bug has been fixed.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Updated Gravis UltraSound drivers are now available with this release. These
`native mode` drivers no longer require the ULTRAMID emulation program.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Two new drivers, ADRV688.DIG and PROAUDIO.DIG, are supplied for use with
ESS Technology's ES688 chipset and Media Vision's Pro Audio Spectrum line,
respectively. Many newer systems from Compaq and other vendors include the
ES688 device, which can support 16-bit stereo sound at up to 44 kHz through
the use of the new ADRV688.DIG driver. PROAUDIO.DIG has been tested and
found to give satisfactory performance on most systems; however, the Media
Vision cards' `native mode` has never been among the most reliable of sound
options, so users should be informed that the SBLASTER.DIG driver can be
used with most Pro Audio Spectrum boards in the event problems occur.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>First version of MSS for Windows is released as version 3.02 with full
MSS API support for 16-bit Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT.</b></b></b></li></ul><h2><b><b><b><span class="section"><b></b></span></b></b></b></h2><ul><li><b><b><b>The AIL_background function allows an application function to tell if it
is being executed from within an MSS timer, XMIDI, or callback function.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>The new AIL_set_sample_file function is similar to the existing
AIL_allocate_file_sample function, except that it operates on an existing
sample handle. .VOC or .WAV files may be played using an application's
own sample handles through the use of the AIL_set_sample_file function.
See the API Reference for further information.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>A powerful debugging feature has been added to the MSS API library. If an
AIL_DEBUG environment variable is created with a command of the form
SET AIL_DEBUG=filename, a timestamped log of virtually every MSS API call
made by any subsequently-executed MSS application will be recorded to the
text file or device `filename`. The logfile may be examined to help
diagnose and fix application errors. MSS functions called from within
callback functions will not be logged, along with the functions
AIL_switch_stack, AIL_restore_stack, AIL_unlock, AIL_lock, and
AIL_background.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Digital support for the Roland RAP-10 device is now available (RAP10.DIG).

mono or stereo formats. Use the MPU401.MDI driver for MIDI support with
the RAP-10.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Digital support for the New Media WaveJammer PCMCIA audio adapter is now
available (JAMMER.ZIP). Use the OPL2.MDI driver for MIDI support with
the WaveJammer.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Under certain circumstances, double-buffered samples could be terminated
prematurely in previous releases of MSS. This problem has been fixed.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>`Stuck` notes were occasionally reported when shutting down applications
using the Roland RAP-10 and Roland SB16 MIDI daughterboards. This MIDI
hardware overrun problem has been corrected by introducing a slight delay
into functions which flush the XMIDI note queue, such as AIL_end_sequence
and AIL_stop_sequence. This delay should not normally be perceptible
at the application level.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Revised guidelines for audio-video synchronization have been issued with
this release. The AIL_minimum_sample_buffer_size function returns the
size of the smallest memory block which may be used with the
double-buffering calls. Typically this value will range from 2 to 8KB;
applications must ensure that their video playback engines can provide
sound blocks of this size or greater. See the API Reference for further
information. The DBTEST.C example program now uses
AIL_minimum_sample_buffer_size to allocate its memory buffers. Note that
the `Guidelines for Audio/Video Synchronization` section that appeared in
earlier manual revisions is no longer applicable.</b></b></b></li><li><b><b><b>Under rare circumstances, MSS's built-in VMM locking calls could fail to
lock the last few bytes in a module. This problem was caused by Watcom's
