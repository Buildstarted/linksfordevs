Just leaves me wondering if I would've got the auto fix from Mozilla eventually if I hadn't done this myself. When I first logged on today (Monday in Australia), it still wasn't fixed.<p>To see all add-ons and theme disappear before my eyes with no explanation was pretty disconcerting and leads me to say that I totally disagree with Mozilla (or anyone else) having that kind of control. Bad policy (which it is) aside, though, someone dropped the ball big-time. I'm still astonished this was even allowed to happen, bad policy or not.

You're asking for viruses. I'd strongly recommend installing linux on your machine and using that instead.</p><p>Linux Mint Xfce 32 bit <i>might</i> manage to run on your system, but your pushing up against the minimum requirements for doing so. If it does run well enough it is IMHO the easiest distro for a new user to use.</p><p>If you find it doesn't, Debian with (again) xfce should run just fine. Debian isn't exactly scary to install, but it's scarier than mint for a new user.</p><p>I can't promise full support, but if you need a pointer in the right direction while installing linux, feel free to email me at morenzg@google's mail service here.com (since I'm unlikely to see any replies here).

If it doesn't I'm not sure what to suggest, and I can't realistically debug something too complex over HN comments.
