<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the things that even­tu­ally be­came ap­par­ent to me as I promised my­self to write more and more on this blog: I needed some vis­i­bil­ity.</p><p>Am I get­ting any read­er­ship at all? Or am I just talk­ing into a void? If I have read­ers, which of my con­tent is get­ting views?</p><p>Being pri­vacy-con­scious, the last thing I wanted to do was pull up the Google Analytics dash­board, copy its snip­pet on to this site, and call it a day.</p><p>So, I looked around.</p><h2>Picking an an­a­lyt­ics ser­vice</h2><h3>Netlify</h3><p>While I no longer use Netlify (more on that soon), their Analytics prod­uct looked good. They would sim­ply ex­pose the data from their server logs in a nice <span>UI</span>, zero JavaScript in­volved.</p><p>With no free tier in place, I <a href="https://community.netlify.com/t/cheaper-tier-for-analytics/13283" title="https://community.netlify.com/t/cheaper-tier-for-analytics/13283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opened a fea­ture re­quest</a> on their com­mu­nity fo­rums for a cheaper tier than the one they have as on the date of my re­quest - $9/month.</p><blockquote><p>I’m a free­lance de­vel­oper from India. I have a small blog on a site I host on Netlify that I’d like some vis­i­bil­ity on. Are there any plans for a cheaper tier? 25k pageviews for $9/mo or $90/yr is sim­ply out of my bud­get, and of most Indians too. Perhaps some­thing in the range of $3/mo or $30/yr for 7.5k-8.5k views? I do feel there’s an eco­nomic sweet spot for the non-US peo­ple us­ing Netlify that goes un­rec­og­nized in most tech com­pa­nies. Perhaps this could be use­ful for even smaller, in­die blogs within the <span>US</span>.</p><p>Google Play store has re­gional pric­ing on many apps and games, which al­lows peo­ple like me to be able to af­ford paid tiers even when I’m not mak­ing my money in <span>USD</span>.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, a re­sponse from their Support Engineer in­di­cates this is not go­ing to change any­time soon. That said, I still hope it was at least dis­cussed in­ter­nally, and even put into a <em>Someday</em> list.</p><h3>Piwik/Matomo</h3><p>Almost in­stinc­tively, the next search was for Piwik, hav­ing heard great re­views on mul­ti­ple plat­forms over the years.</p><p>Rebranded as <a href="https://matomo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matomo Analytics</a>, even their re­gional pric­ing was not con­vinc­ing.</p><p>As of to­day, it stands at ₹1590/month for just 3 sites and an ap­pro­pri­ately set 50,000 page-views limit. By <span>PPP</span>, that’s an as­ton­ish­ing US$87/month, ap­prox­i­mately. Or with­out <span>PPP</span>, still an enor­mous $US21/month, ap­prox­i­mately.</p><p>This was not sus­tain­able in the slight­est.</p><h3>Plausible</h3><p>I came across <a href="https://fosstodon.org/web/accounts/169770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marko Saric</a> pro­mot­ing <a href="https://plausible.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plausible Analytics</a> as an al­ter­na­tive to Google’s of­fer­ing on Fosstodon, and de­cided to check that out next.</p><p>Honestly, they look like the most bal­anced an­a­lyt­ics ser­vice for some­one just start­ing out. It’s a rel­a­tively new startup, but the prod­uct on of­fer seems good. Their user-in­ter­face is sim­ple and clean, and they don’t use cook­ies. No con­ﬁg­u­ra­tion is needed to get an­a­lyt­ics up and run­ning. It works out of the box. Part of that is of course how lim­ited the in­for­ma­tion is — it ﬁts on a sin­gle page — and that’s a good thing!</p><p>My search ended with Plausible. It’s a pay-only ser­vice but has a <em>rel­a­tively af­ford­able</em> tier at US$5/month or US$48/year for un­lim­ited sites and 10,000 page-views per month across all sites added.</p><p>I have also taken the time to <a href="https://plausible.nolt.io/103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cre­ate an idea for <span>PPP</span> pric­ing</a> on their ideas page. I hope it sees light of day one day.</p><h2>Five weeks in, how do I feel?</h2><p>I have had Plausible on my site for about ﬁve weeks now.</p><p>Notably, I have:</p><ul><li>seen 297 unique vis­i­tors from 32 coun­tries,</li><li>found out I have been listed on three blog-rolls - <a href="https://kevq.uk/blogroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kev Quirk’s</a>, <a href="https://jlelse.blog/blogroll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jan-Lukas Else’s</a>, and <a href="https://blogs.sirodoht.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sirodoht’s</a>,</li><li>had <a href="https://rusingh.com/articles/2020/05/14/eleventy-exclude-draft-collection-items-programmatically/">one of my ar­ti­cle</a> listed on what seems to be <a href="https://eleventythemes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an up­com­ing re­source for Eleventy</a>.</li></ul><p>Well, then… do I feel mo­ti­vated?</p><p>It seems a lit­tle point­less now, that I ever was con­cerned. Of course, I do feel mo­ti­vated! I am <strong>thrilled</strong>! <span><img draggable="false" alt="😄" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/12.1.5/svg/1f604.svg"></span> These might look like rookie num­bers or ac­com­plish­ments, but I want to ac­knowl­edge that this is al­ready much more than I ex­pected when I started with the re­solve to write more.</p><p>I also know that by pro­mot­ing my RSS/Atom feed as the pri­mary and only sub­scrip­tion method, I lose out on some an­a­lyt­ics, but I re­ally don’t care. Every one should have the op­tion to read my blog how­ever they best feel com­fort­able and what­ever they ﬁnd con­ve­nient.</p><h2>Privacy pol­icy</h2><p>I have also <a href="https://rusingh.com/privacy-policy/">in­cor­po­rated a pri­vacy pol­icy on my site</a> now, which in­cludes in­for­ma­tion on an­a­lyt­ics, how I use them, and how you can opt out — psst… just add <em>goals.rus­ingh.com</em> to your ad block ﬁl­ters.</p><p>If you have any ques­tions, shoot me an email and I’ll add more de­tails to the page if re­quired.</p></div></div></div>
