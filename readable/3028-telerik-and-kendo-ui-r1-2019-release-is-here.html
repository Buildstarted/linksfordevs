Check out everything that's new, including new components, hundreds of improvements and the all-new Telerik UI for Blazor.</span></p><p>At Progress, we pride ourselves on the day zero support our Telerik and Kendo UI products provide for new development frameworks and tooling. As engineers ourselves, we like to tinker with newest technologies â€“ both at work and at home. Transferring what weâ€™ve discovered into articles and easy to use products is what drives every one of us â€“ ultimately seeing you productive and successful in creating sleek and modern user interfaces.</p><p>The R1 2019 release builds on that drive and promise to you to be the first to market, and today we maybe go even one step further â€“ throwing our support behind the still experimental Blazor framework from Microsoft. And of course, bringing you over 50 new components and 300+ improvements across all frameworks and platforms. Read on for more details, and for those of you who just want to get the bits right away, you can <a href="https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new">get them here</a>.</p><h2 id="telerik-ui-for-blazor-â€“-early-preview">Telerik UI for Blazor â€“ Early Preview</h2><p>If you havenâ€™t heard of <a href="http://www.blazor.net/">Blazor</a>, you should really check it out. Built by Daniel Rorth and Steve Sanderson as an experimental .NET web framework embracing WebAssembly to target web applications using C# and HTML. You read that right, your C# compiles to WebAssembly so no need for JavaScript! While the Blazor website itself provides a lot of information, I particularly liked the session Microsoftâ€™s John Galloway gave at our annual DevReach conference which really explains Blazor very well in less than 40 minutes - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnH2h_RJ-d8&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLvmaC-XMqeBYiMKlRATiIuxKF5Czb_aW7&amp;index=8">Blazor â€“ A New Framework for Browser-based .NET Apps (DevReach 2018)</a>.</p><p>By being the one of the first teams to throw our support behind a what is currently an experimental framework, we want to help Blazor mature faster and ensure the ecosystem around it is ready for all of you who are as passionate about it as we are.</p><p>So, whatâ€™s in the early preview of Telerik UI for Blazor? Today we are releasing our own Data Grid for Blazor with some essential first functionality like data binding, sorting, paging, theming etc. In addition to the Blazor Grid, we are also releasing two more components â€“ the Blazor Button and TabStrip! As this is a preview our resources are a bit limited, but you can sign up and get ahold of a copy of the bits via our NuGet repository by following <a href="https://www.telerik.com/download-trial-file/v2-b/ui-for-blazor" title="" class="" target="">this link</a>.</p><p><strike>We will follow-up this announcement with more blogs, including how to get started, over the next couple of days so keep an eye out for more information on how to start using these components!</strike></p><p>We've just published a detailed blog post by Ed Charbeneau on how to get started with Telerik UI for Blazor.
