    <div><div class="col-md-6 team_member"> <figure class="animated fadeInLeft"> <img src="/Content/img/team/Carl.jpg" alt> <figcaption><a href="#">Carl Franklin</a></figcaption> </figure> <p> Carl Franklin is Executive Vice President of<a href="http://appvnext.com/"> App vNext</a>, a software development firm focused on the latest methodologies and technologies. Carl is a 20+ year veteran of the software industry, co-host and founder of<a href="http://dotnetrocks.com/"> .NET Rocks!</a>, the first and most widely listened to podcast for .NET developers, a<a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/"> Microsoft MVP</a> for <a href="http://kinectforwindows.com/">Kinect for Windows</a>, a Microsoft <a href="http://msrd.io/">Regional Director</a>, and Senior Executive of <a href="http://pwop.com/">Pwop Studios</a>, a full-service audio and video production/post production studio located in Southeastern Connecticut. </p> <p> He was awarded the MVP for Kinect because of his work on gesture recognition. Namely, <a href="https://github.com/carlfranklin/KinectToolsV2">KinectTools</a> and <a href="https://github.com/carlfranklin/GesturePak2V1">GesturePak</a>. KinectTools is an abstraction over the Kinect 2.0 SDK that takes the detail work out of using the Kinect in a Windows application. GesturePak lets you record, edit, and recognize gestures in a Windows application. Both are free open source products. </p> <p> Carl is also the creator of <a href="http://mtcb.pwop.com/">Music to Code By</a>, a set of 25-minute long instrumental music pieces designed to get you into a state of flow and keep you there. Music to Code By has been praised widely by developers for keeping them focused and helping them solve difficult problems. </p> <p> Carl has been a leader in the .NET community since 2002, and in the Visual Basic (VB) community before that. In the very early days he wrote for Visual Basic Programmer&#x2019;s Journal, authoring the Q&amp;A column of that magazine as well as many feature articles for VBPJ and other magazines. He has authored two books for John Wiley &amp; Sons on sockets programming in VB, and in 1994 he helped create the very first web site for VB developers, Carl &amp; Gary&apos;s VB Home Page. </p> <p>Before he started .NET Rocks! in 2002 (three years before the word &#x2018;podcast&#x2019; became popular) he developed and taught hands-on training classes for VB.NET and ASP.NET via his training company, Franklins.Net.</p> <p> Carl has spoken regularly at conferences around the world, such as <a href="http://devintersection.com">DevIntersection</a>, <a href="http://ndcoslo.com/">NDC</a>, <a href="http://ndc-london.com/">NDC London</a>, <a href="http://oredev.org/">OreDev</a>, Microsoft TechEd, Microsoft TechEd Europe, <a href="http://www.devteach.com/">DevTeach</a>, <a href="http://devreach.com/">DevReach</a>, and others. </p> <p> In addition to his work in the development field, Carl works in the music business as a composer, recording engineer, producer, multi-instrumentalist, and vocalist. With his band, the <a href="http://franklinbros.com">Franklin Brothers</a>, he has produced two albums, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lifeboat-To-Nowhere/dp/B005GNA54W/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313075380&amp;sr=301-1">Lifeboat to Nowhere</a> and <a href="http://carlfranklin.com">Been a While</a>. Both albums get nothing but five star reviews. Noted guitar virtuoso <a href="http://johnscofield.com">John Scofield</a> has collaborated with Carl on two songs, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHHkxVgcZq0">Chain Reaction</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkoY0YIVJZk">Groove or Get Out of the Way</a>. </p> </div><div class="col-md-6 team_member"> <figure class="animated fadeInRight"> <img src="/Content/img/team/Richard.jpg" alt> <figcaption><a href="#">Richard Campbell</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Richard Campbell started playing with microcomputers in 1977 at the age of 10. He&apos;s really never done anything else since. In that time he&apos;s been involved in every level of the PC industry, from manufacturing, to sales, to development, and into large scale infrastructure implementation. He has been a witness and participant to the Bill Gates vision of &quot;A PC on every desktop.&quot;</p> <p>For years he&apos;s served as a consultant to companies in many countries, including Barnes&amp;Noble.com, Dow Chemical, Johnson &amp; Johnson Health Care Services, Reuters, Subaru/Isuzu and the U.S. Air Force, providing advice on architecture, scaling systems and mentoring development teams. His long experience in working with large scale systems made him a sought-after consultant during the halycon years of the DotCom boom. He worked closely with venture capital and private equity firms providing architectural guidance and due diligence.</p> <p>He is a Microsoft Regional Director and is recognized as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) in the area of<a href="http://asp.net/">ASP.NET</a>&#xA0;development.</p> <p>In 2004 Richard first met Carl Franklin, creator of .NET Rocks (<a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">www.dotnetrocks.com</a>), The Internet Audio Talkshow for .NET Developers. Richard was a guest on show 69, but his friendship with Carl quickly evolved into a partnership and by show 100 in early 2005 he came onboard as co-host. In 2007 he started RunAs Radio (<a href="http://www.runasradio.com/">www.runasradio.com</a>), a podcast for IT Professionals.</p> <p>He is a co-founder of Strangeloop Networks, which was acquired by Radware in 2013 and spent five years on the board of directors of Telerik which was acquired by Progress Software in 2014.</p> <p>In 2012 Richard founded the Humanitarian Toolbox (<a href="http://www.htbox.org/">www.htbox.org</a>), an organization designed to let developers around the world donate their skills to disaster relief organizations by building open source software. By 2014, Humanitarian Toolbox became a 501(c)3 registered US charity, working on a number of different projects for the United Nations, US Center for Disease Control and Red Cross.</p> <p>Today Richard is a consultant and advisor to a number of successful technology firms as well as the co-owner and content planner of the DevIntersection (<a href="http://www.devintersection.com/">www.devintersection.com</a>) group of conferences.</p> </div></div>
