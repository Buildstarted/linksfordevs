    <p>Explains send a message to a queue, for more posts in this series go to Contents. In the previous post we looked at how queues can be created with the management client. For being able to send messages to queues we required the Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus package. If you search for Azure Service Bus on nuget you might stumble over the WindowsAzure.ServiceBus package, be aware that this is the old and new legacy Azure Service Bus client. For any new development you want to use the Microsoft.Azure...</p>

    <p>Explains how to create queues with the management client, for more posts in this series go to Contents. Without queues, topics and subscriptions (also called entities) there is not much we can do with an Azure Service Bus namespace. For the start it is sufficient enough to create a queue that we will use to send messages to and receive messages from. Creating entities requires a reference to the Microsoft.Azure.Management.ServiceBus package. In contrast to the older (new legacy Azure Service...</p>
