</ol><p><b><span>Probably Compromised</span></b><br>
Likely for more than those 4,611 users, based off of what was seen.<br>
What was discovered likely depends on the perceived value of the target.</p><ol>
<li data-xf-list-type="ol">Full conversations, perhaps all of them.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ol">Moderator boards, which is probably fine because it's really boring.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ol">Private boards, which is mostly shitposting anyways.</li>

Suggestion: Make a <a href="https://kiwifarms.net/forums/talk-to-staff.26/" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fkiwifarms.net%2Fforums%2Ftalk-to-staff.26%2F&amp;hash=f3b016586b747d9233b37f28c492bfc7">Talk to Staff</a> thread. You can either ask for a name change or an account deletion. I will do either no questions asked.<br>
If you want a name change, say which name in your post or I will give you one at random. (<a href="https://kiwifarms.net/forums/talk-to-staff.26/post-thread?title=Name%20Change%20Request" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fkiwifarms.net%2Fforums%2Ftalk-to-staff.26%2Fpost-thread%3Ftitle%3DName%2520Change%2520Request&amp;hash=d0f99037fddbb3fb4643b1243f3fd13b">Click to make thread</a>)<br>
If you want to delete your account, your posts will be given a new name as guest posts but your account data will be gone. If you have broken speech laws in your country (UK, NZ), I advise doing this.

<b>Help, I wasn't using a VPN!</b><br>
It is unlikely an IP will ever come back to haunt you. Even if you used a corporate or educational networks unprotected, the best an IP can do is say "this person is from there". It does not link back to you and would require a considerable amount of effort and cooperation from the ISP to trace to a single person. For domestic connections, IPs reveal your ISP, not your home. Your ISP can be on the same street or several cities away.</p><p>

This is an example of what information an IP gives.</p>
<p>
I do not feel in any way endangered by this information.</p><p>

<b>Help, I DM'd yawning sneasel my butthole (but otherwise my account is fine).</b><br>

<b>Help, I live in the UK and I said something bad about Muslims, please delete my posts.</b><br>
I am happy to delete accounts and give plausible deniability but I will not be deleting any content off the site.</p><p>

Side note: Deleting or renaming your account does not magically obliterate all references to your original username on the site and I will not be inventing something that does that.</p><p>

<span><b>Moving Forward</b></span><br>
I am completely abandoning all in-house monetization plans. (i.e. currency, account upgrades).<br>
Conversations will be automatically deleted over time.<br>
Policy on account deletions and renames will be reversed. Entirely, for now.</p><p>


<b><span>Privacy Refresher</span><br>
how to not use your .gov and .edu email addresses</b><br>
(If you're wondering, no. I banned all *.edu and *.gov domains and made existing ones change their email after the Vordrak downtime in 2017.)</p><p>

<b>1. Get a password manager</b><br>
I use LastPass, which is an excellent consumer password manager.<br>
<a href="https://lastpass.com/" target="_blank" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Flastpass.com%2F&amp;hash=550ab07385f111677ce6a8127b4d545c" rel="nofollow noopener">https://lastpass.com/</a></p><p>

... though the elite hackers would advocate using these.<br>
<a href="https://www.privacytools.io/software/passwords/" target="_blank" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privacytools.io%2Fsoftware%2Fpasswords%2F&amp;hash=660aec3c09d3b494262abecaf04183d9" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.privacytools.io/software/passwords/</a></p><p>

<b>2. Use Passphrases</b><br>
"A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week."<br>
is better than "xSDKj/s4202"</p><p>

The first is both a million times stronger and a million times easier to remember than a short, random string.</p><p>

<b>3. Set up alter egos</b><br>
i.e. segregate porn, wrongthink, personal, and government</p><p>

Providers can be found here.<br>
<a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/email/" target="_blank" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privacytools.io%2Fproviders%2Femail%2F&amp;hash=b9d2b4a68e27d12fd45c31e60d9c1c3b" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.privacytools.io/providers/email/</a></p><p>

<b>4. Use VPNs</b><br>
(Warning: Shill links for things I use.)<br>
<a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/cafe/kiwifar" target="_blank" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.privateinternetaccess.com%2Fpages%2Fcafe%2Fkiwifar&amp;hash=322535f76bf2567876f968c7ae39f2c1" rel="nofollow noopener">PrivateInternetAccess</a>, proven in court to not log IPs.<br>
<a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&amp;aff_id=32514" target="_blank" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.nordvpn.net%2Faff_c%3Foffer_id%3D15%26aff_id%3D32514&amp;hash=20dd641954829451f30c87ceaaef54e5" rel="nofollow noopener">NordVPN</a>, very popular consumer VPN but somewhat distrusted due to their aggressive marketing.</p><p>

For a general list, this website is <b>excellent</b> in general.</p>

Fake pictures (warning: some are awful and funny)<br>

<b>On a long enough timeline, every website you've ever used will be compromised.</b> The only way to adequately protect yourself is to proactively compartmentalize your data. No one can do this for you but you.</p></div>
