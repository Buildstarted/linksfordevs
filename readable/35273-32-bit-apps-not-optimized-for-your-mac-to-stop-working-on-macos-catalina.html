    <h1>32-Bit Apps &#x27;Not Optimized for Your Mac&#x27; to Stop Working on macOS Catalina</h1>
    <div id="contentContainer" class="blog article"> <div id="content" class="post"> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="body">When <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-10-14/">macOS Mojave</a> was announced, Apple warned that it would be the last version of macOS that would support older 32-bit apps. Apple has been phasing out 32-bit apps for the last 10 years and is now ready to take the final step, even if Mac users may not be ready to lose access to older apps. <p>
<img src="https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/32bitappssupport.jpg" alt width="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695230"></p><br>
In September, when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-10-15/">macOS Catalina</a> comes out, 32-bit app support will not be available, which means many of your older apps could potentially stop working if they&apos;re not updated to 64-bit. <p>
<img src="https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/06/mojave-32-bit-apps-800x305.jpg" alt width="800" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-639900"></p><br> 32-bit apps date back to a time when there were 32-bit processors and 32-bit operating systems, but are now outdated. Apple has long since transitioned to 64-bit processors and macOS has been 64-bit since the launch of Snow Leopard in 2009. Compared to 32-bit apps, 64-bit apps can take advantage of more memory and offer faster system performance. Apple technologies like Metal only work with 64-bit apps, and for Apple to ensure that Mac apps include all of the latest advancements and optimizations, support for 32-bit needs to end. In the simplest terms, 32-bit apps are inefficient. <p>
32-bit apps <em>can</em> run on a 64-bit system as they&apos;ve been doing for years, but Apple wants to get rid of outdated apps to make sure everything that runs on the Mac is properly optimized and isn&apos;t an unnecessary drain on system resources. </p> Apple started warning Mac users about plans to end support for 32-bit apps back with macOS High Sierra. In High Sierra, users started getting warnings about a 32-bit app&apos;s future incompatibility with macOS. <p>
<img src="https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/06/32-bit-app-warning-mojave-800x352.jpg" alt width="800" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-639901"></p>
A similar message is available in macOS Mojave, and if you open up a 32-bit app while running Mojave, you&apos;re going to see an alert letting you know a specific app won&apos;t work with future versions of macOS unless it&apos;s updated. Alerts re-appear every 30 days when launching an app, with Apple aiming to make sure customers will not be caught unaware when a 32-bit app stops working in the future. If you&apos;re a developer and you update to the beta of macOS Catalina, as soon as you update you&apos;ll be shown a list of 32-bit apps that no longer work on your system. <br>
To determine whether an app is 64-bit or 32-bit and to see if there are 32-bit apps installed on your machine, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/identify-32-bit-apps-mac/">follow these steps</a>:<br>
<ol><br> <li>Click the Apple symbol (&#xF8FF;) in the menu bar on your Mac&apos;s desktop.</li><br> <li>Click on About This Mac.</li><br> <li>Choose &quot;System Report&quot; at the bottom of the window.</li><br> <li>Scroll down to the Software list on the sidebar.</li><br> <li>Select &quot;Applications.&quot;</li><br> <li>Scroll all the way to the right to see the 64-bit list.</li><br>
</ol> Anything in this list that has a &quot;Yes&quot; next to it is 64-bit and does not need to be updated. Anything that says &quot;No&quot; will need to be updated. <p>
<img src="https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/32bitapps-800x497.jpg" alt width="800" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-691386"></p><br> <br>
The first step is to make sure there aren&apos;t already available updates for apps that you have on your system, which you can generally do by updating through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-app-store/">Mac App Store</a> for Mac App Store apps. Apps outside of the Mac App Store use other update methods that can vary by app, but for many, you can click on the app&apos;s name in the menu bar and choose the &quot;Check for Updates&quot; option. Some other apps have more hidden update methods, so if you do have a 32-bit app, make sure to Google how to update it to be sure there&apos;s not already new software available. After ensuring you&apos;ve updated everything you&apos;re able to update, you can contact developers and ask them to update their apps, but if that doesn&apos;t pan out, the only other solution is to start the search for an alternative app now so you&apos;re ready when the next-generation version of macOS launches. <br>
There are many apps that are going to stop working. One major example is Aperture, and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/30/aperture-wont-run-beyond-macos-mojave/">recently warned</a> current Aperture users that Aperture is not going to run on future versions of macOS. If you&apos;re an Aperture user, now is the time to transition to alternate photo editing and management software, such as Adobe&apos;s Lightroom. <br>
Certain media files that use older formats and codecs are also not going to be compatible with macOS after macOS Mojave due to the 64-bit transition, and you will need to convert some <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209029">iMovie</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209000">Final Cut Pro X</a> libraries. Incompatible media files were created using codecs that rely on QuickTime 7, and while macOS Mojave has QuickTime 7 frameworks, future versions of macOS will not. <p>
Apple has a full list of media formats that are going to be affected by the transition <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209000">available in a support document</a>.</p> In macOS Mojave and earlier versions of macOS like High Sierra, you can continue to use your 32-bit apps. If you have a 32-bit app that you absolutely depend on, you&apos;re going to want to think twice before upgrading to macOS Catalina when it&apos;s released. <br>
