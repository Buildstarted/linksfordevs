<h5>WHAT IS 5G?</h5>
<p>5G refers to the “5th generation” wireless technology. Its intended purpose is to provide faster and higher capacity transmissions to carry the massive amount of data that industry projects will be generated from the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities,<a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2018/will-driverless-cars-cause-dna-damage-and-cancer/?fbclid=IwAR1KvAnui_Q4toUvsmYtGbUi4Q5ZMKRmfHxe33cuOnwFJyE4c7LbnFb1TxE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> driverless cars</a>, video streaming, augmented reality and more. It is not clear yet how 5G will be achieved, so at present, it is being used more as a marketing term.</p>
<p>What <strong><em>is</em></strong> clear is that the plan is for 5G to include the higher millimeter wave (MMW) frequencies never before used for Internet and Telecommunications technology. These waves do not travel well through buildings, so according to industry, 5G would require hundreds of thousands of new so-called “small cells” aka <em>Wireless Telecommunications Facilities (WTFs)</em>. (In 2017, a number of wireless companies stated that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=FwAsr1pC13Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5G signals can travel 3000 feet</a> – over half a mile – which would seem to contradict the original rationale for needing small cells.) Regardless of what the facts are, the wireless telecom industry is aggressively seeking to outfit lampposts and utility poles around the country with <a href="https://whatis5g.info/photo-gallery-of-small-cells/">microwave antennas</a> beaming hazardous radiation next to, and into our homes, 24/7.</p>
<p>5G cell tower antennas will be supplemented by and integrated with&nbsp;<a href="http://no5g.info/2019/03/12/international-council-on-a-space-based-internet-communication-system-initial-deployment-of-up-to-25000-communication-satellites/?fbclid=IwAR3cKwcYISAwby-2Pyz85g2GQmgHbGSqTjaCKE3s7ATmqfpqlB3RjKQa3mg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">space-based communications systems</a>, aka satellites. <a href="https://www.5gspaceappeal.org/the-appeal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thousands of new satellites</a> are scheduled to be launched by 2020 to ensure that every inch of the planet is sufficiently irradiated to support ubiquitous high speed wireless capability.</p>
<p>In light of the robust and ever growing <strong><em>independent</em></strong> <a href="https://www.telecompowergrab.org/science.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">science</a> showing adverse health effects from radiofrequency/microwave radiation, the densification of our neighborhoods, communities, and the world with 5G-infrastructure complemented by the saturation of our skies with satellites may prove to be a <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2017/03/internet-things-cause-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very ill-conceived idea.</a></p>
<h5>WHAT IS THE INTERNET OF THINGS?</h5>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT), as being marketed and sold to the public, is a vision of connecting every “thing” possible to the Internet – all machines, appliances, objects, devices, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45473786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">animals</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuLtaHU0bP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insects</a> and even <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/zuckerberg-wants-facebook-to-build-mind-reading-machine/?fbclid=IwAR2rt-nvVgZPALAQzqvwFmYa47VTVdIPGjRsgAU8nHrPk2qCTSGHpr-4x1Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our brains</a>. In addition, the IoT will include <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/13/a-i-will-be-billions-of-times-smarter-than-humans-man-and-machine-need-to-merge.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs&amp;feature=share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">augmented reality (AR)</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/26/cows-with-vr-headsets/?fbclid=IwAR3n0JwtpMXf0OwhHXtppOaTWgeymPJiDwIByOxSU1QuT9sXLkxk5MvAGUo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual reality</a> (VR), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSBcG-SStqc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">robots</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAzfUz5Nh-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">microchipped humans</a>, and <a href="http://humanxdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">augmented humans</a> (humans with some form of technology implanted or integrated into their biology to “enhance” human characteristics or capabilities).<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=35&amp;v=pnAh4dJfa4I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> IoT sensors</a> and <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/most-spied-on-cities-in-the-world.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveillance cameras</a> will pepper our communities as well.&nbsp;New IoT cyber physical systems will render&nbsp;all objects “smart” – i.e. connected to the Cloud – thus enabling pervasive machine-to-machine (M2M) communications and <a href="https://whatis5g.info/data-internet-of-things/">massive data collection</a> and leaving us open to <a href="https://whatis5g.info/cybersecurity-vulnerability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">devastating cyber attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the IoT products currently being manufactured include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/03/who-should-die-when-a-driverless-car-crashes-qa-ponders-the-future?CMP=twt_a-technology_b-gdntech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">driverless cars</a>, clothing, toasters, and coffee makers.

There are <a href="https://www.internetcrime.com/blog/2016/april/smart-mattresses-with-infidelity-detection-syste/">“smart” mattresses</a> (with infidelity detection systems), <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Smart-toothbrushes-the-latest-Internet-of-Things-7971669.php">“smart” toothbrushes</a> to record and notify you how well you are brushing, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/device-harvests-energy-stomach-sends-wifi-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WiFi connected pills </a>to transmit health data to your physician, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/devices/monitoring-heart-health-one-toilet-seat-at-a-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smart” toilets.</a> The IoT even includes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/technology/100000003731634/the-uncanny-lover.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sex-bots</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.glamour.com/story/a-bluetooth-tampon-will-soon-exist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bluetooth tampons</a>, and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/family/vagina-speakers-the-latest-gadget-for-pregnant-women-seriously/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baby pods</a>&nbsp;mothers can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtWmfqTWu5Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insert to serenade their unborn baby,</a> and, sorry to say, even <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/icon-condom-app_us_58b911e0e4b0b99894167584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smart condoms</a> to measure performance.</p>
<p>Every IoT “thing”, including robots, sensors, surveillance cameras, and augmented reality, will <a href="https://whatis5g.info/data-internet-of-things/">generate personal usage-data</a>, which will be mined, stored, and used by government, law enforcement, industry, and hackers.</p>
<p>Every&nbsp;IoT “thing”, including robots, sensors, surveillance cameras, and augmented reality, will increase our exposure to pulsed microwave radiation – known to <a href="https://mdsafetech.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adversely impact both humans</a> and <a href="https://mdsafetech.org/environmental-and-wildlife-effects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wildlife</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although government and industry promote the IoT as the panacea for all ills, the IoT itself creates a host of problems.This website delineates nine ways that 5G and the IoT will cause serious harms to humans, wildlife, and our Earth. After exploring this website and conducting further research, you may decide the hoped for, and hyped about benefits of 5G and the IoT do not outweigh the very serious harms and you may choose to not buy into 5G/IoT both figuratively and literally.</p>
<p>If you would like to join the growing number of people, communities, and cities around the world that are saying NO to 5g, please check out the <a href="https://whatis5g.info/small-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Take Action</a> section of this website.</p></div>
