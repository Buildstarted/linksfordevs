            Most economists think of economics as a science. But are they right? If so, what kind of science is it? You can put on the uniform of a policeman, but does that make you a policeman?
 
These, and more questions, are answered in this fourth lecture in INET’s “How and How Not to Do Economics, with Robert Skidelsky.”
 
INET sincerely thanks the Julis-Rabinowitz Family for their generous support, who named this series to honor the spirit of a great educator and economic thinker, Uwe Reinhardt.
 
For nearly 50 years, the late Uwe Reinhardt was a beloved economist and professor at Princeton University. Known best for helping to shape critical discourse around healthcare markets, his biting wit and intellect challenged students, colleagues, and policymakers alike to follow the data and to check all assumptions at the door.
 
INET also thanks Rethinking Economics for their voices and contributions.
