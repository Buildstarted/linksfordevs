			<p>On July 8, 2020, we discovered unusual activity on one of our servers. We immediately initiated an investigation, notified law enforcement and engaged a leading independent forensics firm to help. Through this investigation, we learned that it is possible that an unauthorized party may have accessed the email addresses used by our users on their Zello accounts and a hashed version of their passwords.</p>
<p>We have no evidence that any accounts have been improperly accessed. Additionally, it is important to note that Zello access requires both a username and password, and usernames were not impacted by this incident. Though email addresses were impacted, users rarely use emails as Zello usernames. As a security precaution, we are asking all users to reset their Zello app passwords. We also recommend that users change passwords for any other online services where they may have used the same password.</p>
<p>Zello Work and Zello for First Responders customers are not affected by this incident.</p>
<p>Your data security and privacy are a top priority, and we apologize for this inconvenience. We continue to invest in people, processes and technology to enhance our company’s data security and to help prevent a similar incident from occurring again.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>Why do I need to change my password?</h3>
<p>Though Zello access requires both a username and password, and usernames were not impacted by this incident, we are asking all users to please reset their Zello app passwords as a security precaution. We also recommend that users change passwords for any other online services where they may have used the same password.</p>
<h3>How do I change my password?</h3>
<p>To change your password, follow the instructions provided on <a href="https://support.zello.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046653612" target="_self">this page</a>.</p>
<h3>Was my account accessed?</h3>
<p>We have no evidence that any accounts have been improperly accessed. Additionally, it is important to note that Zello access requires both a username and password, and usernames were not impacted by this incident. Though email addresses were impacted, they are rarely used as Zello usernames or passwords.</p>
<h3>Is my financial information impacted?</h3>
<p>No. The app is free and Zello does not store financial information.</p>
<h3>What if I don’t remember my password?</h3>
<p>You can reset your password by following <a href="https://support.zello.com/hc/en-us/articles/230748647" target="_self">these instructions</a>.</p>
<h3>I use my Zello password for several other websites/apps/accounts. What should I do?</h3>
<p>Your password was not in plain text, but in a coded format generated through a cryptographic process known as “hashing”, which is designed to make your password unreadable. As a precaution, however, you should change your password for any other online services where you may have used the same password. It is also important to choose a strong password that is not easy to guess.</p>
