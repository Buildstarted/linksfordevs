This is especially popular among flight- and hotel booking services. It’s probably implemented to encourage you to buy the product as quickly as possible, out of fear that someone else will snag it before you.</p><p id="e4c6" data-selectable-paragraph="">Sometimes, this number is legit. Other times, it’s random. Really random.</p><p id="9c15" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s look at a shop called <a href="https://dafnihair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dafni</a>. If you don’t know what Dafni is, don’t worry: neither do I. The two things I do know about them is that 1) they sell products, and 2) they lie about how many people are currently viewing their products. Do note that this article is not meant as an attack on this e-commerce in particular, as what you’re about to see isn’t too uncommon of a trick, but it is rarely as apparent as it is here. This e-commerce is a perfect example of how online stores may try to trick their customers.</p><p id="2ab4" data-selectable-paragraph="">Upon entering <a href="https://dafnihair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">their website</a>, I selected the first product I could find on the front page, which in my case happened to be <a href="https://dafnihair.com/dafni-allure/#product-section" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this product</a>:</p></div></div><div><div><p id="5b51" data-selectable-paragraph="">I know you’re probably distracted by the fact that it says, in bold, uppercase letters: “Innovation at it’s finest,” rather than the grammatically correct “its,” but I want you to look at the piece of text that reads: “14 people are currently looking at this product.”</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*oSjFdK2aA0tZ2Xp1Np8FpQ.png?q=20" width="670" height="85" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="670" height="85" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*oSjFdK2aA0tZ2Xp1Np8FpQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*oSjFdK2aA0tZ2Xp1Np8FpQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*oSjFdK2aA0tZ2Xp1Np8FpQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1340/1*oSjFdK2aA0tZ2Xp1Np8FpQ.png 670w" sizes="670px" role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/670/1*oSjFdK2aA0tZ2Xp1Np8FpQ.png"></p></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">Screenshot from <a href="https://dafnihair.com/dafni-allure/#product-section" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dafnihair.com</a> taken on 2020–06–11.</figcaption></figure><p id="e8a5" data-selectable-paragraph="">While you can’t tell from a still image, this number stood out for me as it changed drastically every few seconds. I decided to take a look at the source code to examine what method they use to update the number.</p><p id="ae2d" data-selectable-paragraph="">In case you’re not aware, in order for developers to update elements on a website after it has first been loaded, they generally have to use a client-side language. These languages are run in your web browser, and as such, you can view it yourself. By simply right-clicking just about anywhere on a page and selecting something akin to “View source,” you can examine what code is being run to update elements such as the number of people currently viewing products.</p><p id="f7b5" data-selectable-paragraph="">In this particular e-commerce, I found this code:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*w-jUd7vAY0ocRlg7D2XFDQ.png?q=20" width="1241" height="500" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="1241" height="500" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*w-jUd7vAY0ocRlg7D2XFDQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*w-jUd7vAY0ocRlg7D2XFDQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*w-jUd7vAY0ocRlg7D2XFDQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*w-jUd7vAY0ocRlg7D2XFDQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">A method found in the source code for <a href="https://dafnihair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dafnihair.com</a>. The image itself was made by the author.</figcaption></figure><p id="a3d9" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is an exact copy of the code. Yes, it says “prodiutc” in the source code. But more interestingly, this code clearly shows that the number of people presented as viewing the product is blatantly random.</p><p id="aac8" data-selectable-paragraph="">I translated the code into human language:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*aXnY3j41mO3AShqSGiYgBA.png?q=20" width="1241" height="500" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="1241" height="500" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*aXnY3j41mO3AShqSGiYgBA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*aXnY3j41mO3AShqSGiYgBA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*aXnY3j41mO3AShqSGiYgBA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*aXnY3j41mO3AShqSGiYgBA.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">The Javascript code translated into human language. The image is made by the author.</figcaption></figure><p id="9c90" data-selectable-paragraph="">The number of people viewing the article is thus a complete fabrication. The code simply generates a random number every five seconds. This makes it appear as though people are constantly browsing the website, making it seem lively and busy. It’s probably supposed to make the website look more trustworthy, as many other people appear to be browsing. It can also encourage customers to checkout as quickly as possible, as the product they are interested in might be in high demand.</p><p id="745b" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the event that you are reading this in the far future and the website has since been updated, you might be happy to know that the website was indexed by the web archives crawlers on May 16th, 2020 — and this code is saved in it. You can find an indexed version of the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191230031401/https://dafnihair.com/dafni-allure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p id="f7b1" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you find something similar when you’re out exploring the world <em>wild</em> web, don’t be afraid to view the source code and see if you can find something fishy lurking beneath the interface.</p><p id="89ed" data-selectable-paragraph="">Website owners may lie, but the code never does.</p></div></div></div></div>
