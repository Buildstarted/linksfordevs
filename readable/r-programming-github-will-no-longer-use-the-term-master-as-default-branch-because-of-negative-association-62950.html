<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-test-id="comment"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>Well GitHub and GitLab seem to be moving ahead with this anyway. All my clients and all companies I've worked for are American, but I'm not American, and though I visit several times a year (well not this year) I don't live there. Maybe this is why this stuff doesn't even register with me.</p><p>What I find fascinating is that by removing history, even bad history, we are essentially dooming ourselves to forget it. Listen, what will happen in a 100 years when there are no books, no statues, NO WORDS, to indicate how horrible slavery was during certain periods of time in MANY parts of the world? There's a world of difference between romanticizing such horrible things and just removing them from the history books altogether.</p><p>And yes, before anyone says "we are not trying to rewrite history", for fuck's sake, you are literally taking a WORD from a technical definition because as of today, it's a politically incorrect world.</p><p>I can't decide if this is just corporate pandering, a bunch of extremely privileged people trying to show the rest of the world "Hey! Look at me! We are doing something! Checkout is this way btw." or just collective, 1984 style mass hysteria.</p><p>And the worst part is, imagine being someone who still live in horrible conditions today: sex trafficking around the world, literal slave markets in Libya, slave labor in many parts of the "third world", then seeing this meaningless acts of masturbation that do NOTHING about them. How the fuck are they going to feel?</p><p>"It's a beautiful thing. The destruction of words".</p></div></div></div></div>
