I've been working on this project for months and I'm happy to announce <a href="http://dot.net/videos">http://dot.net/videos</a>&nbsp;</p><p>There's nearly a hundred short videos (with more to come!) that will teach you topics like C# 101, .NET, making desktop apps, making ASP.NET web apps, learning containers and Dockers, or even starting with Machine Learning. There's a ton of great, slow-paced beginner videos. Most are less than 10 minutes long and all are organized into Playlists on YouTube! </p><p>If you are getting started, I'd recommend starting with these three series in this order - C#, .NET, then ASP.NET. After that, pick the topics that make you the happiest.</p><figure><a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/videos"><img title="Lots of .NET learning videos and tutorials up on YouTube, free!" border="0" alt="Lots of .NET learning videos and tutorials up on YouTube, free!" src="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Announcin.NET-for-beginners-video-course_1203A/image_8b0b76f8-5a24-4f84-94ec-45fa0fcd0915.png" width="1001" height="316"></a></figure><p>If you don't have access to YouTube where you are, all these videos are also on Channel 9 *and* can be downloaded locally via RSS feed! <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Browse/Series">https://channel9.msdn.com/Browse/Series</a></p><figure><a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/videos"><img title="Lots of .NET learning videos and tutorials up on YouTube, free!" border="0" alt="Lots of .NET learning videos and tutorials up on YouTube, free!" src="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Announcin.NET-for-beginners-video-course_1203A/image_278768f9-fe43-42e8-89ae-6c6330042996.png" width="1001" height="297"></a></figure><p>If you like these, let me know what other topics you'd like us to cover!
