<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The knee-jerk response to observations like these is, “If life is so
bad, why don’t you just kill yourself?” Benatar devotes a
forty-three-page chapter to proving that death only exacerbates our
problems. “Life is bad, but so is death,” he concludes. “Of course, life
is not bad in <em>every</em> way. Neither is death bad in every way. However,
both life and death are, in crucial respects, awful. Together, they
constitute an existential vise—the wretched grip that enforces our
predicament.” It’s better, he argues, not to enter into the predicament
in the first place. People sometimes ask themselves whether life is
worth living. Benatar thinks that it’s better to ask sub-questions: Is
life worth continuing? (Yes, because death is bad.) Is life worth
starting? (No.)</p><p>Benatar is far from the only anti-natalist. Books such as Sarah Perry’s
“<a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Every-Cradle-Grave-Rethinking-Suicide/dp/0989697290&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Every-Cradle-Grave-Rethinking-Suicide/dp/0989697290" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-amzn-asin="0989697290">Every Cradle Is a
Grave</a>”
and Thomas Ligotti’s “<a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Conspiracy-against-Human-Race-Contrivance/dp/0984480277&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Conspiracy-against-Human-Race-Contrivance/dp/0984480277" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-amzn-asin="0984480277">The Conspiracy Against the Human
Race</a>”
have also found audiences. There are many “misanthropic anti-natalists”:
the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, for example, has thousands of
members who believe that, for environmental reasons, human beings should
cease to exist. For misanthropic anti-natalists, the problem isn’t
life—it’s us. Benatar, by contrast, is a “compassionate anti-natalist.”
His thinking parallels that of the philosopher Thomas Metzinger, who
studies consciousness and artificial intelligence; Metzinger espouses
digital anti-natalism, arguing that it would be wrong to create
artificially conscious computer programs because doing so would increase
the amount of suffering in the world. The same argument could apply to
human beings.</p><p>Like a boxer who has practiced his counters, Benatar has anticipated a
range of objections. Many people suggest that the best experiences in
life—love, beauty, discovery, and so on—make up for the bad ones. To
this, Benatar replies that pain is worse than pleasure is good. Pain
lasts longer: “There’s such a thing as chronic pain, but there’s no such
thing as chronic pleasure,” he said. It’s also more powerful: would you
trade five minutes of the worst pain imaginable for five minutes of the
greatest pleasure? Moreover, there’s an abstract sense in which missing
out on good experiences isn’t as bad as having bad ones. “For an
existing person, the presence of bad things is bad and the presence of
good things is good,” Benatar explained. “But compare that with a
scenario in which that person never existed—then, the absence of the bad
would be good, but the absence of the good wouldn’t be bad, because
there’d be nobody to be deprived of those good things.” This asymmetry
“completely stacks the deck against existence,” he continued, because it
suggests that “all the unpleasantness and all the misery and all the
suffering could be over, without any real cost.”</p><p>Some people argue that talk of pain and pleasure misses the point: even
if life isn’t good, it’s meaningful. Benatar replies that, in fact,
human life is cosmically meaningless: we exist in an indifferent
universe, perhaps even a “multiverse,” and are subject to blind and
purposeless natural forces. In the absence of cosmic meaning, only
“terrestrial” meaning remains—and, he writes, there’s “something
circular about arguing that the purpose of humanity’s existence is that
individual humans should help one another.” Benatar also rejects the
argument that struggle and suffering, in themselves, can lend meaning to
existence. “I don’t believe that suffering gives meaning,” Benatar said.
“I think that people try to find meaning in suffering because the
suffering is otherwise so gratuitous and unbearable.” It’s true, he
said, that “Nelson Mandela generated meaning through the way he
responded to suffering—but that’s not to defend the conditions in which
he lived.”</p><p>I asked Benatar why the proper response to his arguments wasn’t to
strive to make the world a better place. The possible creation of a
better world in the future, he told me, hardly justifies the suffering
of people in the present; at any rate, a dramatically improved world is
impossible. “It’ll never happen. The lessons never seem to get learnt.
They never seem to get learnt. Maybe the odd individual will learn them,
but you still see this madness around you,” he said. “You can say, ‘For
goodness’ sake! Can’t you see how you’re making the same mistakes humans
have made before? Can’t we do this differently?’ But it doesn’t happen.”
Ultimately, he said, “unpleasantness and suffering are too deeply
written into the structure of sentient life to be eliminated.” His voice
grew more urgent; his eyes teared up. “We’re asked to accept what is
unacceptable. It’s unacceptable that people, and other beings, have to
go through what they go through, and there’s almost nothing that they
can do about it.” In an ordinary conversation, I would’ve murmured
something reassuring. In this case, I didn’t know what to say.</p><p>Benatar had selected a vegan restaurant for lunch, and we set out to
walk there, along the Hudson. At the end of Vesey Street, we passed the
Irish Hunger Memorial—a quarter acre of soil transplanted from Ireland,
in 2001, to commemorate the millions who had died during the country’s
Great Famine. At Benatar’s suggestion, we spent a few minutes exploring
and reading the historical quotes displayed in the entryway. The famine
lasted seven years; recalling it, one man wrote, “It dwells in my memory
as one long night of sorrow.”</p><p>It was a warm day. In Battery Park, mothers picnicked with their small
children on the grass. A group of co-workers played table tennis. Down by
the water, couples strolled hand in hand. There were runners on the
path—shirtless men with muscular chests, women in stylish workout gear.</p><p>“Do you ever feel a dissonance between your beliefs and your
environment?” I asked.</p><p>“I’m not opposed to people having fun, or in denial that life contains
good things,” Benatar said, laughing. I glanced over to see that he had
removed his sweater and was now in shirtsleeves. His cap appeared not to
have moved. We reached the spot where, eight weeks later, a
twenty-nine-year-old man in a van <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/terror-in-lower-manhattan">would
kill</a> eight people and injure eleven others.</p><p>Like everyone else, Benatar finds his views disturbing; he has,
therefore, ambivalent feelings about sharing them. He wouldn’t walk into
a church, stride to the pulpit, and declare that God doesn’t exist.
Similarly, he doesn’t relish the idea of becoming an ambassador for
anti-natalism. Life, he says, is already unpleasant enough. He reassures
himself that, because his books are philosophical and academic, they
will be read only by those who seek them out. He hears from readers who
are grateful to find their own secret thoughts expressed. One man with
several children read “Better Never to Have Been,” then told Benatar
that he believed having them had been a terrible mistake; people
suffering from terrible mental and physical afflictions write to say
they wish that they had never existed. He also hears from people who
share his views and are disabled by them. “I’m just filled with sadness
for people like that,” he said, in a soft voice. “They have an accurate
view of reality, and they’re paying the price for it.” I asked Benatar
whether he ever found his own thoughts overwhelming. He smiled
uncomfortably—another personal question—and said, “Writing helps.”</p><p>He doesn’t imagine that anti-natalism could ever be widely adopted: “It
runs counter to too many biological drives.” Still, for him, it’s a
source of hope. “The madness of the world as a whole—what can you or I
do about that?” he said, while we walked. “But every couple, or every
person, can decide not to have a child. That’s an immense amount of
suffering that’s avoided, which is all to the good.” When friends have
children, he must watch his words. “I’m torn,” he said. Having a child
is “pretty horrible, given the predicament in which it will find
itself”; on the other hand, “optimism makes life more bearable.” Some
years ago, when a fellow-philosopher told him that she was pregnant, his
response was muted. Come on, she insisted—you <em>have</em> to be happy for me.
Benatar consulted his conscience, then said, “I am happy—for <em>you</em>.”</p><p>At lunch, we sat next to a little girl and her mother. The girl was
around eight years old, wearing a dress and holding a book. “Do you want
to take these home?” her mother asked, pointing to some French fries.</p><p>“Yes!” the girl said.</p><p>My conversation with Benatar continued, but I found it hard to talk
about anti-natalism while sitting next to the mother and daughter. We
spent much of our lunch amiably discussing our work habits. On the
street, we shook hands. “I’m just going to walk around a bit,” Benatar
said. He planned to wander the West Village before heading to the airport. I walked south and, near the World Trade Center,
descended into the Oculus, the vast, sepulchral mall and train station
that has replaced the one destroyed in the 9/11 attacks. With its
towering, spine-like roof and white-marble ribs, it is part skeleton,
part cathedral. Standing on the escalator, I watched as a woman with one
arm in her jacket struggled to insert the other. An overweight
businessman, his ears plugged with earbuds, brushed past me, jostling me
with his briefcase. As he reached the bottom, he held the woman’s coat,
and she slipped into it.</p></div></div></div>
