<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong><em>tl;dr ‚Äì To fully deprecate an extension method when you need to maintain binary compatibility (e.g. plugins), especially if it‚Äôs colliding with another extension method, you can simply remove the ‚Äòthis‚Äô keyword.</em></strong></p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">I recently needed to remove a duplicate extension method from the Paint.NET code base. I had two copies of a <strong>ServiceProviderExtensions</strong> class, one in the <strong>PaintDotNet</strong> namespace and the other in <strong>PaintDotNet.AppModel</strong> (which I wanted to remove). They both had a <strong>GetService&lt;TService&gt;</strong>() extension method:</p>



<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D-pKgQlUcAABGQp.jpg:large" alt=""></figure>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">The second copy was just an absent-minded addition at some point, but of course ‚Ä¶ some plugins started using the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù one (there‚Äôs no way the plugin authors could‚Äôve known). Worse, if you had a <strong>using</strong> at the top of your C# code file for both namespaces, whether inside the app or out in a plugin, you couldn‚Äôt use <em>either</em> of the extension methods because the compiler would give you a ‚ÄúThe call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties‚Äù error.</p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">Hrumph! So, clearly I wanted to delete one of these. But, how could I do that without breaking plugins? Some were using the first copy, others were using the second copy!</p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">The first solution I came up with was to create a new DLL, let‚Äôs call it <strong>PaintDotNet.Obsolete.dll</strong>. I‚Äôd then move the ‚Äúbad‚Äù extension method class into there, add an <strong>[assembly: TypeForwardedTo(‚Ä¶)]</strong> attribute in the original DLL, and add <strong>[Obsolete]</strong> onto the methods in the new (err, obsolete) DLL. I couldn‚Äôt add <strong>[Obsolete]</strong> to the class, however, otherwise the <strong>TypeForwardedTo</strong> attribute would get flagged with an error too. This would mostly work, but was messy and clumsy. I may still need to use this idea in the future to cover other deprecation scenarios.</p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">Finally, it dawned on me: what if I just removed ‚Äòthis‚Äô from the extension method signature? This would remove it from IntelliSense, and also remove it as a candidate for extension method resolution <em>at compile time</em>, while still affording binary compatibility with old plugin DLLs.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D-pMlyuU0AAnI_Q.jpg:large" alt=""></figure>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">And ‚Ä¶ it worked!!!</p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">It works because extension methods and ‚Äòthis‚Äô are implemented in the <em>compiler </em>as syntactic sugar. It‚Äôs neither a runtime nor a framework feature; once your DLL is compiled, extension methods don‚Äôt really exist (at least at the call site).</p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">The ‚Äòthis‚Äô keyword turns into an attribute on the method which identifies it as an extension method. When compiling a DLL that consumes the extension method, the code that‚Äôs emitted is a normal static method call. Since I wasn‚Äôt removing the static method, the old plugin DLLs would still be able to use it.</p>



<p data-adtags-visited="true">And thus a years-old conundrum has been solved. Old plugins will continue to work, and new plugins (and new app code!) can use the right extension method without the ambiguity error.</p>
