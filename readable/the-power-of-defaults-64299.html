        <p>I use every ounce of willpower to keep still. One wrong move might wreak
havoc. After carefully assessing the situation, I move my mouse over the
right option, select it, and press ‘Next’. Crisis narrowly averted, I am
now confronting the next set of inane settings—until finally, this
installation of Windows&nbsp;10 is finished. Midway along the process, I
ask myself whether the designers of the setup process are aware that the
majority of users will probably select the defaults, thus making it easy
for Microsoft to use extra diagnostic data, install additional software,
and decrease the user’s privacy even further. Welcome to 2020!</p>
<p>While setting up my dad’s new computer, I had a lot of time to speculate
on the choices that designers make when creating an installation script.
It dawned on me at some point that <em>we</em>, i.e. researchers that develop a
software package in addition to their research, are doing <em>precisely</em> the
same thing. We create a software tool for solving a certain problem. It
might be an itch that we want to scratch, or it might be software that
is related to our research—in the end, we all write some code in
some language to produce some kind of value. How often do we think about
the dangers of the API that we are exposing, though?</p>

<p>I am not talking about the dangers of our programs turning rogue and
trying to take over the world<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I am talking about us providing
potentially misleading parameters to our users. Take
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/"><code>scikit-learn</code></a> as an example<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. This
package, arguably the default for many data science applications, offers
a wealth of classifiers, metrics, and utility classes to train models.
I want to focus on the
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html"><code>LogisticRegression</code></a>
class in particular. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">Logistic regression</a> is
a classifier that extends linear regression to the <em>prediction</em> setting:
given data and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable">categorical labels</a>, logistic
regression trains a model based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic functions</a>. With
a trained classifier, we can predict the label of ‘unseen’ data points
later on. So far, so good—this is the daily bread of many researchers,
data scientists, and data analysts. The implementation of logistic
regression in <code>scikit-learn</code> is comprehensive and offers numerous
additional configuration options to tweak the model.</p>

<p>Its default parameters, however, are <em>dangerous</em>. Specifically, by
default, the model is subject to <span id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><msub><mi>L</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>" role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>L</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math></span></span> regularisation with a default
regularisation strength of <code>C = 1.0</code>.  A little background might be
required to see just <em>why</em> this might be dangerous. In machine
learning<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)">regularisation</a>
refers to adding additional constraints on a classifier to ensure that
the classifier does not suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">overfitting</a>.
Put somewhat differently, regularisation slightly changes the model that
is fit in order to improve generalisation performance. This is because, when creating
a classifier, we do not want a model to learn the data ‘by heart’, but
rather, we want it to perform well on <em>new</em> data points. A classical
regularisation technique is <span id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><msub><mi>L</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>" role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>L</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math></span></span> regularisation, which adds an
additional penalty—the <em>squared Euclidean norm</em>
of the weight vector—in order to make fitting the model harder, thus
<em>increasing</em> its bias and preventing overfitting<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If regularisation appears to be desired, why is this problematic?
I would argue that the choice of regularisation is inherently a choice
that the <em>user</em> should make. By default, logistic regression is not
regularised at all—it is not part of the model specification. Thus,
unless your classifier or model was proven to perform best with
a specific regularisation technique, it is outright dangerous to enable
regularisation by default. In the worst case, it might trick users into
believing that they did <em>not</em> employ regularisation when in fact they
did: when comparing to other methods in a publication, it is common
practice to report the parameters that one selected for a classifier.
A somewhat hidden assumption on the model can be very problematic for
the reproducibility of a paper. This issue was discussed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/zacharylipton/status/1167298276686589953?s=20">Tweet by
Zachary Lipton</a>,
and I would definitely encourage reading this discussion thread.</p>

<p>A natural reaction to such a discussion is to play the ‘blame game’.
I fully agree that uses should read the documentation of the software
that they are about to use<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Nevertheless, I would say that it is <em>our</em>
responsibility as developers to think about these cases and try to
develop a safe API. In the case of logistic regression, there is
a simple fix:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the default behaviour for regularisation.</li>
<li>Create a new class <code>RegularisedLogisticRegression</code> that implements
<em>some</em> form regularisation by default.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is less problematic because the name of such a class will make it
clear to users what is going on, whereas the current class name is
still&nbsp;(slightly) misleading. Of course, such choices should <em>not</em>
lead to the overreaction of abandoning all defaults in software. On the
contrary! Defaults are useful because they keep our interface clean and
make it possible to ‘just try out’ our software. From the perspective of
a user, setting up a tool such that it does ‘the right thing’, is
a blessing—and judging from my personal usage patterns, having
‘sensible defaults’ also increases the likelihood of people using your
software.</p>

<p>The practical implementation of this policy is not always easy, though.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least astonishment</a>,
also known as the ‘principle of least surprise’, refers to a design
philosophy that tries to <em>reduce</em> the astonishment of users when it
comes to the behaviour of the system. For example, when using
<code>numpy.sum</code> without any parameters, it takes the sum over the whole
array. This makes sense because there is no ‘default axis’ on which
all users can agree—some would probably prefer sums over the rows,
while others would prefer sums over the columns. The implementation
sidesteps this issue by <em>forcing</em> the user to make a choice in case
the default does not do the expected thing.</p>
<p>Given that more complex algorithms exist for which these defaults are
not clear, what can we do? I would suggest the following strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide example code that sets all parameters required for using
a tool, even those that are set by default to some value. Not only
does this ensure reproducibility to some extent, it also gives the
user a notion of how complex our tool is, and which things to keep
in mind when employing it.</li>
<li>Keep the number of default parameters small and restrict them to a
set of safe values. For example, when your algorithm can use an
approximation scheme that speeds up the computations at the cost of
accuracy, it should <em>not</em> be enabled by default. However, if your
algorithm can either perform calculations ‘bottom-up’ or ‘top-down’,
with certain computational advantages in some situations, any one of
these could be set by default, as long as it does not affect the
results.</li>
<li>Realise that different users have different expectations. Be prepared
to compromise and adjust your tools accordingly. Try to warn uses
whenever they are about to wager into dangerous territories.</li>
</ol>
<p>May your defaults be safe and unsurprising, until next time!</p>
