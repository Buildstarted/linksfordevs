For multi-tasking and organization, the most we can do is tabbed browsing. <strong class="gs he">Immersive headsets enable us to break out of the screen </strong>and design computing applications the way humans think: spatially. With Bigscreen, you can have a browser in front of you, Netflix on the wall, and a Spotify music player floating to your side.</p><p id="8738" class="gq gr ef at gs b gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd dx">Secondly, VR enables us to immerse ourselves in virtual worlds that feels like a real, physical space. Our cinema environment features a 110-foot screen and realistic lighting that makes us <em class="ik">feel</em> like we’re watching movies in an actual movie theater.</p><figure class="ip iq ir is it iu do dp paragraph-image"><figcaption class="ax fi jl jm hn dq do dp jn jo as cx">The Bigscreen “Cinema” has a 110-foot screen &amp; realistic real-time lighting</figcaption></figure><p id="8faa" class="gq gr ef at gs b gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd dx">VR is also powerful for <strong class="gs he">collaborative and social applications</strong>. 2D videoconferencing limits natural communication, gesturing, and eye contact. Using Bigscreen with VR hand controllers, users can convey more body language than with just a webcam, and effortlessly communicate ideas.</p><figure class="ip iq ir is it iu do dp paragraph-image"><figcaption class="ax fi jl jm hn dq do dp jn jo as cx">Two people using VR headsets and <a href="http://bigscreenvr.com" class="dc by hf hg hh hi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bigscreen</a> to collaborate on 3D modeling in Autodesk™ Maya™</figcaption></figure><p id="1c55" class="gq gr ef at gs b gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd dx">Although VR may appear like a “silly, expensive toy for gamers” today, <strong class="gs he">VR/AR is the next computing medium</strong>. In the next decade, VR/AR devices will be lightweight, affordable, stylish glasses. Eventually, all of our day-to-day computing activities–web browsing, word processing, movie watching, and gaming–will occur inside immersive VR/AR headsets.</p><blockquote class="il im in"><p id="1f6a" class="gq gr ef ik gs b gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd dx"><strong class="gs he"><em class="at">To put it differently, Bigscreen is creating the virtual version of real-world movie theaters, living rooms, lounges, and workspaces.</em></strong></p></blockquote><h1 id="d1c7" class="ht hu ef at as hv eh jr ej js hy jt ia ju ic jv ie">Use Cases of Bigscreen</h1><p id="1d68" class="gq gr ef at gs b gt if gv ig gx ih gz ii hb ij hd dx">People use Bigscreen in 3 ways: public multiplayer (Internet friends), private multiplayer (friends), and singleplayer (60% use Bigscreen solo).<strong class="gs he"> The most popular use case of Bigscreen is to watch videos in a virtual reality cinema</strong>. This enables people to relax in the comfort of their own home, while feeling like they’re watching Netflix or Game of Thrones in a IMAX-like theater. Some ways people used Bigscreen surprised us:</p><ul class=""><li id="380b" class="gq gr ef at gs b gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd jw jx jy">Couples in long-distance relationships use Bigscreen for “virtual date night” to <strong class="gs he">relax and watch a movie togethe</strong>r in our virtual reality cinema.</li><li id="4a8b" class="gq gr ef at gs b gt jz gv ka gx kb gz kc hb kd hd jw jx jy">College students are using Bigscreen to <strong class="gs he">focus and study</strong> in a distraction-free and serene virtual environment, unlike their cramped dorm room.</li><li id="f416" class="gq gr ef at gs b gt jz gv ka gx kb gz kc hb kd hd jw jx jy">College students are virtually hanging out and playing video games with old high school friends living on the other side of the country.</li><li id="d70f" class="gq gr ef at gs b gt jz gv ka gx kb gz kc hb kd hd jw jx jy">Gamers love using Bigscreen to play their favorite (non-VR) PC videogames on massive screens. Bigscreen also enables VR “<a href="https://uploadvr.com/bigscreen-lan-party-rocket-league/" class="dc by hf hg hh hi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LAN parties</a>” for gamers to <strong class="gs he">hangout with friends and play videogames together</strong>.</li></ul><blockquote class="il im in"><p id="e1d8" class="gq gr ef ik gs b gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb hc hd dx"><strong class="gs he">Remarkably, people are using the Bigscreen VR platform for mainstream use cases such as movie watching, gaming, collaboration, and productivity.</strong></p></blockquote></div></div></div></div>
