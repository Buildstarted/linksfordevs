<p>Quantum mechanics is the most successful and fundamental physical theory ever devised by human beings. Yes, in the famous words of Richard Feynman, "I think I can safely say that nobody really understands quantum mechanics."</p>
<p>Physicists should be outraged by our lack of understanding, and devote extraordinary resources and brainpower to figuring out what quantum mechanics really is and what it implies about the world. Instead, for many decades we have refused to take the problem seriously, choosing instead to "Shut up and calculate!" Calculating is always good, but it's time to speak up and do some hard thinking.</p>
<p><em>Something Deeply Hidden</em> aims to demystify quantum mechanics, insisting that it's just as sensible and intelligible as any other physical theory. The best way we currently have to make sense of quantum phenomena -- always subject to change if new data come in, of course -- is the Many-Worlds formulation, put forward by Hugh Everett in the 1950's.</p>
<p>Many-Worlds isn't a baroque addition to a simple formalism; it is the simplest possible formalism to make sense of the data we've collected, but it has far-reaching and mind-stretching implications for how we think about ourselves and our place in reality. Among these implications are straightforward lessons for how we should tackle other looming questions in physics, most obviously the long-standing issue of reconciling quantum mechanics with general relativity, Einstein's theory of spacetime and gravity.</p>
<p><em>Something Deeply Hidden</em> will convince you that understanding quantum mechanics is a crucially important and entirely attainable goal. It delves into the details of Many-Worlds in a way never before done in a book for the general reader. And it will introduce cutting-edge ideas in quantum gravity, showing how curved spacetime might have been lurking in the quantum wave function all along.</p>
