As part of that, it's <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/d-link-camera-poses-data-security-risk--consumer-reports-finds/">reviewing</a> wireless home-security cameras.</p><p>It found significant security vulnerabilities in D-Link cameras:</p><blockquote><p>In contrast, D-Link doesn't store video from the DCS-2630L in the cloud. Instead, the camera has its own, onboard web server, which can deliver video to the user in different ways.

</p><p>Users can view the video using an app, mydlink Lite. The video is encrypted, and it travels from the camera through D-Link's corporate servers, and ultimately to the user's phone. Users can also access the same encrypted video feed through a company web page, <a href="https://www.mydlink.com/entrance">mydlink.com</a>. Those are both secure methods of accessing the video.</p><p>But the D-Link camera also lets you bypass the D-Link corporate servers and access the video directly through a web browser on a laptop or other device. If you do this, the web server on the camera doesn't encrypt the video.</p><p>If you set up this kind of remote access, the camera and unencrypted video is open to the web. They could be discovered by anyone who finds or guesses the camera's IP address­ -- and if you haven't set a strong password, a hacker might find it easy to gain access.</p></blockquote><p>The real news is that <i>Consumer Reports</i> is able to put pressure on device manufacturers:</p><blockquote><p>In response to a Consumer Reports query, D-Link said that security would be tightened through <a href="https://support.dlink.com/">updates this fall</a>. Consumer Reports will evaluate those updates once they are available. </p></blockquote><p>This is the sort of sustained pressure we need on IoT device manufacturers.</p><p>Boing Boing <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/10/30/d-link-dcs-2630l.html">link</a>. </p><p>EDITED TO ADD (11/13): In related news, the US Federal Trade Commission is <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/06/dlink_ftc_denied/">suing</a> D-Link because their routers are so insecure.
