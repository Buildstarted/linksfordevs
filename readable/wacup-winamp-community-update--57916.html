<p>WACUP (which can be pronounced as <i>wakeup</i> or <i>wac-up</i> or however you prefer it in your native tongue) is designed to work only with the patched Winamp 5.666 release to provide bug fixes, updates of existing features and most importantly new features with the goal to eventually become it's own highly Winamp compatible media player.</p>
<p>WACUP makes use of the benefits of Winamp being heavily based on a plug-in system so new plug-ins can add additional features as well as allowing replacements to be created which provide better implementations over the plug-ins natively included with Winamp.</p>
<p>If none of that makes sense, a good way to think about WACUP is that it is like a video game mod where you initially use the original game but then files related to it are added to or edited in-order to provide a better experience.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<hr>
<h2 id="download">Where can I get it ?</h2>
<p>WACUP is still under development but a fully functioning Preview build can be <a href="https://getwacup.com/preview/"><b>downloaded here</b></a>. As this is pre-release software there can be issues which can be reported in the <a href="https://getwacup.com/community/index.php/board,10.0.html"><b>preview discussion forum</b></a>. We recommend installing this WACUP Preview build into a seperate directory from your existing Winamp install until it is feature complete.</p>
<p>The latest available beta to download for the registered beta testers is build <b><a href="https://getwacup.com/changelog/beta_1_0_9_5050.html">#5050 (February 12th 2020)</a></b>. If you want to help with beta testing <a href="https://getwacup.com/#beta">see below</a> for how to get involved.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="support">Will it be free ?</h2>
<p>Yes WACUP will be free to download and to use.</p>
<p>However as this is an independent project to do something to keep Winamp alive and whippin' as well as due to the amount of time and effort which is involved, I am accepting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=E36G8TPFDMM3W"><b>donations</b></a> (and other means of <a href="https://getwacup.com/support/"><b>support</b></a>) to help cover my living costs whilst I'm working on getting this developed and released. As at this time, this is a full-time project for me whilst I see where the future will take me and this project.</p>
<p id="beta">There are additional methods for helping to <a href="https://getwacup.com/support/"><b>support</b></a> this project be it financially or otherwise.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Can I help beta test ?</h2>
<p>Before WACUP is publcially released, it is planned to have a number of beta releases to ensure that things work correctly and do not cause any issues (especially with any of the new plug-ins being used to replace the native Winamp plug-ins).</p>
<p>To be considered for helping test the beta releases, please create an account on the <a href="https://getwacup.com/community/"><b>community forum</b></a> and send a PM to '<b>dro</b>' along with any information you think is helpful. <b>Please Note:</b> Requests to be a beta tester are processed in batches typically when new beta builds are released so please by patient of this process.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> <u>Windows 7</u> and <u>Windows 10</u> users would be the most helpful. Windows 8.x isn't something I'm too keen on testing against as Windows 10 pretty much is the route to go. Also Windows XP is not going to be supported despite Winamp being able to run on it due to the end of life of that version of Windows and the extra overhead supporting it introduces on development time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="develop">How to follow development ?</h2>
<p>Development of WACUP can be followed via my (typically) <a href="https://getwacup.com/blog/index.php/category/development-updates/">weekly blog updates</a> as well as with any other <a href="https://getwacup.com/blog/">blog posts</a> that are made.</p><p>There are also the build specific <a href="https://getwacup.com/changelog/">changelogs</a> which are freely provided for all to see what has changed in the beta and public releases.</p><p>Additionally there is a <a href="https://getwacup.com/development.html">development changelog</a> that is being updated when features / fixes are completed and is provided as a means to see what is going to present in the next (or rather first) non-beta release.</p>

I also worked on SHOUTcast since late 2010 until mid-September 2015.</p>
