</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Reading blog posts accounts for a great deal of my reading and learning about technology. Combined with videos from conferences, I feel like I'm up to date on new things being launched. But when I need to dig deep into a subject, I never get around reading books. In this post, I'll present you with a list of books that I've read or got recommended from developer friends.</p><figure><a href="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/top-10-books-every-dot-net-c-developer-should-read.png" data-fancybox=""><img src="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/top-10-books-every-dot-net-c-developer-should-read.png"></a></figure><p>Let me start by making something clear: I suck at reading books. Some of my friends read one book after another, while I only read technical literature when I need to go deep on something. If you are like me, this is a distilled list of some of the most recommended books. If you just love reading about technology, I hope that you will find something of value too. The list is not prioritized so feel free to pick only subjects or authors you like.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
    <p><a href="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/csharp-in-depth-2.png" data-fancybox=""><img src="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/csharp-in-depth-2.png"></a></p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/c-sharp-in-depth-fourth-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h2>C# in Depth</h2></a>
    <p>This is probably the one most people have suggested me to read. Written by Jon Skeet himself, it should be on everyone's radar. I know that we are on C# version 8 now, but there is plenty to look at in this book.</p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
    <p><a href="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/csharp-7-in-a-nutshell.png" data-fancybox=""><img src="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/csharp-7-in-a-nutshell.png"></a></p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920083634.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h2>C# 7.0 in a Nutshell</h2></a>
    <p>While C# in Depth is easier to read from start to end, C# 7.0 in a Nutshell is, as the name suggests, the definite resource. You can look up almost everything about C# in this book.</p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
    <p><a href="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/entity-framework-core-in-action-1.png" data-fancybox=""><img src="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/entity-framework-core-in-action-1.png"></a></p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/entity-framework-core-in-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h2>Entity Framework Core in Action</h2></a>
    <p>I'm not of an Entity Framework guy. Not because I have anything against, but not using relational databases these days. But, if I were to dive deep into Entity Framework Core, this would probably be the book I would start with. I've seen it recommended over and over again on Reddit.</p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
    <p><a href="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/clr-via-csharp.png" data-fancybox=""><img src="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/clr-via-csharp.png"></a></p><a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/clr-via-c-sharp-9780735667457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h2>CLR via C#</h2></a>
    <p>Ok, this may seem a bit out-dated. But it sure helped me a lot learning about the common language runtime in .NET. Most of the code is still valid in .NET Core and I believe this is an easier read than some of the other C# books.</p>

    <p>Roy Osherove's book The Art of Unit Testing has been my go-to guide for writing good unit tests for years. With examples in C#, it's a great companion for us .NET developers.</p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
    <p><a href="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/illustrated-csharp-7.png" data-fancybox=""><img src="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/illustrated-csharp-7.png"></a></p><a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484232873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h2>Illustrated C# 7</h2></a>
    <p>I didn't read this myself, but I've heard people talking about this book as a good place to start. With its more than 800 pages and lots of good reviews, it looks like a cool book to check out for sure.</p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
    <p><a href="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/microservices-in-net-core-1.png" data-fancybox=""><img src="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/microservices-in-net-core-1.png"></a></p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/microservices-in-net-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h2>Microservices in .NET Core</h2></a>
    <p>Every time Christian Horsdal says something, I listen. I've attended a couple of talks by Christian from time to time and always feel like I learn something. That is the case with his book about Microservices as well. Look out for an upcoming edition with examples in ASP.NET Core instead of Nancy.</p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
    <p><a href="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/aspnet-core-in-action-1.png" data-fancybox=""><img src="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/aspnet-core-in-action-1.png"></a></p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/asp-net-core-in-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h2>ASP.NET Core in Action</h2></a>
    <p>Every time I google something about ASP.NET Core, I end up on Andrew Lock's blog. I learned ASP.NET Core the hard way and really would have wished for a book like this when I started looking into ASP.NET Core.</p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
    <p><a href="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/net-gurus-can-cook.png" data-fancybox=""><img src="https://blog.elmah.io/content/images/2020/04/net-gurus-can-cook.png"></a></p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/net-gurus-can-cook/9wzdncrdps5d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h2>.NET Gurus Can Cook!</h2></a>
    <p>Let's end this list with a fun one. I didn't read this one but got it recommended by my friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/Rasmuschristens" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Rasmus</a>. I love both .NET and cooking. This is a recipe collection from well-known .NET gurus like Scott Guthrie and Julie Lerman. Bon appétit.</p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>When looking through the list, I admit that the list is a bit dominated by Manning. While it would be obvious to believe that I receive a cut, I don't. To be honest, Manning is just producing some awesome books for .NET developers. Do you believe we've missed something? Let me know through the support widget in the lower right corner.</p>
