<p>
  The <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> project has <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3906">made good</a> on <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3766">previous threats</a> to actively prevent
  Ubuntu Snap packages from being installed through the APT package-management
  system without the user's consent. This move is the result of "<span>major
  worries</span>" from Linux Mint on Snap's impact with regard to user choice
  and software freedom. Ubuntu's parent company, Canonical, seems open to
  finding a solution to satisfy the popular distribution's concerns — but it
  too has interests to consider.
</p>

<h4>
  Backstory
</h4>

<p>
  The Linux Mint distribution is based on Debian and Ubuntu, <a href="https://linuxmint.com/about.php">providing over 30,000 packages</a> from
  these projects. These packages are provided using the well-known APT
  packaging system used by both upstream distributions. Ubuntu, however, in
  2014 started distributing software in parallel to APT using a technology
  called <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Snap is a self-contained package-deployment system designed to make it easier
  to manage dependencies of an application in a Linux environment. Developed by
  Canonical, Snap is designed so that its packages contain all of the specific
  dependencies a software package needs to run, bundled into a single
  filesystem image. This allows a software package to run on a system that has
  otherwise incompatible versions of needed libraries, or even to have two
  different versions of a single software package with different dependencies
  easily coexist on a single machine. Essentially, it allows one package to be
  created per architecture that can run on any common Linux distribution.
</p>

<p>
  The technology solves important package-management problems for Canonical and
  Ubuntu. It also has a strategic business value, as it allows
  Canonical-managed software to be installed on a competing distribution. The
  technology problem Canonical wants to solve is to simplify support for
  software packages, such as <a href="https://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a>,
  across the multiple versions of Ubuntu. Relying strictly on APT requires
  independent packages to be maintained for each Ubuntu version, since various
  Ubuntu releases ship with different and potentially incompatible libraries.
  This represents a large workload that Canonical would rather not deal with,
  and to which Snap provides an elegant technical solution.
</p>

<p>
  From a business perspective, widespread adoption of Snap as a universal
  package-distribution technology would put Canonical in a strong position to
  control Linux software distribution. This fact is not lost by Canonical's
  competition — Red Hat supports a similar <a href="http://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a> technology. Unlike Snap, however, the
  Flatpak project <a href="https://flatpak.org/about/">aims</a> to be an
  independent community and a "<span>true upstream open source project,
  dedicated to providing technology and services that can be used by all, with
  no vendor lock-in.</span>"
</p>

<p>
  The problems with Linux Mint came to a head when Ubuntu moved Chromium to
  Snap distribution in Ubuntu 19.10. On the surface, that isn't a problem in
  and of itself — the Linux Mint project can always start providing its own
  Chromium APT packages. The problem was the decision to change the Ubuntu
  <tt>chromium-browser</tt> APT package itself upstream in Ubuntu. Previously,
  that package would simply install Chromium directly. With the change, it
  would instead install the Snap package-management tools first and then
  install the Snap equivalent of the Chromium package — without making it
  clear to the user what was happening.
</p>

<p>
  This behavior isn't limited to Chromium either, Canonical is <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/is-ubuntu-software-going-to-be-remove-for-snap-snap-store/14542">
  using this approach on other packages as well</a>, such as
  <tt>gnome-software</tt>. This decision to use APT to install a secondary,
  commercially-controlled package-management system, which then installs the
  software the user wanted, is the center of the controversy with Linux Mint.
  As was reported on the Linux Mint blog when the Chromium change was made:
</p>

<p>
    A self-installing Snap Store which overwrites part of our APT package base
    is a complete NO NO. It's something we have to stop and it could mean the
    end of Chromium updates and access to the snap store in Linux Mint.
  </p>

<h4>
  What's at stake and recent events
</h4>

<p>
  The recent decision by the Linux Mint project isn't about Chromium or any
  single package, but rather about the entire approach Canonical is taking to
  Snap and APT. Snap packages are effectively black-boxes; they cannot be
  reproduced independently as the packaging data is controlled by the package
  maker alone. Further, the Snap package manager is locked into Canonical's
  library (called the Snap Store) so independent third-party Snap repositories
  aren't currently an option, either. While Snap packages can be downloaded and
  installed from other sources manually, doing so requires passing along a
  rather ominous <tt>--dangerous</tt> flag.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/is-ubuntu-software-going-to-be-remove-for-snap-snap-store/14542/3">
  According to Canonical Engineering Manager Ken VanDine</a>, the decision to
  replace APT packages with Snap is driven by efficiency, and to apply pressure
  in ways beneficial to Canonical. Regarding moving the <tt>gnome-software</tt>
  APT package to Snap, VanDine said:
</p>

<p>
    By shipping such a key application as a snap it will continue to keep
    pressure on to ensure we keep improving the experience while also reducing
    our maintenance burden for the LTS and future releases of Ubuntu.
  </p>

<p>
  So while the Linux Mint project took action specifically when Ubuntu's
  decision impacted the popular <tt>chromium-browser</tt> package, it seems
  this was more of the tipping point for the project than an isolated concern.
  According to the project, these moves from Canonical "<span>could reduce
  access to free (as in beer) software and free (as in freedom)
  software.</span>" It wasn't a sudden decision either — a year ago the Linux
  Mint project wanted to find a reasonable solution to the problem by working
  with Canonical, however nothing seems to have come of those conversations. In
  fact, it is unclear if any conversations happened at all.
</p>

<p>
  What is known is that, when Ubuntu 20.04 was released a year later, the APT
  package that installed Chromium still installed the Snap version without the
  consent (or necessarily even knowledge) of the user. In response, the Linux
  Mint project made good on its previous threat; starting with Linux Mint 20
  "<span>Chromium won't be an empty package which installs snapd behind your
  back. It will be an empty package which tells you why it's empty and tells
  you where to look to get Chromium yourself.</span>" In addition, Linux Mint
  20's APT package manager "<span>will forbid snapd from getting
  installed.</span>" The project doesn't appear to be outright forbidding users
  from using Snap if they want to, but doing so would require <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/06/enable-snap-apps-linux-mint-20">explicit
  action</a> from the user as "<span>by default APT won't allow repository
  packages [to install Snap] on your behalf.</span>" Presumably this applies to
  any package that Ubuntu has migrated to Snap upstream — including both
  <tt>chromium-browser</tt> and <tt>gnome-software</tt>.
</p>

<p>
  It appears the decision had an effect, and prompted Canonical to at least
  discuss a change in course <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ubuntu-opens-the-door-to-talking-with-linux-mint-about-snap/">
  according to recent reporting by ZDNet</a>. A representative from Canonical,
  quoted by ZDNet, said:
</p>

<p>
    We would welcome Linux Mint to engage with us and our community to discuss
    such topics, as we do with other distributions, and work together going
    forward.
  </p>

<p>
  Canonical's community manager for Ubuntu engineering services, Alan Pope,
  provided a justification specifically for the migration of Chromium to Snap.
  The justification, however, didn't cite the idea of keeping
  "<span>pressure</span>" expressed by VanDine regarding other packages like
  <tt>gnome-software</tt>:
</p>

<div>
  <p>
    Maintaining a single release of Chromium is a significant time investment
    for the Ubuntu Desktop Team working with the Ubuntu Security team to
    deliver updates to each stable release. As the teams support numerous
    stable releases of Ubuntu, the amount of work is compounded. Comparing this
    workload to other Linux distributions which have a single supported rolling
    release misses the nuance of supporting multiple Long Term Support (LTS)
    and non-LTS releases. [...]
  </p>

  <p>
    A Snap needs to be built only once per architecture, and will run on all
    systems that support Snapd. This covers all supported Ubuntu releases
    including 14.04 with Extended Security Maintenance (ESM), as well as other
    distributions like Debian, Fedora, Mint, and Manjaro.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  It will be interesting to see what if anything comes out of this to
  facilitate a resolution between the parties. <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3766">In its blog posts</a>, Linux Mint has
  mentioned various changes to Snap, such as allowing third-parties to run
  independent Snap package servers, that might help get to a solution. As the
  project wrote, "<span>snap could work both as a client and a file format, if
  it didn't lock us into a single store.</span>" Doing so, however, would
  likely run contrary to Canonical's strategic goals.
</p>

<h4>
  What's next
</h4>

<p>
  It's important to realize that, fundamentally, a technology like Snap would
  be useful for those who create packages, including proprietary software
  vendors. The problem in this case doesn't seem to be the technology, but
  Canonical's sole control over it — and the way it's being introduced through
  APT. As the Linux Mint project stated in its 2019 post:
</p>

<p>
    [Snap] was supposed to make it possible to run newer apps on top of older
    libraries and to let 3rd party editors publish their software easily toward
    multiple distributions [...] What we didn't want it to be was for Canonical
    to control the distribution of software between distributions and 3rd party
    editors, to prevent direct distribution from editors, to make it so
    software worked better in Ubuntu than anywhere else and to make its store a
    requirement.
  </p>

<p>
  Ultimately there are multiple interests at play here leading to uncertainty
  on how things will work out. On one hand, you have companies like Canonical
  that see the strategic value of controlling the technology behind application
  distribution, and is using it to apply pressure where it wants to see change.
  On the other hand, you have distributions like Linux Mint that are prepared
  to actively block the technology while it is controlled by a single
  commercial interest. Hopefully this latest move by Linux Mint will prompt a
  change toward more openness, as a packaging system like Snap implemented in
  an open way would be a win for the entire Linux community.
