The small and misleading grain of truth in these reasons can sound very persuasive. Here's why they're wrong.</p>
<ul></ul></div></div><div><div id="Justification 1: 'Password pasting allows brute force attacks'"><div><div><div><p><span>If password pasting is allowed, that represents a vulnerability where malicious software or web pages could repeatedly paste password guesses into the password box until they break your password.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>This&nbsp;<em><span>is</span></em>&nbsp;true, but it's also true that there are other ways to make guesses (for example through an API) that are just as easy for attackers to set up, but are&nbsp;<strong><span>much</span></strong>&nbsp;faster at guessing. The risk of brute force attacks using copy and paste is very small.</span></p></div></div></div></div><div id="Justification 2: 'Pasting passwords makes them easier to forget, because you have fewer chances to practise them'."><div><div><div><p><span>It's true - in principle - that the more times you recall something, the easier it is next time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In the real world though, people are made to have passwords for things that they hardly ever use. This means there isn't enough time to practise, and therefore little chance of remembering. This whole justification only works if you assume, to begin with, that users&nbsp;<em><span>should</span></em>&nbsp;always have to try and remember their passwords - and that's not always true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>People are also made to have passwords for things they use so often they couldn't forget the password even if they wanted to (which is quite inconvenient if you're forced to change the password regularly), and typing in the rotten thing again and again eats into their day. Password managers are a stick these people lean on, and SPP kicks it away.<o:p></o:p></span></p></div></div></div></div><div id="Justification 3: 'Passwords would hang around in the clipboard'"><div><div><div><p>When anyone copies and pastes, the copied content is kept in a 'clipboard' where it can be pasted as many times as they want. Any software installed on the computer (or any person operating it) has access to the clipboard, and can see what's in there. Copying anything usually writes over what was already in the clipboard and destroys it.</p>
<p>Many password managers copy your password to the clipboard so they can paste it into the password box on websites. The possible risk is that an attacker (or malware) will steal your password before it's erased from the clipboard.</p>
<p>Passwords remaining in the clipboard might be more of an issue if you're manually copying and pasting your passwords from a document you have on your computer. You might forget to clear the clipboard. However it's not much of a risk because:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Most password managers erase the clipboard as soon as they have pasted your password into the website, and some avoid the clipboard completely by typing in the password with a 'virtual keyboard' instead.</li>
<li>The web browser 'Internet Explorer 6' allows evil web pages to copy the clipboard; but very few people in the UK still use IE6 to browse the web.</li>
<li>Viruses installed on your computer can have clipboard copiers on them, and grab your pasted passwords. That's still not a good reason for SPP though; when your computer gets infected you can't trust it&nbsp;<em>at all</em>. Viruses and other malware that copy the clipboard nearly always also copy every letter, number and symbol typed on your computer, including your passwords. They would steal your password whether or not it was in the clipboard, so you're not really gaining much by SPP.</li>
