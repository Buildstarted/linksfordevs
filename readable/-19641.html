Weâ€™re in the planning stages for Season Twelve of E@RTC. We have a lot of behind the scenes volunteers work going on as we think about how to improve our next season.</p><p>This website contains a lot of information about what weâ€™re about, our philosophy of putting fun ahead of everything, except safety, and making our momâ€™s mad. This is a site designed to entertain as much as inform, so even if youâ€™re not interested in our rules, they are still good reading. By the way, did you know that slugs are natureâ€™s gum?</p><p>For the latest news and if weâ€™re on or off that Saturday, because of rain, or because one of us somehow got ebola, see our <a href="https://www.exoticsat.com/blog" target="_blank"><strong>blog</strong></a>. We have our special events up for the season on our <a href="https://www.exoticsat.com/special-events" target="_blank"><strong>events</strong></a> page, not to be confused with the fun we have every Saturday morning. These are the special event days when we turn it up to 11. &nbsp;Still, for your protection, keep an eye on our <a href="https://exoticsat.com/blog/" target="_blank"><strong>blog</strong></a>&nbsp;for the latest news!</p><p>We guarantee you at least 72.6% more fun each season or no money back. For your viewing pleasure, we also have a community-driven <a href="https://exoticsat.com/photos/" target="_blank"><strong>photos</strong></a> page that has individual photographers who all have control over their own content, making it far more interesting than ever before, no, not<em> that</em> interesting, itâ€™s just cars. Many of them continued to update thier pages all winter long. Once we're in season, they post new photos almost every day.</p><p>We will put up more interesting links, stuff to see and do, and more about destinations after E@RTC. Everything at E@RTC is FREE! Yup, F-R-E-E for those in Fresno. We make it up in volume!&nbsp;Yes, you heard that right, so pick yourself up off the floor!&nbsp;It costs you absolutely nothing other than the cost of the juice to run whatever you're reading this on. So, it's a great deal to come here and hang out, spend some time, see some cars, have a laugh or two, but most of all, have fun!</p><h3>Photos<a href="https://www.exoticsat.com/photos">&nbsp; â†’</a></h3></div></div></div></div></div>
