<p>Hey, Chris here. </p>
<p>I&apos;m pulling this sponsored post. </p>
<p>It was for a paid SSL service. I&apos;m very much not an SSL expert. I&apos;ve always relied on my host to install SSL certificates on my servers and manage it. I know enough that I know about Let&apos;s Encrypt and how that&apos;s a big deal to the industry in how they offer SSL certificates for free. So when I agreed to this post, I asked them to compare themselves to Let&apos;s Encrypt, and they sent me 12 points that differentiate them. The points seemed fine to me (as a non-expert), if a little spun with marketing. But there was a good amount of pushback on Twitter on those points, and the company got pretty aggressive on Twitter about it in a way that was a major turn-off to me. This is not an acceptable way to act for any company to act that I want to be associated with. </p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
