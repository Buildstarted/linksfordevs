Critics have alleged the report is being withheld because it shows Russians have made large donations to the Conservative Party, which is seeking to win a majority that would allow Johnson to push his Brexit deal through Parliament.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-70 Component-p-0-2-62">Security Minister Brandon Lewis dismissed such criticism and in turn accused Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of failing to back the government in the aftermath of a Russian-sponsored nerve agent attack against a former spy on the streets of an English city.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-70 Component-p-0-2-62">Asked about Russian donors to the campaign, Lewis told Sky television on Sunday that all contributions are reported to the proper authorities and the donors in question have British citizenship.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-70 Component-p-0-2-62">“We should not prevent British citizens from taking and playing their full part in British political life,” he said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-70 Component-p-0-2-62">Former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the 2016 U.S. presidential election found that Russia interfered in the vote in a “sweeping and systemic” fashion. While President Donald Trump dismissed the findings, the U.S. investigation put Russia at the center of worries about the integrity of elections worldwide.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-70 Component-p-0-2-62">The House of Commons Intelligence and Security Committee began its investigation following allegations of Russian interference in both the 2016 U.S. election and the Brexit referendum earlier that year.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-70 Component-p-0-2-62">The committee sent its report to Johnson for review on Oct. 17, saying it expected to “publish the report imminently.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-70 Component-p-0-2-62">Committee Chairman Dominic Grieve has criticized Johnson’s government for failing to release the document amid media reports it has already been cleared by British security services.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-70 Component-p-0-2-62">The debate comes amid growing concerns about the security of elections fought in an increasingly digital world. Britain’s election laws were written for a time when campaigns pushed mass-produced leaflets through mail slots, rather than flooding Facebook and Twitter accounts with individually targeted messages.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-70 Component-p-0-2-62">Johnson called the early election in response to the political turmoil caused by Britain’s pending departure from the EU. Britain’s 46 million eligible voters will choose 650 lawmakers in the House of Commons in the Dec. 12 vote.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-70 Component-p-0-2-62">___</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-70 Component-p-0-2-62">Follow AP’s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at <a class="" href="/Brexit">https://www.apnews.com/Brexit</a></p></div></div></div></div>
