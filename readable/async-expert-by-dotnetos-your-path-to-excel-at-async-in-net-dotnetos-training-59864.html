      While .NET environment was receiving another tools connected with concurrency and async programming, reception and feelings were mixed. On one hand the received opportunities were amazing. On the the other, it created the necessity to learn and use totally different elements of the language as well as mechanisms included in .NET itself...
    </p>
    
    <p>
      While training engineers during internal and opened trainings, discussing during conferences and browsing the last Dotnetos survey records - in which almost 500 persons from all over the world took part - we’ve noticed that <strong>async programming and concurrency are very important for you</strong>. This is a topic which engineers related to .NET want to learn. We ourselves share that opinion. <strong>Today programming in .NET is almost impossible without understanding of concurrency and async-await technique.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To help you gain that knowledge and understand the basics and rules of async world and concurrency we prepared that Async Expert online course. <strong>Async Expert is 9 solid weeks of learning through which we will guide you from the async basics to sync and concurrency collections</strong>. To allow you to verify possessed knowledge we prepared suitable houseworks. <strong>3 LIVE meetings with our mentors (Marc Gravel, Daniel Marbach, Steve Cleary)</strong> during which they will help to answer all your extra questions are an additional bonus. Everything will be completed with communication with us via the course platform.

  <p>🌶 <strong>Which programming language will be used in examples?</strong></p>
  <p>All the examples as well as all our work will be done in C#.</p>
  
  <p>🌶 <strong>When does the registration begin and when does it end?</strong></p>
  <p>Registration for the course pre-sale begins on Thursday, 19.03.2020 at 09:00 AM and it ends on Friday, 03.04.2020 at 8:00 PM. After that time it will be impossible to join the program at a promotional, lower price.</p>
  
  <p>🌶 <strong>When does the course begin and for how long does it last?</strong></p>
  <p>The course begins in 2020. Every week you receive an access to the next week-unit. New material is added every week to not overwhelm you and to allow all the group to get through it at the same time.</p>
  
  <p>🌶 <strong>What is the format of that course?</strong></p>
  <p>It is a video course. Recordings are uploaded to the platform. After signing in ich your login and password you have an access to your account. Besides the recordings, the platform includes a forum, thanks to which you can communicate with an instructor and other participants. Links, password and login will be passed one week before the course begins.</p>
  
  <p>🌶 <strong>How long will I have the access to the course?</strong></p>
  <p>You will receive life-long access to that edition of the course, including its updates.</p>
  
  <p>🌶 <strong>What if I would not be satisfied with the course?</strong></p>
  <p>If you consider the course is not for you, you will receive a refund. You have 30 days to decide. Just write to contact@dotnetos.org, and we will return you 100% value.</p>
