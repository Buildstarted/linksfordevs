The main goal of Scalar was to start some interesting discussions during the breaks and the after party, and inspire people to explore Scala ecosystem more. Some of the insights were gathered in the form of the traditional whiteboard voting results, where we uncovered the <strong class="gm hc">current trends</strong> and the <strong class="gm hc">future of Scala</strong>.</p><h2 id="ca1a" class="ib ic ed at as hp id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in">What‚Äôs next?</h2><ul class=""><li id="54a6" class="gk gl ed at gm b gn io gp ip gr iq gt ir gv is gx it iu iv">Make sure to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDHLL2QvdpCytAfBiwUeKgg" class="da by gy gz ha hb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> channel, where we will be uploading all the talks, starting tomorrow.
