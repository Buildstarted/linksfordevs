My name is Thorsten Ball. I'm a writer and programmer
living in Aschaffenburg, Germany. In my professional life as a
software developer, I build web applications and platforms. I have
deployed Ruby, JavaScript, Go and C code to production systems.</p><p>In my spare time, though, I like to do what I call <em>recreational
programming</em>, where I dig deep into various topics and their
codebases, taking them apart, recreating them in my own code, trying
to peel away layers of what seems like magic, hoping to come out the
other end with a better understanding of what it is that I do when I
program.</p><p>For the last few years, the two topics that kept my attention are
systems programming and programming languages: interpreters,
compilers, virtual machines, JIT compilers, assembly language â€“ I
can't get enough of it.</p><p>Writing an interpreter from scratch and writing <a href="https://interpreterbook.com">a book about
that</a> has been one of the most wonderful and satisfying things
I ever did as a programmer. It has been so much fun, in fact, that I
couldn't stop doing it, which is why you're looking at the next book.</p><p>You can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/thorstenball">@thorstenball on Twitter</a> to know what I'm up
to. If you want to know more about me, visit <a href="http://thorstenball.com">my blog and
website</a> or take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/mrnugget">GitHub profile</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>
