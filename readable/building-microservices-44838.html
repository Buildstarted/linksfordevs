<h6>Description</h6>
<p>To build a successful microservices application, you need to make many key choices about what technologies and techniques you will use. In this course, Building Microservices, you will learn about several patterns and practices that will enable you to successfully build microservices. First, you will learn about how to structure domain logic and implement a data mapping layer. Next, you will discover the various ways to test microservices. Finally, you will learn how to handle authentication and authorization for communication between microservices. When you are finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge to build microservices that are maintainable, testable, and secure.</p>

<p><span>Course Overview</span><br>[Autogenerated] Hi, My name's Mark Heath and welcome to my course building. Micro service is I work as a software architect at Nice Systems, where I'm currently helping to create Asher based digital evidence management systems. For the police, a micro service architecture is an excellent choice when you need to build a large, robust applications that can scale, perform well and adapt quickly to changing business requirements. In this course, we're going to learn about several patterns and practices that will help you to successfully build micro service is, and we'll be seeing how these principles are applied by exploring an example. E Commerce Micro Service based application was start off by looking at some techniques for structuring domain logic and data access code for our micro service is in a way that ensures our code is fast and maintainable. Then we'll look at how we can effectively test. Our micro service is making use of a combination of testing techniques to give us confidence that everything's working as expected, and finally, we'll look at some of the options for authentication and authorization to ensure that our micro service's are properly secured. By the end of this course, you'll be ready to build maintainable, testable and secure. Micro service is and identify which patterns and practices are a good fit for each one. The demo application will be looking at uses docker, and although you don't need to have Dr installed, if you do, you'll be able to follow along and try out the demo application for yourself. So I hope you'll join me on this journey. To learn about micro service is with the Building Micro Service's course at Plural site.</p>
