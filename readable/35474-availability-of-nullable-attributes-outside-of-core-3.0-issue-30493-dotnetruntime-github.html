Rigidly coupling language evolution to runtime also feels like a departure from what we've become accustomed to.</p><p>Perhaps I mix in strange circles but developers I hear from expected this model and even now that they know different, they still believe it will eventually happen, which is just as confusing? Probably not helped by the freedom to change <code>LangVersion</code> manually. I don't think I'm an absolute fool, yet despite what had been shared to date, I was still confused enough to post here :)</p><p>I think that unfortunately, it will slow the rate of uptake for the new features, which can only be a negative thing in the .NET community with less activity around them.</p></div></div></div></div>
