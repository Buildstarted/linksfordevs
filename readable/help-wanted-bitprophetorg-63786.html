          <h2 id="the-first-step">The first step</h2>
<p>is admitting you have a problem; so with that in mind:</p>
<p>Hi. My name’s Jeff, I maintain <a href="http://bitprophet.org/projects/">several OSS projects you may be familiar
with</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and <strong>I’m burned out</strong>.</p>
<p>I lie awake at night, unable to sleep, crippled by guilt. During the day, it’s
anxiety and fear that cripple instead, making the thought of facing the issue
tracker unbearable.</p>
<p>Development on my projects has slowed far more than I ever intended, and while
I have excuses<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, push has clearly come to shove. Something must change.</p>
<p>Until now, I’ve been a solo maintainer for various reasons, primarily a
combination of <strong>extreme pickiness</strong> (re: code quality, formatting, defensive
coding, etc) and <strong>trust issues</strong> (I have difficulty trusting others to exhibit
that same pickiness).</p>
<p>With the burnout I’m feeling, it’s sometimes tempting to give up and walk away.
But even that would require trusting others with the future of my projects!
Surely I can act less drastically first – extending trust in ways that will
get me back to productivity.</p>
<h2 id="walking-before-running">Walking before running</h2>
<p>My biggest issue? Issues! There’s too much feedback to handle alone <em>and</em> get
meaningful work done. The <strong>most valuable help</strong> I can get is <strong>ticket triage</strong>
(and to a lesser degree, <strong>PR code review</strong>) so that I can focus on development
and direction.</p>
<p>At a minimum, I need scouts, people who can alert me to significant events:
serious new bug reports, flurries of interest in an open ticket, or well
crafted PRs that are ready to merge. I’ll continue to keep my eyes off the
notification queue and trust that these new collaborators will keep me
informed.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I’d love to utilize Github’s triage role: having others labeling
issues, closing duplicate or noise tickets, and asking submitters for details
or PR alterations. I may continue doing this sort of thing myself, but
typically only on tickets that otherwise cross my desk.</p>
<h3 id="you">You</h3>
<p>It’s easiest to start with those I recognize from existing engagement, and I’ll
be reaching out today to folks who expressed prior interest. If you think
you’re in that group and didn’t hear from me, please let me know (and accept my
apologies for the oversight)!</p>
<p>For everyone else: if you can show you know your way around Python, the problem
domains involved, and the projects themselves – feel free to introduce
yourself, briefly explain how you believe you can help (or just point to
existing contributions!), and let me know which project(s) you’re interested in
supporting.</p>
<h3 id="me">Me</h3>
<p>The best way to get ahold of me is email to <code>jeff (at) bitprophet [dot] org</code>;
please put something like “Re: triage blog post” in the subject. Or use <a href="mailto:jeff@bitprophet.org?subject=Re:%20triage%20blog%20post">this
handy mailto:
link</a>.</p>
<p>I usually respond within a few days (more quickly on Fridays, which are my OSS
time).</p>
<h3 id="us">Us</h3>
<p>I don’t have a clear picture yet of exactly how collaboration will occur
(outside of Github-level features such as assignment and milestones). At the
start I’m likely to try leveraging per-project email groups, or chat like IRC
or Slack.</p>
<p>I’m open to other suggestions too, though unless something has changed
recently, this (semiprivate group discussions) is still a poorly solved area
for OSS projects.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-go-next">Where to go next</h2>
<p>Ideally, once I’ve learned to trust others with triage and review, I can take
further steps until ending up with full-on co-maintainers. Time will tell.</p>
<p>I’ll leave off with some quick roadmaps.</p>
<h3 id="short-term">Short term</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get folks set up with the triage role…</li>
<li>With their help, identify and tackle any new-to-me serious issues that have
appeared in the last 6-9mo, whether that’s bugs, broken dependencies, Python
3.8 compat, or whatever.</li>
<li>Explore migrating to Circle-CI from Travis-CI, for various reasons
(such as lack of confidence in the latter’s future after firing most of their
senior talent post-acquisition).
<ul>
<li>Possibly Github Actions, but I’d rather not make myself even more
dependent on that platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rename <code>master</code> to <code>main</code> – something I’d intended to do sooner, but there
is absolutely no time like the present!</li>
<li>Oversee merging of ‘Fabric3’ into Fabric’s v1 line; this is my olive branch
to folks struggling with Python 3 but who are frustrated with the pace of
Fabric 2 dev the last couple years.
<ul>
<li>This <em>doesn’t</em> mean that Fabric 1 is going to see more feature work; it’s
just housekeeping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="medium-term">Medium term</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get back to Fabric 2 feature work; I still want users to migrate off of v1
eventually!</li>
<li>Execute long-planned architectural improvements for Paramiko, eg improved
authentication flow.</li>
<li>Ditto Invoke, again features that have been in the wings for years, such as
task dependencies and intertask communication.</li>
</ul>
