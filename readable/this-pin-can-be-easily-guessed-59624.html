                    <h2><i></i> PIN Selection on Smartphones</h2>
                    <p>We conducted a user study focused on the selection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identification_number" target="_blank">Personal Identification Numbers (PINs)</a> based on data collected from users specifically primed for the smartphone unlock setting. Despite the rise of biometrics, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, devices still require PINs, e.g., after a restart or when the biometric fails.</p>
                    <p>As a mechanism for improving PIN selection, we also studied how PINs are affected by blacklisting. A blacklist is a set of "<i>easy to guess</i>" PINs, which triggers a warning to the user. Apple iOS devices show the warning "<b>This PIN Can Be Easily Guessed</b>" with a choice to "<i>Use Anyway</i>" or "<i>Change PIN</i>."</p>

                    <p>Our study found there is
                        <mark>little benefit to longer 6-digit PINs</mark> as compared to 4-digit PINs. Our participants tended to select more-easily guessed 6-digit PINs when considering the first 40 guesses of an attacker. Moreover, our results show that
                        <mark>currently employed PIN blacklists are ineffective.</mark> Through quantitative and qualitative feedback, we found that participants perceive that blacklisting will improve their PINs without impacting usability.</p>

                    <p>The iOS blacklist of passcodes was <mark>obtained via brute-force.</mark> To test if a PIN is blacklisted, one only needs to try it and see if a warning appears. During the initial iOS setup there is no rate-limiting in place, which enabled us to quickly test all possible PINs.
                    </p>
                    <p>We constructed <mark>a device to automate this process using a Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera.</mark> The device emulates a USB keyboard, which is connected to the iPhone. After entering a PIN, the camera takes a photo of the iPhone screen. The photo is sent to a remote server, where the presence of the blacklist warning is detected by extracting the text in the photo.</p>
                    <p>More details and photos of the PIN extraction device can be found here: <a href="https://this-pin-can-be-easily-guessed.github.io/media/Robot-2020-03-11.pdf" target="_blank" role="button"><i></i> Extracting iOS' Passcode Blacklist</a></p>

                    <p>In our study, we tested various blacklists in <i>enforcing</i> and <i>non-enforcing</i> settings. Besides Apple's 4-digit and 6-digit blacklists, we also created data-driven blacklists that are significantly (10x) smaller (27 PINs) and (10x) larger (2740 PINs) than the iOS 4-digit blacklist. To foster future research on this topic, we publish some of the studied blacklists here.</p>

                    <h2><i></i> PIN Datasets</h2>
                    <p>Before our user study, the most realistic set of 4-digit PINs was from 2011, where <a href="http://danielamitay.com/blog/2011/6/13/most-common-iphone-passcodes" target="_blank">Daniel Amitay</a> developed the iOS application "Big Brother Camera Security." The app mimicked a lock screen allowing users to set a 4-digit PIN. Amitay anonymously and surreptitiously collected 4-digit PINs (204 432). As there was no similar 6-digit PIN data available to inform our attacker, we relied on 6-digit PINs extracted from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/14/rockyou-hack-security-myspace-facebook-passwords/" target="_blank">RockYou password leak</a>, similar to <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32946-3_3" target="_blank">Bonneau et al. (2012)</a> and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3052973.3053031" target="_blank">Wang et al. (2017)</a>. PINs are extracted from consecutive sequences of exactly <i>n</i>-digits in leaked password data. By following this method, we extracted 6-digit PINs from the RockYou password leak, which we refer to as RockYou-6-digit (2 758 490 PINs). For comparison, we also provide a 4-digit version of the RockYou dataset (1 780 587 PINs).</p>
                    <table>
                        <caption>Our attacker guesses PINs in decreasing probability order based on the Amitay-4-digit and RockYou-6-digit datasets. When two or more PINs share the same frequency, i.e., it is not possible to directly determine a guessing order, we ordered those PINs using a Markov model.</caption>

                    <p>We conducted a user study of 4- and 6-digit PINs using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) with (n=1220) participants over a period of three weeks. To mimic the PIN creation process in our browser-based study, participants were restricted to mobile devices by checking the User-Agent string. We applied a 9-treatment, between-subjects study protocol for the PIN selection criteria, e.g., 4- vs. 6-digit with or without blacklisting. At the end of the study, we collected 851 and 369 PINs, 4- and 6-digits, respectively. These PINs were all selected, confirmed, and recalled. We additionally recorded all intermediate PIN selections, such as what would happen if a selected PIN was not blacklisted and the participant did not have to select a different PIN.</p>
                    <p>We share this dataset of user-chosen PINs with other research institutions upon request. Contact details (<i></i>) are published along with the paper.</p>

            <h2><i></i> Abstract</h2>
            <p>In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive study of user-chosen 4- and 6-digit PINs (n=1220) collected on smartphones with participants being explicitly primed for the situation of device unlocking. We find that against a throttled attacker (with 10, 30, or 100 guesses, matching the smartphone unlock setting), using 6-digit PINs instead of 4-digit PINs provides little to no increase in security, and surprisingly may even decrease security.</p>
            <p>We also study the effects of blacklists, where a set of "easy to guess" PINs is disallowed during selection. Two such blacklists are in use today by iOS, for 4-digits (274 PINs) as well as 6-digits (2910 PINs). We extracted both blacklists compared them with four other blacklists, including a small 4-digit (27 PINs), a large 4-digit (2740 PINs), and two placebo blacklists for 4- and 6-digit PINs that always excluded the first-choice PIN. We find that relatively small blacklists in use today by iOS offer little or no benefit against a throttled guessing attack. Security gains are only observed when the blacklists are much larger, which in turn comes at the cost of increased user frustration. Our analysis suggests that a blacklist at about 10% of the PIN space may provide the best balance between usability and security.</p>
