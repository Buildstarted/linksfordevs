You will not be able to refill your postage meter until we resolve our systems outage, but if you have funds loaded you will be able to print postage. </p></li> <li> <p>This system outage is affecting our mailing system products and Your Account access. All of our systems are being closely monitored, and things may change, but at this point in time these systems are working:</p> <ul> <li>Mailing machines can print indicia, if funds are available</li> <li>SendPro C and P devices can print shipping labels from the device</li> <li>SendPro Online in the U.S., SendPro Enterprise, SendSuite Live, SendSuite Express, SendSuite Tracking (SST), SendSuite Tracking Online (SSTO) and Relay Hub are all operational</li> </ul> <p><strong>The following systems are currently NOT working:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Clients are unable to refill postage or upload transactions on their mailing machine</li> <li>SendPro Online in the UK and Canada </li> <li>Your Account and the Pitney Bowes Supplies web store cannot be accessed. This in turn impacts clients subscribed to AutoInk and our Supplies App </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In consultation with our security advisors on this issue, we do not believe there are other client risks. The meters themselves run operating systems that are not affected. The meters will continue to operate as normal with the funds they have in them, and we will resume normal refill services as soon as possible. </p></li> </ol> <ol> <li> <p>Yes. A limited number of our products have some features that are impacted as a result of the systems outage (Mail360 Scans, MIPro Licensing). If you experience a problem, please engage your local Technical Support organization to diagnose your issue.</p></li> <li> <p>In consultation with our security advisors on this issue, we do not believe there are other client risks. The Software and Data products themselves are not directly affected because they do not access the backend systems of the Pitney Bowes network. We have seen no evidence that customer accounts or data have been impacted.</p></li> <li> <p>This system outage is affecting our Your Account access, Data fulfillment, and some of our Support pages. All of our systems are being closely monitored, and things may change, but at this point in time these systems are currently NOT working:</p> <ul> <li>Software and Data Marketplace downloads are unavailable</li> <li>Your Account and some of the product support pages are unavailable</li> </ul></li> </ol> <ol> <li> <p>All cross border solutions, as well as all shipping technology, label generation and tracking solutions were not impacted.</p> <p>Fulfillment, Delivery and Returns clients were impacted and Pitney Bowes is working directly with affected clients to mitigate business disruption.</p></li> <li> <p>Presort services were impacted but we are working with clients and the USPS to mitigate any business disruption.</p> </li> </ol> </div>
