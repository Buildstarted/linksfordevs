  Been a Samsung T5 owner for a while, and couple other SSDs.<br>Was excited that Samsung got a USB 3.2 SSD, which should be much faster.<p>NOTE: If you want to be able to take full benefit of the T7 Drives, You need to have USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 on your PC/Laptop!!  Without the USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports, it will perform pretty much like the T5.</p><p>I have tested on my 2019 Surface Laptop 3 with USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 support. I was able to get the full speed from the best, and also copying files to it.  Seems to be very fast!! But!!!  As the file gets larger, the speed/performance started to decrease.  This is not noticeable if the file size is smaller than 1gb, but once the file gets larger then 1gb, the larger they get, the worse the performance gets.  I have also tested the T7 on my 2014 Macbook Pro, with USB 3.0.  The speed test shows that its about the same speed as the T5.</p><p>Bottom line, When transferring smaller files, the T7 is super fast!!! As file size gets bigger, especially lager than 1gb files, you will start to see some performance/speed decrease.  Since I do a lot of video editing, and files can be huge, this can be a problem for me.  I think I will wait to upgrade to the newer T7 drives.  Until the speed can be improved, and more stable.</p><p>Here is my test, and experience</p><p>Tested with my new MS Surface Laptop 3 13", with USB-C 3.2</p><p>Crystal Disk Mark tests 1gb ( see attached photo for test details)<br>T7<br>SEQ1M read: 1055.43 MB/s<br>SEQ1M write: 938.51 MB/s<br>RND4K read: 273.95 MB/s<br>RND4k write: 272.41 MB/s</p><p>T5<br>SEQ1M read: 565.00 MB/s<br>SEQ1M write: 522.20 MB/s<br>RND4K read:  237.65 MB/s<br>RND4k write: 196.17 MB/s</p><p>Actual File Coping Experience<br>T7 File transfer<br>1gb: 3 seconds<br>10gb: 22 seconds</p><p>T5 File transfer<br>1gb: 4 seconds<br>10gb: 35 seconds

  Avoid Samsung SSD T7. My experience is similar to the experiences others have had with this product. Specifically, SSD causes computers to over heat. The SSD also gets extremely hot! The issue does not correlate to i/o or computational load. The issue occurs the moment the SSD is attached to the computer. Interestingly, the Samsung T5 does not have these problems. It is my conjecture that the T7 is simply an overclocked T5. If my suspicions are true Samsung is engaging in very shady business practices.  Please do your self a huge favor and avoid the T7 as it will ruin your hardware.

  I own the T5 and decided to give this a try as it is supposedly faster.  So I ordered the 2TB non-fingerprint model in red.  What I noticed first is that this drive is slow to power up.  It takes closed to 30 seconds from when Windows 10 detects the plug to when you can actually use the drive.  The drive also sometimes disconnects.<p>But the deal breaker for me is that it does not deliver the at the rated 1,000 MB/s for read or write.  I fact I am not able to hit 700 MB/s read testing on multiple systems and cables.  Writing seems to be slightly higher but not by much.  I did the tests using Crystal Disk Mark and also by copying large (30GB) files.  The old T5 which is rated for 540 MB/s consistently delivers in the 600 MB/s range for read and the write speed is the same as the newer T7.</p><p>Given the price, physical size, performance, and other issues, I will stick with the T5.  They both max out at 2TB and there is really no reason to pay extra to get a bulkier drive that does not provide a noticeable speed gain.

  This thing cost me a week of my life.<br>If you are thinking of getting this instead of the T5 then think again.<br>As mentioned in other reviews below, this SSD overheats, it causes the CPU usage to go insane, it constantly disconnects for no reason.<br>I called Samsung support, the guy had no clue how to troubleshoot the issue.<br>I ordered a replacement on Amazon, spent another day with the replacement, exact same issue.<br>My Ravpower SSD And the T5 run perfectly with no disconnects and normal cpu usage.

  This drive lives up to its speed claims, right around 900mb/s on my iMacPro... but. The drive runs very hot, even when its idle. I have it sitting right next to its brother, a Samsung T5 2TB SSD and that drive never gets hot even when hiting it hard (temp right now is (87-degrees F) while the T7 is hitting 100+ degrees F at idle.<p>Sometime the temperature of the T7 spikes very hard and the drive unmounts itself. At that point I am forced to unplug it, let it cool and then plug it back in. The it will run normally for a time before starting to run hotter and hotter.</p><p>I've read all about this drive's fancy thermal management, but I don't buy it. You probably shouldn't either. get the T5. Its half the speed, but still fast, and more importantly it wont burn itself up.

  Small, fast, and comes in choice of colors. This drive is at its best when plugged into a USB C thunderbolt port on a Mac. I cannot give you any deep tech analysis but when I moved an 80 gig file from my SSD NVme internal storage on a Macbook pro to this device felt like it was 10 times faster than a traditional SSD 3.0 Ssta drive.  They are not the fastest out there but a dedicated Thunderbolt drive gets very hot and will slow down to the same speed as this when they get hot.  So save some money, go with this unit with no heat problems.
