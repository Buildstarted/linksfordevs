  Purchased the thermometer to monitor the temperature/humidity level in a meat curing cabinet. After I read the instructions I downloaded the app to my phone which allows me to monitor the conditions in the curing cabinet from any location. You have two options to mount the thermometer:1. Place it in the wall mount that you can stick on the wall or 2. I chose to use the table mount.  Been using it for a week and so far I have been very happy with the performance. I also like the app which is easy to use and also will show you the history of the temperature and humidity for a week, month, or year. I gave the battery life an average rating because I haven’t used it long enough to comment on that aspect.

  I am so sick of regular radio frequency wireless thermometers! They are very inaccurate and super short range!<br>These Govee's are very accurate and have good range. Not sure what the range is yet. But is is so much better than RF thermo's.<br>I got two of these and both read exactly the same when next to one another. Amazing!<br>They have the accuracy of wired probe thermometer. And they match my known accurate thermometer. They can also be calibrated. Mine are perfectly calibrated out of the box. YMMV<p>A little bug I encountered was one of these locked up. Kept reading 84.2 and 64% humidity. Was stuck. I could not connect to it by bluetooth. I removed the device in the app. And tried to re-pair it. The screen did blink, but it could not pair. I had to remove a battery for a few seconds. Seems to be fixed.</p><p>Edit: Love these! I bought some more. These are perfection so far. Stay tuned!

  I like not having to open my home hacked charcuterie/dry aging chamber in a heavy Yeti cooler to get an accurate reading. This bluetooth thermometer doesn't seem to do 'push' notifications and I have to request a current reading via the app even if my phone has been within 100 feet of the box all day, but it's quick and intuitive to do. The battery has held up fine so far, though it's only been a few weeks. I had a question and their customer service was quickly responsive and helped me solve the issue. I should have gotten the wifi model but this one is still very handy. Would buy again, though with wifi next time.

  Really impressed how fast this can read temperature changes, at 2 seconds.  The app works generally well, always connected, and re syncing all the data takes about 10 seconds with my Pixel 2.  The graphs are nicely laid out and easy to use.  My only complaint it to have developer change the format to AM/PM, instead of 24 hour time.  As you can see in my photos, i'm using a cheap amazon cell phone stand I had laying around.  Much better for accurate results, as a wall can absorb heat.  This helps to generate a more ambient temperature and allows me to move it around for other tests.

  Bought this for my plants. With all of the dry heat now in the winter, I want to be sure that my tropicals are happy. Seems to be working accurately so far. The temp said 70F and my home thermostat is set at 70 as well, so I know that’s right. I don’t have another way to measure the humidity in my house, but I trust this device since the air temp is right. There is an app but I haven’t used that yet.

  plotting humidity and temperature over hours to months is fantastic!<br>Track crawl space humidity and attic temperatures to verify proper ventilation AND you can check it on your phone!<br>Now I have to buy a second to compare the inside and outside conditions.<br>The only short fall is mounting is with a 3M two sided tape only with no nail/screw/hook hole

  Smaller than I expected but doesn't really matter I'm not planning to look at it much. Easy to use, hooked up to Bluetooth first try, double tap to switch back and forth between celcius and f (yeah not even autocorrect can help me spell that.)<p>Main thing is I can monitor the temperature of my garage from inside. Right now it goes through two exterior walls about 20 feet away and it's slow, much slower than within the same room but it works. Seems like that's about the max distance you'll get. The temperature and humidity sensor is pretty cool and seems very accurate.</p><p>Oh the app is not easy to find you have to search "govee" with the quotation marks to get it in the Android app store.

  can be used without the app and shows temperature in C or F. The app connects by Bluetooth and needs a location access on the phone or it doesn't work which is annoying and strange so i dont use it.

  I have two small kids and I loooove this product. I was initially worried about the range in my house - but I’ve had no issues.  In fact, it works perfectly. I can check the temperature in the kids bedrooms whenever I need to. Love it.
