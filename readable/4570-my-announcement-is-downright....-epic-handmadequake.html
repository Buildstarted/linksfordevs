Epic : HandmadeQuake</h1><div><div theme="[object Object]" class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Is that a big enough hint?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I've taken a job with Epic Games! I am now a UI Programmer on Paragon, their 3D MOBA that is technologically advanced and a ton of fun! This is my first week, and the build up to this position has been the main reason videos have been so sporadic lately.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This likely will lead you to wondering if the series will be continuing or not. This position has led to me moving to North Carolina, and gives me a large task of getting up to speed on a brand new codebase, and really even a new engine - all my professional experience is with UE3, so I need to ramp up to UE4 as well. I have a lot on my plate in this moment.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">That said, I absolutely do not want to quit this series. It's a ton of fun, I know how many of you love it, and it is a resource that I still believe is lacking in general game development education. It would benefit the industry to have this complete series exist, and I want to see that happen.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So here is my current position. No videos this week, probably no videos next week either. I simply have too much new work to do. However, I have some ideas on a better way to organize the material I'm covering. I'm not entirely happy with my long term planning at the moment, and I think I have an idea that will help with the flow of videos between modules, especially once we stop building these separate systems and start pulling them all together.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">To that end, even though no new videos will be coming out, I will be working on the planning phase. If I can get a solid curriculum together, I think it will help make the recording go quicker, and make it easier to ultimately release content on a regular basis.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I will keep you posted on at least a weekly basis. I have no intention of disappearing, and I have every intention of continuing. It's just impossible to say how the next several months will go.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I am going to shut down the Patreon though, either way. I truly, truly appreciate everyone who has donated, but there are many projects in the handmade network that deserve your support. I find it incorrect to have a donation page up when I can't 100% vouch for a regular schedule. I encourage you to go through the network, and take any money you were sending to me and send it to someone else. The community is in its infancy, and deserves support to help it grow. Every dollar donated now will help make it that much stronger, that much faster.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So I will probably log off here until this weekend. I will update you then.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">And if you have $20 to spend, Paragon is already a very fun game - a fully 3D MOBA that is exciting to play and in a very beta state. We have a lot of great ideas to come over the next months, but the core is already engaging. Anyone in?</p></div></div></div></div>
