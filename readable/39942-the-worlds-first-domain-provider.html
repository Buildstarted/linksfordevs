When you purchase a domain product the account is automatically set to Auto Renew. This protects you from losing your domain name. Auto Renew ensures your domain name is safe by automatically charging the account approximately sixty (60) to ninety (90) days prior to the end of the term period. Before your product expires, you will receive an automatic renewal reminder letting you know the date that your card will be charged. You may be asked to update your payment information if your credit card on file is invalid. When an Automatic Renewal processes, you receive an email confirming the order and that the renewal was successful. This occurs 60 days before product expiration or if renewed on a later renewal attempt. </p><p>An <strong>Order Payment Failure</strong> email is sent when an automatic renewal fails. This occurs 60 days before product expiration and every failed attempt after, which occurs every 14 days to give you plenty of time to fix the issue before the product or service expires. </p><p>If Auto Renew is not set up, Network Solutions customers have to manually renew domain names through their Account Manager portal. That is also the same place to change your renew status to either turn it on for automatic renewals or turn it off to control domain renewals manually. </p></li></ul></p> <li> <p class="q">How can Network Solutions help me if I run into technical issues?</p> <p class="a"> Our customer support agents are ready to assist you on the phone at <a href="tel:18776288686">1-877-628-8686</a> or on our website via chat. </p><p>We are a team full of technical expertise to help you with anything you need related to our products and services.

From website development to optimization, social media, online advertising and more, we&#x2019;ll have your business online in no time. A personalized business website is the first step to getting your business online. We provide everything from simple do-it-yourself builders to custom-built advanced websites with all the bells and whistles. That means you can choose the right website for your business and your budget. When building your online presence, it is also important that you factor in search engines and how people use them. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is one of the only ways people who don&#x2019;t already know your business can find it online. Without keywords and search engine optimization, customers and clients can only find you by searching for your exact business name or web address, or by searching on social media. That means you miss out on thousands of searches about your products and services every month that take place in Google, Bing etc. We provide SEO services for all different types of businesses to allow you to target local, national and international search engines. Once you have your website created and optimized for search engines, you need to look into digital marketing to amplify your online presence. When a new business goes online, it has to compete with older websites who have already worked to secure their space and ranking in the search engines. These websites once started where you are today but invested in marketing campaigns to find new customers. Without marketing, your potential customers have to do a lot of work to find your business. You are asking customers to search through all of the other businesses who do market themselves online and have been doing so for years, to find your company and use you. Online marketing can take many forms. For local businesses with a storefront, we recommend social media marketing to drive clientele to you. Online ratings, engagement, and multiple social accounts, factor in to your overall local presence and we can help with all of that. </p><p>For online businesses that need new customer leads now, we recommend Network Solutions Pay-Per-Click services that allow you to set aside a budget and advertise your business in the first one to four ad slots on Google. That means showing up at the top of search engine results pages today! Get in touch with our customer service to get your business online right away. </p> </li> </div>
