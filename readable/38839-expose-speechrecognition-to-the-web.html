As he said, I was working on the mochitests and also finding the root of a memory leak that occurs when closing the tabs while the microphone capture is in process.</p><p>If the ultimate goal is to integrate Deep Speech, I believe a better use for Alex' time would be to work in the backend instead the frontend being discussed here, since they should be totally decoupled, i.e, finish the docker containing deepspeech and deploy it to Mozilla's services cloud infrastructure, for online decoding, and/or, create another bug and patch just to integrate deepspeech's inference stack and models into gecko, plus the HTTP service which will receive the requests from the frontend here, in the case of offline.</p><p>Both are still missing and currently needs more attention than the patch being worked here, which is already functional if manually applied to Gecko.</p></div></div></div></div>
