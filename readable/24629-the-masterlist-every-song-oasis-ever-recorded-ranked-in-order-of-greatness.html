Definitely! Every song Oasis ever recorded ranked in order of greatness</p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">It was, I think, my friend Hamish who I once spent some time pondering the improbability of a band like Oasis existing. You’ve got these two brothers, sharing a room in a council house in Manchester, in the late ’80s and early ’90s. There’s Noel, on the top bunk, oblivious to the fact that the annoying little twat underneath him is the best singer of his generation. There’s Liam, on the bottom bunk, oblivious to the fact that the annoying slightly older twat above him is the best songwriter of his generation. And then somehow, because of fate or luck or magic or witchcraft, they work it out, and they form Oasis. What, actually, are the chances of that happening? One in a million? One in a trillion? One in a billion? No idea. But thank God it did, because I have no idea who else would’ve guided me through life from my mid-teens onwards. It’s sad, obviously, that Liam and Noel don’t talk anymore. But look at everything they’ve done and said and sung and drunk and snorted and played and filmed and sold together. Maybe there’s only so much intensity one relationship can handle. Their legacy, though, is epic. Untouchable maybe. Except these very bottom ones, which we’re going to run through very quickly…</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>149/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Magic Pie (1997)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Most of the bad things people say about ‘Be Here Now’ are wrong or misunderstood (it’s too long! It’s overproduced! The songs are bad! Cocaine had a negative influence on the album!), apart from on ‘Magic Pie’, which is bobbins.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>148/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Heroes (1997) </b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dodgy cover of David Bowie’s finest moment that popped up as a ‘D’You&nbsp;Know What I Mean’&nbsp;b-side. Do not add to playlist.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span><span class="s1"><b>147/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Those Swollen Hand Blues (2009) </b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Oasis never ever, ever sounded more like The Beatles than they do on this largely pointless ‘Falling Down’ b-side. </span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>146/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Reminisce (1991)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Takes 1.33 minutes to get to Liam singing. Too long, baby,&nbsp;waaay&nbsp;too long.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>145/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The Quiet Ones (2005)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Gem Archer wrote it, Liam sung it, everyone forgot it.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>144/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The Nature Of Reality (2008)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Andy Bell’s post-divorce, post-therapy meditation on life, love and atheism. Squint and it sounds a bit like Liam doing new vocals for The White Stripes’ ‘Ball and Biscuit’, with Meg on drums and all.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>143/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>A Quick Peep (2002)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bleeeeuuuugh.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>142/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Waiting For The Rapture (2008)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bleeeeeeeeuuuuuuuuuugh.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>141/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Hung In A Bad Place (2002)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bleeeeeeeeeuuuuuuuuuuuuuugggggggggggh.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>140/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Merry Xmas Everybody (2002)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">A strangely joyless Slade cover. Come on Noel, it’s Christmas. Recorded for the charity album ‘NME In Association With War Child Presents 1 Love’, though, so it gets some For A Good Cause points. </span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>139/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>I Believe In All (2008)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">An unremarkable ‘Dig Out Your Soul’ bonus track for the Japanese edition. Possible prototype for ‘You Better Run’ from Liam’s ‘As You Were’, which is an updated and improved version.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>138/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>To Be Where There’s Life (2008</b>)</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some late era Oasis songs could do with being deleted. This, written by Gem Archer, has the lyric that inspired the title of the album it lives on: “<em>dig out your soul, cos here we go</em>”. Which is something, I suppose.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>137/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>(Get Off Your) High Horse Lady (2008)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">A slice of plodding honky-tonk that was originally demoed for 2002’s ‘Heathen Chemistry’ and six years later found its way onto ‘Dig Out Your Soul’. It’s possible it took Noel that long to realise how good it is. It’s also possible that by the time Oasis’ seventh and final album came along he wasn’t that arsed anymore.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>136/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Force Of Nature (2002)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Written for a the film <em>Love, Honor And Obey</em> starring Jude Law and Jonny Lee Miller, ‘Force Of Nature’ is a tune that rips the beat from Iggy Pop’s ‘Nightclubbing’ and everyone thinks is about NG’s ex-wife, because of lyrics like “<em>It’s all over town that the sun’s going down on the days of your easy life</em>”. But Noel says he’d never do anything so undignified.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>135/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>You’ve Got To Hide Your Love Away (1995)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Beatles cover. Probably seemed like a good idea at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>134/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>If We Shadows (1997)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Released in 2016 on the reissue of ‘Be Here Now’, ‘If We Shadows’ is hardcore acoustic Noel introspection, as a lot of his ‘97 tunes were. “<em>All the feelings I got inside / nobody knows what’s wrong,</em>” he goes, then: “<em>everything I do is wrong / but I always sing my song, in my own way</em>”. Never believe him when he says his lyrics don’t mean anything.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>133/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Who Put The Weight of The World On My Shoulders? (2005)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">A dreary little thing that, somehow, ended up on the soundtrack to the film <em>Goal!</em>. The violins from the 3.20 mark are quite good, to be fair.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>132/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Thank You For The Good Times (2002)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">No no no Oasis, thank <em>you</em>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>131/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>I Will Believe (1993)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Described as “shoegazer shit” by Dave Scott, the sound engineer at Oasis’ Pink Museum sessions in Liverpool in 1993. And his dim view of the song turned out to be a stroke of genius, as he talked the band into jamming a new instrumental instead, which swiftly turned into ‘Supersonic’. </span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>130/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Hey Hey My My (2000)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Noely G is a long-standing Neil Young fan, and so it was that Young’s ‘Hey Hey My My’ was played 34 times on the ‘Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants’ tour, and officially released on their live album ‘Familiar To Millions’. “<em>Hey hey my my, rock ‘n’ roll</em><em>will never die</em>” is a very Oasis mantra, but this jam is laboured and strained.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>129/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Sunday Morning Call (2000)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">One of two long, bleak and pessimistic Noel-sung tunes on Oasis’ fourth album ‘Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants’ (the other: ‘Where Did It All Go Wrong?’) about which, Noel once said, “people who used to always turn up on my fucking doorstep, at ungodly hours of the morning – proper well-off rich, famous people – and run you through their drug and booze and hell… and you’ll be going, ‘Get a grip of yourself, man.” After the euphoria of everything the band did, said, released and recorded in the mid-late ‘90s, both were a bit of a shock. That’s what kicking a hearty cocaine habit will do to ya.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>128/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Where Did It All Go Wrong? (2000)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">See above!&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>127/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Part Of The Queue (2005)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Aka the one that sounds like ‘Golden Brown’ by The Stranglers.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>126/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>See The Sun (1991)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Guigsy’s&nbsp;finest moment. Ignore how much of a Stone Roses rip-off this is, and let the pure vibes of his bass guitar flow through you.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>125/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Comin’ On Strong (1992/1993)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">In ‘92/’93 Oasis recorded a woozy and punky demo called ‘Comin’ On Strong’ with Liam on vocals which, in 1996, became a woozy and dance-y Chemical Brothers song called ‘Setting Sun’ with Noel on vocals. The vibes are very different but, impressively, the vocal melody shines brightly on both, and is the best thing about each track.</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>124/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>My Sister Lover (1997)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">‘Stand By Me’ B-side that was bumped off ‘The Masterplan’ for ‘Going Nowhere’. Correct. Confusingly, a demo version was first recorded in ‘92 and called ‘Lock All The Doors’, which Noel then rejigged and re-released as a High Flying Birds single in 2015. It’s done the rounds.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>123/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Full On (2000)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">This, you suspect, was the song that became ‘You Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is’. It’s a dark and doomy stomper, and it’s a hell of a lot better than the song it was a B-side for (‘Sunday Morning Call’). </span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>122/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>(Probably) All in The Mind (2002)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">I love Oasis more than I love my own children (probably a joke!), but there are some songs I just cannot be&nbsp;arsed&nbsp;with. This is a bad version of ‘Who Feels Love?’, which isn’t exactly a classic. Liam doesn’t even sound good on it. So what is the point? A fact, though: it was first demoed by Noel and Andy Bell immediately after they’d finished a session with Paul Weller for a track of his called ‘One Times One’.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>121/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Colour My Life (1992)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Stone Roses homage co-written by Liam and Bonehead. In a review of ‘Colour My Life’ in the Christmas 1991 issue of Manchester listing mag <em>City Life</em>, Liam was described as sounding “a bit nasally… sort of like Dermo [lead singer] from Northside [a baggy Manchester band around at the time]”. Needless to say, LG had the last laugh.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>120/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Alice (1991)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Liam wrote the words, Bonehead wrote the music, and I guess he’d been listening to The Smiths a lot. It’s quite charming, really: “<em>She always comes up smiling, and playing with her hair</em>.” Although Noel did describe it as “pish” in a 2001 interview with Sky Box Office. Probably just jealous.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>119/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Let There Be Love (2005)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Imagine this song without Liam singing it. Horrendous!&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>118/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>I Will Show You (1992)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">On which a 19-year-old Liam sounds every inch the Ian Brown fanboy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>117/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Take Me (1992)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">That bass! A little ripper of a Liam and Bonehead co-production, written before Noel joined the band. In a July ‘95 <em>Q</em> interview NG said he wished they’d record it, but they wouldn’t. Too busy getting&nbsp;wankered&nbsp;weren’t they.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>116/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Strange Thing (1993)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dear The Stone Roses. I love you. I have stolen John Squire’s guitar playing from the song ‘Love Spreads’. Hope that’s cool. Love Noel Gallagher.</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>115/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>A Bell Will Ring (2005)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">“The world’s as wide as your life is thin, so entertain your goals” is an amazingly – perhaps even admirably – bad lyric, but this Gem Archer jam has an otherwise trippy ‘Tomorrow Never Knows’ by The Beatles vibe.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>114/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Shout It Out Loud (2002)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Go straight to the two minute mark to hear Noel getting his Pink Floyd on. You can get away with that sort of thing on a B-side. </span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>113/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Must Be The Music (1992)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Trippy, rhythmical, danceable – a good warm up for ‘Columbia’.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>112/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Won’t Let You Down (2004)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Written by Liam, sung by Liam, acoustic guitar probably not played by Liam, but the lyrics are <em>very</em> Liam: “<em>Won’t you say? It’s time that you came out and played / Let’s get out of our minds, won’t waste your time</em>.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>111/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The Turning (2008)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">This, according to Noel in the October 2008 issue of <em>Q</em> magazine, is “The [Stone] Roses doing The Stooges with a nod to The World Of Twist.” That, plus the lyric “<em>shake your ragdoll, baby</em>”, make it worth exploring.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>110/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Turn Up The Sun (2005)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">The good thing about having Liam Gallagher in your band, is that even if the bassist writes a dodgy tune for your new album there’s every chance he’ll rock up in a good mood and save it with some quality vocals.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>109/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Ain’t&nbsp;Got&nbsp;Nothin’ (2008)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Written a few months after Liam’s 2002 bar brawl in Munich, ‘cos he was annoyed with everyone saying it was Oasis who started the fight in which he had two teeth knocked out: “<em>I don’t care what they say anymore, all I want is the truth</em>”. The six year delay in releasing it reduced its potency somewhat, but hey ho.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>108/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Mucky Fingers (2005)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yeah&nbsp;yeah, it’s ‘I’m Waiting For The Man’ by The Velvet Underground. And yeah&nbsp;yeah, it needs Liam on&nbsp;vox.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>107/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>I Can See A Liar (2000)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s pretty bad. Okay, it’s very bad. But one of the most intriguing things about Oasis around the year 2000 is that even though Noel’s songwriting had dipped a tad, Liam was still in his peak. Top hair, solid burns, good clobber, voice from the gods, made iffy tunes listenable on the regular. A prime example from <em>The David Letterman Show</em>:&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>106/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Help! (1998)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">John Lennon, 1980: “When ‘Help’ came out, I was actually crying out for help. I didn’t realise it at the time. I am singing about when I was so much younger and all the rest, looking back at how easy it was. I was fat and depressed and I was crying out for help.” Throughout January and February 1998 Noel played this Beatles cover 14 times, then kicked his cocaine habit later that year. Maybe he was trying to tell us something.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>105/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The Cage (2002)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Half an hour after ‘Better Man’ comes ‘Heathen Chemistry’’s very zen (and very ‘Fade In-Out’-y) instrumental secret track, ‘The Cage’. Five minutes later it ends, and your mood has probably improved. Strangely it made its way onto the ‘The Big Bash! NME Awards Nominations Album 2003’ alongside other year-defining classics such as ‘Supergyrations!’ by The Datsuns and ‘Sun Child’ by The Vines. Life is weird sometimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>104/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Put&nbsp;Yer&nbsp;Money Where Your Mouth Is (2000)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dodgy song with dodgy lyrics elevated somewhat by amazing vocals. Brilliantly, though, ‘PYMWYMI’ was used as the intro music for season six of the Canadian version of<em> Dragons’ Den</em>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>103/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Eyeball Tickler (2005)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s probably a coincidence that for 10-ish seconds this ‘Lyla’ B-side resembles ‘Fuck Forever’ by Pete Doherty’s Babyshambles, came out in the same year as it, and goes on to feature lyrics about a “<em>shocking junkie suckin’ on your veins</em>”, but you never know. I’m calling it: this is the best Oasis song Gem Archer ever wrote, and it would’ve rocked live.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>102/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Better Man (2002)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Liam’s idea was to write a song with a similar groove to John Lennon’s ‘I Don’t Want To Be A Soldier’, and you know what? Decent effort.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>101/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Sittin’ Here In Silence (On My Own) (2005)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">There’s a bit in the 2016 <em>Supersonic</em> film where Noel explains they ways in which he is a cat, and Liam is a dog: “Cats are very independent creatures, they don’t give a fuck. Right bastards. Dogs, it’s just fucking, ‘Play with me, play with me, please fucking throw that ball for me. I need some company.’ It’s as basic as that. I’m a cat, OK. That’s just what I am.” This, like ‘Talk Tonight’ or ‘Going Nowhere’, is a Noel Is A Cat song: playing on his own, singing about being on his own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>100/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Helter&nbsp;Skelter&nbsp;(2000)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">IMHO Noel Gallagher’s voice does not sound good when he is shouting. If only he knew a guy who was brilliant at that sort of thing…&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>99/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Alive (1993)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Undeniably charming, if only for how young Liam sounds. The guitar work at 3.30 is absolutely classic Noel.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>98/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Carry Us All (2000)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Hidden away as a ‘Sunday Morning Call’ B-side, ‘Carry Us All’ seems to be a pep talk from born-to-Irish-Catholics Noely G to believe in yourself, rather than a God of any kind. “<em>Everybody’s gone for quick, sure fire solution / But faith in any god will only bury us all</em>”, he goes. “<em>No-one’s gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution /Have faith in what you’ve got and it will carry us all</em>”, he continues. Worked out pretty well for him, didn’t it.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>97/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>You’ve Got The Heart Of A Star (2002)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">A theory: could this slow, warm acoustic ‘Songbird’ B-side be about the eldest Gallagher, Paul, and how strange life must be for him?

When I hear it I imagine a guy with a big fucking rope and lump of concrete on his back: as if someone has told him right – there’s your baggage.

But Noel is tough and Noel is wise, so he gets his shit together: <em>“You’re not cracking up, you’re just getting older</em>”. As if to prove the power of the message, YouTube commenter GamingTutor writes: “This song saved my life.

Here he is speaking to <em>Q</em> in September 1997: “You guessed it. Meg is the girl in the dirty shirt. We were doing a gig in Brighton, just before Meg and me were going out. She was at the hotel ironing a dirty shirt because she hadn’t brought enough clothes with her. I know it sounds a bit soft. Liam will read this and say, You fucking wanker! Because he thinks all the songs are about him. He even thinks Wonderwall is about him.” So songs like ‘The Girl In The Dirty Shirt’ get sort of forgotten, because Oasis never played them. Tune though.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>66/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Take Me Away (1993)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Solo Noel, acoustic, in the style of his heroes Burt Bacharach and Harry Nilsson, singing about a better life: “<em>cos me and my soul we know where we’re going / we’re going where the grass is free, the air is clean and the good times are growing</em>.” Classic early NG.

Liam gives it some necessary edge, and NG gets his very best Pink Floyd on at the 3.15 mark.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>64/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Little James (2000)</b>[Text Wrapping Break]Liam Gallagher. For much of the mid-late ‘90s, a man both celebrated and despised for his wild, reckless, loutish&nbsp;behaviour, and a man who was not necessarily known for having a caring side, or for handling the big emotions well. ‘Little James’. A song written by said man for and about his stepson James, and his then-wife Patsy&nbsp;Kensit. There is a lot of heart, love and soul in this song, and there is a lot of //gratitude// in this song. He loved that kid. You can hear it.

(1992)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">At some point in 1992 Noel and Liam went round to future Oasis producer Mark Coyle’s house in Manchester to record some demos, and this Noel-sung classic came out. “<em>It’s funny how your dreams change as you’re growing old / You don’t wanna be no spaceman, you just want gold / All the dream stealers are lying in wait, but if you wanna be a spaceman it’s still not too late</em>.” Believe. Liam does, and made the strange but brilliant decision to include it in some of his live shows in 2018.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>41/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Sad Song (1994)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Noel-sung original has only had one official release, on the vinyl edition of ‘Definitely Maybe’ – between ‘Columbia’ and ‘Supersonic’ – so still feels a bit of hidden treasure. Unfortunately for Noel – who once said “it’s my voice on there because Our Kid could never sing a song like that” – a cut with Liam singing emerged in 2016 with the <em>Supersonic</em> film. Both versions are good, but come on:&nbsp;</span></p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSEnaWqxrd0</p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>40/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Going Nowhere (1997)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Written, the story goes, in 1990, but not released until a B-side was needed for ‘Stand By Me’. Slots into Noel’s canon of quietly optimistic and ambitious early tunes, sung by him: “<em>I’m gonna get me a motor car, maybe a Jaguar, maybe a plane or a day of fame / I’m gonna be a millionaire so can you take me there, wanna be wild cos my life’s so tame</em>.” It’s impressive, really, that every single one of these dreams came true.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>39/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Roll With It (1995)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Famous because of the Oasis vs Blur / ‘Roll With It’ vs ‘Country House’ dustup and obviously a //crucial// stepping stone on the band’s journey to world domination, but really, one of the weakest tracks on ‘What’s The Story (Morning Glory)’. Best appreciated by watching LG and NG do a job swap while performing it on TOTP, in August ‘95:&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>38/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Underneath The Sky (1996)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Noel plays the high piano parts (with his left hand, ‘cos he’s left-handed), Bonehead plays the low ones (with his right hand, ‘cos he’s right-handed), and Liam puts in a vintage performance. One highlight is the way he delivers “and as we drink to ourselves we’ll amuse ourselves”, but the best bit is when he pronounces the final word of the song “<em>againnnnna</em>”.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>37/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Rockin’ Chair (1995)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bumped off ‘(What’s The Story)…’ in favour of ‘Wonderwall’, and rarely played live because Liam struggled with the chorus. It’s a lovely little thing, though, and has a good diss in it: “<em>I don’t care for your attitude, you bring me down I think you’re rude</em>.” A difficult line to get out of your head if you are ever faced with a particularly troublesome adversary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>36/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Let’s All Make Believe (2000)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Why wasn’t it on ‘Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants’?

Then recorded in Texas after forgiving Liam for doing all that crystal meth and&nbsp;twatting&nbsp;Noel over the head with a tambourine. It’s good that you can hear Noel take his watch off before he starts playing, it’s even better that you can hear him cough to clear his throat and it’s quite frankly wonderful that he did this sad but soulful slice of acoustic magic in two takes, and two hours. Says Owen Morris, who produced it: “Then the rest of the band turned up and Noel was like, “Haha&nbsp;we’ve already recorded the track without you&nbsp;you&nbsp;wankers.”&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>28/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Half The World Away (1994)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">On which Noely G gets inspired by Burt Bacharach and Hal David’s ‘This Guy’s In Love With You’, plays the drums all by himself and and finds a melody for the ages to carry some despairing lyrics: “<em>And when I leave this island, I’ll book myself into a soul asylum</em>”.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>27/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Step Out (1996)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Until early 2019, ‘Step Out’ was best known as the Noel-sung belter that didn’t make it onto ‘(What’s The Story) Morning Glory’ because Stevie Wonder was prepping his suits to get heavy on NG’s generous borrowing from the chorus of his tune ‘Uptight’. But then a clip emerged of Liam belting it out and now it’s nothing short of an apocalyptic fucking tragedy that this isn’t a bona-fide grade-A gold-rimmed generation-defining Oasis classic.

The only song from ‘Definitely Maybe’, really, that is overtly political “<em>Is it worth the aggravation to find yourself a job when there’s nothing worth working for?</em>“.

This is a contender. That chorus is so pure, so Noel, so brilliantly executed by his brother: “<em>Sailing down a river alone, I’ve been tryin’ to find my way back home / But I don’t believe in magic, life is automatic / But I don’t mind being on my own</em>.” Throw Liam’s voice breaking under the strain at the 1.20 and you’ve got something very special indeed.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>23/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>(It’s Good) To Be Free (1994)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">A report from Marty Lester, the assistant studio engineer at The Congress House Studio in Austin, Texas, where ‘(It’s Good) To Be Free’ was recorded: “[Liam was] ranting like a maniac for much of the first day, which I thought was hilarious eve though I only understood about 10 per cent of what he was saying. I believe most of his venom was spat in the direction of the obviously shoddy drummer [Tony McCarroll].” Poor Tony McCaroll who, actually, sounds light as a feather here.</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>22/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Fade In-Out (1997)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Johnny Depp played slide guitar on the album version, and blah blah blah. But as with many ‘Be Here Now’ songs, it’s true majesty can be found in the live versions. 1997 was one of the years when Liam Gallagher’s voice was at its absolute peak, and able to turn solid-to-good album tracks into something quite extraordinary. </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>21/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>D’You Know What I Mean?

Oasis are by far and away the biggest band in UK and people are <em>desperate</em> for new music. ‘D’You Know What I Mean?’ drops on July 7. The excitement is palpable. It becomes Oasis’ biggest selling UK single, and the lead single for ‘Be Here Now’, which is <em>still</em> the fastest selling UK album of all time. This tune is seismic. This tune is historic. This tune, as LG might say, is biblical. “<em>All my people right here right now, d’you know what I mean?</em>” Yeah we do, yeah.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>20/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Round Are Way (1995)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Is this the most charming Oasis song of all?

It possibly features the meanest Oasis lyric ever (“<em>lost at sea? Well I hope that you drown</em>”) and while people moan about it being too long (9.20 minutes, actually, it’s not long enough.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>18/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Wonderwall (1995)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">It was <em>NME</em>’s Senior Staff Writer Jordan Bassett who put to me the theory that ‘Wonderwall’, above all other Oasis songs, is where we hear the genius of Liam’s emotional intelligence. Give it to Ed Sheeran or Bastille or James Bay and you end up something icky. Chuck it to LG and you get a love song full of threat, longing, trepidation, disbelief, commitment, confusion and pain, just like actual love is. Didn’t get to Number One in the charts though, thanks to the rarely bettered creative might of Robson &amp; Jerome’s split single ‘I Believe’ and ‘Up On The Roof’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>17/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>I Am The Walrus (1994)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">The essential Oasis cover.

Ladies and gentlemen it’s ‘Gas Panic!’, of course, Noel’s best trying-to-kick-cocaine tune.

Fun fact: it was recorded at the same time as ‘Listen Up’, ‘Whatever’ and a demo of ‘Some Might Say’ at the Maison Rouge studio in Chelsea. What a week! Another fun fact: for a while there, Noel was worried he was gonna get sued for ‘Fade Away’ because it sounds a bit like the Wham! Song ‘Freedom’. George Michael was always too cool for that sort of behaviour though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>12/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Rock N Roll Star (1994)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">The song that defines Liam’s entire existence.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>11/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Bring It On Down (1994)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">August 9, 1994. Oasis are playing the Riverside in Newcastle. They’re part of the way through ‘Bring It On Down’ when some lunatic jumps on stage and boffs Noel in the head.

And he’ll sweat like a fucking madman, and it’s fucking genius what he does. But when you try and get him to build something up from really quiet, forget about it.” And it makes.

That string section. That chorus. That violin breakdown. And have you ever in your life heard lyrics as reassuring or aspirational as “<em>I’m free to be whatever I choose, and I’ll sing the blues if I want</em>” and “<em>I’m free to say whatever I like, if it’s wrong or right it’s alright</em>”?&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>7/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Columbia (1994)</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">If Oasis ever reunite (they won’t) they’ve gotta open with this, because of these 15 words that sum up the Gallagher plight: “<em>There we were, now here we are / all this confusion, nothing’s the same to me</em>”. And also, nostalgia heads, because it was the first song they played at their first ever gig, at the Manchester Boardwalk on October 19, 1991.

Me? I can’t listen to ‘Champagne Supernova’ without crying. Because of the lyrics, mostly, which I’ve been getting wrong for almost two decades now (“<em>but you and I we’ll never die</em>” instead of “<em>but you and I, we live and die</em>”), and because of that magical Oasis mix of nostalgia, optimism, hope, glory, sadness, longing, the passage of time – all the good stuff. The sound of the sea gently sloshing in the intro is enough to turn my waterpipes on. Liam’s take on it is good too: “It just reminds me of getting pissed, in a big-style way, and fucking having loads of fucking drugs.” What a guy.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>3/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Acquiesce (1995)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">‘Acquiesce’ is sacred because, as things stand at 1505 on Friday May 10, neither Gallagher has performed it as a solo artist. This means something, because both of them have used gigs to send messages. Noel, for example, opening shows with ‘(It’s Good) To Be Free’ when he first went solo. Liam, for example, singing ‘Don’t Look Back In Anger’ – without a shadow of a doubt, Noel’s song – at Glastonbury in 2017. Obviously the problem with ‘Acquiesce’ for both of them is that they share the vocals, and they’d have to find a way round that. But it wouldn’t be that hard, would it, for Noel to sing all the parts, or for Liam to get the crowd involved for Noel’s chorus. So the romantic in me is happy to believe that ‘Acqueisce’ will only ever get played live again on an Oasis reunion tour. “<em>Because we need each other / We believe in one another</em>,” and so on. They’re saving it for the big one. And my oh my that would be quite something. Best B-side ever? Probably.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>2/</b>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Live Forever (1994)</b></span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">It was, when it came out as a single four months after Kurt Cobain killed himself, an incredibly powerful message, and it remains that way. It is about you, the underdog, harnessing the powers of positivity, optimism and self-belief to achieve whatever you want to achieve (“<em>maybe I just wanna fly / wanna live and don’t wanna die</em>”). It is a fuck you to the people running this world, who think they can tell you what you can and can’t do (“<em>we’ll see things they’ll never see</em>”). It is a rejection of the banal and the mediocre (“<em>maybe I don’t really wanna know, how your garden grows / and I just wanna fly</em>”), and a celebration of just how magnificent human beings can be (“<em>maybe I will never be, all the things that I wanna be / now is not the time to cry, now’s the time to find out why</em>”). It is awesome. And I’m pretty sure that when, in my GCSE English Literature class, I was asked to do a talk about something I loved and I played ‘Live Forever’ from Maine Road in its entirety on the TV at the front of the room, even the teacher knew he was in the presence of greatness.

It also just so happens to be a perfectly crafted rock song that doesn’t relent for even half a second, sung by an intensely passionate human being who believes every word he’s singing, and who let this song take him to his absolute peak. There is a moment, 3.44 minutes into this vid from the second night of Oasis’ epic ‘96 Knebworth shows, where Liam sings the words “<em>NOW THAT YOU’RE MINE</em>” so powerfully it knocks his whole body backwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">I watch that, and I think: has any frontman ever been better than that?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div>
