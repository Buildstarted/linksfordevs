			<p>Last week at Microsoft Build, there have been a <em>lot</em> of exciting annoucements! .NET 5, Blazor WebAssembly, .NET MAUI, WinUI… But the thing I'm most eager to get my hands on is C# 9, which introduces <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/Language%20Feature%20Status.md">many interesting new features</a>, so let's take a quick tour! There's a long list, so I won't cover all of them here, but I will highlight the ones I find the most interesting.</p>
<p><em>Note: Unfortunately the new C# features aren't supported yet in the latest SDK preview, so we can't test them in actual projects. Some features can be tried in <a href="https://sharplab.io/">SharpLab</a>, but things are moving fast, so the bits available in SharpLab don't always reflect what has been announced at Build.</em></p>
<h2 id="target-typed-new">Target typed <code>new</code></h2>
<p>In C# 9, it will be possible to omit the type in object creation expressions, if the type can be inferred from the context, making code terser and less repetitive:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>private</span> Dictionary&lt;<span>string</span>, <span>object</span>&gt; _properties = <span>new</span>();
</code></pre></div><h2 id="parameter-null-checking">Parameter null-checking</h2>
<p>This feature introduces a simple syntax to automate null checks on method parameters. For instance, this code :</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>public</span> <span>string</span> SayHello(<span>string</span> name)
{
    <span>if</span> (name == <span>null</span>)
        <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> ArgumentNullException(nameof(name));
    <span>return</span> <span>$"Hello {name}"</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>Can be simplified to this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>public</span> <span>string</span> SayHello(<span>string</span> name!) =&gt; <span>$"Hello {name}"</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>!</code> after the parameter name automatically inserts a null check for that parameter.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-matching-improvements">Pattern matching improvements</h2>
<p>C# 9 comes with a few improvements to pattern matching. The most useful, in my opinion, is the <code>not</code> pattern, which lets you write code like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>if</span> (foo <span>is</span> not <span>null</span>) { ... }
<span>if</span> (animal <span>is</span> not Dog) { ... }
</code></pre></div><p>Relational (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, etc.) and logical operators (<code>and</code> and <code>or</code>) can also be used in pattern matching:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>return</span> size <span>switch</span>
{
    &lt; <span>1</span><span>0</span> =&gt; <span>"small"</span>,
    &gt;= <span>1</span><span>0</span> and &lt; <span>1</span><span>0</span><span>0</span> =&gt; <span>"medium"</span>,
    _ =&gt; <span>"large"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><h2 id="records-and-with-expressions">Records and <code>with</code> expressions</h2>
<p>This is the big one, in my opinion. Creating simple data types in C# have always been more painful than it should be; you have to create a class, declare properties, add a constructor if you want your type to be immutable, override <code>Equals</code> and <code>GetHashCode</code>, maybe add a deconstructor, etc. C# 7 tuples made this a little easier, but still not ideal since a tuple is anonymous. The new Record feature in C# 9 makes things <em>much</em> easier!</p>
<p>For instance, a simple class representing a point might look like this, if you implement equality, deconstructor, etc.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Point</span> : IEquatable&lt;Point&gt;
{
    <span>public</span> Point(<span>int</span> x, <span>int</span> y) =&gt;
        (X, Y) = (x, y);

    <span>public</span> <span>int</span> X { <span>get</span>; }

    <span>public</span> <span>int</span> Y { <span>get</span>; }

    <span>public</span> <span>bool</span> Equals(Point p) =&gt;
        (p.X, p.Y) == (X, Y)

    <span>public</span> <span>override</span> <span>bool</span> Equals(<span>object</span> other) =&gt;
        other <span>is</span> Point p &amp;&amp; Equals(p);

    <span>public</span> <span>override</span> <span>int</span> GetHashCode() =&gt;
        (X, Y).GetHashCode();

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Deconstruct(<span>out</span> <span>int</span> x, <span>out</span> <span>int</span> y) =&gt;
        (x, y) = (X, Y);
}
</code></pre></div><p>In C# 9, using the Records feature, the above class can be reduced to this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>public</span> data <span>class</span> <span>Point</span>(<span>int</span> X, <span>int</span> Y);
</code></pre></div><p>Yup, just one line, and not even a long one! How great is that? Note that it also works with structs, if you need a value type.</p>
<p>Note that records are immutable: you can't change the values of their properties. So if you want to modify an instance of a record type, you need to create a new one (this should be familiar, since the same is true of dates and strings, for instance). The current approach would be to do something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp">Point p1 = <span>new</span> Point(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>);
Point p2 = <span>new</span> Point(p.X, <span>3</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Basically, copy all properties from the original instance, except the ones you want to change. In this case, it's OK because there are only 2 properties, but it can quickly become annoying when there are many properties.</p>
<p>C# 9 introduces <code>with</code> expressions, which let you do this instead:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp">Point p1 = <span>new</span> Point(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>);
Point p2 = p1 with { Y = <span>3</span> };
</code></pre></div><p>A <code>with</code> expression makes a clone of the original object, with the modified properties specified between curly brackets.</p>
<p>There are several sub-features related to records (e.g. init-only properties), that I won't cover here. Check out <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/welcome-to-c-9-0/">Mads Torgersen's article</a> for a more in-depth description.</p>
<h2 id="target-typed-conditionals">Target-typed conditionals</h2>
<p>There's a small thing that has been annoying C# developers for years: when using the conditional operator (also known as “ternary”), there must be a type conversion from one side to the other. For instance, this code doesn't compile:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp">Stream s = inMemory ? <span>new</span> MemoryStream() : <span>new</span> FileStream(path);
</code></pre></div><p>Because there's no conversion between <code>MemoryStream</code> and <code>FileStream</code>. To fix it, one side has to be explicitly cast to <code>Stream</code>.</p>
<p>In C# 9, the code above will be allowed, if both sides are convertible to the target type (in this case, <code>Stream</code>).</p>
<h2 id="covariant-return">Covariant return</h2>
<p>Currently, when you override a method from a base class, the overriding method <strong>must</strong> return the same type as the base class method. In some situations, it would be more practical to return a more specific type. C# 9 makes this possible by allowing overriding methods to return a type that derives from the base method's return type:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Thing</span>
{
    <span>public</span> <span>virtual</span> Thing Clone() =&gt; <span>new</span> Thing();
}

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>MoreSpecificThing</span> : Thing
{
    <span>// Override with a more specific return type
</span><span></span>    <span>public</span> <span>override</span> MoreSpecificThing Clone() =&gt; <span>new</span> MoreSpecificThing();
}
</code></pre></div><h2 id="top-level-statements">Top-level statements</h2>
<p>This feature aims to reduce boilerplate code for simple programs. Currently, even the simplest program needs a class with a <code>Main</code> method:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>using</span> System;

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Program</span>
{
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span>"Hello world"</span>);
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This just adds noise, and make things confusing for beginners. C# 9 will make it possible to omit the <code>Program</code> class and <code>Main</code> method, so that the code above can be simplified to this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>using</span> System;
Console.WriteLine(<span>"Hello world"</span>);
</code></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Most of the features introduced by C# 9 are relatively small ones, designed to make code simpler, less cluttered and more readable; they're very convenient, but probably won't change how we write code in a very fundamental way. Records are another story, though; they make it much easier and less painful to write immutable types, which I hope will encourage developers to take advantage of immutability whenever possible.</p>
<p>Note that the release of C# 9 is still a few months away, and things are still moving, so some of the features I mentioned in this post could be modified, postponed to a later version, or even abandoned completely.</p>
