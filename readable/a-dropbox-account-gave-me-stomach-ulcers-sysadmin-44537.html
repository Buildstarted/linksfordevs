<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-click-id="text"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>Anyone ever find that "thing" that no one wants to talk about and is secretly holding the company together with shoe string, bubble gum, and paper clips. It's usually found at 445 on a Friday before a major holiday and after it goes down a beat red senior executive is screaming to the heavens that there's going to be a second of Battle Stalingrad if we don't get this previously unknown and undocumented "thing" back online. You email the alleged domain expert only to see they are out office till 2099 so you email their manager only to get a bounce back message that they haven't worked here since Barracks first term. I recently found one of those "things".</p><p>It all started with an acquisition of another company we'll call them the insane asylum that basically makes software for our industry. I am going to vaguely say my company is in the manufacturer world and buying the software gave us a competitive advantage. Of course no senior executive thinks about the difficulties the IT teams are now faced with in a meager. The first sign of something being amiss is when me and my coworkers were provisioning laptops and computers for employees from the insane asylum and we asked for requirements for each department. Everything seems to be going fine until I see the request from the insane asylum's development team. They wanted 40 laptops each with 4 TB of storage, which is a hell of a lot for a work computer and could send them way over budget. I couldn't understand why they needed that much local storage so I called up the head of that department for an explanation and his team danced around why they need that much storage. I mean we pay for cloud services for a reason, basically we walked away with the team telling they would try to make it work with less storage but never elaborated on why they requested it in the first place. I walked away from that phone call confused and my co-worker who is Jamaican (not relevant except that he uses local colloquialisms that wind up being very funny later in this story) brought up that their behavior seemed bizarre like why on earth would they plead the fifth when we pressed them for questions, we're honestly just looking to help. But work was piling up and even though we hadn't been involved in the acquisition they had passed audit before we purchased them so I let it go.</p><p>Flash forward three months to present. 4'o clock on Friday I'm wrapping up some day to day security stuff, and getting ready for an amazon sales meeting. I make it point to freeze changes and projects in December. Everyone's on vacation and I don't want a major outage during the holidays. So I'm all prepared for a lull period until January 3rd. I was starting to get really annoyed with the insane asylum employees because they kept scheduling changes but always would pencil out 2 to 3 days of time to get everything done even basic maintenance without explaining why it was taking so long. I was beginning to think they had snails or something typing at the computers. I was catastrophically wrong, my young Jamaican colleague was monitoring my ticket queue while I was in the sales meeting. He got an escalation request from help desk, its contents were literally</p><p>Something very weird is going on with the new dev team. Their app is suffering intermit outages, slow responses, and network monitoring says they are seeing that team trying to move GB's of data on the network. Call them ASAP.</p><p>My poor colleague calls the team and things really start to unravel they tell him many of the insane asylum old IT folks were let go during the acquisition including the guy who was responsible for increasing their storage when their app was close to hitting space capacity. They  had assumed we had been doing it in his place. No problem he could request a new virtual server or additional space in amazon to mitigate the problem right now and we could come up with a long term plan once I got back to my desk. The person he's talking too immediately cuts off and says that isn't necessary they just need him to call drop box support. He's now very confused and asks why on Earth are they sending or storing information in drop box that's a huge breach. He asks what information the app/website is pulling from the drop box and they drop a bombshell they tell him the entire database is in drobox. At this point I'm told he began to look like he just stumbled out of the trenches in 1917. He asked them to elaborate because what they described didn't sound possible. It was but it wasn't just the database it was the entire app and website. The app was actually just a server instance in Heroku that was spun up whenever there was an update and would make crazy api calls to the drop box account read information from hardcoded database files. He immediately called drop box support to figure out what in god's name was going on and to his horror after several escalations gained access to the account and found that the account had 497 TB of 500 TB space used up and the team was on the verge of running out. This explained why they needed such large hard drives and why they changes were taking so long it would take days to upload and download so much data  to drop box plus have all the devs resync their local drop box instances with the correct latest versions. This single drop box account was also their version control.</p><p>My colleague perhaps prophesying that a tsunami of shit was about to be unleashed started screaming the blood of Jesus, the blood of Jesus, lord no the blood of Jesus which might be the Caribbean equivalent of holy fucking shit. Unfortunately, the CISO happened to be in the room and was concerned why one of her employees was having a break down or if she should start preparing for the second coming. Usually I look to put together bullet points and work actions before contacting the CISO in an emergency because she often doesn't see the nuances of day to day operations. When this was all explained to her from street level her head exploded. Meanwhile I'm falling asleep in a meeting completely ignorant of the impending hurricane of shit I'm about to walk into until an analyst stormed into the meeting like Pheidippides right before he collapsed after the battle of marathon. He told us there was a potential privacy breach the CISO was already aware without being briefed and on top of everything else since the technical leads were in this doomed sales meeting all the zoo animals were let loose in the office. My blood runs cold and we all rush downstairs to a three ring political circus, our CISO is trying to justify to the CFO and the insane asylum employees that this is unacceptable even if we get this back online and increase the drop box storage this is a ticking bomb and we need to start an emergency investigation to see if anyone former employee or hacker has accessed this drop box account. There is zero monitoring in place and they were sharing accessing willy nilly with the whole team. Every team member had read/write access. Weary of losing this political battle and forcing her team to support this beast she went with the nuclear option and emailed the general counsel explaining the risks. This is when shit really started to roll because she interrupted the lovercraftian cosmic horror otherwise known as general counsel's vacation to lob this turd grenade. I spent of all night coming up for a solution to migrate all this information  and try to confirm that there hasn't been a data breach yet. I would have been working the following morning as well but I was in so much pain when I woke up on top of having anxiety nightmares the whole night, I went to the doctor and found out I have a stomach ulcer I can't be certain but I'm pretty sure this whole incident plus intervention from IT demons pushed my body over the edge.  The solution is yet to be determined it’s a miracle I haven't shot a developer yet.</p><p>There's a lot of lessons to unpack here but to this day it blows my mind what glue stick and  thumb tact solutions are in production. I'm concerned there are tons of companies out there were the standard operating procedure is too have stuff collecting  electricity without anyone knowing what it is or how it works.</p><p>P.S. my son said I should write that I'm hopping my fellow IT veterans pour one out for me this weekend.</p><p>*****Update number 1*****</p><p>1.We are paying to upgrade the storage in drop box I am not happy about this but we're not going to win friends for this battle if we come off as mules unwilling to offer a solution.</p><p>2. The cost of this much drop box storage is tens of thousands. I just found this out via an email  but the CFO is not clear in the message if its per year or per month (more unlikely)</p><p>3.  We are having four people work over the weekend to go through the data and understand whats going on. (You better believe they are making time and half)</p><p>4. I'm concerned there was data leak or breach and so is legal. We are still putting together a way to track who accessed what historically. I'm praying we don't find anything malicious.</p><p>5. If its a situation were we don't any historical information or logs. Legal is considering accepting that we can't assume integrity and will send a notice to customers.</p><p>6. Audit has some explaining todo.</p><p>7.  I'm taking a few days to deal with my ulcer and get an abscess in mouth cleared up (may have been a result of the ulcer) . This problem is not  going to be magically programmed away so I fully expect it to be waiting for me when come back to the office in a few days.</p><p>8. My email and phone are ringing off the chain</p><p>****Update number 2*****</p><ol><li><p>I feel bad because peoples holidays are begin interrupted but a shit show is never convenient.</p></li><li><p>Upping the storage has not resolved all the issues and were still on high alert.</p></li><li><p>Two of our senior devs not insane asylum employees (also making time and half one of the gave up a vacation day) are getting involved to start documenting this mess this is  not my cup of tea  I don't make web applications so this is over mine and some of the security staffs head.</p></li><li><p>Both Devs can't believe they did this. One is only 26 or 27 and can't believe in this day age someone would think this is a proper version control system. The older colleague is from the Soviet Union and told us the only shit storm he remember even being remotely as bad was when he in university/army service right as communism was falling apart and he had to work with a computer in Russian, software written in his local language, and software guides written in English. Longest year and half of his life apparently.</p></li></ol><p>****Update Number 3*****</p><ol><li><p>The soviet has come up with a plan I just spoke to him over the phone a few hours ago. He already got the storage increased but thats doesn't fix all the other issues. He's going to freeze updates and have people download the latest version of each file manually onto a virtual server then commit this to a private git repo. This is an extremely time consuming and tedious annoying task but it will get the job done god help the poor folks that draw the short straw on this assignment.</p></li><li><p>We have a post mortem /come to Jesus moment with this dev team on Monday. I will not be attending as I'm sick but the Soviet, the CISO, and my manager the head of IT operations, and a very technical associate will be there to get a lay of the land. The Soviet also told me if there is push back or if they start getting cold on giving him direct access to the drop box instance he's going to shoot someone (I don't think he's kidding) he had to work on a Saturday because of these people.</p></li><li><p>My Jamaican co-worker is fine  he'd probably get a kick out of everyone's concern. But people tend to overreact/ get worked up when security is involved.</p></li><li><p>Investigation is on-going there is some serious concerns. This companies old IT ticketing system was turned off / decommissioned  I jumped through hoops to get the archive out of a landfill. Apparently they have an IT ticket from a year half ago where an ex employee tried to delete files which is concerning not a big concern but trying to figure out if for instance an employee left the building after downloading dropbox files to their home computer is ongoing. There is a lot of security implications to unpack.</p></li><li><p>It appears to be an enterprise drop box account this is unconfirmed but  a consumer account I hope wouldn't be possible. What concerns is that some people were all using the same account the drop box instance and others created accounts and shared access with those accounts. People never cease to amaze.</p></li><li><p>The devs also told me there is some serious hackery going on with these web app  it probably has a bunch of vulnerabilities but beside that it has not just flat csv files its querying for info but also fully functional sqlite database which probably accounts for the poor performance on top of everything else they implemented sqlite incorrectly.</p></li></ol><p>****Update Number 4*****</p><ol><li><p>I think one day perhaps I'll write an IT lessons learned / horror story collection book. I'm not sure if people would actually read it.</p></li><li><p>I do have more stories to share and I have glad certain seem to enjoy how I write but I do think this is should be a serious discussion board and tend to make my post more question/serious oriented. Even when I have a funny horror story I try to point out the serious implications and lessons learned. Not sure if there's a subreddit where my stream of consciousness musings would be a better fit.</p></li><li><p>Antibiotics make a world of difference when you have a stomach ulcer.</p></li></ol><p>****Final update*****</p><ol><li><p>The Soviet has not shot anyone</p></li><li><p>Keep in mind I keep all my rage pent up and than unleash it via writing. While all this was happening I kept a calm demeanor and just kept looking for solutions and not panicking. It makes a world a world of difference when trying to win people to the logical side. But keeping my frustrations too much has affected my health negatively I need to work on not taking things so seriously</p></li><li><p>Permanent solution will a bridge too far at least for another month or two and its the holidays right now. Everything is in git repo now and a transition to real solution is underway. The non soviet senior dev will be holding a psychology class on how this group all came to the conclusion that a 500 TB dropbox was a fine a solution.</p></li><li><p>We found things considered to be sensitive in the account were still working  through it with drop box to figure if it was</p></li><li><p>I will consider doing another  write up of the another ridiculous fire we are putting out that is still in progress. This has been a very difficult year for my company's IT staff I am glad its almost over.</p></li><li><p>I am considering writing up a short collection of my IT horror stories will need some time to consider it.</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div>
