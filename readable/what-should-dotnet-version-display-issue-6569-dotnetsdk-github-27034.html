Just tried it and it seems my memory is not what it was, since it has just one. To be fair though, both <code>node</code> and <code>python</code> display just their version on <code>--version</code>. To your other very good points, here is a summary reply (hope that works):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That's great. I would also consider improving what is displayed when dotnet is run with no arguments at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, we are working on fixing this as it is super confusing to have 3 distinct versions (host, tooling and fx) to have to contend with, 2 out of which have</p>
<blockquote>
<p>--info should include the runtime version. Please, somehow, think of something better to call it than "Microsoft .NET Core Shared Framework Host".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The host and the runtime are distinct components. <g-emoji alias="slightly_smiling_face" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f642.png">ðŸ™‚</g-emoji> The runtime version is not displayed anywhere, which is what <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/omajid/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/omajid">@omajid</a> is asking for (see response below on that)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's weird that dotnet --version, dotnet --info are affected by the global.json's "sdk". Ideally --info would show all your SDKs installed, somehow. Even if I had preview4 installed, but run dotnet --info in a directory which has a global.json SDK for preview2, it returns the preview2 version. This is technically right behavior, but it still doesn't seem quite right. I'm not aware of any other platforms like dotnet that do muxing like this, so I can't think of a better way to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we should leave it like this because that is the fastest way to check on what version you are and as you quite nicely said, it is <em>technically</em> correct behavior. We could see if a feature can be made at some point in the future that would list out the SDKs installed, but I'm not too sure if this is the way forward. Need to think on this.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm in favor of having this capability in the CLI, just not as part of the <code>--info</code> or <code>--version</code>. I was thinking of adding at some point a <code>--runtimes</code> switch, for example, that would list out all of the runtimes that are near your host. I guess I'm following the underlying need here which is to have an easy gesture to list out the runtimes that you have installed on the system, correct?</p>
