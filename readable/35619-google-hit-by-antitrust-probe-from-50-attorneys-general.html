    <p>&quot;It&apos;s an investigation to determine the facts,&quot; Paxton said during a press conference outside the US Supreme Court building in Washington, DC. &quot;Right now it&apos;s about <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tags/advertising/">advertising</a>, but the facts will lead where they lead.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p>The announcement was made by a small group of attorneys general included Paxton, Karl Racine of Washington, DC, and Doug Peterson of Nebraska. Paxton said his office will serve as the head of a leadership team for the investigation, which will meet about the probe every week. Each state can be as involved as it wants to be. &quot;It will be a very open process,&quot; Paxton said.</p><p>For now, the probe will focus on Google&apos;s dominance in digital advertising. But the attorneys general also hinted the investigation could become broader, extending to other businesses of Google&apos;s parent company, Alphabet. They mentioned smartphones and online video. (Google owns YouTube.) </p><p>Headlines have swirled recently about federal regulators clamping down on big tech, but a probe at the state level could also mean major headaches for Google. In the past, state attorneys general have taken on the&#xA0;<a href="https://www.stoel.com/services/litigation/attorney-general">tobacco and mortgage lending industries</a>, forcing reform in both.</p><p>Google is already in the regulatory spotlight. On Friday, the search giant said it had&#xA0;<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-confirms-doj-scrutiny-preps-for-investigation-from-states/">sent information</a></span>&#xA0;about its previous antitrust investigations to the US Department of Justice. The company also said it was prepping for similar questions from state attorneys general, as Monday&apos;s announcement loomed.&#xA0;</p><p>The broad participation by the attorneys general signals a powerful united front from the states -- with two notable exceptions: Alabama and California, where Google is headquartered. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall&apos;s office didn&apos;t respond to requests for comment. In a statement, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said, &quot;California remains deeply concerned and committed to fighting anticompetitive behavior. Regarding this investigation or any other, to protect the integrity of potential and ongoing investigations, we cannot provide comment.&quot;</p><p>In the past, though, California has shown a willingness to regulate the tech giants in its backyard. In February, during his state of the state speech, Gov. Gavin Newsom suggested imposing a &quot;<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/gov-newsom-california-is-ready-to-regulate-tech/">data dividend</a></span>&quot; that would charge tech companies for using residents&apos; personal information. &#xA0;</p><p>Google is the clear leader when it comes to digital advertising in the US, with more than 37% of the market, according to eMarketer. Facebook trails at No. 2 with more than 22%. But while Google has a commanding advantage, rivals like Amazon have chipped away at its lead in recent years. The e-commerce giant owns almost 9 percent of the market.&#xA0;</p><p>When it comes specifically to search advertising revenue, however, Google is the clear juggernaut. Google owns almost 75% of the search advertising market, according to eMarketer, while its nearest competitor, Microsoft, follows far behind at almost 7%.</p><h2>Big tech scrutinized&#xA0;</h2><p>Meanwhile, the government has ratcheted up scrutiny of the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/topics/tech-industry/">tech industry</a> as a whole. The Justice Department in July <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/department-of-justice-kicks-off-antitrust-review-of-tech-giants/">announced an antitrust probe</a> into the tech industry more broadly, targeting Google, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/apple/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tags/facebook/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tags/amazon/">Amazon</a>. Meanwhile, House Democrats in June <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/house-democrats-announce-antitrust-probe-of-facebook-google-tech-industry/">announced their own investigation</a> into tech giants, meant to explore whether the companies are engaging in &quot;anti-competitive conduct.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p>Reached for comment on Monday, Google only pointed to a <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-confirms-doj-scrutiny-preps-for-investigation-from-states/">statement Friday</a></span> by Kent Walker, senior vice president of global affairs, that acknowledged the antitrust scrutiny from the Justice Department and state attorneys general. &quot;We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so,&quot; Walker wrote. &quot;We look forward to showing how we are investing in innovation, providing services that people want, and engaging in robust and fair competition.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p>On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-hit-by-antitrust-probe-from-multiple-states/">announced a similar probe into Facebook</a></span>. The investigation -- which will involve other states including Florida, Colorado and Iowa -- will focus on &quot;Facebook&apos;s dominance in the industry and the potential anticompetitive conduct stemming from that dominance,&quot; James&apos; office said in a statement.&#xA0;</p><p>Google is no stranger to government investigations. Six years ago, the FTC wrapped up a probe of the company looking into allegations of search bias. The commission decided unanimously at the time that Google wasn&apos;t violating any antitrust laws.</p><p>Google has also faced antitrust pressures from regulators in Europe. In March, the search giant was <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-fined-1-7bn-for-abusive-online-ad-practices-in-the-eu/">hit with a $1.7 billion fine</a> from the European Commission for &quot;abusive&quot; online ad practices. The commission said Google exploited its dominance by restricting its rivals from placing their search ads on third-party websites.&#xA0;</p><p>Last year, the EU&apos;s executive arm fined Google a record $5 billion for unfair business practices around Android, its mobile operating system. The investigation focused on Google&apos;s deals with phone manufacturers, requiring them to preload specific Google apps and services onto Android phones.&#xA0;</p><p>On Monday, Google&apos;s rivals praised the move by state attorneys general to investigate the search giant.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;It is heartening to see the news today that nearly every state attorney general in the country has joined a historic and bipartisan investigation into these illegal and anticompetitive practices,&quot; Yelp&apos;s Luther Lowe, senior vice president of public policy, wrote on Monday. &quot;Yelp will continue to assist with this investigation in whatever way we can.&quot;</p><p>Originally published Sept. 9, 11:07 a.m. PT.<br><strong>Update, 12:33 p.m.:</strong> Adds comment from Yelp and digital advertising market stats. <strong>1:16 p.m.:</strong> Adds comment from the California attorney general and request for comment from the Alabama AG.&#xA0;</p>
