<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-click-id="text"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>Hello,</p><p>Just giving a heads up to what I and my doctor both considered a very fucked situation. I just spent a week in Japan, a country at high risk for COVID-19. I wore a mask and essentially tried to stay away from most touristy places (not my first time there), but trains and stations are still packed with people, so there's really not much you can do.</p><p>On arriving back to America (3 days ago), I developed a 102F fever, coughing, and aches. I went to a local hospital in Brooklyn's ER. I informed them of my travel, they provided me a mask, and redirected me to a private room and followed infection protocols (full face covers, gloves, aprons, etc.). I had a chest x-ray and testing for flu/cold/pneumonia/and about 25 other viruses. They all came back negative.</p><p>At this point, the hospital called the CDC requesting permission to perform the COVID-19 testing. The CDC denied the request on the ground that I did not have the most life-threatening symptoms: chest pain and shortness of breath. According to everything I read it's very likely not to have these symptoms if you're in your 30's and relatively healthy.</p><p>And... that was that. They discharged me, said I don't have Corona virus, since they didn't test me for it, and said I can ride the subway, return to work, do whatever I want.</p><p>Of course my doctor disagreed. She said I should treat myself as if I am infected. My partner is currently staying in a nearby hotel since we live in a studio apartment. I am choosing to perform a self-quarantine for 14 days. Fortunately I can work from home and my partner can deliver me groceries if I run out.</p><p>But I don't think that many people are aware of the fact that they're actively not testing people for COVID-19, even people who have travel history to high-risk places.</p><p><strong>Edit</strong>: To answer some standard questions.</p><p>Do I still have symptoms?</p><p>Yes, Fever is current 101.6 (as of a couple hours ago), aches, and a cough that is persistent. I'm taking Tylenol and drinking a lot of water.</p><p>Is this real?</p><p>It's as real as I said it is. I returned from Japan. I'm sick. The symptoms are similar to COVID19 and I was refused testing. You can believe whatever you want, I don't care.</p><p>You have the flu?</p><p>Well, not according to my screens I don't.</p><p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I've taken some media inquiries already.</p><p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> <a href="https://abc7ny.com/5974999/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank"><strong>https://abc7ny.com/5974999/</strong></a></p><p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> Answering some additional questions:</p><p>Didn't the CDC just change their guidance?</p><p>Yes, the CDC added Japan to the list of high-risk countries on Feb 27 (evening). I went to the hospital on Feb 27 (morning). I performed a virtual follow-up visit with an ER doctor Feb 28 at 7:00pm to go over my case with the updated guidance from CDC. According to that ER nurse since the hospital still can't hospitalize me based on my criteria, they can't test me. So effectively, there is no change.</p><p>Were you supposed to go to the ER?</p><p>I called up the ER before I went. Told them about my travel, symptoms, and suspicion. I asked the receptionist what the protocol was and they said just come to the ER. Similarly, I asked them how I should get home, and they said I was fine to take any transportation I would normally take.</p><p>Go to the media!</p><p>I have already been contacted by over 15 media organizations, so I can't respond to them all. If I have the strength and energy I wanted to do a couple local/national organizations. However, I'm only talking to organizations who can guarantee that they'll protect my privacy and take it seriously. I need to disclose a lot of personal information (hospital records/occupation/residence etc.) for them to verify and run my story. Also doing Skype interviews while chain coughing into a headset in my dirty room isn't my best weekend activity.</p></div></div></div></div>
