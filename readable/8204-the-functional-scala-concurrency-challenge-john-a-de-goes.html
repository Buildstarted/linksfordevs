Once too many requests to the service fail, the circuit breaker trips, and immediately fails all requests, until the circuit breaker has a chance to reset.</p><p>Circuit breakers not only protect external services from overload (giving them a chance to recover after failure), but they help conserve local resources (such as sockets, threads, and the like) that would otherwise be wasted on a lost cost.</p><p>As opposed to retry policies, which dictate how individual requests are retried, circuit breakers share global knowledge across a system, so different fibers can act more intelligently and in a coordinated fashion.</p><p>Circuit breakers are often modeled as having three states: open, closed, and half-open. The circuit breaker logic (possibly aided by configuration parameters) is responsible for transitioning between the states based on inspecting the status of requests.</p><p>At the ZIO workshop, exploring different possibilities for circuit breakers made me realize something: I <em>really</em> don’t like circuit breakers. I find the arbitrary nature of the number of states and the switching conditions deeply disturbing.</p><p>I think we can do better than circuit breakers, and have some fun while we’re at it! So in this post, I’m going to issue a challenge for all you fans of functional programming in Scala: build a better circuit breaker!</p><h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2><p>Instead of a circuit breaker, I want you to build a <em>tap</em>, which adjusts the flow of requests continuously through the tap.</p><p>The flow is adjusted based on observed failures that qualify (i.e. match some user-defined predicate).</p><p>If you want to use ZIO to implement the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tap</code>, then your API should conform to the following interface:</p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="cm">/**

Bonus points for demonstrating your knowledge of concurrency primitives, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ref</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Promise</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deferred</code>), and so forth.</p><h2 id="winners">Winners</h2><p>The main reason to work on this challenge is to explore solutions for concurrency in functional Scala. It’s a fun little project that will take you on a grand tour of modern, purely functional effect systems in Scala.</p><p>That said, I want to give you a little extra motivation to work on this problem!</p><p>If you post your code in a Gist so the whole world can learn from your solution, then I’ll both promote your solution, and buy you a drink next time we’re in the same city!</p><p>Finally, if your solution is among the top 1-3 I receive over the next 2 weeks, I’ll connect with you on LinkedIn and write a short, honest endorsement of your skills in functional Scala.</p><p>Ready?
