<p>This half, some of <a href="https://blog.iamhamy.xyz/posts/2020-h1-review/#looking-forward">my goals</a> are to raise money and awareness for climate change and to reduce my carbon footprint by 10%.</p>

<p>In the past I’ve done this by <a href="https://blog.iamhamy.xyz/posts/2019-q3-review/#eating-less-meat">changing my diet</a> and <a href="https://blog.iamhamy.xyz/posts/what-im-doing-to-help-the-amazon/">paying a carbon tax</a>. Recently I’ve been intrigued by the power of economic motivators as an agent of behavior change and particularly how I could utilize those motivators myself.</p>

<p>One thing I’ve been thinking about recently is to expand my personal carbon tax to help encourage myself to make better decisions and to make up for those decisions when I make a poor choice. Now I realize that such an endeavour has a limited blast radius - it only affects me and those behaviors I choose to monitor - but my hope is that this may serve as an example for others to follow and draw inspiration from. Further it may convince people that such a tax could be useful when levied on large corporations with the ability to create a much larger blast radius.</p>



<p>Currently I have a personal carbon tax of $10 / month. This happens regardless of what I do / think in any given month. This is good because it’s a passive, sustainable way to offset my carbon but is bad because it’s not enough to fully offset my carbon and doesn’t really teach me to be a better steward of the Earth.</p>

<p>One can create behavior change by matching up an unwanted behavior with a bad stimulus. An example of this is taking away the ability to watch TV from a teenager for missing curfew. In this example the unwanted behavior is missing curfew and the bad stimulus is removing TV time.</p>

<p>So in my case, the unwanted behavior is anything that is bad for the environment and seems reasonable not to do. The bad stimulus will be a tax. So the idea is that when I perform an unwanted behavior, I must, literally, pay the price for it.</p>

<p>This paradigm works on two fronts.</p>

<ol>
<li>I am taxed every time I do something bad for the environment, theoretically I’ll do less bad things for the environment</li>
<li>Carbon taxes help offset the carbon ‘badness’ of these actions, righting the wrong while I learn from it</li>
</ol>



<p>For this thought experiment I wanted to focus on two areas that had a high carbon footprint and that I could substantially change through my habits.</p>

<ol>
<li>food</li>
<li>transportation</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve slowly been making my diet more environmentally-friendly over the past few halves by cutting out red meat and eating more full vegetarian meals. Currently I consider myself poulcetarian (poultry + pesce + tarian) which means I eat chicken, fish, and veggies. I allow myself the occasional pig, cow, etc. and it’s here that I think I have the largest opportunity for behavioral change.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">EPA</a>, transportation accounts for 28.2% of America’s carbon emissions. I live in NYC and do a lot of walking, training, and bussing than I would in a city without as much walkability or public transportation, but I do do a fair amount of flying and Ubering in non-quarantine times and get a ton of deliveries in current quarantine times. It’s here that I think I have the largest opportunity for behavioral change.</p>



<p>I think the important thing for taxing is to ensure:</p>

<ol>
<li>the tax covers the carbon footprint of the behavior</li>
<li>it’s large enough to deincentivize the behavior</li>
<li>it’s easy to implement / remember</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="food">food</h2>

<p>I’ve done deep analyses in the past on food carbon emissions and there’s a lot out there already so I’m just going to keep this shallow using some Googled internet data.</p>

<p>Pulling data from:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/opinion/sunday/carbon-tax-on-beef.html">The Case for a Carbon Tax on Beef</a></li>
<li><a href="http://static.ewg.org/reports/2011/meateaters/pdf/methodology_ewg_meat_eaters_guide_to_health_and_climate_2011.pdf">Meat Eater’s Guide to climate change and health</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We get a food to CO2 hierarchy measured in emissions kg of CO2 / kg of product something like this (in descending order):</p>

<ul>
<li>lamb - 20.44</li>
<li>beef - 15.5</li>
<li>cheese - 9.82</li>
<li>chicken - 5.00</li>
<li>pork - 4.9</li>
<li>salmon - 4.5</li>
<li>milk 2.5</li>
<li>eggs - 2.4</li>
</ul>

<p>The US doesn’t have a carbon tax and <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/SDN/background-note_carbon-tax.pdf">country taxes vary widely</a> so I had to be a little creative to find a good tax rate. I ended up going with Canada cause it was easy and they seem kinda like the better US. This also means I may need to revisit these calculations in the future.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.carbontax.org/where-carbon-is-taxed/british-columbia/">carbontax.org</a>, Canada is working towards a cap of $50 Canadian per tonne kg of CO2 by 2022. According to Google, this is equivalent to about $36.71 USD today.</p>

<p>When we do the math, this means that for every kg of lamb I eat, I’d need to pay around (20.44 / 1000) * 36.71 = $0.75 to offset it.</p>

<p>That was actually way cheaper than I was expecting and I’m not sure that’s large enough to de-incentivize me and it’s not that easy to remember, so I’ll hand-wavily set my carbon tax for beef and lamb as:</p>

<ul>
<li>beef - $1</li>
<li>lamb - $2 (cause it’s worse)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not gonna tax the other things because I’m not sure I really need to - they’re relatively less bad for the planet and are something I think I should keep eating for #health.</p>

<h2 id="transportation">transportation</h2>

<p>For travel, I want to limit the amount of flight, single / low occupancy vehicle, and long distance trips I have.</p>

<p><strong>flights</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://sustainabletravel.org/our-work/carbon-offsets/offset-footprint/">sustainable travel</a>
* Short flight (less than 3 hours) 1,100 pounds CO2 - $6.47
* medium flight (3-6 hours) - $8.91
* long flight (6+ hours) - $25.01</p>

<p><a href="https://www.atmosfair.de/en/offset/flight/">atmosfair</a>
* New York to Atlanta (762 miles) - $6.80</p>

<p>So it seems that a long flight will cost me about $25. That seems big enough to de-encentivize me, will pay off pretty much any flight, and is easy to remember. $25 it is.</p>

<p><strong>single / low-occupancy vehicle</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/car_offsetting.html">carbonfootprint.com</a> the cost to offset the carbon footprint of the average care each year is about $6.50. That’s way too low to actually change my behavior and it’d be hard to calculate each time how much I owed. So I’ll just set this to $1.</p>

<p><strong>shipping</strong></p>

<p>It looks like some companies may already be doing this (like <a href="https://www.etsy.com/impact">Etsy</a>) but I think it’s still a good thing to get in the habit of doing. According to <a href="https://carboncreditcapital.com/offsets/shipping-offset/">Carbon Credit Capital</a> the cost to carbon offset the shipping of a large package (6-20 lbs) is about $1 which seems reasonable to me as a tax rate.</p>



<p>When we put it all together, here are the taxes I end up with:</p>

<p>Food (charged per food item bought with it in it)</p>

<ul>
<li>beef - $1</li>
<li>lamb - $2</li>
</ul>

<p>transportation</p>

<ul>
<li>flight - $25</li>
<li>car ride - $1</li>
<li>shipping - $1</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn’t look like much now but I think this could add up pretty quick. I’ll report back when I have more data to share.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
