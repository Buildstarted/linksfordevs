The Pi 4 featured a faster CPU, options for up to 4GB of RAM, and a new, modern USB-C port for power delivery. The Pi 4 was the Raspberry Pi Foundation&apos;s first ever USB-C device, and, well, they screwed it up.</p>
<p>As detailed by <a href="https://www.scorpia.co.uk/2019/06/28/pi4-not-working-with-some-chargers-or-why-you-need-two-cc-resistors/">Tyler Ward</a>, the Raspberry Pi 4 has a non-compliant USB-C charging port and doesn&apos;t work with as many chargers as it should. Thanks to the open nature of Raspberry Pi (even <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/schematics/rpi_SCH_4b_4p0_reduced.pdf">the schematics</a> are online!), Ward was able to discover that Raspberry Pi just didn&apos;t design its USB-C port correctly. Two &quot;CC&quot; pins on a USB-C port are supposed to each get their own 5.1K ohms resistor, but Raspberry Pi came up with its own circuit design that allows them to share a single resistor. This is not a compliant design and breaks compatibility with some of the more powerful USB-C chargers out there.</p>
<p>Whether your USB-C charger works with the Pi 4 has to do with whether it uses an &quot;e-marked&quot; cable. E-marked cables are fully featured USB-C cables with chips inside that negotiate power management, accessory modes, data rates, and other communication specs. Since the Pi 4 USB-C port is wired incorrectly, these smart cables will detect the Pi 4 as an &quot;Audio Adaptor Accessory&quot; and refuse to charge them. Usually, e-marked cables are more expensive and come with larger, higher-powered items, like a USB-C laptop.</p>
<p>Benson Leung, an engineer at Google and one of the Internet&apos;s foremost <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/11/google-engineer-leaves-scathing-reviews-of-dodgy-usb-type-c-cables-on-amazon/">USB-C implementation experts</a>, has <a href="https://medium.com/@leung.benson/how-to-design-a-proper-usb-c-power-sink-hint-not-the-way-raspberry-pi-4-did-it-f470d7a5910">chimed in</a> on the Pi 4&apos;s USB-C design too, with a Medium post titled &quot;How to design a proper USB-C&#x2122; power sink (hint, not the way Raspberry Pi 4 did it).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of trying to come up with some clever circuit,&quot; Leung writes, &quot;hardware designers should simply <em class="lp">copy the figure from the USB-C Spec</em> <em>exactly</em> [emphasis his]<em class="lp">.</em> The Figure 4&#x2013;9 I posted above isn&#x2019;t simply a rough guideline of one way of making a USB-C receptacle. It&#x2019;s actually <strong class="gh gx"><em class="lp">normative</em></strong>, meaning mandatory, required by the spec in order to call your system a compliant USB-C power sink. Just copy it.&quot;</p>
<p>The Pi 4 is not the first high-profile device to get the USB-C spec wrong. The Nintendo Switch also has a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/nintendo-warns-against-using-substandard-switch-charging-cables/">non-compliant USB-C port</a> and has issues with certain USB-C cables as a result.</p>
<p>After reports started popping up on the Internet, Raspberry Pi cofounder Eben Upton admitted to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/your-new-raspberry-pi-4-wont-power-on-usb-c-cable-problem-now-officially-confirmed/">TechRepublic</a> that &quot;A smart charger with an e-marked cable will incorrectly identify the Raspberry Pi 4 as an audio adapter accessory and refuse to provide power.&quot; Upton went on to say, &quot;I expect this will be fixed in a future board revision, but for now users will need to apply one of the suggested workarounds. It&apos;s surprising this didn&apos;t show up in our (quite extensive) field testing program.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;suggested workarounds&quot; are to just use a non-e-marked cable, like the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/type-c-power-supply/">official Pi 4 charger</a>.</p>
<p>We reached out to Raspberry Pi about this issue and were told a board revision with a spec-compliant charging port should be out sometime in the &quot;next few months.&quot;</p> </div>
