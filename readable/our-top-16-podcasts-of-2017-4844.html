We hope you enjoy these podcasts as much as we all loved making them, and we are so grateful to <em>all</em> of you ‚Äî listeners, guests, interviewers, and especially our behind-the-scenes sound editors (Seven! Tommy! Nick!) ‚Äî who have been on this journey with us for a while.</p>

<h5>13. Long Time Scales</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://a16z.com/2017/07/17/pleistocenepark-geoengineering-rewilding-iceagebiome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Making a (Really) Wild Geo-Engineering Idea Real</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://a16z.com/2017/02/23/yuval-harari-from-homo-sapiens-to-homo-deus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brains, Bodies, Minds ‚Ä¶ and Techno-Religions</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The first episode, about gene-editing woolly mammoths and rewilding an Ice Age biome in Arctic Siberia, covers a bit of everything I love ‚Äî long time scales (as well as the art of timing itself); writing and editing (and especially the choices and tradeoffs involved); friendship (the guests); and most of all, the power of narrative for driving a big vision ‚Äî whether science, tech, or otherwise ‚Äî and motivating people to actually build it. The second episode, with <em>Sapiens</em>&nbsp;and <em>Homo Deus</em> author Yuval Harari, also focuses on very long time scales. But it‚Äôs really about how technology has allowed humans to manipulate evolution and go beyond our biological and environmental constraints ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs crossing oceans without gills and flying without wings or augmenting our bodies and brains with machines. So what does this mean for long-held systems of belief about education, religion, and more?</p>
<h5>14. The Economist(s)</h5>

</ul>
<p>These were some of the most fun and interesting episodes we recorded this year, all featuring economists. Who knew they ‚Äî and the topic ‚Äî could be so fun? From the complete-each-other‚Äôs-sentences energy <a href="https://a16z.com/2017/06/28/machine-platform-crowd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee</a>&nbsp;about whether networks replace the firm and the provocative yet respectful <a href="https://twitter.com/pt/status/907021913511170048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‚ÄúMarvel vs DC‚Äù-style</a>&nbsp;debate <a href="https://a16z.com/2017/09/08/trade-tech-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">between Noah Smith and Russ Roberts</a> about trade, jobs, and innovation ‚Äî to our very own Conversation With the brilliant <a href="https://a16z.com/2017/03/01/tyler-cowen-complacent-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyler Cowen</a> about complacency, performative signaling, and whether we‚Äôve ‚Äúoutsourced‚Äù our mobility ‚Äî these episodes really weave together key themes in technology and economics.</p>
<h5><em>‚Ä¶Hanne‚Äôs picks:</em></h5>
<h5>15. Putting AI in Medicine, in Practice</h5>

<p>So that giant whiteboard from Grey‚Äôs Anatomy? It‚Äôs still the reality for operating room scheduling ‚Äî and is one of the many areas ripe for AI-based intervention in medicine. This episode spans all the ways that machine and deep learning can (and will) have an immediate, practical impact in the medical field ‚Äî from the nitty gritty to grappling with big questions about major hurdles in place and the ways we need to think about actually implementing it when it comes to saving people‚Äôs lives.</p>
<h5>16. The Why Behind the Weird</h5>

<p>Is human belief perhaps the earliest technology? This lively conversation about economics and history looks at how superstitions and odd practices in human history ‚Äî such as judicial ordeals like boiling hands in water to determine guilt or innocence ‚Äî were actually extremely effective tools for achieving the desired outcome, when you look at the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô behind the ‚Äòweird‚Äô.</p>
