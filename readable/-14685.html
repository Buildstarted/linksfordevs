<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><section>Can this day get any worse? First, I wake up sick as a dog, coughing up phlegm and fighting to breathe through at least one nostril. I stumble into work an hour late and am immediately thrust into a whirlwind of stress: Tekken 3 screen-shots are here and we have to get them up NOW! And, to top it off, I have to review <a href="https://psx.ign.com/objects/000/000324.html">Spawn: The Eternal</a>, Sony's action/exploration game.<p>  Based more on Todd McFarlane's comic book than the movie, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/spawn-the-eternal">Spawn: The Eternal</a><div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spawn-Eternal-Playstation-1/dp/B00002SVWE?SubscriptionId=AKIAJV4KMHBMUG36SMIQ&amp;tag=ign_contextual-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B00002SVWE&amp;ascsubtag=84d2ef8b-b592-4a8f-928c-b4e3eb4b1e1a" target="_blank"></a><div><p><img src="https://psxmedia.ign.com/psx/image/object/000/000324/601580.jpg?width=96&amp;fit=bounds&amp;height=96&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05" alt=""></p></div></div> lets gamers take control of Al Simmins, former assassin and all around moral guy. After being killed by an associate, he pleads for another chance. Al's prayers are answered by Malebolgia, a particularly nasty denizen of hell. He's now got another chance but is required to lead Malebolgia's army of darkness against the forces of good. So the demon sends him through time to train, and eventually to return to hell to fight the big guy himself.</p><p>  Sound cool? Well, on paper it is. Todd McFarlane's Spawn comic is one of the best-selling and most popular comics of the 1990s and could have made a pretty good game. I use the word "could've" because it didn't. Spawn: The Eternal isn't a good game. It's the antithesis of a good game.</p><p>  To begin with, it's as ugly as the backside of a male dog with explosive diarrhea. The textures in the game are grainy and sloppy and look like something you might have seen on the 3DO four years ago. There are a few decent touches, like the sewer water, but overall looking at Spawn: The Eternal is like looking at a pile of broken glass. Which doesn't even cover the man himself. Poor Spawn looks like an ape in a costume, and that ain't pretty. He doesn't even have his magnificent cape until he gets into combat, which brings us to the next problem.</p><p>  The fine folks at Sony Interactive decided to give Spawn two engines: one for exploration, and one for combat. Control in the exploration mode is slow and awkward, but doesn't even compare to that of the combat mode. Once Spawn gets close to a bad guy, the camera switches to a side-on, fighting perspective. But for some reason the control scheme has also inexplicably switched, so now Spawn moves forward by pressing Right on the D-pad instead of Up. It's terribly confusing. In the end, though, most of the enemies can be beat by repeatedly pressing kick and sidestep at the same time. What's the point?</p><p>  While not as confusing, the exploratory portion of the game is hardly satisfying. Most of the puzzles consist of walking upstairs to open a door downstairs. Level design is uninspired when compared with something like Tomb Raider 2, or even Ghost in the Shell. There's just no real challenge here.</p><p>  If you're a complete Spawn nut, and just have to have everything Todd McFarlane does, you'll no doubt purchase the game just for the sake of it. But for everyone else who's just looking for a good action game, stay away from Spawn: The Eternal. It's a disappointing game that sullies the fine Spawn name.</p><p>  Adam Douglas </p></section></section></div></div></div>
