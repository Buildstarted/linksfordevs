Or, in this case, as we pursue the goal of never taking resources until the GC cycle hits, we need to <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1255908/Allocating-Memory-on-Linux-and-Windows">commit the bitmap to memory</a> first. This comes with a few interesting advantages, at least on Linux, where most of the bitmap would be mapped to zero page, especially for sparse heap.</p><p>Threads need to give up their TLABs and ask GC for new ones after GC finishes. </p><p>Some parts of runtime, especially those parts that deal with references to Java heap, get broken by GC, so we need to notify them that GC is about to act. This would let those subsystems to prepare/save parts of their state before impending GC moves.</p></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="_marking"><a class="anchor" href="#_marking"></a>3.2. Marking</h3><p>Stop-the-world marking is quite simple once we have all the pieces ready to go. Marking is pretty generic, and it would normally be the first step in many GC implementations.</p><div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++">{

In GC, "vertexes" are the objects, and "edges" are the references between them.</p><p>Technically, we could have just used recursion to walk the object graph, but it is a bad idea for arbitrary graphs, which can have very large diameters. Think about walking the linked list with 1 billion nodes in it. So, to limit the recursion depth, we use marking stack that records objects discovered.</p><p>The initial set of reachable objects comes from GC roots. Don’t dwell on what <code>process_roots</code> does for now, we will visit it later. So far, assume it walks all references reachable from the VM side.</p><p>The marking bitmap serves both as the thing that tracks the <em>marking wavefront</em> (the set of already visited objects), and in the end gives us the desired output: the set of all reachable objects. The actual work in done in the <code>EpsilonScanOopClosure</code>, that would be applied to all interesting objects, and which iterates all references in a given object, and here it is:</p><div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-c++" data-lang="c++">class EpsilonScanOopClosure : public BasicOopIterateClosure {
