For more information, see <a href="caching/response?view=aspnetcore-3.1" data-linktype="relative-path">Response caching in ASP.NET Core</a>.</p><h2 id="understand-hot-code-paths">Understand hot code paths</h2><p>In this document, a <em>hot code path</em> is defined as a code path that is frequently called and where much of the execution time occurs. Hot code paths typically limit app scale-out and performance and are discussed in several parts of this document.</p><h2 id="avoid-blocking-calls">Avoid blocking calls</h2><p>ASP.NET Core apps should be designed to process many requests simultaneously. Asynchronous APIs allow a small pool of threads to handle thousands of concurrent requests by not waiting on blocking calls. Rather than waiting on a long-running synchronous task to complete, the thread can work on another request.</p><p>A common performance problem in ASP.NET Core apps is blocking calls that could be asynchronous. Many synchronous blocking calls lead to <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vancem/2018/10/16/diagnosing-net-core-threadpool-starvation-with-perfview-why-my-service-is-not-saturating-all-cores-or-seems-to-stall/" data-linktype="external">Thread Pool starvation</a> and degraded response times.</p><p><strong>Do not</strong>:</p><ul><li>Block asynchronous execution by calling <a href="/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.wait" data-linktype="absolute-path">Task.Wait</a> or <a href="/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task-1.result" data-linktype="absolute-path">Task.Result</a>.</li><li>Acquire locks in common code paths. ASP.NET Core apps are most performant when architected to run code in parallel.</li><li>Call <a href="/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.run" data-linktype="absolute-path">Task.Run</a> and immediately await it. ASP.NET Core already runs app code on normal Thread Pool threads, so calling Task.Run only results in extra unnecessary Thread Pool scheduling. Even if the scheduled code would block a thread, Task.Run does not prevent that.</li></ul><p><strong>Do</strong>:</p><ul><li>Make <a href="#understand-hot-code-paths" data-linktype="self-bookmark">hot code paths</a> asynchronous.</li><li>Call data access, I/O, and long-running operations APIs asynchronously if an asynchronous API is available. Do <strong>not</strong> use <a href="/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.run" data-linktype="absolute-path">Task.Run</a> to make a synchronus API asynchronous.</li><li>Make controller/Razor Page actions asynchronous. The entire call stack is asynchronous in order to benefit from <a href="/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/" data-linktype="absolute-path">async/await</a> patterns.</li></ul><p>A profiler, such as <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview" data-linktype="external">PerfView</a>, can be used to find threads frequently added to the <a href="/en-us/windows/desktop/procthread/thread-pools" data-linktype="absolute-path">Thread Pool</a>. The <code>Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime/ThreadPoolWorkerThread/Start</code> event indicates a thread added to the thread pool. </p><h2 id="minimize-large-object-allocations">Minimize large object allocations</h2><p>The <a href="/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/" data-linktype="absolute-path">.NET Core garbage collector</a> manages allocation and release of memory automatically in ASP.NET Core apps. Automatic garbage collection generally means that developers don't need to worry about how or when memory is freed. However, cleaning up unreferenced objects takes CPU time, so developers should minimize allocating objects in <a href="#understand-hot-code-paths" data-linktype="self-bookmark">hot code paths</a>. Garbage collection is especially expensive on large objects (&gt; 85 K bytes). Large objects are stored on the <a href="/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/large-object-heap" data-linktype="absolute-path">large object heap</a> and require a full (generation 2) garbage collection to clean up. Unlike generation 0 and generation 1 collections, a generation 2 collection requires a temporary suspension of app execution. Frequent allocation and de-allocation of large objects can cause inconsistent performance.</p><p>Recommendations:</p><ul><li><strong>Do</strong> consider caching large objects that are frequently used. Caching large objects prevents expensive allocations.</li><li><strong>Do</strong> pool buffers by using an <a href="/en-us/dotnet/api/system.buffers.arraypool-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">ArrayPool&lt;T&gt;</a> to store large arrays.</li><li><strong>Do not</strong> allocate many, short-lived large objects on <a href="#understand-hot-code-paths" data-linktype="self-bookmark">hot code paths</a>.</li></ul><p>Memory issues, such as the preceding, can be diagnosed by reviewing garbage collection (GC) stats in <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview" data-linktype="external">PerfView</a> and examining:</p><ul><li>Garbage collection pause time.</li><li>What percentage of the processor time is spent in garbage collection.</li><li>How many garbage collections are generation 0, 1, and 2.</li></ul><p>For more information, see <a href="/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/performance" data-linktype="absolute-path">Garbage Collection and Performance</a>.</p><h2 id="optimize-data-access-and-io">Optimize data access and I/O</h2><p>Interactions with a data store and other remote services are often the slowest parts of an ASP.NET Core app. Reading and writing data efficiently is critical for good performance.</p><p>Recommendations:</p><ul><li><strong>Do</strong> call all data access APIs asynchronously.</li><li><strong>Do not</strong> retrieve more data than is necessary. Write queries to return just the data that's necessary for the current HTTP request.</li><li><strong>Do</strong> consider caching frequently accessed data retrieved from a database or remote service if slightly out-of-date data is acceptable. Depending on the scenario, use a <a href="caching/memory?view=aspnetcore-3.1" data-linktype="relative-path">MemoryCache</a> or a <a href="caching/distributed?view=aspnetcore-3.1" data-linktype="relative-path">DistributedCache</a>. For more information, see <a href="caching/response?view=aspnetcore-3.1" data-linktype="relative-path">Response caching in ASP.NET Core</a>.</li><li><strong>Do</strong> minimize network round trips. The goal is to retrieve the required data in a single call rather than several calls.</li><li><strong>Do</strong> use <a href="/en-us/ef/core/querying/tracking#no-tracking-queries" data-linktype="absolute-path">no-tracking queries</a> in Entity Framework Core when accessing data for read-only purposes. EF Core can return the results of no-tracking queries more efficiently.</li><li><strong>Do</strong> filter and aggregate LINQ queries (with <code>.Where</code>, <code>.Select</code>, or <code>.Sum</code> statements, for example) so that the filtering is performed by the database.</li><li><strong>Do</strong> consider that EF Core resolves some query operators on the client, which may lead to inefficient query execution. For more information, see <a href="/en-us/ef/core/querying/client-eval#client-evaluation-performance-issues" data-linktype="absolute-path">Client evaluation performance issues</a>.</li><li><strong>Do not</strong> use projection queries on collections, which can result in executing "N + 1" SQL queries. For more information, see <a href="/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-2.1#optimization-of-correlated-subqueries" data-linktype="absolute-path">Optimization of correlated subqueries</a>.</li></ul><p>See <a href="/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-2.0#explicitly-compiled-queries" data-linktype="absolute-path">EF High Performance</a> for approaches that may improve performance in high-scale apps:</p><p>We recommend measuring the impact of the preceding high-performance approaches before committing the code base. The additional complexity of compiled queries may not justify the performance improvement.</p><p>Query issues can be detected by reviewing the time spent accessing data with <a href="/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-overview" data-linktype="absolute-path">Application Insights</a> or with profiling tools. Most databases also make statistics available concerning frequently executed queries.</p><h2 id="pool-http-connections-with-httpclientfactory">Pool HTTP connections with HttpClientFactory</h2><p>Although <a href="/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient" data-linktype="absolute-path">HttpClient</a> implements the <code>IDisposable</code> interface, it's designed for reuse. Closed <code>HttpClient</code> instances leave sockets open in the <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state for a short period of time. If a code path that creates and disposes of <code>HttpClient</code> objects is frequently used, the app may exhaust available sockets. <a href="/en-us/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/implement-resilient-applications/use-httpclientfactory-to-implement-resilient-http-requests" data-linktype="absolute-path">HttpClientFactory</a> was introduced in ASP.NET Core 2.1 as a solution to this problem. It handles pooling HTTP connections to optimize performance and reliability.</p><p>Recommendations:</p><h2 id="keep-common-code-paths-fast">Keep common code paths fast</h2><p>You want all of your code to be fast, frequently called code paths are the most critical to optimize:</p><ul><li>Middleware components in the app's request processing pipeline, especially middleware run early in the pipeline. These components have a large impact on performance.</li><li>Code that's executed for every request or multiple times per request. For example, custom logging, authorization handlers, or initialization of transient services.</li></ul><p>Recommendations:</p><p>Most requests to an ASP.NET Core app can be handled by a controller or page model calling necessary services and returning an HTTP response. For some requests that involve long-running tasks, it's better to make the entire request-response process asynchronous.</p><p>Recommendations:</p><ul><li><strong>Do not</strong> wait for long-running tasks to complete as part of ordinary HTTP request processing.</li><li><strong>Do</strong> consider handling long-running requests with <a href="../fundamentals/host/hosted-services?view=aspnetcore-3.1" data-linktype="relative-path">background services</a> or out of process with an <a href="/en-us/azure/azure-functions/" data-linktype="absolute-path">Azure Function</a>. Completing work out-of-process is especially beneficial for CPU-intensive tasks.</li><li><strong>Do</strong> use real-time communication options, such as <a href="../signalr/introduction?view=aspnetcore-3.1" data-linktype="relative-path">SignalR</a>, to communicate with clients asynchronously.</li></ul><h2 id="minify-client-assets">Minify client assets</h2><p>ASP.NET Core apps with complex front-ends frequently serve many JavaScript, CSS, or image files. Performance of initial load requests can be improved by:</p><ul><li>Bundling, which combines multiple files into one.</li><li>Minifying, which reduces the size of files by removing whitespace and comments.</li></ul><p>Recommendations:</p><ul><li><strong>Do</strong> use ASP.NET Core's <a href="../client-side/bundling-and-minification?view=aspnetcore-3.1" data-linktype="relative-path">built-in support</a> for bundling and minifying client assets.</li><li><strong>Do</strong> consider other third-party tools, such as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" data-linktype="external">Webpack</a>, for complex client asset management.</li></ul><h2 id="compress-responses">Compress responses</h2><p>Reducing the size of the response usually increases the responsiveness of an app, often dramatically. One way to reduce payload sizes is to compress an app's responses. For more information, see <a href="response-compression?view=aspnetcore-3.1" data-linktype="relative-path">Response compression</a>.</p><h2 id="use-the-latest-aspnet-core-release">Use the latest ASP.NET Core release</h2><p>Each new release of ASP.NET Core includes performance improvements. Optimizations in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core mean that newer versions generally outperform older versions. For example, .NET Core 2.1 added support for compiled regular expressions and benefitted from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/mt814808.aspx" data-linktype="external">Span&lt;T&gt;</a>. ASP.NET Core 2.2 added support for HTTP/2. <a href="../release-notes/aspnetcore-3.0?view=aspnetcore-3.1" data-linktype="relative-path">ASP.NET Core 3.0 adds many improvements</a> that reduce memory usage and improve throughput. If performance is a priority, consider upgrading to the current version of ASP.NET Core.</p><h2 id="minimize-exceptions">Minimize exceptions</h2><p>Exceptions should be rare. Throwing and catching exceptions is slow relative to other code flow patterns. Because of this, exceptions shouldn't be used to control normal program flow.</p><p>Recommendations:</p><ul><li><strong>Do not</strong> use throwing or catching exceptions as a means of normal program flow, especially in <a href="#understand-hot-code-paths" data-linktype="self-bookmark">hot code paths</a>.</li><li><strong>Do</strong> include logic in the app to detect and handle conditions that would cause an exception.</li><li><strong>Do</strong> throw or catch exceptions for unusual or unexpected conditions.</li></ul><p>App diagnostic tools, such as Application Insights, can help to identify common exceptions in an app that may affect performance.</p><h2 id="performance-and-reliability">Performance and reliability</h2><p>The following sections provide performance tips and known reliability problems and solutions.</p><h2 id="avoid-synchronous-read-or-write-on-httprequesthttpresponse-body">Avoid synchronous read or write on HttpRequest/HttpResponse body</h2><p>All IO in ASP.NET Core is asynchronous. Servers implement the <code>Stream</code> interface, which has both synchronous and asynchronous overloads. The asynchronous ones should be preferred to avoid blocking thread pool threads. Blocking threads can lead to thread pool starvation.</p><p><strong>Do not do this:</strong> The following example uses the <a href="/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.streamreader.readtoend" data-linktype="absolute-path">ReadToEnd</a>.

Large objects are expensive in two ways:</p><ul><li>The allocation cost is high because the memory for a newly allocated large object has to be cleared. The CLR guarantees that memory for all newly allocated objects is cleared.</li><li>LOH is collected with the rest of the heap. LOH requires a full <a href="/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals" data-linktype="absolute-path">garbage collection</a> or <a href="/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals#generations" data-linktype="absolute-path">Gen2 collection</a>.</li></ul><p>This <a href="https://adamsitnik.com/Array-Pool/#the-problem" data-linktype="external">blog post</a> describes the problem succinctly:</p><blockquote><p>When a large object is allocated, it’s marked as Gen 2 object. Not Gen 0 as for small objects. The consequences are that if you run out of memory in LOH, GC cleans up the whole managed heap, not only LOH. So it cleans up Gen 0, Gen 1 and Gen 2 including LOH. This is called full garbage collection and is the most time-consuming garbage collection. For many applications, it can be acceptable. But definitely not for high-performance web servers, where few big memory buffers are needed to handle an average web request (read from a socket, decompress, decode JSON &amp; more).</p></blockquote><p>Naively storing a large request or response body into a single <code>byte[]</code> or <code>string</code>:</p><ul><li>May result in quickly running out of space in the LOH.</li><li>May cause performance issues for the app because of full GCs running.</li></ul><h2 id="working-with-a-synchronous-data-processing-api">Working with a synchronous data processing API</h2><p>When using a serializer/de-serializer that only supports synchronous reads and writes (for example,  <a href="https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/Introduction.htm" data-linktype="external">JSON.NET</a>):</p><ul><li>Buffer the data into memory asynchronously before passing it into the serializer/de-serializer.</li></ul><p>ASP.NET Core 3.0 uses <a href="/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Text.Json</a> by default for JSON serialization. <a href="/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Text.Json</a>:</p><ul><li>Reads and writes JSON asynchronously.</li><li>Is optimized for UTF-8 text.</li><li>Typically higher performance than <code>Newtonsoft.Json</code>.</li></ul><h2 id="do-not-store-ihttpcontextaccessorhttpcontext-in-a-field">Do not store IHttpContextAccessor.HttpContext in a field</h2><p>The <a href="/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.ihttpcontextaccessor.httpcontext#Microsoft_AspNetCore_Http_IHttpContextAccessor_HttpContext" data-linktype="absolute-path">IHttpContextAccessor.HttpContext</a> returns the <code>HttpContext</code> of the active request when accessed from the request thread.
