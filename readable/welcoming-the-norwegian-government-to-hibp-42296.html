            <p>Over the last couple of years, I've been increasingly <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-uk-and-australian-governments-are-now-monitoring-their-gov-domains-on-have-i-been-pwned/">providing governments with better access to their departments' data exposed in breaches</a> by giving them free and unfettered API access to their domains. As I've been travelling around the world this year, I've been carving out time to spend with governments to better understand the infosec challenges they're facing and the role HIBP can play in helping them tackle those challenges. During my time in Norway, that included spending time with their National Cyber Security Centre in Oslo. Today, I'm very happy to welcome Norway as the 6th national government onto Have I Been Pwned!</p><p>You'll see more national governments come on board in the near future but for now, it's a big welcome to <a href="https://www.nsm.stat.no/">Norway's National Cyber Security Centre</a>!</p>
