<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Yesterday, the FFT <a href="https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2020/03/breaking-roland-garros-says-it-will-play-tournament-september/88029/">revealed it was pushing Roland Garros back</a> to a September 20 start, with the tennis world reacting mostly in surprise at the move.</p>

<p>Today, another major solution broke in response to uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. In an email sent to players that stated the entire spring clay-court season (at all levels) was cancelled—through June 7—the tours' decision about rankings was also disclosed.</p>

<p>“In parallel, the ATP Rankings and WTA Rankings will be frozen throughout this period and until further notice.”</p>

<p>The tours soon made the news public in a joint statement, that added.</p>

<p>"We are assessing all options related to preserving and maximizing the tennis calendar based on various return dates for the Tours, which remains an unknown at this time. We are committed to working through these matters with our player and tournament members, and the other governing bodies, in the weeks and months ahead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Ashleigh Barty, Bianca Andreescu, Karolina Pliskova and Dominic Thiem all had considerable points to defend as a result of title successes during this cycle a year ago. The rankings freeze currently runs through June 7.</p>

<p>"Now is not a time to act unilaterally, but in unison," the tours' statement concluded.&nbsp;"All decisions related to the impact of the coronavirus require appropriate consultation and review with the stakeholders in the game, a view that is shared by ATP, WTA, ITF, AELTC, Tennis Australia, and USTA."</p>
