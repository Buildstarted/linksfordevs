And if the time is right, what are you actually supposed to do?</p><p>If you're interested to hear about a pragmatic approach to performance, this talk will explain when is the right time to think about benchmarking, but more importantly will run through how to correctly benchmark .NET code so any decisions made will be based on information about your code that is trustworthy.</p><p>Additionally you'll also find out about some of the common, and some of the unknown, performance pitfalls of the .NET Framework and we'll discuss the true meaning behind the phrase "premature optimization is the root of all evil".</p><p>About David</p><p>David is a developer at Microsoft, working on Visual Studio and specifically the Managed Project System that powers the new “SDK-style” projects for C#, VB and F#. With almost 20 years experience as a developer, architect and manager, he has surprisingly little experience writing biographies of himself in the third person. When working, David is particularly interesting in C# and exactly what happens under the covers of the code. When not working, he’s usually found trying to tear his two sons away from their Lego, whilst yelling at them to leave his alone.</p><p>Agenda</p><p>* Note later starting time</p><p>6pm - Welcome, What's New, Job Tips<br>6.30pm - Pragmatic Performance<br>7.30pm - Pizza, Refreshments &amp; Networking<br>8.00pm - Close</p><p>Free, thanks to Encode Talent Management</p></div></div></div></div>
