                        <p>WASHINGTON — Metro is making good on warnings that it would close stations. The transit agency officially closed Smithsonian Metro and Arlington Cemetery Metro at 5 p.m. on March 19 so tourists would be thwarted from using the system to see the cherry blossoms blooming near the Tidal Basin.</p><p>On Tuesday, WMATA announced the closure of 17 more stations, citing decreased ridership. Metro’s Pandemic Task Force said ridership was down by 90%, and that closures were necessary to conserve cleaning supplies.&nbsp;</p>      <div id="article_mid1_0" data-model-refresh="none" data-model-refresh-limit="none" data-model-settings="{&quot;ad&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;article_mid1&quot;,&quot;div&quot;:&quot;article_mid1_0&quot;,&quot;sizes&quot;:[[300,250],[1,1],[750,570],[1,2]]},&quot;targeting&quot;:{&quot;pgid&quot;:[&quot;a1c0b200-c10d-421a-823c-d1155faad909&quot;],&quot;pgtype&quot;:[&quot;article&quot;],&quot;strnativekey&quot;:[&quot;2YNEkKMk1QC5WsCndTXLDYVB&quot;],&quot;video_included&quot;:[&quot;true&quot;],&quot;ttid&quot;:[&quot;6ac1f522-6365-4093-989f-56269c7d23b6&quot;]}}" data-google-query-id="CNCJ5f7_tegCFVVGXgodX7UCRQ"><div id="vi-stories-top-div"><div id="vi-stories-main-container"><div id="vi-stories-description-container"><p>Canada Mulls Closing Borders</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Everyday commuters told WUSA9 that the closures are an unnecessary inconvenience. Some are still working in offices near Smithsonian Metro and were surprised when they showed up to a shuttered station.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/metro-officials-stay-home-essential-travel-only-new-hours-on-trains-buses-due-to-coronavirus/65-d12f7c2a-b203-44fd-9033-7d01c291eed8">Metro officials: 'Stay home. Essential travel only' | New hours on trains, buses due to coronavirus</a></strong></p><p>The coronavirus crisis closed one other station on March 19, but only briefly. D.C. Fire and EMS told WUSA9 that Metro Center was closed when a WMATA worker claimed they were exposed to COVID-19. Emergency workers were called to the station at 10:38 a.m., but a department spokesman told WUSA9 that the patient signed a refusal of treatment about an hour later. A Metro spokesperson said the station was disinfected before it reopened.</p><p><strong><a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="https://www.wusa9.com/appredirect/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download the brand new WUSA9 app here</a>.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><a data-auth="NotApplicable" href="https://www.wusa9.com/email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em><strong>Sign up for the Get Up DC newsletter</strong></em><em>: Your forecast.
