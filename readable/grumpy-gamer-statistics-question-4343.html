<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><a href="https://grumpygamer.com/statistics_question"></a><h3>Statistics Question</h3><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/images.grumpygamer.com/chartish.png"></p><p>I took a statistics class in college, but I didn't pay much attention due to never seeing a need for the knowledge. Much of my education is like this: "Why the hell would I ever need this", only to find out years later that I desperately needed it (yeah, I'm talking to you, high school algebra).<br></p><p>Thimbleweed Park is out on seven different digital stores and each of them has a completely different way of reporting sales.  It's time-consuming and frustrating to download each sales report once a month and hand massage the data into a useable format.<br></p><p>I spent the last few days writing a python script to take all the data and move it into a single SQL database so I could quickly query tons of useful information.<br></p><p>SELECT countries.country, SUM(sales.units_sold) AS units_sold<br>FROM sales JOIN countries<br>ON sales.country_code = countries.country_code<br>WHERE units_sold &gt; 0<br>GROUP BY sales.country_code<br>ORDER BY units_sold DESC<br></p><p>One thing I want to know is an "average" units/day for each store, so I can keep an eye on long-term trends.  Sounds easy, except for sales and promotions happening all-to-often, and they produce huge spikes in the data that I don't care about. I just want to see an average for average non-sale days and I don't want to go in and remove the sale ranges as sometimes they happen without my knowledge.<br></p><p>I'm looking for a way to take an average that removes spikes that are well above the average. This doesn't have to be in SQL, that computation will most likely happen in a spreadsheet, or could happen in the report generation if it's too complex.<br></p><p>Maybe this isn't possible, but I figured I'd ask.<br></p></div></div></div>
