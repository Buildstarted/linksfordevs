Predominately we look at the Microsoft development stack, but we do have platform neutral and methodology based talks too.</p><p>We guarantee one meeting a month, normally on the 3rd Thursday of the month. Everyone is welcome! Be you a student or grizzled professional, come along for a night of great content, people and pizza :)</p><p>We offer your first 2 events for free, then after that we'd like you to take out a membership to continue attending. Speak to either John or Rich to find out more about how the membership works :)</p><p>If you're wondering why you can't see the full 5 years of back sessions we've had, it's because we've recently migrated from our old home at NxtGenUG Southampton (<a href="http://www.nxtgenug.net/Southampton" title="http://www.nxtgenug.net/Southampton" target="">http://www.nxtgenug.net/Southampton</a>). By all means go and see what we've covered in the previous 5 years :D</p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div id="eventCard-263536847"><p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/DeveloperSouthCoast/events/263536847/"><span>Building next generation web apps with Blazor</span></a></p><div><div><div><div><div><p>The widespread adoption of WebAssembly, by all major browsers, has opened the world of front-end development to languages other than JavaScript. The platform leading the charge is Blazor - a new client-side UI framework from the Microsoft (http://asp.net) team. Blazor allows developers to write client-side applications using C# which runs inside the browser without needing plugins or transpilation - how cool is that!

In this code-focused session, we'll explore the Blazor platform. We'll start by looking at fundamentals such as how to structure Blazor applications for flexibility. The component model, looking at life cycle methods and inter-component communication, as well as forms and validation. We'll then explore some more advanced topics such as authentication, authorisation and JavaScript interop.

These bring up different challenges such as integration with different systems, long-lived transactions, failure recovery and more.
In this session we’ll learn how to address these issues with a distributed, event-driven architecture based on microservices that I’ve been using successfully in the last three years across different projects. We also learn how to implement this architecture with MassTransit and Automatonymous and run it on containers with Kubernetes.

The session broken down into three parts. In the first part of the session we’ll brush up some DDD patterns and microservices patterns such as sagas, orchestration and different communication patterns.
On the second part we’ll put those patterns in practice by building up the sample architecture for an imaginary business, which requires integration with external systems with different communication protocols and built with different technologies (Python, Node, …).
On the final part we’ll see how to implement the architecture.

Ben Arroyo is a .NET developer and chicken keeper. Has been playing with Microsoft technologies for over 20 years.
Full stack developer, although a bit lopsided onto the frontend.
Worked as independent contractor for the last 9 years.
Currently working as team leader at Supplier Assessment Services.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div id="eventCard-267727237"><p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/DeveloperSouthCoast/events/267727237/"><span>From four to forty in four years - trials and tribulations of growing a team</span></a></p><div><div><div><div><div><p>Rich worked together with the team at PureGym between 2016 to 2020.

During that time Rich was directly involved in helping the team navigate the process of scaling up to 16 people, scaling back down to 8 people until eventually growing to its current size of 40 people.

This talk is a journey through that time period and will touch on the various approaches taken including topics such as "Agile", Scrum, Lean, Kanban, GIST planning, Lean Startup, DevOps, IaC, Azure, Story Mapping, BDD, TDD, Project vs Product and we'll be looking at the successes, failures and lessons learned.

We'll also look at how the team dynamic shifted and what structures and interaction models were chosen. We will discuss what, in Rich's opinion, has worked well and what hasn't worked well during that time.

No doubt you will walk away from this session with a long list of books to read and hopefully some insights into whether you might want to try some of the approaches discussed during the talk.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div id="eventCard-264448307"><p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/DeveloperSouthCoast/events/264448307/"><span>'Globally resilient websites with Front Door' with Callum Whyte.</span></a></p><div><div><div><div><div><p>Delivering maximum uptime and the fastest response to our end users all over the world is very important... So we deploy our application to multiple regions and route traffic to the nearest available servers. But managing and visualising each component of our infrastructure, how it everything hangs together, detecting and handling failure, as well as deployments, can all be a challenge.

This session will dive in to the tools we can use, like Cloudflare and Azure Front Door, to add world-class resilience to a globally distributed Umbraco website - for maximum uptime and speed. We'll look how to tackle other interesting challenges, like cache busting and routing our users to the best / fastest server for them.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="photos"></section><section id="discussions"></section></div></div></div>
