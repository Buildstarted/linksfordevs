<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-click-id="text"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>So, as a kid I was to poor to ever afford a gaming console, back then if I remember Atari was the shit, and used to play at friends houses, Space Invaders was my favorite.  I used to go gaming arcades all the time, would even sell candy at school so I could afford to play. Galaga and Cenepede were my go to games, along with this really realistic for the time driving game (can't remember, early dementia maybe).  Over the years I always thought about getting a console, but was to busy with all sorts of other hobbies and they are pretty pricey.  Another reason I have avoided getting a console, I have quite the addictive personality, I'm a recovery 20 years from drugs and alcohol. When I get obsessed with something I get Coco for Cocoa puffs about it. Knowing me I figured I'd start playing one of these and never put it down, stop going to work, lose my job, girlfriend and dog. Well fucking nasty ass Covid-19 comes along and I'm bored as fuck, only so much Netflix and YouTube vids to watch, and staring at my phone scrolling Reddit is hurting my eyes.  Researched consoles and choose an Xbox, Best Buy had the One X on sale with Jedi Fallen order bundle. Do I want to be a Jedi? Oh hell yeah!  So, ordered and all I can say is HOLY MOTHER OF GOD games have come a long way!  This this is amazing. Graphics are absolutely beautiful. sound is killer. Story is super cool, you feel like your playing ca game and watching a movie at same time. And the adrenaline I get, my hands get so sweaty and I have to take breaks every 15-20 minutes of play, it's overwhelming sometimes. You kids that have been playing these games since your little, I kind of feel bad because you probably don't realize how absolutely fucking amazing these things are.  Yes, it's hard as hell to figure out the buttons sometimes and I start screaming so loud out of frustration my dogs leave the room.  Yes, I didn't need to spend 300 on a game right now.  Yes, I'm not getting other shit done like painting the house or showering. But it's awesome and I totally feel like a little kid again.  Gotta figure out next game I wanna get, maybe Mario Cart or some other driving game, I always dug driving games as a kid.  Anyway, just wanted to share.</p><p>Edit: wow this blew up, first gold, silver, and other stuff, sweet!  Thank you so much! To many comments to reply to but I've been reading them all.  And someone who wants to remain anonymous gifted me with 3 months of Ultimate, super nice!</p><p>Edit 2: wow, this is nuts!  So many awesome comments, enjoy reading them all!  gotten even more offers for subscriptions, someone from EA Sports gifted me a year subscription!<br>Oh, and my noob self didn't know Mario Kart (not Cart) isn't on Xbox, oh well lol.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
