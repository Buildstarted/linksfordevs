<p>Apple makes the argument that developers should have to pay for the running of the App Store, but it’s not the largest developers using by  far the most App Store resources who are paying.</p>



<p>Apps by Facebook surely account for some huge percentage of all downloads on the entire App Store. Facebook pays just $99 per year for this service.</p>



<p>Google – $99 per year. Amazon – $99 per year + a special deal for video that no one else gets.  Netflix – $99 per year.</p>



<p>Funny how small developers have to pay 30/15%, and have no way to work around it, but there’s exceptions everywhere for other monopolies and mega-corporations.</p>



<p>“The only apps that are subject to a commission are those where the developer acquires a customer on an Apple device and where the features or services would be experienced and consumed on an Apple device” says Tim Cook. </p>



<p>Tim, how is it possible given todays rules for a small developer to write an app where the developer could prove that they did not “acquire the customer on an Apple device” but instead acquired them via advertising the developer had to pay for (e.g. ads on Google, or via their own website) and therefor should not pay 30%? I’d like to see the steps on how to do that.</p>



<p><em>Note to non-technical audience members: Apple is not providing some kind of amazing technical service here. If you build and distribute an app via the App Store that sells a t-shirt instead of a digital photo you don’t have to use Apple payments and you don’t pay 30%. They have just drawn a line in the sand where they want it to be.</em></p>
