      <p>Anyone running a federating instance of the <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> homeserver
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> will likely have seen this: synapse is database-hungry. It
tends to take a lot of space. In this post, I'm documenting how I shrunk my homeserver database from 100GB
to a little under 8GB, during a long maintenance cleanup.</p>
<p>There are mostly three reasons the synapse database tends to get large over time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stuff that no longer needs to be kept around and should be deleted</li>
<li>Synapse is extremely cache-happy, and this takes a lot of space</li>
<li>Table bloat &amp; Index bloat in PostgreSQL</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets tackle all 3 of them, one after the other</p>
<h2>Stuff that no longer needs to be kept around</h2>
<h4>Forgotten rooms</h4>
<p>The first and immediate thing that can be deleted are rooms which no longer contain any of your local users.
These rooms take space in your database, and no longer serve any purpose. At some point synapse may
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4720">learn to garbage-collect them</a>, but for now we need to do
this by hand using the admin synapse APIs.</p>
<p>First of all we need to identify these rooms. We can retrieve the roomlist using the
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/admin_api/rooms.md">rooms API</a>, like so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl --header <span>"Authorization: Bearer &lt;your access token&gt;"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>'https://matrix.my.home/_synapse/admin/v1/rooms?limit=300'</span> &gt; roomlist.json
</pre></div>


<p>You'll need to replace <code>&lt;your access token&gt;</code> by an access token of
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/admin_api/README.rst">an admin account</a>, and you can
set <code>limit=XXX</code> to some value higher than your number of rooms, to ensure you get the whole list. If you are
unsure of the total amount of rooms your HS has, the returned JSON contains a <code>"total_rooms"</code> key with that
count.</p>
<p>Then, we can extract from that list the rooms with no local users:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jq <span>'.rooms[] | select(.joined_local_members == 0) | .room_id'</span> &lt; roomlist.json &gt; to_purge.txt
</pre></div>


<p>And then, we can purge these rooms one after the other using the
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/admin_api/purge_room.md">purge API</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl --header <span>"Authorization: Bearer &lt;your access token&gt;"</span> <span>\</span>
    -X POST -H <span>"Content-Type: application/json"</span> -d <span>"{ \"room_id\": \"</span><span>$room_id</span><span>\" }"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>'https://matrix.my.home/_synapse/admin/v1/purge_room'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that these last requests won't return until synapse effectively has purged the room, which may take a
while. As such, if your synapse is behind a reverse proxy, you might want to run these directly from the
server hosting it on the local socket, to avoid your reverse-proxy from time-out-ing synapse. You'll want to
wait for one purge to have finished before starting the next, so as to not overload your synapse and database.</p>
<h4>Old history of large rooms</h4>
<p>Very large rooms such as <code>#matrix:matrix.org</code> tend to accumulate quite a lot of history, and you may want to
get rid of it. You can do so using the
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/admin_api/purge_history_api.rst">purge history api</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl --header <span>"Authorization: Bearer &lt;your access token&gt;"</span> <span>\</span>
    -X POST -H <span>"Content-Type: application/json"</span> <span>\</span>
    -d <span>'{ "delete_local_events": false, "purge_up_to_ts": 1577836800000 }'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>"https://matrix.my.home/_synapse/admin/v1/purge_history/</span><span>$room_id</span><span>"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here, you can decide to also delete historical events from the users of your HS (for which you are the
original source, meaning no-one will be able to retrieve them from you any more), and you can specify some
timestamp <em>in milliseconds</em> up to which the history should be purged.</p>
<h2>Optimizing synapse cache</h2>
<p>Now that all the stuff to be removed has been removed, we can start tidying up the rest, and compressing
Synapse cache. This step will need to be done on the server, as we'll directly access the PostgreSQL database.</p>
<p>The main table responsible for database bloat is <code>state_groups_state</code>, which is inefficiently managed. But
luckily, the matrix team have developed a tool that can be used to selectively compress the state of a room:
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/rust-synapse-compress-state">synapse-compress-state</a>. You'll need to clone it
and compile it (it's a rust program, just <code>cargo build --release</code> it and copy the resulting binary on your
server).</p>
<p>Now, this tool needs to be run individually on rooms, so lets first identify which rooms are in need of such a
compression. They are generally very large rooms and rooms bridged to IRC, which encounter a lot of state
changes due to the numerous leaves and joins.</p>
<p>This SQL request will give you a list of your rooms and their number of group states:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>room_id</span><span>,</span> <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>count</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>state_groups_state</span>
    <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>room_id</span>
    <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>count</span> <span>DESC</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Overall, I considered rooms with a count larger than 100.000 to be in need of being cleaned up.</p>
<p>To analyze a room for compression, run the previously linked tool like so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>synapse-compress-state -t -o state-compressor.sql <span>\</span>
    -p <span>"host=localhost user=&lt;synapse db user&gt; password=&lt;synapse db password&gt; dbname=&lt;synapse db&gt;"</span> <span>\</span>
    -r <span>"</span><span>$room_id</span><span>"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This command will not modify your database, but instead generate a file <code>state-compressor.sql</code> containing the
changes that it would apply. It'll also give you a summary of how much it has compressed the state of the
room (for some of my rooms it went down to 0.4% of the original size). If you are happy with the compression,
you can then apply the changes:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>psql -U <span>'&lt;synapse db user&gt;'</span> <span>'&lt;synapse db name&gt;'</span> &lt; state-compressor.sql
</pre></div>


<p>And repeat to compress all of your rooms that need it. You can do all of this while your synapse instance is
running.</p>
<h2>3. Table bloat &amp; Index bloat in PostgreSQL</h2>
<p><em>NOTE: This last step will require that you stop your Synapse instance to be done.</em></p>
<p>After all those steps, your database size as reported by PostgreSQL using <code>\d+</code> may not have changed much.
This is because PostgreSQL does not automatically free all this space, but instead keeps it around to reuse it
when needed. This is generally a good idea, but we are here to reclaim this space because it took too much!</p>
<h4>Index bloat</h4>
<p>The first part to handle is the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-reindex.html">index bloat</a>.
Basically, the B-Tree structure that PostgreSQL uses for its indexes can become very space inefficient if a
lot of entries are removed in a table. To solve this the remedy is simple: rebuild all the indexes.</p>
<p>To do so, run this in PostgreSQL as the <code>postgres</code> superuser:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>REINDEX</span> <span>(</span><span>VERBOSE</span><span>)</span> <span>DATABASE</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>synapse</span> <span>db</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This will lock a large part of the database while it runs, hence why Synapse needs to be shut down in the
meantime.</p>
<p>On my database, this <code>REINDEX</code> freed about 40GB of space.</p>
<h4>Table bloat</h4>
<p>Similarly, we can tell PostgreSQL to return to the operating system all the space it is no longer using, using
the <code>VACUUM</code> command, again to be run as <code>postgres</code> superuser in the Synapse database:</p>



<p>PostgreSQL have several kinds of vacuum routines. The <code>VACUUM FULL</code> will lock the database and copy each table
into new storage, freeing the previous one. This frees up space and compacts back the tables, solving
fragmentation issues.</p>
<p>And voilà, with all this, your Synapse database should have significantly shrunk in size. If not, that means
it was in a way better shape than mine. ;)</p>
