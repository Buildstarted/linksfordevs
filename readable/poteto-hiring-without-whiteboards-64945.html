<p>A list of companies (or teams) that don't do "whiteboard" interviews. "Whiteboards" is used as a metaphor, and is a <em>symbol</em> for the kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview practices. Whiteboards are not bad ‚Äì CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode <em>probably</em> fall into a similar category.</p>
<p>The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work. For example, pairing on a real world problem or a paid/unpaid take home exercise. Read (and contribute to) <a href="https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/blob/master/RECOMMENDATIONS.md">our recommendations</a> for ways to conduct better interviews.</p>
<h3>tl;dr</h3>
