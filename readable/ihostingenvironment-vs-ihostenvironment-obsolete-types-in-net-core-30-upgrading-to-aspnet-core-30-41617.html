<p>In this post I describe the differences between various ASP.NET Core types that have been marked as obsolete in .NET Core 3.0. I describe why things have changed, where the replacement types are, and when you should use them.</p>
<h2 id="asp-net-core-merges-with-the-generic-host">ASP.NET Core merges with the generic host<a href="#asp-net-core-merges-with-the-generic-host"></a></h2>
<p>ASP.NET Core 2.1 introduced the GenericHost as a way of building non-HTTP apps using the <em>Microsoft.Extensions.*</em> primitives for configuration, dependency injection, and logging. While this was a really nice idea, the hosting abstractions introduced were fundamentally incompatible with the HTTP hosting infrastructure used by ASP.NET Core. This led to various <a href="https://andrewlock.net/the-asp-net-core-generic-host-namespace-clashes-and-extension-methods/">namespace clashes and incompatibilities</a> that mostly caused me to avoid using the generic host.</p>
<p>In ASP.NET Core 3.0 a big effort went into converting the web hosting infrastructure to be compatible with the generic host. Instead of having duplicate abstractions - one for ASP.NET Core and one for the generic host - the ASP.NET Core web hosting infrastructure could run <em>on top of</em> the generic host <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/1599a5a2a791def8a23784756c303a914c0e1631/src/Hosting/Hosting/src/GenericHost/GenericWebHostedService.cs">as an <code>IHostedService</code></a>. </p>
<p>This isn't the whole story though. ASP.NET Core 3 doesn't force you to convert to the new generic-host-based infrastructure immediately when upgrading from 2.x to 3.0. You can continue to use the <code>WebHostBuilder</code> instead of <code>HostBuilder</code> if you wish. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30">migration documentation</a> implies it's required, but in reality it's optional at this stage if you need or want to keep using it for some reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd suggest converting to <code>HostBuilder</code> as part of your upgrade if possible. I suspect the <code>WebHostBuilder</code> will be removed completely at some point, even though it hasn't been marked <code>[Obsolete]</code> yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of the re-platforming on top of the generic host, some of the types <a href="https://andrewlock.net/the-asp-net-core-generic-host-namespace-clashes-and-extension-methods/">that were duplicated previously</a> have been marked obsolete, and new types have been introduced. The best example of this is <code>IHostingEnvironment</code>.</p>
<h2 id="ihostingenvironment-vs-ihostenvironment-vs-iwebhostenviornment"><code>IHostingEnvironment</code> vs <code>IHostEnvironment</code> vs <code>IWebHostEnviornment</code><a href="#ihostingenvironment-vs-ihostenvironment-vs-iwebhostenviornment"></a></h2>
<p><code>IHostingEnvironment</code> is one of the most annoying interfaces in .NET Core 2.x, because it exists in two different namespaces, <em>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting</em> and <em>Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting</em>. These are <em>slightly</em> different and are incompatible - one does not inherit from the other. </p>
<pre><code><span>namespace</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>AspNetCore<span>.</span>Hosting
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>IHostingEnvironment</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> EnvironmentName <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>string</span> ApplicationName <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>string</span> WebRootPath <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>IFileProvider</span> WebRootFileProvider <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>string</span> ContentRootPath <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>IFileProvider</span> ContentRootFileProvider <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>namespace</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>Extensions<span>.</span>Hosting
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>IHostingEnvironment</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> EnvironmentName <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>string</span> ApplicationName <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>string</span> ContentRootPath <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>IFileProvider</span> ContentRootFileProvider <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The reason there are two is basically historical - the <em>AspNetCore</em> version existed, and the <em>Extensions</em> version was introduced with the generic host in ASP.NET Core 2.1. The <em>Extensions</em> version has no notion of the <code>wwwroot</code> folder for serving static files (as it's for hosting non-HTTP services), so it lacks the <code>WebRootFileProvider</code> and <code>WebRootPath</code> properties. </p>
<p>A separate abstraction was necessary for backwards-compatibility reasons. But one of the really annoying consequences of this was the inability to write extension methods that worked for both the generic-host and for ASP.NET Core. </p>
<p>In ASP.NET Core 3.0, both of these interfaces are marked obsolete. You can still use them, but you'll get warnings at build time. Instead, two new interfaces have been introduced: <code>IHostEnvironment</code> and <code>IWebHostEnvironment</code>. While they are still in separate namespaces, they now have different names, and one inherits from the other!</p>
<pre><code><span>namespace</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>Extensions<span>.</span>Hosting
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>IHostEnvironment</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> EnvironmentName <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>string</span> ApplicationName <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>string</span> ContentRootPath <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>IFileProvider</span> ContentRootFileProvider <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>namespace</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>AspNetCore<span>.</span>Hosting
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>IWebHostEnvironment</span> <span>:</span> <span>IHostEnvironment</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> WebRootPath <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>IFileProvider</span> WebRootFileProvider <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This hierarchy makes much more sense, avoids duplication, and means methods that can accept the generic-host version of the host environment abstraction (<code>IHostEnvironment</code>) will now work with the web version too (<code>IWebHostEnvironment</code>). Under the hood, the <em>implementations</em> of <code>IHostEnvironment</code> and <code>IWebHostEnvironment</code> are still the same - they just implement the new interfaces in addition to the old ones. For example, <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/v3.0.0/src/Hosting/Hosting/src/Internal/HostingEnvironment.cs">the ASP.NET Core implementation</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>namespace</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>AspNetCore<span>.</span>Hosting
<span>{</span>
    <span>internal</span> <span>class</span> <span>HostingEnvironment</span> <span>:</span> <span>IHostingEnvironment</span><span>,</span> Extensions<span>.</span>Hosting<span>.</span>IHostingEnvironment<span>,</span> IWebHostEnvironment
    <span>{</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>string</span> EnvironmentName <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> Extensions<span>.</span>Hosting<span>.</span>Environments<span>.</span>Production<span>;</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>string</span> ApplicationName <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>string</span> WebRootPath <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>IFileProvider</span> WebRootFileProvider <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>string</span> ContentRootPath <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>IFileProvider</span> ContentRootFileProvider <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So which interface should you use? The short answer is "use <code>IHostEnvironment</code> wherever possible", but the details may vary…</p>
<p><strong>If you're building ASP.NET Core 3.0 apps</strong></p>
<p>Use <code>IHostEnvironment</code> where possible, and use <code>IWebHostEnvironment</code> when you need access to the <code>WebRootPath</code> or <code>WebRootFileProvider</code> properties.</p>
<p><strong>If you're building a library to be used with the generic host and .NET Core 3.0</strong></p>
<p>Use <code>IHostEnvironment</code>. Your library will still work with ASP.NET Core 3.0 apps.</p>
<p><strong>If you're building a library to be used with ASP.NET Core 3.0 apps</strong></p>
<p>As before, it's best to use <code>IHostEnvironment</code> as then your library can potentially be used by other generic host applications, not just ASP.NET Core applications. However, if you need access to the extra properties on <code>IWebHostEnvironment</code> then you'll have to update your library to target <code>netcoreapp3.0</code> instead of <code>netstandard2.0</code> and add a <code>&lt;FrameworkReference&gt;</code> element, <a href="https://andrewlock.net/converting-a-netstandard-2-library-to-netcore-3/#libraries-that-depend-on-asp-net-core-nuget-packages">as described in my previous post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you're building a library to be used with both ASP.NET Core 2.x and 3.0</strong></p>
<p>This is a pain. You basically have two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to use the <em>Microsoft.AspNetCore</em> version of <code>IHostingEnvironment</code>. It will work in both 2.x and 3.0 apps without any issues, you'll just likely have to stop using it in later versions.</li>
<li>Use <code>#ifdef</code> to conditionally compile using the <code>IHostEnvironment</code> in ASP.NET Core 3.0 and <code>IHostingEnvironment</code> in ASP.NET Core 2.0. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="iapplicationlifetime-vs-ihostapplicationlifetime"><code>IApplicationLifetime</code> vs <code>IHostApplicationLifetime</code><a href="#iapplicationlifetime-vs-ihostapplicationlifetime"></a></h2>
<p>A very similar issue of namespace clashes is present for the <code>IApplicationLifetime</code> interface. As with the previous example, this exists in both <em>Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting</em> and <em>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting</em>. In this case however, the interface in both cases is identical:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>namespace</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>Extensions<span>.</span>Hosting
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>IApplicationLifetime</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>CancellationToken</span> ApplicationStarted <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>CancellationToken</span> ApplicationStopped <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>CancellationToken</span> ApplicationStopping <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>void</span> <span>StopApplication</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As you might expect by now, this duplication was a symptom of backwards-compatibility. .NET Core 3.0 introduces a new interface, <code>IHostApplicationLifetime</code> that is defined only in the <em>Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting</em> namespace, but is available both in the generic host and ASP.NET Core apps:</p>
<pre><code><span>namespace</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>Extensions<span>.</span>Hosting
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>IHostApplicationLifetime</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>CancellationToken</span> ApplicationStarted <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>CancellationToken</span> ApplicationStopping <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>CancellationToken</span> ApplicationStopped <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
        <span>void</span> <span>StopApplication</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Again, this interface is identical to the previous version, and the .NET Core 3.0 implementation <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/blob/66007df6e5b68683de0cab0dc6a8552265318f20/src/Hosting/Hosting/src/Internal/ApplicationLifetime.cs">implements both versions as <code>ApplicationLifetime</code></a>. <a href="https://andrewlock.net/introducing-ihostlifetime-and-untangling-the-generic-host-startup-interactions/">As I discussed in my previous post on the startup process</a>, the <code>ApplicationLifetime</code> type plays a key role in generic-host startup and shutdown. Interestingly, there is no real equivalent in <em>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting</em> - the <em>Extensions</em> version handles it all. <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/v3.0.0/src/Hosting/Hosting/src/GenericHost/GenericWebHostApplicationLifetime.cs">The only implementation in the <em>AspNetCore</em> namespace is a simple wrapper type</a> that delegates to the <code>ApplicationLifetime</code> added as part of the generic host:</p>
<pre><code><span>namespace</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>AspNetCore<span>.</span>Hosting
<span>{</span>
    <span>internal</span> <span>class</span> <span>GenericWebHostApplicationLifetime</span> <span>:</span> <span>IApplicationLifetime</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>IHostApplicationLifetime</span> _applicationLifetime<span>;</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>GenericWebHostApplicationLifetime</span><span>(</span><span>IHostApplicationLifetime</span> applicationLifetime<span>)</span>
        <span>{</span>
            _applicationLifetime <span>=</span> applicationLifetime<span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>public</span> <span>CancellationToken</span> ApplicationStarted <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> _applicationLifetime<span>.</span>ApplicationStarted<span>;</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>CancellationToken</span> ApplicationStopping <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> _applicationLifetime<span>.</span>ApplicationStopping<span>;</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>CancellationToken</span> ApplicationStopped <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> _applicationLifetime<span>.</span>ApplicationStopped<span>;</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>StopApplication</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> _applicationLifetime<span>.</span><span>StopApplication</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The decision of which interface to use is, thankfully, much easier for application lifetime rather than hosting environment:</p>
<p><strong>If you're building .NET Core 3.0, or ASP.NET Core 3.0 apps or libraries</strong></p>
<p>Use <code>IHostApplicationLifetime</code>. It only requires <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions">a reference to <em>Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions</em></a>, and is usable in all applications</p>
<p><strong>If you're building a library to be used with both ASP.NET Core 2.x and 3.0</strong></p>
<p><em>Now</em> you're stuck again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <em>Microsoft.Extensions</em> version of <code>IApplicationLifetime</code>. It will work in both 2.x and 3.0 apps without any issues, you'll just likely have to stop using it in later versions.</li>
<li>Use <code>#ifdef</code> to conditionally compile using the <code>IHostApplicationLifetime</code> in ASP.NET Core 3.0 and <code>IApplicationLifetime</code> in ASP.NET Core 2.0. </li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily <code>IApplicationLifetime</code> is generally used much less often than <code>IHostingEnvironment</code>, so you probably won't have too much difficulty with this one.</p>
<h2 id="iwebhost-vs-ihost"><code>IWebHost</code> vs <code>IHost</code><a href="#iwebhost-vs-ihost"></a></h2>
<p>One thing that may surprise you is that the <code>IWebHost</code> interface <em>hasn't</em> been updated to inherit from <code>IHost</code> in ASP.NET Core 3.0. Similarly <code>IWebHostBuilder</code> <em>doesn't</em> inherit from <code>IHostBulider</code>. They are still completely separate interfaces - one for ASP.NET Core, and one for the generic host.</p>
<p>Luckily, that doesn't matter. Now that ASP.NET Core 3.0 has been rebuilt to use the generic host abstractions, you get the best of both worlds. You can write methods that use the generic host <code>IHostBuilder</code> abstractions and share them between your ASP.NET Core and generic host apps. If you need to do something ASP.NET Core specific, you can still use the <code>IWebHostBuilder</code> interface.</p>
<p>For example, consider the two extension methods below, one for <code>IHostBuilder</code>, and one for <code>IWebHostBuilder</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>ExampleExtensions</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>IHostBuilder</span> <span>DoSomethingGeneric</span><span>(</span><span>this</span> <span>IHostBuilder</span> builder<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        <span>return</span> builder<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>IWebHostBuilder</span> <span>DoSomethingWeb</span><span>(</span><span>this</span> <span>IWebHostBuilder</span> builder<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        <span>return</span> builder<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>One of the methods does some sort of configuration on the generic host (maybe it registers some services with DI for example), and the other does some configuration on the <code>IWebHostBuilder</code>. Perhaps it sets some defaults for the Kestrel server for example. </p>
<p>If you create a brand-new ASP.NET Core 3.0 application, your <em>Program.cs</em> will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Program</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> args<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>CreateHostBuilder</span><span>(</span>args<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>IHostBuilder</span> <span>CreateHostBuilder</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> args<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
        Host<span>.</span><span>CreateDefaultBuilder</span><span>(</span>args<span>)</span>
            <span>.</span><span>ConfigureWebHostDefaults</span><span>(</span>webBuilder <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
            <span>{</span>
                webBuilder
                    <span>.</span><span><span>UseStartup</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Startup</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
            <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can add calls to both your extension methods by adding one call on the generic <code>IHostBuilder</code>, and the other inside <code>ConfigureWebHostDefaults()</code>, on the <code>IWebHostBuilder</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Program</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> args<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>CreateHostBuilder</span><span>(</span>args<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<p>The fact you can make calls on both builder types in ASP.NET Core 3.0 means you can now build libraries that rely solely on generic-host abstractions, and can reuse them in ASP.NET Core apps. You can then layer on the ASP.NET Core-specific behaviour on top, without having to duplicate methods like you did in 2.x.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary"></a></h2>
<p>In this post I discussed some of the types that have been made obsolete in ASP.NET Core 3.0, where they've moved to, and why. If you're updating an application to ASP.NET Core 3.0 you don't <em>have</em> to replace them, as they will still behave the same for now. But they'll be replaced in a future version, so it makes sense to update them if you can. In some cases it also makes it easier to share code between your apps, so it's worth looking in to.</p>
