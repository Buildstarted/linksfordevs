<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span data-hook="review-body"><div aria-live="polite" data-a-expander-name="review_text_read_more" data-a-expander-collapsed-height="300"><p><span>I'm going to be brutally honest here -the keyboard has it's flaws, but is solid nonetheless.<p>As with most Amazon reviews, the truth tends to lie within the lower scoring reviews.  The copy that I received had symptoms that were described in all the 1-3 star reviews: squeaky backspace, yellowing of the keycaps, and audible vibration carried through the chassis from keypresses.</p><p>However, none of these facets are deal breakers.  If you are a frequent user of your keyboard (which you should be, otherwise why else would you be looking at a $150 mechanical keyboard), you would know that you can resolve most of these issues by purchasing new keycaps and adjusting / replacing the springs.  Not much can be done about the vibration, but that's the price you pay for having a solid metal backplate.  That being said, for something that costs so much, it kind of sucks to have to endure these issues for the price point.</p><p>I'm coming from a Das Keyboard Professional with Cherry MX Blues -which can be had for ~$50 less, but does not have backlighting and is significantly less sturdy.</p><p>The clears live up to their word.  The switches are much quieter than their blue counterparts, and they require a bit more force to actuate.  So far, the keyboard is pleasant to type on.  They aren't like the Blues, but that is to be expected.</p><p>The backlighting is nice, and is on par with other backlit keyboards that I have owned (Logitech Illuminated).</p><p>The dip switches in the back are also nice, giving quite a bit of flexibility for operating systems, key configurations, and functionality.  I'm surprised that more keyboards do not come with this feature.</p><p>The detachable usb cable is also a nice touch, as it is super easy to extend the cable length if necessary.</p><p>The lack of USB ports is fine, as I have a number of USB hubs already connected to my PC.  In fact, the Das Keyboard consumed two USB ports on my PC, which was kind of annoying.  I'm not hurting for more USB ports.</p><p>All in all, the keyboard is a solid 4.  The main complaints are all valid, but can be resolved.  The progressive thought put into this keyboard more than makes up for its shortcomings, and the keyboard does what it says it does.  If manufacturing tightened up, this keyboard would easily earn a 5 star review.</p></span>
