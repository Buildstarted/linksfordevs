Intel's press release also says that yields for its 7nm process are now twelve months behind the company's internal targets, meaning the company isn't currently on track to produce its 7nm process in an economically viable way.&nbsp;The company now says its 7nm CPUs will not debut on the market until late 2022 or early 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the snippet from Intel's press release:</p><p>"The company's 7nm-based CPU product timing is shifting approximately six months relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of Intel's 7nm process, which based on recent data, is now trending approximately twelve months behind the company's internal target."</p><p>On the earnings call, Intel CEO Bob Swan said the company had identified a "defect mode" in its 7nm process that caused yield degradation issues. As a result, Intel has invested in "contingency plans," which Swan later defined as using third-party foundries. The company will also use external third-party foundries as a contingency plan for its <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-announces-ponte-vecchio-graphics-cards-sapphire-rapids-cpus-and-data-center-roadmap" data-component-tracked="1">forthcoming 7nm Ponte Vecchio GPUs</a>, the company's first graphics chips. Swan noted the GPUs will come in late 2021 or early 2022, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-exascale-aurora-supercomputer-xe-graphics,38851.html" data-component-tracked="1">portending a delay beyond the original schedule for a 2021 launch</a> in the exascale Aurora supercomputer. Ponte Vecchio comes as a chiplet-based design, and Swan clarified that some of the production for the chiplets (tiles) will be outsourced to third parties.&nbsp;</p><p>Intel also says that its first 10nm desktop CPUs, Alder Lake, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-says-first-10nm-desktop-cpus-land-in-second-half-of-2021" data-component-tracked="1">will arrive in the second half of 2021</a>, and its first 7nm server CPUs (Granite Rapids) will arrive in 2023, a delay from <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-server-ddr5-pcie-5.0-roadmap-leaked-granite-rapids,39403.html" data-component-tracked="1">earlier roadmaps that projected a launch in 2022</a>. Swan indicated that Intel's first 7nm processors will debut for the client market, meaning chips targeting either desktop PCs or laptops.</p><p>For perspective, rival foundry TSMC plans to be on the 3nm node in the same time frame as Intel's new schedule for 7nm. Intel clearly isn't pleased with its execution on the 7nm node, as an embattled Swan remarked that "I'm not happy, I'm not pleased, with our 7nm performance" at the end of the call after a bruising question and answer session with analysts. Swan also said "we have root-caused the [7nm] issue and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks" and that the company would provide further updates at an upcoming <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-sunny-cove-gen11-xe-gpu-foveros,5932.html" data-component-tracked="1">Architecture Day</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It's unclear how Intel will reconcile a six month delay to its 7nm processors with the year-long delay to its internal 7nm yield projections, but Swan said the company had a built-in buffer in its roadmap to account for process node delays. That accomodation comes as a result of hard-learned lessons from the company's incessant 10nm delays.</p><p>The 7nm delay reflects yet another setback as Intel still struggles to overcome the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-cpu-10nm-earnings-amd,36967.html" data-component-tracked="1">multi-year yield issues it has encountered with its 10nm process</a>. Those delays have allowed its competitors, like AMD, to seize an opportunity to wrest the process node leadership position from Intel for the first time in the company's history.&nbsp;That's <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-vs-intel-cpu-market-share-7nm-makes-landfall-as-price-war-begins" data-component-tracked="1">triggered a price war in the market as Intel fights a true x86 competitor</a> with a better node, not to mention Amazon's new <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amazon-web-services-takes-on-intel-with-64-core-arm-graviton2" data-component-tracked="1">Graviton 2 ARM chips based on TSMC's 7nm node</a>. Apple also recently announced that it is <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/apple-arm-intel-transition#:~:text=Apple%20Will%20Move%20Macs%20to%20Custom%20Silicon%2C%20Details%20Transition%20From%20Intel,-By%20Andrew%20E&amp;text=Apple%20is%20transitioning%20its%20Mac,the%20new%20chip%20'Apple%20Silicon." data-component-tracked="1">transitioning from Intel's chips to its own ARM-based 7nm silicon</a>. The announcement also exacerbates the recent news that rock star chip architect Jim Keller, who was a key part of a team effort to revitalize the company's roadmaps, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intels-jim-keller-resigns-will-assist-with-transition" data-component-tracked="1">has left the company.</a>&nbsp;</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 602px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC-970-80.jpg.webp 970w" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC.jpg"><source type="image/jpeg" alt="" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 602px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC-970-80.jpg 970w" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC.jpg" alt="" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 602px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC-970-80.jpg 970w" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y2KRLFYWJonUqz8TWoHQC-970-80.jpg 970w"></picture></p><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Intel CFO George Davis has previously indicated that the company's process tech <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-process-tech-lag-competitors-late-2021-leadership-5nm" data-component-tracked="1">would lag its its competitors until 2021 until 7nm arrived in 2021</a>, and that the company would regain the lead with its 5nm process at an undefined time:</p><p>"So we bring a lot of capability to the table for our customers, in addition to the CPU, and we feel like we're starting to see the acceleration on the process side that we have been talking about to get back to parity in the 7nm generation and regain leadership in the 5nm generation."</p><p>"As we said back at our analyst day in May of 19: Look, this isn't just going to be the best node that Intel has ever had. It's going to be less productive than 14nm, less productive than 22nm, but we're excited about the improvements that we're seeing and we expect to start the 7nm period with a much better profile of performance over that starting at the end of 2021."</p><p>That plan to regain a competitive footing has now obviously shifted due to the 7nm delay. Intel had planned to speed the delivery of its 7nm node to offset the underperforming 10nm, which it said would not perform as well as other nodes. At the time, Davis noted that the company was trying to be clear with investors about the impacts of 10nm on the company's gross margins: "...but the fact is that I wanted to be clear what was happening during the 10nm generation. The fact is, it isn't going to be as strong a node as people would expect from 14nm or what they'll see in 7nm."</p><p>"Also, we were at a time when in order to regain process leadership we had to accelerate the overlap between 10nm, 7nm, and then 7nm and 5nm, so the cost that you're absorbing, starting in particular in 2021, you’ve got this intersection of the performance of 10nm, the investment in 7nm, and were also well into starting the investment in 5nm: All of those elements just combine to impact gross margin."</p><p>This news was just released in Intel's financial earnings with no forewarning and the company says it will announce more details during its earnings call, so we're digging deeper. The company has its earnings briefing shortly and we've reached out for further context. We'll update this post as we learn more. &nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Breaking news...more to come..</strong></em></p>
