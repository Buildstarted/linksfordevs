Attempting to twiddle these values in isolation does not seem likely to help (although I agree PeakWorkingSet64 could surely return WorkingSet64 rather than 0...) and/or may make things worse.</p><p>I would like us to understand what the customer scenario is and how they expect to achieve it. For example, is the app trying to adjust the size of its own working set (eg., by releasing cached objects) to avoid getting OOM-killer-ed? If so what API are they using today -- or what API would we recommend they look at, and how should they use it?</p></div></div></div></div>
