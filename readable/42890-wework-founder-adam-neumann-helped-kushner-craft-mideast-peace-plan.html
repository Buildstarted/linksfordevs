    <h1>WeWork founder Adam Neumann &#x27;helped Kushner craft Mideast peace plan&#x27;</h1>
    <section id="article-entry" class="content as--tight"> <p class="t-body-text">The rise and catastrophic downfall of WeWork founder&#xA0;and former CEO Adam Neumann has been chronicled in gleeful detail across the international financial press in the wake of his company&#x2019;s ill-fated attempt at a public offering&#xA0;&#x2014; which resulted in disastrous revelations about the company&#x2019;s mismanagement, its devaluation and, ultimately, Neumann&#x2019;s resignation. </p> <p class="t-body-text">But a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/inside-the-fall-of-wework">new Vanity Fair article</a>&#xA0;by Gabriel Sherman, titled &#x201C;Inside the Fall of WeWork,&#x201D; asserts that Neumann&#x2019;s &#x201C;millennial entitlement gone insane&#x201D; and guru-like &#x201C;egomaniacal glamour&#x201D; extended beyond the business world and into the world of Middle East diplomacy. </p> <p class="t-body-text">Neumann, according to the Vanity Fair article, believed that <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/wework-ceo-neumann-expected-to-step-down-reports-say-1.7898526">WeWork</a> &#x201C;was even capable of solving the world&#x2019;s thorniest problems. Last summer, some WeWork executives were shocked to discover Neumann was working on Jared Kushner&#x2019;s Mideast peace effort. According to two sources, Neumann assigned WeWork&#x2019;s director of development, Roni Bahar, to hire an advertising firm to produce a slick video for Kushner that would showcase what an economically transformed West Bank and Gaza would look like.&#x201D; </p> <div class="h-mb emb-wrapper"> <figure class=" emb-wrapper emb-wrapper--bandCamp " id> <figcaption class="pic__caption">Haaretz Weekly Ep. 50<span class="pic__credit">Haaretz </span></figcaption> </figure> </div> <p class="t-body-text">Kushner, he added, &#x201C;showed a version of the video during his speech at the White House&#x2019;s peace conference in Bahrain last summer.&#x201D; </p> <p class="t-body-text">Sherman reported that Neumann also told his colleagues &#x201C;that he was saving the women of Saudi Arabia by working with <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-mohammed-bin-salman-1.6173795">Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman</a> to offer women coding classes.&#x201D; </p> <p class="t-body-text">Finally, an anecdote that <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-what-saudi-arabia-s-mbs-and-wework-s-adam-neumann-have-in-common-1.7883777">connected Neumann both to Kushner and the Saudi prince</a> involved a claim by Neumann that three people were going to save the world: Crown Prince Mohammed, Jared Kushner and Neumann himself. </p> <p class="t-body-text">Then, after October 18, 2018, when it came to light that &#x201C;Saudi agents tortured dissident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and carved his body with a bone saw, likely <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/khashoggi-murder-happened-under-my-watch-saudi-crown-prince-admits-1.7910231">on order from the crown prince himself</a>, Neumann told George W. Bush&#x2019;s former national security adviser Stephen Hadley that everything could be worked out if bin Salman had the right mentor. Confused, Hadley asked who that person might be, according to a source familiar with the meeting. Neumann paused for a moment and said: &#x2018;Me.&#x2019;&#x201D; </p> <aside class="t-body-text"> <header> </header> </aside> <div class="newsletter newsletterInarticle newsletterBox has-modal islet h-hidden--to-l h-mb"> <div id="newsletter-success_9518358" class="newsletter__success"> <p class="t-delta h-mb">We&apos;ve got more newsletters we think you&apos;ll find interesting.</p> <a class="btn" href="/misc/newsletters-page">Click here</a> </div> <div id="newsletter-error_9518358" class="newsletter__error"> <p class="t-delta h-mb">Please try again later.</p> </div> </div> <p class="t-body-text">The Vanity Fair piece quoted a former WeWork executive explaining his former boss&#x2019; delusions of diplomatic grandeur, saying that &#x201C;when Adam got in front of world leaders, it was like he started thinking he was one.&#x201D; In this vein, the executive said, Neumann ended up &#x201C;discussing the Syrian refugee crisis with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and urban planning with London Mayor Sadiq Khan.&#x201D; </p> <aside class="[ content__el content__aside ] author-info has-block-link"> <a href="/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4969038" class="block-link"></a> </aside> </section>
