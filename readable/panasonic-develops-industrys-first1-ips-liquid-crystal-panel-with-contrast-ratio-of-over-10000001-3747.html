        <p>OSAKA, Japan--(<span itemprop="provider publisher copyrightHolder" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" itemid="https://www.businesswire.com"><span itemprop="name"><a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" rel="nofollow" itemprop="url" href="https://www.businesswire.com/">BUSINESS WIRE</a></span></span>)--Panasonic Liquid Crystal Display Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Panasonic 
      Corporation, today announced it has developed a new model of its IPS 
      liquid crystal panel that achieves a contrast ratio<sup>[1]</sup> of 
      over 1,000,000:1, which is 600 times<sup>*2</sup> that of conventional 
      liquid crystal panels. With Panasonic's unique IPS<sup>[2]</sup> liquid 
      crystal technologies that feature wide viewing angles, high brightness, 
      and high reliability, the new IPS panel has achieved a high contrast 
      ratio of over 1,000,000:1 by integrating newly developed 
      light-modulating cells that permit pixel-by-pixel control of backlight 
      intensity. This achieves a faithful and high-grade video display, 
      ranging from dazzling light to pitch-black.

    <p>
      The new IPS panel is ideal for use in professional-use High Dynamic 
      Range (HDR) monitors for broadcasting stations and video production 
      studios. HDR displays can reproduce images that are faithful to what 
      people see, ranging from bright light to jet-black darkness. Also, the 
      new high-contrast panel is suitable for use such as medical monitors 
      that require faithful video display and automotive monitors that require 
      clear visibility without black floating<sup>[3]</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Panasonic's new IPS Liquid Crystal Panel has the following features:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        An industry-first high contrast ratio of over 1,000,000:1, which is 
        600 times that of conventional products
      </li>
      <li>
        Capable of stable operation at a maximum brightness of 1,000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        Can be manufactured using existing liquid crystal panel manufacturing 
        facilities
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The new high-contrast IPS panel solves the problems inherent in 
      conventional liquid crystal panels. Despite their track record in 
      wide-ranging applications from B-to-C to B-to-B fields, conventional 
      liquid crystal panels suffer black floating, white washout phenomenon, 
      in dark parts of the display area when the backlight intensity is 
      increased to raise brightness. When the backlight intensity is lowered 
      to make dark parts clearer, these panels also suffer a loss in sparkle 
      in bright parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Suitable applications:</b><br>High-end monitors for broadcasting, 
      video production, medical, automotive, and other fields
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sample availability:</b><br>Sample shipment will start in January 
      2017.

          Panasonicâ€™s new high-contrast IPS panel uses newly developed 
          light-modulating cells, which operate based on the operating 
          principle of liquid crystals, and these cells are integrated into 
          the display cells. As a result, it is capable of controlling the 
          amount of backlight entering the display cells pixel by pixel, thus 
          achieving a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1.

          The light-modulating cells are composed of a liquid crystal material 
          that differs in light-transmission properties from that used in the 
          display cells, allowing independent control of the display and 
          light-modulating cells. This has reduced light leakage 
          significantly, allowing finely-tuned gradation expression. 
          Furthermore, the application of Panasonic's IPS liquid crystal 
          technologies, developed for industrial use, has achieved a contrast 
          of 1,000,000:1 (maximum brightness: 1,000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, minimum 
          brightness: 0.001 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) while maintaining features 
          including wide viewing angles and high light-transmission efficiency.

          The new high-contrast IPS panel achieves a maximum brightness of 
          1,000 cd/m<sup>2</sup> by enhancing the transmittance of the display 
          and light-modulating cells and adopting a high-brightness backlight. 
          For the light-modulating cells, the company has developed a 
          light-tolerant material that provides stable operation over a long 
          period of time, despite exposure to intense light from the 
          high-brightness backlight, as well as a unique cell structure.
