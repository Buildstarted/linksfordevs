Through a series of card games, Dipyaman has been working with the leaders of local para clubs to question the relevance of conservation in the context of their lives today.</p><hr><p class="artist-bio">Dipyaman Kar is a practicing artist and has been trained as a sculptor. He has studied Visual art, at the faculty of fine arts Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata and Cardiff School of Art and Design, Cardiff, UK. He was one of the recipients of the Charles Wallace scholarship in the year of 2009-10. He was awarded with the National Scholarship by the ministry of culture &amp; human resource, Govt of India in 2012. He has participated in an Artist residency Program at Arrau, Switzerland, supported by the khoj Kolkata Artist’s initiative and Arbeitsgruppe Gasteatelier Krone, Aarau, and has taken part in Khoj International artists Workshops in 2006, various exhibitions in India and Switzerland. His interest as an artist is, to explore extended possibilities of sculpture. This in turn primarily, leads him to investigate ‘space,’ as an essential element in sculpture. His study looks into the idea of space as a framework constituting of the unquantifiable elements. Hence, his artistic endeavor tries to negotiate with issues and areas like, discarded spaces, space of transit, built spaces, space in writing, and history of cartography and so on. Dipyaman lives and works in Kolkata.</p></div></div></div></div>
