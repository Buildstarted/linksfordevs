This new identity aligns with our new focus — to provide the ultimate workflow for developing, previewing, and shipping Jamstack sites.</p></div><h2 data-components-heading="true"><span id="our-origins"></span><a href="#our-origins">Our Origins</a><span><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="0.75em" height="0.75em" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" style="color:currentColor"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 007.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 00-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 00-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 007.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></span></h2><div><p>In 2016, we started with a simple goal: empowering solo developers to effortlessly deploy their apps.</p></div><div><p>There is an overwhelming layer of technology and terminology in web development: domain setup with DNS and SSL, networking with TCP and HTTP, caching with CDN and Edge Networks... it's a huge list. It creates much complexity.</p></div><div><p>Our first product, <code>now</code>, focused on simplifying deployments:</p></div><div><!-- -->
	


	<p>The original tweet announcing `now`. With a single command, we helped <br> developers get their apps and services live, inclusive of SSL and built-in routing.</p>
</div><div><p>
Developers loved <code>now</code>. Tired of boilerplate, they appreciated the ability to trivially deploy, share, and scale their apps. The positive response was motivating — we were stoked!</p></div><div><p>Since then, we have invested all our energy into building products that simplify developer experience. Our open-source React framework <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Next.js</a> is the most notable of them. At organizations big and small, it has become <i>the </i>framework to build React apps due to its simple learning curve, versatility, and performance.</p></div><div><p>Today, Next.js powers over <b>35,000 sites</b> at companies like Uber, Nike, and Starbucks.</p></div><div><figure src="https://assets.zeit.co/image/upload/f_auto,q_80/v1587431671/random/next-brands-test.png"><main></main></figure>

</p></div><div><p>In these 4 years, ZEIT has gone from being a simple idea to a thriving community. 300,000+ frontend engineers and designers are using our technology to bring their ideas to life — whether company websites, SaaS products, or personal blogs.</p></div><h2 data-components-heading="true"><span id="our-renewed-focus-develop.-preview.-ship"></span><a href="#our-renewed-focus-develop.-preview.-ship">Our Renewed Focus: Develop.

Frameworks like <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Next.js</a> eliminate boilerplate, and serverless APIs give them <b>full-stack powers</b>.</p></div><div><p>Projects that once took months to develop, are getting completed by lean teams of frontend engineers and designers in days. These teams want to iterate rapidly, and collaboratively. They want to develop, preview, and ship at the speed of thought. They don't want to leave their browsers, and other tools they're already working with. That's where we come in.
</p></div><div><p>We enable teams<b> </b>to <b>develop</b>,<b> preview</b>,<b> </b>and<b> ship </b>their apps<b> </b>faster, and with confidence.</p></div><div><p>For teams, Vercel closes the gap between development, feedback and release phase. Anyone can set up Vercel in a couple of clicks — no DevOps knowledge necessary.</p></div><div><p>We use Vercel to build Vercel. We are constantly examining every interaction in own team workflow, and are obsessed about removing every little source of friction.
 </p></div><div><p>We have already introduced multiple updates focused on teams.
