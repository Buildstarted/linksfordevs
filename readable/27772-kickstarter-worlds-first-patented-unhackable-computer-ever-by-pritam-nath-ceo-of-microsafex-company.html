<p><strong>My Story.</strong></p>
<br>
<p><strong>My educational background and experience.</strong></p>
<p>I have a degree in Electronic Hardware from UCLA and over 35 years of experience in Systems Architecture, Large Integrated Software Systems and some Hardware in various computers, Internet, Operating Systems, BIOS, Device Drivers, Embedded Systems, etc.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>My work with several US corporations.</strong></p>
<p>Few years ago I got into Engineering consulting business. &#xA0;Various US corporations like Dantel Corporation, Polycom Inc., Lear Astronics, Ametek Aerospace Corp., Philips Consumer Electronics Company, Hughes Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Co. etc. hired me to solve a specific engineering problem. &#xA0;In each case their engineering staff either could not solve a problem on hand or there were no skills available in house to tackle it. &#xA0;I was paid well for those assignments.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>What am I planning to make?</strong></p>
<p>&#x201C;UNHACKABLE COMPUTER&#x201D; which cannot be hacked in any way whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>Where did the idea come from?</strong></p>
<p>In a dream.&#xA0;</p>
<p>I was repeatedly a victim of hackers. If you were hacked as well, you can relate to the nightmare that one undergoes, the helplessness, the loss of time, money, efficiency, and confidence.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Realizing how wide spread the problem is drove me to find a solution. I talked to tech support people at several cyber security companies. &#xA0;The response was very discouraging. &#xA0;&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not possible to stop hacking.&#x201D;, was the recurring comment<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>In my research, I found out that all the PC manufacturers follow the IBM Personal computer design that IBM came out with in the 1980s.</p>
<p>For months, I was obsessed with the problem. One thing became clear that &#x201C;Software Alone solution&#x201D; would not end the hacking problem. &#xA0;A Hardware-and-Software solution was needed. &#xA0;Most computer engineers specialize in either Hardware or Software.</p>
<p>Luckily, I have an in depth knowledge of Software and Hardware. Then suddenly, the solution came to me in my dream. &#xA0;I woke up and wrote it down. &#xA0;I went through hundreds of &#x201C;what if&#x201D; scenarios.</p>
<p>So, I came up with a new hardware design of Personal Computer where the computer processing is done in one hardware compartment and the Internet processing in another, both completely separate from each other. Nothing in the Internet processing area is allowed to go to computer processing area. &#xA0;If a virus gets into the Internet processing area it cannot affect the computer processing area in any way whatsoever. The computer is always working. &#xA0;In worst case, the user turns off the computer and the virus is gone. It is the two hardware compartments that make the computer Unhackable.</p>
<p>The US Patent office granted me patent No. US 10,061,923 B1 for this computer.</p>
<p><strong>What&#x2019;s my Plan and Schedule?</strong></p>
<p>My plan is to build the Unhackable Computer in the first three months.</p>
<p>While I am building the computer with a hardware engineer, a software engineer would be working on the Operating System to be installed on the computer. &#xA0;</p>
<p>All three of us would be testing the computer in next three months.</p>
<p>In six months the computer would be ready for the world. &#xA0;Then, to ascertain the computer&#x2019;s unhackability, we would beta test it in the real world environment for another three months. &#xA0;In the next three months arrangements would be made with various established computer manufacturers to manufacture this new computer on contractual basis.</p>
<p>After 12 months the computer would be ready for shipping, first to the esteemed supporters who put down their deposits, and then to all other patrons.</p>
<p><strong>What is my budget?</strong></p>
<p>The bare minimum budget to build and test this new computer is estimated to be $870,000. &#xA0;Any amount above will help expedite the process and scale production.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I care?</strong></p>
<p>I care very deeply because these cyber criminals are making everyone&#x2019;s life miserable. The problem of hacking is affecting all of us in many ways. &#xA0;Some loose their money. &#xA0;Some loose their private information. &#xA0;That information is used to defraud us in several ways. &#xA0;Some are subjected to ransom demands. &#xA0;We are being spied upon without our knowledge. Enough is enough. &#xA0;This Unhackable Computer would put an end to it<strong>.</strong></p>
</div><div class="mb3 mb10-sm mb3 js-risks"> <p>I don&apos;t see any foreseeable risks involved in building this Unhackable Computer.
Because:
It only uses currently available components in the USA and other countries.
All the materials used are readily available in the market.
No new materials of any kind.
I have the source code for all the system software that is needed for the functioning of this computer.
</p><p>In other words, I have all I need to build this fully functioning Unhackable Computer. I would need the help of a couple of experienced hardware and software engineers. I have a complete vision for this project. I have done this before and I don&apos;t see any potential problems at this point.</p></div></div>
