    <section>
      <p>We are pushing full steam ahead to take <em>The Machinery</em> from its current <em>alpha</em> state into <em>beta</em>.
We’ll be writing more about going into <em>beta</em> and what that means in the near future. Today, I will
instead share the first part of a mini-series of blog posts covering a few editor features that sit
somewhere in the borderland between rendering and editor code, or more precisely:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grid rendering</li>
<li>Mouse picking</li>
<li>Selection highlighting</li>
</ul>

<p>I might add to this list if I end up working on something more in this area that feels interesting
to write about.</p>

<p>In common for all three of the topics above is that they have been itching for attention in the back
of my head for quite some time now. While we’ve had some kind of half-assed solution for them in
<em>The Machinery</em> editor, I’ve been painfully aware that they’ve definitely been in need of some love.
Yet I’ve struggled with finding the motivation and time to replace the existing solutions with
something better, but as we are getting ready to ship our beta we really want the first impression
when starting to work with the editor to feel nice, so the time for procrastination is over.</p>

<p>Ironically when I finally put aside some time to work on this, all three turned out much easier to
significantly improve than I had anticipated.</p>

<p>In this first part, we’ll be talking rendering of grids. To be honest I hadn’t really thought much
about rendering a decent looking grid before we started Our Machinery. Instead, I’ve somewhat
arrogantly just consider it being the problem for a tools programmer to solve. While they usually
did an excellent job implementing various types of snapping tools and grids, they never got any
attention or help visualize them nicely. Typically that meant they resolved to using some basic
debug line drawing API. Not only was this bad from a performance point of view, it usually also
meant the grid lines lacked any kind of anti-aliasing, because who cares about the visual quality of
debug lines?</p>

<p>Since one of our main objectives with Our Machinery is to figure out how to architect engine
technology in a way that makes tools development faster and hopefully also bridge the knowledge gap
between tools programmers and “runtime” programmers, at least to some extent, I figured it would
make sense to share how I implemented the current grid renderer that we will roll out in the soon to
be released beta of <em>The Machinery</em>.</p>

<p>First, let’s take a look at our requirements for grid rendering:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We want a simple API to use from the editor code that allows rendering of one or multiple grids in
one or many viewports.</p></li>

<li><p>We want to be able to freely specify grid size, transform, cell size, as well and color without
having to care too much about any potential performance impact.</p></li>

<li><p>We want to be able to highlight every tenth line to increase the readability of the grid.</p></li>

<li><p>We want the grid lines to be rendered with anti-aliasing.</p></li>

<li><p>We want the grid to look pleasant from any viewpoint (i.e we want as little
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern">moire</a> as possible).</p></li>

<li><p>We want the grid to fade out as it reaches its extents.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s take a look at the C-API:</p>

<pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>tm_visual_grid_t</span>
{
    
    <span>tm_mat44_t</span> tm;
    
    <span>float</span> grid_size;
    
    <span>float</span> cell_size;
    
    <span>tm_color_srgb_t</span> thin_lines_color;
    
    <span>tm_color_srgb_t</span> thick_lines_color;
} <span>tm_visual_grid_t</span>;

<span>struct</span> tm_grid_renderer_api
{
    <span>void</span> (*render)(<span>const</span> <span>tm_visual_grid_t</span> *grid,
        <span>const</span> <span>struct</span> tm_shader_system_context_o *context, 
        <span>struct</span> tm_shader_o *grid_shader, 
        <span>struct</span> tm_renderer_resource_command_buffer_o *res_buf, 
        <span>struct</span> tm_renderer_command_buffer_o *cmd_buf);
};
</code></pre>

<p>From an editor point of view, we only have to care about <code>tm_visual_grid_t</code> which is a POD struct.
Currently, we only support specifying quadratic grid extents and cell sizes, there’s nothing
stopping us from handling nonsquare extents (or cell sizes) but I fail to see any case you ever want
that so I opted for minimalism. As we render grids after post-processing and tone mapping, it makes
the most sense to specify the colors in 8-bit sRGB color space, making the color space consistent
with the rest of the UI code.</p>

<p>When it’s time to render the viewport <code>tm_grid_renderer_api</code><code>-&gt;</code><code>render()</code> is called for each grid
the editor wants to draw. Internally this API doesn’t do anything else than writing the contents of
<code>tm_visual_grid_t</code> to a constant buffer owned by the <code>grid_shader</code> and issuing a draw call with 6
vertices. The rest happens in the shader.</p>

<p>In the vertex shader the 6 vertices are interpreted as the corners of two triangles spanning the
extents of the grid in X,Z plane (we use a right-handed Y+ up coordinate system in <em>The Machinery</em>).
Input to the pixel shader is the interpolated 2D grid coordinates going from { -extent, -extent } to
{ extent, extent }.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the code for the pixel shader:</p>

<pre><code>
float2 uv = input.grid_position;


float2 dudv = float2(length(float2(ddx(uv.x), ddy(uv.x))), 
    length(float2(ddx(uv.y), ddy(uv.y))) );       


<span>const</span> <span>float</span> min_pixels_between_cells = <span>1.f</span>;



<span>float</span> cs = load_cell_size();


<span>float</span> lod_level = max(<span>0</span>, <span>log10</span>((length(dudv) * min_pixels_between_cells) / cs) + <span>1</span>);
<span>float</span> lod_fade = frac(lod_level);


<span>float</span> lod0_cs = cs * <span>pow</span>(<span>10</span>, <span>floor</span>(lod_level));
<span>float</span> lod1_cs = lod0_cs * <span>10.f</span>;
<span>float</span> lod2_cs = lod1_cs * <span>10.f</span>;


dudv *= <span>2</span>;


float2 lod0_cross_a = <span>1.f</span> - <span>abs</span>(saturate(<span>fmod</span>(uv, lod0_cs) / dudv) * <span>2</span> - <span>1.f</span>);

<span>float</span> lod0_a = max(lod0_cross_a.x, lod0_cross_a.y);
float2 lod1_cross_a = <span>1.f</span> - <span>abs</span>(saturate(<span>fmod</span>(uv, lod1_cs) / dudv) * <span>2</span> - <span>1.f</span>);
<span>float</span> lod1_a = max(lod1_cross_a.x, lod1_cross_a.y);
float2 lod2_cross_a = <span>1.f</span> - <span>abs</span>(saturate(<span>fmod</span>(uv, lod2_cs) / dudv) * <span>2</span> - <span>1.f</span>);
<span>float</span> lod2_a = max(lod2_cross_a.x, lod2_cross_a.y);


float4 thin_color = load_thin_lines_color();
float4 thick_color = load_thick_lines_color();


float4 c = lod2_a &gt; <span>0</span> ? thick_color : lod1_a &gt; <span>0</span> ? lerp(thick_color, thin_color, lod_fade) : thin_color;


float3 view_dir = normalize(input.view_dir);
<span>float</span> op_gracing = <span>1.f</span> - <span>pow</span>(<span>1.f</span> - <span>abs</span>(dot(view_dir, load_tm()<span>._</span>m10_m11_m12)), <span>16</span>);
<span>float</span> op_distance = (<span>1.f</span> - saturate(length(uv) / load_grid_size()));
<span>float</span> op = op_gracing * op_distance;


c.a *= (lod2_a &gt; <span>0</span> ? lod2_a : lod1_a &gt; <span>0</span> ? lod1_a : (lod0_a * (<span>1</span>-lod_fade))) * op;

output.color = c;  
</code></pre>

<p>For the experienced shader programmer, this code is probably fairly self-explanatory (and I’m sure
there might be better or more efficient ways to implement this, feel free to enlighten me). For the
rest of you, I’ll do a walk-through:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We start by finding the length of the derivatives (ddx/ddy) of the current grid coordinate. This
is essentially how much we move in grid space from one pixel to the next.</p></li>

<li><p>Since we had a requirement of being able to specify any cell size (in world units, which in The
Machinery is <em>meters</em>) without having to care about the location of the viewer we need some kind
of automatic Level-Of-Detail (LOD) to avoid ending up in moire hell. We define the LOD
transition metric to be the minimum allowed distance in pixels between two cell lines
(<code>min_pixels_between_cells</code>) before the line has completely faded out and the transition to the
next LOD-step has fully occurred. Since we highlight the gridline between every tenth cell it
makes sense to use that to define a LOD-step. This is where the <code>log10()</code> and <code>pow(10,
lod_level)</code> comes from, for each LOD level we will cover <em>10^lod_level x</em> more cells of the
smallest size (<code>cell_size</code> in <code>tm_visual_grid_t</code>).</p></li>

<li><p>Since we want to blend between the LOD-steps we’ll calculate grid line coverage for the three
different cell sizes (<code>lod0_cs</code>, <code>lod1_cs</code>, <code>lod2_cs</code>) calculated in (2). The cell size is
essentially the frequency at which a new line should be visible. It’s easier to show graphically
exactly what’s going on when calculating the coverage value, therefor eI’ve created a small
<a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hy8n1oqy6v">demos graph</a>.</p>

<p>In the graph <em>w</em> is the line width (<code>dudv</code> in the code above) and <em>c</em> is the line frequency
(<code>lod0_cs, lod1_cs, lod2_cs</code>). The demos graph works in 1D but we are working on the grid plane
in 2D with grid lines crossing each other, so we simply take the maximum coverage of X,Y and use
that as out <em>alpha mask</em> value for each LOD-step (<code>lod0_a, lod1_a, lod2_a</code>).</p></li>

<li><p>This is fairly handwavy, but essentially here we simply calculate the fade between the thin and
thick line colors based on the <code>lod_fade</code> and how much we consider the current pixel belongs to a
certain LOD-step using the coverage alpha values calculated in (3).</p></li>

<li><p>Calculates opacity fade-out for all grid lines based on viewing angle and distance to the center
of the graph. This is a bit temporary and will likely be tweaked further, some knobs might need
to get exposed in <code>tm_visual_grid_t</code> .</p></li>

<li><p>Lastly, we modulate the final alpha value of the pixel with another handwavy mix of the line
coverage masks for the three LOD-steps and multiply the whole shebang with the opacity value
calculated in (5).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it. A nice looking grid. Implement one yourself or check it out in our beta release coming
soon.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> In a future post I might follow up with some floating-point precision considerations to be
aware of when using this technique, and maybe something about playing nicely with depth testing
against your TAA-jittered depth buffer, but time is up and I need to get this posted and get back
working on the beta. 🙂</p>
