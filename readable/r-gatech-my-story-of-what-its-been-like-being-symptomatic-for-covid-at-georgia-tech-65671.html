<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-click-id="text"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>I moved in to campus on Sunday, I was coming from pretty far away, up by Chicago and so the two days before I had driven about 10 hours. I got to campus, started getting to get to know my roommate and had a good first day together.</p><p>Starting around 2:30 on Monday, I started to get a headache and felt just a little feverish. I used the crappy liquid crystal thermometer they gave us and it was reading a mild fever. At this point, my main prerogative was not getting others, especially my roommate, sick. So, I went outside to my car and tried to schedule an appointment at Stamps… I was outside from this point until 10 PM except a couple of minutes inside to fill up my water.</p><p>It was really quite difficult to schedule an appointment at Stamps, I couldn’t find the location online, and it took me a while to call and reach them. At the point I called them, it was 3:14 PM. The nurse I talked to said that after 3PM they don’t schedule anything for the same day. If you start getting potential covid-like symptoms, CALL BEFORE THREE PM!</p><p>Around 3:50 I notified my RA of my symptoms and what was going on and asked for accommodations to sleep somewhere else so that I didn’t have to get my roommates sick. My RA through this point was really nice, responsive and generally helpful. My hall director through my RA eventually got back to me and told me that if I wanted to be tested today, I could go to an urgent care center…</p><p>So I called up my sister and we both called all the urgent care centers on the list on Stamps’ website. The problem was, none of those urgent care centers had a rapid test.</p><p>At this point, my RA became less responsive and I couldn’t get a definitive answer as to whether or not I could get modified sleeping arrangements for the night. So I called the RA on call and explained the situation who then called the Hall Director on call. I finally got a definitive answer. Housing said they wouldn’t do anything until I got a positive test.</p><p>The only options I had at this point was 1) go to the ER to get a test 2) sleep in my car and get tested in the morning or 3) sleep in my dorm and get tested in the morning. I wasn’t really a fan of any of those options. I didn’t want to go to the ER, because if the ER declares it a non-emergency I’d be stuck with a massive bill, my parents didn’t want me to sleep in the car for understandable reasons, and I didn’t want to sleep in my room for obvious reasons.</p><p>Sadly I didn’t really have much of a choice, and I ended up sleeping in my room with my mask on. As you can imagine, sleeping with a mask on wasn’t that fun, but was the right decision.</p><p>Tuesday morning came around. I was still running a fever but my headache was gone and I was overall feeling better. I went to stamps around 10:30 and got the symptomatic test. The doctor who performed it was nice and told me they’d call me within an hour or two with the results.</p><p>I went back to my dorm (my roommate was out exploring campus) and ate some leftovers that I had. The doctor called me back pretty quick and said that I tested negative. After we talked about my symptoms, which at that point was really just a fever, a headache and very very mild achiness in my neck, she was still very concerned because the test, especially early on, has a high false negative rate, that I had been running a fever for almost 24 hours at that point, and that my symptoms although mild were consistent with covid. Because of these reasons, she wanted me to get moved to the isolation location. She called up housing and talked with them, and then she called me back. By 2:15 I had packed my bags and I was on my way to the isolation location.</p><p>The isolation location is a hotel just east of campus and it’s very nice, food gets delivered twice a day and it’s not bad food so far.</p><p>Now is Day three I guess of symptoms, I’m still running the fever and now I’m getting more symptoms consistent with covid such as achiness everywhere as though I had a massive workout yesterday. I haven’t been actually diagnosed yet, but I’m guessing based on these new symptoms I’m having that I’ll be clinically diagnosed tomorrow when the doc calls back and we talk.</p><p>That’s pretty much where I am right now below are some of my takeaways and feel free to ask questions if you’d like.</p><ol><li><p>If you feel any symptoms what so-ever consistent with covid go online to stamps and try to schedule an appointment and if you have any trouble CALL BEFORE 2:30 PM! Once you get an appointment to talk with a doc everything is smooth (they stop scheduling appointments if you call after 3PM)</p></li><li><p>Very mild or single symptoms can be covid! I started out with just a mild fever and headache which doesn’t scream covid to me, but the symptoms now do</p></li><li><p>If you have ANY symptoms, try to get away from everyone ASAP to stop the spread, this could be telling your roommate and getting them to stay out, or you staying out if you feel okay staying outside at that time.</p></li><li><p>Dealing with Housing was the worst part of this situation for me, if your hall director is in, call them, if they aren’t, call RA on call to contact the hall director on call.</p></li><li><p>People are going to get sick, and it’s up to each of us to recognize symptoms early on and act on those symptoms. When I talked to my parents the first day, they were 100% confident that I couldn’t possibly have covid. If you have ANY symptoms, act on it, don’t dismiss it!</p></li><li><p>WEAR A MASK</p></li><li><p>Get your surveillance test done as often as possible</p></li><li><p>Take your temperature at least once a day</p></li><li><p>EAT IN YOUR DORM ROOM OR OUTSIDE WITH YOUR ROOMMATE, just because you are eating doesn’t mean covid can’t spread. Not being able to eat with new people sucks, but that’s life. The only person you should be unmasked by is your roommate, including when you eat.</p></li></ol><p>This is up to us. Tech could be doing more, and honestly should be doing more. But if we want this school year to happen, we have to do everything we can to stop the spread as quickly as possible.</p></div></div></div></div>
