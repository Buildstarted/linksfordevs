	    <p>I and my wife finally managed to visit the USA like we wanted to do for quite a while now. This post is a mix of impressions, tips and photos from the trip. When I go on holiday, I rather enjoy my time than trying to take good photos of the place. I believe that is quite hard to take landscape photographs already and even harder to take them with time constraints at places never seen before. So let’s just enjoy the holiday and take few photos for our “trip down memory lane” photo book. It was also a good … <a href="http://sebasphotography.com/trip-to-the-usa-los-angeles/">Continue reading <span>Trip to the USA – Los Angeles</span></a></p>
