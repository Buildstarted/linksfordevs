		<p data-adtags-visited="true">So… I’ve got good news and bad news.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">The good news is:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve described an interface for discrete probability distributions and implemented several distributions.</li>
<li>I’ve shown how projecting a distribution is logically equivalent to the LINQ <code>Select</code> operator.</li>
<li>I’ve shown how conditional probabilities of the form <strong>P(B|A)</strong> “probability of B given A” are likelihood functions.</li>
<li>I’ve shown that combining a prior with a likelihood to form a joint distribution is the application of the monadic bind operator on the probability monad, and implemented this as <code>SelectMany</code>.</li>
<li>I’ve shown that computing the posterior distribution from the joint distribution can be done by applying a <code>Where</code> clause.</li>
<li>I’ve sketched out a statement-based workflow DSL that can be compiled down to our LINQ operators, and that lowering and then executing programs written in this DSL can compute a “sampling-loop-free” distribution automatically.</li>
<li>And that distribution object can then be efficiently sampled.</li>
</ul>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>This is all great</strong>, if I do say so myself. But the bad news is that there are some problems; let’s list them in order roughly from smallest to largest:</p>
<hr>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>First problem:</strong> It’s often inconvenient to express weights as integers, particularly when you end up with largish coprime weights; we’re risking integer overflow when we multiply or add them, and we lack facilities for common operations like “make me a Bernoulli distribution based on this arbitrary double”.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">That criticism is very valid, but the problem is totally fixable. I chose integer weights because it is easy to get integer arithmetic right in simple cases and we do not require any additional library support. A realistic implementation of a weighted discrete distribution would probably choose arbitrary-precision integers, arbitrary-precision rationals or doubles depending on its needs.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Using doubles slightly complicates the math because you either have to make sure that probabilities add up to 1.0 even when double representation error bites you, or you have to deal with situations where the total weight is not 1.0. The latter problem is not so bad; we can always divide through by the total weight if we need to. We’ll return to the more general problem of dealing with double-weighted distributions that do not add up to 1.0 later in this series.</p>
<hr>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Aside:</strong> Since probabilities are always between 0 and 1, and often very small, a common choice is to take the log of the probability as the weight. In that scheme we can implement multiplying two probabilities together as adding, which is nice, but lots of other operations get harder. This is also a nice representation if you’re doing math that involves computations of entropy, as entropy is defined as the negative log of the mass function. We won’t go there in this series.</p>
<hr>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Second problem:</strong> The basic idea of both our LINQ-based and statement-based implementations is to take a workflow that might contain conditions — <code>where</code> clauses, in the query form, <code>condition</code> statements in the statement form — and <em>infer</em> a distribution object that can be sampled from efficiently.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">But our technique for that is for <code>SelectMany</code> to produce <em>every possible outcome</em>, and then <em>group</em> them to determine the weights! For example, suppose we had a workflow like</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><span><span>var</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d10</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>SDU</span><span>.</span><span>Distribution</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>10</span><span>);</span><br>
<span>var</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>sum</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>from</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>a</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>in</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d10</span><br>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>from</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>b</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>in</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d10</span><br>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>from</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>c</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>in</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d10</span><br>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>from</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>in</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d10</span><br>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>let</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>a</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>+</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>b</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>+</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>c</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>+</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><br>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>where</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&gt;=</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>20</span><br>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>select</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>s</span><span>;</span></span></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">If these were sequences instead of distributions, we’d know what happens here: we enumerate all ten thousand possible combinations, run a filter over their sum, and then yield a whole sequence of sums that match the filter.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">But that’s almost exactly what we’re doing with the distributions too! Our query here is basically a syntactic sugar for</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><span><span>var</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>d10</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>=</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>SDU</span><span>.</span><span>Distribution</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>10</span><span>);</span><br>

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>group</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>s …</span></span></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">and you know how this goes from our implementation of&nbsp;<code>SelectMany</code>on distributions: we weight each member, group them by outcome, sum up the weights, and so on. The math at the end isn’t the expensive part; the number of nested loops we go through to get to that math is!</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Now imagine if this were a much more complex workflow, whether written in our query form or our statement form. <strong>Inferring the result of the workflow basically means evaluating every possible value for every local/range variable and recording the result.&nbsp;</strong>If there are lots of possible values for lots of variables, we could end up exploring millions or billions of possibilities, some of which are very low probability.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Now, the benefit here is of course that we only do that exploration <em>once</em>, and the probability distribution that comes out the other end is then cheap to use <em>forever;</em> we can memoize it, because by assumption everything is pure. But still, it seems odd that we’re implementing inference by running <em>every possible path through the workflow</em> and recording the results; it seems like we could trade off a small amount of inaccuracy for a great improvement in speed.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Put another way: in our original naive implementations of <code>Where</code> and <code>SelectMany</code> we didn’t do any inference; we just sampled the underlying distributions and lived with the fact that <code>Where</code> could loop a lot. Compare constructing the naive implementation to constructing our current implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constructing the <em>naive</em> version of the distribution is O(n) <em>in the size of the number of query operators</em>. In this case, we’ve got a tiny handful of <code>SelectMany</code>s and a <code>Where</code>. The number of query operators is usually very small.</li>
<li>Constructing the <em>exact</em> distribution is O(n) <em>in the number of possible combinations of all variables</em>, in this case, ten thousand. Those ten thousand computations then produce a correct weighted integer distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">And compare sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sampling the naive version would ultimately do four samples from d10, add them up, and reject the resulting sum a little bit less than half of the time. On average we would do around seven or eight samples of underlying distributions per one sample of the sum distribution.</li>
<li>Sampling the exact version is just sampling from a weighted integer, which we know&nbsp;does exactly two samples from its implementation distributions.</li>
</ul>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">And compare knowledge of the weights:</p>
<ul>
<li>The naive version can compute weights cheaply for <code>Where</code> conditioned distributions, but not distributions that have <code>SelectMany</code> clauses; it’s computing the weights that is expensive.</li>
<li>The exact version computes all weights exactly for all workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Which way is the win? Consider these scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’re never going to call <code>Sample()</code>, but we want an <em>accurate inference</em> of the true weights of outcomes given a workflow. When we’re computing the posterior distribution of “is this email a spam?” we don’t care to ever <em>sample</em> from that distribution; we want to know is it 99% or 1%?</li>
<li>We’re going to sample millions or billions of times, so keeping the per-sample cost as low as possible is important.</li>
<li>We are sampling and a <code>Where</code> clause rejects the vast majority of possible outcomes, causing long waits for a sample in the naive case.</li>
</ul>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">In those three scenarios, our current “exact but expensive inference” step is clearly better. But if those conditions are not met, then the current version is doing a lot of up-front work in order to save possibly very little work later.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Summing up:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not immediately obvious where to draw the line that indicates whether the inference optimization’s high up-front cost is worth the benefit of cheap sampling later.</li>
<li>It seems plausible that we could trade off a small amount of inaccuracy in the inference for large speed improvements in inference.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Third problem:</strong> the biggest problem with this system is: <em>in practice it only works for discrete distributions with small supports!</em></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">I started this series by making a general-purpose distribution type for discrete or continuous distributions, waved my hands a bit about continuous distributions, and then abandoned them entirely. But they are important!</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Moreover, we can’t easily work with discrete distributions where <em>any</em> integer is a possible output, like the geometric distribution or the Poisson distribution. Sure, we can approximate them by restricting their ranges to something reasonable, but it would be nice to be able to just have an object that represents a Poisson distribution and not have to worry about the repercussions of the fact that technically, the support is any positive integer.</p>
<hr>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><strong>Summing up:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve spent the last 22 episodes of this series <em>solving</em> <em>the easiest possible problems in this space</em>. All the operations we care about on “categorical distributions” admit easy exact solutions to the inference problem.</li>
<li>If you take away one thing from this series, well, it should be that <code>System.Random</code> is way too simple for the needs of modern programmers dealing with stochastic systems. By making a couple simple interfaces and implementations, we can represent very rich probabilistic workflows, compose them, and do math automatically.</li>
<li>If you take away two things, the second thing should be that <strong>sampling from a given distribution efficiently is a really hard problem. </strong>By restricting the problem enormously, we can make good progress on it, but once we leave the realm of tiny discrete distributions, we will be in some pretty deep water.</li>
</ul>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">We’ve taken small discrete distributions as far as I’m going to go in this series. I’m going to take a short break to visit my family for Easter, and then we’ll pick up when I get back.&nbsp;<span>I’ll spend the remainder of this series sketching out some ways we can use the ideas we’ve developed so far to tackle harder problems in stochastic programming, but will not go into as much depth as we have so far.</span></p>
