</figure> </div> <p>Are you tired of nagging your kids?&#xA0; Sick of the clothes on the floor?&#xA0; Had enough of their behaviour, &#xA0;whining or fighting and not listening? &#xA0;</p>
<p>Well, I was too.&#xA0; So I developed a behavior and chore game-like system that has CHANGED OUR LIVES and other families&#x2019; lives for the better.&#xA0; I&apos;ve shared the system with neighbours, friends, co-workers and even strangers and every single family has praised it&apos;s benefits.&#xA0; Every. single. family.&#xA0;</p>
<p>It wasn&apos;t until I was unexpectedly let go from my 20+ year corporate job in retail that I realized just how much I believed in the system. &#xA0;I was home with the kids playing the game and realized I wanted to share this idea with the world and pursue it as a real business. &#xA0;Seeing how well it worked for us and those around me, I truly and honestly wanted to help more families. &#xA0;So I spent over a year&#xA0;and all of my severance building it into a mobile app! &#xA0;An app we believe will become the <em>future of parenting in a digital age</em>!&#xA0;</p> <div class="template asset">

</figure> </div> <p><strong>THE APP - </strong>&#xA0;allows you to HIRE your Kids for jobs around the house and FIRE them when they don&apos;t follow the family values &amp; household or behavioural expectations.</p>
<p>Imagine your Kids WANTING to help around the house, WANTING to behave better and actually signing up for chores on their own without you having to constantly nag at them or repeat yourself a million times!</p>
<p>Our game motivates the Kids to take initiative vs. parents assiging or telling their Kids what to do. &#xA0;We use Recognition, Reward &amp; Discipline, teaching the Kids how to respect your family values, how to be a team player, be responsible and be accountable. &#xA0;All while preparing them for the important skills they&apos;ll need when they get out in the real world.</p>
<p>The Kids love choosing from the HFK characters within the app and enjoy playing &#x201C;employee&#x201D;, earning their &#x201C;pay day allowance&#x201C; and competing for the coveted Employee Of The Month reward! &#xA0;And parents love seeing their Kids taking the initiative, learning to take responsibility, work together, having fun and feeling proud of their accomplishments.</p> <div class="template asset">

</a> <p><strong>WHY AM I ASKING FOR HELP?</strong> &#xA0;I&apos;ve spent all of my money building the app. &#xA0;It is almost ready to launch, but going forward, not only do I need help with marketing and to hire a team to help grow this business, but I will be expanding the app&apos;s functionality based on Beta Testing finds and to include more fun features like &quot;vacation days&quot;, &quot;sick days&quot; &quot;overtime&quot;, and reloadable &apos;pre-paid cash cards&quot;! &#xA0;The money raised here will go towards these areas and will allow you and other families to enjoy the coolest parenting, chore and behavior app on the market.</p>
<p><strong>WHY DO I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THIS?</strong> &#xA0;I&apos;ve seen how this changes a family dynamic and how it builds teamwork among family members, how it brings the family closer together, reduces family friction and how it prepares Kids for the real world - learning about financial literacy, recognition and how positive behaviors and hard work are rewarded. &#xA0;I&apos;ve never been more passionate about anything in my life. &#xA0;I&apos;m a first time entrepreneur and have fully embraced it, learning and growing everyday! &#xA0;I&apos;ve been working harder at this than I ever have in my 20+ years in my corporate career.</p> <div class="template asset">

</figure> </div> <p><strong>WITH THESE FUNDS, HOW WILL I MAKE MY GOALS HAPPEN? </strong>We&apos;ve had a lot of interest with the media as our name definitely intrigues people and captures attention! &#xA0;We plan to use the money to launch a marketing campaign and work with influencers, experts, educators and the media alike to expand across the Country promoting Hire and Fire your Kids. &#xA0;We have already had behavioural analysts, psycologists, behavioural consultants, social workers and Registered Early Childhood Educators who have recommended Hire and Fire your Kids. &#xA0;As well as numerous testimonials from our &quot;test families&quot; <a href="https://hireandfireyourkids.com/testimonials">https://hireandfireyourkids.com/testimonials</a> . &#xA0;The more eyes we can get on us the better! We need to share how this digital &quot;real world&quot; game played between parents and Kids can help reduce family friction and help prepare more Kids with the skills they&apos;ll need to function sucessfully when they get out on their own. &#xA0;I&apos;ve gained connections with key players in the media space and mommy influencers. &#xA0;Plan to execute a press release to generate some earned media though GTA publications, radio, magazines, podcasts, tradeshows etc. and continue to work it across Canada!</p>
<p><strong>WHO AM I?</strong> &#xA0;I am a Mom of` 5 in a blended family ages ranging from 4-22. &#xA0;I am extremely hard working and dedicated to success. &#xA0;I am beyond ready to take this App to the next level. &#xA0;Being a first time entrepreneur my life has done a complete 180 and I&apos;ve never been more passionate about anything in my life. &#xA0;I&apos;ve changed and grown so much as a person, facing my fears and putting myself out there. &#xA0;I can&apos;t wait to see Hire and Fire your Kids grow! &#xA0;Please know that your investment is in good hands. &#xA0;The high performance during my retail career and my strong work ethic will ensure this app is a success. &#xA0;Please feel free to check out the LinkedIn recommendations from people who have worked with me to give you a better idea of who I am as leader and person. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jody-swain-94837321/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jody-swain-94837321/</a>&#xA0;</p>
