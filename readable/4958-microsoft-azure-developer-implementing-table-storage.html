My name is Filip Ekberg, and welcome to my course, Microsoft Azure Developer: Implementing Table Storage. I am a principal consultant and CEO at a consultant agency operating out of Gothenburg in Sweden. I started the company a few years ago and focused on building software for the masses powered by the cloud, as well as with mobility in mind. This course is for anyone that wants to leverage a highly flexible, reliable, and super-fast data back end for your service, which is why in this course we are going to look at everything that we need to get started with the Azure Table Storage. We will cover topics such as how to introduce Azure Table Storage in a. NET application, the differences between Azure Table Storage and the Azure Cosmos DB Table API, working with the Table Storage REST API, as well as why Azure Table Storage is the perfect fit for any type of application no matter if it's an application scaled across the globe or a small app operating out of a single region. By the end of this course, you'll feel familiar with the Azure Table Storage and when it's appropriate for your app to use the Cosmos DB Table API versus the traditional Azure Table Storage. Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with programming in C#. Other than that, you're good to go. Are you ready to take your application to a whole new level? Let your user base grow and your application scale worldwide without breaking a sweat. I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn all about Azure Table Storage with the Microsoft Azure Developer: Implementing Table Storage course as Pluralsight.</p></div></div></div></div>
