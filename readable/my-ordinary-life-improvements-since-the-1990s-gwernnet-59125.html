<blockquote>
<p><span>It can be hard to see the gradual improvement of most goods over time</span>, but I think one way to get a handle on them is to look at their <em>downstream</em> effects: all the small ordinary everyday things which nevertheless depend on obscure innovations and improving cost-performance ratios and gradually dropping costs and new material and… etc. All of these gradually drop the cost, drop the price, improve the quality at the same price, remove irritations or limits not explicitly noticed, or so on.</p>
<p>It all adds up.</p>
<p>So here is a personal list of small ways in which my ordinary everyday daily life has been getting better since the late ’80s/early ’90s (as far back as I can clearly remember these things—I am sure the list of someone growing up in the 1940s would include many hassles I’ve never known at all).</p>

<p><span>Progress is usually debated in terms of the big things</span> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_years_in_science#2000s" data-popup-title="List of years in science" data-popup-author="English Wikipedia" data-popup-abstract="<p>The following entries cover events related to science or technology which occurred in the listed year.</p>">science</a> &amp; tech: discovering gravitational waves, creating world champion AIs, and conquering hepatitis C or curing deadly cancers with genetically-engineered T-cells. But as cool as these things are, and even matters of life-and-death for many, such achievements tend to be remote from ordinary people, and not your everyday sort of thing (or so one hopes). What about the <em>little</em> things?</p>
<p>When I think back, so many hassles have simply disappeared. I remember my desk used to be crowded with things like dictionaries and pencil sharpeners, but between smartphones &amp; computers, most of my desk space is now dedicated to cats. Ordinary life had a lot of hassles too, I remembered once I started thinking about it. These things rarely come up because so many of them are about removing irritations or creating new possibilities—dogs that do not bark, and ‘the seen and the unseen’—and how quickly we forget that the status quo was not always so. Limiting myself to my earliest relatively clear memories of everyday life in the 1990s, I still wound up making a decent-sized list of improvements to my ordinary life.</p>
<p>(Now, imagine if I could have extended this back another decade. Then another decade.

The plush toys on store shelves these days are cheaper, often safer, and much, much softer than in bygone days. They represent a small example of a pervasive phenomenon: goods whose quality has improved gradually but significantly over time, without corresponding price increases and or public recognition.</p><p>If you shop around, you can find a stuffed Easter bunny for three dollars, as you could in the 1970s. My neighborhood Target is selling two models at that price, the cheapest in a lineup of plush Easter toys that includes offerings for $4.99, $9.99 and $19.99 (for a giant rabbit). Back in 1970, when I myself was young enough for Easter baskets, Walgreens advertised “plush bunnies in ‘hot’ colors” for $2.97, along with others for $2.19 and $3.77. The $2.97 bunny from 1970 was probably bigger than today’s $2.99 model, but keep in mind that these prices are not corrected for inflation. The 1970 bunny would cost$17.97 in today’s dollars. Or, to use another benchmark, the federal minimum wage in 1970 was $1.45—about half the price of one of those Walgreens bunnies—compared with today’s minimum of $7.25, more than double the price of the Target ones. Earning enough to buy the 1970 bunny required 123 minutes of minimum-wage labor versus about 25 minutes today. Three-dollar bunnies are low-profit items designed to get people in the store and stimulate impulse buying. But the broad pattern applies to more expensive stuffed animals as well: Prices have stayed low. For that, you can thank intense international competition.</p><p>…Consumers have come to expect low prices. But inexpensive doesn’t necessarily mean “cheap.” The quality of stuffed toys has also improved. “It’s a better product than it was years ago, and it’s not that much more expensive,” said Steven Meyer, the third-generation owner of Mary Meyer Corp., a Vermont-based toy company. Meyer joined the company in 1986, helping his father weather the tough transition to manufacturing in Korea.</p><p>For example, Meyer explained, Korean and Taiwanese toymakers introduced safety procedures, later copied in China, to assure the toys didn’t contain hidden hazards. “Every one of our toys is put through a metal detector before it goes into a box, and that’s because a little shard of a sewing needle can break off and go into the toy,” Meyer said. “We never thought of that when we produced in the United States.”</p><p>More immediately apparent is how the toys feel. A stuffed animal that would have delighted a baby boomer now seems rigid and rough. Today’s toys are stuffed with soft, fibrous polyester rather than the foam rubber, sawdust or ground nut shells of the past. Plush outer fabrics no longer have stiff backings; the yarns are knitted to one another rather than attached to a rigid fabric like a carpet. “The whole stuffed toy feels softer and slouchier,” Meyer said. The real magic, however, is in that silky faux fur. I first noticed it about a dozen years ago while buying Christmas presents for my nephew, who has super-sensitive skin and hates clothing tags and scratchy fabrics. Stuffed animals, I discovered, were as different from my childhood toys as a wickable polyester workout T-shirt is from a sweat-sticky polyester disco suit. The secret to both wickable T-shirts and softer Easter bunnies lies in polyester microfibers. These high-tech textiles have replaced the acrylic and polyester plushes that once covered stuffed toys just as they’ve nudged aside cotton for exercise apparel.</p><p>…Textile fibers, including polyester filaments, are measured in decitex or deniers, almost equivalent units unique to the business. For reference: Silk measures about 1.1 to 1.3 decitex, while human hair is 30 to 50. A microfiber is anything less than 1 decitex. Although polyester microfibers date to Toray Industries’ development of Ultrasuede in 1970, they have become widespread only in recent years, thanks in part to massive plant investments in China that have swamped the polyester market and driven down prices. Back when I was buying toys for my nephew, polyester fibers of around 3 decitex “were considered fine,” said Frank Horn, president of the Fiber Economics Bureau, the statistical collection and publication arm of the American Fiber Manufacturers Association. But over the past decade or so, true microfibers have “become ubiquitous.” Now, Horn estimated, the average is about 0.5 decitex—a reduction of about 85%—and some popular microfibers are as fine as 0.3 decitex. The finer the fiber, the softer the final fabric—making today’s stuffed animals extraordinarily silky. Largely unheralded outside the textile business, this progress was “not one particular technology but many,” explained textile chemist Phil Brown of Clemson University’s materials science and engineering school. “Some involved changing fiber shape, some involved using chemical treatments to reduce fiber size, some involved new fiber extrusion technologies in which fibers have more than one polymer component.”</p>" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="http://www.times-news.com/cnhi_network/how-those-plush-easter-bunnies-got-so-cuddly/article_8e6a93c7-fbe4-5735-9d94-9426f0b3d164.html">much more cuddly and silky</a></p></li>

It first appears in the <i>Ghostbusters</i> (1984) film as a picture logo on a prop package of marshmallows in Dana Barrett's apartment, on a graffiti advertisement on the building next to the Ghostbusters' HQ, and then in the climax of the film as the physical manifestation of the Sumerian deity Gozer. Subsequently, it has been incorporated into many other Ghostbusters media, including the animated series <i>The Real Ghostbusters</i>, comic books, a stage show, and video games.</p>">Stay Puft Marshmallow Man</a> or freezing (and if you get wet, freezing anyway) or exotic ultra-expensive garments aimed at mountain climbers, you can now buy ordinary (and much cheaper) winter coats which are amazingly thin and work even better to keep you warm—so much so that you have to be careful to not buy <em>too</em> well-insulated a coat, lest you swelter at the slightest exertion and be placed between the Scylla of overheating &amp; the Charybdis of opening your coat to the freezing air to cool.</li>

The name Honeycrisp was trademarked by the University of Minnesota, but university officials were unsure of its protection status in 2007. It is now the official state fruit of Minnesota.</p>">Honeycrisp</a> apples (beginning 1991) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SweeTango" data-popup-title="SweeTango" data-popup-author="English Wikipedia" data-popup-abstract="<p><b>SweeTango</b> or '<b>Minneiska'</b> is a cultivar of apple developed by the University of Minnesota in 2000 and first sold in the US in 2009.

But even the classic tasting sprouts are not as bitter as they were.’</p><p>Syngenta claims to be the leading company for creating new Brussels sprouts varieties, with a market share of roughly 80%. The company currently produces 24 commercial varieties – needed to ensure year-round availability, Van der Toorn says. ‘From 2012 onwards, Syngenta will have a complete assortment of super mild tasting hybrids available to guarantee product supply to consumers during the whole growing season.’ And the company is also now evaluating new red-coloured sprouts varieties, such as those on offer this Christmas at UK supermarket giant Asda. These red Brussels are currently being grown by Cambridgeshire farmer John Lankfer, who is reportedly supplying selected stores with 100 t of the brassica over the festive season. As well as their aesthetic appeal, the red sprouts are also claimed to have a milder, sweeter flavour, which it is hoped will make them more attractive to children.</p><p>…Syngenta began a breeding programme to develop milder tasting Brussels varieties in the early 1990s. While many older people prefer the classical bitter tastes, Van der Toorn notes that younger people tend to prefer the milder tasting varieties that have now become the industry standard.</p><p>The bitter taste of Brussels sprouts comes from compounds called glucosinolates and their degradation products, he explains. These bitter tasting compounds are an important part of the plant’s defence mechanism against leaf-eating enemies, such as insects, nematodes, slugs, and herbivores, like pigeons and deer. They are also responsible for many of the health-giving properties of Brussels and other brassicas, particularly their antioxidant and anti-cancer properties…Syngenta scientists first discovered the relationship between glucosinolates and bitter taste in the early 1990s, Van der Toorn says: ‘The lower the level of some glucosinolates the less bitter the taste of the Brussels, which is perceived as milder or sweeter.’ Fortunately, ‘the ones that are causing the bitter taste in Brussels sprouts are not the ones that have health benefits,’ he adds. The first of its sweeter tasting varieties, called <em>Maximus</em>, was introduced onto the marketplace in 1994, while another popular variety this Christmas is <em>Helemus</em>.</p>" rel="archived alternate nofollow" data-url-original="https://www.soci.org/Chemistry-and-Industry/CnI-Data/2010/24/Brussels-a-bittersweet-story">no longer taste</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/10/30/773457637/from-culinary-dud-to-stud-how-dutch-plant-breeders-built-our-brussels-sprouts-bo" data-popup-title="From Culinary Dud To Stud: How Dutch Plant Breeders Built Our Brussels Sprouts Boom" data-popup-author="Dan Charles (NPR)" data-popup-date="2019-10-30" data-popup-abstract="<p>Foods go in and out of style. Few of them, though, have gone through as dramatic a renaissance in their reputation as Brussels sprouts. For many years, they were scorned. Even Steve Bontadelli admits it, and he makes his living growing them. “A lot of people of my generation hated them,” he says. “Their moms boiled them and made them even stinkier.” Bontadelli’s farm is near Santa Cruz, Calif., where the weather is perfect for growing this vegetable. “We actually had a Brussels sprouts festival here for about 10 years,” he says. “And we got a lot of free press out of the deal, because people couldn’t believe that you’d have a festival for Brussels sprouts.” What’s worse, they even deserved their bad reputation. “They were just very bitter; a very strong bitter taste,” Bontadelli says.</p><p>This all started to change in the 1990s, and it began in the Netherlands, where Brussels sprouts have a simpler name: <em>spruitjes</em>. A Dutch scientist named Hans van Doorn, who worked at the seed and chemical company Novartis (the seed part is now called Syngenta), figured out exactly which chemical compounds in <em>spruitjes</em> made them bitter. At that point, the small handful of companies that sell Brussels sprouts seeds started searching their archives, looking for old varieties that happen to have low levels of the bitter chemicals.</p><p>…There are hundreds of these old varieties. The companies grew them in test plots, and they did, in fact, find some that weren’t as bitter. They cross-pollinated these old varieties with modern, high-yielding ones, trying to combine the best traits of old and new <em>spruitjes</em>. It took many years. But it worked. “From then on, the taste was much better. It really improved,” Sintenie says.</p><p>Then word spread in the professional culinary scene. It took off mainly in the United States, not in Europe. Shannan Troncoso remembers hearing, about a decade ago, that celebrity chef David Chang was doing amazing things with Brussels sprouts and bacon at his restaurant Momofuku, in New York. Then she encountered some crispy fried Brussels sprouts at a restaurant in San Francisco. “It was so good, I was like, I can figure this out! And I can introduce this back into my area,” she says….Demand is booming; farmers are getting four or five times more money than they did a decade ago for their crop. “My dad, his jaw would just drop,” Bontadelli says. “He’d ask me every day, ‘What’s the price, what’s the price?’ Because he’d been in the business his whole life. His eyes would just pop out when I’d tell him. He couldn’t believe it.” Bontadelli says that there were only about 2,500 acres in the whole country planted with Brussels sprouts just a few years ago. Today, there are 10,000 acres of Brussels sprouts in the U.S., and fields are getting planted in Mexico, too—just so people can get their Brussels sprouts year-round.</p>">quite so bad</a></p></li>

Somewhere around then, mothers stopped teaching their daughters how to sew or make clothes—I think less because of any feminism and more because it no longer seems like a particularly worthwhile skill to learn, especially given pressure from other uses of time like sports or homework. My grandmother in the 1950s routinely made whole outfits—dresses and pants and socks—for her family, while my mother only sewed under considerable duress, and my sisters couldn’t use a sewing machine at all (until one of them took up jewelry as a hobby as an adult). When I’ve asked about other families, this has been a common pattern.<a href="#fnref5" role="doc-backlink">↩︎︎</a></p></li>
