Even the terrible ones qualify! Currently the database contains <b><span id="titlenumber" class="updatable">1350</span> puzzlescript games</b>, and is complete up to <b>December 31st 2019</b>.</p><p>Whenever a new puzzlescript game is made, it will be added to this list by the community. <b>Found a missing title? Please add it now!</b></p><h2>Adding a puzzlescript game to this list</h2><p>To add a game to the "<b>Puzzlescript games database</b>" list in one click, simply use this handy <a href="javascript:
var jsCode=document.createElement('script');
jsCode.setAttribute('src','https://pedropsi.github.io/codes/game/puzzlescript-tagger.js');
jsCode.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');
document.body.appendChild(jsCode);
console.log('Bookmarklet run!');void 0">Submit PuzzleScript Game</a> bookmarklet!</p><p>How? Simply add the bookmarklet above to your bookmarks (instructions below), then on a game page of your choice run (<kbd>click</kbd> on) the new bookmarklet, causing the current game to add itself the <b>Puzzlescript games database</b> page.</p><h3>In Chrome</h3><p><kbd>Drag</kbd> the above bookmarklet link to your bookmarks toolbar.</p><h3>In Firefox</h3><p><kbd>Right click</kbd> on the above bookmarklet link, then select "bookmark this link".</p><h3>If nothing else works</h3><p>Replace the content of an old bookmark with the above link content. Or you could run the bookmarklet js code directly in a game page (it'd still be quicker than manual alternatives).</p><h3>Manual submission</h3><p>You can also submit a game to the <b>Puzzlescript games database</b> by typing all details manually. This is only recommended when more practical than using the bookmarklet.</p><p class="button" onclick="RequestPGDSubmission()">Submit a game to the <b>Puzzlescript games database</b>!</p><p>As your edits will be immediately available on database refresh, please be type carefully - even though all game entries can be corrected or completed later, by any user.</p><h3>Where to find new games to add</h3><p>If you want to add a game to the <b>Puzzlescript games database</b> but don't know where to look, you're in luck - for 99% of all new puzzlescript games show up at one of these four channels:</p><p>This is what makes the <b>Puzzlescript games database</b> so convenient - a single page where new games are gathered, so you won't need to search yourself. Any new game contributions are thus very welcome!</p><h2>Adding to or correcting game entries</h2><p>To correct a game entry in the <b>Puzzlescript games database</b>, simply <kbd>right click</kbd> on it! This will display small form.</p><h2>Conventions</h2><h3>What is the ◊ symbol?</h3><p>When available, links are opened in the <a href="game-console.html">Game Console</a>, which loads the Pedro PSI's <a href="game-bar.html">game bar</a> by default. This is indicated by the ◊ symbol. Clicking this symbol directly will, however, direct you to the original <a href="https://puzzlescript.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Puzzlescript</a> game page!</p><p><b>NB:</b> To add a <em>level selector</em> and <em>fullscreen</em> option  on the fly to other games, just use the Pedro PSI's <a href="game-bar.html#Bookmarklet">Game bar Bookmarklet</a>!</p><h3>Filtering</h3><p>Filter the <b>Puzzlescript games database</b> by keywords such as <b>name</b>, <b>author</b> and <b>date added</b>. Just type a keyword in the search field atop the table. Keywords are not space- nor case-sensitive.</p><p>To save and link to a specific filtered view of the table, ensure this page's URL ends with <code>?search=<b>keywords</b></code>. For example: <a href="https://pedropsi.github.io/puzzlescript-games-database.html?search=<span class=&quot;update-year&quot;">2020'&gt;https://pedropsi.github.io/puzzlescript-games-database.html?search=<span class="update-year">2020</span></a></p><p>All saved filtered views update whenever the <b>Puzzlescript games database</b> updates.</p><h3>Sorting</h3><h4>Dates</h4><p>By default, all game entries are sorted by date tier: most recently added games are atop, sorted by date of submission (e.g. today, this week, this fortnight, previous month etc...) - usually these are newly released games, but occasionally elusive old titles; all other games are grouped by year of first release.</p><p>Games with yet unknown date of release have a 'unknown' tier but will self-correct (based on the creation date of the most recent gist) as soon as someone plays them in the console. Dates can also be manually added.</p><h4>Author and Title</h4><p>Within each date tier, all game entries are sorted alphabetically by author and then by title.</p><h4>Custom</h4><p>To sort the table differently, simply <kbd>click</kbd> the table headers!</p><h3>Game <sup class="label">labels</sup></h3><p>A game title may be unfinished or in progress <sup class="label">beta</sup>, an extended or modified version of another game <sup class="label">mod</sup>, a port of another game to puzzlescript <sup class="label">demake</sup> and may have appended a version number  <sup class="label">v0.0.0</sup> and other notes <sup class="label">etc...</sup></p><p>For demakes or mods, or when a tribute to a known former author was meant, new authors may be labelled <sup class="label">Former Author</sup>.</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><h3>Real-time submission vs display delays</h3><p>Game entries are submitted in real time, and become immediately available on page (re)load.</p><p>Please be aware that on page load, a cached version of the table is displayed first, because it may take a few seconds to fetch the up-to-date table in real time. Once fetched, there is a small alert and the tag <em>Up-to-date</em> will be added to the table title.</p><h3>Game/Author formatting issues, missing or outdated</h3><p>The bookmarklet will copy the information present in the original puzzlescript game file, and may discard some characters such as parentheses and punctuation marks. So if a game entry is incorrect or incomplete, please correct it now!</p><p>Please note that the database doesn't track changes in game author/title after the submission. So please correct any outdated information as well!</p><h3>Missing links</h3><p>If a newly submitted game belongs to a known domain (e.g. puzzlescript.net), its link becomes immediately available. Otherwise, for security, it will be listed without a link (so people can google it themselves), until a periodic review. During this (infrequent) review, legitimate new domains will be added to the whitelist and their links enabled, whereas any suspicious submission will be removed.</p><h3>Missing submitted game entries</h3><h4>Hidden from view</h4><p>If, after re-submitting the game and fetching the most recent version of the database, a game is still not shown, most likely it was manually hidden from view. This is extremely rare and only happens if the game:</p><ul><li>is unplayable, despite loading correctly; or</li><li>has a more recent version (not mod) in the database.</li></ul><p>If you believe a game currently shown strictly meets the above criteria to be hidden from view, please <a href="contact.html">contact Pedro PSI</a>.</p><h4>Game prototypes and demonstrations of particular mechanics</h4><p>All game prototypes not listed in the <b>Puzzlescript games database</b> are filed instead under <a href="game-tools.html">Game Tools</a> in a second database, alongside other useful examples of a particular mechanics of game components.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Why would you want to contribute to this database for free?</h3><p>If you love (puzzlescript) games you'll love to have a definite public list with all titles.</p><h3>How could such a huge list of puzzlescript games be compiled with moderate effort?</h3><p>The bookmarklet is that quick and convenient - no typing involved. Have a try!</p><h3>Is there any shorter, curated list with just the great titles?</h3><p>You may be looking for Pedro PSI's curated list of <a href="2019-01-31-selected-puzzlescript-games.html">selected games</a>!</p><h3>How could this long list of puzzlescript games become more useful?</h3><p>Depending on traction, this collaborative list may gain a wiki-like character, so people could add detailed info like release year and tags, thus enabling better filtering. If pictures were added, this could become a puzzlescript gallery. Perhaps people would like to vote on their favourites!</p><h3>Can this database be used in external projects?</h3><p>For non-profit or educational projects, yes, as long as you cite it properly.</p><p>For all other projects, please <a href="contact.html">contact Pedro PSI</a> to discuss.</p><h3>How to cite this database properly?</h3><p>Just include all information below, using your favourite citing convention.
