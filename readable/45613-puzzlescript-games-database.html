    <h1>Puzzlescript games database</h1>
    <div class="text prose post" id="post">
<p>This aims to be the definitive list of all (public) puzzlescript games, ever made, worldwide. Even the terrible ones qualify! Currently the database contains <b><span id="titlenumber" class="updatable">1350</span> puzzlescript games</b>, and is complete as of <b>December 2019</b>.</p>
<p>Whenever a new puzzlescript game is made, it will be added to this list by the community. <b>Found a missing title? Please add it now!</b></p> <h2>Adding a puzzlescript game to this list</h2>
<p>To add a game to the &quot;<b>Puzzlescript games database</b>&quot; list in one click, simply use this handy <a href="javascript:
var jsCode=document.createElement(&apos;script&apos;);
jsCode.setAttribute(&apos;src&apos;,&apos;https://pedropsi.github.io/codes/game/puzzlescript-tagger.js&apos;);
jsCode.setAttribute(&apos;type&apos;,&apos;text/javascript&apos;);
document.body.appendChild(jsCode);
console.log(&apos;Bookmarklet run!&apos;);void 0">Submit PuzzleScript Game</a> bookmarklet!</p> <p> How? Simply add the bookmarklet above to your bookmarks (instructions below), then on a game page of your choice run (<kbd>click</kbd> on) the new bookmarklet, causing the current game to add itself the <b>Puzzlescript games database</b> page.</p> <h3>In Chrome</h3><p><kbd>Drag</kbd> the above bookmarklet link to your bookmarks toolbar.</p><h3>In Firefox</h3><p><kbd>Right click</kbd> on the above bookmarklet link, then select &quot;bookmark this link&quot;.</p><h3>If nothing else works</h3><p>Replace the content of an old bookmark with the above link content. Or you could run the bookmarklet js code directly in a game page (it&apos;d still be quicker than manual alternatives).</p> <h2>Conventions</h2>
<h3>What is the &#x25CA; symbol?</h3><p>When available, links are opened in the <a href="game-console.html">Game Console</a>, which loads the Pedro PSI&apos;s <a href="game-bar.html">game bar</a> by default. This is indicated by the &#x25CA; symbol. Clicking this symbol directly will, however, direct you to the original <a href="https://puzzlescript.net">Puzzlescript</a> game page!</p><p><b>NB:</b> To add a <em>level selector</em> and <em>fullscreen</em> option on the fly to other games, just use the Pedro PSI&apos;s <a href="game-bar.html#Bookmarklet">Game bar Bookmarklet</a>!</p> <h3><b>Bold</b> game entries</h3>
<p><b>Bold</b> game entries are new submissions, added in the past week. Often, these will be newly released games, but they may also include elusive old titles.</p> <h3>Sorting</h3>
<p>By default, all game entries are sorted by date of submission tier, most recent atop. The tier &quot;pre-completion&quot; includes all games submitted to the database before December 15th 2019, when it was deemed &quot;complete&quot;.</p>
<p>Within each date tier, all game entries are sorted alphabetically by author and then by title. To sort the table differently, simply <kbd>click</kbd> the table headers!</p> <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Real-time submission vs display delays</h3>
<p>Game entries are submitted in real time, and become immediately available on page (re)load.</p>
<p>Please be aware that on page load, a cached version of the table is displayed first, because it may take a few seconds to fetch the up-to-date table in real time. Once fetched, there is a small alert and the tag <em>Up-to-date</em> will be added to the table title.</p> <h3>Game/Author formatting issues, missing or outdated</h3>
<p>The bookmarklet will copy the information present in the original puzzlescript game file, and may discard some characters such as parentheses and punctuation marks. So if a game entry is incorrect or incomplete, please <a href="contact.html">contact Pedro PSI</a> for a manual correction.</p>
<p>Please note that the database doesn&apos;t track changes in game author/title after the submission. Please <a href="contact.html">let Pedro PSI know</a> of any outdated information!</p> <h3>Missing links</h3>
<p>If a newly submitted game belongs to a known domain (e.g. puzzlescript.net), its link becomes immediately available. Otherwise, for security, it will be listed without a link (so people can google it themselves), until a periodic review. During this (infrequent) review, legitimate new domains will be added to the whitelist and their links enabled, whereas any suspicious submission will be removed.</p> <h3>Missing submitted game entries</h3>
<p>If, after re-submitting the game and fetching the most recent version of the database, a game is still not shown, most likely it was manually hidden from view. This is extremely rare and only happens if the game:</p>
<ul> <li>is unplayable, despite loading correctly; or</li> <li>was never meant as a game or game prototype, but built for instance to demonstrate a particular mechanic or puzzlescript quirk; or</li> <li>has a more recent version (not mod) in the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe a game currently shown strictly meets the above criteria to be hidden from view, please <a href="contact.html">contact Pedro PSI</a>.</p> <h2>FAQ</h2>
