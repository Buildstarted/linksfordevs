     <p><span>The Staying Power of Kubernetes with Kelsey Hightower</span></p>

               <p>
               Join Corey and Kelsey as they explore the journey that led Kelsey to Kubernetes; where Corey feels Kubernetes falls short; how Kubernetes is just another step in the evolution of technology, with more to follow in the future; why Corey used to argue against the cloud; why Kelsey believes Kubernetes makes hyperspecialization worthwhile; Kelsey’s general feelings about multi-cloud; what Kelsey believes is the biggest thing that’s misunderstood about Kubernetes; what the future of Kubernetes looks like; and more.          </p>

     <p><span>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery Made Easy with Rob Zuber</span></p>

               <p>
               Rob Zuber is the CTO of CircleCI, makers of a full-service CI/CD platform. Before that, he co-founded Copious, a social marketplace built around people and their interests, and Yoohoot, a mobile advertising company that was acquired by Appconomy. He also served as VP and chief mobile strategist at Critical Path, CTO at AdPerk, VP of business development at Kobo, and an instructor at Marakana, among other positions.

Join Corey and Rob as they discuss the ins and outs of continuous integration and continuous delivery and touch upon why it’s hard to scale CI/CD, why many companies end up focusing on what’s called undifferentiated heavy lifting and why that’s a bad thing, what keeps AWS awake at night (hint: something to do with money), why at the end of the day, it’s all about the product, how developer relations is really a marketing endeavor, how CircleCI is a team of engineers solving problems for another team of engineers, why distributed teams are becoming the norm, and more.

     <p><span>The Wide World of AWS Consulting with Andreas Wittig</span></p>

               <p>
               Andreas Wittig is an author, entrepreneur, and AWS cloud architect and software engineer at widdix, a tech firm based in Germany. He’s also a senior consultant at tecRacer who focuses on AWS. Andreas recently co-wrote Amazon Web Services in Action with his brother, Michael, and together they run cloudonaut.io, an AWS-focused consultancy. Among other career highlights, Andreas once migrated the complete IT infrastructure of a leading German bank to AWS. 

Join Corey and Andreas as they discuss both of their journeys to AWS, how Andreas gets his ideas for AWS-inspired content, why Andreas thinks Fargate is a great tool for deploying applications on AWS—and why it’s even better than Lambda in some instances, the inspiration behind the Wittig brother’s new book, the two promises of Global Accelerator and when the tool is particularly valuable, additional AWS services Andreas believes don’t get enough attention, the concept of “infrastructure bootstrapping,” and more.          </p>
