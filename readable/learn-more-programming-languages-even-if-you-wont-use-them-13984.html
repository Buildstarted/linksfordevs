<p><em>This article has been translated into Spanish: <a href="https://www.campusmvp.es/recursos/post/por-que-debes-aprender-mas-lenguajes-de-programacion-incluso-si-no-los-vas-a-utilizar.aspx">Por quÃ© debes aprender mÃ¡s lenguajes de programaciÃ³n (incluso si no los vas a utilizar)</a></em></p>

<p>Imagine weâ€™ve been handed a task and weâ€™re free to choose the
programming language. The assignment involves all sorts of string
manipulation: reading strings, splitting strings, trimming, joining
and running regular expressions over strings, everything in UTF-8 and,
of course, emojis need to work. Which language do we choose? C? Oh,
please no.</p>

<p>Another job, this time at a financial institution. We need to do tens
of thousands of concurrent calculations. High performance is a hard
requirement. Should we useâ€¦ Ruby? Come on. Next up: a one-off script
that renames a bunch of filesâ€¦ written in Java? A web browserâ€¦ in
Python? Programming a controller for a medical device withâ€¦ C#?
Swift? Lua? You get the point.</p>

<p>Different programming languages are good at different things and bad
at others. Each one makes certain things easier and in turn others
harder. Depending on what we want to do we can save ourselves a lot of
work by choosing the language that makes solving the type of problem
weâ€™re facing the easiest.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s one of the tangible, no-nonsense benefits of learning more languages. You
put another tool in your toolbox and when the time comes youâ€™re able to choose
the best one. But I would go one step further.</p>

<p>I think itâ€™s valuable to learn new programming languages even if
â€”&nbsp;here it comes â€”&nbsp;you never take them out of the box.</p>

<p>Languages <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/lera_boroditsky_how_language_shapes_the_way_we_think">shape the way we think</a>*, each in their own
peculiar way. Thatâ€™s true for programming languages as well. Each
language contains a different mental model, a different perspective
for thinking about computation and how to write programs.</p>

<p>Take SQL, for example, and how it shapes your thoughts about the flow
and the form of data in your program.  Now consider what that would
look like in an imperative, object-oriented language like Java, or a
functional language like Haskell. Or in C. Imagine what a multi-player
game server looks like in Python, in Haskell, in Erlang; streaming and
processing terabytes of data in C, in Go, in Clojure; a user
interface in Tcl, in Lua, in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Every programming language is a lens through which we can look at the
problem weâ€™re trying to solve. Through some of them the problem
appears convoluted, exhausting. Through others it doesnâ€™t even look
like a problem at all, it looks barely different from any other
mundane thing one does in this language.</p>

<p>By learning a new language, even if it stays in your toolbox for all
eternity, you gain a new perspective and a different way of thinking
about problems. Once youâ€™ve implemented a game server in Erlang,
youâ€™re going to see game servers in a different light. After youâ€™ve
processed data in a Lisp by thinking of the data as a series of lists
that you can mold by sending it through a series of tiny functions
that can be composed to form pipelines of functions, youâ€™ll see
shadows of this pattern appear everywhere. As soon as youâ€™ve had your
first real taste of memory management in C, youâ€™ll start to appreciate
what Python, Ruby and Go are doing for you â€”&nbsp;while seeing the cost of
their labour. And if you ever built a UI in JavaScript with React.js,
you know that youâ€™re thinking about UI components shifted, in a
fundamental way.</p>

<p>These new perspectives, these ideas and patterns â€”&nbsp;they linger, they
stay with you, even if you end up in another language. And that is
powerful enough to keep on learning new languages, because one of the
best things that can happen to you when youâ€™re trying to solve a
problem is a change of perspective.</p>

<p><em>* This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">linguistic relativity</a> or the
Sapirâ€“Whorf hypothesis. In the context of this article I support the thesis in
certain ways, but you should know that in the scientific community itâ€™s validity
is still very much open for debate. See <a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/language-and-thought">this article</a> for
an introduction to the problems with the thesis.</em></p>
