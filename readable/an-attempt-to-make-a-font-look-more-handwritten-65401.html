<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’m actually not super happy with the results of this experiment, but I wanted
to share it anyway because it was very easy and fun to play with fonts. And
somebody asked me how to do it and I told her I’d write a blog post about it :)</p>
<h3 id="background-the-original-handwritten-font">background: the original handwritten font</h3>
<p>Some background: I have a font of my handwriting that I’ve been use in my zines
for a couple of years. I made it using a delightful app called
<a href="https://2ttf.com/">iFontMaker</a>. They pitch
themselves on their website as “You can create your handmade typeface in less
than 5 minutes just with your fingers”. In my experience the ‘5 minutes” part
is pretty accurate – I might have spent more like 15 minutes. I’m skeptical
of the “just your fingers” claim – I used an Apple Pencil, which has much
better accuracy. But it is extremely easy to make a TTF font of your
handwriting with the app and if you happen to already have an Apple Pencil and
iPad I think it’s a fun way to spend $7.99.</p>
<p>Here’s what my font looks like. The “CONNECT” text on the left is my actual
handwriting, and the paragraph on the right is the font. There are actually 2
fonts – there’s a regular font and a handwritten “monospace” font. (which
actually isn’t monospace in practice, I haven’t figured out how to make a
actual monospace font in iFontMaker)</p>

</p>
<h3 id="the-goal-have-more-character-variation-in-the-font">the goal: have more character variation in the font</h3>
<p>In the screenshot above, it’s pretty obvious that it’s a font and not actual
handwriting. It’s easiest to see this when you have two of the same letter next
to each other, like in “HTTP’.</p>
<p>So I thought it might be fun to use some OpenType features to somehow introduce
a little more variation into this font, like maybe the two Ts could be
different. I didn’t know how to do this though!</p>
<h3 id="idea-from-tristan-hume-use-opentype">idea from Tristan Hume: use OpenType!</h3>
<p>Then I was at !!Con 2020 in May (all the <a href="http://bangbangcon.com/recordings.html">talk recordings are
here!</a>) and saw this talk by Tristan
Hume about using OpenType to place commas in big numbers by using a special font.
His talk and blog post are both great so here are a bunch of links – the live
demo is maybe the fastest way to see his results.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="the-main-idea-opentype-lets-you-replace-characters-based-on-context">the main idea: OpenType lets you replace characters based on context</h3>
<p>I started out being extremely confused about what OpenType even is. I still don’t know much, but I
learned that you can write extremely simple OpenType rules to change how a
font looks, and you don’t even have to really understand anything about fonts.</p>
<p>Here’s an example rule:</p>
<pre><code>sub a' b by other_a;
</code></pre>
<p>What <code>sub a' b by other_a;</code> means is: If an <code>a</code> glyph is before a <code>b</code>, then replace the <code>a</code> with the glyph <code>other_a</code>.</p>
<p>So this means I can make <code>ab</code> appear different from <code>ac</code> in the font. It’s not
random the way handwriting is, but it does introduce a little bit of variation.</p>
<h3 id="opentype-reference-documentation-awesome">OpenType reference documentation: awesome</h3>
<p>The best documentation I found for OpenType was this <a href="https://adobe-type-tools.github.io/afdko/OpenTypeFeatureFileSpecification.html">OpenType™ Feature File Specification</a> reference. There are a lot of examples of cool things you can do in there, like replace “ffi” with a ligature.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-apply-these-rules-fonttools">how to apply these rules: <code>fonttools</code></h3>
<p>Adding new OpenType rules to a font is extremely easy. There’s a Python library
called <code>fonttools</code>, and these 5 lines of code will apply a list of OpenType
rules (in <code>rules.fea</code>) to the font file <code>input.ttf</code>.</p>
<pre><code>from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont
from fontTools.feaLib.builder import addOpenTypeFeatures

ft_font = TTFont('input.ttf')
addOpenTypeFeatures(ft_font, 'rules.fea', tables=['GSUB'])
ft_font.save('output.ttf')
</code></pre>
<p><code>fontTools</code> also provides a couple of command line tools called <code>ttx</code> and
<code>fonttools</code>. <code>ttx</code> converts a TTF font into an XML file, which was useful to me
because I wanted to rename some glyphs in my font but did not understand
anything about fonts. So I just converted my font into an XML file, used <code>sed</code>
to rename the glyphs, and then used <code>ttx</code> again to convert the XML file back into a <code>ttf</code>.</p>
<p><code>fonttools merge</code> let me merge my 3 handwriting fonts into 1 so that I had all the glyphs I needed in 1 file.</p>
<h3 id="the-code">the code</h3>
<p>I put my extremely hacky code for doing this in a repository called
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/font-mixer/">font-mixer</a>. It’s like 33 lines of code and I think it’s pretty straightforward. (it’s all in <code>run.sh</code> and <code>combine.py</code>)</p>
<h3 id="the-results">the results</h3>
<p>Here’s a small sample the old font and the new font. I don’t think the new font
“feels” that much more like handwriting – there’s a little more variation, but
it still doesn’t compare to actual handwritten text (at the bottom).</p>
<p>It feels a little uncanny valley to me, like it’s obviously still a
font but it’s pretending to be something else.</p>
<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/font-mixer-comparison.png"></p>
<p>And here’s a sample of the same text actually written by hand:</p>
<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/handwriting-sample.jpeg" width="65%"></p>
<p>It’s possible that the results would be better if I was more careful about how
I made the 2 other handwriting fonts I mixed the original font with.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-cool-that-it-s-so-easy-to-add-opentype-rules">it’s cool that it’s so easy to add opentype rules!</h3>
<p>Mostly what was delightful to me here is that it’s so easy to add OpenType
rules to change how fonts work, like you can pretty easily make a font where
the word “the” is always replaced with “teh” (typos all the time!).</p>
<p>I still don’t know how to make a more realistic handwriting font though :).
I’m still using the old one (without the extra variations) and I’m pretty happy with it.</p>
