And even when companies <em>have</em> to disclose the details of a breach, they can get cagey—as we saw with <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://lifehacker.com/when-theres-a-data-breach-always-read-the-fine-print-1836816788&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://lifehacker.com/when-theres-a-data-breach-always-read-the-fine-print-1836816788">Capital One’s recent problems</a></span>.</p><aside class="inset--story branded-item branded-item--lifehacker sc-1rh3ayr-5 kIoxhb" data-commerce-source="inset"><a class="inset--story__thumb sc-1rh3ayr-2 bghZBj js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Permalink page click&quot;,&quot;Permalink page click - inset photo&quot;]]" href="https://lifehacker.com/when-theres-a-data-breach-always-read-the-fine-print-1836816788" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="ynl58c-0 fcMbEd"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="64" height="64" aria-label="Lifehacker avatar" viewBox="0 0 64 64"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path fill="#94B330" d="M0 0h64v64H0z"></path><path fill="#FFF" d="M17 8v48h8V9l-8-1zm13 0h5v14.7c1.35-.42 3.2-.6 4.67-.6C44.9 22.1 49 26.74 49 32v24h-5V32.02c0-2.6-2-4.66-4.63-4.66H35V56h-5V8z"></path></g></svg></span></a></aside><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">It’s not your job to play detective or journalist for all the companies whose services you love and use, but there are a few things you should keep in the back of your mind so you can stay safer about data breaches—especially if a company isn’t forthcoming about them.</p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-0 bTZVlP">Get skeptical about random password-reset requests</h3><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">This one’s a no-brainer, but it’s still worth mentioning. If a website or service asks you to reset your password out of the blue, something is wrong. Ideally, it has detected that your email or username is part of <em>another</em> data breach, and it is helping you secure your account in advance if you <em>happened</em> to <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://lifehacker.com/how-to-create-secure-passwords-that-arent-impossible-to-1825048324&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-create-secure-passwords-that-arent-impossible-to-1825048324">use the same password</a></span> for both services. You should still get suspicious, however, and maybe check the news (or Twitter) to see if anyone is reporting a data breach about the company itself.</p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-0 bTZVlP">Make sure you’re using “Have I Been Pwned”</h3><figure class="align--bleed js_lazy-image js_marquee-assetfigure sc-1eow4w5-1 kivedT" data-id="uotqo6tbgixcgpaik3ie" data-recommend-id="image://uotqo6tbgixcgpaik3ie" data-format="Png" data-width="1326" data-height="663" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="uotqo6tbgixcgpaik3ie" data-recommend-id="image://uotqo6tbgixcgpaik3ie" data-format="Png" data-width="1326" data-height="663" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" class="js_recommend"></span></figure><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">In the off chance that a company isn’t being forthcoming about a data breach, it never hurts to have someone else watching your back. Sign up for notifications from <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Have I Been Pwned</a></span>, which will let you know if, or when, your email address is involved in a hack.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">If you’re <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 iwOlBA js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://lifehacker.com/the-five-best-password-managers-5529133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://lifehacker.com/the-five-best-password-managers-5529133">a 1Password user</a></span>, you can also take advantage of the password manager’s built-in tool that checks to see if your credentials were involved in any breaches.

Some we cover; some we don’t. Typically, if a hack only affects information that isn’t all that interesting, like your email address and your shoe size, it’s not really worth talking about compared to breaches that involve more critical data like account numbers, your plaintext password, or your social security number.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">Whenever a company tells <em>you</em> about a breach that affects your information, don’t just take their word for it. Pretend that every bit of data you sent to that company’s service has also been compromised and act accordingly—whether that means paying closer attention to spending on your associated credit cards (or setting up some kind of notification or alert), changing passwords on other sites, or putting a freeze on your credit reports. You never know when a seemingly innocent hack could spiral into something worse.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">I realize this might sound a bit like “the sky is falling,” but being more proactive about your data security isn’t a bad thing. You can always take a measured response. For example, you probably don’t need to order replacement credit cards every time a website is compromised that you’ve previously purchased an item from, but you might want to make a reminder to check your credit card statement a little more closely for the next month or so.</p><h3 class="sc-1bwb26k-0 bTZVlP">Don’t be afraid to walk away</h3><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">When a company isn’t truthful with you about issues that can have a big impact on your personal privacy and data security, you don’t <em>have</em> to keep using their services. Go find another company that’s willing to go the extra mile to keep your data safe—or, at the bare minimum, give you honest information about any incidents that hit. I’ll take a <em>mea culpa</em> over a lie any day.</p></div></div></div></div>
