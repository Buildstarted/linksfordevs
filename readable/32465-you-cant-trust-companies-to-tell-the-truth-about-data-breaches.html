And while it disclosed <a href="https://stockx.com/news/update-on-data-security-issue/">details on the breach</a> in the end, there&#x2019;s still no explanation for why it took StockX so long to figure out what happened, nor why the company felt the need to muddy the situation with its suspicious password-reset email last week.</p><p>While most companies are fairly responsible about security disclosures, there&#x2019;s no question that plenty would prefer if information about massive security breaches affecting them never hit the public eye. And even when companies <em>have</em> to disclose the details of a breach, they can get cagey&#x2014;as we saw with <a href="https://lifehacker.com/when-theres-a-data-breach-always-read-the-fine-print-1836816788">Capital One&#x2019;s recent problems</a>.</p><aside class="inset--story js_inset branded-item branded-item--lifehacker"><a href="https://lifehacker.com/when-theres-a-data-breach-always-read-the-fine-print-1836816788" class="inset--story__thumb"><figure><picture><source><img class="lazyload" src="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--7OBandAJ--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_77,pg_1,q_80,w_137/yf2ukj4ikicphxvhyoft.jpg" alt="Article preview thumbnail"></picture><svg id="lifehacker-avatar-svg" class="hide"><symbol id="lifehacker-avatar-svgid"><path/><path/></symbol></svg><svg class="gmg-avatar gmg-avatar--lifehacker"><use xlink:href="#lifehacker-avatar-svgid"/></svg></figure></a><div class="inset--story__content"><p>Capital One has already started the notification process for its most recent data breach&#x2014;affecting&#x2026;</p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/when-theres-a-data-breach-always-read-the-fine-print-1836816788" class="js_readmore inset--story__readmore">Read more <span class="js_external-text hide">Read</span></a></div></aside><p>It&#x2019;s not your job to play detective or journalist for all the companies whose services you love and use, but there are a few things you should keep in the back of your mind so you can stay safer about data breaches&#x2014;especially if a company isn&#x2019;t forthcoming about them.</p><h3>Get skeptical about random password-reset requests</h3><p>This one&#x2019;s a no-brainer, but it&#x2019;s still worth mentioning. If a website or service asks you to reset your password out of the blue, something is wrong. Ideally, it has detected that your email or username is part of <em>another</em> data breach, and it is helping you secure your account in advance if you <em>happened</em> to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-create-secure-passwords-that-arent-impossible-to-1825048324">use the same password</a> for both services. You should still get suspicious, however, and maybe check the news (or Twitter) to see if anyone is reporting a data breach about the company itself.</p><h3>Make sure you&#x2019;re using &#x201C;Have I Been Pwned&#x201D;</h3><figure class="js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed"><div class="js_img-wrapper img-wrapper lazy-image "><div class="img-permalink-sub-wrapper"><span class="js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper"><picture><source class="ls-small-media-source"><source><source><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" class="lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag" alt="Illustration for article titled You Can&amp;#39;t Trust Companies to Tell the Truth About Data Breaches" srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--dvFKWcmJ--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/uotqo6tbgixcgpaik3ie.png 2x, https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--dvFKWcmJ--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/uotqo6tbgixcgpaik3ie.png 3x"></picture></span></div><figcaption class="no-caption">Screenshot:  David Murphy (<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>)</figcaption></div></figure><p>In the off chance that a company isn&#x2019;t being forthcoming about a data breach, it never hurts to have someone else watching your back. Sign up for notifications from <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>, which will let you know if, or when, your email address is involved in a hack.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-five-best-password-managers-5529133">a 1Password user</a>, you can also take advantage of the password manager&#x2019;s built-in tool that checks to see if your credentials were involved in any breaches. It&#x2019;s called <a href="https://support.1password.com/watchtower/">Watchtower</a>, and it&#x2019;s a great way to stay on top of every weekly (daily?) breach that hits.</p><h3>Perform your own threat analysis</h3><p>At Lifehacker, I get to read about a lot of breaches. Some we cover; some we don&#x2019;t. Typically, if a hack only affects information that isn&#x2019;t all that interesting, like your email address and your shoe size, it&#x2019;s not really worth talking about compared to breaches that involve more critical data like account numbers, your plaintext password, or your social security number.</p><p>Whenever a company tells <em>you</em> about a breach that affects your information, don&#x2019;t just take their word for it. Pretend that every bit of data you sent to that company&#x2019;s service has also been compromised and act accordingly&#x2014;whether that means paying closer attention to spending on your associated credit cards (or setting up some kind of notification or alert), changing passwords on other sites, or putting a freeze on your credit reports. You never know when a seemingly innocent hack could spiral into something worse.</p><p>I realize this might sound a bit like &#x201C;the sky is falling,&#x201D; but being more proactive about your data security isn&#x2019;t a bad thing. You can always take a measured response. For example, you probably don&#x2019;t need to order replacement credit cards every time a website is compromised that you&#x2019;ve previously purchased an item from, but you might want to make a reminder to check your credit card statement a little more closely for the next month or so.</p><h3>Don&#x2019;t be afraid to walk away</h3><p>When a company isn&#x2019;t truthful with you about issues that can have a big impact on your personal privacy and data security, you don&#x2019;t <em>have</em> to keep using their services. Go find another company that&#x2019;s willing to go the extra mile to keep your data safe&#x2014;or, at the bare minimum, give you honest information about any incidents that hit. I&#x2019;ll take a <em>mea culpa</em> over a lie any day.</p></div></div>
