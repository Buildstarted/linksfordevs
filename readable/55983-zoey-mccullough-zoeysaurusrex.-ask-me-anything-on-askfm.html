It&#x2019;s rare for me to feel that way but I have felt it both in the past and present. I&#x2019;m very shy and I&#x2019;ll never make the first move, but beyond that, sometimes it&#x2019;s not the right time to tell someone even when you feel it, even when it&#x2019;s the most real thing you&#x2019;ve ever felt. Timing is a bitch. If I have any advice, tell them anyway, especially if you have a hint that it&#x2019;s mutual. Sometimes the present isn&#x2019;t the right time, but who knows what the future holds.<p class="readMore"><a class="button" href="#">View more</a></p></div> </article> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer "> <div class="streamItem_content">I think you&#x2019;ll find that as long as you treat us as you would anyone else there&#x2019;s no issues. Using our name and pronouns does matter. When you choose not to, its a denial of something innate to us and in the case of our names, the one thing we chose for ourselves in transition.<p class="readMore"><a class="button" href="#">View more</a></p></div> </article> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer "> <div class="streamItem_content">Thank you for this question. I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s appropriate for me to answer this. I think this is something that individual families have to work out for themselves. I know that the research shows that children that transition younger are less likely to attempt suicide and I think that alone says a lot. This is a rare time when I&#x2019;m choosing not to have an opinion about something very rooted in science and psychology.<p class="readMore"><a class="button" href="#">View more</a></p></div> </article> <section class="askfm-ad-slot askfm-ad-slot-mobile-stream-1 rsp-eql-mobile "></section> <section class="askfm-ad-slot askfm-ad-slot-desktop-stream-1 rsp-gte-tablet "></section> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer "> <div class="streamItem_content">It is not a choice to be trans. It is very biological. For example, trans women who choose not to take hormones have had their brains studied after death. They tended to have a hypothalamus that resembled a cisgender woman. That phenomenon isn&#x2019;t seen in gay men.<p class="readMore"><a class="button" href="#">View more</a></p></div> </article> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer "> <div class="streamItem_content">Improvements: It forces me to live each day in order to get through the harder moments. I feel more alive and I feel at home in my own body. Gotten worse: Unfortunately, our social systems are built around presenting as normal in society. People are welcome to argue that normal doesn&#x2019;t exist, but it definitely does when it comes to how societies form. I always thought that women would be much more open to embracing me, but I haven&#x2019;t found that to be true. I&#x2019;ve been excluded from a lot of social situations with women where I feel it would be normal for me to be there.<p class="readMore"><a class="button" href="#">View more</a></p></div> </article> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer "> <div class="streamItem_content">The total list of things that can change from medication alone are much larger than you&#x2019;ll find via a doctors office or scholarly documents (won&#x2019;t go into why this time). Estrogen can cause the following changes (based on my own measurements):- Breast growth- Hip growth- Body fat redistribution- Top layer of skin often thins out- Loss of muscle mass- Decrease in foot size- Softening of skin- Hip growth (not just for those under 25 y/o)- Pelvic tilting<p>- Changes to sweat and body scent</p>These are just a few from estrogen. Most people who choose surgery often do so to remove original characteristics or supplement others. Breast augmentation, vaginoplasty, and facial feminization surgery are just a few.<p class="readMore"><a class="button" href="#">View more</a></p></div> </article> <section class="askfm-ad-slot askfm-ad-slot-mobile-stream-2 rsp-eql-mobile "></section> <section class="askfm-ad-slot askfm-ad-slot-desktop-stream-2 rsp-gte-tablet "></section> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer "> <div class="answerCard "><div class="answerCard_container"><div class="asnwerCard_text">I think it is helpful and important. It&#x2019;s something that can be hard to understand beyond an empathic response. Pronouns, and by extension name, are something that doesn&#x2019;t require a lot of energy for a person who should use them. Refusing to use them shows a lack of basic decency.</div></div></div> </article> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer shorten"> <div class="streamItem_content">Warning NSFW: It for sure has in many ways, both mentally and physically. Mentally, attraction is way different than it used to be. I feel that pre-transition, becoming attracted to someone was easier, and I don&#x2019;t want that to be taken as a slam at men. I more mean that for me to be attracted to someone, it was a bit like solving a three number passcode. If a person had all three numbers, boom, attraction unlocked. Now, it feels like attraction is a twelve number passcode where they need all twelve numbers but they only think they need eleven and I can&#x2019;t explain it to them.Last exit before NSFW:Physically, there have been many changes too. What I want has changed the most. I&#x2019;d be lying if I said that I had any shred of dominance left in my intimate behavior. I don&#x2019;t want to be that at all and there&#x2019;s not really a choice in the matter. As far as physical sensation, all I can say is that the legends are true. Climax now feels different. Afterwards, my legs are weak, my brain is buzzing, and I feel calm. I feel it in my entire body and it doesn&#x2019;t seem to go away quickly. The scariest part perhaps, is that those feelings continue to get stronger as time moves on.<p class="readMore"><a class="button" href="#">View more</a></p></div> </article> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer "> <div class="streamItem_content">When I first started transition, I was 5&#x2019;8&#x201D; tall. Today, standing up as straight as I can, I hit 5&#x2019;6&#x201D;. You might be asking how that&#x2019;s possible. In addition to soft tissue changes, many trans women experience having their pelvis tilt forward a bit. Though I&#x2019;m not sure what caused this in me, those are my suspicions.<p class="readMore"><a class="button" href="#">View more</a></p></div> </article> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer "> <div class="streamItem_content">Unfortunately I don&#x2019;t.

I&#x2019;m not sure my definition really will either because of how it differs from person to person, but here goes. For me, Dysphoria can be compared to an operating system where the user is also part of the OS. Take Windows for example. Most of us who&#x2019;ve used it will customize the colors and desktop to our liking. We pick things that express how we feel in the moment. In Windows, there&#x2019;s several background services that enable your customizations to come to life. To me, Dysphoria is a bit like having one or many background services that aren&#x2019;t working properly. Sure, the OS is still usable, but it isn&#x2019;t quite right, or sometimes, horribly wrong. Deep down the user knows the OS needs a clean install but that&#x2019;s the nuclear option. So they keep trying tweaks that will never work, they reboot an endless number of times, and sometimes people live with the brokenness. For some, they&#x2019;ve finally had enough with the reboots, hacks, and third party mechanisms of self expression, and they do the clean install. Things are fresh again and working! Except now you&#x2019;ve got to sort through your backups and decide what to restore and what to leave. Some choose to restore a lot, and some little to nothing. That process takes forever. They wait and wait for file copies and installs, dreaming of how to use the clean OS. They get impatient because they don&#x2019;t see the end result very quickly at all. In addition to that, you&#x2019;ve got people who use this computer at times, and they are concerned that the files they like are gone, but they aren&#x2019;t. The user is just trying to decide whether or not the file is worth restoring. So they feel guilty and pressured to restore something that they may not want around anymore. Outside of that, each new customization brings joy and excitement, and terror. Finally, they can set their taskbar to pink, or orange, or blue. Other users come along and comment how they didn&#x2019;t know you even liked pink. They also ask if you like pink because some other user chose pink too. So now we can see our user in a constant loop of feeling excitement and fear for each change because who knows what commentary comes next. Some users are really good at telling commenters to fuck off, and some are trying not to relent back to the safety of conformity. This part of the process is endless potentially. Dysphoria has many facets with their own challenges. Everyone feels it different and to different degrees. Describing it in depth is monumentally difficult.<p class="readMore"><a class="button" href="#">View more</a></p></div> </article> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer "> <div class="streamItem_content">Love is insanely complicated. I&#x2019;ve been told that it exists for evolutionary reasons or that it is also a societal construct. I know this for sure. Each time I&#x2019;ve fallen in love, which typically has happened when I realized someone got me more than anyone in the past, I realize how much I don&#x2019;t understand it. When you meet someone who gets you, connects with you, and gives you the freedom to be yourself, it does amazing things to your brain.<p class="readMore"><a class="button" href="#">View more</a></p></div> </article> <section class="askfm-ad-slot askfm-ad-slot-mobile-stream-4 rsp-eql-mobile "></section> <section class="askfm-ad-slot askfm-ad-slot-desktop-stream-4 rsp-gte-tablet "></section> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer "> <div class="streamItem_content">Overall I&#x2019;ve had very few negative interactions. When I first got my letter to begin HRT, the endo accused me of faking the letter and my therapist came to the rescue. Most of the time though, the endocrinologists I&#x2019;ve seen just don&#x2019;t know enough to understand how to answer questions beyond the basics. A great example of this is the contention, even in the trans community about trans women experiencing PMS. I&#x2019;ve had an endocrinologist say it isn&#x2019;t possible and several that said it absolutely is possible. People like me end up taking our own notes on the experience and sharing them because of that.<p class="readMore"><a class="button" href="#">View more</a></p></div> </article> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer "> <div class="streamItem_content">&#xA1;Muy r&#xE1;pido para la persona adecuada! &#x2764;&#xFE0F;&#x2764;&#xFE0F;&#x2764;&#xFE0F;<p class="readMore"><a class="button" href="#">View more</a></p></div> </article> <article class="item streamItem streamItem-answer "> <div class="streamItem_content">Presently I&#x2019;m injecting estradiol cypionate once a week and I&#x2019;ve just recently restarted spironolactone as a hormone blocker.
