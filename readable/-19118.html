Abstract

   This document defines Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
   (S/MIME) version 4.0.  S/MIME provides a consistent way to send and
   receive secure MIME data.  Digital signatures provide authentication,
   message integrity, and non-repudiation with proof of origin.
   Encryption provides data confidentiality.  Compression can be used to
   reduce data size.  This document obsoletes <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5751">RFC 5751</a>.

<span><h2><a name="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</h2></span>

   S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) provides a
   consistent way to send and receive secure MIME data.  Based on the
   popular Internet MIME standard, S/MIME provides the following
   cryptographic security services for electronic messaging
   applications: authentication, message integrity, and non-repudiation
   of origin (using digital signatures), and data confidentiality (using
   encryption).  As a supplementary service, S/MIME provides message
   compression.

   S/MIME can be used by traditional mail user agents (MUAs) to add
   cryptographic security services to mail that is sent, and to
   interpret cryptographic security services in mail that is received.
   However, S/MIME is not restricted to mail; it can be used with any
   transport mechanism that transports MIME data, such as HTTP or SIP.
   As such, S/MIME takes advantage of the object-based features of MIME
   and allows secure messages to be exchanged in mixed-transport
   systems.

   Further, S/MIME can be used in automated message transfer agents that
   use cryptographic security services that do not require any human
   intervention, such as the signing of software-generated documents and
   the encryption of FAX messages sent over the Internet.

   This document defines version 4.0 of the S/MIME Message
   Specification.  As such, this document obsoletes version 3.2 of the
   S/MIME Message Specification [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5751" title="&quot;Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.2 Message Specification&quot;">RFC5751</a>].

   This specification contains a number of references to documents that
   have been obsoleted or replaced.  This is intentional, as the updated
   documents often do not have the same information or protocol
   requirements in them.

<span><h3><a name="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Specification Overview</h3></span>

   This document describes a protocol for adding cryptographic signature
   and encryption services to MIME data.  The MIME standard [<a href="#ref-MIME-SPEC" title=" [RFC6838">MIME-SPEC</a>]
   provides a general structure for the content of Internet messages and
   allows extensions for new applications based on content-type.

   This specification defines how to create a MIME body part that has
   been cryptographically enhanced according to the Cryptographic
   Message Syntax (CMS) [<a href="#ref-CMS">CMS</a>], which is derived from PKCS #7 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315" title="&quot;PKCS #7: Cryptographic Message Syntax Version 1.5&quot;">RFC2315</a>].
   This specification also defines the application/pkcs7-mime media
   type, which can be used to transport those body parts.

<span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8551">RFC 8551</a>            S/MIME 4.0 Message Specification          April 2019</span>


   This document also discusses how to use the multipart/signed media
   type defined in [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1847" title="&quot;Security Multiparts for MIME: Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted&quot;">RFC1847</a>] to transport S/MIME signed messages.
   multipart/signed is used in conjunction with the
   application/pkcs7-signature media type, which is used to transport a
   detached S/MIME signature.

   In order to create S/MIME messages, an S/MIME agent MUST follow the
   specifications in this document, as well as the specifications listed
   in [<a href="#ref-CMS">CMS</a>], [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3370" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Algorithms&quot;">RFC3370</a>], [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4056" title="&quot;Use of the RSASSA-PSS Signature Algorithm in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)&quot;">RFC4056</a>], [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3560" title="&quot;Use of the RSAES-OAEP Key Transport Algorithm in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)&quot;">RFC3560</a>], and [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5754" title="&quot;Using SHA2 Algorithms with Cryptographic Message Syntax&quot;">RFC5754</a>].

   Throughout this specification, there are requirements and
   recommendations made for how receiving agents handle incoming
   messages.  There are separate requirements and recommendations for
   how sending agents create outgoing messages.  In general, the best
   strategy is to follow the Robustness Principle (be liberal in what
   you receive and conservative in what you send).  Most of the
   requirements are placed on the handling of incoming messages, while
   the recommendations are mostly on the creation of outgoing messages.

   The separation for requirements on receiving agents and sending
   agents also derives from the likelihood that there will be S/MIME
   systems that involve software other than traditional Internet mail
   clients.  S/MIME can be used with any system that transports MIME
   data.  An automated process that sends an encrypted message might not
   be able to receive an encrypted message at all, for example.  Thus,
   the requirements and recommendations for the two types of agents are
   listed separately when appropriate.

   We define the additional requirement levels:

   SHOULD+   This term means the same as SHOULD.  However, the authors
             expect that a requirement marked as SHOULD+ will be
             promoted at some future time to be a MUST.

   SHOULD-   This term means the same as SHOULD.  However, the authors
             expect that a requirement marked as SHOULD- will be demoted
             to a MAY in a future version of this document.

   MUST-     This term means the same as MUST.  However, the authors
             expect that this requirement will no longer be a MUST in a
             future document.  Although its status will be determined at
             a later time, it is reasonable to expect that if a future
             revision of a document alters the status of a MUST-
             requirement, it will remain at least a SHOULD or a SHOULD-.

   The term "RSA" in this document almost always refers to the
   PKCS #1 v1.5 RSA [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2313" title="&quot;PKCS #1: RSA Encryption Version 1.5&quot;">RFC2313</a>] signature or encryption algorithms even
   when not qualified as such.  There are a couple of places where it
   refers to the general RSA cryptographic operation; these can be
   determined from the context where it is used.

<span><h2><a name="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  CMS Options</h2></span>

   CMS allows for a wide variety of options in content, attributes, and
   algorithm support.  This section puts forth a number of support
   requirements and recommendations in order to achieve a base level of
   interoperability among all S/MIME implementations.  [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3370" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Algorithms&quot;">RFC3370</a>] and
   [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5754" title="&quot;Using SHA2 Algorithms with Cryptographic Message Syntax&quot;">RFC5754</a>] provide additional details regarding the use of the
   cryptographic algorithms.  [<a href="#ref-ESS">ESS</a>] provides additional details
   regarding the use of additional attributes.

<span><h3><a name="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  DigestAlgorithmIdentifier</h3></span>

   The algorithms here are used for digesting the body of the message
   and are not the same as the digest algorithms used as part of the
   signature algorithms.  The result of this is placed in the
   message-digest attribute of the signed attributes.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that the algorithm used for digesting the body of the message be of
   similar strength to, or greater strength than, the signature
   algorithm.

   Sending and receiving agents:

   -  MUST support SHA-256.

   -  MUST support SHA-512.

   [<a name="ref-RFC5754" id="ref-RFC5754">RFC5754</a>] provides the details for using these algorithms with
   S/MIME.

<span><h3><a name="section-2.2" href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>.  SignatureAlgorithmIdentifier</h3></span>

   There are different sets of requirements placed on receiving and
   sending agents.  By having the different requirements, the maximum
   amount of interoperability is achieved, as it allows for specialized
   protection of private key material but maximum signature validation.

   Receiving agents:

   -  MUST support ECDSA with curve P-256 and SHA-256.

   -  MUST support EdDSA with curve25519 using PureEdDSA mode [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8419" title="&quot;Use of Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) Signatures in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)&quot;">RFC8419</a>].

   -  MUST- support RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 with SHA-256.

   -  SHOULD support the RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS)
      with SHA-256.

   Sending agents:

   -  MUST support at least one of the following algorithms: ECDSA with
      curve P-256 and SHA-256, or EdDSA with curve25519 using PureEdDSA
      mode.

   Receiving and sending agents:

   -  MUST support Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) ephemeral-static
      mode for P-256, as specified in [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5753" title="&quot;Use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Algorithms in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)&quot;">RFC5753</a>].

   When ECDH ephemeral-static is used, a key wrap algorithm is also
   specified in the KeyEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)&quot;">RFC5652</a>].  The
   underlying encryption functions for the key wrap and content-
   encryption algorithms [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3370" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Algorithms&quot;">RFC3370</a>] [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3565" title="&quot;Use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Encryption Algorithm in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)&quot;">RFC3565</a>] and the key sizes for the
   two algorithms MUST be the same (e.g., AES-128 key wrap algorithm
   with AES-128 content-encryption algorithm).  As both 128-bit and
   256-bit AES modes are mandatory to implement as content-encryption
   algorithms (<a href="#section-2.7">Section 2.7</a>), both the AES-128 and AES-256 key wrap
   algorithms MUST be supported when ECDH ephemeral-static is used.
   Recipients MAY enforce this but MUST use the weaker of the two as
   part of any cryptographic strength computations they might do.

   <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> provides information on algorithm support in older
   versions of S/MIME.

<span><h3><a name="section-2.4" href="#section-2.4">2.4</a>.  General Syntax</h3></span>

   There are several CMS content types.  Of these, only the Data,
   SignedData, EnvelopedData, AuthEnvelopedData, and CompressedData
   content types are currently used for S/MIME.

<span><h4><a name="section-2.4.1" href="#section-2.4.1">2.4.1</a>.  Data Content Type</h4></span>

   Sending agents MUST use the id-data content type identifier to
   identify the "inner" MIME message content.  For example, when
   applying a digital signature to MIME data, the CMS SignedData
   encapContentInfo eContentType MUST include the id-data object
   identifier (OID), and the media type MUST be stored in the SignedData
   encapContentInfo eContent OCTET STRING (unless the sending agent is
   using multipart/signed, in which case the eContent is absent, per
   <a href="#section-3.5.3">Section 3.5.3</a> of this document).  As another example, when applying
   encryption to MIME data, the CMS EnvelopedData encryptedContentInfo
   contentType MUST include the id-data OID and the encrypted MIME
   content MUST be stored in the EnvelopedData encryptedContentInfo
   encryptedContent OCTET STRING.

<span><h4><a name="section-2.4.2" href="#section-2.4.2">2.4.2</a>.  SignedData Content Type</h4></span>

   Sending agents MUST use the SignedData content type to apply a
   digital signature to a message or, in a degenerate case where there
   is no signature information, to convey certificates.  Applying a
   signature to a message provides authentication, message integrity,
   and non-repudiation of origin.

<span><h4><a name="section-2.4.3" href="#section-2.4.3">2.4.3</a>.  EnvelopedData Content Type</h4></span>

   This content type is used to apply data confidentiality to a message.
   In order to distribute the symmetric key, a sender needs to have
   access to a public key for each intended message recipient to use
   this service.

<span><h4><a name="section-2.4.4" href="#section-2.4.4">2.4.4</a>.  AuthEnvelopedData Content Type</h4></span>

   This content type is used to apply data confidentiality and message
   integrity to a message.  This content type does not provide
   authentication or non-repudiation.  In order to distribute the
   symmetric key, a sender needs to have access to a public key for each
   intended message recipient to use this service.

<span><h4><a name="section-2.4.5" href="#section-2.4.5">2.4.5</a>.  CompressedData Content Type</h4></span>

   This content type is used to apply data compression to a message.
   This content type does not provide authentication, message integrity,
   non-repudiation, or data confidentiality; it is only used to reduce
   the message's size.

   See <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a> for further guidance on the use of this type in
   conjunction with other CMS types.

<span><h3><a name="section-2.5" href="#section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Attributes and the SignerInfo Type</h3></span>

   The SignerInfo type allows the inclusion of unsigned and signed
   attributes along with a signature.  These attributes can be required
   for the processing of messages (e.g., message digest), information
   the signer supplied (e.g., SMIME capabilities) that should be
   processed, or attributes that are not relevant to the current
   situation (e.g., mlExpansionHistory [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2634" title="&quot;Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME&quot;">RFC2634</a>] for mail viewers).

   Receiving agents MUST be able to handle zero or one instance of each
   of the signed attributes listed here.  Sending agents SHOULD generate
   one instance of each of the following signed attributes in each
   S/MIME message:

   -  Signing time (<a href="#section-2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a> in this document)

   -  SMIME capabilities (<a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a> in this document)

   -  Encryption key Preference (<a href="#section-2.5.3">Section 2.5.3</a> in this document)

   -  Message digest (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652#section-11.2">Section&nbsp;11.2 in [RFC5652]</a>)

   -  Content type (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652#section-11.1">Section&nbsp;11.1 in [RFC5652]</a>)

   Further, receiving agents SHOULD be able to handle zero or one
   instance of the signingCertificate and signingCertificateV2 signed
   attributes, as defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2634#section-5">Section&nbsp;5 of RFC 2634</a> [<a href="#ref-ESS">ESS</a>] and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5035#section-3">Section&nbsp;3
   of RFC 5035</a> [<a href="#ref-ESS">ESS</a>], respectively.

   Sending agents SHOULD generate one instance of the signingCertificate
   or signingCertificateV2 signed attribute in each SignerInfo
   structure.

   Additional attributes and values for these attributes might be
   defined in the future.  Receiving agents SHOULD handle attributes or
   values that they do not recognize in a graceful manner.

   Interactive sending agents that include signed attributes that are
   not listed here SHOULD display those attributes to the user, so that
   the user is aware of all of the data being signed.

<span><h4><a name="section-2.5.1" href="#section-2.5.1">2.5.1</a>.  Signing Time Attribute</h4></span>

   The signingTime attribute is used to convey the time that a message
   was signed.  The time of signing will most likely be created by a
   signer and therefore is only as trustworthy as that signer.





<span>Schaad, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 15]</span></pre>

   Sending agents MUST encode signing time through the year 2049 as
   UTCTime; signing times in 2050 or later MUST be encoded as
   GeneralizedTime.  When the UTCTime CHOICE is used, S/MIME agents MUST
   interpret the year field (YY) as follows:

      If YY is greater than or equal to 50, the year is interpreted as
      19YY; if YY is less than 50, the year is interpreted as 20YY.

   Receiving agents MUST be able to process signingTime attributes that
   are encoded in either UTCTime or GeneralizedTime.

<span><h4><a name="section-2.5.2" href="#section-2.5.2">2.5.2</a>.  SMIMECapabilities Attribute</h4></span>

   The SMIMECapabilities attribute includes signature algorithms (such
   as "sha256WithRSAEncryption"), symmetric algorithms (such as "AES-128
   CBC"), authenticated symmetric algorithms (such as "AES-128 GCM"),
   and key encipherment algorithms (such as "rsaEncryption").  The
   presence of an SMIMECapability attribute containing an algorithm
   implies that the sender can deal with the algorithm as well as
   understand the ASN.1 structures associated with that algorithm.
   There are also several identifiers that indicate support for other
   optional features such as binary encoding and compression.  The
   SMIMECapabilities attribute was designed to be flexible and
   extensible so that, in the future, a means of identifying other
   capabilities and preferences such as certificates can be added in a
   way that will not cause current clients to break.

   If present, the SMIMECapabilities attribute MUST be a
   SignedAttribute.  CMS defines SignedAttributes as a SET OF Attribute.
   The SignedAttributes in a signerInfo MUST include a single instance
   of the SMIMECapabilities attribute.  CMS defines the ASN.1 syntax for
   Attribute to include attrValues SET OF AttributeValue.  An
   SMIMECapabilities attribute MUST only include a single instance of
   AttributeValue.  If a signature is detected as violating these
   requirements, the signature SHOULD be treated as failing.

   The semantics of the SMIMECapabilities attribute specify a partial
   list as to what the client announcing the SMIMECapabilities can
   support.  A client does not have to list every capability it
   supports, and it need not list all its capabilities so that the
   capabilities list doesn't get too long.  In an SMIMECapabilities
   attribute, the OIDs are listed in order of their preference but
   SHOULD be separated logically along the lines of their categories
   (signature algorithms, symmetric algorithms, key encipherment
   algorithms, etc.).






<span>Schaad, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 16]</span></pre>
<hr><!--NewPage--><pre><a name="page-17" id="page-17" href="#page-17"> </a>
<span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8551">RFC 8551</a>            S/MIME 4.0 Message Specification          April 2019</span>


   The structure of the SMIMECapabilities attribute is to facilitate
   simple table lookups and binary comparisons in order to determine
   matches.  For instance, the encoding for the SMIMECapability for
   sha256WithRSAEncryption includes rather than omits the NULL
   parameter.  Because of the requirement for identical encoding,
   individuals documenting algorithms to be used in the
   SMIMECapabilities attribute SHOULD explicitly document the correct
   byte sequence for the common cases.

   For any capability, the associated parameters for the OID MUST
   specify all of the parameters necessary to differentiate between two
   instances of the same algorithm.

   The same OID that is used to identify an algorithm SHOULD also be
   used in the SMIMECapability for that algorithm.  There are cases
   where a single OID can correspond to multiple algorithms.  In these
   cases, a single algorithm MUST be assigned to the SMIMECapability
   using that OID.  Additional OIDs from the smimeCapabilities OID tree
   are then allocated for the other algorithms usages.  For instance, in
   an earlier specification, rsaEncryption was ambiguous because it
   could refer to either a signature algorithm or a key encipherment
   algorithm.  In the event that an OID is ambiguous, it needs to be
   arbitrated by the maintainer of the registered SMIMECapabilities list
   as to which type of algorithm will use the OID, and a new OID MUST be
   allocated under the smimeCapabilities OID to satisfy the other use of
   the OID.

   The registered SMIMECapabilities list specifies the parameters for
   OIDs that need them, most notably key lengths in the case of
   variable-length symmetric ciphers.  In the event that there are no
   differentiating parameters for a particular OID, the parameters MUST
   be omitted and MUST NOT be encoded as NULL.  Additional values for
   the SMIMECapabilities attribute might be defined in the future.
   Receiving agents MUST handle an SMIMECapabilities object that has
   values that it does not recognize in a graceful manner.

<span><h4><a name="section-2.5.3" href="#section-2.5.3">2.5.3</a>.  Encryption Key Preference Attribute</h4></span>

   The encryption key preference attribute allows the signer to
   unambiguously describe which of the signer's certificates has the
   signer's preferred encryption key.  This attribute is designed to
   enhance behavior for interoperating with those clients that use
   separate keys for encryption and signing.  This attribute is used to
   convey to anyone viewing the attribute which of the listed
   certificates is appropriate for encrypting a session key for future
   encrypted messages.

   If present, the SMIMEEncryptionKeyPreference attribute MUST be a
   SignedAttribute.  CMS defines SignedAttributes as a SET OF Attribute.
   The SignedAttributes in a signerInfo MUST include a single instance
   of the SMIMEEncryptionKeyPreference attribute.  CMS defines the ASN.1
   syntax for Attribute to include attrValues SET OF AttributeValue.  An
   SMIMEEncryptionKeyPreference attribute MUST only include a single
   instance of AttributeValue.  If a signature is detected as violating
   these requirements, the signature SHOULD be treated as failing.

   The sending agent SHOULD include the referenced certificate in the
   set of certificates included in the signed message if this attribute
   is used.  The certificate MAY be omitted if it has been previously
   made available to the receiving agent.  Sending agents SHOULD use
   this attribute if the commonly used or preferred encryption
   certificate is not the same as the certificate used to sign the
   message.

   Receiving agents SHOULD store the preference data if the signature on
   the message is valid and the signing time is greater than the
   currently stored value.  (As with the SMIMECapabilities, the clock
   skew SHOULD be checked and the data not used if the skew is too
   great.)  Receiving agents SHOULD respect the sender's encryption key
   preference attribute if possible.  This, however, represents only a
   preference, and the receiving agent can use any certificate in
   replying to the sender that is valid.

<span><h5><a name="section-2.5.3.1" href="#section-2.5.3.1">2.5.3.1</a>.  Selection of Recipient Key Management Certificate</h5></span>

   In order to determine the key management certificate to be used when
   sending a future CMS EnvelopedData message for a particular
   recipient, the following steps SHOULD be followed:

   -  If an SMIMEEncryptionKeyPreference attribute is found in a
      SignedData object received from the desired recipient, this
      identifies the X.509 certificate that SHOULD be used as the X.509
      key management certificate for the recipient.

   -  If an SMIMEEncryptionKeyPreference attribute is not found in a
      SignedData object received from the desired recipient, the set of
      X.509 certificates SHOULD be searched for an X.509 certificate
      with the same subject name as the signer of an X.509 certificate
      that can be used for key management.







<span>Schaad, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 18]</span></pre>

   -  Or, use some other method of determining the user's key management
      key.  If an X.509 key management certificate is not found, then
      encryption cannot be done with the signer of the message.  If
      multiple X.509 key management certificates are found, the S/MIME
      agent can make an arbitrary choice between them.

<span><h3><a name="section-2.6" href="#section-2.6">2.6</a>.  SignerIdentifier SignerInfo Type</h3></span>

   S/MIME v4.0 implementations MUST support both issuerAndSerialNumber
   and subjectKeyIdentifier.  Messages that use the subjectKeyIdentifier
   choice cannot be read by S/MIME v2 clients.

   It is important to understand that some certificates use a value for
   subjectKeyIdentifier that is not suitable for uniquely identifying a
   certificate.  Implementations MUST be prepared for multiple
   certificates for potentially different entities to have the same
   value for subjectKeyIdentifier and MUST be prepared to try each
   matching certificate during signature verification before indicating
   an error condition.

<span><h3><a name="section-2.7" href="#section-2.7">2.7</a>.  ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier</h3></span>

   Sending and receiving agents:

   -  MUST support encryption and decryption with AES-128 GCM and
      AES-256 GCM [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5084" title="&quot;Using AES-CCM and AES-GCM Authenticated Encryption in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)&quot;">RFC5084</a>].

   -  MUST- support encryption and decryption with AES-128 CBC

   -  SHOULD+ support encryption and decryption with ChaCha20-Poly1305
      [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7905" title="&quot;ChaCha20-Poly1305 Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)&quot;">RFC7905</a>].

<span><h4><a name="section-2.7.1" href="#section-2.7.1">2.7.1</a>.  Deciding Which Encryption Method to Use</h4></span>

   When a sending agent creates an encrypted message, it has to decide
   which type of encryption to use.  The decision process involves using
   information garnered from the capabilities lists included in messages
   received from the recipient, as well as out-of-band information such
   as private agreements, user preferences, legal restrictions, and
   so on.

   <a href="#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2</a> defines a method by which a sending agent can
   optionally announce, among other things, its decrypting capabilities
   in its order of preference.  The following method for processing and
   remembering the encryption capabilities attribute in incoming signed
   messages SHOULD be used.




<span>Schaad, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 19]</span></pre>

   -  If the receiving agent has not yet created a list of capabilities
      for the sender's public key, then, after verifying the signature
      on the incoming message and checking the timestamp, the receiving
      agent SHOULD create a new list containing at least the signing
      time and the symmetric capabilities.

   -  If such a list already exists, the receiving agent SHOULD verify
      that the signing time in the incoming message is greater than the
      signing time stored in the list and that the signature is valid.
      If so, the receiving agent SHOULD update both the signing time and
      capabilities in the list.  Values of the signing time that lie far
      in the future (that is, a greater discrepancy than any reasonable
      clock skew), or a capabilities list in messages whose signature
      could not be verified, MUST NOT be accepted.

   The list of capabilities SHOULD be stored for future use in creating
   messages.

   Before sending a message, the sending agent MUST decide whether it is
   willing to use weak encryption for the particular data in the
   message.  If the sending agent decides that weak encryption is
   unacceptable for this data, then the sending agent MUST NOT use a
   weak algorithm.  The decision to use or not use weak encryption
   overrides any other decision in this section about which encryption
   algorithm to use.

   Sections <a href="#section-2.7.1.1">2.7.1.1</a> and <a href="#section-2.7.1.2">2.7.1.2</a> describe the decisions a sending agent
   SHOULD use when choosing which type of encryption will be applied to
   a message.  These rules are ordered, so the sending agent SHOULD make
   its decision in the order given.

<span><h5><a name="section-2.7.1.1" href="#section-2.7.1.1">2.7.1.1</a>.  Rule 1: Known Capabilities</h5></span>

   If the sending agent has received a set of capabilities from the
   recipient for the message the agent is about to encrypt, then the
   sending agent SHOULD use that information by selecting the first
   capability in the list (that is, the capability most preferred by the
   intended recipient) that the sending agent knows how to encrypt.  The
   sending agent SHOULD use one of the capabilities in the list if the
   agent reasonably expects the recipient to be able to decrypt the
   message.

<span><h5><a name="section-2.7.1.2" href="#section-2.7.1.2">2.7.1.2</a>.  Rule 2: Unknown Capabilities, Unknown Version of S/MIME</h5></span>

   If the following two conditions are met, the sending agent SHOULD use
   AES-256 GCM, as AES-256 GCM is a stronger algorithm and is required
   by S/MIME v4.0:




<span>Schaad, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 20]</span></pre>

   -  The sending agent has no knowledge of the encryption capabilities
      of the recipient.

   -  The sending agent has no knowledge of the version of S/MIME used
      or supported by the recipient.

   If the sending agent chooses not to use AES-256 GCM in this step,
   given the presumption is that a client implementing AES-GCM would do
   both AES-256 and AES-128, it SHOULD use AES-128 CBC.

<span><h4><a name="section-2.7.2" href="#section-2.7.2">2.7.2</a>.  Choosing Weak Encryption</h4></span>

   Algorithms such as RC2 are considered to be weak encryption
   algorithms.  Algorithms such as TripleDES are not state of the art
   and are considered to be weaker algorithms than AES.  A sending agent
   that is controlled by a human SHOULD allow a human sender to
   determine the risks of sending data using a weaker encryption
   algorithm before sending the data, and possibly allow the human to
   use a stronger encryption algorithm such as AES GCM or AES CBC even
   if there is a possibility that the recipient will not be able to
   process that algorithm.

<span><h4><a name="section-2.7.3" href="#section-2.7.3">2.7.3</a>.  Multiple Recipients</h4></span>

   If a sending agent is composing an encrypted message to a group of
   recipients where the encryption capabilities of some of the
   recipients do not overlap, the sending agent is forced to send more
   than one message.  Please note that if the sending agent chooses to
   send a message encrypted with a strong algorithm and then send the
   same message encrypted with a weak algorithm, someone watching the
   communications channel could learn the contents of the strongly
   encrypted message simply by decrypting the weakly encrypted message.

<span><h2><a name="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Creating S/MIME Messages</h2></span>

   This section describes the S/MIME message formats and how they are
   created.  S/MIME messages are a combination of MIME bodies and CMS
   content types.  Several media types as well as several CMS content
   types are used.  The data to be secured is always a canonical MIME
   entity.  The MIME entity and other data, such as certificates and
   algorithm identifiers, are given to CMS processing facilities that
   produce a CMS object.  Finally, the CMS object is wrapped in MIME.
   The "Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME" documents [<a href="#ref-ESS">ESS</a>] provide
   descriptions of how nested, secured S/MIME messages are formatted.
   ESS provides a description of how a triple-wrapped S/MIME message is
   formatted using multipart/signed and application/pkcs7-mime for the
   signatures.

   S/MIME provides one format for enveloped-only data, several formats
   for signed-only data, and several formats for signed and enveloped
   data.  Several formats are required to accommodate several
   environments -- in particular, for signed messages.  The criteria for
   choosing among these formats are also described.

   Anyone reading this section is expected to understand MIME as
   described in [<a href="#ref-MIME-SPEC" title=" [RFC6838">MIME-SPEC</a>] and [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1847" title="&quot;Security Multiparts for MIME: Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted&quot;">RFC1847</a>].

<span><h3><a name="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Preparing the MIME Entity for Signing, Enveloping, or Compressing</h3></span>

   S/MIME is used to secure MIME entities.  A MIME message is composed
   of a MIME header and a MIME body.  A body can consist of a single
   MIME entity or a tree of MIME entities (rooted with a multipart).
   S/MIME can be used to secure either a single MIME entity or a tree of
   MIME entities.  These entities can be in locations other than the
   root.  S/MIME can be applied multiple times to different entities in
   a single message.  A MIME entity that is the whole message includes
   only the MIME message headers and MIME body and does not include the
   <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822">rfc822</a> header.  Note that S/MIME can also be used to secure MIME
   entities used in applications other than Internet mail.  For cases
   where protection of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822">rfc822</a> header is required, the use of the
   message/rfc822 media type is explained later in this section.

   The MIME entity that is secured and described in this section can be
   thought of as the "inside" MIME entity.  That is, it is the
   "innermost" object in what is possibly a larger MIME message.
   Processing "outside" MIME entities into CMS EnvelopedData,
   CompressedData, and AuthEnvelopedData content types is described in
   Sections <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a> and <a href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Other documents define additional CMS content
   types; those documents should be consulted for processing those CMS
   content types.

   The procedure for preparing a MIME entity is given in [<a href="#ref-MIME-SPEC" title=" [RFC6838">MIME-SPEC</a>].
   The same procedure is used here with some additional restrictions
   when signing.  The description of the procedures from [<a href="#ref-MIME-SPEC" title=" [RFC6838">MIME-SPEC</a>] is
   repeated here, but it is suggested that the reader refer to those
   documents for the exact procedures.  This section also describes
   additional requirements.

   A single procedure is used for creating MIME entities that are to
   have any combination of signing, enveloping, and compressing applied.
   Some additional steps are recommended to defend against known
   corruptions that can occur during mail transport that are of
   particular importance for clear-signing using the multipart/signed
   format.  It is recommended that these additional steps be performed
   on enveloped messages, or signed and enveloped messages, so that the
   messages can be forwarded to any environment without modification.

   These steps are descriptive rather than prescriptive.  The
   implementer is free to use any procedure as long as the result is
   the same.

   Step 1.  The MIME entity is prepared according to local conventions.

   Step 2.  The leaf parts of the MIME entity are converted to
            canonical form.

   Step 3.  Appropriate transfer encoding is applied to the leaves
            of the MIME entity.

   When an S/MIME message is received, the security services on the
   message are processed, and the result is the MIME entity.  That MIME
   entity is typically passed to a MIME-capable user agent where it is
   further decoded and presented to the user or receiving application.

   In order to protect outer, non-content-related message header fields
   (for instance, the "Subject", "To", "From", and "Cc" fields), the
   sending client MAY wrap a full MIME message in a message/rfc822
   wrapper in order to apply S/MIME security services to these header
   fields.  It is up to the receiving client to decide how to present
   this "inner" header along with the unprotected "outer" header.  Given
   the security difference between headers, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   receiving client provide a distinction between header fields,
   depending on where they are located.

   When an S/MIME message is received, if the top-level protected MIME
   entity has a Content-Type of message/rfc822, it can be assumed that
   the intent was to provide header protection.  This entity SHOULD be
   presented as the top-level message, taking into account
   header-merging issues as previously discussed.

<span><h4><a name="section-3.1.1" href="#section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Canonicalization</h4></span>

   Each MIME entity MUST be converted to a canonical form that is
   uniquely and unambiguously representable in the environment where the
   signature is created and the environment where the signature will be
   verified.  MIME entities MUST be canonicalized for enveloping and
   compressing as well as signing.

   The exact details of canonicalization depend on the actual media type
   and subtype of an entity and are not described here.  Instead, the
   standard for the particular media type SHOULD be consulted.  For
   example, canonicalization of type text/plain is different from
   canonicalization of audio/basic.  Other than text types, most types
   have only one representation, regardless of computing platform or
   environment, that can be considered their canonical representation.



<span>Schaad, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 23]</span></pre>

   In general, canonicalization will be performed by the non-security
   part of the sending agent rather than the S/MIME implementation.

   The most common and important canonicalization is for text, which is
   often represented differently in different environments.  MIME
   entities of major type "text" MUST have both their line endings and
   character set canonicalized.  The line ending MUST be the pair of
   characters &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;, and the charset SHOULD be a registered charset
   [<a href="#ref-CHARSETS" title="&quot;Character sets assigned by IANA&quot;">CHARSETS</a>].  The details of the canonicalization are specified in
   [<a href="#ref-MIME-SPEC" title=" [RFC6838">MIME-SPEC</a>].

   Note that some charsets such as ISO-2022 have multiple
   representations for the same characters.  When preparing such text
   for signing, the canonical representation specified for the charset
   MUST be used.

<span><h4><a name="section-3.1.2" href="#section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  Transfer Encoding</h4></span>

   When generating any of the secured MIME entities below, except the
   signing using the multipart/signed format, no transfer encoding is
   required at all.  S/MIME implementations MUST be able to deal with
   binary MIME objects.  If no Content-Transfer-Encoding header field is
   present, the transfer encoding is presumed to be 7BIT.

   As a rule, S/MIME implementations SHOULD use transfer encoding as
   described in <a href="#section-3.1.3">Section 3.1.3</a> for all MIME entities they secure.  The
   reason for securing only 7-bit MIME entities, even for enveloped data
   that is not exposed to the transport, is that it allows the MIME
   entity to be handled in any environment without changing it.  For
   example, a trusted gateway might remove the envelope, but not the
   signature, of a message, and then forward the signed message on to
   the end recipient so that they can verify the signatures directly.
   If the transport internal to the site is not 8-bit clean, such as on
   a wide-area network with a single mail gateway, verifying the
   signature will not be possible unless the original MIME entity was
   only 7-bit data.

   In the case where S/MIME implementations can determine that all
   intended recipients are capable of handling inner (all but the
   outermost) binary MIME objects, implementations SHOULD use binary
   encoding as opposed to a 7-bit-safe transfer encoding for the inner
   entities.  The use of a 7-bit-safe encoding (such as base64)
   unnecessarily expands the message size.  Implementations MAY
   determine that recipient implementations are capable of
   handling inner binary MIME entities by (1) interpreting the
   id-cap-preferBinaryInside SMIMECapabilities attribute, (2) prior
   agreement, or (3) other means.




<span>Schaad, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 24]</span></pre>

   If one or more intended recipients are unable to handle inner binary
   MIME objects or if this capability is unknown for any of the intended
   recipients, S/MIME implementations SHOULD use transfer encoding as
   described in <a href="#section-3.1.3">Section 3.1.3</a> for all MIME entities they secure.

<span><h4><a name="section-3.1.3" href="#section-3.1.3">3.1.3</a>.  Transfer Encoding for Signing Using multipart/signed</h4></span>

   If a multipart/signed entity is ever to be transmitted over the
   standard Internet SMTP infrastructure or other transport that is
   constrained to 7-bit text, it MUST have transfer encoding applied so
   that it is represented as 7-bit text.  MIME entities that are already
   7-bit data need no transfer encoding.  Entities such as 8-bit text
   and binary data can be encoded with quoted-printable or base64
   transfer encoding.

   The primary reason for the 7-bit requirement is that the Internet
   mail transport infrastructure cannot guarantee transport of 8-bit or
   binary data.  Even though many segments of the transport
   infrastructure now handle 8-bit and even binary data, it is sometimes
   not possible to know whether the transport path is 8-bit clean.  If a
   mail message with 8-bit data were to encounter a message transfer
   agent that cannot transmit 8-bit or binary data, the agent has three
   options, none of which are acceptable for a clear-signed message:

   -  The agent could change the transfer encoding; this would
      invalidate the signature.

   -  The agent could transmit the data anyway, which would most likely
      result in the 8th bit being corrupted; this too would invalidate
      the signature.

   -  The agent could return the message to the sender.

   [<a name="ref-RFC1847" id="ref-RFC1847">RFC1847</a>] prohibits an agent from changing the transfer encoding of
   the first part of a multipart/signed message.  If a compliant agent
   that cannot transmit 8-bit or binary data encountered a
   multipart/signed message with 8-bit or binary data in the first part,
   it would have to return the message to the sender as undeliverable.

<span><h4><a name="section-3.1.4" href="#section-3.1.4">3.1.4</a>.  Sample Canonical MIME Entity</h4></span>

   This example shows a multipart/mixed message with full transfer
   encoding.  This message contains a text part and an attachment.  The
   sample message text includes characters that are not ASCII and thus
   need to be transfer encoded.  Though not shown here, the end of each
   line is &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.  The line ending of the MIME headers, the text, and
   the transfer-encoded parts all MUST be &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.

   =A1Hola Michael!

   How do you like the new S/MIME specification?

   It's generally a good idea to encode lines that begin with
   From=20because some mail transport agents will insert a
   greater-than (&gt;) sign, thus invalidating the signature.

   Also, in some cases it might be desirable to encode any =20
   trailing whitespace that occurs on lines in order to ensure =20
   that the message signature is not invalidated when passing =20
   a gateway that modifies such whitespace (like BITNET). =20

<span><h3><a name="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  The application/pkcs7-mime Media Type</h3></span>

   The application/pkcs7-mime media type is used to carry CMS content
   types, including EnvelopedData, SignedData, and CompressedData.  The
   details of constructing these entities are described in subsequent
   sections.  This section describes the general characteristics of the
   application/pkcs7-mime media type.

   The carried CMS object always contains a MIME entity that is prepared
   as described in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> if the eContentType is id-data.  Other
   contents MAY be carried when the eContentType contains different
   values.  See [<a href="#ref-ESS">ESS</a>] for an example of this with signed receipts.

   Since CMS content types are binary data, in most cases base64
   transfer encoding is appropriate -- in particular, when used with
   SMTP transport.  The transfer encoding used depends on the transport



<span>Schaad, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 26]</span></pre>
<hr><!--NewPage--><pre><a name="page-27" id="page-27" href="#page-27"> </a>

   through which the object is to be sent and is not a characteristic of
   the media type.

   Note that this discussion refers to the transfer encoding of the CMS
   object or "outside" MIME entity.  It is completely distinct from, and
   unrelated to, the transfer encoding of the MIME entity secured by the
   CMS object -- the "inside" object, which is described in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.

   Because there are several types of application/pkcs7-mime objects, a
   sending agent SHOULD do as much as possible to help a receiving agent
   know about the contents of the object without forcing the receiving
   agent to decode the ASN.1 for the object.  The Content-Type header
   field of all application/pkcs7-mime objects SHOULD include the
   optional "smime-type" parameter, as described in the following
   sections.

<span><h4><a name="section-3.2.1" href="#section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  The name and filename Parameters</h4></span>

   For application/pkcs7-mime, sending agents SHOULD emit the
   optional "name" parameter to the Content-Type field for compatibility
   with older systems.  Sending agents SHOULD also emit the optional
   Content-Disposition field [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2183" title="&quot;Communicating Presentation Information in Internet Messages: The Content-Disposition Header Field&quot;">RFC2183</a>] with the "filename" parameter.
   If a sending agent emits the above parameters, the value of the
   parameters SHOULD be a filename with the appropriate extension:

                                                                File
   Media Type                                                Extension
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   application/pkcs7-mime (SignedData, EnvelopedData,           .p7m
      AuthEnvelopedData)
   application/pkcs7-mime (degenerate SignedData certificate    .p7c
      management message)
   application/pkcs7-mime (CompressedData)                      .p7z
   application/pkcs7-signature (SignedData)                     .p7s

   In addition, the filename SHOULD be limited to eight characters
   followed by a three-letter extension.  The eight-character filename
   base can be any distinct name; the use of the filename base "smime"
   SHOULD be used to indicate that the MIME entity is associated with
   S/MIME.

   Including a filename serves two purposes.  It facilitates easier use
   of S/MIME objects as files on disk.  It also can convey type
   information across gateways.  When a MIME entity of type
   application/pkcs7-mime (for example) arrives at a gateway that has no
   special knowledge of S/MIME, it will default the entity's media type
   to application/octet-stream and treat it as a generic attachment,
   thus losing the type information.  However, the suggested filename

   for an attachment is often carried across a gateway.  This often
   allows the receiving systems to determine the appropriate application
   to hand the attachment off to -- in this case, a standalone S/MIME
   processing application.  Note that this mechanism is provided as a
   convenience for implementations in certain environments.  A proper
   S/MIME implementation MUST use the media types and MUST NOT rely on
   the file extensions.

<span><h4><a name="section-3.2.2" href="#section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>.  The smime-type Parameter</h4></span>

   The application/pkcs7-mime content type defines the optional
   "smime-type" parameter.  The intent of this parameter is to convey
   details about the security applied (signed or enveloped) along with
   information about the contained content.  This specification defines
   the following smime-types.

       Name                   CMS Type              Inner Content
       ----------------------------------------------------------
       enveloped-data         EnvelopedData         id-data
       signed-data            SignedData            id-data
       certs-only             SignedData            id-data
       compressed-data        CompressedData        id-data
       authEnveloped-data     AuthEnvelopedData     id-data

   In order for consistency to be obtained with future specifications,
   the following guidelines SHOULD be followed when assigning a new
   smime-type parameter.

   1.  If both signing and encryption can be applied to the content,
       then three values for smime-type SHOULD be assigned: "signed-*",
       "authEnv-*", and "enveloped-*".  If one operation can be
       assigned, then this can be omitted.  Thus, since "certs-only" can
       only be signed, "signed-" is omitted.

   2.  A common string for a content OID SHOULD be assigned.  We use
       "data" for the id-data content OID when MIME is the inner
       content.

   3.  If no common string is assigned, then the common string of
       "OID.&lt;oid&gt;" is recommended (for example,
       "OID.2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2" would be AES-128 CBC).

   It is explicitly intended that this field be a suitable hint for mail
   client applications to indicate whether a message is "signed",
   "authEnveloped", or "enveloped" without having to tunnel into the CMS
   payload.

   A registry for additional smime-type parameter values has been

<span><h3><a name="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Creating an Enveloped-Only Message</h3></span>

   This section describes the format for enveloping a MIME entity
   without signing it.  It is important to note that sending enveloped
   but not signed messages does not provide for data integrity.  The
   "enveloped-only" structure does not support authenticated symmetric
   algorithms.  Use the "authenticated enveloped" structure for these
   algorithms.  Thus, it is possible to replace ciphertext in such a way
   that the processed message will still be valid, but the meaning can
   be altered.

   Step 1.  The MIME entity to be enveloped is prepared according to
            <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.

   Step 2.  The MIME entity and other required data are processed into a
            CMS object of type EnvelopedData.  In addition to encrypting
            a copy of the content-encryption key (CEK) for each
            recipient, a copy of the CEK SHOULD be encrypted for the
            originator and included in the EnvelopedData (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652#section-6">[RFC5652],
            Section&nbsp;6</a>).

   Step 3.  The EnvelopedData object is wrapped in a CMS ContentInfo
            object.

   Step 4.  The ContentInfo object is inserted into an
            application/pkcs7-mime MIME entity.

   The smime-type parameter for enveloped-only messages is
   "enveloped-data".  The file extension for this type of message
   is ".p7m".

   A sample message would be:

   Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime; name=smime.p7m;
      smime-type=enveloped-data
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
   Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=smime.p7m

<span><h3><a name="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Creating an Authenticated Enveloped-Only Message</h3></span>

   This section describes the format for enveloping a MIME entity
   without signing it.  Authenticated enveloped messages provide
   confidentiality and data integrity.  It is important to note that
   sending authenticated enveloped messages does not provide for proof
   of origination when using S/MIME.  It is possible for a third party
   to replace ciphertext in such a way that the processed message will
   still be valid, but the meaning can be altered.  However, this is
   substantially more difficult than it is for an enveloped-only
   message, as the algorithm does provide a level of authentication.
   Any recipient for whom the message is encrypted can replace it
   without detection.

   Step 1.  The MIME entity to be enveloped is prepared according to
            <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.

   Step 2.  The MIME entity and other required data are processed into a
            CMS object of type AuthEnvelopedData.  In addition to
            encrypting a copy of the CEK for each recipient, a copy of
            the CEK SHOULD be encrypted for the originator and included
            in the AuthEnvelopedData (see [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5083" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type&quot;">RFC5083</a>]).

   Step 3.  The AuthEnvelopedData object is wrapped in a CMS ContentInfo
            object.

   Step 4.  The ContentInfo object is inserted into an
            application/pkcs7-mime MIME entity.

   The smime-type parameter for authenticated enveloped-only messages is
   "authEnveloped-data".  The file extension for this type of message
   is ".p7m".

<span><h3><a name="section-3.5" href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Creating a Signed-Only Message</h3></span>

   There are two formats for signed messages defined for S/MIME:

   -  application/pkcs7-mime with SignedData.

   -  multipart/signed.

   In general, the multipart/signed form is preferred for sending, and
   receiving agents MUST be able to handle both.

<span><h4><a name="section-3.5.1" href="#section-3.5.1">3.5.1</a>.  Choosing a Format for Signed-Only Messages</h4></span>

   There are no hard-and-fast rules as to when a particular signed-only
   format is chosen.  It depends on the capabilities of all the
   receivers and the relative importance of receivers with S/MIME
   facilities being able to verify the signature versus the importance
   of receivers without S/MIME software being able to view the message.

   Messages signed using the multipart/signed format can always be
   viewed by the receiver whether or not they have S/MIME software.
   They can also be viewed whether they are using a MIME-native user
   agent or they have messages translated by a gateway.  In this
   context, "be viewed" means the ability to process the message
   essentially as if it were not a signed message, including any other
   MIME structure the message might have.

   Messages signed using the SignedData format cannot be viewed by a
   recipient unless they have S/MIME facilities.  However, the
   SignedData format protects the message content from being changed by
   benign intermediate agents.  Such agents might do line wrapping or
   content-transfer encoding changes that would break the signature.

<span><h4><a name="section-3.5.2" href="#section-3.5.2">3.5.2</a>.  Signing Using application/pkcs7-mime with SignedData</h4></span>

   This signing format uses the application/pkcs7-mime media type.  The
   steps to create this format are as follows:

   Step 1.  The MIME entity is prepared according to <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.

   Step 2.  The MIME entity and other required data are processed into a
            CMS object of type SignedData.

   Step 3.  The SignedData object is wrapped in a CMS ContentInfo
            object.

   Step 4.  The ContentInfo object is inserted into an
            application/pkcs7-mime MIME entity.

   The smime-type parameter for messages using application/pkcs7-mime
   with SignedData is "signed-data".  The file extension for this type
   of message is ".p7m".

<span><h4><a name="section-3.5.3" href="#section-3.5.3">3.5.3</a>.  Signing Using the multipart/signed Format</h4></span>

   This format is a clear-signing format.  Recipients without any S/MIME
   or CMS processing facilities are able to view the message.  It makes
   use of the multipart/signed media type described in [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1847" title="&quot;Security Multiparts for MIME: Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted&quot;">RFC1847</a>].  The
   multipart/signed media type has two parts.  The first part contains
   the MIME entity that is signed; the second part contains the
   "detached signature" CMS SignedData object in which the
   encapContentInfo eContent field is absent.

<span><h5><a name="section-3.5.3.1" href="#section-3.5.3.1">3.5.3.1</a>.  The application/pkcs7-signature Media Type</h5></span>

   This media type always contains a CMS ContentInfo containing a single
   CMS object of type SignedData.  The SignedData encapContentInfo
   eContent field MUST be absent.  The signerInfos field contains the
   signatures for the MIME entity.

   The file extension for signed-only messages using
   application/pkcs7-signature is ".p7s".

<span><h5><a name="section-3.5.3.2" href="#section-3.5.3.2">3.5.3.2</a>.  Creating a multipart/signed Message</h5></span>

   Step 1.  The MIME entity to be signed is prepared according to
            <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>, taking special care for clear-signing.

   Step 2.  The MIME entity is presented to CMS processing in order to
            obtain an object of type SignedData in which the
            encapContentInfo eContent field is absent.

   Step 3.  The MIME entity is inserted into the first part of a
            multipart/signed message with no processing other than that
            described in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.

   Step 4.  Transfer encoding is applied to the "detached signature" CMS
            SignedData object, and it is inserted into a MIME entity of
            type application/pkcs7-signature.

   Step 5.  The MIME entity of the application/pkcs7-signature is
            inserted into the second part of the multipart/signed
            entity.

   The multipart/signed Content-Type has two required parameters: the
   protocol parameter and the micalg parameter.

   The protocol parameter MUST be "application/pkcs7-signature".  Note
   that quotation marks are required around the protocol parameter
   because MIME requires that the "/" character in the parameter value
   MUST be quoted.

   The micalg parameter allows for one-pass processing when the
   signature is being verified.  The value of the micalg parameter is
   dependent on the message digest algorithm(s) used in the calculation
   of the Message Integrity Check.  If multiple message digest
   algorithms are used, they MUST be separated by commas per [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1847" title="&quot;Security Multiparts for MIME: Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted&quot;">RFC1847</a>].
   The values to be placed in the micalg parameter SHOULD be from the
   following:

        Algorithm      Value Used
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        MD5*           md5
        SHA-1*         sha-1
        SHA-224        sha-224
        SHA-256        sha-256
        SHA-384        sha-384
        SHA-512        sha-512
        Any other      (defined separately in the algorithm profile
                        or "unknown" if not defined)

   *Note: MD5 and SHA-1 are historical and no longer considered secure.
   See <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> for details.

   (Historical note: Some early implementations of S/MIME emitted and
   expected "rsa-md5", "rsa-sha1", and "sha1" for the micalg parameter.)
   Receiving agents SHOULD be able to recover gracefully from a micalg
   parameter value that they do not recognize.  Future values for this
   parameter will be taken from the IANA "Hash Function Textual Names"
   registry.

<span><h3><a name="section-3.7" href="#section-3.7">3.7</a>.  Multiple Operations</h3></span>

   The signed-only, enveloped-only, and compressed-only MIME formats can
   be nested.  This works because these formats are all MIME entities
   that encapsulate other MIME entities.

   An S/MIME implementation MUST be able to receive and process
   arbitrarily nested S/MIME within reasonable resource limits of the
   recipient computer.

   It is possible to apply any of the signing, encrypting, and
   compressing operations in any order.  It is up to the implementer and
   the user to choose.  When signing first, the signatories are then
   securely obscured by the enveloping.  When enveloping first, the
   signatories are exposed, but it is possible to verify signatures
   without removing the enveloping.  This can be useful in an
   environment where automatic signature verification is desired, as no
   private key material is required to verify a signature.

   There are security ramifications related to choosing whether to sign
   first or encrypt first.  A recipient of a message that is encrypted
   and then signed can validate that the encrypted block was unaltered
   but cannot determine any relationship between the signer and the
   unencrypted contents of the message.  A recipient of a message that
   is signed and then encrypted can assume that the signed message
   itself has not been altered but that a careful attacker could have
   changed the unauthenticated portions of the encrypted message.

   When using compression, keep the following guidelines in mind:

   -  Compression of encrypted data that is transferred as binary data
   is discouraged, since it will not yield significant compression.
   Encrypted data that is transferred as base64-encoded data could
   benefit as well.

   -  If a lossy compression algorithm is used with signing, you will
   need to compress first, then sign.

<span><h3><a name="section-3.8" href="#section-3.8">3.8</a>.  Creating a Certificate Management Message</h3></span>

   The certificate management message or MIME entity is used to
   transport certificates and/or Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs),
   such as in response to a registration request.

   Step 1.  The certificates and/or CRLs are made available to the CMS
            generating process that creates a CMS object of type
            SignedData.  The SignedData encapContentInfo eContent field
            MUST be absent, and the signerInfos field MUST be empty.

   Step 2.  The SignedData object is wrapped in a CMS ContentInfo
            object.

   Step 3.  The ContentInfo object is enclosed in an
            application/pkcs7-mime MIME entity.

   The smime-type parameter for a certificate management message is
   "certs-only".  The file extension for this type of message is ".p7c".

<span><h3><a name="section-3.9" href="#section-3.9">3.9</a>.  Registration Requests</h3></span>

   A sending agent that signs messages MUST have a certificate for the
   signature so that a receiving agent can verify the signature.  There
   are many ways of getting certificates, such as through an exchange
   with a certification authority, through a hardware token or diskette,
   and so on.

   S/MIME v2 [<a href="#ref-SMIMEv2" title="RFC2314">SMIMEv2</a>] specified a method for "registering" public keys
   with certificate authorities using an application/pkcs10 body part.
   Since that time, the IETF PKIX Working Group has developed other
   methods for requesting certificates.  However, S/MIME v4.0 does not
   require a particular certificate request mechanism.

<span><h3><a name="section-3.10" href="#section-3.10">3.10</a>.  Identifying an S/MIME Message</h3></span>

   Because S/MIME takes into account interoperation in non-MIME
   environments, several different mechanisms are employed to carry the
   type information, and it becomes a bit difficult to identify S/MIME
   messages.  The following table lists criteria for determining whether

<span><h2><a name="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Certificate Processing</h2></span>

   A receiving agent MUST provide some certificate retrieval mechanism
   in order to gain access to certificates for recipients of digital
   envelopes.  This specification does not cover how S/MIME agents
   handle certificates -- only what they do after a certificate has been
   validated or rejected.  S/MIME certificate issues are covered in
   [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5750" title="&quot;Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.2 Certificate Handling&quot;">RFC5750</a>].

   At a minimum, for initial S/MIME deployment, a user agent could
   automatically generate a message to an intended recipient requesting
   that recipient's certificate in a signed return message.  Receiving
   and sending agents SHOULD also provide a mechanism to allow a user to
   "store and protect" certificates for correspondents in such a way as
   to guarantee their later retrieval.

   Cryptographic algorithms will be broken or weakened over time.
   Implementers and users need to check that the cryptographic
   algorithms listed in this document continue to provide the expected
   level of security.  The IETF from time to time may issue documents
   dealing with the current state of the art.  For example:

   -  The Million Message Attack described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3218">RFC 3218</a> [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3218" title="&quot;Preventing the Million Message Attack on Cryptographic Message Syntax&quot;">RFC3218</a>].

   -  The Diffie-Hellman "small-subgroup" attacks described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2785">RFC 2785</a>

   -  The attacks against hash algorithms described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4270">RFC 4270</a>
      [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4270" title="&quot;Attacks on Cryptographic Hashes in Internet Protocols&quot;">RFC4270</a>].

   This specification uses Public-Key Cryptography technologies.  It is
   assumed that the private key is protected to ensure that it is not
   accessed or altered by unauthorized parties.

   It is impossible for most people or software to estimate the value of
   a message's content.  Further, it is impossible for most people or
   software to estimate the actual cost of recovering an encrypted
   message's content that is encrypted with a key of a particular size.
   Further, it is quite difficult to determine the cost of a failed
   decryption if a recipient cannot process a message's content.  Thus,
   choosing between different key sizes (or choosing whether to just use
   plaintext) is also impossible for most people or software.  However,
   decisions based on these criteria are made all the time, and
   therefore this specification gives a framework for using those
   estimates in choosing algorithms.

<span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8551">RFC 8551</a>            S/MIME 4.0 Message Specification          April 2019</span>


   The choice of 2048 bits as an RSA asymmetric key size in this
   specification is based on the desire to provide at least 100 bits of
   security.  The key sizes that must be supported to conform to this
   specification seem appropriate for the Internet, based on [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3766" title="&quot;Determining Strengths For Public Keys Used For Exchanging Symmetric Keys&quot;">RFC3766</a>].
   Of course, there are environments, such as financial and medical
   systems, that may select different key sizes.  For this reason, an
   implementation MAY support key sizes beyond those recommended in this
   specification.

   Receiving agents that validate signatures and sending agents that
   encrypt messages need to be cautious of cryptographic processing
   usage when validating signatures and encrypting messages using keys
   larger than those mandated in this specification.  An attacker could
   send certificates with keys that would result in excessive
   cryptographic processing -- for example, keys larger than those
   mandated in this specification, as such keys could swamp the
   processing element.  Agents that use such keys without first
   validating the certificate to a trust anchor are advised to have some
   sort of cryptographic resource management system to prevent such
   attacks.

   Some cryptographic algorithms such as RC2 offer little actual
   security over sending plaintext.  Other algorithms such as TripleDES
   provide security but are no longer considered to be state of the art.
   S/MIME requires the use of current state-of-the-art algorithms such
   as AES and provides the ability to announce cryptographic
   capabilities to parties with whom you communicate.  This allows the
   sender to create messages that can use the strongest common
   encryption algorithm.  Using algorithms such as RC2 is never
   recommended unless the only alternative is no cryptography.

   RSA and DSA keys of less than 2048 bits are now considered by many
   experts to be cryptographically insecure (due to advances in
   computing power) and should no longer be used to protect messages.
   Such keys were previously considered secure, so processing previously
   received signed and encrypted mail will often result in the use of
   weak keys.  Implementations that wish to support previous versions of
   S/MIME or process old messages need to consider the security risks
   that result from smaller key sizes (e.g., spoofed messages) versus
   the costs of denial of service.  If an implementation supports
   verification of digital signatures generated with RSA and DSA keys of
   less than 1024 bits, it MUST warn the user.  Implementers should
   consider providing different warnings for newly received messages and
   previously stored messages.  Server implementations (e.g., secure
   mail list servers) where user warnings are not appropriate SHOULD
   reject messages with weak signatures.

   Implementers SHOULD be aware that multiple active key pairs can be
   associated with a single individual.  For example, one key pair can
   be used to support confidentiality, while a different key pair can be
   used for digital signatures.

   If a sending agent is sending the same message using different
   strengths of cryptography, an attacker watching the communications
   channel might be able to determine the contents of the strongly
   encrypted message by decrypting the weakly encrypted version.  In
   other words, a sender SHOULD NOT send a copy of a message using
   weaker cryptography than they would use for the original of the
   message.

   Modification of the ciphertext in EnvelopedData can go undetected if
   authentication is not also used, which is the case when sending
   EnvelopedData without wrapping it in SignedData or enclosing
   SignedData within it.  This is one of the reasons for moving from
   EnvelopedData to AuthEnvelopedData, as the authenticated encryption
   algorithms provide the authentication without needing the SignedData
   layer.

   If an implementation is concerned about compliance with National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) key size
   recommendations, then see [<a href="#ref-SP800-57" title="&quot;Recommendation for Key Management - Part 1: General&quot;">SP800-57</a>].

   If messaging environments make use of the fact that a message is
   signed to change the behavior of message processing (examples would
   be running rules or UI display hints), without first verifying that
   the message is actually signed and knowing the state of the
   signature, this can lead to incorrect handling of the message.
   Visual indicators on messages may need to have the signature
   validation code checked periodically if the indicator is supposed to
   give information on the current status of a message.

   Many people assume that the use of an authenticated encryption
   algorithm is all that is needed for the sender of the message to be
   authenticated.  In almost all cases, this is not a correct statement.
   There are a number of preconditions that need to hold for an
   authenticated encryption algorithm to provide this service:

   -  The starting key must be bound to a single entity.  The use of a
      group key only would allow for the statement that a message was
      sent by one of the entities that held the key but will not
      identify a specific entity.







<span>Schaad, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 46]</span></pre>

   -  The message must have exactly one sender and one recipient.
      Having more than one recipient would allow for the second
      recipient to create a message that the first recipient would
      believe is from the sender by stripping the second recipient from
      the message.

   -  A direct path needs to exist from the starting key to the key used
      as the CEK.  That path needs to guarantee that no third party
      could have seen the resulting CEK.  This means that one needs to
      be using an algorithm that is called a "Direct Encryption" or a
      "Direct Key Agreement" algorithm in other contexts.  This means
      that the starting key is (1) used directly as the CEK or (2) used
      to create a secret that is then transformed into the CEK via a
      KDF step.

   S/MIME implementations almost universally use ephemeral-static rather
   than static-static key agreement and do not use a shared secret for
   encryption.  This means that the first precondition is not met.
   [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6278" title="&quot;Use of Static-Static Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement in Cryptographic Message Syntax&quot;">RFC6278</a>] defines how to use static-static key agreement with CMS, so
   the first precondition can be met.  Currently, all S/MIME key
   agreement methods derive a key-encryption key (KEK) and wrap a CEK.
   This violates the third precondition above.  New key agreement
   algorithms that directly created the CEK without creating an
   intervening KEK would need to be defined.

   Even when all of the preconditions are met and origination of a
   message is established by the use of an authenticated encryption
   algorithm, users need to be aware that there is no way to prove this
   to a third party.  This is because either of the parties can
   successfully create the message (or just alter the content) based on
   the fact that the CEK is going to be known to both parties.  Thus,
   the origination is always built on a presumption that "I did not send
   this message to myself."

   All of the authenticated encryption algorithms in this document use
   counter mode for the encryption portion of the algorithm.  This means
   that the length of the plaintext will always be known, as the
   ciphertext length and the plaintext length are always the same.  This
   information can enable passive observers to infer information based
   solely on the length of the message.  Applications for which this is
   a concern need to provide some type of padding so that the length of
   the message does not provide this information.

   When compression is used with encryption, it has the potential to
   provide an additional layer of security.  However, care needs to be
   taken when designing a protocol that relies on using compression, so
   as not to create a compression oracle.  Compression oracle attacks
   require an adaptive input to the process and attack the unknown

   content of a message based on the length of the compressed output.
   This means that no attack on the encryption key is necessarily
   required.

   A recent paper on S/MIME and OpenPGP email security [<a href="#ref-Efail" title="&quot;Efail: Breaking S/MIME and OpenPGP Email Encryption using Exfiltration Channels&quot;">Efail</a>] has
   pointed out a number of problems with the current S/MIME
   specifications and how people have implemented mail clients.  Due to
   the nature of how CBC mode operates, the modes allow for malleability
   of plaintexts.  This malleability allows for attackers to make
   changes in the ciphertext and, if parts of the plaintext are known,
   create arbitrary blocks of plaintext.  These changes can be made
   without the weak integrity check in CBC mode being triggered.  This
   type of attack can be prevented by the use of an Authenticated
   Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm with a more robust
   integrity check on the decryption process.  It is therefore
   recommended that mail systems migrate to using AES-GCM as quickly as
   possible and that the decrypted content not be acted on prior to
   finishing the integrity check.

   The other attack that is highlighted in [<a href="#ref-Efail" title="&quot;Efail: Breaking S/MIME and OpenPGP Email Encryption using Exfiltration Channels&quot;">Efail</a>] is due to an error in
   how mail clients deal with HTML and multipart/mixed messages.
   Clients MUST require that a text/html content type be a complete HTML
   document (per [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866" title="&quot;Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0&quot;">RFC1866</a>]).  Clients SHOULD treat each of the different
   pieces of the multipart/mixed construct as being of different
   origins.  Clients MUST treat each encrypted or signed piece of a MIME
   message as being of different origins both from unprotected content
   and from each other.

<span><h2><a name="appendix-B" href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  Historic Mail Considerations</h2></span>

   Over the course of updating the S/MIME specifications, the set of
   recommended algorithms has been modified each time the documents have
   been updated.  This means that if a user has historic emails and
   their user agent has been updated to only support the current set of
   recommended algorithms, some of those old emails will no longer be
   accessible.  It is strongly suggested that user agents implement some
   of the following algorithms for dealing with historic emails.

   This appendix contains a number of references to documents that have
   been obsoleted or replaced.  This is intentional, as the updated
   documents often do not have the same information in them.

<span><h3><a name="appendix-B.1" href="#appendix-B.1">B.1</a>.  DigestAlgorithmIdentifier</h3></span>

   The following algorithms have been called out for some level of
   support by previous S/MIME specifications:

   -  SHA-1 was dropped in [<a href="#ref-SMIMEv4" title="RFC8550">SMIMEv4</a>].  SHA-1 is no longer considered to
      be secure, as it is no longer collision resistant.  The IETF
      statement on SHA-1 can be found in [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6194" title="&quot;Security Considerations for the SHA-0 and SHA-1 Message-Digest Algorithms&quot;">RFC6194</a>], but it is out of
      date relative to the most recent advances.

   -  MD5 was dropped in [<a href="#ref-SMIMEv4" title="RFC8550">SMIMEv4</a>].  MD5 is no longer considered to be
      secure, as it is no longer collision resistant.  Details can be
      found in [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6151" title="&quot;Updated Security Considerations for the MD5 Message-Digest and the HMAC-MD5 Algorithms&quot;">RFC6151</a>].

<span><h3><a name="appendix-B.2" href="#appendix-B.2">B.2</a>.  Signature Algorithms</h3></span>

   There are a number of problems with validating signatures on
   sufficiently historic messages.  For this reason, it is strongly
   suggested that user agents treat these signatures differently from
   those on current messages.  These problems include the following:

   -  Certification authorities are not required to keep certificates on
      a CRL beyond one update after a certificate has expired.  This
      means that unless CRLs are cached as part of the message it is not
      always possible to check to see if a certificate has been revoked.
      The same problems exist with Online Certificate Status Protocol
      (OCSP) responses, as they may be based on a CRL rather than on the
      certificate database.

   -  RSA and DSA keys of less than 2048 bits are now considered by many
      experts to be cryptographically insecure (due to advances in
      computing power).  Such keys were previously considered secure, so
      the processing of historic signed messages will often result in
      the use of weak keys.  Implementations that wish to support
      previous versions of S/MIME or process old messages need to
      consider the security risks that result from smaller key sizes
      (e.g., spoofed messages) versus the costs of denial of service.

      [<a name="ref-SMIMEv3.1" id="ref-SMIMEv3.1">SMIMEv3.1</a>] set the lower limit on suggested key sizes for
      creating and validation at 1024 bits.  Prior to that, the lower
      bound on key sizes was 512 bits.

   -  Hash functions used to validate signatures on historic messages
      may no longer be considered to be secure (see below).  While there
      are not currently any known practical pre-image or second
      pre-image attacks against MD5 or SHA-1, the fact that they are no
      longer considered to be collision resistant implies that the
      security levels of the signatures are generally considered
      suspect.  If a message is known to be historic and it has been in
      the possession of the client for some time, then it might still be
      considered to be secure.

   -  The previous two issues apply to the certificates used to validate
      the binding of the public key to the identity that signed the
      message as well.

   The following algorithms have been called out for some level of
   support by previous S/MIME specifications:

   -  RSA with MD5 was dropped in [<a href="#ref-SMIMEv4" title="RFC8550">SMIMEv4</a>].  MD5 is no longer
      considered to be secure, as it is no longer collision resistant.
      Details can be found in [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6151" title="&quot;Updated Security Considerations for the MD5 Message-Digest and the HMAC-MD5 Algorithms&quot;">RFC6151</a>].

   -  RSA and DSA with SHA-1 were dropped in [<a href="#ref-SMIMEv4" title="RFC8550">SMIMEv4</a>].  SHA-1 is no
      longer considered to be secure, as it is no longer collision
      resistant.  The IETF statement on SHA-1 can be found in [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6194" title="&quot;Security Considerations for the SHA-0 and SHA-1 Message-Digest Algorithms&quot;">RFC6194</a>],
      but it is out of date relative to the most recent advances.

   -  DSA with SHA-256 was dropped in [<a href="#ref-SMIMEv4" title="RFC8550">SMIMEv4</a>].  DSA has been replaced
      by elliptic curve versions.

   As requirements for "mandatory to implement" have changed over time,
   some issues have been created that can cause interoperability
   problems:

   -  S/MIME v2 clients are only required to verify digital signatures
      using the rsaEncryption algorithm with SHA-1 or MD5 and might not
      implement id-dsa-with-sha1 or id-dsa at all.

   -  S/MIME v3 clients might only implement signing or signature
      verification using id-dsa-with-sha1 and might also use id-dsa as
      an AlgorithmIdentifier in this field.

   -  Note that S/MIME v3.1 clients support verifying id-dsa-with-sha1
      and rsaEncryption and might not implement sha256WithRSAEncryption.

   NOTE: Receiving clients SHOULD recognize id-dsa as equivalent to
   id-dsa-with-sha1.

   For 512-bit RSA with SHA-1, see [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3370" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Algorithms&quot;">RFC3370</a>] and [<a href="#ref-FIPS186-2" title="&quot;Digital Signature Standard (DSS) (also with Change Notice 1)&quot;">FIPS186-2</a>] without

   The following algorithms have been called out for some level of

   -  RC2/40 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2268" title="&quot;A Description of the RC2(r) Encryption Algorithm&quot;">RFC2268</a>] was dropped in [<a href="#ref-SMIMEv3.2" title="RFC3852">SMIMEv3.2</a>].  The algorithm is

      decrypt existing email.

   -  DES EDE3 CBC [<a href="#ref-TripleDES" title="&quot;Hellman Presents No Shortcut Solutions to the DES&quot;">TripleDES</a>], also known as "tripleDES", was dropped
      in [<a href="#ref-SMIMEv4" title="RFC8550">SMIMEv4</a>].  This algorithm is removed from the list of
      supported algorithms because (1) it has a 64-bit block size and
      (2) it offers less than 128 bits of security.  This algorithm
      should be supported only to decrypt existing email; it should not
      be used to encrypt new emails.

   -  RSA key sizes have been increased over time.  Decrypting old mail
      with smaller key sizes is reasonable; however, new mail should use
      the updated key sizes.

   For 1024-bit DH, see [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3370" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Algorithms&quot;">RFC3370</a>].  For 1024-bit and larger DH, see

   Some of the examples in this document were copied from [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4134" title="&quot;Examples of S/MIME Messages&quot;">RFC4134</a>].
   Thanks go to the people who wrote and verified the examples in that
   document.

   A number of the members of the S/MIME Working Group have also worked
   very hard and contributed to this document.  Any list of people is
   doomed to omission, and for that I apologize.  In alphabetical order,
   the following people stand out in my mind because they made direct
   contributions to this document:

   Tony Capel, Piers Chivers, Dave Crocker, Bill Flanigan, Peter
   Gutmann, Alfred Hoenes, Paul Hoffman, Russ Housley, William Ottaway,
   and John Pawling.

   The version 4 update to the S/MIME documents was done under the
   auspices of the LAMPS Working Group.
