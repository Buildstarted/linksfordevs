Also, to keep pace with these demands, Microsoft has revamped their complete web stack with ASP.NET Core to meet these architectural demands.</p><p>Needless to say, you also have to secure these apps.</p><p>Multi-platform, multi-client, and highly-mobile users bring a new set of challenges, so the approaches of the past are no longer appropriate for modern applications. This three-day workshop is your chance to dive into all things security related to these new technologies. Learn how to securely connect native and browser-based applications to your back-ends and integrate them with enterprise identity management systems as well as social identity providers and services.</p><p>This workshop covers everything you need to know to build modern and secure web, native &amp; mobile applications. The foundation will be Microsoft’s latest technology stack, but will also include IdentityServer4, which is the officially recommended framework for building token services.</p><p>This workshop can be delivered onsite (<a title="IdentityServer Consulting" href="mailto:contact@identityserver.io?subject=onsite training request">contact us for more info</a>), and publicly as listed below.</p></div></div></div></div>
