<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Someone (the government)  is spying on us with hidden cameras. They aren’t even password protected.</p>

<p>So, I was just browsing looking at unsecured webcams the other day, as one does, when I came across these controllable cameras with really weird perspectives. Next, I noticed they seem to be in a box with glass on three sides, with large stickers reading “DANGER, HIGH VOLTAGE” on two of the sides. I have found at least 9 of these cameras, and one that literally has a “drug Enforcement Agency” label printed on the inside.</p>

<p>Things that make me believe this is the government:</p>

<p>-Super high quality cameras. A peeping tom would probably be better off with a lifetime porn hub subscription than to buy one of these to look in an old ladies window. I’m able to zoom in and read the lettering off a sign 968 feet away (as measured on google earth). I literally feel like a guy on CSI saying “Enhance” and the license plate on a car hundreds of feet away comes clearly into view.</p>

<p>-Installation. Of the cameras I’ve found, they are installed in places where Creepy uncle Joe with a 40’ ladder would look out of place. I can control the cameras and look at the hardware in the box, and it appears to be stealing power off the pole. It does remind me of the TV show Burn notice, one of the spy tips was “if you label something as high voltage on a telephone pole, even linemen won't be too inclined to mess with it”</p>

<p>-They appear to be using VPNsNone of the IPs trace back near their original location.</p>

<p>-I’ve found articles where cities are buying these, and I’ve even found a website that shows what a box may look like, but it’s not a 100% match. I suppose keeping something like that secret would be beneficial to prevent them from being stolen. <a href="http://www.qpcs.net/products/the-rsu-platform/rsu-covert/">http://www.qpcs.net/products/the-rsu-platform/rsu-covert/</a></p>

<p>Okay, I wrote that first half while I only had found two. Here is the status now, I have found 9 High voltage boxes, one DEA box, and a few regular traffic cameras. A lot of them pointed in people’s windows. I do not know if that is other people looking for unsecured cameras, or an operator.</p>

<p>Here are articles supporting the fact that the DEA and ICE are using these pole mounted cameras.</p>

<p>Here are the links to look at the cameras and their location. I’m not including the DEA camera I stumbled on, as it is clearly part of an ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>Update: you can control the camera by clicking the box on the lower right, then adjust with the bars on either side, or even zoom in. ANYONE can control. with all yall looking around some are bound to get pointed at the inside of the box, that's why they'd be black.</p>

<p>Update 1700 UTC.</p>

<p>Men in high visibility vests with masks had been spotted working on the Queens camera, it is now offline, at least for me. Farmdale Ave Los Angeles camera is IDed as a LAPD Gang and Narcotics camera. </p>

<p>Common question: How did I find these. There is a website called insacam.org that crawls around google and picks up all these unsecured cameras. A lot of them are just pictures of billboards or a parking lot somewhere in China, But I got good at knowing what to look for and where to look. It just became kinda a gut thing, I’ve always been good with that sort of thing. I didn’t run out of cameras to find, I just stopped looking after I found these. After finding the box with a printer label that said “Drug Enforcement Agency” it made my stomach feel funny, and I figured it was time to switch from Search to spread. These are just the ones where the IP says they are in a west coast time zone. I'm sure there are more out there. </p>

<p>Again, I am not here for Karma, I am here because this is messed up. Feel free to copy and paste, and send wherever you’d like. I don’t know if it’s my VPN, my nerves, the traffic to these cameras from reddit, or something more tinfoil hat sounding, but my computer has slowed down considerably. </p>

<p>Bella ciao</p>
