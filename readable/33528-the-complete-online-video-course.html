    <h1>The Complete&#xA0;Online Video Course</h1>
    <body> <header> </header> <h2>Confidently design <strong><em>beautiful</em></strong><br class="desktop-only"> user interfaces for any app or site.</h2> <section> <p><span class="lede">Let me save you some time.</span> Honestly, there&apos;s only one reason to read anything on this page, and it&apos;s this: you want to learn how to create <strong>great-looking user interfaces</strong>.</p> <p>If that&#x2019;s not you, you can bounce along now. No hard feelings.</p> <p>OK. Still with me?</p> <p>I&apos;m going to paint a little picture. You can tell if me if this is you or not. You <em>want</em> to learn UI design, but you feel it&apos;s confusing and open-ended. You find the advice out there vague, contradictory, and not really that useful.</p> <p>When you look at design topics like typography, color, or process, you&#x2019;re thinking: <em>crap, I can&#x2019;t do this!</em></p> <p>And what makes for beautiful design seems like some mix of:</p> <ul> <li>Subjective</li> <li>Arbitrary</li> <li>Easy to recognize, but difficult to create</li> </ul> <p>All of this is a view I know all too well.</p> <p>When I was a developer and PM, this was the boat I was floating in every dang day. I saw all these awesome-looking designs, and could even tell you which ones I liked the best, but when it came to recreating something similar for myself, I was hopeless.</p> <p>I saw UI designers as magical creatures who sprinkle mysterious <em>design dust</em> over any wireframe and make it shine. It seemed like some <em>art school voodoo</em> that was completely inaccessible to others&#xA0;&#x2013; myself included.</p> <p>But enough was enough. I decided to learn UI design.</p> </section> <section> <p>Everyone&#x2019;s reasons for learning user interface design are different. If you&#x2019;re already a developer, a PM, a UX designer, etc., why develop this totally separate skill?</p> <p>Let&#x2019;s break it down:</p> <ul> <li><strong>UX Designers</strong>. You can present designs as beautiful mockups that your coworkers will rally around. You can work with interfaces from concept to pixel-perfection. Your portfolio stands light-years ahead of your peers.</li> <li><strong>Developers</strong>. You can cover for design on your team. You can spiff up your side-project&#x2019;s interface, instead of finding/hiring a designer. You can translate designs to code with minimal hassle, because you understand the aesthetic underpinnings.</li> <li><strong>PMs</strong>. You can create amazing mockups for pitching new features and flows. You can work alongside your designers, and provide spot-on feedback for excellent product.</li> <li><strong>Entrepreneurs</strong>. Like it or not, a good presentation for your ideas matters. Your marketing site, your app &#x2013; even your pitch deck. Eventually, you&apos;ll be in the big leagues and can hire out &#x2013; but even then, a solid foundation in design will help you communicate and lead.</li> <li><strong>Print Designers</strong>. More and more design work shifts to digital every day. You&apos;ve got to learn the ropes, figure out this whole &quot;responsive&quot; business, and practically re-build your portfolio to keep working in the field you love.</li> </ul> <p>For me, I had left my job to become a freelance UX designer, and my portfolio looked about as good as a Pentagon Powerpoint. Not to mention every one of my clients was asking: &#x201C;hey, now that you made these wireframes, can you do the <em>actual designs</em>?&#x201D; It was clear I could offer more to my clients if my end product wasn&#x2019;t sketched out boxes and arrows.</p> <p>So how do you learn UI design in 2019?</p> </section> <section> <p>One thing&#x2019;s for sure: paying full tuition for a multi-year degree in Graphic Design or Visual Communication makes <strong>zero sense</strong>.</p> <p>Let&#x2019;s add it up. That&#x2019;s tens of thousands of dollars for prerequisites, unrelated courses, and barely-applicable theory.</p> <p>Then, when you graduate, you&apos;d have $20,000+ in debt &#x2013; and <em>still</em> have to learn a bevy of new technologies, workflows, and skills.</p> <p>And when you get hired, you&apos;d have to learn just as much <strong>on the job</strong> as everyone else.</p> <p>Sadly, for me, there was <em>not</em> a great way to learn UI design. At least, not actual, pragmatic, finish-the-design-in-front-of-you UI skills. Now, a bunch of dev bootcamps are popping up &#x2013; and there are some for UX designers, with a lesson or two on aesthetics, but paltry pickings for the aspiring UI designer. Rough, right?</p> </section> <section> <p>When I learned UI design, I had to do it the hard way. Largely self-taught, making progress an inch at a time. In the end, I learned the aesthetics of apps the same way I&#x2019;ve learned any creative endeavor: cold, hard analysis. And shameless copying of what works. I&#x2019;ve worked 10 hours on a UI project and billed for 1. The other 9 were the wild flailing of learning.</p> <p>During those hours, I came to have a disdain for the theory-heavy blabbering that plagues so much design writing. You know the type? It&#x2019;s all about color theory, the golden ratio, grids, etc. &#x2013;&#xA0;and while it <em>seems</em> useful, it isn&#x2019;t clear how exactly it makes your design better. There was only one metric that mattered to me: <em>could this knowledge help me improve the design I was working on?</em></p> <p>Let&#x2019;s fast-forward a few years. Now, I&#x2019;ve designed interfaces for clients like <strong>Amazon, Soylent, and more</strong>, and made hundreds of thousands of dollars doing it. I&#x2019;ve <strong>circled the globe freelancing</strong> from a dozen countries. From enterprise systems to personal side-projects, I&#x2019;m confident in my ability to design whatever I need to &#x2013; and have it look <em>awesome</em>.</p> <p>&#x201C;But I don&#x2019;t know Arial from Helvetica&#x201D; you cry. How will you ever become confident in design?</p> <p>I thought you&#x2019;d never ask.</p> </section> <div class="blurb"> <p class="blurb__quote">Learn UI Design is an incredibly comprehensive course that will set you on a path to becoming a professional UI Designer.

In addition, I&apos;ve augmented the videos with screenshots of hundreds of the best interfaces for web and mobile. We&apos;ll talk about the very best of what&apos;s out there. But the focus is on opening up Sketch (or <a href="#faq-sketch">Figma</a>) and <em>doing it for ourselves</em>.</p> <p><strong>Think of it this way:</strong> I&apos;ve designed these videos to be like watching over my shoulder, as I share the tricks, tips, and frameworks that have helped me design UI every day for companies around the world.</p> <p>We&apos;re going to dive into and break down every major area of interface design.</p> <p>Which lesson are you going to do first?</p> </section> <div class="blurb"> <p class="blurb__quote">The color videos BLEW MY MIND!

My name is Erik Kennedy, and I&#x2019;m an independent UX + UI designer in beautiful Seattle, WA.</p> <p>My clients have ranged from startups to Fortune 100, and have included companies like Soylent, Amazon, and more.</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve spoken here and abroad at businesses, meetups, and universities (like UC Berkeley and Yale). In addition, my design writing has been read by over a million people.</p> <p>But before all that, I was in school for <em>engineering</em>. That&#x2019;s right &#x2013;&#xA0;a <em>developer</em>. So when I first tried my hand at design, I thought I was <em>doomed</em>.</p> <p>It looked awful.</p> <p>Of course, I had my excuses. <em>I didn&#x2019;t go to art school. I didn&#x2019;t know crap about aesthetics</em>.</p> <p class="wide-quote">I majored in engineering&#xA0;&#x2013;&#xA0;it&#x2019;s almost a badge of pride to build something that looks awful.</p> <p>However, the passion for design stuck. And I ended up teaching myself UI design the same way I&#x2019;ve learned anything: <em>cold, hard analysis</em>, like I said above.</p> <p>To cut it as a designer, I had to come up with tricks &amp; tactics I could apply to <em>whatever</em> app I was working on in the moment. I mixed those strategies with the best of what I could find scattered across a myriad of books and blog posts. </p> <p>And it worked. Here I am.</p> <p>Still kickin&#x2019;. Still designing.</p> <p>You&#x2019;ve read this far, so let&#x2019;s talk money. The simple fact is, companies pay for good UI design. They know they want to &#x201C;be like [Apple, AirBnB, insert company here]&#x201D;, but they don&#x2019;t know how. You can, though. It&#x2019;s a learnable set of skills, and it&#x2019;s valuable.</p> <p>Before being a freelance UX/UI Designer, I was a Program Manager at Microsoft, one of the highest-paying software companies in the nation. Two jobs. Where do you think I made more money?</p> <p>Know the answer? It ain&#x2019;t Microsoft.</p> <p>On top of that, my wife and I spent a year <em>literally</em> circling the globe on a trip we&#x2019;ll never forget. It was an amazing opportunity, but it was only possible because UI design is a hot commodity.</p> <p>(By the way, freelancing is not everyone&#x2019;s dream, but it is nice &#x2013; and if you choose to do it, you&#x2019;ll want to really dive into the video on <a href="#presenting">presenting your designs</a> &#x2013; it&#x2019;ll be pure gold for anyone who does client work)</p> <p>This sort of bragging is not something I&apos;d do to anyone I just met, but I&apos;m trying to sell a product, so cut me a bit of slack, eh? We&apos;ll keep moving along, but I want to hear you say it to yourself: <strong>people pay for good design</strong>.</p> </section> <p class="section--dark" id="personal-coaching"> <section> <p>If you need to learn UI design <strong>fast</strong>, there&#x2019;s no better way to do it than with personal advice and one-on-one design feedback.</p> <p>Some students come into Learn UI Design needing to focus on, say, typography. Others have a more intuitive sense of fonts, but would benefit from honing in on creating clearer hierarchies of content. It&#x2019;s different for everyone, which is why I&#x2019;m also offering the Personal coaching Plan.</p> <p>The <strong>Personal Coaching Plan</strong> is for students who need to up their skills <strong>as quickly and efficiently as possible</strong>.

Let me give you some examples, based on past sessions:</p> <ul> <li>&#x201C;Erik, here&#x2019;s a design I made. Can you <strong>review</strong> it and give me pointers on what to change or improve?&#x201D;</li> <li>&#x201C;Erik, will you <strong>watch me design</strong> and give me pointers as I go?&#x201D;</li> <li>&#x201C;Erik, here is a design problem.

I feel <em>much more confident</em> when approaching a new design project after going through the course!&#x201D;</p> <img src="img/testimonials/drazen-lucanin.png" alt="Dra&#x17E;en Lu&#x10D;anin" class="blurb__photo"> </div> <div class="blurb blurb--reverse"> <p class="blurb__quote">Learning from Erik, I was able to bring a cohesive style to my organization&#x2019;s enterprise application. Not only does it look WAY better, it&apos;s also more usable. I never thought design would be my thing, but I&apos;m 10x more confident with this stuff now. Highly recommended.&#x201D;</p> <img src="img/testimonials/aaron-marz.png" alt="Aaron Marz" class="blurb__photo"> </div> <div class="blurb"> <p class="blurb__quote">This course really helped develop my eye for UI design. I am much more able to identify needed improvements to a design, to communicate why they are important, and to quickly find relevant examples. My UI designs look much more professional than before.&#x201D;</p> <img src="img/testimonials/diane-rudeen.png" alt="Diane Rudeen" class="blurb__photo"> </div> <div class="blurb blurb--reverse"> <p class="blurb__quote">Learn UI Design is the best UI instruction I&apos;ve found.

It&apos;s like learning how to fly a plane by actually sitting in the cockpit with the pilot &#x2013; Erik is constantly designing/redesigning real-world examples right in front of you, explaining why X is good or bad, and how to go about making it even better.&#x201D;</p> <img src="img/testimonials/mudassir-ali.png" alt="Mudassir Ali" class="blurb__photo"> </div> <section id="enroll-now" class="is-closed"> <p>Want to be notified when Learn UI Design is re-opened for enrollments, and get original design articles sent to you every month (or 6)?
