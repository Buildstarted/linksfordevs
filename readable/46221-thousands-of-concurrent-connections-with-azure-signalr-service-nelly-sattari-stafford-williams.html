</p><p>As much as everyone loves having real-time applications, it is a pain to have them in high traffic websites. Scaling is a big issue which can be easily solved by using Azure&#x2019;s SignalR Service.</p> <p>How can we add real-time functionality to cloud hosted web applications? How can we test and handle high traffic volume without disrupting real-time capabilities? What new and interesting problems can we solve with a bi-directional-web feature-set?</p>
<p>Our speakers will explain, demonstrate and guide the audience through current ASP.NET Core SignalR technology and the possibilities that real-time features can give to modern web applications.<br>
They will also show how to use Serverless technology in the Azure cloud with Azure App Services, Azure Storage and Azure Functions to use SignalR APIs to build your Real-time web application.</p>
