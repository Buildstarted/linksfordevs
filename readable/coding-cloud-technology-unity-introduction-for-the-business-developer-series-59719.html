<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Welcome to this series of seven articles where we’ll be broadly introducing the topic of <em>Unity</em> (game engine).</p>

<ul>
<li>This series is aimed at existing .NET developers interested in learning a little about <em>Unity</em>

<ul>
<li>We’ll assume that you already have experience with developing software, the C# language and development tools such as Visual Studio.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This series is absolutely not intended to be a full-blown tutorial on how to learn <em>Unity</em> - that scope represents many full-sized books and tutorial courses.<br></li>
<li>The intent for this introductory-level series, is to provide a birds-eye view of various topics of interest - to help us better orientate ourselves.<br>

<ul>
<li>We’ll learn some of the semantics used.</li>
<li>We’ll look at some of the nuances related to the code that we need to write.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Later in the series, we’ll look at some small demo projects which should help to explain how <em>Unity</em> projects fit together.</li>
</ul>



<p>Often when faced with learning something entirely new, we don’t feel inclined to wade through an entire book aimed at beginners.  Instead, this series of articles is meant to be a curated list of ideas - hopefully they may provide a useful steer when learning a bunch of new concepts.</p>

<h2 id="unity-what-is-it">Unity - what is it?</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://unity.com/"><em>Unity</em></a> is a game engine used to create <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/2d">2D</a>, <a href="https://unity.com/how-to/difference-between-2D-and-3D-games">3D</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">VR</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">AR</a> graphic applications.<br></li>
<li><em>Unity</em> is available on both Mac and PC, with support for a <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/05/30/announcing-the-unity-editor-for-linux/">Linux version planned for 2020</a>.</li>
<li>Applications can be deployed to a large number of platforms and devices, including the desktop, gaming consoles and <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/mobile">mobile device</a>.</li>
<li><em>Unity</em> is not just used to create games, but is also used in industries such as <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/architecture-engineering-construction">engineering and architecture</a>.   For many years <em>Unity</em> has had a <a href="https://unity.com/our-company/newsroom/unity-announces-strategic-collaboration-microsoft">strong partnership with Microsoft</a>, which is why we find <em>Unity</em> associated with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/vr-ar-in-the-wild/">Microsoft AR research</a> and other projects using technology such <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hardware">HoloLens</a>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>This article was published in early 2020.  At the time of writing, it was applicable to the current latest version : Unity 2019.3.xxxx</p>

<h2 id="unity-how-best-to-install-it">Unity - how best to install it?</h2>

<p>Before we start, we will need to <a href="https://id.unity.com/">register a user account with <em>Unity</em></a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Unity</em> is free for personal use.<br></li>
<li>We can learn about <em>Unity</em> licensing options and costs at <a href="https://store.unity.com/compare-plans">Unity : Compare Plans</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If we’re familiar with using <em>Visual Studio</em> on Windows, there’s a good chance that we also use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019">Visual Studio Installer</a> to get updates and install additional components or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/modify-visual-studio?view=vs-2019"><em>workloads</em></a>.</p>

<p>In that tool, we may have seen <em>Unity</em> listed as a workload (see screenshot below)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This advice is only applicable for <em>Visual Studio For Windows</em> installer.  <em>Visual Studio For Mac</em> installer does not present an option to install the <em>Unity Editor</em> - just the tooling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://blogs.siliconorchid.com/images/newbie-coder/unity-intro-for-business-developer/pt1-intro/vsi-unity-option.png#shadow" alt="screenshot of Unity Hub"></p>



<ul>
<li><p>We <em>could</em> use the VS Installer to get the latest version of <em>Unity</em> - <strong>but I would steer people away from using this approach</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p>Instead, my recommendation is that we should download and use <em>Unity Hub</em> from the <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">Unity Download Page</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The reason for this advice is that <em>Unity Hub</em> makes it trivial to install and manage <strong>multiple concurrent versions of Unity</strong> and to associate different projects with these different versions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For users of VS for Mac, Rider, VSCode or any other code editor,  <em>Unity Hub</em> should be your default choice.</p>
</blockquote>



<ul>
<li><p><em>Unity</em> has a frequent release cadence:</p>

<ul>
<li>New versions become available every few weeks.<br></li>
<li>With most .NET projects, minor updates to the IDE have no impact on our codebase.
However, <em>Unity</em> projects need to be upgraded with each version update.  The upshot is that we need to take care to manage our versions, particularly if we are working in a team.  Be mindful not to get caught up in unnecessary updates.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><em>Unity</em> has a large installation:</p>

<ul>
<li>At time of writing, Unity 2019.3.xxx is about 6Gb without extras</li>
<li>The various <em>Build Support</em> options can add a couple of Gb each, as they comprise entire SDKs for their respective platform.</li>
<li>With this in mind, if we have a computer with multiple disks (e.g. an SSD system disk and a HDD storage disk) we may want to consider our installation destination thoughtfully.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>By default <em>Unity Hub</em> also attempts to install <em>Visual Studio</em>.   As an existing developer, we may already have this installed already, so <strong>make sure to deselect this option</strong> to avoid wasting time and/or installing duplicate instances.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="planning-to-follow-along-with-the-tutorials">Planning to follow along with the tutorials?</h3>

<p>In the following articles, we’re going to be building a basic mobile app - so if you’re planning to follow along with the examples, then preemptively, we should go ahead and kick-off the installation process now.</p>

<p>You should choose <strong>Android</strong> and/or <strong>IOS Build Support</strong> as well.   Specifically to Android, we should ensure the JDK &amp; SDK options are also selected by expanding the option. IOS support installs everything needed by default.</p>

<h2 id="unity-basic-terminology">Unity - Basic terminology.</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scene</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Think of a <em>Scene</em> as being a game-level - it comprises multiple objects that are typically (but not always) 3D models of some description.</li>
<li>In the editor, we define what is going to be included in the scene when it is first started.</li>
<li>In larger projects, a game/app will most likely be divided across multiple scenes.</li>
<li>If you have a background in web-development, it may help to think of a <em>Scene</em> as being a little bit like the  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">DOM</a>.  It has an initial state defined in the editor and can be changed during runtime by code.</li>
<li>We can read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingScenes.html">Unity Manual - Scenes</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>GameObject</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>GameObject</em> is the most fundamental basic object that represents “something” in the gameworld.</li>
<li>An instance of a <em>GameObject</em> always “exists” in the gameworld - it always has coordinates and a rotation.</li>
<li>A <em>GameObject</em> will normally have something called  <em>Components</em> associated with it.

<ul>
<li>Without any <em>Components</em> a <em>GameObject</em> doesn’t do anything.  In this respect it would be a bit like having an instance of a C# class without any methods or attributes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>One use for a <em>GameObject</em> without any components, could be a way to group other <em>GameObjects</em> together by representing a “parent container”.<br>

<ul>
<li>A group of <em>GameObjects</em> could be moved as one entity, by moving the parent, for example.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/class-GameObject.html">Unity Manual - GameObject</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Component</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>Component</em> encapsulates a set of properties and/or behaviour that can be assigned to a <em>GameObject</em><br></li>
<li>By adding a <em>Component</em> to  a <em>GameObject</em>, we can make that <em>GameObject</em> be or do something.

<ul>
<li>For example, it could become a camera, a light-source, a 3D shape, a UI button, or something that plays sounds.   It could be something that interacts with the physics engine, or perhaps used to emit a shower of particles.</li>
<li>There is a huge catalogue of <em>Components</em> available to us.<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <em>GameObject</em> can have multiple components assigned to it (for example, one <em>Component</em> could contain the definition of a Cube, whilst a second <em>Component</em> could add properties that enables the <em>GameObject</em> to interact with the physics engine.</li>
<li>We can associate other resources with the attributes of a component, by using drag+drop from within the Unity editor.</li>
<li>We can read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Components.html">Unity Documentation : Introduction to components
</a>  <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/Components.html">Unity Manual - Components</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Scripts</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>A script is a type of <em>Component</em> and provides a way for us to add properties and behaviour to a <em>GameObject</em></li>
<li>Scripts are written using C#.<br></li>
<li>A .NET solution (.sln) is created by <em>Unity</em> and forms part of the overall <em>Unity</em> project.<br></li>
<li>Scripts are recompiled by <em>Unity</em> every time we save changes - we can still rebuild our code independently within our IDE of choice, to provide compile-time information.</li>
<li><em>Unity</em> uses the cross-platform Mono implementation of .NET.<br>

<ul>
<li>We can read a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48614657/as-a-simple-unity-indie-dev-mono-and-net-still-confuse-me-who-is-who-who-do">beginner-friendly FAQ about Mono here</a>.<br></li>
<li>We cannot use <em>.NET Framework</em> libraries as these are not compatible with <em>Mono</em>, but we can use <em>.NET Standard v2.x</em> libraries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To support being a <em>Component</em>, a C# class must inherit from the <code>MonoBehaviour</code> base class (which itself sits atop a stack of other <code>UnityEngine</code> classes).</li>
<li>We’ll look at scripting more closely in the next article of this series <a href="https://blogs.siliconorchid.com/post/newbie-coder/unity-intro-for-business-developer/pt2-scripting/">Part 2 - Scripting</a></li>
<li>We can read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html">Unity Manual - Scripts</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Transform</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>Transform</em> is a type of <em>Component</em>.<br></li>
<li>At its simplest, a <em>Transform</em> component exposes information about a <em>GameObject’s</em> position and rotation.</li>
<li>It is unique within <em>Unity</em>, in that absolutely every <em>GameObject</em> will always have a <em>Transform Component</em> - so therefore, the two are intrinsically associated.</li>
<li>When scripting, we usually use the <em>Transform</em> when interacting with a <em>GameObject</em>, rather than the <em>GameObject</em> directly as you might expect.<br></li>
<li>We can read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html">Unity Manual - Transform</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Prefab</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>Prefab</em> is a <em>GameObject</em> - or more commonly,  a completed assembly of various GameObjects - that is intended to be reused.</li>
<li>For the business developer, there are some parallels to be made by thinking of a prefab as a class or model ready to be instantiated repeatedly.

<ul>
<li>For example, a video game may have an alien-character defined as an enemy - we would instantiate multiple copies of that <em>Prefab</em> in our game.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A prefab could be added to our <em>Scene</em> (thereby making an instanced copy) using the editor at design-time (dragging+dropping).  We can also create new instances of a prefab at runtime by using code in a script.<br></li>
<li>Any design-time instanced <em>Prefabs</em> in our <em>Scene</em> will appear with blue text and a blue icon by default.  Any one-off <em>GameObjects</em> in our <em>Scene</em> default to grey text).</li>
<li>We can read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html">Unity Manual - Prefab</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Asset</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>An <em>Asset</em> is anything that can be used by a <em>Unity</em> project.  It could be a 3D model, an image to be used as a texture or an audio file.</li>
<li>If we don’t have the experience or time to create <em>Assets</em> ourself, <em>Unity</em> provides an online marketplace - the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/">Unity Asset Store</a> - where we can purchase things like 3D models. We can then quickly include these in our own project.</li>
<li>Within the “Assets” folder of the project it is common practice to create subfolders with descriptive names to group together the different types of <em>Asset</em> - e.g. “scripts”, “scenes”, “prefabs”, “materials” etc.</li>
<li>We can read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/AssetWorkflow.html">Unity Manual - Prefab</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Material</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you play video games, you most likely have some appreciation about how 3D graphics work.<br></li>
<li>A <em>Unity Material</em> is a way to define how something should be rendered visually by the game engine.<br>

<ul>
<li>At its simplest, this could be just a flat color.<br></li>
<li>More commonly we could use an image as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping">texture which is mapped</a> onto a 3D object.<br></li>
<li>A material can be a layered combination of several other effects - such as “how reflective”, “how shiny”, “does it have a bump-map for additional 3D effects” etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Materials.html">Unity Manual - Creating and Using Materials</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Packages</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We can extend the functionality of <em>Unity</em> by including additional <em>Packages</em>.   A package comprises a collection of <em>Assets</em>, typically including <em>Scripts</em> and any other resources needed to serve a purpose.</li>
<li>As a .NET developer there are parallels with NuGet packages - notably in that packages are versioned - but here the package contains more than just code (it is normally a collection of <em>Assets</em></li>
<li>We can manage the range of <em>Unity</em>-curated packages by using the top menu:  Window → Package Manager.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="first-look-at-the-unity-editor">First look at the Unity Editor</h2>

<p>As with any complicated software, the <em>Unity Editor</em> can seem daunting on first acquaintance.</p>

<p>The editor can be broken down into a handful of main panels, so let’s break things down with a really high-level explanation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Throughout this series, we will be referring to these sections by their name, time-after-time - so refer back here if you lose your way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://blogs.siliconorchid.com/images/newbie-coder/unity-intro-for-business-developer/pt1-intro/overview-of-unity-editor.jpg#shadow" alt="screenshot of Unity editor with annotations"></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Scene View</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This is our visual portal into the game world.<br></li>
<li>We can manipulate our view of the game world using the mouse (or trackpad):

<ul>
<li>hold down the right-button to rotate our view</li>
<li>use the scroll-wheel (or trackpad pinch) to zoom in and out.</li>
<li>Ideally we want to use a mouse with three buttons, as the middle-button is used to pan the view about.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can switch between 3D and 2D - there is a small button along the top of the panel to toggle.

<ul>
<li>Even in a 3D app, the 2D view is useful if we are working with things such as UI controls.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html">Unity Manual - Scene View Navigation</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Hierarchy View</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Earlier, we established that a scene is comprised of <em>GameObjects</em>.   The hierarchy panel displays a tree-structure of design-time objects, showing us the parent-child relationship.</li>
<li>We can create new assets by:

<ul>
<li>using the <em>Unity Editor’s</em> context-menus (e.g. right-click → 3D Object → Cube), or by,</li>
<li>dragging and dropping an existing asset, from the project files and into the hierarchy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can highlight a <em>GameObject</em> to select it for “Inspection” in the <em>Inspection View</em></li>
<li>We can do things such as dragging+dropping objects around the Hierarchy if we need to.</li>
<li>Read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html">Unity Manual - Hierarchy View</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Project View</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>Project View</em> is a type of file-explorer and is used to display the various files and folders that make up our project.<br>

<ul>
<li>By default we can expect to see a folder for “Assets” showing here.<br></li>
<li>If we have additional <em>Packages</em> installed, we’ll see them showing in the “Packages” folder.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The view includes a panel for previewing <em>Assets</em> (if possible - i.e. this works for a texture, but not an audio file).<br>

<ul>
<li>A useful tip is that we can change the size of the preview items by adjusting the smaller slider-control in the bottom-right of the panel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html">Unity Manual - Project View</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Inspector View</strong> (Component Inspector)</p>

<ul>
<li>When we select a <em>GameObject</em> in the <em>Hierarchy View</em>, the corresponding <em>Components</em>, along with all of their details, are listed.</li>
<li>Using the “Add Component” button, we can search for additional components, that can be added to the <em>GameObject</em>.<br></li>
<li>Many <em>Components</em> have attributes that are visible in the <em>Unity Editor</em>.    Different types of attributes can be edited in different ways. For example:

<ul>
<li>An attribute that was expecting a number, could display a text box for you to enter a number.</li>
<li>An attribute that was expecting a colour, could display an option for selecting a colour from a color-picker tool.</li>
<li>An attribute that is a reference to a <em>Prefab</em>, lets us drag+drop a <em>Prefab</em> directly onto the attribute box .<br></li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="miscellaneous-things-that-are-worth-knowing-about">Miscellaneous things that are worth knowing about</h2>

<h3 id="the-unity-editor-does-not-periodically-autosave">The Unity Editor does not periodically autosave</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>You need to get in the habit of remembering to manually save frequently.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A crash can lose our work, which is super-frustrating.<br></li>
<li>It’s a subject that has been <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/we-need-auto-save-feature.483853/">discussed in forums</a>.    Apparently there are 3rd party plugins to address this, but I have not experimented with them.
<br></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>In the “File” menu, <em>Unity</em> has two separate save options:  “Save” and “Save Project”.  It’s not immediately obvious what the distinction is, so briefly:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Save” saves both the <em>Scene</em> and the Project together.  Changes to a scene include adding/removing <em>GameObjects</em> and the details of any <em>Component</em> in the <em>Inspector</em>.   <strong>I would just always use the vanilla “Save” option (Ctrl+S).</strong></li>
<li>“Save Project” saves changes to only the project-specific settings (e.g. things in the Edit → Edit Project Settings dialogue, and things like the “Build Settings”  (File → Build Settings)</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Saving.html">Unity Manual - Saving</a></p></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="ide-code-editor-integration">IDE / Code-Editor Integration</h3>

<ul>
<li>Some code-editing environments need an extension to fully integrate with <em>Unity</em>.<br></li>
<li>We’ll look at this subject more closely later in this series <a href="https://blogs.siliconorchid.com/post/newbie-coder/unity-intro-for-business-developer/pt4-debugger-logging/">Part 4 Logging and debugging</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="changes-we-make-in-play-mode-are-not-retained">Changes we make in “Play mode” are not retained.</h3>

<ul>
<li>To test and run our project, we use play mode (the prominent play/stop icon in the top centre of the screen).</li>
<li>Play mode still lets us edit settings and parameters.   This is by design, so we can experiment with settings whilst our game/app is running.<br>

<ul>
<li>It is not always obvious that we are actually currently in play mode, meaning that we can inadvertently be making changes that will end up being wasted.</li>
<li>We can edit a preference in the Unity Editor, so that it changes colour so as to more dramatically obvious that we are currently in play mode.  We can do this by changing:   Edit → Preferences → Colors → Playmode Tint, I would recommend doing this!</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="unity-uses-something-called-quaternions-for-angles-rotations">Unity uses something called “Quaternions” for angles/rotations</h3>

<p>It won’t take long for us to come across the word “Quaternion” … and being left wondering what on earth this is all about!</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of us are familiar with the idea of the 360 degree angle:<br>

<ul>
<li>If we combine three of these angles together, we can describe the rotation of an object in 3D space.</li>
<li>The technical name for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles">“Euler Angles”</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A problem with using Euler Angles is that they can be subject to something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock">“Gimbal Lock”</a>.<br>

<ul>
<li>A very, very crude explanation is that in certain circumstances, we could try to modify an angle and nothing would  appear to happen.<br></li>
<li>I would recommend watching this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc8b2Jo7mno">YouTube: Euler (gimbal lock) Explained
</a> that explains it properly - it’s something we need to visualise, rather than read about!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Because of the limitation of using Euler Angles, instead, <em>Unity</em> internally uses a system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion">“Quaternions”</a> to describe angles and rotations.<br>

<ul>
<li>These happen to be comprised of four values (x, y, z, w), but these don’t equate to our regular concept of axis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For the purpose of this article, we don’t need to get embroiled in the topic.  Suffice to say:

<ul>
<li>we should not attempt to modify the values of a quaternion angle manually by reading or modifying its properties.</li>
<li>instead,  we should use <em>Unity</em> classes and methods to work with them.  For example <code>Quaternion.LookRotation</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read more at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/QuaternionAndEulerRotationsInUnity.html">Unity Documentation - Rotation and Orientation in Unity</a></li>
</ul>
