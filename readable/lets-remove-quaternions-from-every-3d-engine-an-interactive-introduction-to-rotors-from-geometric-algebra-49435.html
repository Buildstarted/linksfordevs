<blockquote><i>I am sold. While I can understand quaternions to an extent, this way of thinking is a much more intuitive and elegant approach.</i> <span>—Jack Rasksilver</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>This sets a high standard for educational material, and is a shining example of how we can improve education with today's technologies.</i> <span>—Sebastien Pierre</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>When I was in college, I asked one of my math professors why the cross product of two vectors results in a perpendicular vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors. Like..what? Why? And what about 2D?

They blew me off, and that was a big part of why I stopped taking math in college. [...]

Anyway, I had pretty much given up on ever truly understanding the whole jumble of seemingly unrelated types that are cross products. But then I saw this: And...wow. Just 15 minutes and a lot more than just cross products suddenly make a lot more sense.</i> <span>—Mason Remaley</span></blockquote>

<p>To represent 3D rotations graphics programmers use <i>Quaternions</i>. However, <strong>Quaternions are taught at face value</strong>. We just accept their odd multiplication tables and other arcane definitions and use them as black boxes that rotate vectors in the ways we want. Why does <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1"><span id="MJXp-Span-2"><span id="MJXp-Span-3"><span id="MJXp-Span-4">i</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-5">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-6">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-7"><span id="MJXp-Span-8"><span id="MJXp-Span-9">j</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-10">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-11">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-12"><span id="MJXp-Span-13"><span id="MJXp-Span-14">k</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-15">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-16">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-17">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-18">1</span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-19"><span id="MJXp-Span-20"><span id="MJXp-Span-21">i</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-22"><span id="MJXp-Span-23">j</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-24">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-25"><span id="MJXp-Span-26">k</span></span></span></span>? Why do we take a vector and upgrade it to an "imaginary" vector in order to transform it, like <span><span id="MJXp-Span-27"><span id="MJXp-Span-28"><span id="MJXp-Span-29">q</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-30">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-31">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-32"><span id="MJXp-Span-33">i</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-34">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-35">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-36"><span id="MJXp-Span-37">j</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-38">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-39">z</span><span id="MJXp-Span-40"><span id="MJXp-Span-41">k</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-42">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-43"><span id="MJXp-Span-44"><span id="MJXp-Span-45">q</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-46"><span id="MJXp-Span-47">∗</span></span></span></span></span>? Who cares as long as it rotates vectors the right way, right?</p>

<p>Personally, I have always found it <strong>important to actually understand the things I am using</strong>. I remember learning about Cross Products and Quaternions and being confused about why they worked this way, but nobody talked about it. Later on I learned about <i>Geometric Algebra</i> and suddenly I could see that the questions I had were legitimate, and everything became so much clearer.</p>

<p>In Geometric Algebra there is a way to represent rotations called a <i>Rotor</i> that <strong>generalizes</strong> Quaternions (in 3D) and Complex Numbers (in 2D) and even works in any number of dimensions. </p>

<p>3D Rotors are in a sense <strong>the true form</strong> of quaternions, or in other words Quaternions are an <strong>obfuscated</strong> version of Rotors. They are equivalent in that:</p><ul><li>they have the same number of components,</li><li>their API is the same,</li><li>they are as efficient,</li><li>they are good for interpolation and avoiding gimbal lock, etc...</li><li>in fact, they are isomorphic,</li></ul><p> so it is possible to do some math to turn a rotor into a quaternion, <strong>but doing so makes them less general and less intuitive</strong> (and loses extra capabilites). </p>

<p>But instead of defining Quaternions out of nowhere and trying to explain how they work <strong>retroactively</strong>, it is possible to explain Rotors <strong>almost entirely from scratch</strong>. This obviously takes more time, but I find it is very much worth it because it makes them much easier to understand!</p> 

<p><img src="https://marctenbosch.com/quaternions/planets.png" alt="Earth-Centric planetary motion"></p><p>For example, Quaternions are introduced as this mysterious four-dimensional object, but why introduce a fourth dimension of space to visualize a 3D concept? By contrast 3D Rotors do not require the use of a fourth dimension of space in order to be visualized.</p>

<p>Trying to visualize quaternions as operating in 4D just to explain 3D rotations is a bit like trying to understand planetary motion from an earth-centric perspective i.e. overly complex because you are looking at it from the wrong viewpoint.</p>

<p>It would be great if we could start phasing out the use and teaching of Quaternions and replace them with Rotors. The change is simple and <strong>the <a href="https://marctenbosch.com/quaternions/code.htm">code</a> remains almost the same, but the understanding grows a lot.</strong> </p>

<p>As a side note, Geometric Algebra contains more than just Rotors, and is a very useful tool to have in one's toolbox. This article also serves as an introduction to it.</p>

<h2>Planes of Rotations<a name="h_1"></a></h2>

<h3>Rotations happen in 2D planes </h3>

<p>In 3D, we usually think of rotations as happening around an axis, like a wheel turning around its axle, but instead of thinking about the axle a more correct way is to think about the plane that the wheel lies on, perpendicular to the axle. </p>

<img src="https://marctenbosch.com/quaternions/oldlady.png" alt="Old Lady shows off rotations">
<p>This old lady is spinning wheel in the <span><span id="MJXp-Span-48"><span id="MJXp-Span-49"><span id="MJXp-Span-50">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-51">z</span></span></span></span> plane, perpendicular to the <span><span id="MJXp-Span-52"><span id="MJXp-Span-53"><span id="MJXp-Span-54">y</span></span></span></span> axis.</p>

<p>This is because if we split a vector into two pieces, one lying inside the plane (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-55"><span id="MJXp-Span-56"><span id="MJXp-Span-57"><span id="MJXp-Span-58">v</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-59">∥</span></span></span></span>) and one lying outside the plane (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-60"><span id="MJXp-Span-61"><span id="MJXp-Span-62"><span id="MJXp-Span-63">v</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-64">⊥</span></span></span></span>), the rotation rotates the inside part while keeping the outside part the same.</p>


<p>Rotation in the <span><span id="MJXp-Span-65"><span id="MJXp-Span-66">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-67">x</span></span></span> plane [<strong>Drag anywhere to move the camera</strong>]</p>

<p>In 2D there is only one single plane to rotate in (there is <strong>no outside part</strong>). Therefore considering rotations to happen around a third axis (perpendicular to the 2D plane) is technically incorrect, since we shouldn't need to introduce another dimension to perform rotations.</p>

<p>If you told a 2D "flatlander" (who lives inside a 2D plane and has only ever experienced 2D) about a perpendicular rotation axis they would look at you and ask "which direction does the axis point along? I can't picture it!"</p>

<p>[Aside] And in higher dimensions (4D and more) it is impossible to define a single normal vector to a 2D plane (for example in 4D there are two normal directions to a 2D plane, in 5D there are three normals directions, and in <span><span id="MJXp-Span-68"><span id="MJXp-Span-69">n</span></span></span>D there are <span><span id="MJXp-Span-70"><span id="MJXp-Span-71">n</span><span id="MJXp-Span-72">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-73">2</span></span></span>)</p>

<h3>Explicit Sense of Rotation </h3>

<p>In addition, when thinking about rotation around an axis, the sense of the rotation is undefined, and so needs to be defined by convention (via the so-called "right hand rule").</p>

<p>However, if we think about rotations as happening inside planes, the sense is clear: rotation in the <span><span id="MJXp-Span-74"><span id="MJXp-Span-75"><span id="MJXp-Span-76">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-77">y</span></span></span></span> plane means a rotation that takes the (unit) vector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-78"><span id="MJXp-Span-79"><span id="MJXp-Span-80">x</span></span></span></span> to the (unit) vector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-81"><span id="MJXp-Span-82"><span id="MJXp-Span-83">y</span></span></span></span>, inside the plane they form together. Rotation in the <span><span id="MJXp-Span-84"><span id="MJXp-Span-85"><span id="MJXp-Span-86">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-87">x</span></span></span></span> plane is the opposite rotation: it takes the vector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-88"><span id="MJXp-Span-89"><span id="MJXp-Span-90">y</span></span></span></span> to the vector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-91"><span id="MJXp-Span-92"><span id="MJXp-Span-93">x</span></span></span></span>. </p>

<div>

<p>[Aside] When I first learned about the three 3D rotation matrices along orthogonal planes, I remember thinking, why the hell does the <span><span id="MJXp-Span-94"><span id="MJXp-Span-95"><span id="MJXp-Span-96"><span id="MJXp-Span-97">R</span><span id="MJXp-Span-98">y</span></span></span></span></span> matrix have the opposite sign? It's because of the "right hand rule", where we must define rotation around the <span><span id="MJXp-Span-99"><span id="MJXp-Span-100"><span id="MJXp-Span-101">y</span></span></span></span> axis to be from <span><span id="MJXp-Span-102"><span id="MJXp-Span-103"><span id="MJXp-Span-104">z</span></span></span></span> to <span><span id="MJXp-Span-105"><span id="MJXp-Span-106"><span id="MJXp-Span-107">x</span></span></span></span> instead of <span><span id="MJXp-Span-108"><span id="MJXp-Span-109"><span id="MJXp-Span-110">x</span></span></span></span> to <span><span id="MJXp-Span-111"><span id="MJXp-Span-112"><span id="MJXp-Span-113">z</span></span></span></span> to maintain a consistent right-handed sense of rotation. That convention becomes unnecessary when we talk directly about the plane itself.</p>



</div>


<h2>Bivectors<a name="h_3"></a></h2>



<h3>The Outer Product </h3>

<p>To compute the axis of rotation to rotate one vector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-286"><span id="MJXp-Span-287"><span id="MJXp-Span-288">a</span></span></span></span> to another vector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-289"><span id="MJXp-Span-290"><span id="MJXp-Span-291">b</span></span></span></span>, we take the cross product of the two vectors to get a vector that is perpendicular to both. But why "leave" the plane, since a rotation is fundamentally a 2D thing?</p>

<p>Instead we take what is called the <strong>outer product</strong> (also called exterior, or wedge product) of the two vectors, building a new element called a bivector (or 2-vector) <span><span id="MJXp-Span-292"><span id="MJXp-Span-293"><span id="MJXp-Span-294">B</span></span></span></span> that represents the plane the two vectors form together. If the cross product creates the <strong>normal vector</strong> to a plane, the outer product creates the <strong>plane itself</strong>. Taking the normal to the plane is extraneous.</p>

<p><span><span id="MJXp-Span-295"><span id="MJXp-Span-296"><span id="MJXp-Span-297">B</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-298">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-299"><span id="MJXp-Span-300">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-301">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-302"><span id="MJXp-Span-303">b</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span id="MJXp-Span-304"><span id="MJXp-Span-305"><span id="MJXp-Span-306">B</span></span></span></span> can be represented as the parallelogram built from the vectors <span><span id="MJXp-Span-307"><span id="MJXp-Span-308"><span id="MJXp-Span-309">a</span></span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-310"><span id="MJXp-Span-311"><span id="MJXp-Span-312">b</span></span></span></span>, in the plane they form together.</p>

<p>The idea of a bivector might seem a bit strange at first, but they are pretty much <strong>as fundamental as vectors</strong>, as we will see. If a vector is like a line, then a bivector is like a plane... The properties of the outer product are suited to capture the properties of planes.</p>

<h3>Basis for Bivectors </h3>



<p>Bivectors have components, just like vectors. But they are defined in terms of basis <strong>planes</strong> instead of basis <strong>lines</strong> like vectors.</p>

<p>The three orthogonal basis planes are <span><span id="MJXp-Span-313"><span id="MJXp-Span-314"><span id="MJXp-Span-315">x</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-316">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-317"><span id="MJXp-Span-318">y</span></span></span></span>, <span><span id="MJXp-Span-319"><span id="MJXp-Span-320"><span id="MJXp-Span-321">x</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-322">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-323"><span id="MJXp-Span-324">z</span></span></span></span>, and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-325"><span id="MJXp-Span-326"><span id="MJXp-Span-327">y</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-328">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-329"><span id="MJXp-Span-330">z</span></span></span></span>, as seen on the diagram to the right.</p>

<p>But first let's look at the simpler 2D case...</p>

<br>

<h3>2D Bivectors </h3>

<p>In 2D there is only one plane, the <span><span id="MJXp-Span-331"><span id="MJXp-Span-332"><span id="MJXp-Span-333">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-334">y</span></span></span></span> plane. So a 2D bivector only has one component. For a bivector built from vectors <span><span id="MJXp-Span-335"><span id="MJXp-Span-336"><span id="MJXp-Span-337">a</span></span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-338"><span id="MJXp-Span-339"><span id="MJXp-Span-340">b</span></span></span></span>, this number <span><span id="MJXp-Span-341"><span id="MJXp-Span-342"><span id="MJXp-Span-343">B</span><span id="MJXp-Span-344"><span id="MJXp-Span-345">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-346">y</span></span></span></span></span> is equal to the (signed) area of the parallelogram the two vectors form together. 

</p><p><span><span id="MJXp-Span-347"><span id="MJXp-Span-348"><span id="MJXp-Span-349">B</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-350">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-351"><span id="MJXp-Span-352">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-353">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-354"><span id="MJXp-Span-355">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-356">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-357"><span id="MJXp-Span-358">B</span><span id="MJXp-Span-359"><span id="MJXp-Span-360">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-361">y</span></span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-362">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-363"><span id="MJXp-Span-364">x</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-365">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-366"><span id="MJXp-Span-367">y</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-368">)</span></span></span></p>

You can play with a 2D bivector in the following interactive diagram, by adjusting the (unit) vectors it is made from:



<p>You can see that by changing the angle between the vectors the area of the parallelogram changes (according to the sine of the angle). </p>

<p>If the vectors are the same, or if they are parallel, they don't form a proper plane and the result is zero. This simple property defines what a bivector is:</p>

<p><span><span id="MJXp-Span-369"><span id="MJXp-Span-370"><span id="MJXp-Span-371">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-372">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-373"><span id="MJXp-Span-374">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-375">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-376">0</span></span></span></p>

<p>By looking at the sum of two vectors, we can see that this property implies the following:</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<p><span><span id="MJXp-Span-449"><span id="MJXp-Span-450"><span id="MJXp-Span-451">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-452">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-453"><span id="MJXp-Span-454">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-455">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-456">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-457"><span id="MJXp-Span-458">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-459">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-460"><span id="MJXp-Span-461">a</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Just like the <strong>sense of a rotation</strong> matters, the order of the arguments to the outer product matters. Swapping the arguments changes the sign of the result (this is called "anti-symmetric").</p>


<p>In the diagram, the sign is represented using the color, which changes from blue to green. The sign changes whenever the rotation from <span><span id="MJXp-Span-462"><span id="MJXp-Span-463"><span id="MJXp-Span-464">a</span></span></span></span> to <span><span id="MJXp-Span-465"><span id="MJXp-Span-466"><span id="MJXp-Span-467">b</span></span></span></span> goes from being clockwise to being anticlockwise (i.e. if it matches the (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-468"><span id="MJXp-Span-469"><span id="MJXp-Span-470">x</span></span></span></span> to <span><span id="MJXp-Span-471"><span id="MJXp-Span-472"><span id="MJXp-Span-473">y</span></span></span></span>) direction or the (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-474"><span id="MJXp-Span-475"><span id="MJXp-Span-476">y</span></span></span></span> to <span><span id="MJXp-Span-477"><span id="MJXp-Span-478"><span id="MJXp-Span-479">x</span></span></span></span>) direction).</p>

<p>You can see how the properties of the outer product are suited to capture the properties of planes and rotations.</p>

<h3>2D Bivectors from non-unit vectors </h3>

<p>The vectors obviously don't have to be unit lengths, and in this diagram the restriction is removed:</p>



<p>The signed area of the parallelogram is proportional to the lengths of both vectors: <span><span id="MJXp-Span-494"><span id="MJXp-Span-495"><span id="MJXp-Span-496">B</span><span id="MJXp-Span-497"><span id="MJXp-Span-498">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-499">y</span></span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-500">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-501">s</span><span id="MJXp-Span-502">i</span><span id="MJXp-Span-503">n</span><span id="MJXp-Span-504">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-505">α</span><span id="MJXp-Span-506">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-507">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-508">a</span><span id="MJXp-Span-509">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-510">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-511">b</span><span id="MJXp-Span-512">‖</span></span></span> where <span><span id="MJXp-Span-513"><span id="MJXp-Span-514">α</span></span></span> is the angle between <span><span id="MJXp-Span-515"><span id="MJXp-Span-516"><span id="MJXp-Span-517">a</span></span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-518"><span id="MJXp-Span-519"><span id="MJXp-Span-520">b</span></span></span></span>. So for example doubling the length of one vector doubles the area.</p>

<p>We can get the actual value by plugging in the vectors in component form:</p>

<h3>3D Bivectors </h3>



<p>Just like the coordinates of a vector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-738"><span id="MJXp-Span-739"><span id="MJXp-Span-740">v</span></span></span></span> can be thought of as the <strong>projections</strong> of the vector onto the three orthogonal basis axes (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-741"><span id="MJXp-Span-742"><span id="MJXp-Span-743">x</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-744">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-745"><span id="MJXp-Span-746">y</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-747">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-748"><span id="MJXp-Span-749">z</span></span></span></span>), the coordinates of a bivector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-750"><span id="MJXp-Span-751"><span id="MJXp-Span-752">B</span></span></span></span> can be thought of as the <strong>projections</strong> of the small plane onto the three orthogonal basis planes.</p>

<p>The projections of the vector are the <strong>lengths</strong> of that vector along each basis vector, while the projections of the bivector are the <strong>areas</strong>  of the plane on each basis plane.</p>

<p>The components of a 3D bivector are just the three 2D projections of the bivector onto the 2D basis planes.</p>

<p>Using the same method as before we find that the actual values of the components look a lot like the XY component from the 2D case, but applied to all three planes:</p>

<p>You can play with a 3D bivector in the following interactive diagram:</p>



<!-- div class="expandable">
<p>[Aside] The norm of the bivector $\|\mathbf{B}\|=\|\mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b}\|$ is defined similarly to that of a vector (square root of the sum of the components squared). It is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ i.e. $\|\mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b}\|= \mid sin(\alpha)\mid\|\mathbf{a}\|\|\mathbf{b}\|$ where $\alpha$ is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. </p>

<p>If we divide the bivector by its norm we cancel out the two lengths of the vectors and the (absolute value of the) sine of the angle, so we are left with the bivector $\hat{\mathbf{B}}$ that would have been built if the two vectors were originally perpendicular and unit lengths. This is a very pure representation of the plane containing both vectors. Then:</p>

<p class="bcenter">$$\mathbf{B} = |\mathbf{a}\|\|\mathbf{b}\| \mid sin(\alpha) \mid \hat{\mathbf{B}}$$</p>

</div -->

<p>Does the exterior product remind you of anything? In 3D, the definition of the outer product is very similar to that of the cross product. In fact, in 3D a vector that comes from a cross product (such as a normal vector) will have three components which are equal to the components of the bivector (the numbers are the same, but the basis is different).</p>

 <p>[Aside] I chose a lexicographic order for the basis because it is easy to remember, but choosing <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1100"><span id="MJXp-Span-1101"><span id="MJXp-Span-1102">z</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1103">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1104"><span id="MJXp-Span-1105">x</span></span></span></span> instead of <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1106"><span id="MJXp-Span-1107"><span id="MJXp-Span-1108">x</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1109">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1110"><span id="MJXp-Span-1111">z</span></span></span></span> would make the signs the same. It would also makes the <a href="#h_4">bivector basis</a> directions consistent. This is the right hand rule, except the understandable non-arbitrary version :)</p>

<p><strong>The bivector definition makes sense geometrically, instead of appearing out of thin air.</strong> I remember thinking when I was learning the cross product, why the hell does it return a vector that has length equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors? That feels so arbitrary. And why would you be allowed to turn the <strong>area</strong> of the parallelogram into the <strong>length</strong> of the vector?</p>





<h3>Semantics of Vectors and Bivectors </h3>

<p>In 3D, a bivector has three coordinates, one per plane: (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1112"><span id="MJXp-Span-1113"><span id="MJXp-Span-1114">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1115">y</span></span></span></span>, <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1116"><span id="MJXp-Span-1117"><span id="MJXp-Span-1118">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1119">z</span></span></span></span>, and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1120"><span id="MJXp-Span-1121"><span id="MJXp-Span-1122">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1123">z</span></span></span></span>). Vectors also have three coordinates, one per axis (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1124"><span id="MJXp-Span-1125"><span id="MJXp-Span-1126">x</span></span></span></span>, <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1127"><span id="MJXp-Span-1128"><span id="MJXp-Span-1129">y</span></span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1130"><span id="MJXp-Span-1131"><span id="MJXp-Span-1132">z</span></span></span></span>). Each plane is perpendicular to one axis. This is a coincidence that only happens in three dimensions <strong>(*)</strong> and it is why <strong>historically we have been confusing bivectors with vectors</strong>.</p>

<p>[Aside] <strong>(*)</strong> In 2D there is only one basis bivector (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1133"><span id="MJXp-Span-1134"><span id="MJXp-Span-1135">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1136">y</span></span></span></span>), in 3D there are 3 basis bivectors (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1137"><span id="MJXp-Span-1138"><span id="MJXp-Span-1139">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1140">y</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1141">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1142"><span id="MJXp-Span-1143">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1144">z</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1145">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1146"><span id="MJXp-Span-1147">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1148">z</span></span></span></span>), in 4D there are 6 basis bivectors (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1149"><span id="MJXp-Span-1150"><span id="MJXp-Span-1151">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1152">y</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1153">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1154"><span id="MJXp-Span-1155">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1156">z</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1157">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1158"><span id="MJXp-Span-1159">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1160">w</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1161">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1162"><span id="MJXp-Span-1163">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1164">z</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1165">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1166"><span id="MJXp-Span-1167">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1168">w</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1169">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1170"><span id="MJXp-Span-1171">z</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1172">w</span></span></span></span>), etc...</p>

<p>In programming terms, they both have the same memory layout, but different operations. Using a 3D vector instead of a 3D bivector is like "type-casting" the bivector.</p>

<p>Here's an example: you might have seen how normal vectors transform differently than regular vectors, using the "inverse transpose" of the matrix <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1173"><span id="MJXp-Span-1174">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1175"><span id="MJXp-Span-1176"><span id="MJXp-Span-1177">M</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1178"><span id="MJXp-Span-1179">T</span></span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1180"><span id="MJXp-Span-1181">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1182"><span id="MJXp-Span-1183">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1184">1</span></span></span></span></span> instead of the matrix itself. That's because they are not really vectors, but actually bivectors, which we have "type-cast" to vectors. In physics, there's a hack called an "axial vector," which has been introduced to differentiate vectors that come from cross products from regular vectors. Bivector is the actual "type" of the object and it should be thought of and manipulated as such.</p>

<h3>[Aside] Trivectors </h3>



<p>We can keep taking the outer product to build not just oriented 2D areas, but oriented 3D volumes as well. A trivector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1185"><span id="MJXp-Span-1186">T</span></span></span> can be built by taking the outer product twice:</p>

<h2>The Geometric Product<a name="h_10"></a></h2>

<h3>Multiplying Vectors together </h3>

The geometric product <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1261"><span id="MJXp-Span-1262"><span id="MJXp-Span-1263">a</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1264">b</span></span></span></span> (denoted without a symbol) is another operation one can do on vectors. The geometric product is defined so that vectors have inverses (i.e <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1265"><span id="MJXp-Span-1266"><span id="MJXp-Span-1267">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1268"><span id="MJXp-Span-1269"><span id="MJXp-Span-1270">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1271"><span id="MJXp-Span-1272">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1273">1</span></span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1274">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1275">1</span></span></span> where 1 is just the number <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1276"><span id="MJXp-Span-1277">1</span></span></span>!) and have nice properties like associativity (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1278"><span id="MJXp-Span-1279"><span id="MJXp-Span-1280">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1281">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1282"><span id="MJXp-Span-1283">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1284"><span id="MJXp-Span-1285">c</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1286">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1287">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1288">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1289"><span id="MJXp-Span-1290">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1291"><span id="MJXp-Span-1292">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1293">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1294"><span id="MJXp-Span-1295">c</span></span></span></span>). The goal is to be able to multiply vectors together so that —just like for matrices—  multiplication corresponds to geometric operations.

<p>The first term does not depend on the order of the arguments <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1378"><span id="MJXp-Span-1379"><span id="MJXp-Span-1380">a</span></span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1381"><span id="MJXp-Span-1382"><span id="MJXp-Span-1383">b</span></span></span></span> anymore (it is called the "symmetric" part), while the second term changes sign when the arguments are swapped (it is called the "antisymmetric" part). </p>

<p>The dot product of two vectors (also called inner product) is symmetric and is a measure of distance (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1384"><span id="MJXp-Span-1385"><span id="MJXp-Span-1386">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1387">⋅</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1388"><span id="MJXp-Span-1389">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1390">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1391">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1392"><span id="MJXp-Span-1393">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1394"><span id="MJXp-Span-1395">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1396">2</span></span></span></span>), so it sounds useful geometrically to set it equal to the symmetric part:</p>

<p><span><span id="MJXp-Span-1397"><span id="MJXp-Span-1398"><span><span id="MJXp-Span-1399">1</span></span><span><span><span><span></span></span><span><span><span id="MJXp-Span-1400">2</span></span></span></span></span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1401">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1402"><span id="MJXp-Span-1403">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1404"><span id="MJXp-Span-1405">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1406">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1407"><span id="MJXp-Span-1408">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1409"><span id="MJXp-Span-1410">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1411">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1412">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1413"><span id="MJXp-Span-1414">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1415">⋅</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1416"><span id="MJXp-Span-1417">b</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Similarity, the outer product of two vectors is antisymmetric, so it sounds useful geometrically to set it equal to the antisymmetric part:</p>

<p><span><span id="MJXp-Span-1418"><span id="MJXp-Span-1419"><span><span id="MJXp-Span-1420">1</span></span><span><span><span><span></span></span><span><span><span id="MJXp-Span-1421">2</span></span></span></span></span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1422">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1423"><span id="MJXp-Span-1424">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1425"><span id="MJXp-Span-1426">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1427">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1428"><span id="MJXp-Span-1429">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1430"><span id="MJXp-Span-1431">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1432">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1433">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1434"><span id="MJXp-Span-1435">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1436">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1437"><span id="MJXp-Span-1438">b</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>In addition, the dot product contains the <strong>cosine</strong> of the angle between the two vectors (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1439"><span id="MJXp-Span-1440"><span id="MJXp-Span-1441">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1442">⋅</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1443"><span id="MJXp-Span-1444">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1445">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1446">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1447"><span id="MJXp-Span-1448">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1449">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1450">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1451"><span id="MJXp-Span-1452">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1453">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1454">c</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1455">o</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1456">s</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1457">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1458">α</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1459">)</span></span></span>), while the outer product contains the <strong>sine</strong> of the angle. Together they fully describe the angle between the vectors, as well the plane they form.</p>

<p>[Aside] The completeness of the description is what makes the product invertible, since we can get from one vector to the other using the information contained in their product. If I give you <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1460"><span id="MJXp-Span-1461"><span id="MJXp-Span-1462">a</span></span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1463"><span id="MJXp-Span-1464"><span id="MJXp-Span-1465">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1466"><span id="MJXp-Span-1467">b</span></span></span></span> you can get <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1468"><span id="MJXp-Span-1469"><span id="MJXp-Span-1470">b</span></span></span></span>. This could not be done with just the cosine, or just the sine/plane.</p>

<p>So the geometric product is:</p>

<p><span><span id="MJXp-Span-1471"><span id="MJXp-Span-1472"><span id="MJXp-Span-1473">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1474"><span id="MJXp-Span-1475">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1476">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1477"><span id="MJXp-Span-1478">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1479">⋅</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1480"><span id="MJXp-Span-1481">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1482">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1483"><span id="MJXp-Span-1484">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1485">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1486"><span id="MJXp-Span-1487">b</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>It is strange because multiplying two vectors together gives the sum of two different things: a scalar and a bivector. However this is similar to how a complex number is the sum of a scalar and an "imaginary" number, so you might be used to it already. Here the bivector part corresponds to the "imaginary" part of the complex number. <strong>Except it is not "imaginary," it's just a bivector, which we have a concrete picture of!</strong></p>

<p>Basically, by multiplying two vectors together we compute useful properties about them (the "length of their projections onto each other" / "cosine of the angle" (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1488"><span id="MJXp-Span-1489"><span id="MJXp-Span-1490">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1491">⋅</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1492"><span id="MJXp-Span-1493">b</span></span></span></span>), and the "plane they form together" / "sine of the angle" (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1494"><span id="MJXp-Span-1495"><span id="MJXp-Span-1496">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1497">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1498"><span id="MJXp-Span-1499">b</span></span></span></span>)), which we keep bundled together via the "plus" sign. The geometric product also gives these "property bundles" operations that can be applied to them, and these operations have geometric interpretations (for example: rotating and reflecting vectors), as we shall see now.</p>

<p>[Aside] It is possible to express the geometric product in terms of the sine and cosine: <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1500"><span id="MJXp-Span-1501"><span id="MJXp-Span-1502">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1503"><span id="MJXp-Span-1504">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1505">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1506">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1507"><span id="MJXp-Span-1508">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1509">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1510">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1511"><span id="MJXp-Span-1512">b</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1513">‖</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1514">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1515">c</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1516">o</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1517">s</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1518">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1519">α</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1520">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1521">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1522">s</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1523">i</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1524">n</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1525">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1526">α</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1527">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1528"><span id="MJXp-Span-1529">B</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1530">)</span></span></span> where <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1531"><span id="MJXp-Span-1532"><span id="MJXp-Span-1533">B</span></span></span></span> is a bivector in the plane of both vectors, made from two unit perpendicular vectors.</p>

<h3><!--[Aside]--> Multiplication Table </h3>

<p>The multiplication table helps make this product more concrete: let's see what happens if we take products of the basis vectors (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1534"><span id="MJXp-Span-1535"><span id="MJXp-Span-1536">x</span></span></span></span>,<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1537"><span id="MJXp-Span-1538"><span id="MJXp-Span-1539">y</span></span></span></span>,<span><span id="MJXp-Span-1540"><span id="MJXp-Span-1541"><span id="MJXp-Span-1542">z</span></span></span></span>).</p>

<p>This is done the usual way: we decompose <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1792"><span id="MJXp-Span-1793"><span id="MJXp-Span-1794">v</span></span></span></span> into a part perpendicular to the plane <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1795"><span id="MJXp-Span-1796"><span id="MJXp-Span-1797"><span id="MJXp-Span-1798">v</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1799">⊥</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1800">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1801">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1802"><span id="MJXp-Span-1803">v</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1804">⋅</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1805"><span id="MJXp-Span-1806">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1807">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1808"><span id="MJXp-Span-1809">a</span></span></span></span>, and a part parallel to the plane <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1810"><span id="MJXp-Span-1811"><span id="MJXp-Span-1812"><span id="MJXp-Span-1813">v</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1814">∥</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1815">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1816"><span id="MJXp-Span-1817">v</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1818">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1819"><span id="MJXp-Span-1820"><span id="MJXp-Span-1821">v</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1822">⊥</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1823">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1824"><span id="MJXp-Span-1825">v</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1826">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1827">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1828"><span id="MJXp-Span-1829">v</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1830">⋅</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1831"><span id="MJXp-Span-1832">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-1833">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-1834"><span id="MJXp-Span-1835">a</span></span></span></span>.</p>

<p>This is saying the exact same thing but in a different notation. Using a simple product notation instead of a formula to encode a fundamental operation such as a reflection is going to prove very useful!</p>

<div>
<p>[Aside] If you are wondering how taking the geometric product more than once works, just look at the basis vectors and use the associativity property. There are only four possible cases:</p>














</div>

<div>
<p>[Aside] For those curious it is possible to look at what happens at each step of <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2225"><span id="MJXp-Span-2226">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-2227"><span id="MJXp-Span-2228">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2229"><span id="MJXp-Span-2230">v</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2231"><span id="MJXp-Span-2232">a</span></span></span></span> in terms of the geometric product.</p>



</div>

<p>[Aside] The length of <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2669"><span id="MJXp-Span-2670"><span id="MJXp-Span-2671">a</span></span></span></span> is not very important so the following ignores it, but if <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2672"><span id="MJXp-Span-2673"><span id="MJXp-Span-2674">a</span></span></span></span> is not a unit vector, we must divide by its length and the formula becomes <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2675"><span id="MJXp-Span-2676">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-2677"><span id="MJXp-Span-2678">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2679"><span id="MJXp-Span-2680">v</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2681"><span id="MJXp-Span-2682"><span id="MJXp-Span-2683">a</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2684"><span id="MJXp-Span-2685">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-2686">1</span></span></span></span></span>, which looks more like the "Sandwich Product" you might be used to. </p>

<h3>Two Reflections is a Rotation: 2D case </h3>

<p>It turns out that if we apply two successive reflections to <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2687"><span id="MJXp-Span-2688"><span id="MJXp-Span-2689">v</span></span></span></span> (using vector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2690"><span id="MJXp-Span-2691"><span id="MJXp-Span-2692">a</span></span></span></span> followed by vector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2693"><span id="MJXp-Span-2694"><span id="MJXp-Span-2695">b</span></span></span></span>) we get <strong>a rotation by twice the angle between the vectors <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2696"><span id="MJXp-Span-2697"><span id="MJXp-Span-2698">a</span></span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2699"><span id="MJXp-Span-2700"><span id="MJXp-Span-2701">b</span></span></span></span>.</strong></p>

<p>You can apply each successive Reflection Step in the diagram below :</p>



<p>You can also change the vectors <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2702"><span id="MJXp-Span-2703"><span id="MJXp-Span-2704">a</span></span></span></span>, <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2705"><span id="MJXp-Span-2706"><span id="MJXp-Span-2707">b</span></span></span></span>, and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2708"><span id="MJXp-Span-2709"><span id="MJXp-Span-2710">v</span></span></span></span>, but the initial configuration of vectors in the diagram (click the "Reset Vector Positions" button) should make it especially clear why the rotation ends up being <strong>twice</strong> the angle. Another configuration that is not bad is to set <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2711"><span id="MJXp-Span-2712"><span id="MJXp-Span-2713">a</span></span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2714"><span id="MJXp-Span-2715"><span id="MJXp-Span-2716">b</span></span></span></span> to the <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2717"><span id="MJXp-Span-2718"><span id="MJXp-Span-2719">x</span></span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2720"><span id="MJXp-Span-2721"><span id="MJXp-Span-2722">y</span></span></span></span> axes.</p>

<h3>Two Reflections is a Rotation: 3D case </h3>

<p>In the 3D case the vector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2723"><span id="MJXp-Span-2724"><span id="MJXp-Span-2725">v</span></span></span></span> can be split into two different parts, one lying inside the plane defined by <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2726"><span id="MJXp-Span-2727"><span id="MJXp-Span-2728">a</span></span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2729"><span id="MJXp-Span-2730"><span id="MJXp-Span-2731">b</span></span></span></span>, and one lying outside (perpendicular to) the plane. As seen in the following diagram, when the vector gets reflected by each plane its outside part stays the same. So for the inside part, we are back to the 2D case, and it just gets rotated by twice the angle!</p>

<p>In fact the code/math is basically the same! The main difference is that <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2881"><span id="MJXp-Span-2882"><span id="MJXp-Span-2883">i</span></span></span></span>, <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2884"><span id="MJXp-Span-2885"><span id="MJXp-Span-2886">j</span></span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2887"><span id="MJXp-Span-2888"><span id="MJXp-Span-2889">k</span></span></span></span> get replaced by <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2890"><span id="MJXp-Span-2891"><span id="MJXp-Span-2892">y</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2893">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-2894"><span id="MJXp-Span-2895">z</span></span></span></span>, <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2896"><span id="MJXp-Span-2897"><span id="MJXp-Span-2898">x</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2899">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-2900"><span id="MJXp-Span-2901">z</span></span></span></span> and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2902"><span id="MJXp-Span-2903"><span id="MJXp-Span-2904">x</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2905">∧</span><span id="MJXp-Span-2906"><span id="MJXp-Span-2907">y</span></span></span></span>, but they work mostly the same way. Here is the <a href="https://marctenbosch.com/quaternions/code.htm">code comparison</a>. I did not include everything, such as log/exp for interpolation, but they are easy to make.</p>

<p>However, as we have seen, 3D Rotors are a 3D concept that does not require the use of "4D double rotations" or "stereographic projection" to visualize. Trying to visualize quaternions as operating in 4D just to explain 3D rotations is a bit like trying to understand planetary motion from an earth-centric perspective i.e. overly complex because you are looking at it from the wrong viewpoint.</p> 

<p>As we have seen, representing rotations as operating inside planes instead of around vectors helps a lot. For example the basis bivectors square to <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2908"><span id="MJXp-Span-2909">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-2910">1</span></span></span>, just like the basis quaternions (<span><span id="MJXp-Span-2911"><span id="MJXp-Span-2912"><span id="MJXp-Span-2913"><span id="MJXp-Span-2914">i</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2915">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2916">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-2917"><span id="MJXp-Span-2918"><span id="MJXp-Span-2919">j</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2920">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2921">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-2922"><span id="MJXp-Span-2923"><span id="MJXp-Span-2924">k</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2925">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-2926">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-2927">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-2928">1</span></span></span>) :</p>

	<p>Great because programming something often makes you understand it better. </p><blockquote>Note: in the book the authors give the impression that Geometric Algebra is slower than Quaternions (etc...). It actually should be almost the same exact code (i.e. don't write Geometric Algebra code by making a generic struct that can contain all possible types of k-vectors, just write one struct per k-vector type, as needed. This means writing one Bivector struct, and one Rotor struct which is a Scalar + Bivector to replace Quaternions).</blockquote></li>
