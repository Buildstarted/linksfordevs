<h2>User workflows</h2>
<p>These are some quick examples of the work we'd expect a .Net developer to want to get a feel for the design. A more complete reference follows.</p>
<h3>Ad-hoc Health Monitoring / 1st Level Performance Triage</h3>
<p><strong>Seeing performance counter values that refresh periodically in-place</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt; dotnet tool install -g dotnet-counters
You can invoke the tool using the following command: dotnet-counters
Tool 'dotnet-counters' (version '1.0.0') was successfully installed.
&gt; dotnet-counters monitor --process-id 1902 --refresh-interval 1 System.Runtime

Press p to pause, r to resume, q to quit.
System.Runtime:
    CPU Usage (%)                                 24
    Working Set (MB)                            1982

    Number of Exceptions / sec                     4
</code></pre>
<h3>Capture a trace for performance analysis</h3>
<p>For analyzing CPU usage, IO, lock contention, allocation rate, etc the investigator wants to capture a performance trace. This trace can then be moved to a developer machine where it can be analyzed with profiling tools such as PerfView/VisualStudio or visualized as a flame graph with speedscope (<a href="https://www.speedscope.app/" rel="nofollow">https://www.speedscope.app/</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Capture default trace</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt; dotnet tool install -g dotnet-trace
You can invoke the tool using the following command: dotnet-trace
Tool 'dotnet-trace' (version '1.0.0') was successfully installed.
&gt; dotnet trace collect --process-id 1902
No profile or providers specified, defaulting to trace profile 'cpu-sampling'
Recording trace 38MB

Trace complete: ~/trace.nettrace
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Convert a trace to use with speedscope</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt; dotnet trace convert ~/trace.nettrace --to-speedscope
Writing:     ~/trace.speedscope.json
Conversion complete
</code></pre>
<h3>Do a (dump-based) memory leak analysis</h3>
<p>For analyzing managed memory leaks over time, the investigator first wants to capture a series of dumps that will show the memory growth.</p>
<pre><code>$ dotnet tool install -g dotnet-dump
You can invoke the tool using the following command: dotnet-dump
Tool 'dotnet-dump' (version '1.0.0') was successfully installed.

$ dotnet dump collect --process-id 1902
Writing minidump with heap to file ./core_20190226_135837

</code></pre>
<p>Some time interval passes</p>
<pre><code>$ dotnet dump collect --process-id 1902
Writing minidump with heap to file ./core_20190226_135850
Written 98959360 bytes (24160 pages) to core file
Complete
</code></pre>
<p>Next the investigator needs to compare the heaps in these two dumps.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; dotnet dump analyze ./core_20190226_135850
Loading core dump: ./core_20190226_135850
$ gcheapdiff ./core_20190226_135837

...

To show all differences use 'gcheapdiff -all ./core_20190226_135850'
To show objects of a particular type use dumpheap -type &lt;type_name&gt;

$ dumpheap -type System.String

</code></pre>
<p>First we compared the leaky dump to the baseline dump to determine which types were growing, then listed addresses of particular instances of the leaking type, then determined the chain of references that was keeping that instance alive. The investigator may need to sample several instances of the leaked type to identify which ones are expected to be on the heap and which are not.</p>
<p>Note: The dumpheap/gcroot output is identical to SOS. I'm not convinced this output is ideal for clarity, but I am not proposing we change it at this time.</p>
<h3>Install SOS for use with LLDB</h3>

-p, --process-id
    The process to collect the trace from

-h, --help
    Show command line help

-o, --output
    The output path for the collected trace data. If not specified it defaults to ./trace.nettrace

--profile
    A named pre-defined set of provider configurations that allows common tracing scenarios to be specified
    succinctly. The options are:
    cpu-sampling    Useful for tracking CPU usage and general .NET runtime information. This is the default 
                    option if no profile or providers are specified.
    gc-verbose      Tracks GC collection and sampled object allocations
    gc-collect      Tracks GC collection only at very low overhead

--providers
    A list of comma separated EventPipe providers to be enabled.
    These providers are in addition to any providers implied by the --profile argument. If there is any
    discrepancy for a particular provider, the configuration here takes precedence over the implicit
    configuration from the profile.
    A provider consists of the name and optionally the keywords, verbosity level, and custom key/value pairs.

    The string is written 'Provider[,Provider]'
        Provider format: KnownProviderName[:Keywords[:Level][:KeyValueArgs]]
            KnownProviderName       - The provider's name
            Keywords                - 8 character hex number bit mask
            Level                   - A number in the range [0, 5], or their corresponding text values (refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventlevel?view=netframework-4.8).
            KeyValueArgs            - A semicolon separated list of key=value
        KeyValueArgs format: '[key1=value1][;key2=value2]'

--buffersize &lt;Size&gt;
    Sets the size of the in-memory circular buffer in megabytes. Default 256 MB.

--format
    The format of the output trace file. The default value is nettrace.


Examples:
  
  To perform a default `cpu-tracing` profiling:

  &gt; dotnet trace collect --process-id 1902
  No profile or providers specified, defaulting to trace profile 'cpu-sampling'
  Recording trace 38MB

  's' - stop tracing


  To collect just the GC keyword events from the .NET runtime at informational level:

  &gt; dotnet trace collect --process-id 1902 --providers Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime:0x1:Informational

                     &lt;trace_file_path&gt;

Converts traces to alternate formats for use with alternate trace analysis tools

-h, --help
    Show command line help

-o, --output
    The path where the converted file is written. If unspecified the file is written in the current directory
    using the same base filename as the input file and the extension appropriate for the new format.

--format
    Specifies the format to convert the nettrace file to. Currently, the only valid input is 'speedscope'.

trace_file_path
    The path to the trace file that should be converted. The trace file can be a nettrace file. Defaults to 'trace.nettrace'.

Examples:
  &gt; dotnet-trace convert trace.nettrace -f speedscope
  Writing:       ./trace.speedscope.json

      path and file name of the dump.

  --type
      The dump type determines the kinds of information that are collected from the process. There are two types:
      heap - A large and relatively comprehensive dump containing module lists, thread lists, all stacks,
             exception information, handle information, and all memory except for mapped images.
      mini - A small dump containing module lists, thread lists, exception information and all stacks.

      If not specified 'heap' is the default.

<h2>General CLI/Workflow Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do we want an alternate installation technique that doesn't require the SDK?</p>
<p>Not immediately, but it should probably follow shortly after getting an SDK based option in place. There are several alternate installation options customers might want for more production oriented scenarios such as FDD and self-contained apps available as network downloads, or docker images that are pre-provisioned with the tools. We'll likely need customer feedback to prioritize.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we want a single multi-purpose tool, or a larger number of narrower purpose tools?</p>
<p>Narrow purpose tools.</p>
<p>Rationale: Originally I was leaning towards multi-purpose but there are various reasons this approach was awkward:
(a) dotnet's CLI guidance is that the term after dotnet is a 'context', but a multi-purpose tool doesn't make a very useful context. In most cases the verb that would follow needed another sub-context noun to determine the operation. For example 'dotnet diag collect trace' vs. 'dotnet diag collect dump.' Many of the parameters that make sense for a trace don't make sense for a dump and vice-versa so you either end up with workarounds such as a super-set of all possible arguments, arguments that are context sensitive based on earlier arguments, or verbs that are really verb-noun combinations (ie 'collect-dump'). None of these seem to match dotnet conventions.
(b) Putting the verbs before the sub-context noun makes it hard to determine what each sub-context supports with help commands. For example dotnet analyze dump_file would be supported but dotnet analyze trace_file wouldn't (for now at least).
(c) It encourages higher levels of abstraction and consistency than realistically exist. For example 'dotnet collect' was appealing if you imagined defining a collection plan that could have all sorts of triggers and different collected artifacts that ultimately gets zipped up in a nice package. But building that requires substantial additional work over a basic trace or dump collector.</p>
<p>Multi-purpose tool did have a few advantages we are giving up:
(a) Size on disk would have been better. Each tool must include the closure of its non-framework dependencies which means if any tools share a dependency (symbol loading for example) there will be multiple copies of that assembly in the global tools install directory
(b) A single dotnet install command. We could improve this in dotnet tool install itself, for example by allowing multiple tools to be listed in an install command (similar to many package managers) or supporting a tool meta-package that is just a grouping of related tools. In the meantime we should try to avoid needing too many different tools in the same workflow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we have a stripped down stand-alone collector?</p>
<p>Not at this time, though I still advocate for good layering. There are at least two useful scenarios for this I could see, one is a persistent monitoring agent and the other is on-demand install by support engineers in response to a production problem. In the latter case size on disk is probably only a small concern relative to being able to isolate and customer confidence in the tools. If we could lose the SDK dependency we'd probably be in decent shape there. In the former case size does matter more, but we again be better optimizing for no SDK dependency and FDD deployment before eliminating the analysis components becomes the top size issue. There are also other non-size concerns if we ultimately go this path such as daemonizing the tool, log cycling, auto-triggered collections and remote administration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we support command line response files?</p>
<p>If System.CommandLine supports something default out-of-the-box (and @jonsequitur says it does) then we should use it. We can update the spec once any details are better understood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we support '/' style args that are more common on windows or only '--' style args?</p>
<p>Not at this time (feel like a broken record yet?). We should document and parse all arguments accepting only the single dash or double dash form. For example -h or --help are recognized for help, but /help is not. This keeps us identical to the behavior of other dotnet tools.
FWIW there might be value in accepting the /arg form of arguments but I'd rather it gets taken up across all dotnet tools or as a generic feature of the command-line parsing library so that we have some degree of standardization. Even if we did start recognizing the /arg form, I still suggest only printing the -/-- forms in the help to prevent clutter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we want the tool be 'dotnet' prefixed or use a separate tool name?</p>
<p>Dotnet prefixed. Our tools have similarities in function and naming to other non-dotnet tools, so including something that evokes 'dotnet' is important to distinguish them. Java established a precedent of putting a 'j' in front of their tool names but if we followed suit ('d' or 'dn' perhaps) I think it would only create confusion with dotnet's convention of using 'dotnet'. We could also try to name the tools something complete different (SOS is one example) and get users to still associate the name with dotnet, but it feels harder and less effective than simply naming 'dotnet' explicitly. Other names appear to be less discoverable, less easily predicted, and if we don't pick catchy names, probably less easily remembered.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Area specific Questions</h2>
<h3>dotnet-counters</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do we need pre-defined counter sets to make some typical cases easier?</p>
<p>Not right now, though there is some contention around it. My opinion at the moment is that this feature would probably be useful, but it isn't necessary to create an MVP. If customers try the tool and say it needs profiles I'm happy to add it. @shirhatti and @richlander suggest that we should add it immediately without waiting for that feedback. I'm open to continue the discussion, but I haven't been convinced yet. If nothing changes in the next few weeks on that front then I think we'll wind up shipping a Preview that doesn't have this feature and we'll see what feedback we get.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we want to adjust our provider names?</p>
<p>SYstem.Runtime is expected to be the final name for the runtime provider. The rest is TBD placeholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What counters exactly are we going to expose and how will we name them?</p>
<p>TBD. The exact set of counters doesn't matter too much for CLI concerns but a few guidelines that will help.</p>
<ol>
<li>Providers shouldn't have more than ~40 counters or it will be awkward to display them all in a single console window column</li>
<li>Counter names shouldn't be too long, and they should not use spaces as separators. The '-' character is a better separator</li>
<li>Counters should have separate display names that use spaces and indicate measurement units.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>dotnet-trace</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add a useful starting point profile for ASP.NET performance investigations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does dotnet-trace support other tracing systems or EventPipe only?</p>
<p>EventPipe only, at least for now. Trying to be a front-end for various other tracing systems (etw, perf, lttng) comes with a substantial increase in complexity and other tools are already doing that such as PerfView and perfcollect. Although creating a unified front-end might have a little value, it is lower priority than doing a good job at our key goal - providing a platform agnostic solution for managed CPU and memory investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we need to support triggers to start/stop collection?</p>
<p>Not right now. Triggers are a very useful automation primitive and I could imagine wanting to add support in the near future, but many basic scenarios can be resolved without them. They can be added to collect/run commands as options in a fairly non-disruptive way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does dotnet-trace need to support user-specified in-memory buffer sizes?</p>
<p>We should try to pick some reasonable default for now. If at some point its obvious that isn't working well or it would be easier to make it user-configurable and be done with it we should do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should we pack traces as zip or diagsession?</p>
<p>TBD. Diagsession is a Visual Studio container format for profiling data so using that makes engineering a little easier for VS and indicates more clearly that the data is compatible with VS. On the other hand zip is format that nearly every developer should be familiar with, it would serve largely the same role in this case, and it is more easily manipulated by other tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What binaries/symbols do we collect during the pack operation?</p>
<p>By default we should collect symbols for all non-Microsoft managed binaries refered to in the trace, if they are locatable on the machine. These are symbols that may not be recoverable during trace analysis on another machine because there is no guarantee they are on a symbol server. All Microsoft provided binaries and symbols are available on the symbol server. As of .Net Core 3.0 we will also be fully off of NGEN (assuming our CoreLib plans go forward) and it is much easier to extract symbol&lt;-&gt;RVA mapping information for R2R images without requiring a special runtime matched crossgen binary. This should eliminate any need to precompute and package NGEN PDBs.</p>
<p>We could have non-default options to capture more or fewer symbols based on the users expectations of symbol availability on their analysis machine or their willingness to forego symbolic information to make a trace smaller.</p>
<p>Todo - design these options.</p>

<p>Do we need a memory comparison command that is more generic than GC heap? For example VMDiff?</p>
<p>Not yet, though it really feels pretty useful to me if we expect our customers not to automatically equate memory growth == gc heap growth. I could imagine wanting to add something like this soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we have a mechanism to pack dumps similar to our packing of traces?</p>
<p>Not for now, but probably something we'll want in the near future. Our tools are still picky about needing to analyze dumps on a machine of the same OS so I am assuming most investigation will occur on the same machine.</p>

<h3>Pprof</h3>
<p>Pprof is both a runtime library used by golang to collect trace data as well as a CLI tool to visualize that data after it has been collected. The CLI tool is the focus here. Snippets below from <a href="https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/doc/README.md">https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/doc/README.md</a></p>
<p>Pprof follows the convention Pprof &lt;format&gt; [options] source.</p>
<p>Unlike many of the other tools there is no need for a verb because it only does one action, reporting on trace data. Source can be an on-disk file or a URL that is streaming the trace data. Format is flexible enough to include text on the console, file based graphics formats, and optionally starting a web browser to visualize content.</p>
<p>Interactive terminal use:</p>
<pre><code>pprof [options] source
</code></pre>
<p>Web Interface</p>
<pre><code>pprof -http=[host]:[port] [options] source
</code></pre>
<p>Common options:</p>
<ul>
<li>-flat [default], -cum: Sort entries based on their flat or cumulative weight respectively, on text reports.</li>
<li>-functions [default], -filefunctions, -files, -lines, -addresses: Generate the report using the specified granularity.</li>
<li>-noinlines: Attribute inlined functions to their first out-of-line caller. For example, a command like pprof -list foo -noinlines profile.pb.gz can be used to produce the annotated source listing attributing the metrics in the inlined functions to the out-of-line calling line.</li>
<li>-nodecount= int: Maximum number of entries in the report. pprof will only print this many entries and will use heuristics to select which entries to trim.</li>
<li>-focus= regex: Only include samples that include a report entry matching regex.</li>
<li>-ignore= regex: Do not include samples that include a report entry matching regex.</li>
<li>-show_from= regex: Do not show entries above the first one that matches regex.</li>
<li>-show= regex: Only show entries that match regex.</li>
<li>-hide= regex: Do not show entries that match regex.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jcmd</h3>
<p>Java previously had numerous single-role tools such as jhat, jps, jstack, jinfo, etc that did a variety of diagnostic tasks (respectively they show heap analysis, process status, stacks, and runtime/machine info). Starting in Java8 jcmd, a new multi-role tool, offers a super-set of functionality from all those tools. Snippets below are from <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/tooldescr006.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/tooldescr006.html</a></p>
<p>Jcmd uses a Jcmd &lt;process_id/main_class&gt;  [options] convention. The set of verbs that are supported varies dynamically depending on the version of the java runtime running in the indicated process. This makes jcmd more of a proxy for a CLI in the runtime than a CLI tool in its own right.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; jcmd

<h3>WPR</h3>
<p>The Windows Performance Recorder is a CLI or GUI tool to capture etw traces on windows. Rather than tracing directly in the WPR process, the trace operates similar to a background service and WPR is a front-end that sends commands to modify its operation. Snippets below from  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/hh448229(v=win.10)" rel="nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/hh448229(v=win.10)</a></p>
<p>WPR uses the WPR -&lt;verb&gt; [options] convention.</p>
<pre><code>wpr {-profiles [&lt;path&gt; [ â€¦]] |
     -start&lt;arguments&gt; |
     -stop&lt;arguments&gt; |
     -cancel |
     -status&lt;arguments&gt; |
     -log&lt;argument&gt; |
     -purgecache |
     -help&lt;arguments&gt; |
     -profiledetails |
     -disablepagingexecutive}
</code></pre>
<p>WPR does not support a default file name for saving, the filename must be explicitly provided.</p>
<h3>Perfview</h3>
<p>Perfview is CLI or GUI tool that allows collecting, analyzing and viewing ETW traces.</p>
<p>PerfView uses the PerfView  [options] CLI convention:</p>
<pre><code>PerfView [DataFile]
    run CommandAndArgs ...
    collect [DataFile]
    start [DataFile]
    stop
    mark [Message]
    abort
    merge [DataFile]
    unzip [DataFile]
    listSessions
    ListCpuCounters
    EnableKernelStacks
    DisableKernelStacks
    HeapSnapshot Process [DataFile]
    ForceGC Process
    HeapSnapshotFromProcessDump ProcessDumpFile [DataFile]
    GuiRun
    GuiCollect
    GuiHeapSnapshot
    UserCommand CommandAndArgs ...
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>PerfView has some commands that manipulate an ongoing trace without keeping the PerfView process running (example: start/stop/mark/abort), other commands that capture traces synchronously (example: collect/run), and then further commands that manipulate or view trace data that is already on disk.</p>
<p>When no filename is specified, PerfView saves trace data as PerfViewData.etl[.zip]</p>
<h3>ProcDump</h3>
<p>ProcDump is a tool for capturing one or more process dumps (core file on Linux). Historically it was Windows only but it has recently been made cross-platform. Snippets below are from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump" rel="nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump</a></p>
<p>ProcDump uses CLI convention: ProcDump [options]</p>
<pre><code>usage: procdump [-a] [[-c|-cl CPU usage] [-u] [-s seconds]] [-n exceeds] [-e [1 [-b]] [-f &lt;filter,...&gt;] [-g] [-h]
 [-l] [-m|-ml commit usage] [-ma | -mp] [-o] [-p|-pl counter threshold] [-r] [-t] [-d &lt;callback DLL&gt;] [-64] &lt;[-w]
 &lt;process name or service name or PID&gt; [dump file] | -i &lt;dump file&gt; | -u | -x &lt;dump file&gt; &lt;image file&gt; [arguments]
 &gt;] [-? [ -e]
Parameter
Description
-a
Avoid outage. Requires -r. If the trigger will cause the target to suspend for a prolonged time due to an exceeded concurrent dump limit, the trigger will be skipped.
-b
Treat debug breakpoints as exceptions (otherwise ignore them).
-c
CPU threshold at which to create a dump of the process.
-cl
CPU threshold below which to create a dump of the process.
-
</code></pre>
<p>d
Invoke the minidump callback routine named MiniDumpCallbackRoutine of the specified DLL.
-e
Write a dump when the process encounters an unhandled exception. Include the 1 to create dump on first chance exceptions.
-f
Filter the first chance exceptions. Wildcards (*) are supported. To just display the names without dumping, use a blank ("") filter.
-g
Run as a native debugger in a managed process (no interop).
-h
Write dump if process has a hung window (does not respond to window messages for at least 5 seconds).
-i
Install ProcDump as the AeDebug postmortem debugger. Only -ma, -mp, -d and -r are supported as additional options.
-l
Display the debug logging of the process.
-m
Memory commit threshold in MB at which to create a dump.
-ma
Write a dump file with all process memory. The default dump format only includes thread and handle information.
-ml
Trigger when memory commit drops below specified MB value.
-mp
Write a dump file with thread and handle information, and all read/write process memory. To minimize dump size, memory areas larger than 512MB are searched for, and if found, the largest area is excluded. A memory area is the collection of same sized memory allocation areas. The removal of this (cache) memory reduces Exchange and SQL Server dumps by over 90%.
-n
Number of dumps to write before exiting.
-o
Overwrite an existing dump file.
-p
Trigger on the specified performance counter when the threshold is exceeded. Note: to specify a process counter when there are multiple instances of the process running, use the process ID with the following syntax: "\Process(_)\counter"
-pl
Trigger when performance counter falls below the specified value.
-r
Dump using a clone. Concurrent limit is optional (default 1, max 5).
CAUTION: a high concurrency value may impact system performance.
- Windows 7   : Uses Reflection. OS doesn't support -e.
- Windows 8.0 : Uses Reflection. OS doesn't support -e.
- Windows 8.1+: Uses PSS. All trigger types are supported.
-s
Consecutive seconds before dump is written (default is 10).
-t
Write a dump when the process terminates.
-u
Treat CPU usage relative to a single core (used with -c).
As the only option, Uninstalls ProcDump as the postmortem debugger.
-w
Wait for the specified process to launch if it's not running.
-x
Launch the specified image with optional arguments. If it is a Store Application or Package, ProcDump will start on the next activation (only).
-64
By default ProcDump will capture a 32-bit dump of a 32-bit process when running on 64-bit Windows. This option overrides to create a 64-bit dump. Only use for WOW64 subsystem debugging.
-?
Use -? -e to see example command lines.</p>
<p>When creating dumps, procdump uses a default output format of PROCESSNAME_YYMMDD_HHMMSS.dmp
where:</p>
<pre><code>PROCESSNAME = Process Name
YYMMDD = Year/Month/Day
HHMMSS = Hour/Minute/Second
</code></pre>
<h3>Perfmon</h3>
<p>Perfmon is a Windows GUI tool that shows interactive performance counters and some reports of system performance. It has a minimal CLI that simply launches different GUI views.</p>
