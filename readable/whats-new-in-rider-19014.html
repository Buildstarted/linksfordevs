<p>Rider 2019.3 offers outstanding support for T4 templates, a cross-platform
                        profiler for .NET Core, and cross-platform test coverage for Unity. Startup is faster, the
                        debugger supports Docker Compose, and Version Control support and Xamarin support are enhanced
                        across the board.

<h3 data-title="T4 templates" title="T4 templates" id="v2019-3-t4-templates">Support for T4 templates</h3>
<p>You asked us to support <em>T4 text templates</em>, and we‚Äôve delivered! Based on our
                            own generator and available as a pre-installed plugin, <em>T4 templates support</em> is
                            here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you can easily execute, process, and debug all your T4 templates in Rider. We hope you
                            enjoy the new in-editor assistance, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature-rich C# support in code blocks, including code highlighting, navigation, code
                                completion, typing assistance, refactorings, context actions, inspections, formatting,
                                and more.
                            </li>
<li>Support for T4-specific features such as inspections, typing assistance, folding, and
                                brace matching.
                            </li>
<li>Extensive support for <code>include</code> directives to make resolving C# code as
                                correct as possible.
                            </li>
<li>Support for all kinds of directives, including inspections, quick-fixes, code
                                highlighting, navigation, and more.
                            </li>
</ul>
<p>All these features work on <em>Windows</em>, <em>macOS</em>, and <em>Linux</em>.</p>

                            Cross-platform profiler for .NET Core</h3>
<p>Rider 2019.1 brought the performance profiler to macOS and Linux, but it only supported Mono
                            and Unity Mono applications at the time. With this release, we‚Äôve taken a huge step
                            forward, and it‚Äôs now possible to profile .NET Core applications on Linux and macOS
                            using the embedded <strong>dotTrace</strong> plugin. This means that you can profile any
                            .NET applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
<p>Note that only projects targeting .NET Core 3.1 are fully supported. Because of some .NET
                            Core limitations, profiling of projects targeting .NET Core 3.0 or earlier may, in rare
                            cases, cause the profiled application to hang or crash.</p>

<h3 data-title="Test Coverage for Unity" id="v2019-3-test-coverage-for-unity">Test —Åoverage for Unity</h3>
<p>We really enjoy trying to improve the Unity scripting experience, and we strive to deliver
                            something outstanding with every release. This time, we are introducing cross-platform test
                            coverage and continuous testing for your Unity Edit mode tests!</p>
<p>These are some of the new features to get excited about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play mode unit tests are now supported in the Unit Test runner.</li>
<li>Rider supports <code>UIElements</code> with syntax highlighting, code completion, and schema
                                validation of <em>UXML</em> and <em>USS</em> files.
                            </li>
<li>Support for <code>.asmdef</code> files is back!</li>
<li>The project name is shown for Unity Editors when listing processes for debugging.</li>
<li>We‚Äôve improved performance parsing assets when the project loads initially.</li>
<li>‚ÄúClear on play‚Äù supported in Rider‚Äôs log viewer tool window.</li>
<li>That annoying bug when Rider would suggest C# 8 features is now fixed.</li>
<li>We‚Äôve fixed various edge cases keeping <code>.meta</code> files up-to-date during
                                refactorings.
                            </li>
</ul>
<p>These are just the highlights. As always, there are plenty of other smaller fixes and
                            features in this release. Check out the full list in <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-unity/blob/net193/CHANGELOG.md#20193">the

<p>Rider 2019.3 automatically includes all the performance optimizations that we added to the
                            <em>IntelliJ Platform</em> during our recent <em>Quality Marathon</em>. Here are just a few
                            of the key improvements: startup performance has improved a lot, smooth mouse scrolling is
                            here, and we‚Äôve eliminated a lot of UI freezes. If you‚Äôre interested, you can
                            read more about all the <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/10/preview-the-performance-improvements-in-intellij-idea-2019-3/">performance

                            Docker Compose reaches the debugger</h3>
<p>In the 2018.2 release, we introduced Docker support into the debugger to let you debug
                            containers built from a <code>Dockerfile</code> in Rider. However, debugging containers created
                            using <em>Docker Compose</em> (<code>docker-compose.yml</code>) was not supported at the time.
                        </p>
<p>Well, the wait is over! <em>Docker Compose</em> support has finally reached the debugger! Now
                            you can debug multi-container Docker applications with the click of a mouse.</p>

<h3 data-title="Edit &amp; Continue" title="Edit &amp; Continue" id="v2019-3-edit--continue">Edit &amp; Continue becomes even better</h3>
<p><em>Edit &amp; Continue</em> can now apply changes to a running (not suspended) application,
                            and the application does not need to be stopped at a breakpoint. You can apply changes
                            anytime by clicking the ‚ÄúApply Changes‚Äù link on the tooltip at the top of the
                            editor tab. Additionally, you can disable the automatic application of <em>Edit &amp;

<div>
<h3 data-title="Debugger improvements" id="v2019-3-debugger-improvements">Debugger improvements</h3>
<p>We have made lots of changes to other parts of the debugger. First of all, the Exceptions
                            tree in the Breakpoints view has had a big update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search now works on collapsed nodes.</li>
<li>Exceptions are grouped by both a type (User/System) and a namespace.</li>
<li>The main node has a new name, ‚ÄúCLR Exceptions‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, Remote Debugging has received a couple of updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are now better descriptions and notifications for errors that might occur when you
                                use it.
                            </li>
<li>If a password or passphrase for Remote Debugging is not specified, it will prompt you
                                for one when you connect to a remote server.
                            </li>
</ul>
<p>And finally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of debugger actions were given new names that better explain what they do.</li>
<li>The ‚ÄúPin to top‚Äù feature supports recursive evaluation.</li>
<li>The ‚ÄúJump to Type Source‚Äù action is now available.</li>
<li>The ‚ÄúJust my code‚Äù option for exception breakpoints works much better on
                                Mono.
                            </li>

<div>
<h3 data-title="Updated VCS support" id="v2019-3-updated-vcs-support">Updated VCS support</h3>
<p>We‚Äôve started experimenting with user interface and user experience improvements when
                            working with version control systems like Git. In this release, a new live <em>diff
                                preview</em> opens right in the code editor tab to provide a much better user
                            experience.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also introduced a new Commit tool window, which is shown on the left by default
                            so as to leave more vertical screen space for change lists, commit descriptions, and so
                            on.</p>
<p>If you can‚Äôt find the Version Control tab on your first launch of Rider 2019.3, don‚Äôt
                            worry; it‚Äôs still there, but it has a new name: <em>Repository</em>.</p>
<p>Besides that, we‚Äôve improved the ‚ÄúCompare with Current‚Äù view, reworked the
                            Clone dialog, and made it possible to push a non-active branch.</p>

<p>In this release cycle, we‚Äôve put a lot of effort into optimizing the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11349-aws-toolkit"><em>AWS Toolkit</em>
                            plugin</a> for .NET developers and making it compatible with Rider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a predefined project template to create a new <em>AWS serverless application</em>.
                            </li>
<li>You can create, run, and debug an <strong>AWS Lambda locally and remotely</strong>. What‚Äôs
                                more, you can do all of it right from the editor, using just the gutter icons.
                            </li>
<li>You can deploy your Serverless app to AWS.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Debugging</strong> support is here! You can debug your cloud .NET Core
                                applications running on <em>Amazon ECS</em> with <em>AWS Fargate</em> directly inside a
                                remote container in a cloud, without any local emulation.
                            </li>
<li>The plugin is available for both Rider v2019.2 and v2019.3.</li>
</ul>

<h3 data-title="Xamarin support" title="Xamarin support" id="v2019-3-xamarin-support">Leveled up Xamarin support</h3>
<p>We‚Äôve continued to make Rider a great IDE for Xamarin development and delivered some
                            sweet improvements for both Xamarin Android and Xamarin iOS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple devices and simulators now discover better on Macs thanks to integrated JetBrains
                                AppCode components.
                            </li>
<li>You can find the list of connected Apple devices on the toolbar.</li>
<li>We now support <em>mtouch</em> (Mono Compiler for iOS) device builds.</li>
<li>‚ÄúPublish Android APK‚Äù is available for Xamarin Android projects (look for
                                the ‚ÄúArchive or Publish‚Äù action in the context menu for a project).
                            </li>
<li>You can edit Android-specific project properties in the Project Properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, we haven‚Äôt forgotten about Xamarin Forms support, which has a couple of important
                            fixes such as <code>x:DataType</code> and <code>Class</code> attribute support.</p>

<h3 data-title="Even Better C# 8 support" id="v2019-3-even-better-c-8-support">Even Better C# 8 support</h3>
<p>The new Rider release handles C# 8 even better. It now includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of <em>Nullable Reference</em> types including support for <code>notnull</code>
                                constraints.
                            </li>
<li>Target-typed <code>switch</code> expressions.</li>
<li>Early support for default interface methods.</li>
<li>A new "<em>Local function can be static</em>" hint with an accompanying quick-fix.</li>
<li>A new quick-fix to enable nullable annotations and warnings in a file, project, or all
                                projects in a solution.
                            </li>
<li>A new quick-fix to add the <code>EnumeratorCancellation</code> attribute to <code>CancellationToken</code>
                                parameters of <code>async</code> iterators.
                            </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the code inspection "<em>Type or type member is never used</em>" has been split
                            into two separate options, one for types (<em>Type is never used</em>) and another for type
                            members (<em>Type member is never used</em>).</p>

<h3 data-title="Code Generation" id="v2019-3-code-generation">Code Generation</h3>
<p>The Generate action knows more about C# 8 and helps you learn, too, with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new quick-fix "<em>Add missing arms</em>" to check enum values exhaustively.</li>
<li>A new quick-fix and context action to generate type patterns in switch expressions.</li>
<li><em>Nullability</em> being taken into account when generating <em>equality/relational
                                members/comparers</em>.
                            </li>
</ul>
<p>Also, there is a new Option to use <code>System.HashCode</code> to implement
                            <code>GetHashCode</code> when generating equality members or equality comparers for C# and
                            VB.NET, which will help make your code cleaner.</p>

                            you could run the ‚Äú<em>Find dependent code</em>‚Äù action on a reference to find
                            all the places where types or type members from that reference appeared. However, there were
                            some limitations. With this release, we eliminated a couple of them: <em>Find dependent
                                code </em>works for NuGet references, and it can be run for a whole solution instead of
                            just a project.</p>
<p>Now Rider definitely has more to offer: </p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Quick definition</em> overlay tooltip is available for any symbols in the code
                                editor, allowing you to quickly review a symbol‚Äôs definition without leaving the
                                current context.
                            </li>
<li><em>Consuming APIs</em> extends ‚ÄúNavigate to‚Äù actions and might be helpful
                                if you want to list all methods that receive objects of a specific type in their
                                parameters.
                            </li>
<li>The <em>Find results window</em> for <em>Find dependent code</em> has new filters.</li>
<li>You can now navigate to the external sources of NuGet packages that have a source
                                symbols package.
                            </li>

<h3 data-title="Code Style" id="v2019-3-code-style">Code Style</h3>
<p>In this release, we‚Äôve delivered on one more long-awaited request. C# naming settings
                            now support reading from/exporting to<em> EditorConfig</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to this huge change, there are several smaller changes that give you more control
                            over the style of your code:</p>
<ul>
<li>For those who prefer to use `var` instead of explicit types only when the type of
                                initializer expression is evident, Rider can now detect the more evident cases. There is
                                also a ‚Äúcompatibility‚Äù mode to match the Roslyn behavior.
                            </li>
<li>There is a new code style option, which is compatible with StyleCop and Roslyn, to add
                                parentheses that clarify precedence only for a group of operators nested with others
                                from the same group. For example, if you can‚Äôt remember whether
                                <em>&amp;&amp;</em> or <em>||</em> takes precedence, this option will help you clarify
                                it with parentheses.
                            </li>
<li><em>Comment Code</em> now adds an indent to a comment by default. There‚Äôs a new
                                setting to ‚Äú<em>Place comments at first column when commenting out code</em>‚Äù
                                if you want to turn it off.
                            </li>
<li>The options pages to set up indentations now display the appropriate notification when
                                the <em>Autodetect indent size and value</em> setting is ON.
                            </li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a notification tooltip explaining the <em>Configure formatting</em> and <em>Autodetect
                            formatting</em> features on the C# formatter options pages.</p>

<h3 data-title="Project model improvements" id="v2019-3-project-model-improvements">Project model improvements</h3>
<p>Rider‚Äôs project model now extends any refactorings you make in your web language files,
                            such as TypeScript files, to all your project files. For instance, ‚Äú<em>moving a TS
                                class to a separate file</em>‚Äù updates the corresponding <code>.csproj</code> file
                            with the change. We‚Äôve also improved the UX for the ‚Äú<em>Not Built</em>‚Äù
                            project state in the <em>Solution Explorer</em>.</p>
<p>Please note that we‚Äôve dropped our support for <em>.NET Core 1.* SDK</em>, as these
                            versions have reached their end-of-support dates.</p>

<h3 data-title="Other features" id="v2019-3-other-features">Other features</h3>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôve improved Rider‚Äôs support for project files (like <em>.csproj</em>
                                files) by making code completion aware of various MSBuild items. You can also use an
                                inspection and a quick-fix for <em>&lt;TargetFramework&gt;</em>/<em>&lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;</em>
                                validation.
                            </li>
<li>We now generate the predefined run configuration in a smarter way, so that you can run
                                it without any additional movements or adjustments. It also has an appropriate
                                auto-generated name instead of the boring ‚ÄúDefault‚Äù.
                            </li>
<li>More MSBuild properties specified in a <em>launchSettings.json</em> file, such as <em>$(ProjectDir)</em>,
                                are now supported.
                            </li>
<li>The Parameter Info popup is available for tuples.</li>
<li>Typing assists for deleting new lines, and for backspacing before a new line, now leave
                                a space in order to separate tokens, or when this is required by the formatting rules.

<li>Identifier highlighting has been completely reworked with a separate page for C#,
                                separate colors for preprocessor directives, static methods, fields, etc.
                            </li>
<li>New NUnit inspections cover combinatorial unit tests and individual parameters of
                                parameterized unit tests.
                            </li>
<li>The Expand All button is back on the left-hand toolbar.</li>
<li>A new reactive TFS client has been released in an experimental mode. To enable it, you
                                just need to open <em>Settings | Version Control | TFVC</em> and turn it ON. This
                                provides a dramatic speed improvement for the "Checking for changes" action (it‚Äôs
                                now about 100~1000 times as fast in our tests). Many operations, such as Commit and
                                History actions, will be ported to the new client after the initial release.

<p>Rider has implemented one more highly-anticipated feature from ReSharper ‚Äì File Layout
                            patterns can be modified via the <em>XAML View</em> (with code completion and code
                            highlighting) right in <em>Rider‚Äôs Settings/Preferences</em>: <em>Editor | Code Style

                            for <em>aspx/ascx </em>files. Now, when you add a new control to an <em>.aspx</em> file and
                            access it from the code-behind (<em>.aspx.cs</em>), the generator creates the corresponding

<p>In this release, we‚Äôve introduced the long-awaited <strong>WinForms designer</strong>
                            to help you create, observe, and modify the UI of your Windows Forms application. </p>
<p><strong>The WinForms Toolbox</strong> window displays controls that you can add onto a form
                            surface. The Toolbox has the same default set of components as Visual Studio. You can
                            copy/paste different controls from the Toolbox tab onto the surface of the designer, and
                            resize and move the controls. In addition, you can easily search for components using the
                            search field at the top of the tab.</p>
<p>A new <em>Windows Form Application</em> project template is available, as well as file
                            templates for <em>forms</em>, <em>user controls</em>, and <em>components</em>.</p>
<p>As for limitations, please note that drag&amp;drop of components from the Toolbox onto a
                            form, VB.NET WinForms applications, and 3rd-party controls is not supported.</p>

                            applications (no Mono / Mono Unity). The performance profiler currently supports Mono 5.6+
                            and Mono Unity 2018.3+ applications (but not .NET Core).</p>

                            document, and help you navigate that structure.</p>
<p>To jump to a parent element in the source code, click the breadcrumb with its name. If you
                            click the namespace element in a C#, VB.NET, or F# file, you will be able to navigate to all

<h3 data-title="Xamarin support" title="Xamarin support" id="v2019-1-xamarin-support">Xamarin support reaches the new level</h3>
<p>Excellent news for all Xamarin app developers ‚Äì we‚Äôve built our own <strong>JetBrains
                            Xamarin SDK</strong> which lets you develop Xamarin on Windows/macOS without having Visual
                            Studio licenses/installation on your machine. It uses the same sources as the original MS
                            one, so you will have the same experience using JetBrains Xamarin SDK as you have with the
                            original one. </p>
<p>Another piece of good news is that <strong>Rider integrates directly with Xcode</strong>!
                            Thanks to this integration, you can use the Interface Builder in Xcode to create user
                            interfaces of your macOS project in your Xamarin application.</p>
<p>There are a couple of changes in the Xamarin Android support. First, the functionality has
                            been extracted to a non-bundled plugin available from the Plugin Repository. You‚Äôll
                            need to install this plugin first to get all the goodies.</p>
<p>Second, the new Android SDK wizard is here to help you install all of the required SDKs for
                            Android development if you open an Android project in Rider the first time.</p>

<div>
<h3 data-title="Performance improvements" id="v2019-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>
<p>After releasing Rider 2018.3, we received a lot of feedback about performance, so we
                            focused on improving this area:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since we moved the <em>Xamarin Android support</em> to a separate, non-bundled plugin,
                                the time between clicking on the Rider icon and showing the splash screen with the
                                progress bar has decreased a lot. As another plus, the installer is now 150 MB smaller
                                in size.
                            </li>
<li>In one of the previous releases, launching <em>NGen</em> (The Native Image Generator)
                                for Rider binaries was broken. As a result, opening a solution in Rider took an
                                additional 8 seconds on Windows because the <em>JIT compilation</em> process needed to
                                be run at runtime. Now, we‚Äôve returned running <em>NGen</em> and won back 8
                                seconds on every solution open.
                            </li>
<li>We‚Äôve made a couple of warm startup optimizations: stopped using the ReSharper
                                engine in JavaScript/TypeScript support, and made the loading of the project model
                                asynchronous. As a result, warm startups are now significantly (up to 2x) faster.
                            </li>
<li>We‚Äôve implemented an <em>Early Backend Load</em> to speed up the loading of the
                                ReSharper language service by 3 seconds. You will notice the difference if the ‚ÄúReopen
                                last solution on startup‚Äù setting is enabled, or if you are blazingly fast and
                                able to click on a solution on the Welcome screen in less than a second.

                            It means that you will get better support of cutting edge front-end technologies and
                            frameworks ‚Äì enjoy Emmet support and advanced coding assistance for Angular, React,
                            Vue.js, and Meteor right in your Razor views.</p>
<p>Since Razor views were the last place where ReSharper web support was used, right now only
                            WebStorm engine analyzes your JavaScript and CSS. Because ReSharper-related assemblies are
                            no longer loaded when Rider is launched, both solution loading and Rider startup times have
                            become faster.</p>

                            entire solution</strong>, even with usages in C# and VB.NET projects. Rider is the first IDE
                            ever to provide this feature.</p>
<p>Besides this long-awaited Rename refactoring, F# in Rider has been given a heap of handy new
                            features in the other subsystems like
                            <em>Navigation</em> and <em>Find Usages</em>, but it is not limited to just them. You can

<h3 data-title="Code Editor update" id="v2019-1-code-editor-update">Code Editor update</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs have a quick look at the changes we‚Äôve made around the code editor. An
                            enhanced <strong>Parameter Info tooltip</strong> now shows XML documentation for the
                            selected overload, and has more colors, among other improvements. Intentions coming from
                            WebStorm and DataGrip are now first-class citizens in the Alt+Enter menu for files with
                            language injections.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Navigation_and_Search_Structural_Navigation.html"><strong>Structural
                            navigation</strong></a> from ReSharper is here to make Tab great again in Rider, too. Use
                            the <em>Tab</em> and <em>Shift+Tab</em> keys to quickly move the text selection to the next
                            or previous code element, respectively, without having to use the mouse or the cursor keys.
                        </p>
<p>The code formatter gets several very handy improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new typing assist to unindent the code when you press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> (like in
                                IntelliJ IDEA).
                            </li>
<li>An ‚ÄúExport settings to <strong>.editorconfig</strong>‚Äù button lets you store
                                code formatting settings in the EditorConfig file, so that you can share the same
                                settings with colleagues who do not use Rider.
                            </li>
<li>You can sort all using directives alphabetically, including System.</li>
<li>Sorting using directives is compatible with Visual Studio and StyleCop behavior.</li>

<p>As usual, we‚Äôve made <strong>Unity support</strong> in Rider even more outstanding:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dotTrace performance profiling</strong> for the <em>Unity editor</em>.</li>
<li>Renaming a method or property used as a Unity event handler will now also rename usages
                                inside text based scenes, assets, and prefabs.
                            </li>
<li>One-click debugging of edit mode unit tests running in the <em>Unity editor</em>.</li>
<li>Performance-critical context and indicators (introduced in Rider 2018.3) now work across
                                multiple files. Any method indirectly used from a method such as Update is now
                                highlighted.
                            </li>
<li>Improved indexing performance for Unity projects with extra folders at the root of the
                                project.
                            </li>
<li>Find in files can now search inside referenced packages.</li>
<li>Initial <em>ECS</em> support ‚Äì types and fields used implicitly by <em>ECS</em>
                                are now marked as in use.
                            </li>
<li>New inspections, such as making sure that multiplication of vectors is performed in the
                                most efficient order.
                            </li>
<li>Plus many more small improvements and fixes, such as making event function code
                                completion more robust, automatically launching the Unity editor when clicking debug,
                                and refreshing assets after getting the latest from version control and before running
                                tests.

                            you select a remote process, Rider will attach the debugger to it letting you pause
                                execution, place breakpoints, and so on.</p>
<p>In addition to remote debugging, the debugger in Rider provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brand new engine for the <strong>expression
                                evaluator</strong> under the hood, which lets you use the latest C# syntax in debugger
                                watches.
                            </li>
<li>Support for <strong>pointer operations</strong> in the <em>Watches</em> tool window,
                                including arithmetic, dereferencing and others.
                            </li>
<li>When inspecting variables, the context menu helps you switch between <code>decimal</code>
                                and <code>hexadecimal</code> for numeric values.
                            </li>

<li><strong>Zero-latency typing</strong> is here! Even for smart typing assists
                                that do long tasks like reformatting code, Rider UI won‚Äôt be
                                    blocked and the code editor stays smooth and responsive. All asynchronous
                                changes from Rider‚Äôs backend will be merged in a magical way
                                later when they are complete.
                            </li>
<li>We refactored and optimized the loading assemblies stage to speed
                                up solution loading.
                            </li>
<li>The High-contrast color theme is available.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<em>Click</em> on an entity declaration now shows usages.</li>
<li>Four new refactorings added: <em>Move to Resource</em>, <em>Inline Resource</em>, <em>Move
                                Resource</em>, and <em>Rename Resource</em>.
                            </li>
<li>You can set environment variables for executing unit tests under <em>File | Settings |

                            </li>
<li>XSLT Debugger is now available.</li>
<li>To-do color settings are finally applied to the code editor, and To-do
                                items can now be grouped by project.

<h3 data-title="Another huge update for Unity" id="v2018-3-another-huge-update-for-unity">Another huge update for Unity</h3>
<p>Our Unity support took one more giant leap in this release,
                            with some very exciting new features.</p>
<p>First, we‚Äôve <strong>introduced performance indicators</strong>. Rider will highlight
                            event functions that are called each frame, such as <em>Update</em>, <em>FixedUpdate</em>,
                            and <em>LateUpdate</em>, as well as coroutine methods.</p>
<p>Second, we‚Äôve extended our <strong>Find Usages</strong> with data pulled from Unity scenes,
                            assets, and prefabs. If you search for a class or method used as an event handler,
                            Rider will show where it‚Äôs used in your Unity files, grouped by type,
                            component name, and parent game objects. Even better, double clicking the item will
                                highlight the usage directly in the Unity Editor.</p>
<p>Pulling this information from Unity files also means that Rider will now <strong>correctly
                            highlight event handler methods as being implicitly used</strong>. We‚Äôve moved the
                            <em>implicit usage</em> highlights from the text editor gutter icons and
                            turned them into Code Vision links, so you can see at a glance what
                            classes, methods, and fields are implicitly used by Unity. And clicking the link
                            will find those usages, even inside Unity files.</p>
<p>The debugger learned more about Unity, too, and is now able to <strong>show
                            extra data for Unity objects</strong>. It can also give you data for <strong>raw
                            pointers</strong>, which is helpful for examining native containers in ECS jobs.

<h3 data-title="Debugger enhancements" id="v2018-2-debugger-enhancements">Debugger enhancements</h3>
<p>Rider now displays <em>call stacks</em> that make use of modern C# features in an understandable way,
                            including <em>generic types</em>, <em><code>async</code> function names</em>, <em>constructors, static methods</em>, and other type
                            information.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve added <em>thread-specific breakpoints</em> to simplify the debugging of multi-threaded
                            code. You can edit a breakpoint (using the context menu) and suspend only on a specific
                            thread. The breakpoint will then only be hit when it is reached in the particular thread you
                            are interested in.</p>
<p>The debugger includes a few other updates, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspecting and expanding <code>unsafe</code> pointers is supported.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2017/12/05/smart-step-debugging-rider/">Smart
                                Step Into</a> now correctly handles methods that are decorated with the <code>[DebuggerStepThrough]</code>
                                attribute.
                            </li>
<li><code>Debugger.NotifyOfCrossThreadDependency</code> is supported.</li>
<li>We‚Äôve added an option to automatically refresh all watches in the debugger tool
                                window on every debugger pause.
                            </li>
<li>Types in the <em>Memory View</em> window are now formatted in C# style instead of the CLR style
                            </li>

<h3 data-title="Publishing to IIS or FTP" id="v2018-2-publishing-to-iis-or-ftp">Publishing to IIS or FTP</h3>
<p>Rider introduces two new run configurations: <em>Publish to IIS</em> and <em>Publish to custom server</em>.
                            Both serve the purpose of deploying our <em>ASP.NET Core web application</em> to a local or remote
                            server, but they use different means to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Publish to IIS</em> uses <em>MSBuild</em> and <em>MSDeploy</em> to package and publish our application. This
                                run configuration type can deploy our <em>ASP.NET Core web application</em> to local and remote
                                <em>IIS</em> and to <em>Kudu</em> (<em>Azure Web Apps</em>), as well as create an MSDeploy package. Publish
                                profiles come as <code>.pubxml</code> files.
                            </li>
<li><em>Publish to custom server</em> uses <em>MSBuild</em> and Rider‚Äôs built-in tooling to upload our
                                application artifacts. This run configuration type supports using <em>FTP</em> and <em>FTPS/SFTP</em> to
                                get our application out there. It is supported on <em>Windows, Mac OS X</em>, and <em>Linux</em>.
                            </li>
</ul>
<p>Right now, only publishing of <em>ASP.NET Core Web projects</em> is supported. Additionally, using the
                            <em>Publish to IIS</em> run configuration type to deploy to IIS will only work <strong>on Windows</strong>.</p>

                            debugger</h3>
<p>Rider now supports debugging <em>ASP.NET Core apps</em> in a local (<em>Linux</em>) <em>Docker</em> container. Attaching
                            the debugger to a <em>Docker</em> container helps validate our application locally in a <em>Linux Docker</em>
                            container, which should closely resemble production.</p>
<p>Just like with debugging on our local machine, Rider allows inspecting variables, stack
                            frames, and threads, as well as stepping through both our own code and decompiled
                            third-party code.</p>
<p>Right now, only <em>ASP.NET Core web applications</em> may be debugged on <em>Linux Docker</em> containers.
                            While Rider allows debugging containers that are built from a <em>Dockerfile</em>, it does not yet
                            support debugging containers that are created using <em>Docker compose</em> (<em>docker-compose.yml</em>).</p>

<h3 data-title="Solution Explorer redesign" id="v2018-2-solution-explorer-redesign">Solution Explorer redesign</h3>
<p>A new <em>toolbar</em> lets us easily toggle the option to show all files, which will reveal
                            all other files that are not part of the project model (highlighted in brown). The next two
                            buttons allow us to synchronize the solution explorer and editor. <em>Autoscroll to
                                source</em> reveals the selected files in the editor, while <em>autoscroll from
                                source</em> selects files whenever we navigate from one file to another.</p>
<p><strong>Rider 2018.2</strong> introduces the <em>File-system view</em> in addition to the
                            <em>Solution view</em>, which shows the actual file-system structure underneath our solution
                            file. Items marked with no index are excluded from index-based features such as global text
                            search or todo indexes. We‚Äôve also merged the scratch view into both
                            <em>Solution </em>and<em> File-system views</em>, which makes for easier access to recently
                            created scratch files.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve added a dialog to make configuring custom file nestings a lot easier. They work
                            with <em>SDK-based</em> project files and the older format equally well, without any further
                            requirements. With <strong>Rider 2018.2</strong>, file nestings can also be applied by using
                            <em>drag &amp; drop</em> from the file that should be nested to the new parent file.</p>
<p>With the latest version, there is also an option to <em>show folders always on top</em>,
                            which may be a more natural presentation for some of us.</p>

<h3 data-title="Code completion improvements" id="v2018-2-code-completion-improvements">Code completion improvements</h3>
<p>Rider now uses <em>ReSharper‚Äôs statistics-based scoring algorithm</em> to provide code
                            completion. One of the key aspects of this is that Rider now keeps track of how many times a
                            given code suggestion was used. The more a suggestion is used, the more likely it will be to
                            show up in code completion.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve expanded code completion to several places where it would be handy to get some
                            help from Rider: <em>scratch files</em>, <em>debugger watches</em>, and <em>C#
                                Interactive</em>. Just like when writing code in a regular C# or VB.NET file, Rider
                            provides code completion as well as method info and parameter hint popups.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also added a handy feature for when you are trying to access a pointer type‚Äôs
                            members in an unsafe context and the <code>-&gt;</code> operator must be used instead of the <code>.</code>
                            (dot). To help prevent unsafe code, Rider will detect it whenever we use the wrong operator,
                            and when completing code, will use the correct one instead.</p>

<p>With each Rider release, we do our best to bridge the gap between Rider
                            and the ReSharper Ultimate bundle. The top in-demand feature has certainly
                            been <strong>Rider + dotCover</strong>; integration. In addition, <strong>Rider
                                2018.2</strong> has unit test code coverage and support for continuous testing. dotCover
                            is provided as a bundled plugin for Rider and installed along with Rider
                            automatically.</p>
<p>All critical functionality is available:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>‚ÄúClassic‚Äù unit test code coverage analysis</em> using <em>Coverage
                                Tree</em> and code highlighting. Everything looks and feels exactly the same as in <em>Visual
                                Studio</em> with <strong>ReSharper Ultimate</strong>.
                            </li>
<li><em>Continuous testing</em> in  Rider is no different from ReSharper
                                Ultimate. Simply enable it for the desired session, change the code, and build
                                or save the project (depending on the preferences).
                            </li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that <strong>only Windows</strong> is supported at this time. Support for <em>Mono</em>
                            is still a work in progress and not included in 2018.2.</p>

<p>One of the most wanted features which has been missing from ReSharper is finally added to
                            Rider. Now, you can <em>manage</em>, <em>add</em>, or <em>modify</em> <em>Live/Surround/File
                                Templates</em> right in the Rider settings under <em>Editor | Live Templates</em> and

<h3 data-title="MacBook Touch Bar support" id="v2018-2-macbook-touch-bar-support">MacBook Touch Bar support</h3>
<p>Just like the other <em>JetBrains</em> IDEs, Rider has support for the <em>MacBook Touch
                            Bar</em>. You can do lots of actions directly from the <em>Touch Bar</em>: run, build and
                            debug your project, commit changes, and update the project. The context-dependent buttons
                            are displayed in the app-specific area in the middle of the <em>Touch Bar</em> interface.
                            You can customize the <em>Touch Bar</em> contexts and buttons under the Preferences | <em>Appearance
                                &amp; Behavior | Menus and Toolbars | Touch Bar</em> page.</p>
<p>Besides this, you can make the Rider title bars darker on macOS (<em>Preferences | Appearance
                            &amp; Behavior | Appearance | </em>select<em> Use dark window headers</em>).</p>
<p>Additionally, Rider also comes with brand new icons. The main goal of these new cleaner,
                            simpler icons is to reduce visual mess and increase the readability of the toolbar and tool
                            windows.</p>

</ul>
<p>Besides supporting the syntax, we‚Äôve added new inspections and appropriate quick-fixes

                            with ReSpeller</h3>
<p>This release comes with the <em>ReSpeller </em>extension to provide spell-checking
                            functionality out of the box. Just like with code analysis, <em>ReSpeller </em>scans for
                            spelling mistakes and typos in <em>identifiers</em>, <em>comments</em>, <em>string
                                literals</em>, and more, and provides quick-fixes to resolve each detected problem. By
                            default, <em>ReSpeller </em>is enabled for many of the languages Rider supports. A simple
                            way to enable/disable individual inspections and change the severity of what it detects is
                            to search for ‚Äútypo‚Äù in the settings (you‚Äôll end up in <em>Preferences |
                                Editor | Inspection Settings | Inspection Severity</em>).</p>
<p>We can then invoke the <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> menu where <em>ReSpeller </em>gives us several
                            options to fix our mistakes. In the menu, we can either fix the typo or add a new word to
                            <em>ReSpeller‚Äôs </em>dictionary.</p>
<p>By default, the spell checker comes with a built-in dictionary for English (United States).
                            It uses a dictionary based on <a href="http://hunspell.github.io/"><em>Hunspell</em></a>,
                            which means you can install <a href="https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries">additional
                                languages</a> if you like.</p>

<li>Discovering and running tests in <em>SDK-styled</em> projects has become faster.</li>
<li>A new <em>lock/unlock</em> icon has been added to <em>Unit Test Session</em> toolbar,
                                now you can lock a <em>Unit Test session</em> to prevent adding more tests.
                            </li>
<li>Run and debug tests are now possible even on <em>Mono</em> on <em>Windows</em>.</li>
<li>It is possible to open the <em>Unit Test Explorer </em>window from the <em>Navigate
                                To</em> menu

<p><em>NuGet</em> support in <strong>Rider 2018.2</strong> includes filter and format
                            customization in <em>NuGet</em> logs, and advanced diagnostics which will help you to
                            understand what happened if something with a <em>NuGet</em> package went wrong. </p>
<p>As well as this, we‚Äôve added support for the <em>AutoReferenced</em> packages and <em>TLS-1.2-only</em>
                            NuGet feeds.</p>
<p>Support for <em>project.json-based</em> projects has been discontinued since such kinds of
                            projects are quite outdated and we think it is time for us to move forward. </p>

                            menu is available for projects and assemblies. It does exactly what it says: references the
                            selected project or assembly in <em>C# Interactive</em>. <strong>Rider</strong> will
                            generate the load statement for us and execute it at once. The <em>C# Interactive</em> tool
                            window also comes with its own toolbar button to help reference projects in the current
                            solution.</p>
<p><strong>Rider</strong> now supports attaching the debugger to <em>C# Interactive</em> and
                            steps through our own code when invoked from <em>C# Interactive</em>. No more need to write
                            a console application or a unit test to quickly debug a snippet of code. All we have to do
                            is reference our project and start debugging it with <em>C# Interactive</em>!</p>

<h3 data-title="Unity support" title="Unity support" id="v2018-2-unity-support">Improvements in Unity support</h3>
<p>Outstanding <em>Unity</em> support in Rider becomes even more outstanding! </p>
<p>We‚Äôve introduced full support for <em>Unity Assembly Definition Files</em>
                            (<code>.asmdef</code>): <em>JSON</em> schema validation, code completion, <em>Find Usages</em>,
                            <em>Rename</em> refactoring, <em>Navigation</em> on references elements, <em>AsmDef</em>
                            file templates, and inspections/quick-fixes for self-reference and file name/assembly name
                            mismatch. Also, Rider now supports <em>Roslyn C# compiler response</em> files
                            (<code>csc.rsp</code>)</p>
<p>We‚Äôve added an option to disable <em>Unity Reload Assembles</em> when <em>Unity</em>
                            receives focus in <em>Play mode</em> (only for Unity prior to 2018.2, as 2018.2 has the same
                            option natively).</p>
<p>From now on, you can open a <em>Unity Editor/Player </em>log directly in Rider, and here you
                            have the actions available to filter and collapse similar log entries. All commands are
                            available under the cog menu in the <em>Unity Log</em> tool window</p>
<p><em>Code Analysis</em> has been significantly improved. There are lots of new inspections and
                            appropriate quick fixes to improve your <em>Unity</em> code, and we have made a bunch of
                            bug-fixes, most notable of which is the invalid warning for <em>this == null</em> in <em>Unity</em>
                            types.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, support for debugging remote players has been improved, and <em>Packages </em>and
                            <em>Scratches </em>nodes have been added to <em>Unity Explorer.</em></p>

<p>Rider provides over 2400 code inspections in all supported languages to help you detect
                            errors and code smells. In this release cycle, we have added even more power to improve your
                            code quality ‚Äì with Roslyn analyzers. If you have Roslyn analyzers installed in your projects
                            via NuGet or <code>.csproj</code> references, Rider will highlight them in the editor and let you
                            apply quick actions (if available) via the <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> menu.</p>
<p>Support for Roslyn analyzers is enabled and included in <em>Solution-Wide Analysis</em> by
                            default. Related settings can be configured under <em>Editor | Inspection Settings | Roslyn
                                Analyzers</em>. All analyzers have configurable severity levels, which can
                            be adjusted to your needs via a context menu or the <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> popup.
                            The light bulb in the gutter will show the Roslyn logo so you can distinguish between
                            Roslyn's and Rider's code analysis.</p>

<p>Rider's support for Unity gets better with every release. In this release cycle,
                            we've focused on reducing the time you spend on context switching between Rider and Unity
                            Editor.</p>
<p>You can now switch into and out of <em>Play mode</em>,
                            and pause and step a single frame without leaving Rider! A new toolbar includes game view
                            buttons <em>Play</em>, <em>Pause</em>, and <em>Step</em>, which correspond to the same
                            buttons in Unity Editor and
                            control the same behavior as Unity Editor does. A new small Unity icon in the status bar
                            will indicate whether Unity Editor is connected, refreshing, or in <em>Play mode</em>. Any
                            changes
                            applied in Rider in <em>Edit mode</em> will be instantly delivered to Unity Editor.</p>
<p>The new <em>Unity Logs</em> tool window with hyperlinked stack traces lets you explore the
                            same events that are logged in the Unity Editor console. It allows filtering by category (error,
                            warning, or message), hides events based on when they were logged (in <em>Play</em> or <em>Edit
                                mode</em>),
                            and lets you easily navigate to any source file, class, method, or property mentioned in the
                            log entry. Unity Logs cleans its output automatically after every switch to <em>Play
                                mode</em>.</p>
<p>Rider 2018.1 also provides seamless integration with Unity Test Runner. Explore the results of
                            your Unity-specific tests, filter by result, and click on stack traces to navigate to your
                            code ‚Äî all from within Rider.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we've added a <em>Unity Explorer</em> view that duplicates
                            Unity Editor's view of assets, to make you feel right at home.</p>

<p><em>XAML Preview</em> settings are available under <em>Tools | XAML Preview</em>. It is
                            possible to turn the

<div>
<h3 data-title="Memory view in debugger" id="v2018-1-memory-view-in-debugger">Memory view in debugger</h3>
<p>A new debugger feature called <em>Memory View</em> allows you to look under the hood of an
                            application and explore the managed heap while debugging, to understand the effect of code
                            on the application's memory space.</p>
<p>When the debugger hits a breakpoint, you can open the <em>Memory View</em> in a separate tab
                            of the <em>Debugger</em> tool window. Rider will show the total number of objects in the heap,
                            grouped by
                            type name and bytes consumed. Double click on a class item to see all instances in a
                            separate window. You can also get there from the code editor by hitting <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd>
                            on any class declaration and selecting <em>Show instances of class</em>.</p>
<p><em>Memory View</em> works with the full .NET Framework (4.5+) as well as .NET Core. Mono is
                            not supported yet.</p>

<h3 data-title="More debugger updates" id="v2018-1-more-debugger-updates">More debugger updates</h3>
<p>Debugging in Rider gets quite a few more lovely improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring exception details gets easier with the new <strong>exception popup</strong>.
                                It&nbsp;shows basic information about a thrown exception and helps you quickly
                                navigate through the highlighted stack traces of the exception. In addition, you can
                                change exception breakpoint settings right inside the popup.
                            </li>
<li><em>Smart Step Into</em> has been combined with <em>Jump to Statement</em>, which means
                                that <strong>already executed calls can be executed again</strong>.
                            </li>
<li><strong>Symbol server support</strong> allows you to configure the behavior of symbols
                                and symbol
                                servers. Set this up in <em>Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger | Symbols</em>.
                            </li>
<li>Rider learns to <strong>display the source code for return value locals</strong> in the
                                <em>Variables</em> view (a.k.a "locals") of the <em>Debug</em> tool window.
                            </li>
<li>Debugger's <em>Attach</em> window <strong>displays process names and IDs and suggests
                                elevating
                                permissions</strong> when elevation is required. (<em>Note: right now this works only
                                for .NET Framework on Windows</em>.)
                            </li>
<li>Attaching to local process gets faster.
                            </li>

<h3 data-title="NuGet improvements" id="v2018-1-nuget-improvements">NuGet improvements</h3>
<p>We've improved support for authenticating against <strong>private NuGet feeds</strong>
                            in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the first load of the solution where package restore is required, Rider now
                                automatically displays an authentication prompt and stores credentials in Rider's
                                password store.
                            </li>
<li>Rider 2018.1 also comes with built-in credential providers for popular NuGet hosting
                                solutions such as <a href="https://www.myget.org/%3E">MyGet</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/package/overview">Visual Studio Team
                                    Services (VSTS)</a>.
                            </li>
<li>You can also add a custom credential provider. We have published
                                <a href="https://github.com/maartenba/rider-pugin-credentialprovider-sample">an example
                                    of NuGet credential provider plugin for Rider on GitHub</a> in case you want to
                                create your own.
                            </li>
</ul>
<p>In a related change, we've added initial support for <strong>bulk NuGet operations</strong>. You can
                            update all packages in solution with a click of a new button on the toolbar in
                            the <em>NuGet Packages</em> tab. It is also possible to update any installed package for all
                            or several projects up to a required version, as well as remove it in one click.</p>

<p>In this release, Rider has learned to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let you develop and build full .NET framework applications without an existing Visual Studio
                                or Visual Studio Build Tools installation on a Windows machine using <a href="https://download.jetbrains.com/resharper/MSBuild.zip">JetBrains
                                    redistributable of MSBuild</a>. You can specify the <em>Custom</em> MSBuild under
                                <em>Build,
                                    Execution, Deployment | Toolset and Build | Use MSBuild version</em>.
                            </li>
<li>Support Web References: view web references in the <em>Solution Explorer</em>, discover
                                and add WCF web references by URL, and remove existing web references.
                            </li>
<li>Open and run Web Site projects with full support, including navigation, refactoring,
                                code analysis, and so on.
                            </li>
<li>Provide UI for editing project properties in .NET Core solutions.</li>
<li>Discover and auto-detect MSBuild more accurately.</li>

<h3 data-title="Evolving F# support" id="v2018-1-evolving-f-support">Evolving F# support</h3>
<p>In F# projects, files are now arranged in
                            <strong>dependency order</strong>, and you can drag-and-drop to reorder files in
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em>. File re-ordering works for multiple files, so you can also
                            move files before or after an existing directory.</p>
<p>F# scripting has been improved, too:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Code Completion</em>, highlighting, and analysis work as expected.</li>
<li>Navigation commands such as <em>Search Everywhere</em>, <em>Go to
                                Symbol</em>, <em>Go to File Member</em>, <em>Find Usages</em>,
                                and <em>Viewing File Structure</em> all support scripts.
                            </li>
<li><em>Smart Code Completion</em> for files in <code>#r</code> and <code>#load</code>
                                directives provides all the applicable files from subdirectories and inserts the
                                relative path.

<p>Rider doesn't forget about its roots and continues in the footsteps of its big brother,
                            ReSharper. The list of features adopted from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/whatsnew/">ReSharper 2018.1</a> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full understanding of <strong>C# 7.2</strong> and improved support for previous C#
                                versions.
                            </li>
<li>Using <strong>EditorConfig</strong> to set inspection severities for any scope:
                                solution, project, or a specific file. Use the option <em>Read
                                    settings from editorconfig</em> and project settings available under <em>Settings |
                                    Inspection
                                    Settings | Enable Code analysis</em>.
                            </li>
<li><strong>Code formatting inspections</strong>: Rider can now highlight code formatting
                                violations right in the editor as you code. Not everyone is a fan of
                                this behavior, which is why these inspections are disabled by
                                default; to turn some or all of them on, go to <em>Editor | Inspection Settings | Inspection
                                    Severity</em>.
                            </li>
<li><strong>StyleCop support</strong> configurable under <em>Editor | Code Style |
                                StyleCop</em>. Note that StyleCop configuration may override Rider's own code style settings.

<p>Rider continues to expand the functionality that it inherits from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/?fromMenu">WebStorm</a> and provides out
                            of the box.</p>
<p>This update supports the latest <strong>TypeScript 2.7</strong> features, improves the <em>Implement
                            Members
                            action</em>, and adds a new <em>Surround with type guard</em> quick-fix for unresolved
                            properties.
                        </p>
<p>Courtesy of our great colleagues on the WebStorm team, configuring package managers in Rider
                            is now much easier. In Node.js and npm preferences, you can select between npm and Yarn
                            and then have Rider use the preference when installing dependencies and running scripts. If you open a new project with a
                            <code>yarn.lock</code> file, Rider will use Yarn in it if it's installed.</p>
<p>The <em>Rename</em> refactoring for classes now offers renaming a file if it has the same
                            name as the
                            class.</p>
<p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>-click on a class name in HTML will navigate to its declaration
                            in Sass, SCSS, or Less source code. In addition, code completion will suggest classes and IDs from all style sheets
                            if there are no matching symbols in the linked CSS file.

<p>Everyone knows that small commits make it easier to review and track changes, and roll them
                            back if something went wrong. <strong>Partial Git commits</strong> (<code>git add -p</code>)
                            let you easily commit only selected changes from a file. Use checkboxes in the diff
                            view of the <em>Commit Changes</em> dialog to select chunks of code you want to commit.
                            Also, change markers in the left gutter let you move a change to any existing changelist
                            or create a new one.</p>
<p>There's now a new <em>Group by</em> icon available in the <em>Local Changes</em> tab in the
                            <em>Version Control</em>
                            tool window, which allows you to group local changes by their directory, module, or
                            repository.</p>
<p>In addition, Rider now highlights hashes in the commit details, and allows you to one-click
                            jump to this commit in the <em>Log</em> tab.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>Abort Rebase</em>, <em>Continue Rebase</em>, and <em>Skip Commit</em> actions are now
                            available from the <em>Git Branches</em> pop-up.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you want to debug an assembly that you don't own source code for: a&nbsp;control
                            library or a legacy module that doesn't quite work as expected. Other times, you just want
                            to know better how the .NET Framework operates.</p>
<p>Rider 2017.3 makes debugging external code an automatic, pain-free process. You can now
                            <strong>step through and set breakpoints in assemblies that Rider decompiles
                                on-the-fly</strong>. Rider
                            already had both a .NET debugger and a .NET decompiler inside, we just had to make them
                            interoperate seamlessly, which we did.</p>
<p>Whenever you're only interested in debugging your own code, you can change debugger settings
                            to make it step over any library calls.</p>

<p>Debugging method chains and nested method calls gets way easier with a new debugger action,
                            <em>Smart Step Into</em>.</p>
<p>The action helps you choose a particular call to step into, while stepping over all other
                            calls in a line. For example, when debugging a line like <code>Print(Filter(people,
                                BuildPredicate(x =&gt; x.Feature, "smth")));</code>, you can pick to specifically step into
                            <code>Filter()</code>.
                        </p>

<h3 data-title="Return values in locals" id="v2017-3-return-values-in-locals">Return values in locals</h3>
<p>Following popular demand, Rider learns to display function return values in the
                            <span>Variables</span> view (a.k.a "locals") of the <span>Debug</span>
                            tool window as you step through your code.</p>
<p>This is useful when the result of a method call is not stored in a local variable, for
                            example when the method returns another method's return value, or when using method
                            chaining.</p>

<p>Debugging in Rider has improved in many other ways, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now <strong>drag-and-drop the execution pointer</strong>
                                to an earlier or later location in code,
                                letting you retry or skip certain logic without having to restart the application.
                            </li>
<li>Callers of async functions are now displayed in the
                                <span>Frames</span> view, restoring the <strong>async
                                    causality chain</strong>.
                            </li>
<li>Debugger actions like <em>Force Run To Cursor</em> and <em>Set Next Statement</em>
                                are now <strong>available via <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd></strong>
                                during debugging sessions.
                            </li>
<li>Code completion items in <span>Variables</span>
                                and <span>Watches</span> views get a refreshed presentation.
                            </li>
<li>Lambda expressions and extension methods are now supported when you debug Mono-based
                                applications such as Xamarin or Unity.
                            </li>
<li>Values of numeric types ‚Äî <code>decimal</code>, <code>float</code>,
                                <code>double</code> ‚Äî
                                are now evaluated and presented as expected.

<p>Rider's UI for creating projects and solutions has been improved in many ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project templates are now grouped by framework, with languages, flavors and target
                                framework
                                versions selectable in properties of each framework template.
                            </li>
<li>Git or Mercurial repositories can be created along with new solutions.</li>
<li>You can search the wizard for a particular type of application or programming
                                language.
                            </li>
<li>More project templates are available by default, such as WPF Application and Unity Class
                                Library.
                            </li>
<li>Additional project templates based on <code>dotnet&nbsp;new</code> can be easily
                                installed.

<p>Rider's .NET unit test runner gets a serious usability boost, as well as a set of new
                            functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two new actions are available: <em>Repeat Tests Until Failure</em>
                                and <em>Rerun Failed Tests In Current Session</em>.
                            </li>
<li>All actions now respect the currently selected filter (such as
                                <em>Failed tests only</em>). Filters themselves are now presented in a more compact
                                manner: if a test status doesn't occur in the current test session, the filter for that
                                status is not displayed.
                            </li>
<li>Local shortcuts for unit test trees are introduced: for example, <kbd>Del</kbd>
                                removes selected tests from a session, and <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>Insert</kbd> creates a new
                                session.
                            </li>
<li>When you search for tests in the unit test tree, you can now find results in collapsed
                                nodes.
                            </li>

<p>In addition to the new Unity Class Library project template mentioned above, the Unity plugin
                            receives an array of all-around improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>New <strong>context actions</strong>
                                to annotate fields as serializable or not serializable, as well as to convert
                                auto-properties to properties with serialized backing fields.
                            </li>
<li>New <strong>code inspections</strong>
                                around Unity attributes, such as signature checks in methods marked with <code>[PostProcessScene]</code>
                                and other Unity attributes.
                            </li>
<li><strong>Code completion</strong> starts to show Unity event functions at the top
                                of the list, and works again before attributed fields.
                            </li>
<li>Syntax highlighting and coding assistance are available in <strong>compute
                                shaders</strong> in addition to regular shaders.
                            </li>
<li>Unity <strong>debugger</strong>
                                learns to break on user-unhandled exceptions, evaluate locals in coroutines and tasks,
                                and reliably hit breakpoints when attached to local Unity processes. <em>pdb2mdb</em>
                                is now integrated to enable the Mono debugger to handle assemblies that come with
                                Windows-specific PDB files.
                            </li>
<li><em>Quick Documentation</em> pop-up provides links to <strong>external
                                documentation</strong> for Unity symbols.

<p>Rider learns to execute <em>Web.config</em> and <em>App.config</em>
                            transformations that are commonly used to modify settings when packaging applications.</p>
<p>From the context menu, you can add a transformation, select a configuration that it is
                            applied to (Debug or Release), and choose whether you want the resulting transform file to
                            be nested under its parent in Solution Explorer.</p>

                            include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reworked <strong>Extract Method</strong> refactoring that supports returning tuples
                                instead of out parameters when you're using C#&nbsp;7.
                            </li>
<li>New <strong>C# typing assists</strong> to add multiline comments, indent methods in
                                chains, and surround code selections.
                            </li>
<li>Support for tuples and documentation inheritance via <code>&lt;inheritdoc/&gt;</code> in
                                <strong>VB.NET</strong>.

                            development features</h3>
<p>Rider continues to expand the set of <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm">WebStorm</a> functionality that it
                            provides out of the box.</p>
<p>This release bundles a set of plugins for frontend developers that
                            were formerly only available on demand, and weren't easily discoverable. This set of
                            plugins includes support for TSLint, CoffeeScript, LiveEdit, Polymer and web components, Pug
                            (ex. Jade), Handlebars, Karma, Stylus, AngularJS, spy-js, Gherkin, and Cucumber. (In related
                            news, Vagrant plugin is now also available by default.)
                        </p>
<p>Thanks to recent updates made by the WebStorm team, support for JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS
                            and
                            Vue.js gets a boost as well, and a preview panel is now available whenever you edit SVG
                            files.</p>
<p>Finally, we have improved detection of <em>package.json</em>
                            files in projects, which lets Rider suggest installing or updating <em>npm</em>
                            packages in more cases.</p>

<h3 data-title="MSBuild and NuGet" id="v2017-3-msbuild-and-nuget">MSBuild and NuGet</h3>
<p>Rider's NuGet tooling learns to handle fallback folders, restore packages based on
                            <code>PackageReference</code> directives in <em>.csproj</em> files, and ignore disabled
                            NuGet package sources.</p>
<p>Speaking of its project system, Rider now provides UI to edit .NET Core project properties,
                            and
                            applies additional heuristics when dealing with linked files: it lets you choose between
                            copying, moving files and adding links to them when you add an existing item, and suggests
                            to exclude linked files from a project instead of deleting them from file system.</p>
<p>In a related change, we have enabled IntelliSense in .NET Core project files.</p>

<p>Rider continues to take full advantage of its IntelliJ platform roots. In this release cycle,
                            changes inherited from
                            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Editor-based REST client</strong> based on scratch files with the <em>.http</em>
                                extension. (The UI-based version of the REST client continues to be available, and even
                                gets a few cosmetic updates.)
                            </li>
<li><strong>Version control</strong> updates including interactive rebase from Git log,
                                preserving workspaces when switching between branches,
                                and improved handling of Git and Mercurial merge commits.
                            </li>
<li><strong>Database updates</strong>: grouping data sources, XQuery/XPath coding assistance
                                in
                                <em>.sql</em> files via language injections, and more.
                            </li>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>
                                support updates, most importantly revised Docker run configurations.

<h3 data-title="Settings" id="v2017-3-settings">Settings</h3>
<p>Rider's settings have been reworked in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now reliably export and import Rider settings via
                                <span>Import Settings</span>,
                                <span>Export Settings</span>
                                and <span>Manage Layers</span> dialogs.
                            </li>
<li>C# code style settings were extended with a
                                <span>Null Checking</span> tab that helps choose a default null
                                checking style in code that Rider generates for you.
                            </li>
<li>Inspection severity configuration is now separated into per-language pages.</li>
<li>A new page with JetBrains Annotations settings was added under <span>Inspection
                                Settings</span>.
                            </li>

<h3 data-title="Even more changes" id="v2017-3-even-more-changes">Even more changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find Usages</strong> learns to work asynchronously to show available results
                                while a search is still running, and offers a new grouping by usage type.
                            </li>
<li>We have introduced a new <strong>Xcode keymap</strong> for long-time Mac users.
                            </li>
<li><strong>Designer files</strong> are now automatically regenerated on saving the
                                associated <em>.resx</em> files.
                            </li>
<li>
<strong>Context menu</strong> on <em>Solution Explorer</em>
                                nodes has been restructured for a clearer, more compact presentation of actions.
                            </li>
<li><strong>JetBrains annotations</strong>
                                were ported to .NET Core, which makes entire categories of code inspections
                                (nullability, LINQ, purity inspections) work more reliably.
                            </li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<h3 data-title="Performance" title="Performance" id="v2017-3-performance">Performance improvements</h3>
<p>We have improved performance in many aspects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loading and reloading projects</strong>: thanks to a new asynchronous handling
                                of MSBuild tasks, the synchronization stage of loading projects is now up to 5 times
                                faster on large solutions that we used for testing.
                            </li>
<li><strong>Code completion</strong> performs faster on huge solutions.</li>
<li>In terms of <strong>debugging</strong>, the debugger launch time in some scenarios has
                                been optimized, as well as rendering of large call stacks.
                            </li>

<h3 data-title="Call and value tracking" id="v2017-2-call-and-value-tracking">Call and value tracking</h3>
<p>We've implemented some of the most insightful features that
                            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a> has to offer: <em>Call Tracking</em>
                            and <em>Value Tracking</em>.</p>
<p>Where does this value come from? Where is this value used? What are the call trees that this
                            method is involved in? Using the new <strong>Inspect This</strong>
                            action (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>A</kbd>) in Rider, you can now figure this out. On member and
                            parameter
                            declarations, <em>Call Tracking</em> and <em>Value Tracking</em>
                            actions are even directly available from the <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> menu.</p>

<h3 data-title="MSTest support" id="v2017-2-mstest-support">MSTest support</h3>
<p>Rider's unit test runner already supported running and debugging xUnit and NUnit tests. With
                            Rider 2017.2, based on popular demand, we are adding MSTest to the list of supported
                            frameworks. This includes classic MSTest (a.k.a Visual Studio Testing Framework) as well as
                            the emerging cross-platform <span>MSTest V2.</span>
</p>
<p>MSTest V2 will work out of the box on Windows, Mac or Linux. As to classic MSTest, due to the
                            way it's licensed, you need to have a <span>Visual Studio</span>
                            instance installed on your machine in order to run classic MSTest-based tests in Rider.
                            The path to <span>Visual Studio</span> needs to be configured
                            in Rider settings under
                            <span>Build, Execution, Deployment | Unit Testing | MSTest</span>.</p>

<div>
<h3 data-title="Open folder or file" id="v2017-2-open-folder-or-file">Open folder or file</h3>
<p>Not all code is in a solution or project. With that in mind, we added a command to open an
                            individual file or folder from the Rider start screen and the
                            <span>File | Open</span> menu.</p>
<p>When you open a file or folder, you can use a lot of Rider features, including
                            HTML/JavaScript/TypeScript support, version control,
                            <em>Go to File</em>, <em>Search Everywhere</em>, as well as

<div>
<h3 data-title="Attach folder to solution" id="v2017-2-attach-folder-to-solution">Attach folder to solution</h3>
<p>Along with opening folders or files, Rider can now do something extra: attach any folder to a
                            solution. This doesn't modify any project or solution files; instead, it simply makes the
                            folder
                            visible in <em>Solution Explorer</em> alongside your current solution.</p>
<p>This can be useful if you're working with a web application that has distinct frontend and
                            backend parts, and they're maintained in separate repositories. In this case, attaching the
                            frontend part to your .NET backend solution will let you edit both parts in Rider, without
                            integrating the frontend into your solution structure.</p>

<h3 data-title="Debugger updates" title="Debugger updates" id="v2017-2-debugger-updates">Parallel stacks, lambda evaluation <span>and more debugger updates</span>
</h3>
<p>The <span>Debug</span> tool window gets a new tab:
                            <strong>Parallel Stacks</strong>. When debugging multithreaded
                            applications, it lets us visualize the various threads that are active while debugging, as
                            well as their call stack. Hovering over a thread displays all child threads. From the
                            toolbar, you can jump to the active frame. Double-clicking an entry in the call stack will
                            jump to source. And when stepping through code, the diagram will be updated depending on
                            threads that are being started/joined.</p>
<p>Rider's debugger now lets you add <strong>lambda
                            expressions as watches</strong>. The debugger will evaluate and execute the expression,
                            visualizing the results.</p>
<p>When debugging applications that have lots of variables, you may want to <strong>mark
                            variables</strong> with custom colors. This can now be done
                            using the context menu or with a shortcut. Marking a variable makes it really easy to
                            discover where it's used, for example in fields of other objects.</p>
<p>Finally, we enabled <strong>adding watches for nested items</strong>,
                            such as properties of a property of an object, or an element in a collection.</p>

<h3 data-title="New refactorings" id="v2017-2-new-refactorings">New refactorings</h3>
<p>We keep adding more items from the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/code_refactoring.html">broad
                            set of refactorings</a> originally available in ReSharper.</p>
<p>One of them is <strong>Transform Parameters</strong>. It lets you create a new class or
                            struct and converts parameters of the selected method into encapsulated fields of the newly
                            created type. After applying the refactoring, usages of parameters are converted into usages
                            of properties of the type being created. This refactoring also allows getting rid of <code>out</code>
                            parameters by introducing a tuple object return type.</p>
<p>Another new refactoring is <strong>Invert Boolean</strong>. It helps automatically invert a
                            boolean member and transform <code>true</code> to <code>false</code> and rewrite all usages
                            to invert the boolean logic.

<h3 data-title="C# 7 and more from latest ReSharper" title="C# 7 and more from latest ReSharper" id="v2017-2-c-7-and-more-from-latest-resharper">Code analysis updates from ReSharper 2017.2</h3>
<p>Rider 2017.2 comes with ReSharper 2017.2 as its engine for providing .NET support. This means
                            a number of features announced with
                            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/whatsnew">ReSharper 2017.2</a> are now available in Rider.</p>
<p>Examples include improved support for
                            <span><strong>C# 7.0</strong></span>
                            (including pattern matching and <code>out</code>
                            variables), and initial support for
                            <span><strong>C# 7.1</strong>.</span>
                            Rider now supports the <code>default</code>
                            literal, tuple projection initializers, <code>async main</code>
                            and pattern matching with generics. Simply reference the latest compiler package and make
                            sure to set the language level in your project file. By the way, Rider can also detect if
                            language features from a higher language level are used, and provide a quick-fix to make a
                            switch.</p>
<p>Rider also adds some <strong>new code inspections</strong>
                            around <code>IEnumerable</code>, and will check XML documentation inheritance to make sure
                            it is valid. This ensures documentation in the IDE as well as generated API documentation is
                            correct.</p>

<h3 data-title="Evolving F# support" id="v2017-2-evolving-f-support">Evolving F# support</h3>
<p>Rider 2017.2 comes with a series of new features and improvements around F#.</p>
<p>For example, it's now possible to work with <strong>.NET Core</strong>
                            F# projects, for both SDK 1.0 and 2.0.
                            For F# projects that use <strong>Paket</strong> instead of NuGet, Rider now disables its
                            automatic NuGet restore on loading such projects. This ensures that projects like Fable load
                            properly in Rider.</p>
<p>We've addressed a set of issues that you faced working with <strong>mixed C# and F# code
                            bases</strong>,
                            ensuring that F# code is exposed correctly in C# projects.</p>
<p>Rider now enables <strong>code folding</strong>
                            in the editor. Pretty much any multi-line expression/statement can now be folded or
                            unfolded.</p>
<p>We've also implemented the <strong>Comment with Block Comment</strong>
                            action, which comments out the current selection with <code>(*</code> and <code>*)</code>.
                        </p>
<p>Looking up the documentation never hurts when writing code, and Rider now displays <strong>XML
                            doc comments</strong> in a tooltip when hovering over documented code.</p>
<p>When you debug, Rider now supports <strong>evaluating expressions on hover</strong>, allowing
                            us to inspect a variable from within the editor.</p>

<h3 data-title="Unity development" id="v2017-2-unity-development">Unity development</h3>
<p>For game developers, we added support for <strong>debugging different Unity
                            processes</strong>. You can now create a Mono Remote configuration to remotely debug
                            standalone games, such as those running on an Android device. The IDE and debugger now also
                            support working with modularized UnityEngine dll's.</p>
<p>In other notable Unity support news, we've significantly improved our
                            <strong>ShaderLab</strong>
                            parser, which results in <strong>better code highlighting</strong>
                            in <em>.cginc</em> files and injected Cg fragments in <em>.shader</em> files. As an
                            additional nice touch, Rider now <strong>highlights color values</strong> in
                            ShaderLab files, and if you press <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd>, you can modify the color using a
                            color
                            palette picker.</p>
<p>Generating Unity code is now easier, with <strong>file templates</strong>
                            for new MonoBehaviour scripts, shaders and tests. Additionally, <strong>code completion and
                                generation</strong>
                            of event functions are now available in recent versions of Unity.</p>

<h3 data-title="Better JavaScript and TypeScript support" id="v2017-2-better-javascript-and-typescript-support">Better JavaScript and TypeScript support</h3>
<p>Courtesy of a newer version of bundled <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm">WebStorm</a>,
                            Rider 2017.2 now offers richer support for JavaScript and TypeScript:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you hover over an object while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, the <strong>inferred
                                type</strong> for the object is displayed in a tooltip.
                            </li>
<li>Reworked JavaScript <strong>code style settings</strong>
                                allow configuring how to order members of a class, such as constructors, fields and
                                methods. To apply these settings, use the
                                <span>Code | Rearrange Code</span> command.
                            </li>
<li>When using <strong>CSS modules</strong> and importing them into a JavaScript file, Rider
                                provides code completion and navigation support for class names in that module.
                            </li>
<li>Rider now detects <strong>tsconfig.json</strong> and takes it into account when
                                analyzing
                                TypeScript files.
                            </li>
<li>Code completion and navigation for <strong>Angular Material</strong> attributes is now
                                available.
                            </li>
<li>When using <strong>webpack</strong>, Rider better understands complex configurations and
                                properly resolves paths in import statements and import suggestions.
                            </li>

<h3 data-title="Version control improvements" id="v2017-2-version-control-improvements">Version control improvements</h3>
<p>When you work with Git, Rider now lets you <strong>revert and reword local commits</strong>.
                            To do this, use the context menu under the <span>Log</span> tab in the
                            <span>Version Control</span> tool window.</p>
<p>From the settings under <span>Version Control | Commit Dialog</span>,
                            you can now customize <strong>commit message rules</strong>
                            and inspections. Do you put a blank line between
                            the subject and the body? Should the maximum length of a commit message be defined? You can
                            set these and similar rules. In addition, Rider provides quick-fixes for these rules, and
                            reformatting code can also be done inside the commit message.</p>

<h3 data-title="Make changes from search results" id="v2017-2-make-changes-from-search-results">Make changes from search results</h3>
<p>In Rider 2017.2, we improved the way you work with results of a textual search using <strong>Find
                            in Path</strong> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>F</kbd>).</p>
<p>Search results from the same lines are now merged together. Also, the
                            <span>Preview</span> pane now has a left-hand gutter that displays line
                            numbers, navigation icons, context actions and local change markers. This makes it easy to
                            make small changes directly from a search!</p>

<h3 data-title="More unit testing improvements" id="v2017-2-more-unit-testing-improvements">More unit testing improvements</h3>
<p>There's more than MSTest support in terms of unit testing in this release. Here's a few more
                            highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>NUnit tests are now supported for full .NET Framework,
                                <span>.NET Core 2.0,</span> <span>and .NET Core 1.1.</span>
</li>
<li>All unit test providers now have their own settings pages where framework-specific
                                settings can be tweaked. In addition, it's possible to disable frameworks that are not
                                in use.
                            </li>
<li>We've also made performance improvements for solutions that contain large test sets,
                                as well as tests that produce a lot of output (including word wrap).

<div>
<h3 data-title="NuGet updates" id="v2017-2-nuget-updates">NuGet updates</h3>
<p>A number of updates went into Rider's NuGet client. We're now using <strong>NuGet
                            4.3</strong> under the hood,
                            which brings full support for SemVer2 and <span>.NET Core 2.0.</span>
                            Rider adds support for wildcard versions in package references, too.</p>
<p>When referencing packages that are not targeting
                            <span>.NET Core 2.0</span> (but are known to work with it),
                            the <code>AssetTargetFallback</code> property can be used to define
                            <strong>"fallback" target frameworks</strong> for project's dependencies.
                            By default, .NET Core 2.0 projects will have
                            this property set to <code>net461</code>, meaning that any NuGet package that is compatible
                            with .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher can be used without additional configuration.
                            Rider now also includes initial support for this.</p>
<p>You can now <strong>install CLI tools packages</strong>
                            right from within the NuGet client, without manually editing the
                            <em>.csproj</em> file. For example, this is useful with Entity Framework Core's database
                            migration commands from <code>Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet</code>.</p>
<p>We made some UI changes as well: for example, you can now <strong>toggle position of the
                            package details pane</strong>, which is useful if you prefer to keep the NuGet tool window
                            vertically oriented. And when possible, package icons will be rendered in high DPI
                            making everything look more crisp.</p>

<h3 data-title="Even more changes" id="v2017-2-even-more-changes">Even more changes</h3>
<p>Here's a short list of other notable changes in this Rider release:</p>
<ul>
<li>More and better <strong>code completion suggestions</strong>
                                in CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript,
                                <code>.config</code>, <code>.csproj</code> and XML files.
                            </li>
<li>Improved <strong>Multi-line completion</strong>: for instance, import completion in C#
                                is now available when you invoke code completion with multiple text carets set.
                            </li>
<li>When generating code, such as overriding or missing members, Rider now shows
                                <strong>descriptions of base members</strong> that are being overridden or implemented.
                            </li>
<li><strong>Import and export</strong> of all global settings is available, including both
                                settings coming from ReSharper and the IntelliJ platform.
                            </li>
<li>Solution-wide analysis (SWEA) is automatically paused during NuGet restore when running
                                it doesn't make a lot of sense.
                            </li>
