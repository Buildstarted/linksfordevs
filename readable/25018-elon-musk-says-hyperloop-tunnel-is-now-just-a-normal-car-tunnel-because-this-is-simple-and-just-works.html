The Boring Company’s tunneling work was <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 fFmTKR js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/888053175155949572&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/888053175155949572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closely linked to Musk’s Hyperloop idea</a></span>, which would require hundreds of miles of tunneling to be viable, although the actual test track in California bore none of the  traits of an air vacuum-based transportation system. It would have proprietary vehicles with varying capacities for private travel, public transport, or freight. They would travel along electrified skates for frictionless movement. It would be fast and efficient, but more importantly, it would be different, because he’s a genius. <br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">Six months ago, the first demonstration of that track didn’t quite match that vision: it was a Tesla Model X on a sled going down a very bumpy tunnel at roughly 50 mph.</p><aside class="inset--story branded-item branded-item--jalopnik sc-1rh3ayr-5 kIoxhb" data-commerce-source="inset"><a class="inset--story__thumb sc-1rh3ayr-2 kVzttM js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Permalink page click&quot;,&quot;Permalink page click - inset photo&quot;]]" href="https://jalopnik.com/what-the-actual-shit-was-that-1831214583" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="ynl58c-0 fcMbEd"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="64" height="64" aria-label="Jalopnik avatar" viewBox="0 0 64 64"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path fill="#FF4D00" d="M0 0h64v64H0z"></path><path fill="#FFF" d="M24.2 53H15l1.8-18h9.3c.95 0 1.8-.57 1.9-1.51L30.24 11h17.13l-2.4 24.22a24.27 24.27 0 0 1-.63 3.38s-1.91 14.23-16.7 14.32c-.7.08-2.5.08-3.45.08z"></path></g></svg></span></a></aside><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">At the time, Musk said the bumpiness <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 fFmTKR js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://la.curbed.com/2018/12/18/18147366/elon-musk-tunnel-tesla-test-opening-grimes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://la.curbed.com/2018/12/18/18147366/elon-musk-tunnel-tesla-test-opening-grimes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was only temporary</a></span>: “That bumpiness will definitely not be there down the road—it will be smooth as glass.”</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">Credit where credit’s due: it does appear to be smooth as glass now, according to a video The Boring Company released of a car going 127 mph down the tunnel. How did it achieve such miraculous speed and comfort improvements in a mere six months?</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">They paved it. </p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">Yes, for those keeping score, in a mere two years we’ve gone from a futuristic vision of electric skates zooming around a variety of vehicles in a network of underground tunnels to—and I cannot stress this enough—a very small, paved tunnel that can fit one (1) car.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">The video’s marketing conceit is that the car in the tunnel beats a car trying to go the same distance on roads. You’ll never believe this, but the car that has a dedicated right of way wins. Congratulations to The Boring Company for proving dedicated rights of way are important for speedy transportation, something transportation planners figured out roughly two centuries ago. I’m afraid for how many tunnels they’ll have to dig before they likewise acknowledge the validity of <span><a class="sc-145m8ut-0 fFmTKR js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/09/citylab-university-induced-demand/569455/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/09/citylab-university-induced-demand/569455/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">induced demand</a></span>.<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">Indeed, The Boring Company hasn’t just given up on the sleds in the test track.

But, as Curbed’s Alissa Walker has been pointing out, that plan is also for the familiar technology of cars with rubber tires in tunnels on pavement.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">Why did Musk give up on his sled dream? Why was the tunnel paved over? Here’s from the man himself:<br></p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP">To recap: Musk’s company spent two years developing a very narrow car tunnel. To anyone who ever believed Elon Musk’s bullshit: you’ve been had.</p><p class="sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP"><strong>Update 7:31 p.m.</strong>: This story has been updated to clarify The Boring Company’s relationship to Hyperloops.<br></p></div></div></div></div>
