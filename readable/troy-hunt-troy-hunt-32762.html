                    <p itemprop="description">This week I'm at Microsoft Ignite "The Tour" in Sydney with Lars Klint. I've spent most of the last couple of days doing the "hallway track" (basically just wandering around and saying "hi" to people) and doing a bunch of meetings with folks here on cyber things. I didn't mention it in the video, but there was also the Azure User Group Wednesday night and a panel here at Ignite last night so definitely keeping busy. Not too busy, mind you, and I did manage to get a couple of blog posts out this week. I'll be home on the Gold Coast from tomorrow beginning what I'm planning to be an extended "quiet period" with a lot less travel and...

                    <p itemprop="description">I don't know exactly why the recent uptick, but lately I've had a bunch of people ask me if I've tried the Brave web browser. Why they'd ask me that is much more obvious: Brave is a privacy-focused browser that nukes ads and trackers. It also has some cool built-in stuff like the ability to create a new private browsing window in Tor rather than just your classic incognito window that might ditch all your cookies and browsing history but still connect to the internet directly from your own IP address. But the thing that's really caught the attention of the people I've been speaking to is Brave Rewards which is an innovative way of simultaneously eschewing traditional ads whilst...

It's also the day the Courier-Mail here in my home state of Queensland published a piece on sharenting or as Wikipedia more accurately describes it, the practice of "sharing too much information" about your kids online. That's a worthy discussion to have on this day, although the opening paragraph started out, well... just read it: Reported in today’s Courier-Mail here in Queensland: should parents “ask their toddlers for permission before taking a photo”?

Ok, so I cheated a bit in terms of recording back in the home office, but the plugs I need to make the Zoom H6 work the way it should (and yeah, I know I said "Rode" H6 in the vid, sorry!) are on the way and hopefully they'll be all good for next week when I'm in Sydney. I'm talking about that trip in this week's update along with the Chrome 80 changes to SameSite cookies not that its hit, the Adult FriendFinder breach and then recapping on a heap of the week's news in tweets. I hope the audio (and video) improvements this week do the job, I'll do it all again from Sydney next...

                    <p itemprop="description">Well that's the audio issues fixed - mostly. The Zoom H6 is an awesome recorder, I just can't quite work out the right adaptors for the mic. I've got a couple of Saramonic SR-XLM1 lav mics and the guy at the DJ store I bought the Zoom from was convinced we'd be fine with just with 3.5mm to 6.35mm jack converters which appears to be incorrect. Someone else hen said we'd need a TRRS to TRS adaptor so we grabbed a couple of Rode SC3s which also didn't solve the problem. So, keeping in mind we have no idea what we're doing (and missing), can someone explain the gap here and what's required to fill it? In other...

I've had heaps of dramas in the past with recordings being lost and the first time I do a 3-person weekly update only 2 of them recorded (mine being the exception). I was left with a zero-byte file on my unit which we tried to recover to no avail. It's not just that; the mobile app is clunky AF (Scott was demonstrating how many times he had to mash a button on his just to get it to connect to a mic), firmware updates require an install on the PC (which at least previously, was unsigned code loaded over HTTP via an...

It's just a tad under 4 years ago that I wrote about teaching kids to code with code.org which is an amazing resource for young ones to start learning programming basics. In that post I shared a photo of my then 6-year-old son Ari holding a Lenovo Yoga 900 I gifted him as part of the Insiders program I'm involved in: He got a lot of mileage out of that machine and learned a lot about the basics of both code and using a PC. Today seemed like a good time to follow up on that post, starting with a new machine:   This one is a Lenovo Yoga C940 and for full disclosure, it came courtesy...
