An application can use the timing metrics to determine, for example, the length of time it takes to fetch a specific resource such as an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest" title="Use XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing."><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/SVG" title="The svg element is a container that defines a new coordinate system and viewport. It is used as the outermost element of any SVG document but it can also be used to embed a SVG fragment inside any SVG or HTML document."><code>&lt;SVG&gt;</code></a>, image, script, etc.).</p><p>The interface's properties create a <em>resource loading timeline</em> with <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp" title="The DOMHighResTimeStamp type is a double and is used to store a time value. The value could be a discrete point in time or the difference in time between two discrete points in time."><code>high-resolution timestamps</code></a> for network events such as redirect start and end times, fetch start, DNS lookup start and end times, response start and end times, etc. The interface also includes other properties that provide data about the size of the fetched resource as well as the <em>type</em> of resource that initiated the fetch.</p><p>This document shows the use of Resource Timing interfaces. For more details about the interfaces, including examples, see each interface's reference page and the references in the <a href="#See_also">See also</a> section.</p><p>A <em>live</em> version of the examples is available on <a rel="noopener" href="https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/performance-apis/Using_the_Resource_Timing_API.html" class="external">Github</a>, as is the <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/blob/master/performance-apis/Using_the_Resource_Timing_API.html" class="external">source code</a>.
