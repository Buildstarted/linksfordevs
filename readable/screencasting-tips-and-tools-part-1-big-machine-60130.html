<p>Just starting out screencasting? Or maybe it’s been a while? I have some tips, tricks and tools for you. I threw this video together in a bit of a hurry and the <strong>audio is a bit rougher than I’d like</strong> but I figured it would be <strong>better to have the information out there sooner</strong>. Polish can come later.</p>
<h2>This Might Work For You… Or Not</h2>
<p>I’ve been screencasting since 2004 when I started making goofy videos for a data access tool that I created called “SubSonic”. After that, when I joined Microsoft, I created a screencast series for the newly-launched ASP.NET MVC called “<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/videos/mvc-1/aspnet-mvc-storefront/">MVC Storefront</a>“. I can’t believe you can still watch these things!</p>
<p>Later on I founded a company called “Tekpub” and I recorded screencasts day in and day out. Long story short: <em>I feel like I’ve tried everything</em>. What you’re about to see in this video is what I’m doing now, which I suppose could change.</p>
<p>It’s heavily inspired by <a href="https://vuemastery.com/">Gregg Pollack’s</a> work, a person whom I respect immensely. He used to run CodeSchool and now does Vue Mastery and he is deadly with Keynote. I love the way he uses it, together with live video and code to convey the most complex topics! <a href="https://youtu.be/A9FMcsP2hmw">Here’s a great video</a> of Gregg offering his thoughts on entrepreneurship. </p>
<p>It’s a lot of work, but to me, it’s very rewarding. This approach might work for you, or maybe not. Either way I hope you find this video useful.</p>

<h2>Some Other Resources</h2>
<p>Another hero of mine is <a href="https://activegrowth.com/">Shane Melaugh</a>, the founder of Thrive Themes. He has all kinds of tips and tricks on content marketing as well as a “gear guide”. <a href="https://youtu.be/A_id3kZGghc">Here’s a great tip </a>on creating professional-looking, studio quality video with a super cheap setup.</p>
<p>If you struggle with what and how to present things, here’s the amazing <a href="https://youtu.be/FpnLCkhv-1g">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a> at Pluralsight’s Author Summit in 2014. I love his approach to telling a story – very useful stuff.</p>
<h2>Going Further</h2>
<p>Finally, if you want to see what’s possible with screencasting – <strong>the very pinnacle of excellence</strong>, look no further than <a href="https://youtu.be/fZu1XZVLE_g">Simon Allardice</a>. <em>I hate watching any video he makes</em> because he is aggravatingly, unbelievably good. His voicework is <em>perfection</em>, his pace is exact and his visual techniques make me want to cry. Just <a href="https://www.simonallardice.com/">have a look at his catalog</a> available on Lynda and Pluralsight. If you have nothing to do this weekend, <strong>here ya go</strong>.</p>
<p>I love knowing that Simon is out there… but I hate him at the same time.</p>
