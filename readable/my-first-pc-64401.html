      I bought my first PC in the Spring of 1993.  It was not the first 
      computer I bought, but it was the first useful one.  Between contract 
      engineering jobs at the time, I wanted to spend my time 
      productively by learning the increasingly-popular C++ computer 
      language.  So, I responded to a want-ad placed in the local 
      newspaper by an individual selling a several-year-old 
      personal computer clone with an 80286 CPU.</p>

   <p>Sometime in the late 1970's, the phrase "personal computer" began to 
      supersede "microcomputer" as the generic term for a computer marketed 
      to individuals.  I and many others were annoyed when IBM hijacked 
      "personal computer" and used it as the brand name of their 
      computer, as if no 
      other personal computers had existed before they created the first.  
      Today, almost all desktop and laptop personal computers are PC clones, 
      and no one has used the term "microcomputer" in decades.</p>

   <p>I drove my beaten-up Toyota pickup 20 miles North to the seller's 
      tract home in a suburb of the city.  On his dining room 
      table sat a computer in a tan rectangular metal case.  In those days, 
      computers were all about the technology, not the looks.  Just about 
      the only computers not in tan rectangular metal cases were Apple 
      computers, and they were not much more attractive.  I think the seller 
      sold computers as a side business, because I saw a couple of them 
      lined up against the wall.  The computer that I had come to buy only had 
      512 KB of memory, but I explained to the seller that I needed more to 
      run Turbo C++.  So, he opened the case and added an ISA card with six 
      more 256 KB simms of RAM.  I handed him $240 in twenty-dollar bills 
      and walked out with the computer, DOS 4.01 on 5.25 inch floppies, and 
      a monochrome amber monitor.</p>

   <p>In 1993 the sum of $240 seemed like a lot to pay for a computer that 
      old.  Younger readers must understand that, at a time when 
      CPU's were doubling in power about every 18 months, a computer that 
      was a few years old was viewed as not much more than junk.  In 
      hindsight, this was one of the best purchases I have ever made, 
      because that PC started me down a road that changed my attitude about 
      computers.  At this point in my life, computers had become headaches 
      that I was forced to endure in my job as an engineer.  Owning a PC that 
      I could use for my own purposes changed that paradigm for me and put 
      me on the road to loving computers.  My emotional attachment to 
      computers is actually more complicated than simple love.  Perhaps not 
      what I would call a love/hate relationship.  More like being in love 
      with someone with bipolar disorder.  Buying my first PC all those 
      years ago put me on the path that has ultimately led to the creation 
      of the Cheapskate's Guide website.</p>

   <p>After I brought my PC home, I went to a local bookstore and bought 
      a book called <i>Object-Oriented Programming in Turbo C++</i> by 
      Robert Lafore.  Then, I purchased a Borland Turbo C++ compiler for 
      $90 and went to work learning how to write C++ code.  I read through 
      the thick, Turbo C++ manual that came with the compiler and Lafore's 
      book and tried many of the programming problems.  A few months later, 
      I was ready for the next step.</p>

   <p>I knew the best way to learn to write code was to pick a project that 
      would take a few months to complete.  I also knew the project had to 
      be both fun and challenging enough to motivate me to stick with it.  
      So, I decided to write a graphical flight simulator.  I immediately 
      realized that I would have to upgrade my PC.</p>

   <p>To give younger readers an idea of how slow computers were in those 
      days, the ISA bus that was connected to the RAM card in my first PC 
      ran at 8 MHz.  Today's DDR4 memory runs at well over a gigahertz and 
      makes two memory transfers per clock cycle.  So, today's newer 
      computers access RAM in the neighborhood of 300 times faster than my 
      first PC.  The fastest modern CPU's are around 
      <a href="http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/linpack%20results.htm">four 
      orders of magnitude</a> faster than the 286.  Even the CPU in a 
      Raspberry Pi 3 is around three orders of magnitude faster than a 286.</p>

   <p>I had difficulty finding a 386-compatible motherboard with eight, 
      30-pin simm slots that would allow me to avoid buying new RAM.  By the 
      time 386 CPU's came out, the computer industry had begun transitioning 
      from 30 and 32-pin simms to 72-pin simms.  I finally found a local 
      computer business willing to sell me a used motherboard with the simm 
      slots I needed and a 386 SX-25 CPU for $35.  The problem of shifting 
      technologies and standards was huge, even back then, because it meant 
      that upgrading a desktop computer not only meant replacing the CPU, 
      motherboard, and RAM.  It sometimes meant buying a new hard drive, 
      internal cards, monitor, and other peripherals.</p>

   <p>Not until I removed the RAM from the 286 motherboard did I discover 
      that I had another problem.  The RAM slots on the new motherboard had two 
      banks of four simm slots each.  If I could not fill the second bank of 
      four completely, it would not work.  Unfortunately the two simms that 
      were attached directly to the 286 motherboard had actual pins soldered 
      to their contacts that fit into holes in connectors on the 286 
      motherboard.  Without those two simms, I would only be able to fill 
      one bank of simm slots on the new motherboard, resulting in only half 
      as much memory, not enough to run Turbo C++.  So, I would have to 
      de-solder the pins on those two simms before I could transfer them to 
      slots on the new motherboard.  Since I was new to computers in those 
      days, I was not 100% sure the simms would be compatible with the 386
      motherboard.  Even if they were, I assumed that I would damage them in 
      some way during the de-soldering process.  So, I was shocked when the new 
      motherboard booted up successfully and recognized all eight simms.</p>

   <p>By today's standards, my first PC had an impossibly stingy 20 MB, 
      5.25" hard drive.  I remember replacing it with a used 80 MB hard 
      drive that I bought for $85 at a local store that sold mostly used 
      computers and parts.  I was happy with that purchase, because 80 
      megabytes of space felt so roomy compared to my old hard drive.</p>

   <p>Walking along the isles of that particular computer store was like 
      panning for gold.  I never knew what treasures I might discover.  Old 
      and in some cases very old desktop computers lined bottom shelves all 
      over the store.  Today those old Vic-20's, Commodor 64's, TI-99/4A's, 
      TRS-80's, TRS-80 Color Computers, and a few that were so old that I 
      could not even identify them would be called Vintage.  But in the mid 
      1990's, they were one step away from the land-fill, too old to be 
      useful, even to me.  Used laptop computers were stacked on eye-level 
      shelves above the desktop computers.  Large cardboard boxes filled 
      with motherboards, sound cards, video cards, and other parts pulled 
      from old computers occupied the bottom shelf of one isle of the 
      store.  A shelf close to the ceiling on the east wall held a row of 
      assorted used monochrome and color CRT monitors.  The wide adoption 
      of LCD monitors by consumers was, I believe, still another five or 
      more years away.  I chose my first color VGA monitor from that shelf.  
      Its resolution was only 640x480, but that was sufficient for my needs 
      at the time.  If I remember correctly, I paid about $100 for that 
      monitor, which is coincidentally about what I paid for the 23" IPS 
      monitor that I bought from Best Buy three years ago.  I found an ISA 
      video card to interface with the VGA monitor in one of the large 
      cardboard boxes of video cards.</p>

   <p>As my flight simulator progressed, my 386 computer quickly 
      became unbearably slow.  The graphics capability of the combination 
      of the 386 CPU and ISA video card was not fast enough to produce more 
      than one or two frames per second.  I was forced to upgrade again.  
      This time, I went with a Trident PCI video card and a motherboard 
      with a 486 DX-66 CPU, which forced me to buy new 72-pin RAM.</p>

   <p>I spent a total of six months writing my flight simulator during two 
      periods of unemployment.  It went surprising well, and I learned much 
      about C++ coding, computer memory models, video memory, and 
      hardware interrupts.  Soon, I found myself looking for 
      intermediate-level C++ books, and not finding many.</p>

   <p>To make a long story short, I kept the case and power supply of my 
      first PC for 13 years as I upgraded through 4 motherboards, DOS 5.0, 
      DOS 6.11, Windows 95, and Windows 98.  Eventually, I grew tired of 
      lugging the heavy case around the country as I moved from job to job, 
      and I let go of the case and power supply.  However, I held on to the 
      original 8, 256 KB simms of RAM.  You can see them in the picture at 
      the top of this article.  Sometimes, I wish I still had that case and 
      power supply for nostalgic reasons, but as with most material things 
      that have outlived their usefulness, I could not justify keeping 
      them around.  Luckily, websites have no weight and never outlive their 
      usefulness, because they are infinitely upgradable.</p>
