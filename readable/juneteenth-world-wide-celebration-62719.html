				<b>Juneteenth 

                is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of 

                slavery in the United States.&nbsp;</b> Dating back to 1865, it was on 

                <b>June 19<sup>th</sup></b> that the Union soldiers, led by <b>Major 

                General Gordon Granger</b>, landed at <b>Galveston, Texas</b> with news 

                that the war had ended and that the <b>enslaved were now free</b>. Note 

                that this was <b>two and a half years <u>after</u></b> President 

                Lincoln’s <b>Emancipation Proclamation</b> - which had <b>become official 

                January 1, 1863</b>. The Emancipation Proclamation had little impact 

                on the Texans due to the minimal number of Union troops to 

                enforce the new <b>Executive Order</b>. However, with the <b>surrender of 

                General Lee in April of 1865</b>, and the <b>arrival of General 

                Granger’s regiment,</b> the <b>forces</b> were finally strong enough to 

                <b>influence</b> and <b>overcome the resistance. </b> </span></p>

                <p><span face="Verdana">Later 

                attempts to explain this <b>two and a half year delay</b> in the 

                receipt of this important news have yielded <b>several versions</b> 

                that have been handed down through the years. Often told is the 

                story of a messenger who was <b>murdered</b> on his way to Texas with 

                the news of freedom. Another, is that the news was <b>deliberately 

                withheld</b> by the enslavers to maintain the labor force on the 

                plantations. And still another, is that federal troops actually 

                waited for the slave owners to reap the benefits of <b>one last 

                cotton harvest </b>before going to Texas to enforce the Emancipation 

                Proclamation. All of which, or neither of these version could be true. 

				Certainly, for some, <b>President Lincoln's authority</b> over 

				the rebellious states was in question&nbsp;&nbsp; For whatever 

                the reasons, conditions in Texas <b>remained status quo</b> well beyond 

                what was statutory.</span></p>

                <span face="Verdana" color="#804000"><strong>

                General Order Number 3</strong></span></p>

                <p><span face="Verdana">One of 

                General Granger’s first orders of business was to read to the 

                people of Texas,<b> General Order Number 3 </b>which began most 

                significantly with:</span></p>

                <blockquote>

                  <p><span face="Verdana" color="#804000" size="2"><em>

                  "The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a 

                  Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all 

                  slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights 

                  and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and 

                  the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that 

                  between employer and hired laborer."</em></span></p>

                </blockquote>

                <p><span face="Verdana">The 

                <b>reactions to this profound news</b> ranged from pure <b>shock</b> to 

                immediate <b>jubilation</b>. While many lingered to learn of this new 

                employer to employee relationship, many left before these offers 

                were completely off the lips of their former 'masters' - 

                attesting to the varying conditions on the plantations and the 

                realization of freedom. <b>Even with nowhere to go</b>, many felt that 

                leaving the plantation would be their first grasp of freedom. 

                North was a logical destination and for many it represented true 

                freedom, while the <b>desire to reach family members in neighboring 

                states</b> drove the some into Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma. 

                Settling into these new areas as free men and women brought on 

                new realities and <b> <i> the challenges of establishing a 

				heretofore non-existent status for black people in America<u>.</u></i></b> Recounting 

                the memories of that great day in June of 1865 and its 

                festivities would serve as motivation as well as a release from 

                the growing pressures encountered in their new territory. The 

                celebration of <b>June 19<sup>th</sup> was coined "Juneteenth</b>" and 

                grew with more participation from descendants. <b>The Juneteenth 

                celebration was a time for reassuring each other, for praying 

                and for gathering remaining family members.</b> Juneteenth continued 

                to be highly revered in Texas decades later, with many former 

                slaves and descendants making an <b>annual pilgrimage back to 

                Galveston</b> on this date. </span></p>

                Juneteenth Festivities and Food</strong></span></p>

                <p><span face="Verdana">A range of 

                activities were provided to entertain the masses, many of which 

                continue in tradition today. <b>Rodeos</b>, <b>fishing</b>, <b>barbecuing</b> and 

                <b>baseball</b> are just a few of the typical Juneteenth activities you 

                may witness today. Juneteenth <b>almost always focused on education 

                and self improvement</b>. Thus, often <b>guest speakers </b>are brought in 

                and the elders are called upon to recount the events of the 

                past. <b>Prayer services</b> were also a major part of these 

                celebrations.</span>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><span face="Verdana">

				<b>Certain 

                foods became popular</b> and subsequently synonymous with Juneteenth 

                celebrations such as <b>strawberry soda-pop</b>. More traditional and 

                just as popular was the barbecuing, through which Juneteenth 

                participants could <b>share in the spirit </b>and aromas that their 

                ancestors - the newly emancipated African Americans, would have 

                experienced during their ceremonies. Hence, the <b>barbecue</b> pit is 

                often established as the <b>center of attention</b> at Juneteenth 

                celebrations.</span></p>

                <p><span face="Verdana">Food was 

                abundant because everyone prepared a <em>special </em>dish. 

                Meats such as lamb, pork and beef which not available everyday 

                were brought on this special occasion. A true Juneteenth 

                celebrations left visitors well satisfied and with enough 

                conversation to last until the next.</span></p>

                <p><span face="Verdana">

				<b>Dress was 

                also an important element</b> <b>in early Juneteenth customs </b>and is 

                often still taken seriously, particularly by the direct 

                descendants who can make the connection to this tradition's 

                roots. <b>During slavery there were laws on the books in many areas 

                that prohibited or limited the dressing of the enslaved</b>. During 

                the initial days of the emancipation celebrations, there are 

                accounts of former slaves<b> tossing their ragged garments</b> into 

                the creeks and rivers to <b>adorn clothing</b> taken from the 

                plantations <b>belonging to their former 'masters'. </b> </span></p>

                <p><span face="Verdana">In the early 

                years, little interest existed outside the African American 

                community in participation in the celebrations. In some cases, 

                there was <b>outwardly exhibited resistance by barring the use of 

                public property</b> <b>for the festivities.</b> Most of the festivities 

                <b>found themselves out in rural areas</b> around rivers and creeks 

                that could provide for additional activities such as <b>fishing</b>, 

                <b>horseback riding</b> and <b>barbecues</b>. <b>Often the church grounds was the 

                site for such activities.</b> Eventually, as African Americans 

                became land owners, land was donated and dedicated for these 

                festivities. One of the earliest documented land purchases in 

                the name of Juneteenth was organized by <b>Rev. Jack Yates</b>. This 

                fund-raising effort yielded $1000 and the purchase of 

                <b>Emancipation Park in Houston, Texas</b>. In <b>Mexia</b>, the local 

                Juneteenth organization purchased <b>Booker T. Washington Park</b>, 

                which had become the Juneteenth celebration site in 1898. There 

                are accounts of Juneteenth activities being interrupted and 

                halted by white landowners demanding that their laborers return 

                to work. However, it seems most allowed their workers the day 

                off and some even made donations of food and money. <b>For decades 

                these annual celebrations flourished</b>, growing continuously with 

                each passing year. In Booker T. Washington Park, as many as 

                <b>20,000 African Americans once flowed through</b> during the course 

                of a week, <b>making the celebration one of the state’s largest.</b></span></p>

                <p><span face="Verdana">

				<b>Economic and 

                cultural forces provided for a decline in Juneteenth activities</b> 

                and participants beginning in the early 1900’s. Classroom and 

                textbook education in lieu of traditional home and family-taught 

                practices stifled the interest of the youth due to <b>less emphasis 

                and detail on the activities of former slaves.</b> Classroom text 

                books proclaimed Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation of January 

                1, 1863 as the date signaling the ending of slavery - and <b>little 

                or nothing on the impact of General Granger’s arrival on June 19<sup>th</sup>.</b></span></p>

                <p><span face="Verdana">The 

                Depression forced many people off the farms and into the cities 

                to find work. In these urban environments, employers were less 

                eager to grant leaves to celebrate this date. Thus, <b>unless June 

                19<sup>th</sup> fell on a weekend</b> <b>or holiday, there were very 

                few participants available.</b> July 4<sup>th</sup> was the already 

                established Independence holiday and a rise in patriotism 

                steered more toward this celebration. </span></p>

                Rights movement of the 50’s and 60’s yielded both positive and 

                negative results for the Juneteenth celebrations</b>. While it 

                pulled many of the African American youth away and into the 

                struggle for racial equality, many linked these struggles to the 

                historical struggles of their ancestors. This was evidenced by 

                student demonstrators involved in the Atlanta civil rights 

                campaign in the early 1960’s, whom wore Juneteenth freedom 

                buttons. <b>Again in 1968, Juneteenth received another strong 

                resurgence through Poor Peoples March to Washington D.C..</b> Rev. 

                Ralph Abernathy’s call for people of all races, creeds, economic 

                levels and professions to come to Washington to show support for 

                the poor. <b>Many of these attendees returned home and initiated

                activity.</b> In fact, <b>two of the largest</b> Juneteenth celebrations
