      <div><p>Experts on the COVID-19 pandemic seem to think there are three ways out—that is, for life, health, and the economy to return roughly to normal.&nbsp;</p><p>Either we get a vaccine good enough that R0 for the world goes below 1, a good enough treatment that people no longer need to be afraid, or we develop a great culture of testing, contract tracing, masks, and isolation.</p><p>I wish that the federal government were doing much more—it would be great to see even a few percent of the recent stimulus bill go to funding R+D.&nbsp; But they don’t seem to be funding enough science, and although I think concerns about the private sector and philanthropy doing what the government is supposed to be doing are somewhat valid, there isn’t a great alternative right now.</p><p>On the positive side, I have never seen a field focused on one problem with such ferocity before.&nbsp; The response of biotech companies and research labs is amazing, and the speed they are operating at seems to have increased by more than 10x.&nbsp; It’s the best of the spirit of innovation, and it’s inspiring to see what these companies and research labs are doing.</p><p>Scientists can get us out of this.&nbsp; What they need are money and connections.</p><p>Investors and donors—this is where we can help.&nbsp; Please consider shifting some of your focus and capital to scientific efforts addressing the pandemic.&nbsp; (And future pandemics too—I think this will be a before-and-after moment in the world, and until we can defend against new viruses quickly, things are going to be different.)</p><p>The learning curve is quick, and there are a lot of experts willing to help you with diligence.&nbsp; It feels good to do something that might be useful, it’s interesting to do something totally new, and it will make you more optimistic.</p><p>If you make it known to your network that you want to fund efforts working on COVID-19, you’ll get flooded with opportunities.&nbsp; And it’s always good to invest where the best founders are congregating.</p></div>
