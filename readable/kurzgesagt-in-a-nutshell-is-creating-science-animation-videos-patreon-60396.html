<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div data-tag="summary-container"><p><strong>Hi Everybody!</strong></p><p>Five years ago we started doing videos on youtube. We did not think this would be a permanent thing, it kind of just happened. We were fresh out of college and just wanted to do some awesome stuff. Now youtube of has become our life. We brought in some of our friends to make this whole thing even more awesome. Youtube cannot sustain us, we are too many people and we invest too much time into the individual videos. What we are doing is economically, well, stupid. So we make our living doing commercial video jobs while doing as much youtube on the side as possible. Our dream would be to do content creation for you guys full time. That is what this patreon is for. By supporting us here you are not only making our lives way less stressful but you actually help us produce more content for youtube.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mFtK2Yw.png"></p><p>If you like what we are doing and consider buying some strangers over the internet the equivalent of a coffee, we would very much appreciate it. If 1% of our subscribers would do this, we could do youtube full time. </p><p>Regardless of our financial situation&nbsp;we will continue doing this whatever happens and our videos will always be free! Kurzgesagt has become something that gives us purpose and a mission.</p><p>Patreon is about frequency and quality. The more you support us the more we are able to do.</p><p>All we can promise you is that we do the best we can and invest as much time and love into youtube as possible without being irresponsible. Thank you for your ongoing support, it really is a huge deal for us and we very much appreciate it. </p><p>Philipp, Patrizia, Philip, Miri, Dani, Lizzy, Marc, Bella, Jonas, Michelle, Adam, Lara, Martin, Greta, Lukas, Tomi, Paddy, Roland, Vera, Felina, Petra, Marina, Debbie, Steve, Thomas, Fabi and Mochi</p><p><strong>What we will do with your money: </strong></p><p>- Currently we have two jobs: Kurzgesagt and our "real" jobs. By supporting us on Patreon you give us the opportunity to take less commercial jobs and focus more on youtube. Although youtube pays a little, it is not even close to sustaining ourselves. So put simply, you make our lives much easier and take stress away so we can do better and more work, for free, for you.</p><p>- We can invest more time in the videos: Youtube doesn’t like long videos. But we do – and most of you do too. </p><p>-
 We can take some  time off to work on other educational projects. For 
example, we are working on an app that explains the immune system.  </p><p>- It also will make all the bad feelings you got for using adblock on our stuff, go away. Add block absolution.</p><p><strong>Thank you so much for all your support! We appreciate it more than you can imagine and it really helps us out!</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wOdjb2z.png"></p><p>[About
