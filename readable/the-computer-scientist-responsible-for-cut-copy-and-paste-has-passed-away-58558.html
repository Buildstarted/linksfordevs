In 1973 Tesler took a job at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) where he worked until 1980. Xerox PARC is famously known for developing the mouse-driven graphical user interface we now all take for granted, and during his time at the lab Tesler worked with Tim Mott to create a word processor called Gypsy that is best known for coining the terms ‚Äúcut,‚Äù ‚Äúcopy,‚Äù and ‚Äúpaste‚Äù when it comes to commands for removing, duplicating, or repositioning chunks of text.</p><p>Xerox PARC is also well known for not capitalizing on the groundbreaking research it did in terms of personal computing, so in 1980 Tesler transitioned to Apple Computer where he worked until 1997. Over the years he held countless positions at the company including Vice President of AppleNet (Apple‚Äôs in-house local area networking system that was eventually canceled), and even served as Apple‚Äôs Chief Scientist, a position that at one time was held by Steve Wozniak, before eventually leaving the company.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to some of Apple‚Äôs most famous hardware, Tesler was also known for his efforts to make software and user interfaces more accessible. In addition to the now ubiquitous ‚Äúcut,‚Äù ‚Äúcopy,‚Äù and ‚Äúpaste‚Äù terminologies, Tesler was also an advocate for an approach to UI design known as modeless computing, which is reflected in his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.nomodes.com/Larry_Tesler_Consulting/Home.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.nomodes.com/Larry_Tesler_Consulting/Home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal website</a></span>. In essence, it ensures that user actions remain consistent throughout an operating system‚Äôs various functions and apps. When they‚Äôve opened a word processor, for instance, users now just automatically assume that hitting any of the alphanumeric keys on their keyboard will result in that character showing up on-screen at the cursor‚Äôs insertion point. But there was a time when word processors could be switched between multiple modes where typing on the keyboard would either add characters to a document or alternately allow functional commands to be entered.</p><p>There are still plenty of software applications where tools and functionality change depending on the mode they‚Äôre in (complex apps like Photoshop, for example, where various tools behave differently and perform very distinct functions) but for the most part modern operating systems like Apple‚Äôs macOS and Microsoft‚Äôs Windows have embraced user-friendliness through a less complicated modeless approach.</p><p>After leaving Apple in 1997, Tesler co-founded a company called Stagecast Software which developed applications that made it easier and more accessible for children to learn programming concepts. In 2001 he joined Amazon and eventually became the VP of Shopping Experience there, in 2005 he switched to Yahoo where he headed up that company‚Äôs user experience and design group, and then in 2008 he became a product fellow at 23andMe. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.nomodes.com/Larry_Tesler_Consulting/1997-Now.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.nomodes.com/Larry_Tesler_Consulting/1997-Now.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to his CV</a></span>, Tesler left 23andMe in 2009 and from then on mostly focused on consulting work. </p><p>While there are undoubtedly countless other contributions Tesler made to modern computing as part of his work on teams at Xerox and Apple that may never come to light, his known contributions are immense. Tesler is one of the major reasons computer moved out of research centers and into homes.</p></div></div></div>
