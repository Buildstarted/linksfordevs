        <p><strong><big>Common tracking technologies may be used on this site.</big></strong></p>

<p>We - or third parties we work with - use several common passive data collection technologies. These may include browser cookies. We or the third parties that provide ads on our site may also use web beacons, flash cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies.</p>

<p><strong><big>Tracking technologies may be used for a variety of reasons.</big></strong></p>

<p>We - or third parties acting on our behalf or on our website - may use tracking tools:</p>

<ul><li>To recognize new or past visitors.</li>
	<li>To present more personalized content.</li>
	<li>To improve our website.</li>
	<li>To serve you with interest-based or targeted advertising (see below for more on interest-based advertising).</li>
	<li>To better understand the interests of our audience and our website visitors.</li>
	<li>To observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms.</li>
</ul><p><strong><big>Interest-based advertising.</big></strong></p>

<p>Our third party advertisers may serve interest-based advertising using personal and other information gathered about you over time across multiple websites or other platforms.</p>

<p>Interest-based advertising or "online behavioral advertising" includes ads served to you after you leave a website, encouraging you to return. Interest-based advertising includes ads thought to be relevant based on your shopping habits or online activities. These ads might be served on websites or on apps. They might also be served in emails. We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads. They might be about other companies' products.</p>

<p><strong>How is relevant information about you gathered for interest-based advertising?</strong></p>

<p>To decide what is relevant to you, our third party advertisers might use information you make available to us when you interact with our site, our affiliates, and other third parties. This information is gathered using the tracking tools described above.</p>

<p><big><strong>You can control tracking tools.</strong></big></p>

<p>Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. To control flash cookies, which may be used on certain websites from time to time, you can go&nbsp;<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">here</a>. Flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.</p>

<p>If you block cookies on your browser, certain features on our sites may not work. Options you select are browser and device specific, and if you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.</p>

<p>Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.</p>

<p><big><strong>You can opt-out of online behavioral advertising.</strong></big></p>

<p>The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes.

Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.</p>
