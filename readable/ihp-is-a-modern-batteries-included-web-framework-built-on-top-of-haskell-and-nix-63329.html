                <p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</p>
                <p>
                    Itâ€™s time we talk a bit about modern web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back in the early days of the web, when server-side rendering was still a thing, javascript was sprinckled here and there to make a few parts of your web app <i>just a little bit</i> smoother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today itâ€™s different: The whole rendering logic and data management has moved into the browser. Instead of delivering readable HTML, the server is just there to send the javascript over-the-wire, which then needs to make a few api calls before displaying anything useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This comes with <a href="https://adamsilver.io/articles/the-disadvantages-of-single-page-applications/" target="_blank">lots of complexity</a>, <a href="https://javascript.works-hub.com/learn/a-javascript-free-frontend-61275" target="_blank">slow applications</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/5fphiw/modern_js_developer_workflow_makes_me_sad/" target="_blank">frustated developers</a>, and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-i-hate-your-single-page-app-f08bb4ff9134/" target="_blank">bugs</a>. It leads us to the ironic situation that javascript, an interpreted language, actually taking more time being compiled in webpack for local development than e.g. haskell, which is supposed to be slower because itâ€™s far more high-level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Somehow we have forgotten that the browser is actually pretty good at displaying HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily, in 2020 <a href="https://mxb.dev/blog/the-return-of-the-90s-web/" target="_blank">we are rediscovering</a> <a href="https://timr.co/server-side-rendering-is-a-thiel-truth" target="_blank">the power</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalyPushkar/status/1274108941333643272" target="_blank">of server side</a> <a href="https://www.gregnavis.com/articles/the-architecture-no-one-needs.html" target="_blank">rendering</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this technology shift itâ€™s time for a new, modern take on serverside web application development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With IHP we did that. Itâ€™s our new take on this. A new, modern framework to show how productive and stable serverside rendering can be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We poured together the best ideas from frontend tooling and mixed them with strong type safety, a functional programing approach, and the best package manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IHP is the result of two thoughts: highest quality software is built on solid foundations and the future of web applications is going to be strongly focused on server side rendering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Weâ€™re happy to give you an early look at it. While itâ€™s still in beta, IHP is already used in production by digitally induced and several of our friends and partners :-)

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Productive &amp; Fun:</strong>

                    IHP comes with everything you need to build great web applications out of the box. Combined with the unique mix of technologies and a fast development process, IHP makes it very pleasant to build applications.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Type-safe and reliable:</strong>

                    <p>With Haskell and Nix we use the most reliable technologies available, to make sure your application will never crash because of Null Pointer Exceptions.</p>

                    <p>If you like TypeScript, you will love IHP.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Fast dev enviroment:</strong>

                    <p>While haskell is a compiled language, the built-in dev server automatically reloads your code changes using the fastest way possible. Changes are reflected instantly. Just like good old PHP.</p>

                    <p>Watch it in action:</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Accessible:</strong>

                    Setup of the fully-managed dev environment takes just 5 minutes. All  dependencies (even database and compiler) are managed using the nix package manager. This means dependency problems just cannot occur anymore. Also everything is guaranteed to be same for all developers in your team.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>No Haskell Experience required:</strong>

                    <p>Code Generators will help you to quickly build things even when you have no professional haskell experience yet. Pick up haskell by building real world applications.</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Integrated Dev Tooling:</strong>

                    To speed up your development process, IHP comes with a full set of web
                    based dev tools. Including: a database schema designer, 
                    a web-based code generator, a web-based repl, ...

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Major Operating Systems Supported:</strong>

                    Windows (via Linux Subsystem), macOS, NixOS, Debian, Ubuntu
                </li>


                <li>
                    <strong>HSX</strong>

                    <p>Like React's JSX. Write html code in your haskell files. This will be transformed to actual type-checked haskell code at compile time.</p>

                    <img src="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/img/hsx-example.png">
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Longterm Roadmap</strong>

                    <p>Lot's of frameworks are already gone a year after launch. Especially in the fast moving JS world. But don't worry about IHP. We have been using it at digitally induced since 2017. It's actively used by us and our friends and partners. Even without external contributors we will build new features and do periodic maintaince releases in the future. We have big plans for IHP and as a profitable and independent software company we have the ability to actually execute them over the longterm.</p>
