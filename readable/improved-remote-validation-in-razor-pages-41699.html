            Remote Validation is a technique that uses client side script
        to validate user input on the server without posting the entire form.
        Remote validation has always been possible in Razor Pages using either the 
		<code>RemoteAttribute</code>, which requires an 
        MVC controller to work, or by writing custom client-side script. One almost completely overlooked feature that was
        included in ASP.NET Core 3.0 was the introduction of a Razor Pages-specific
        validation attribute that removes this reliance on MVC controllers or custom code for remote validation.

            <p>
        Remote validation in ASP.NET (Core) relies on
		<a href="https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/326/using-unobtrusive-ajax-in-razor-pages">
		Unobtrusive AJAX</a>, so you will need to install that first. The 
		easiest way to do this is via LibMan. Right click on the <em>lib</em> folder in 
		<em>wwwroot</em>, choose <strong>Add</strong> Â» <strong>Client-side Library</strong>, and then choose<em> jsdelivr</em> as 
		the source, and type in <code>jquery-ajax-unobtrusive</code>, You should see it 
		appear in the list of packages available: </p>
	<p>
        <img src="https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/images/2019-11-06_07-14-03.png" alt="Jquery Unobtrusive AJAX"></p>
    <p>
        A common use case for remote validation is to check whether a user name 
		or email address already exists in the database, if your business rules 
		do not allow duplicates.  To better focus on applying remote 
		validation, this demo features a form with just the one input. Here is an example PageModel class 
		that includes a property named<code> Email</code>:</p>
		<pre><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>RemoteValidationTestModel</span> : <span>PageModel</span>
{
    [<span>BindProperty</span>]
    <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> OnGet()
    {
 
    }
}</pre>
	<p>
        And here is a form that includes an input for the <code>Email</code> 
		property, and a
		<a href="https://www.learnrazorpages.com/razor-pages/tag-helpers/validation-message-tag-helper">
		validation tag helper</a>.</p>
		<pre><span>&lt;</span><span>form</span>  <span>method</span><span>=</span><span>"post"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>input</span> <span>asp-for</span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Email<span>"</span> <span>/&gt;</span> 
    <span>&lt;</span><span>span</span> <span>asp-validation-for</span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Email<span>"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>br</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>input</span> <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"submit"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></pre>
			<p>
        	As I mentioned before, remote validation relies on unobtrusive AJAX, 
			so you need to reference jQuery, Unobtrusive AJAX and the 
			Unobtrusive Validation library in the same page as the form. How you 
			do that depends on where else in the application you might need 
			these libraries, but the code below illustrates how to include all 
			of them in a single page within a <code>@section</code> block:</p>
			<pre><span>@section</span> scripts<span>{</span> 
    <span>&lt;</span><span>script</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>partial</span> <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"_ValidationScriptsPartial"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>script</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"~/lib/jquery-ajax-unobtrusive/dist/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
	<p>
        Now you need to add a
		<a href="https://www.learnrazorpages.com/razor-pages/handler-methods">
		handler method</a> to perform the validation. The handler method itself 
		must provide a JSON response indicating whether validation succeeded or 
		failed (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>). The following example 
		uses a named handler which is added to the same PageModel as before:</p>
		<pre><span>public</span> <span>JsonResult</span> OnPostCheckEmail()
{
    <span>var</span> existingEmails <span>=</span> <span>new</span>[] { <span>"jane@test.com"</span>, <span>"claire@test.com"</span>, <span>"dave@test.com"</span> };
    <span>var</span> valid <span>=</span> <span>!</span>existingEmails<span>.</span>Contains(Email);
    <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>JsonResult</span>(valid);
}</pre>
	<p>
        In the real world, this handler would compare the submitted email 
		address to database records, but in demo land, it checks to see if the 
		email is one of three hard coded values, returning <code>true</code> if 
		not (i.e. the email is a valid value) and <code>false</code> if it is a 
		duplicate.</p>
	<p>
        The final step is to apply the new remote validation attribute, which is 
		called a <code>PageRemoteAttribute</code>. It shares many of the same 
		properties as the MVC <code>RemoteAttribute</code>: </p>
		<table>
<colgroup>
			<col>
			<col>
		</colgroup>

			<thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
			<tbody><tr><td><code>AdditionalFields</code></td><td>A comma 
				separated list of additional fields that should be included in 
				the validation request</td></tr>
			<tr><td><code>ErrorMessage</code></td><td>The error message to be 
				displayed in the event of validation failure</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>ErrorMessageResourceName</code></td><td>The name of the Resource 
	where the error message is stored, if one is used</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>ErrorMessageResourceType</code></td><td>The type of the resource 
	used to store the error message</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>HttpMethod</code></td><td>The HTTP verb to be used for the request 
	(<code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>). Default is <code>GET</code></td></tr>
</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>The <code>PageRemote</code> attribute also includes a couple of other properties:
		<code>PageName</code> and <code>PageHandler</code>. The <code>PageName</code> is the name of the page that the request should be sent to, and the 
		<code>PageHandler</code> is the name of the handler method that should be invoked. In both cases, if they are omitted, "ambient values" will be used i.e. the current page, and whichever conventionally named handler method that responds to the HTTP verb that is used.</p>
	<p>The <code>PageRemote</code> attribute is applied to the property that needs 
	validating. In this example, the configuration of the <code>PageRemote</code> attribute 
	is as follows:</p>
	<pre>[<span>PageRemote</span>(
    ErrorMessage <span>=</span><span>"!!! Duplicate Email Address !!!"</span>, 
    AdditionalFields <span>=</span> <span>"__RequestVerificationToken"</span>, 
    HttpMethod <span>=</span><span>"post"</span>,  
    PageHandler <span>=</span><span>"CheckEmail"</span>
)]
[<span>BindProperty</span>]
<span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email { <span>get</span>; <span>set</span>; }</pre>
	<p>The handler method that performs validation is set up to respond to <code>
	POST</code> requests. It is in the same page as the property to be validated 
	so the <code>PageName</code> is omitted. The <code>AdditionalFields</code> 
	property is set to include the hidden
	<a href="https://www.learnrazorpages.com/security/request-verification">
	request verification token</a> generated by the form tag helper. If you 
	don't include this field for <code>POST</code> requests, the
	<a href="https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/336/ajax-posts-in-razor-pages-and-http-400-errors">
	request will fail with a 400 Bad Request status code</a>.</p>
	<p>And that's all there is to it. If you run the page and enter one of the 
	hardcoded email addresses, the change event fires the AJAX request and 
	validates the value:</p>

	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>The <code>PageRemote</code> attribute was introduced in ASP.NET Core 3.0 
	to no fanfare whatsoever (until now). It's a nice addition, in that it 
	removes the need for controllers in your Razor Pages application for 
	performing remote validation simply and effectively. </p>
