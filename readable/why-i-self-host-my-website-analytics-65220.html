            <p>Recently I made the switch to self-hosted analytics, after being a long-term
Google Analytics user. Almost every website you visit will have a Google
Analytics tracker on it. I think there are idealogical and technical reasons to
opt for self-hosted analytics instead.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-efficacy">Tracking efficacy</h3>
<p>This one’s quick. You’re more likely to get analytics for a given user if you’re
using self-hosted analytics, than if you’re using Google Analytics. About <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/804008/ad-blocking-reach-usage-us/">26%
of
people</a>
are running adblockers now, a large percentage of which will also block tracking
scripts, like GA. Having your analytics on <code>analytics.yourdomain.com</code> makes
your requests less likely to be blocked.</p>
<h3 id="on-principle---being-a-customer-vs-being-a-lead">On principle - being a customer vs being a lead</h3>
<p>Google Analytics (including gtag and universal analytics), has a whopping <a href="https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/web-analytics--1">73%
market share</a>. That’s millions and
millions of sites, and billions of data points processed every day. Google’s spending millions
on this service (disclaimer: that number is pulled from absolutely nowhere, but
even if 5 engineers are carrying the entirety of Google Analytics on their back
and server costs are zero, that already puts it in the millions).</p>
<p>Google, like any company, isn’t providing an expensive service for free out of
the goodness of their heart, or because they can spare the money. They’re hoping
that by being a Google Analytics customer, you’ll become an AdWords customer.
Google Analytics users aren’t customers, they’re leads. Personally I feel a lot
more secure in my transactions knowing I’m a customer.</p>
<p>There’s also the data privacy standpoint. I don’t want Google to know as much
about my website visitors as I do. Something doesn’t feel right to me about
giving Google that amount of insight into my site. With self-hosting I’m in
control of my visitors’ data.</p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>Google Analytics, for my purposes, has <em>way</em> too much complexity. I know there
are sites that benefit from the comparisons and stats you can pull up through
Google Analytics. Some website out there can probably benefit from finding out
what % of male users in Germany, who visited the marketing page
between January and March, signed up for a paid account in July. Maybe in the
future I’ll have a website receiving billions of hits per month where I could
materially benefit from such a query. But for now, I really don’t need it, and
I don’t want the complex UX that comes along with the ability to run queries
like that. All I need is a rough idea of how much traffic I’m getting, where
it’s coming from, and what pages it goes to. A simple self-hosted analytics
service gives me that.</p>
<h2 id="my-new-analytics-setup">My new analytics setup</h2>
<p>My GA-alternative of choice is <a href="https://github.com/electerious/Ackee">ackee</a>. It
took me all of 10 minutes to set up using the <a href="https://github.com/suda/ackee-chart">helm chart</a>(admittedly, longer than Google
Analytic’s 30-second copy and paste), it shows me the stats I care about in a
clean UI, it’s open-source, and it’s self-hosted.</p>
