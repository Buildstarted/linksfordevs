    <h1>r/personalfinance - Scam emails from Synchrony Bank and/or Amazon Credit Builder</h1>
    <div><div><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I received 3 emails this morning stating two things:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">A trial deposit had been made to my AMAZON CREDIT BUILDER ACCOUNT</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Action is required on my application</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Since I had never heard of Amazon Credit Builder, I called Synchrony Bank via a phone number I found on their website and verified in an email I know was legitimate from them. (I have a retail CC they manage.) The agent who answered guessed why I was calling before I said anything. She asked if I was calling about an email or text message I received this morning.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">She stated the emails were not sent by Synchrony Bank, and they are still looking into what happened (see edit1). It is unclear if all of their customers received the email, or if my account info in specific was compromised. She stated they would send an email to affected customers when they knew more.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><del>I would encourage anyone else to also call if you&apos;re unsure</del> (edited as commenters report they continue to get disconnected), but hopefully sharing these details will help calm some panic. I&apos;m open to advice below if there are more immediate steps I should take.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Edit1:</strong> Others are reporting that some Synchrony agents are saying they sent the emails, but in error. Sounds like they haven&apos;t quite gotten their customer facing message consistent yet. In any case, do not click on any links in the emails.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Edit2:</strong> Commenters are reporting various similar responses from Amazon and Synchrony. All signs currently (as of 2:30pm ET) point to this being a technical glitch on the part of Synchrony, and not a scam or phish attempt. I will update this post again if either company puts out a statement.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Edit3:</strong> While we are waiting for a statement, I wanted to share the text of the tweet that <a href="https://twitter.com/AskSynchrony/with_replies" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU">@AskSynchrony</a> is using. This is the most official thing I&apos;ve seen in writing so far:</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">&quot;Thank you for reaching out. We are aware of an unplanned customer notification that is affecting some consumers &amp; are investigating the issue. We apologize for any confusion &amp; concerns this may have caused. You do not need to take any further action at this time.&quot;</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><strong class="_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU">Edit4 - 4:35pm ET:</strong> Synchrony added the following banner to their <a href="https://www.synchrony.com/" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU">website</a>: &quot;ALERT: We apologize for any confusion an unplanned email from Sycnhrony may have caused today. No action needs to be taken at this time.&quot; (Yes, the typo is theirs.)</p></div></div><hr><h4>Page 2</h4><div></div>
