    <h1>Kids and Code: Object Orientated Programming with Code Combat</h1>
    <section class="article_text post"> <p>Geez time flies. It&apos;s just a tad under 4 years ago that I wrote about <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/kids-and-code-simple-programming-on/">teaching kids to code with code.org</a> which is an <em>amazing</em> resource for young ones to start learning programming basics. In that post I shared a photo of my then 6-year-old son Ari holding a Lenovo Yoga 900 I gifted him as part of the Insiders program I&apos;m involved in:</p><img width="500" alt="Ari Hunt with his new Yoga 900" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/62556254File-21-02-2016-17-41-213.jpg"><p>He got a lot of mileage out of that machine and learned a lot about the basics of both code and using a PC. Today seemed like a good time to follow up on that post, starting with a new machine:</p><p><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2020/01/IMG_1002.jpg" alt="Ari Hunt"></p>
<p>This one is a <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/laptops/yoga/yoga-c-series/Lenovo-Yoga-C940-14IIL/p/88YGC901221">Lenovo Yoga C940</a> and for full disclosure, it came courtesy of the same program his last one did. The 900 was a great machine but it ultimately succumbed to the sort of treatment you&apos;d expect a 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10-year-old to dish out over a period of 4 years. The new machine times well with him moving into year 5 which, for his school, is the first year that kids need to start bringing a laptop in with them. Curiously, the requirement there is for a Windows-based touch screen machine (I imagine Mac families aren&apos;t real happy about that...) which suits the Yoga just fine. Plus, it does the whole bendy flippy &quot;yoga&quot; thing so it can be used in tablet mode too (more on that later):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2020/01/IMG_0596.JPG" class="kg-image"></figure><p>Flush with good machines myself (I run a ThinkPad P1 as my primary machine and <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/lenovo-p50-and-my-dislike-of-high-dpi/">the P50 I wrote about years ago</a> as a backup), when the C940 arrived the other day I thought it was time to do an updated post. I also want to use this post as an opportunity to plug a couple of upcoming free events Ari and I will be running for kids:</p><p>They both run at the end of the day during the respective NDC conferences and they&apos;re a great way to expose kids to code. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/teach-your-kids-to-code-with-ari-in-oslo-and-london/">I wrote about this briefly when we announced the events in November</a>, let&apos;s now move on to a few of the Code Combat basics.</p><p>Firstly, get into it for free at <a href="https://codecombat.com/">codecombat.com</a>. Being browser based there&apos;s no install, no setups, no elevated privileges required etc etc. Just point and go.</p><p>Code Combat takes you through a progression of levels that gradually introduce new concepts akin to the ones we use in everyday &quot;adult&quot; programming. For example, take a look at the following screen:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2020/01/2020-01-21.jpg" class="kg-image"></figure><p>You&apos;ll see the language is set to Python and the code window represents a whole bunch of common programmatic constructs including:</p><ol><li>Comments</li><li>Variables</li><li>Data types</li><li>Methods</li><li>Arguments</li></ol><p>You can run the code as is (this is populated by default at the beginning of each level), but the objective of this particular exercise won&apos;t be met so the code will fail. You can then debug the code, modify it and re-run, just like we&apos;d do when writing software as a profession. It&apos;s somewhat gamified with heroes fighting enemies and animations that make the whole thing a lot more engaging so at least in our experience, it&apos;s something he&apos;s quite happy sitting down plugging away at for decent amounts of time without it becoming tedious.</p><p>As with most games, as you progress through the levels new concepts are introduced and the complexity increases. For example, some of the aforementioned programmatic constructs are introduced in the &quot;Defense of Plainswood&quot; level:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2020/01/2020-01-21_16-51-35.jpg" class="kg-image"></figure><p>Keep going further through the levels and more concepts are introduced, including some you&apos;ll be pretty familiar with yourself if code is your day job:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2020/01/2020-01-21_16-56-06.jpg" class="kg-image"></figure><p>So that&apos;s Code Combat in a nutshell and I&apos;d <em>highly </em>recommend getting your kids involved with it. If they&apos;re a bit younger like Ari was in that first blog post then get them on over to <a href="https://code.org/">code.org</a> but either way, give them the opportunity to code. I never push either of my kids in this direction (my 7-year-old daughter regularly uses code.org), but I&apos;ve found just a little bit of exposure has been enough to have them coming back and continually asking to do more. Clearly, they enjoy it (this vid is a good example of where the touch screen and convertibility of the Lenovo Yoga is really handy too):</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Got my 5 year old daughter coding up a storm on her school holidays, she loves it! This is on <a href="https://t.co/KRDFQU5VqA">https://t.co/KRDFQU5VqA</a> for those who are interested. <a href="https://t.co/Qk5YKuMFrO">pic.twitter.com/Qk5YKuMFrO</a></p>&#x2014; Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1011455741155164160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2018</a></blockquote> <p>That&apos;s it on the kids coding front for now, if you&apos;re in Oslo this week or London next week then do please get along to one of the NDC events, we&apos;d love to see a great turnout of parents and their kids. Who knows, it might just be the spark they need to set them on a passionate (and maybe even professional) coding journey.</p> <section class="article-open_tag"> <a class="tag" href="/tag/kids/">Kids</a> <a class="tag" href="/tag/lenovo/">Lenovo</a> </section> </section>
