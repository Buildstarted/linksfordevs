  <p><span>The pet industry is a multi-billion dollar industry. According to the <a href="https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp">American Pet Products Association</a>, $95.7 billion dollars were spent on pets in the United States alone in the year 2019, and an estimated $99 billion is expected to be spent in 2020.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That’s a huge, multi-billion dollar pie, and it’s time to carve out a big fat slice for minorities.</span></p>
<p><span>For those asking, <strong>what do dogs have to do with this?</strong> The answer is…everything!</span></p>
<p><span>Dogs are woven into the fabric of our daily lives. They protect us at airports, provide comfort at hospitals and are our closest companions. And j</span><span>ust as we saw the birding community come together after the unfortunate incident in Central Park, it’s time for the dog community to follow suit. Plus, we’ve got the best teachers right at our feet – we could all be a little more like our furry friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But first, here are a few general ideas to keep in mind moving forward.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>Educate yourself:</strong> You can find <a href="http://bit.ly/ANTIRACISMRESOURCES">anti-racism resources here</a>. Everything from books, to podcasts, documentaries, and more.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Self awareness and reflection:</strong> To better understand white supremacy and privilege and to become better allies.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Support:</strong> There are plenty of ways to show your support! Keep the conversation going, reach out to Black members of the community and <em>listen</em>. Silence is compliance.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>And <em><strong>support</strong></em> is really what this post is about. It’s important to spread the wealth, put your money where your mouth is, and support Black-owned businesses.</span></p>
<p><span>There are <strong>free ways</strong> to support Black-owned businesses too!&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Follow them on social media.</span></li>
<li><span>Interact with their social media accounts by commenting, liking, reposting or sharing.</span></li>
<li><span>Shout them out, either on your own social media pages or blog, or by telling your friends and family.</span></li>
<li><span>Write a positive review.</span></li>
<li><span>Sign up for their newsletter.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you are a <strong>dog owner</strong>, buy their products, tell your friends about them, and follow them on social. If you are a <strong>business</strong>, carry these products in your shop, or recommend their services to your clients. <strong>We can all do something.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If you know of a Black-owned, dog-related company that we haven’t listed below, <a href="https://boogiethepug.com/bark-at-us/">let us know</a>. We’ll add to the list and keep it updated.&nbsp;</span></p>

<span>When veterinarian Joe J. Owens noticed that his furry patients were getting sick because of their diet, he invented the Enjoy-A-Bowl.</span></p>
<p><span>The Enjoy-A-Bowl is the only appetite stimulation bowl on the market. It works by placing good smelling food in the bottom tray, then placing your dog’s actual food on top, using a divider to separate the two. The bottom food’s aroma stimulates your pet’s appetite, without any of the bad side effects. </span></p>
<p><span>The bowl is great for picky eaters, diabetic patients, pets on prescription diets, with pancreatitis or those managing obesity.</span></p>

<p><span>Brian Taylor has always loved dogs. What began as dog walking after work turned into The Harlem Doggie Day Spa, a dog spa owned and operated by Taylor with one brick and mortar location and another on the way. </span></p>
<p><span>The Harlem Doggie Day Spa offers pet grooming, doggie daycare, cage free boarding and pet transportation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Besides providing Harlem residents with great customer service and dog care, Taylor gives back to the community. He launched an internship program for at-risk youth, teaching them useful skills and providing jobs, and often participates in community driven efforts, like food and clothing drives and fundraisers. In 2013, he started a “No Poop Left Behind” campaign to increase the number of dog poop bag stations in the area, something all New Yorkers, dog owning or not, can appreciate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<p><span>Husband and wife team Nana and Marcus started Homescape Pets after losing their beloved Schnauzer Beau to cancer. Towards the end of Beau’s life, they knew they couldn’t save her life, but they could give her a better quality of life. That included less hard-core drugs and more of what nature provides.</span></p>
<p><span>So they buckled down in Colorado and began creating simple, all-natural, hemp &amp; CBD-based pet supplements, with an emphasis on all natural ingredients.</span></p>
<p><span>Fun fact: What’s in a name? Nana and Marcus moved 4 times in 5 years. Each time, they made their house into their little homestead, ensuring that their dogs were comfortable, plants were growing, and their surroundings were personalized. They believe that people create the landscape of their lives. Homestead + Landscape = Homescape. Perfect!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Little L’s Artisan Dog Treats was born when dog owner Lenny Forde began looking for locally-sourced, homemade dog treats that were a safe alternative to jerky for his two dogs, Lulu and Lilly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Their treats are all made in house, right in New York City, and have expanded to include things like Woofulls (dog waffles!), krumbs appetite boosters and more.</span></p>

<p><span>When Pardo Naturals founder Rita Pardo couldn’t find a product to relieve her<br>
daughter’s severe case of eczema, she took matters into her own hands. She researched natural remedies, aromatherapy and medicinal herbs, and came up with her own concoctions.</span></p>
<p><span>That was back in 2014. Today, Rita has grown her company to include everything you need to live a toxin free lifestyle, from lotions to bath bombs, dishwasher tablets and pets!</span></p>
<p><span>Check out her moisturizing paw and nose lotion bars for dry noses and paws. Great for dogs who need relief, especially in the winter time.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I’ve been a huge fan of Pet Plate since even before I saw them featured on Shark Tank.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Pet Plate is a subscription-based dog food that delivers all-natural, ready-to-eat meals, straight to your door. Their food is made with human-grade fresh ingredients and cooked in a USDA facility. Plus, you can get food personalized specifically for your pup.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Company founder Renaldo Webb started his&nbsp; career working as a consultant in the pet food space where he witnessed first hand how mass-market pet food was made. He witnessed the inferior ingredients and substandard processes, so he worked to find a healthy solution for his dog Winston.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Today, those healthy meals are shipped all across the country.&nbsp;</span></p>
