You can achieve it&nbsp;using environmental effects!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>In this article by <a href="https://twitter.com/jdegoes?lang=en">John De Goes</a> you'll see that&nbsp;environmental effects can provide&nbsp;easier&nbsp;testability without&nbsp;sacrificing teachability, abstraction, or type inference.</strong></p>



<p>'In my&nbsp;<a href="http://degoes.net/articles/zio-environment">last post</a>, I introduced&nbsp;<em>ZIO Environment</em>, which is a new feature in ZIO that bakes in a high-performance, type-safe, and fully-inferred reader effect into the ZIO data type.</p>

<p>This capability leads to a way of describing and testing effects that I call&nbsp;environmental effects. Unlike tagless-final, which is difficult to teach, difficult to abstract over, and does not infer, environmental effects are simple, abstract well, and infer completely.</p>

<p>Moreover, while proponents of tagless-final argue that tagless-final&nbsp;parametrically constrains&nbsp;effects, my&nbsp;<a href="http://degoes.net/articles/zio-environment">last post</a>&nbsp;demonstrated this is not quite correct: not only can you embed raw effects&nbsp;anywhere&nbsp;in Scala, but even without leaving&nbsp;Scalazzi&nbsp;(the purely functional subset of Scala), you can lift arbitrary effects into any '<strong>Applicative</strong>' functor.</p>

<p>The inability of tagless-final to constrain effects is more than just theoretical:</p>

<ul>
	<li>New Scala functional programmers use effect type classes like '<strong>Sync</strong>' everywhere (which are themselves lawless and serve only to embed effects), and they embed effects using lazy methods, like '<strong>defer</strong>' or '<strong>point</strong>'.</li>
	<li>Even some experienced Scala functional programmers embed effects in pure methods (for example, exceptions in the functions they pass to '<strong>map</strong>', '<strong>flatMap</strong>'), and some effect types encourage this behavior.</li>
</ul>

<div>
<p>Tagless-final can be used by a well-trained and highly-disciplined team to constrain effects, but the same can be said for many approaches,&nbsp;including environmental effects.</p>

<p>After professionally and pedagogically wrestling with these issues for several years now, Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion there are just two legitimately compelling reasons to use tagless-final:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Avoiding commitment to a specific effect type, which can be useful for library authors, but which is less useful for application developers (often itâ€™s a hinderance!);</li>
	<li>Writing testable functional code, which is fairly straightforward with tagless-final because you can just create test instances for different effect type classes.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<p>While testability is a compelling reason to&nbsp;use&nbsp;tagless-final, itâ€™s not necessarily a compelling reason to&nbsp;choose&nbsp;tagless-final over other approachesâ€”in particular, over environmental effects.</p>

<p>In this post, Iâ€™m going to show you how to use environmental effects to achieve testability. I hope to demonstrate that environmental effects provide easier and more incremental testabilityâ€”all without sacrificing teachability, abstraction, or type inference.</p>



<h3><strong>A Web App</strong></h3>

<div>
<p>Letâ€™s say we are building a web application with ZIO. Suppose the application was originally written with '<strong>Future</strong>' or perhaps some version of '<strong>IO</strong>' or '<strong>Task</strong>'.</p>

<p>Later, the application was ported to ZIOâ€™s '<strong>Task[A]</strong>', which is a type alias for '<strong>ZIO[Any, Throwable, A]</strong>'â€”representing an effect that requires no specific environment and that may fail with any '<strong>Throwable</strong>'.</p>

<p>Now letâ€™s say one of the functions in our application, called '<strong>inviteFriends</strong>', invites the friends of a given user to the application by sending them emails:</p>

<pre><code>def inviteFriends(userID: UserID): Task[List[Send]] =
  for {
    user    &lt;- DB.lookupUser(userID)
    friends &lt;- Social.getFriends(user.facebookID)
    resp    &lt;- ZIO.foreach(friends) { friend =&gt;
                 Email.invite(user, friend.email)
               }
  } yield resp</code></pre>

<p>Portions of the '<strong>Social</strong>', '<strong>DB</strong>', and '<strong>Email</strong>' objects are shown below:</p>

<pre><code>object Social {
  ...
  def getFriends(fid: FacebookID): Task[List[FacebookProfile]] = ???
  ...
}
object DB {
  ...
  def lookupUser(uid: UserID): Task[UserProfile] = ???
  ...
}
object Email {
  ...
  def invite(user: UserProfile, friend: FacebookProfile): Task[Send] = ???
  ...
}</code></pre>

<p>As currently written, our web application is not very testable. The function '<strong>inviteFriends</strong>' makes direct calls to database functions, Facebook API functions, and email service functions.</p>

<p>While we may have automated tests for our web service, because our application interacts directly with the real world, the tests are actually&nbsp;system tests, not&nbsp;unit tests. Such tests are very difficult to write, they run slowly, they randomly fail, and they test much more than our application logic.</p>

<p>We do not have time to rewrite our application, and we cannot make it testable all at once. Instead, letâ€™s try to remove dependency on the live database for the '<strong>inviteFriends</strong>' function.</p>

<p>If we succeed in doing this, we will make our test code a&nbsp;little better, and after we ship the new code, we can incrementally use the same technique to make the function&nbsp;fully&nbsp;testableâ€”fast, deterministic, and without any external dependencies.</p>



<h3><strong>Steps Toward Testability</strong></h3>

<div>
<p>To incrementally refactor '<strong>inviteFriends</strong>' to be more testable, weâ€™re going to perform the following series of refactorings:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Introduce a type alias.</li>
	<li>Introduce a module for the database.</li>
	<li>Implement a production database module.</li>
	<li>Integrate the production module.</li>
	<li>Implement a test database module.</li>
	<li>Test the '<strong>inviteFriends</strong>' function.</li>
</ol>

<div>
<p>Each of these steps will be covered in the sections that follow.</p>



<h3><strong>Introduce A Type Alias</strong></h3>

<div>
<p>To simplify the process of refactoring our application, weâ€™re going to first introduce a simple type alias that we can use in the definition of '<strong>inviteFriends</strong>' and the functions that call it:</p>

<pre><code>type Webapp[A] = Task[A]</code></pre><p>
Now we will mechanically update the '<strong>lookupUser</strong>' function and any functions that call it to use the type alias:</p></div>

<div>
<pre><code>def inviteFriends(userID: UserID): Webapp[List[Send]] =
  for {
    user    &lt;- DB.lookupUser(userID)
    friends &lt;- Social.getFriends(user.facebookID)
    resp    &lt;- ZIO.foreach(friends) { friend =&gt;
                 Email.invite(user, friend.email)
               }
  } yield resp</code></pre>

<p>As an alternative to this technique, we could simply delete the return types entirely. However, itâ€™s a good practice to place return types on top-level function signatures, so developers without IDEs can easily determine the return type of functions.</p>

<p>After this step, we are ready to introduce a service for the database.</p>



<h3><strong>Introduce a Database Module</strong></h3>

<div>
<p>The database module will provide access to a database service.</p>

<p>As discussed in my post on&nbsp;<a href="http://degoes.net/articles/zio-environment">ZIO Environment</a>, the database module is an ordinary interface with a single field, which contains the database service.</p>

<p>We can define both the module and the service very simply:</p>

<pre><code>// The database module
trait Database {
  val database: Database.Service
}
object Database {
  // The database service
  trait Service {
    def lookupUser(uid: UserID): Task[UserProfile]
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>Notice how we have decided to place just one method inside the database service: the '<strong>lookupUser</strong>' method. Although there may be many database methods, we donâ€™t have time to make all of them testable, so we will focus on the one required by the '<strong>inviteFriends</strong>' method.</p>

<p>We are now ready to implement a production version of the service.</p>



<h3><strong>Implement Production Module</strong></h3>

<p>We will call the production database module '<strong>DatabaseLive</strong>'. To implement the module, we need only copy and paste the implementation of '<strong>Database.lookupUser</strong>' into our implementation of the service interface:</p>

<div>
<pre><code>trait DatabaseLive extends Database {
  val database = 
    new Database.Service {
      // Implementation copy/pasted from
      // DB.lookupUser:
      def lookupUser(userID: UserID) = 
        ...
    }
}
object DatabaseLive extends DatabaseLive</code></pre>

<p>For maximum flexibility and convenience, we have defined both a&nbsp;trait&nbsp;that implements the database module, which can be mixed into other traits, and an&nbsp;object&nbsp;that extends the trait, which can be used standalone.</p>



<h3><strong>Integrate Production Module</strong></h3>

<div>
<p>We now have all the pieces we need to replace the original '<strong>DB.lookupUser</strong>' method, whose actual implementation now resides inside our '<strong>DatabaseLive</strong>' module:</p>

<pre><code>object DB {
  ...
  def lookupUser(uid: UserID): ZIO[Database, Throwable, UserProfile] = 
    ZIO.accessM(_.database lookupUser uid)
  ...
}</code></pre>

<p>The '<strong>lookupUser</strong>' method merely delegates to the database module, by accessing the model through ZIO Environment ('<strong>ZIO.accessM</strong>').</p>

<p>Here we donâ€™t use the '<strong>Webapp</strong>' type alias, because the functions in '<strong>DB</strong>' will not necessarily have the same dependencies as our web application.</p>

<p>However, after enough refactoring, we might introduce a new type alias in the '<strong>DB</strong>' object: '<strong>type DB[A] = ZIO[Database, Throwable, A]</strong>'. Eventually, all methods in '<strong>DB</strong>' might return effects of this type.</p>

<p>At this point, our refactoring is nearly complete. But we have to take care of one last detail: we have to provide our database module to the production application.</p>

<p>There are two main ways to provide the database module to our application. If it is inconvenient to propagate the '<strong>Webapp</strong>' type signature to the top of our application, we can always supply the production module somewhere inside our application.</p>

<p>In the worst case, if we are pressed for time and need to ship code today, maybe we choose to provide the production database wherever we call '<strong>inviteFriends</strong>'.</p>

<pre><code>inviteFriends(userId).provide(DatabaseLive)</code></pre>

<p>If we have a bit more time, we can push the '<strong>Webapp</strong>' type synonym to the entry point of our purely functional application, which might be the main function, or it might be where our web framework calls into our code.</p>

<p>In this case, instead of using the '<strong>DefaultRuntime</strong>' that ships with ZIO, we can define our own '<strong>Runtime</strong>', which provides the production database module):</p>

<pre><code>val myRuntime = 
  Runtime(DatabaseLive, PlatformLive)</code></pre>

<p>The custom runtime can be used to run many different effects that all require the same environment, so we donâ€™t have to call '<strong>provide</strong>' on all of them before we run them.</p>

<p>Once we have this custom runtime, we can run our top-level effect, which will supply its required environment:</p>

<pre><code>myRuntime.unsafeRun(effect)</code></pre>

<p>At this point, we have not changed the behavior of our application at allâ€”it will work exactly as it did before. Weâ€™ve just moved the code around a bit, so we can access a tiny effect through ZIO environment.</p>

<p>Now itâ€™s time to build a database module specifically for testing.</p>



<p><strong>Implement Test Module</strong></p>

<p>We could implement the test database module using a mocking framework. However, to avoid all magic and use of reflection, in this post, we will build one from scratch.</p>

<p>For maximum flexibility, our test database module will track all calls to '<strong>lookupUser</strong>', and supply responses using a '<strong>Map</strong>', which can be dynamically changed by the test suite.</p>

<p>To support this stateful behavior, we will need a '<strong>Ref</strong>', which is a concurrent-safe ZIO data structure that models mutable references. We will also need a simple (immutable) data structure to hold the state of the test database module.</p>

<p>We define the following test data structure, which is capable of tracking a list of '<strong>UserID</strong>' values, and holding data that maps from '<strong>UserID</strong>' to '<strong>UserProfile</strong>'.</p>

<pre><code>final case class TestDatabaseState(
  lookups : List[UserID],
  data    : Map[UserID, UserProfile]
) {
  def addLookup(uid: UserID): TestDatabaseState = copy(lookups = uid :: lookups)
}</code></pre>

<p>Now we can define the service of our test database module. The service will require a '<strong>Ref[TestDatabaseState]</strong>', so it can not only use test data, but update the test state:</p>

<pre><code>final case class TestDatabaseService(ref: Ref[TestDatabaseState]) extends Database.Service {
  def lookupUser(uid: UserID): Task[UserProfile] = 
    for {
      _       &lt;- ref.update(_.addLookup uid)
      data    &lt;- ref.get.map(_.data)
      profile &lt;- Task.fromEither(data.get(uid)
                   .fold(Left(new DBErr))(
                     Right(_)))
    } yield profile
}</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the '<strong>lookupUser</strong>' function stores the '<strong>UserID</strong>' of every call in the '<strong>lookups</strong>' field of the '<strong>TestDatabaseState</strong>'. In addition, the function retrieves test responses from the map. If there is no response in the map, the function fails, presumably in the same way the production database would fail.</p>

<p>The test service must be placed in a module. In general, we should wait to create the module until the test suite, because then we will know the full set of dependencies for each test.</p>

<p>However, at this stage, the database service is the only dependency in our application, so we can make a helper function to create the test database module:</p>

<pre><code>object TestDatabase {
  def apply(ref: Ref[TestDatabaseState]): Database = 
    new Database {
      val database: Database.Service = 
        new TestDatabaseService(ref)
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>We now have all the pieces necessary to write a test of the '<strong>inviteFriends</strong>' function, which will use our test database module.</p>



<h3><strong>Write the Test</strong></h3>

<div>
<p>To more easily test the '<strong>lookupFriends</strong>' function, we will define a helper function. Given test data and input to the function, the helper will return the final test state and the output of the '<strong>lookupFriends</strong>' function:</p>

<pre><code>def runLookupFriends(data: Map[UserID, UserProfile], uid: UserID): Task[(TestDatabaseState, List[Send])] = 
  for {
    ref   &lt;- Ref.make(TestDatabaseState(Nil, data))
    resp  &lt;- lookupFriends(uid)
               .provide(TestDatabase(ref))
    state &lt;- ref.get 
  } yield (state, resp)</code></pre>

<p>The helper function creates a '<strong>Ref</strong>' with the initial test data, uses the '<strong>Ref</strong>' to create the '<strong>TestDatabase</strong>' module, and then supplies the database module to the effect returned by '<strong>lookupFriends</strong>'.</p>

<p>With this helper function, writing a test becomes quite simple:</p>

<pre><code>class TestSuite extends DefaultRuntime {
  def testLookupFriends = {
    val (state, resp) = 
      unsafeRun {
        runLookupFriends(
          Map(TestUserID -&gt; TestUserProfile),
          TestUserID
        )
      }
    
    (state.lookups must_=== List(TestUserID)) and
      (resp must_=== TestResponse)
}</code></pre>

<p>This test for '<strong>inviteFriends</strong>' is not perfect. It still interacts with a real Facebook API and a real email service. But compared to whatever tests already exist, at least this test does not interact with a real database.</p>

<p>Moreover, we were able to make this change in a&nbsp;minimally disruptive manner.</p>



<h3><strong>A Glimpse Beyond</strong></h3>

<div>
<p>After a little more refactoring, of course, we would succeed in making '<strong>inviteFriends</strong>' fully testable. Even after the full refactoring, the code for '<strong>lookupFriends</strong>' would not change.</p>

<p>Instead, our type alias for '<strong>Webapp</strong>' would expand to include new environmental effects:</p>

<pre><code>type WebappFX = 
  Database with Social with Email

type Webapp[A] = ZIO[WebappFX, Throwable, A]</code></pre>

<p>Now all the methods in the '<strong>DB</strong>', '<strong>Social</strong>', and '<strong>Email</strong>' objects would simply delegate to their respective modules using '<strong>ZIO.accessM</strong>'.</p>

<p>Running our application would now look a little different:</p>

<pre><code>val myRuntime = 
  Runtime(
    new  DatabaseLive 
    with SocialLive 
    with EmailLive, PlatformLive)
...
myRuntime.unsafeRun(effect)</code></pre>

<p>Finally, testing '<strong>lookupFriends</strong>' would be entirely fast, deterministic, and type-safe, without any dependencies on external systems, or use of any reflection.</p>



<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>

<div>
<p>Environmental effects make it easy to test purely functional applicationsâ€”significantly easier and with less ceremony than tagless-final, with full type inference, and without false promises.</p>

<p>Morever, with environmental effects, we can make even just a&nbsp;single function testable, by pushing that function into an environmental effect. This requires just a few small changes that can be done incrementally without major disruption to the application.</p>

<p>This ability lets us make incremental progress towards better application architecture. We donâ€™t have to solve all the problems in our code base at once. We can focus on making our application a little better each day.</p>

<p>While this post focused on ZIO Environment, if youâ€™re using '<strong>Future</strong>', Monix, or Cats IO, you can still use this approach with a '<strong>ReaderT</strong>' monad transformer. With a monad transformer, you will lose type inference and some performance, but you will gain the other benefits in a more familiar package.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to give ZIO Environment a try, hop over to the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-zio">Github project page</a>, and be sure to stop by the&nbsp;<a href="https://gitter.im/scalaz/scalaz-zio">Gitter channel</a>&nbsp;and say hello.</p>

<p>In future posts, I will cover how to provide partial dependencies, how to model services that require other services (the&nbsp;graph problem), how to hide implementation details, and how this approach differs from the classic cake pattern. Stay tuned for more!'</p>
