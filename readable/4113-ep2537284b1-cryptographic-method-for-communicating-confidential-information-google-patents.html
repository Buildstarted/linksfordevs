In particular, in the RSA algorithm, it is necessary to carry out calculations on public keys of large sizes, and in particular calculations of discrete exponentials. Such calculations can be slow, especially when implemented on low cost cryptographic devices with limited computing capabilities, such as on chip cards or radio frequency tags.</p></li><li><para-num num="[0008]"></para-num><p id="p0008" num="0008" class="description-line">Among the alternatives to cryptographic authentication methods based on the RSA algorithm, authentication cryptographic methods are known that use an error correction code decoding from a public matrix.

Similarly, the publication "Improved Identification Schemes based on error-correcting codes", Veron, Applicable Alegbra in Engineering, Communication and Computing, 1997, describes a variant of the protocol by syndrome, still in the context of a cryptographic procedure of authentication using error correction code decoding from a public matrix.</p></div></li><li><para-num num="[0010]"></para-num><p id="p0010" num="0010" class="description-line">However, the storage constraints of low-cost cryptographic devices do not make it possible to implement such a protocol.</p></li><li><para-num num="[0011]"></para-num><p id="p0011" num="0011" class="description-line">Other cryptographic methods known to those skilled in the art are based on the Diffie-Hellman protocol that has been the foundation for the development of many developments concerning modern cryptography.</p></li><li><para-num num="[0012]"></para-num><p id="p0012" num="0012" class="description-line">This protocol was described for the first time in the publication " <span class="inline-nplcit" id="ncit0002-EN" npl-type="s"> New Directions in Cryptography, W. Diffie and ME Hellman, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol.

The security of this protocol stems from the difficulty of reversing the exponential function efficiently and more particularly from the difficulty of solving the problem exp (ab) from exp ( a) and exp (b).</p></li><li><para-num num="[0013]"></para-num><p id="p0013" num="0013" class="description-line">The Diffie-hellman protocol is used in many applications but has a significant cost since the resolution of exponential problems is, from an algorithmic point of view, one of the most complex arithmetic functions. Those who tried to limit this cost by replacing the exponential function with other functions encountered many difficulties and have never been able to identify a solution that is both inexpensive in calculations and sufficiently secure.</p></li><li><para-num num="[0014]"></para-num><p id="p0014" num="0014" class="description-line">It is also known from a different technical field of quantum cryptography solutions to solve problems of confidential key exchange. The quantum communication protocol allows Alice to be in possession of a random variable X and Bob to be in possession of a noisy version Y of the random variable X. </p></li><li><para-num num="[0015]"></para-num><p id="p0015" num="0015" class="description-line">Thus, through the use of conventional communication protocols Bob can, during a reconciliation phase, remove the noise of the noisy version Y of the random variable X and deduce confidential information. Confidential information is shared by Alice and Bob unconditionally. This quantum communication protocol is therefore advantageous since it makes it possible to exchange confidential information with the certainty that it will not be intercepted. But it has the major disadvantage of requiring the use of a quantum tunnel between Alice and Bob, which is extremely restrictive from a practical point of view. <br>The article "On Lattices, Learning with Errors, Random Linear Codes, and Cryptography" by O. Regev, XP-002497024, describes in section 4 a public key cryptography method. <br>There is therefore an unmet need in the field of cryptography for the realization of a communication protocol that allows the exchange of confidential information without being too expensive both in terms of resources and execution, in order to be able to integrated on low-cost cryptographic devices such as smart cards or radio frequency identification chips (RFID) but which nevertheless provides a degree of security that is sufficiently reliable and a sufficiently short response time.</p></li><heading
