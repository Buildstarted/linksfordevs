Well – it’s a slightly complicated story.</p><p>Since the IdentityServer Nuget packages are referenced in some of the ASP.NET Core 3 templates, we had a bit of a chicken/egg situation, and we worked closely with the ASP.NET Team (thanks Javier!) to make sure we are doing this right.</p><p><strong>Our</strong> 3.0 version is referencing ASP.NET Core 3 Preview9 which is fully supported for production and we were promised that there won’t be any changes that affect us between now and <strong>their</strong> RTM. IOW – ASP.NET Core 3 will ship with a reference to <strong>our</strong> 3.0 – and on the 23rd September, we will release a 3.0.1 which then will in turn reference <strong>their</strong> 3.0…and hopefully all the stars align ;)</p><p><em>(For those who know – this concludes a long – and sometimes painful – journey, that started back in 2012)</em></p><p>Long story short – our version of IdentityServer4 targeting ASP.NET Core 3 is now on Nuget, and you can give it a try. Next step for us is updating all our docs, samples and workshop materials, which should be done by the 23rd September.</p><p><strong>What’s new?</strong><br>Well not a lot really. Our main focus was to ensure compatibility with ASP.NET Core 3, but since we had the opportunity to do a bit of a re-org, we added the last missing pieces that were required for our <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI</a> compliance. Namely support for the <em>PS*</em> family of signing algorithms (along with support for elliptic curves as well) and <em>s_hash</em> support. More details in upcoming blog posts.</p><p>As always – feedback is appreciated.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4">repo</a> / <a href="https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4/pull/3609">commits</a> / <a href="https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4/releases/tag/3.0.0">release notes</a></p><div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled"><h3 class="jp-relatedposts-headline"><em>Related</em></h3></div></div></div></div></div>
