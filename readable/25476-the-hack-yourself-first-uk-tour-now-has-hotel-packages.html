This is a 2-day, hands-on workshop designed to teach developers and technology professionals about offensive security. Here are the dates and locations for the tour:</p><br><h5 id="manchester-27th-and-28th-june">Manchester - 27th and 28th June</h5><h5 id="london-4th-and-5th-july">London - 4th and 5th July</h5><h5 id="glasgow-18th-and-19th-july">Glasgow - 18th and 19th July</h5><p>You can find details about the exact location, prices and everything else in that original <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/hack-yourself-first-uk-tour/">announcement</a>, but this blog post is about our new hotel packages!</p><p><strong>Update:</strong><a href="https://files.troyhunt.com/HYF%20UK%20Tour%20Brochure.pdf">Download our new PDF brochure here!</a></p><br><h4 id="hotel-packages">Hotel Packages</h4><p>To make attending a workshop even easier we're offering hotel packages so those who want or need them can book and only need to add travel and expenses to the total. At all locations the hotel in the package is the same hotel I'm staying at and the rate will include B&amp;B + WiFi. </p><p>Of course, each workshop comes with food and refreshments on the day so the only additions would be travel and evening meals. The 2 night package is for the Wednesday night before the training and the Thursday night in the middle, meaning you check out on the Friday morning. The ticket + hotel packages for each location are as follows and prices are +VAT. </p><br><h5 id="manchester">Manchester</h5><p><br>2 Nights <strong>£1,550</strong></p><br><h5 id="london">London</h5><p><br>2 Nights <strong>£1,650</strong></p><br><h5 id="glasgow">Glasgow</h5><p><br>2 Nights <strong>£1,550</strong></p><p>If you do need more customised arrangements then please get in touch and I'm sure we can create a package that suits your needs! For now though, if you'd like to book a ticket with or without the hotel package then please get in touch: training@scotthelme.co.uk</p><p>We also have our <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n202tyefw1ua5i1/HYF%20UK%20Tour%20Brochure.pdf?dl=0">HYF UK Tour Brochure</a> that you can download and it contains all of the information you need!</p></div></div></div></div>
