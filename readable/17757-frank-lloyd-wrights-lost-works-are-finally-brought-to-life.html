Thanks to a labor-intensive project undertaken by Spanish architect <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/one-architect-revolutionizing-how-we-preserve-iconic-architecture">David Romero</a>, fans of the prolific architect can now see what Wright’s unbuilt or demolished projects look like in 3-D renderings, as if they had been built or rebuilt. Romero partnered with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation to use Wright’s sketches and site plans to create the new models, which offer a glimpse into a world of architecture never materialized or were destroyed. “While we will never know the true experience of visiting an unbuilt Wright design, these renderings can convey a bit more sense of space and light than the drawings alone,” explains Stuart Graff, president and CEO of the foundation. Here, <em>AD</em> looks at six structures designed by the genius architect, yet never materialized or were lost to time.</p></div></div></div></div>
