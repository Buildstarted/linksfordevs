                                                <section>                 	<p data-words="40">San Francisco‚Äôs car ban on Market Street ‚Äî introduced a month ago after 10 years of handwringing ‚Äî has barely affected motorists, with almost no spillover traffic on side streets. But it‚Äôs a huge improvement for buses, streetcars and bicycles.</p>


                                                                	
                                                                	<p data-words="63">Congestion increased only marginally on nearby roads, according to new data <a href="https://inrix.com/blog/2020/02/full-car-ban-on-market-street-little-impact-on-surrounding-roads/">from the traffic analytics firm Inrix</a>. It shows that the biggest slowdown occurred on Mission Street, where southbound vehicle speeds decreased by 4% ‚Äî from 10.3 miles per hour to 9.9 miles per hour ‚Äî during the 8 a.m. commute. On other adjacent streets, car speeds declined by an average of 1%.</p>


                                                                	<p data-words="44">On the flip side, transit riders on Market Street benefited significantly from the removal of cars. Muni lines are running 6% faster on average, said Erica Kato, an agency spokeswoman. Some bus lines shaved 12% travel time, which means rides are two minutes shorter.</p>


                                                                	<p data-words="23">Cyclists are thriving. Since <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Car-free-Market-What-happens-to-the-side-14999923.php">the city banished private automobiles from its main spine on Jan. 29</a>, the number of bicycles increased by 25%.</p>


                                                                	<p data-words="44">These outcomes mirror those of the 14th Street busway in New York, a major east-west Manhattan thoroughfare that officials closed to private automobiles in October. It‚Äôs had ‚Äúvery little negative impact‚Äù to drivers on surrounding roadways, said Trevor Reed, a transportation analyst at Inrix.</p>


                                                                	<!-- ferd/hearst/templates/premium/article/content/related-links.tpl -->

Every weekday the buses on Third move 52,000 people ‚Äî ‚Äúas many people as all the other avenues combined,‚Äù Reed said.</p>


                                                                	<p data-words="22">His conclusion: When cities shut streets off to cars, people drive less. The myth of a ‚Äúcarmageddon‚Äù-style traffic jam is apparently overblown.</p>


                                                                	
                                                                	<p data-words="27">‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs choice to drive is a lot more flexible than we typically think,‚Äù Reed said, noting that motorists adapt by not using their cars for shorter trips.</p>


                                                                	<p data-words="12">Some may even switch to buses, now that Muni is moving faster.</p>


                                                                	<em><p>Rachel Swan is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: <a href="mailto:rswan@sfchronicle.com">rswan@sfchronicle.com</a> Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelswan">@rachelswan</a></p></em>
