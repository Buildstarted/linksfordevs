<p>A full-featured Linux desktop app has been our most requested feature by far and responsible for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/2846/new-product-request-1password-for-linux">longest forum post</a> in our history. Today we’re thrilled to announce that 1Password is coming to Linux! 🎉</p>
<p><img src="https://com-agilebits-users.s3.amazonaws.com/dave/1password-linux-hero-nonscaled-web-iNFpMV172f7S.png" alt="1Password for Linux running on Ubuntu"></p>
<p>Planned for official release later this year, we couldn’t wait to share the news with you so today we’re unveiling <span>an alpha</span> a development preview so you can join in on the fun.</p>
<h2 data-id="not-exactly-an-lts-release">Not exactly an LTS release</h2>
<p>This isn’t a long-term support release! You can expect many updates and changes over the next few months as many features are not complete yet. For example, the app is currently read only: there is no item editing, creation of vaults, or item organization.</p>
<p>As such this initial release should be used <strong>for testing and validation purposes only and is not suitable for business critical environments</strong>. For a stable experience on Linux you’ll want to use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://support.1password.com/explore/whats-new-1password-x/">1Password X</a> in your browser.</p>
<h2 data-id="a-true-linux-app">A true Linux app</h2>
<p>Our new app is built to meet the security and performance expectations of Linux users. Its backend is written completely in Rust, a secure systems programming language that has made a lot of waves in the Linux community. We’re especially proud to be using the incredible <a rel="nofollow" href="https://discussions.agilebits.com/home/leaving?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbriansmith%2Fring">ring crypto library</a> to power the end-to-end encryption that keeps your data safe.</p>
<p>In addition to a secure foundation we’ve tailored the app to integrate with Desktop Linux with features like:</p>
<ul><li>Simple and secure installs using apt and dnf packager managers 📦</li>
<li>Automatic Dark Mode selection based on your GTK theme 🌓</li>
<li>Open network locations (FTP, SSH, SMB) 🌍</li>
<li>Tiling window manager support and descriptive window titles 🏠</li>
<li>Unlock with your Linux user account, including biometrics ☝️</li>
<li>System tray icon for staying unlocked while closed 📌</li>
<li>X11 clipboard integration and clearing ✂️</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts ⌨️</li>
<li>Data export ✈️</li>
<li>Unlock multiple accounts with different passwords 🔐</li>
<li>Create collections to organize data across accounts and vaults 🎯</li>
</ul><p>And this is just what’s available in the preview. There will be many more exciting features that will take advantage of the power of Linux as we get closer to release.</p>
<h2 data-id="free-accounts-for-open-source-teams">Free accounts for open source teams</h2>
<p>Our new app is built on great open source projects like the Rust programming language for the underlying logic, and React for a responsive component-based UI.</p>
<p>Building an app for Linux wouldn’t have been possible without these giant shoulders to stand upon so we want to give back to the free software community. If you work on an open source team that needs a password manager, open a PR against our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://discussions.agilebits.com/home/leaving?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2F1Password%2F1password-teams-open-source">1Password for Open Source Projects</a> repo and we’ll give you and everybody on your team a free account. You and your team will be able to continue using this account even when the development preview ends.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your contributions and making the world a better place. 🤗❤️</p>
<h2 data-id="apt-get-install-1password">apt-get install 1password</h2>
<p>If you’re excited to report issues, work with us to resolve them, and update to verify fixes, then you’re welcome to join us on this journey. To get started read the guide <a rel="nofollow" href="https://support.1password.com/cs/getting-started-linux/">Get to know 1Password for Linux</a> to find installation and troubleshooting instructions.</p>
<p>We maintain signed apt and rpm package repositories for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. We also have an AppImage for as-of-yet unsupported distributions. Let us know what distribution you use and how well 1Password works there.</p>
<p>We hope you are as excited about a 1Password Linux app as we are. Our development team will be active in this forum so when you find issues please report them here.</p>
