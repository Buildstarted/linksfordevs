<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-test-id="comment"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>Yeah it‚Äôs back down to the original Avengers plus Rocket, Captain Marvel, War Machine, Ant Man, and Nebula. It‚Äôs crazy how many people died but because the MCU has gotten so big it‚Äôs still the original team (and all their power ups) PLUS those people. In terms of ‚ÄúAvengers‚Äù power, they didn‚Äôt really lose much. Scarlett Witch was finally shown at full power in IW but before that didn‚Äôt do much, Black Panther is fun but firmly in the mid tier in terms of fighting power, the Guardians are strong in their own self-contained movies and IW tried to show them holding their own against Iron and Spider-Man and Doctor Strange but realistically given how well Stark and Strange did 1 v 1 against Thanos I think they‚Äôd both wreck the guardians single-handedly, Spider-Man too probably.</p><p>The Avengers still have Iron Man and Thor who have both just gotten insane power boosts (Thor solo‚Äôd a fully-powered Thanos and basically killed him in one shot, Iron Man‚Äôs nanotechnology is magic and withstood the full force of the Power Stone, then he got Thanos to bleed which no one else had) Captain Marvel whose super saiyan form looks as strong as Thor, and probably the Hulk still. That‚Äôs without going into whatever quantum tomfoolery they‚Äôre exposed to with Ant Man. In terms of fighting strength Groot was the only real loss from the snap, Star Lord is basically Falcon and Rocket is basically Bucky. Drax is like, Black Widow level and while Mantis is useful she‚Äôs not exactly ‚Äústrong.‚Äù Gamora is fine but still at BEST in the Cap/BP/Vision? (AOU Vision was a hard hitter, IW Vision was a weenie so idk how to gauge him) tier.</p><p>Edit: and maybe Wong too? Idk I can‚Äôt see him being a big part of Endgame even if he didn‚Äôt get dusted</p></div></div></div></div>
