            From early on in math class, youâ€™re taught that you cannot divide a number by zero. On paper, it doesnâ€™t work out. Do it electronically, and youâ€™ll get an error message. http://goo.gl/K1HGYC

Try do divide by zero with a mechanical calculator and, well, thatâ€™s where things get interesting.

YouTuber MultiGlizda recorded the chaos that happens within a Facit ESA-01 mechanical calculator when itâ€™s asked to divide a number by zero. With the case off, viewers are able to see the fascinating inner workings of these old machines in operation, and also demonstrate the dicey nature of the number zero and its division.

YouTube channel numberphile explains that division is based on subtraction; that is, if you want to divide a number by a second number, you just subtract second number from the first number over and over again. So, 20 divided by 5 would be 20 minus 5, which equals 15, minus 5 which equals 10, minus 5 which equals 5, minus 5 which equals 0. Since it took four subtractions to get to zero, the answer is 4. 

Itâ€™s a bit of a convoluted way of explaining division, but it helps us understand the video below. You see, when you divide 20 by 0, youâ€™ll end up subtracting 0 from 20 an infinite amount of times. And in the case of the Facit ESA-01 mechanical calculator, what winds up happening is the machine attempts to complete the infinite number of operations it believes is necessary to complete the division.
