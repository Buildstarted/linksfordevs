If you try to migrate the UI portion, you are on a road of pain and madness and the end result will be something that Microsoft stops supporting in a few years' time anyway. <strong>If your business isn't willing to give you time to do this, don't bother migrating to Core.</strong></p><p>Personally, I wouldn't recommend migrating anything. Start new projects in Core and upgrade as new versions come along, accept that current Framework projects are legacy and make plans to sunset them, and you will be much happier.</p><blockquote><p>We are (were) faced with having to migrate BACK to EF which although the older library, has better forward support than EF Core at the time of writing.</p></blockquote><p>... what?</p><p>You do realise there's versions of EF Core prior to 3.0, right?</p><p>You do realise that .NET Core 3.0 supports .NET Standard 2.1, and therefore there's no good reason for anything that's targeted at Core 3.0 (like, say, EF Core <strong>3.0</strong>) to support any earlier version of Standard, right?</p><p>I'm sure the EF Core team is going to claim that EF versions are not tied to Core versions but let's be honest - there's a very particular reason they branded this release 3.0.0 and not 2.3.0. The messaging from Microsoft here is clear as day: if you want the latest versions of components that depend on Core, you have to be on the latest version of Core. Simple and unambiguous, yet why do so many people not get it?</p><p>And why has the EF Core team now decided to create a scenario where EF Core 3.0.0 requires .NET Standard 2.1, but 3.1.0 will only require Standard 2.0, and then 3.2.0 and onward will require Standard 2.1 again? It's bloody bonkers, and it certainly won't stop people crying about not being able to upgrade because the third-party frameworks they use haven't yet put in the effort to support Core 3.0, despite it being in preview for an entire year.</p><p>So... yeah. I appreciate this is a relatively small change, and it makes people who are behind the curve feel warm and fuzzy inside, but I honestly don't see the point.</p></div></div></div></div>
