<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Two employee activists at Google say they have been retaliated against for helping to organize a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-walkout-just-latest-sign-tech-worker-unrest/">walkout</a> among thousands of Google workers in November, and are planning a ‚Äútown hall‚Äù meeting on Friday for others to discuss alleged instances of retaliation.</p><p>In a message posted to many internal Google mailing lists Monday, Meredith Whittaker, who leads Google‚Äôs Open Research, said that after the company <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-needs-grow-cloud-business-carefully/">disbanded its external AI ethics council</a> on April 4, she was told that her role would be ‚Äúchanged dramatically.‚Äù Whittaker said she was told that, in order to stay at the company, she would have to ‚Äúabandon‚Äù her work on AI ethics and her role at AI Now Institute, a research center she cofounded at New York University.</p><p>Claire Stapleton, another walkout organizer and a 12-year veteran of the company, said in the email that two months after the protest she was told she would be demoted from her role as marketing manager at YouTube and lose half her reports. After escalating the issue to human resources, she said she faced further retaliation. ‚ÄúMy manager started ignoring me, my work was given to other people, and I was told to go on medical leave, even though I‚Äôm not sick,‚Äù Stapleton wrote. After she hired a lawyer, the company conducted an investigation and seemed to reverse her demotion. ‚ÄúWhile my work has been restored, the environment remains hostile and I consider quitting nearly every day,‚Äù she wrote.</p><p>Whittaker and Stapleton are two of the seven employees who helped organize the mass demonstration in November, during which <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-walkout-just-latest-sign-tech-worker-unrest/">20,000 Google workers</a> briefly walked out of their office to protest the company‚Äôs mishandling of sexual harassment claims.</p><p>In a statement, a Google spokesperson said: "We prohibit retaliation in the workplace and investigate all allegations. Employees and teams are regularly and commonly given new assignments, or reorganized, to keep pace with evolving business needs. There has been no retaliation here.‚Äù Whittaker and Stapleton did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p><strong>Here is the full text of their letter:</strong></p><p><em>Hi all,</em><em>This was a hard email to write.</em></p><p><em>Google is retaliating against several organizers.</em></p><p><em>We are among them and here is what‚Äôs happening to us:</em></p><p><strong>Meredith</strong></p><p><em>Just after Google announced that it would disband its AI ethics council, I was informed my role would be changed dramatically. I‚Äôm told that to remain at the company I will have to abandon my work on AI ethics and the AI Now Institute, which I cofounded, and which has been doing rigorous and recognized work on these topics. I have worked on issues of AI ethics and bias for years, and am one of the people who helped shape the field looking at these problems. I have also taken risks to push for a more ethical Google, even when this is less profitable or convenient.</em></p><p><strong>Claire</strong></p><p><em>After five years as a high performer in YouTube Marketing (and almost twelve at Google), two months after the Walkout, I was told that I would be demoted, that I‚Äôd lose half my reports, and that a project that was approved was no longer on the table. I escalated to HR and to my VP, which made things significantly worse. My manager started ignoring me, my work was given to other people, and I was told to go on medical leave, even though I‚Äôm not sick. Only after I hired a lawyer and had her contact Google did management conduct an investigation and walked back my demotion, at least on paper. While my work has been restored, the environment remains hostile and I consider quitting nearly every day.</em></p></div></div><div><div><p><em>Our stories aren‚Äôt the only ones. Google has a culture of retaliation, which too often works to silence women, people of color, and gender minorities. Retaliation isn‚Äôt always obvious. It‚Äôs often confusing and drawn out, consisting of icy conversations, gaslighting, project cancellations, transition rejections, or demotions. Behavior that tells someone the problem isn‚Äôt that they stood up to the company, it‚Äôs that they‚Äôre not good enough and don‚Äôt belong.</em></p><p><em>During the Walkout, we collected 350 stories. Reading them, a sad pattern emerges: People who stand up and report discrimination, abuse, and unethical conduct are punished, sidelined, and pushed out. Perpetrators often go unimpeded, or are even rewarded (Andy, Amit, ‚ÄúI reported, he got promoted‚Äù).</em></p><p><em>By punishing those who resist discrimination, harassment, and unethical decision making. Google permits these behaviors. This harms people inside the company, and communities outside who bear the brunt of Google‚Äôs bad choices. If we want to stop discrimination, harassment, and unethical decisionmaking, we need to end retaliation against the people who speak honestly about these problems.</em></p><p><em>We need to push back. Here are some next steps:</em></p><p><em>1. We will be hosting a Retaliation Town Hall to share our stories and strategize.
When: Friday, April 26, 11am PT/2pm ET. Add the event to your calendar here. [The message included an internal link to a livestream of the meeting.]</em></p><p><em>2. If you‚Äôve been retaliated against, please share your story. (If you shared your story with the Walkout form, feel free to reshare and help keep everything in one place.) The more we share with each other, the easier it will be to push back. Add yours.</em></p><p><em>Sincerely,</em></p><p><em>Meredith, Claire</em></p><p><em>Updated 4-22-19, 3:15 pm: This article has been updated to include a statement from a Google spokesperson.</em></p><hr><p>More Great WIRED Stories</p><ul><li>In the 2020 race, what's <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/2020-race-democrats-social-media-stardom/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_4">social media stardom</a> worth?</li><li><em>Apex Legends</em> succeeds by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apex-legends-success/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_4">keeping it simple</a></li><li>The Julian Assange I met in 2010 <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-julian-assange-i-met-in-2010-doesnt-exist-anymore/?BottomRelatedStories_Sections_4">doesn't exist anymore</a></li><li>Dr. Elon &amp; Mr. Musk: Life inside Tesla's <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-tesla-life-inside-gigafactory/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_4">production hell</a></li><li>It started as an online prank. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/swatting-deadly-online-gaming-prank/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_4">Then it turned deadly</a></li><li>üì±Torn between the latest phones?
