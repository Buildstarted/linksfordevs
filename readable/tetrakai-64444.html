                <p>Let‚Äôs talk tax! Taxes aren‚Äôt the most interesting of topics, but as a mass
exodus from San Francisco begins in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are
a whole bunch of people working at Silicon Valley tech companies who are going
to have to start dealing with them in much more depth.</p>

<p>In general, people expect that taxes will be complicated in the year that they
move. However, if you‚Äôre being granted equity, as most Silicon Valley employees
are, you might be surprised to discover that they will be complicated for much
longer.</p>

<p>If you choose to move internationally, rather than just interstate, this counts
for double. My partner and I ‚Äî neither of us US citizens ‚Äî moved from San
Francisco to Sydney three years ago, and have spent the last few years figuring
out our tax situation. We struggled a lot to find good guidance on any of this
online, so I‚Äôm going to take the time to document what we learned in a few
posts, so that I can make the path more well-trodden for the next person.</p>

<p>Although I‚Äôve spent a lot of time learning about this, I‚Äôm not a tax
professional. If any of it sounds wrong to you, or if you have your own story to
share, please <a href="mailto:hello@karla.io">reach out</a>!</p>

<h3 id="trailing-tax-liabilities">üìÜTrailing tax liabilities</h3>
<p>Income taxes sound like they should be simple: at the end of a tax year, you pay
a percentage of the amount that you earned that year to the relevant tax agency.
In some countries, your employer collects these taxes as you earn them
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-as-you-earn_tax">PAYE/PAYG</a>), and you need
to think about them even less.</p>

<p>Equity complicates this situation. When you‚Äôre granted equity, you‚Äôre being
promised something of value. There‚Äôs a problem though: that equity might not yet
be liquid ‚Äî it could have a vesting schedule, you might not have exercised it,
it could be in a private company‚Ä¶ and if it‚Äôs not liquid, you probably
shouldn‚Äôt have to pay anything when it‚Äôs given to you. Many tax jurisdictions
handle this by choosing to tax you at a later point: rather than when the equity
is granted, instead taxing you when it vests, is exercised (in the case of
options), or is sold.</p>

<p>However, imagine you move tax jurisdictions between the date where you‚Äôre given
the equity, and the date on which you actually pay tax. The first jurisdiction
now has a problem: in their eyes, you earned that equity while you lived there,
and they only gave you a free pass on immediately paying tax on it through the
goodness of their hearts. When you eventually pay tax in the second tax
jurisdiction, they want a piece of that too.</p>

<p>This is a trailing tax liability.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, any time that you‚Äôre granted equity in one jurisdiction, but
only trigger a taxation event on it in another, the first jurisdiction is likely
to say that they also have taxation rights.</p>

<p>That first jurisdiction is said to have ‚Äúsource‚Äù taxation rights, because that‚Äôs
where the asset was sourced, while the second is said to have ‚Äúresidency‚Äù
taxation rights, i.e. the right to tax you because you are presently a resident.</p>

<h3 id="apportioning-income">üí∞Apportioning income</h3>
<p>Now presumably, if you worked in both jurisdictions between the point where you
were given the equity, and the point at which you pay tax, there‚Äôs some
percentage that each should be considered the source of.</p>

<p>Internationally, this apportionment is governed by pairwise tax treaties between
countries. These are typically based on the
<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page28">OECD model tax convention</a>,
which helpfully has an in-depth commentary on this exact point
(<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page329">Commentary on Article 15, 12.14</a>).
In short, unless otherwise agreed between two countries, income is allocated
based on the percentage of <em>workdays</em> spent in each jurisdiction, from the day
the equity was granted, to the day that it vested. Note that this percentage
will differ for each tranche, or part of a grant, that vests on a different day.</p>

<p>However, those treaties only apply at the country to country level, i.e. for
taxes levied federally. In addition to imposing federal taxes, the US also has
state taxes, and these are not governed by international tax treaties.</p>

<p>That allows states to take a different view of how to decide whether income
belongs to them, and in fact, they do. For restricted stock, California takes
the same view as the tax treaty, and considers the period from grant to
vest. However, for someone granted options in California, who is a non-resident
when they exercise those options, the source is calculated by the percentage of
workdays spent in California from grant to <em>exercise</em>, rather than to vest (per
the <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/misc/1004.html">Equity-Based Compensation Guidelines</a>).</p>

<h3 id="residency-taxation">üè†Residency taxation</h3>
<p>But the tax doesn‚Äôt stop there! In addition to the source jurisdiction taxing
you for the percentage they believe is theirs, the jurisdiction in which you are
currently a resident will also want to tax you, typically on 100% of the
income you earn from an asset. This can lead to double taxation: residency
taxation means you need to pay tax on 100% of the income to your current tax
jurisdiction, but you also need to pay tax on some percentage of the income
(potentially up to 100% again) to the source jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Many tax agencies provide relief against this situation, in the form of tax
credits: if you‚Äôve already had to pay tax in one location for the same event,
they won‚Äôt charge you again.</p>

<h3 id="worked-example">üìîWorked example</h3>
<p>That‚Äôs a lot to take in, so let‚Äôs work through an example:</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs assume you were granted 1,000 non-qualified stock options (NSOs) with a
strike price of $1.00, on 2018-07-01, while a tax resident of California.
The options vest once a year for the next four years, in four equal tranches of
250.</p>

<p>(If you‚Äôre not familiar with options, an NSO gives you the right to purchase a
given company‚Äôs stock at a given price, regardless of its current market value.
In this case, the option would be valuable if the company‚Äôs stock price rose
above $1.00, because you could exercise your right to pay the company $1.00 for
a share, and then immediately sell that share at its market value, taking the
difference as a profit, and consequently, as income.)</p>

<p>About a year and a half later, on 2020-03-01, you move from California to
Melbourne, Australia. We can figure out the source of each of those tranches
like so:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tranche</th>
      <th>Relevant work period</th>
      <th>Total workdays</th>
      <th>US workdays</th>
      <th>AU workdays</th>

    <tr>

    <tr>

      <td>417</td>

      <td>243</td>
      <td>42%</td>
      <td>58%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Internationally, these percentages apply regardless of when you choose to
exercise those options, provided you do so after the date you move to Australia.
However, those options are also subject to taxation within California, and as
we‚Äôve mentioned, the tax agency there believes in a different source percentage
scheme.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say that you don‚Äôt touch that equity until three years after your move,
on 2023-03-01, when you choose to exercise it all.</p>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If we assume that once exercised, but not prior, your options become liquid
shares, you‚Äôll be taxed by each of the US federally, California, and Australia
on the day you exercise. Taking just the 2020-07-01 tranche into consideration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you‚Äôll be taxed on 83% of the income in the US,</li>
  <li>you‚Äôll be taxed on 36% of the income in California, and</li>
  <li>you‚Äôll be taxed on 100% of the income in Australia, which has residency
 taxation rights. However, you‚Äôll be able to get tax credits for tax paid
 in the US federally on the 83% of the income considered to be foreign-sourced.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that despite having lived outside of the US and California for 3
years on the date of exercise, you‚Äôll still need to declare US and Californian
income, and pay tax in those jurisdictions. If you‚Äôd moved interstate within the
US, you‚Äôd still be filing federal returns regardless, but you‚Äôd also be required
to file a Californian return that year.</p>

<h3 id="gotchas">üîéGotchas</h3>
<p>Note that there‚Äôs a big gotcha in the worked example above: you only got to
claim tax credits in Australia for the 83% income that the US taxed federally,
but not for the 36% that California taxed.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs because, as previously mentioned, the tax treaties only operate between
pairs of countries, not between one country and a state in the other. This
means it‚Äôs quite possible that you won‚Äôt be able to get tax credits for taxes
paid to a state of another country, and will end up double taxed on part of your
income.</p>

<p>For the worked example, Australia specifically
<a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/pdf/pbr/it2507.pdf">does consider Californian taxes to be a part of the US income tax system</a>,
so you would in actuality be allowed to claim credits for taxes paid there,
though the same isn‚Äôt true in all other countries.</p>

<h3 id="investments">üìàInvestments</h3>
<p>You might wonder what happens when you eventually sell the shares you get as
a result of exercising ‚Äì will those also be subject to US or Californian
taxes? While I don‚Äôt have personal experience with this situation, the OECD
tax treaty commentary clarifies this point in
(<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page326">Article 15, 12.2</a>):
only the income effectively connected to your employment is taxable in the
source jurisdiction. Since exercising is considered to be an investment
decision, any increase in value of the share resulting from the exercise of an
option is considered to be a capital gain, and is therefore <em>not</em> taxable by the
source jurisdiction. Helpfully, this is also California‚Äôs interpretation, giving
us some much-needed consistency between what happens internationally and within
California.</p>

<p>If instead you had chosen to exercise prior to moving, the OECD commentary
states that when you moved the asset would be treated as being capital in
nature, and so would only be taxable in your jurisdiction of residence at sale.
However, several countries, including the US and Australia, impose capital gains
taxes on citizens and permanent residents who move their residency to be in
another country.</p>

<h3 id="Ô∏è-different-taxing-points">‚û°Ô∏è Different taxing points</h3>
<p>Although it might seem complex, in our example above, it was fairly simple to
reason about how tax credits would be applied, because the taxation events
occurred at the same time in each of the different jurisdictions. However, this
is far from a guarantee ‚Äî different tax agencies can have different views
of the point at which taxation should occur.</p>

<p>This complicates the discussion, because we end up needing to have three
different views of the world: what happened according to each of the source
jurisdiction, the residency jurisdiction, and the tax treaty.</p>

<p>These can get out of sync with one another! In order to understand how that
happens, and talk about how to reconcile the inconsistencies, we‚Äôll need a
better understanding of how equity is taxed domestically in each jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In the next post, I‚Äôll start with a deep dive into US equity taxation, then
move onto Australian equity taxation (less broadly relevant, but we need a
second country and it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm most familiar with), then we‚Äôll put what
we‚Äôve learned back together to see how many edge cases we can find.</p>
