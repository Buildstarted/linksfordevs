    <h1>Stay in-the-know: Introducing the Performance Matters newsletter</h1>
    <article class="post single"> <p id="single-post"> <section class="post-content single-post-content"> <article> <p>As you&#x2019;re juggling deployments, writing code, and attending meetings there&#x2019;s not a great deal of time left for staying up to date with the latest trends in tech.</p> <p>The culture around performance is getting stronger &#x2014; performance is absolutely a feature, yet the pressure is on to deliver more without sacrificing quality. The good news is that there are companies who have achieved their performance goals &#x2014; and more. There&#x2019;s a lot to learn from juggernauts like <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog">Netflix</a>, but also the lesser-known performance pioneers breaking the boundaries of what we thought possible.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re launching <a href="https://performancematters.dev/">Performance Matters</a> - a weekly email curation of software performance news and inspiration delivered to you, the tech leader, every week.</p> <p>Here are a few reasons why you should subscribe.</p> <p>We&#x2019;ve noticed an uptick in software professionals talking about software quality and performance. As an industry, we&#x2019;re starting to ask how we can measure software quality and what that might look like in a high-performing team. With Performance Matters, we want to add fuel to that conversation.</p> <p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Dear Twitterererers,</p><p>Any recommendations for software performance-related newsletters and curated content mailing lists?
