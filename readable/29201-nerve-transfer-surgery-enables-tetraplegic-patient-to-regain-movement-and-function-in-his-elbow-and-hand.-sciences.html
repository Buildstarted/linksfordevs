It has been awesome. I was was one of the first "young" candidates to have this done. I gained some function but nowhere near as much as this guy. I gained the ability to clinch my hands but does not give you any fine motor skills. I was able to grasp anything at all. I can now pick up to about 10 lbs depending on the shape. There is a reason the video shows him picking up a bottle, that is usually what we reach for the most. In my case, I can't extend my fingers like him, mainly just grasp. I would love to have that ability and I'm sure they have made advances since my surgery but I'll take what I can get. Just to let everyone know, it took about a year for the nerve to regenerate and become "rewired".</p></div></div></div></div>
