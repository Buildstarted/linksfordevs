		</p><h3><br>The best switches.</h3><p align="left">To put it bluntly, most ergonomic keyboards “cheap out” on their keyswitches.  They use rubber, instead of metal. Compromising here can ruin an otherwise good  keyboard.</p><p align="left">We’ve used the BEST keyswitches for typing... <a href="//matias.ca/switches/quiet">Matias Quiet&nbsp;Click mechanical switches</a>.</p><p align="left">Their ALPS-inspired design delivers generous amounts of tactile feedback, while providing enough resistance to support the weight of your hands —&nbsp;exactly what you need for fast, comfortable typing.</p><p align="left">Plus, unlike every other mechanical switch, they are quiet enough to use in office environments.  You don’t need to worry about disturbing your co-workers.</p><h3><br>Low Force option<br>also available.</h3><p align="left">For those who need (or prefer) typing with a lighter touch, a <b><i>Low&nbsp;Force Edition</i></b> of the Ergo Pro is also available.</p><p align="left">It uses <a href="//matias.ca/switches/linear">Matias Quiet&nbsp;Linear switches</a> for a smooth, low&nbsp;force feel.  These same switches are used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype">stenotype machines</a>, capable of typing speeds upwards of 225&nbsp;words per minute.</p><h3><br>A better<br>navigation cluster.
		</h3><p align="left">Navigation keys have always been a big problem for ergonomic keyboards.</p><p align="left">If you follow the standard, the keyboard is too wide.</p><p align="left">If you don’t follow the standard, there’s a long learning curve, and users are stuck having to suffer with an awkward, unfamiliar layout.</p><p align="center"><img src="resources/images/NavCluster_600.jpg" width="280" height="88" border="0" alt="Nav Cluster"></p><p align="left">We’ve designed a truly new and better navigation cluster —&nbsp;one that’s much closer to standard AND more ergonomic...
		
		</p><p align="left">We’ve arranged the navigation keys in their traditional pattern, but we laid them out <i>horizontally</i>, and then positioned them <a href="layouts">along the bottom row</a>, more like a laptop keyboard.</p><p align="left">It works beautifully, and the adjustment time is virtually zero.  Try it once, and you’ll never want to go back.</p><h3><br>Narrower than most<br>and<br>more comfortable<br>with a mouse.</h3><p align="left">Thanks to our unique navigation cluster, the Ergo&nbsp;Pro is not as wide as other ergonomic keyboards.  It’s not much wider than a laptop keyboard.</p><p align="left">This makes it much more comfortable to use with a mouse.  Since you’re not reaching as far for it, your elbow doesn’t need to flare out at an awkward angle.</p><h3><br>Leg supports<br>for tilting &amp; tenting.
		<p><img src="resources/images/Negative-TILT-animation_445x100.gif" width="280" height="63" border="0" alt="Negative Tilt"></p></h3><p align="left">As you would expect, the Ergo&nbsp;Pro comes equipped with leg supports for 9° tenting and 4.5° negative tilt.  It can also be used&nbsp;flat.</p><p align="center"><img src="resources/images/Tenting_890x200.jpg" width="280" height="63" border="0" alt="Tenting"></p><p align="left">For even greater adjustability, you can mount the two sides of the keyboard onto a pair of small <a target="_blank" href="//www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-709B-Table-Tripod-Black/dp/B0000YD2JC/">tabletop tripods</a> (any standard type).</p><h3><br>Spacious<br>palm supports.</h3><p align="left">The palm supports are big and comfortable.  Plus, they can be removed, if your desk already has palm supports built-in.</p><h3><br>Everything<br>is in the box.</h3><p align="left">We’ve included everything you need in the box.  There’s nothing extra to buy.  You are all ready to&nbsp;go.</p><p align="left">BUT if you did want to add a spot of color, we have replacement palm supports available <a href="//matias.ca/sku/palmsupports">in 4 gorgeous colors</a>.</p><p align="center"><img src="resources/images/PS403_640x360.jpg" width="280" height="158" border="0" alt="Color Palm Supports"></p><h3><br>Dedicated keys for...<br>Undo, Cut, Copy,<br>Paste.</h3><p align="left">We’ve added dedicated hotkeys for the 4 most important keyboard shortcuts —&nbsp;undo, cut, copy, and paste.  Best of all, no drivers are required.  Everything works, right out of the box.</p><h3><br>3 extra USB 2.0 ports.</h3><p align="left">Some keyboards have 2 USB ports — most have none.  We’re giving you three!  You can plug in flash drives, digital cameras, your mouse, and more.</p><h3><br>Laser etched keys.</h3><p align="left">All those symbols are handy, but what happens when they wear off? <br>They won't.  They're laser etched — burned into the keys with a laser — so they'll never wear off.</p><h3><br>Sculpted keytops.</h3><p align="left"><img src="resources/images/SculptedKeytops_240.jpg" alt="Key detail" width="120" height="120" align="right" border="0">The latest trend in keyboards is to have very flat &amp; wide keys, with little or no space between them.  You see this a lot on laptops and netbooks.  While they look great, they can also be a little tricky to type on.  The flatness makes it very easy to slide out of home row and lose your bearings.
		</p><p>The Ergo Pro bucks this trend.  It has traditional sculpted keytops, curved to fit your fingertips, and keep you from sliding out of home position.</p><h3><br>Audio &amp; media<br>controls.</h3><p align="left">By holding down the Fn key, you gain access to strategically placed keyboard shortcuts for Volume Up&nbsp;/&nbsp;Down, Mute, Pause&nbsp;/&nbsp;Play, Next&nbsp;Track, and Previous&nbsp;Track.</p><h3><br>Ghosts busted.</h3><p align="left">Most keyboards allow only a few keys to be pressed at once, so they can’t keep up with very fast typists. The result is called ghosting — letters missing from what you actually typed, or additional letters that you didn’t type.</p><p align="left">The Ergo&nbsp;Pro has special Anti-Ghosting Circuitry (also called n-key rollover) to eliminate these problems. You can type as fast as you’re able; the Ergo&nbsp;Pro will keep up.</p><br><br></div></div></div></div>
