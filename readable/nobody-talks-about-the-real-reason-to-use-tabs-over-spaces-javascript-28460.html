<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-click-id="text"><div theme="[object Object]"><p>hello,</p><p>i've been slightly dismayed, that in every tabs-vs-spaces debate i can find on the web, nobody is talking about the accessibility consequences for the visually impaired</p><p>let me illustrate with a quick story, why i irrevocably turned from a spaces to tabs guy</p><ul><li><p>i recently worked at a company that used tabs</p></li><li><p>i created a new repository, and thought i was being hip and modern, so i started to evangelize spaces for the 'consistency across environments'</p></li><li><p>i get approached by not one, but TWO coworkers who unfortunately are highly visually impaired,<br>and each has a different visual impairment</p><ul><li><p>one of them uses tab-width 1 because he uses such a gigantic font-size</p></li><li><p>the other uses tab-width 8 and a really wide monitor</p></li><li><p>these guys have serious problems using codebases with spaces, they have to convert, do their work, and then unconvert before committing</p></li><li><p>these guys are <em>not</em> just being fussy â€” it's almost surprising they can code at all, it's kind of sad to watch but also inspiring</p></li></ul></li><li><p>at that moment, i instantaneously conceded â€” there's just no counter-argument that even comes close to outweighing the accessibility needs of valued coworkers</p></li><li><p>'consistency across environments' is exactly the problem for these guys, they have different needs</p></li><li><p>just think of how rude and callous it would be to overrule these fellas needs for my precious "consistency when i post on stack overflow"</p></li><li><p>so what would you do, spaces people, if you were in charge? overrule their pleas?</p></li></ul><p>from that moment onward, i couldn't imagine writing code in spaces under the presumption that "nobody with visual impairment will ever need to work with this code, probably", it's just a ridiculous way to think, especially in open-source</p><p>i'll admit though, it's a pain posting tabs online and it gets bloated out with an unsightly default 8 tab-width â€” however, can't we see clearly that this is a deficiency with websites like github and stackoverflow and reddit here, where viewers are not easily able to configure their own preferred viewing tab-width? websites and web-apps obviously have the ability to set their own tab width via css, and so ultimately, aren't we all making our codebases worse as a workaround for the deficiencies in these websites we enjoy? why are these code-viewing apps missing basic code-viewing features?</p><p>in the tabs-vs-spaces debate, i see people saying "tabs lets us customize our tab-width", as though we do this "for fun" â€” but this is about meeting the real needs of real people who have real impairments â€” how is this not seen as a simple cut-and-dry accessibility issue?</p><p>i don't find this argument in online debates, and wanted to post there here out in the blue as a feeler, before i start ranting like this to my next group of coworkers ;)</p><p>is there really any reason, in favor of spaces, that counter balances the negative consequences for the visually impaired?</p><p>cheers friends,</p><p>ðŸ‘‹ Chase</p></div></div></div></div>
