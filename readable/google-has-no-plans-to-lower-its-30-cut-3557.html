<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-id="2022591" data-slug="2019-02-11-google-has-no-plans-to-lower-its-30-percent-cut" id="article-2022591"><header><p><h2>CEO maintains figure is the industry standard, despite Epic Games' efforts to bypass it</h2></p></header><main><p>Google will not be lowering the share it currently takes from mobile developers any time soon.</p><p>In an earnings call following the tech giant's latest financials, transcribed by <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4238032-alphabet-inc-cl-c-goog-ceo-sundar-pichai-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single">Seeking Alpha</a>, the executive team was asked whether this was the "right long-term rate for Google Play" after "large developers are starting to come up with... workarounds."</p><p>This is almost certainly a reference to Epic Games' decision last summer to release Fortnite on Android via a separate launcher rather than the official store, with founder Tim Sweeney telling <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> at the time <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-07-31-30-percent-store-tax-is-a-high-cost-says-sweeney-as-fortnite-skips-google-play">30% was "too high a cost"</a> for developers to stomach.</p><p>However, CEO Sundar Pichai disagrees, saying in the earnings call: "On Google Play... thousnads of developers rely on it to safely and seamlessly distribute their game to billions of Android users worldwide. And we invest a lot in our infrastructure to continuously make sure their overall experience is safe and results in high engagement and for the developer's back.</p><p>"So I think there's a value exchange there and it's been the industry standard. And so, I think we will continue down that path... but obviously always adapt to where the market is."</p><p>Pichai's comment on keeping experiences safe is likely a reference to an exploit the Android launcher for Fortnite suffered around launch. The bug <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-08-27-google-discloses-vulnerability-in-fortnite-launcher-that-allowed-possible-malware-installation">enabled hackers to install malware on users' devices</a> -- something Google disclosed publicly, despite Sweeney's claims this was "irresponsible".</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-02-07-zynga-ceo-its-too-early-to-tell-if-more-will-follow-epics-anti-app-store-stance">Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau said it was "too early to tell"</a> whether Fortnite's byspassing of the Google Play store fee was the start of a trend.</p><p>Epic has since furthered its stance that store fees should be lower with the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-12-04-epic-launching-store-with-88-percent-revenue-share-for-developers">launch of the Epic Games Store</a>, which only takes 12% of developers' sales compared to the usual 30% -- and is even <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-01-10-epic-games-store-planned-for-launch-on-android-this-year">planning to bring it to Android later this year</a>.</p><p>Of course, it's easier to offer such generous revenue share when you have money pouring in from a global phenomenon such as Fortnite. On iOS alone, the game has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-02-08-fortnite-ios-revenue-estimated-at-usd500-million">generated more than $500 million</a> -- and has done so faster than Clash Royale and Honor of Kings.</p></main></article></div></div>
