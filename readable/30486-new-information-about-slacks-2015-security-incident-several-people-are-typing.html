    <h1>New information about Slack&#x27;s 2015 security incident - Several People Are Typing</h1>
    <div class="o-wrap--article"><p><i>Read this post in&#xA0;<a href="http://www.slackhq.com/nouvelles-revelations-incident-2015">French</a>,&#xA0;<a href="https://slackhq.com/neue-informationen-vorfall-2015">German</a>,&#xA0;<a href="https://slackhq.com/intl-ja-jp-new-information-2015-incident">Japanese</a>, and&#xA0;<a href="http://slackhq.com/nueva-informacion-acerca-del-incidente-de-seguridad-2015">Spanish</a>.</i></p>
<p><span>In response to new information about our 2015 security incident (explained </span><a href="https://slackhq.com/march-2015-security-incident-and-the-launch-of-two-factor-authentication"><span>here</span></a><span> at the time), we are resetting passwords for approximately 1% of Slack accounts. This announcement affects you only if you:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>created your account </span><i><span>before</span></i><span> March 2015,</span></li>
<li><span>AND have not changed your password since,</span></li>
<li><span>AND your account does not require logging in via a single-sign-on (SSO) provider.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In other words, if you&#x2019;re one of the approximately 99% who joined Slack after March 2015 </span><i><span>or</span></i><span> changed your password since then, this announcement does </span><b>not</b><span> apply to you.</span></p>
<h3><b>2015</b></h3>
<p><span>In 2015, unauthorized individuals gained access to some Slack infrastructure, including a database that stored user profile information including usernames and irreversibly encrypted, or &#x201C;hashed,&#x201D; passwords. The attackers also inserted code that allowed them to capture plaintext passwords as they were entered by users at the time.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>Immediately following the incident, we reset passwords for the small number of Slack users we confirmed to be affected. We also encouraged all users to reset their passwords and immediately implemented corrective and preventive security measures, including two-factor authentication. </span><span>We have not detected any compromise of our infrastructure since this 2015 incident, which affected Slack and a handful of other companies.</span></p>
<h3><b>2019</b></h3>
<p><span>We were recently contacted through our bug bounty program with information about potentially compromised Slack credentials. These types of reports are fairly routine and usually the result of malware or password re-use between services, which we believed to be the case here.</span></p>
<p><span>We immediately confirmed that a portion of the email addresses and password combinations were valid, reset those passwords, and explained our actions to the affected users. However, as more information became available and our investigation continued, we determined that the majority of compromised credentials were from accounts that logged in to Slack during the 2015 security incident.</span></p>
<h3><b>What we are doing now</b></h3>
<p><span>Today we are resetting passwords for all accounts that were active at the time of the 2015 incident, with the exception of accounts that use SSO or with passwords changed after March 2015. We have no reason to believe that any of these accounts were compromised, but we believe that this precaution is worth any inconvenience the reset may cause. However, we do recognize that this is inconvenient for affected users, and we apologize.</span></p>
