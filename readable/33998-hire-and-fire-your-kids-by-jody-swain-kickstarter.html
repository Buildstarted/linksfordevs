</strong>We've had a lot of interest with the media, pitched on Dragon's Den - episode airs Thursday October 24th at 9pm and other media found here: <a href="https://hireandfireyourkids.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://hireandfireyourkids.com/media</a>. &nbsp;Our name definitely intrigues people and captures attention! &nbsp;We plan to use the money to launch a marketing campaign and work with influencers, experts, educators and the media alike to expand across the Country promoting Hire and Fire your Kids and driving the brand awareness. &nbsp;We have already had behavioural analysts, psycologists, behavioural consultants, social workers and Registered Early Childhood Educators who have recommended Hire and Fire your Kids. &nbsp;As well as numerous testimonials from our "test families" <a href="https://hireandfireyourkids.com/testimonials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://hireandfireyourkids.com/testimonials</a> . &nbsp;The more eyes we can get on us the better! We need to share how this digital "real world" game played between parents and Kids can help reduce family friction and help prepare more Kids with the skills they'll need to function sucessfully when they get out on their own. &nbsp;I've gained connections with key players in the media space and mommy influencers. &nbsp;Plan to execute a press release to generate some earned media though GTA publications, radio, magazines, podcasts, tradeshows etc. and continue to work it across Canada this Fall!</p><p><strong>WHO AM I?</strong> &nbsp;I am a Mom of` 5 in a blended family ages ranging from 4-23. &nbsp;I'm extremely hard working and dedicated to success. &nbsp;I am beyond ready to take this App to the next level. &nbsp;Being a first time entrepreneur my life has done a complete 180 and I've never been more passionate about anything in my life. &nbsp;I've changed and grown so much as a person, facing my fears and putting myself out there. &nbsp;I can't wait to see Hire and Fire your Kids grow! &nbsp;Please know that your investment is in good hands. &nbsp;The high performance during my retail career and my strong work ethic will ensure this app is a success. &nbsp;Please feel free to check out the LinkedIn recommendations from people who have worked with me to give you a better idea of who I am as leader and person. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jody-swain-94837321/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jody-swain-94837321/</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Join us &amp; be a part of the Hire and Fire your Kids journey!</p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hireandfireyourkids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.facebook.com/hireandfireyourkids/</a></p><p>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hireandfireyourkids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.instagram.com/hireandfireyourkids/</a></p><p>Are you "Ready to Play?"</p><p>Thank you for your consideration in helping us make your lives a &nbsp;little easier, reduce family friction and prepare more Kids to be successful individuals in the "real world"! &nbsp;We appreciate your time and any little bit you can offer :)</p><p><a href="https://hireandfireyourkids.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://hireandfireyourkids.com/</a></p><p>Please take some time to read through some testimonials...</p></div></div></div></div>
