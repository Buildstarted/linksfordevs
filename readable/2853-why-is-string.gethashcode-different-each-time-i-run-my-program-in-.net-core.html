I then look at <em>why</em> that's the case and why it's a good thing in general. Finally, if you need to ensure <code>GetHashCode()</code> gives the same value every time you run your program (spoiler: generally you don't), then I provide an alternative implementation you can use in place of the built-in <code>GetHashCode()</code>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>tl;dr;</strong> I strongly suggest reading the whole post, but if you're just here for the deterministic <code>GetHashCode()</code>, <a href="#a-deterministic-gethashcode-implementation">then see below</a>.

</code></pre><p>This took me totally by surprise, and was the source of a bug that I couldn't get my head around without this knowledge (I'll come to that later). </p><h2 id="since-when-was-this-a-thing-" class="heading-with-anchor">Since when was this a thing?!<a href="#since-when-was-this-a-thing-"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>I was gobsmacked when I discovered this behaviour, so I went rooting around in the docs and on GitHub. Sure enough, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.gethashcode">right there in the docs, this behaviour is well documented</a>: (emphasis mine)</p><blockquote><p>The hash code itself is not guaranteed to be stable. Hash codes for identical strings can differ across .NET implementations, across .NET versions, and across .NET platforms (such as 32-bit and 64-bit) for a single version of .NET. In some cases, they can even differ by application domain. <strong>This implies that two subsequent runs of the same program may return different hash codes.</strong></p></blockquote><p>In many ways, the interesting thing about this behaviour is that I've never run into it before. My first thought was that I must have depended on this behaviour in .NET Framework, but after a bit more consideration, I couldn't think of a single instance where this was the case. As it turns out, I've always used <code>GetHashCode()</code> in the manner for which it was designed. Who would have thought it!</p><p>The key point is that the hash codes are deterministic <em>for a given program execution</em>, that means the <em>only</em> time it'll be an issue is if you're saving the hash code outside of a process, and loading it into another one. That explains the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.gethashcode">subsequent comment in the documentation</a>: </p><blockquote><p>As a result, hash codes should never be used outside of the application domain in which they were created, they should never be used as key fields in a collection, and they should never be persisted.</p></blockquote><p>When I discovered the behaviour I was trying to save the output of <code>string.GetHashCode()</code> to a file, and load the values in another process. This is clearly a no-no given the previous warning!</p><p>As a bit of an aside, it's actually possible to enable the randomised hash code behaviour in .NET Framework too. To do so, you <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/userandomizedstringhashalgorithm-element">enable the <code>&lt;UseRandomizedStringHashAlgorithm&gt;</code> element in the application's <em>app.config</em></a>:</p><pre class="language-xml"><code class="language-xml"><span class="token prolog">&lt;?xml version ="1.0"?&gt;</span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>configuration</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>runtime</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>UseRandomizedStringHashAlgorithm</span><span class="token attr-name">enabled</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>1<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">/&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>runtime</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>configuration</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>This enables the same randomization code used by .NET Core to be used with .NET Framework. In fact, if you look at <a href="https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/string.cs,833">the .NET Framework 4.7.2 Reference Source for <em>string.cs</em></a>, you'll see that <code>GetHashCode()</code> looks like the following:</p><pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">public</span><span class="token keyword">override</span><span class="token keyword">int</span><span class="token function">GetHashCode</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token preprocessor property">#<span class="token directive keyword">if</span> FEATURE_RANDOMIZED_STRING_HASHING</span><span class="token keyword">if</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>HashHelpers<span class="token punctuation">.</span>s_UseRandomizedStringHashing<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token keyword">return</span><span class="token function">InternalMarvin32HashString</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>Length<span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token preprocessor property">#<span class="token directive keyword">endif</span></span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>The call to <code>InternalMarvin32HashString</code> calls into native code to do the randomized hashing. The Marvin algorithm it uses <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20130262421">is actually patented</a>, but if you're interested you can see a <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/e2bcca7d9d0e36510eaba9b1028e16a5de39cee9/src/System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/Marvin.cs">C# version here (it's part of the Core CLR implementation)</a>. I believe the randomized hashing feature was introduced in .NET Framework 4.5 (but don't quote me on that!).</p><p>Once I'd figured out that randomized hashing was my concern, I naturally checked to see if it could be disabled. It turns out in .NET Core it's <em>always</em> enabled. But why?</p><h2 id="why-is-randomizing-gethashcode-a-good-thing-" class="heading-with-anchor">Why is randomizing <code>GetHashCode()</code> a good thing?<a href="#why-is-randomizing-gethashcode-a-good-thing-"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>The answer to this question was touched on by Stephen Toub <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/30994#issuecomment-404328685">in a comment on an issue</a> I discovered while reading around my problem:</p><blockquote><p>Q: Why .NET Core utilize randomized string hashing?<br>A: Security, prevention against DoS attacks, etc.</p></blockquote><p>This piqued my interest - what were these DoS attacks, and how do they play into <code>GetHashCode()</code>?</p><p>As far as I can see, this harks back to <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4680.en.html">a talk given at the end of 2011 at the 28th Chaos Communication Congress (28C3)</a>, in which a whole range of languages were shown to be susceptible to a technique known as "hash flooding". If you're interested in the details, I strongly recommend checking out the video of the talk which I was impressed to find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Cq3CLI6H8">on You Tube</a>. It definitely went over my head in places, but I'll try and explain the crux of it here.</p><h3 id="hash-tables-and-hash-flooding" class="heading-with-anchor">Hash tables and hash flooding<a href="#hash-tables-and-hash-flooding"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h3><blockquote><p>Disclaimer: I don't have a Computer Science degree, so I may well be a bit fast and loose with the correct terminology here. Hopefully this description of the vulnerability makes sense either way.</p></blockquote><p>Hash tables are a data structure that allow you to store a <em>value</em> using a <em>key</em>. The hash table itself consists of many buckets. When you want to insert a value in a hash table you use a <em>hash function</em> to calculate which <em>bucket</em> the <em>key</em> corresponds to, and store the key-value pair in there. </p><picture><source srcset="/content/images/p/hash_buckets_0.svg" type="image/svg+xml"><img src="/content/images/p/hash_buckets_0.png" alt="Storing a value in a hash bucket"></picture><p>In the best case, inserting a value into a hash table is an <code>O(1)</code> operation, i.e. it takes constant time. Ideally a hash function distributes the keys among the buckets evenly, such that each bucket has at most 1 value stored in it. If so, it doesn't matter how many values you store, it always takes the same amount of time to store a value. Even better, deleting and retrieving a value are also <code>O(1)</code>.</p><p>Where things fall down is if two different keys hash to the same bucket. This is a relatively common occurrence: typical hash functions used with hash tables are designed to be fast, and to give a fixed output. They try to give a low probability of collisions, but they're not cryptographic hash functions (these provide stronger guarantees. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Cq3CLI6H8#t=07m28s">See 7:28 in the YouTube video for more discussion of this</a>).</p><p>When you get a hash collision in a hash table, typical implementations store the key-value pairs as a linked list inside the bucket. When you're inserting a new value and you get a collision, the hash table checks each of the elements to see if it already exists in the bucket. If not, then it adds the element to the end of the list. </p><picture><source srcset="/content/images/p/hash_buckets_1.svg" type="image/svg+xml"><img src="/content/images/p/hash_buckets_1.png" alt="Collisions in a hash table"></picture><p>This is fine when you only get the occasional collision, but what if <em>every</em> lookup results in a collision. Imagine your hash table is asked to insert 10,000 elements, each of which has a different key, but which <em>all</em> hash to the same bucket.</p><p>The first element, <code>Foo</code> is inserted quickly, as there's no previous values in the bucket. The second element, <code>Bar</code> takes a little longer as it's first compared to the existing <code>Foo</code> element stored in the bucket's linked list, before being added to the end of the list. The third element <code>Baz</code> takes even longer, as it's compared to each of the previously hashed values before being added to the list. </p><picture><source srcset="/content/images/p/hash_buckets_2.svg" type="image/svg+xml"><img src="/content/images/p/hash_buckets_2.png" alt="Hash flooding resulting in polynomial slowdown"></picture><p>Each individual insertion takes <code>O(n)</code> time, as it must be compared to every existing value in the linked list. If you can find values <code>Foo</code>, <code>Bar</code>, <code>Baz</code> etc. which <em>all</em> hash to the same value, then the time to insert those <code>n</code> elements is <em>polynomial</em><code>O(n²)</code> time. That's a far cry from the <code>O(1)</code> assumed-best-case performance, and is the essence of the hash flooding attack.</p><h3 id="hash-flooding-and-web-applications" class="heading-with-anchor">Hash flooding and web applications<a href="#hash-flooding-and-web-applications"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h3><p>So that explains the attack itself, but why is it an issue? For two main reasons:</p><p>In their talk, <a href="https://twitter.com/alech">Alexander Klink</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zeri42">Julian Wälde</a> describe attacks on multiple web application frameworks, including ASP.NET (non-Core - this is 2011 remember!). Most web application frameworks (including ASP.NET) read an HTTP POST's parameters into a hash table. In ASP.NET, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httprequest.form?view=netframework-4.7.2">the parameters for a request are available as a <code>NameValueCollection</code> (a hash table) on <code>HttpContext.Request.Form</code></a>.</p><p>Using knowledge of the <code>GetHashCode()</code> implementation, it's possible to calculate (or identify using brute force) a wide array of values that will collide. From there you can craft a malicious HTTP POST. For example, if <code>Foo</code>, <code>Bar</code>, <code>Baz</code> all give the same <code>GetHashCode()</code> value, you can create a malicious post that uses all of these parameters in the body:</p><pre class="language-http"><code class="language-http">POST / HTTP/1.1
 example.com
 application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 9999999

Foo=1&amp;Bar=1&amp;Baz=1.... + Lots more collisions
</code></pre><p>When the ASP.NET application tries to create the <code>HttpContext</code> object, it dutifully decomposes the body into a <code>NameValueCollection</code>, triggering the hash flooding attack due to the hash collisions. </p><p>For a bit of perspective here, when Alexander and Julian tested the attack with 4MB of post data (the limit at the time), it took the CPU <strong>~11 hours</strong> to complete the hashing. 😱 <code>O(n²)</code> is a bitch…</p><blockquote><p>Obviously there were built-in mitigations to this sort of runaway, even at the time; IIS would limit you to 90s of CPU time. But it shouldn't be hard to see the potential for denial of service attacks.</p></blockquote><p>So there you have it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Cq3CLI6H8#t=29m56s">It seems Microsoft took this research and vulnerability very seriously</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Cq3CLI6H8#t=26m10s">unlike the PhP folks by the sound of it!</a>). They initially limited the number of parameters you can pass in a request, to reduce the impact of the issue. Subsequently they introduced the randomised <code>GetHashCode()</code> behaviour we've been discussing.</p><h2 id="what-if-you-need-gethashcode-to-be-deterministic-across-program-executions-" class="heading-with-anchor">What if you need GetHashCode() to be deterministic across program executions?<a href="#what-if-you-need-gethashcode-to-be-deterministic-across-program-executions-"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>Which brings me full circle to the problem. I wanted a deterministic <code>GetHashCode()</code> that would work across program executions. If you find yourself in a similar situation, you should maybe stop going down that line. </p><p>Do you <em>really</em> need it?</p><p>If the <code>GetHashCode()</code> result is going to be exposed to the outside world in a manner that leaves you open to hash flooding, you should probably rethink your approach. In particular, if user input is being added to a hash table (just like the <code>Request.Form</code> property), then you're vulnerable to the attack. </p><p>As well as the attack I've discussed here, I strongly suggest reading some of Eric Lippert's posts on <code>GetHashCode()</code>. They're old, but totally relevant. I wish I'd found them earlier in my investigation!</p><p>If you're really, <em>really</em>, sure you want a deterministic <code>GetHashCode()</code> for strings then you'll have to do your own thing.</p><h2 id="a-deterministic-gethashcode-implementation" class="heading-with-anchor">A deterministic <code>GetHashCode()</code> implementation<a href="#a-deterministic-gethashcode-implementation"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>In my case, I'm Pretty Sure™ that I'm ok to use a deterministic <code>GetHashCode()</code>. Essentially, I'm calculating the hash code for a whole bunch of strings "offline", and persisting these values to disk. In the application itself, I'm comparing a user provided string to the existing hash codes. I'm not <em>inserting</em> these values into a hash table, just comparing them to the already "full" hash table. so I think I'm good. </p><blockquote><p>Please tell me if I'm wrong!</p></blockquote><p>Coming up with a deterministic <code>GetHashCode()</code> implementation was an interesting dive into all sorts of code bases:</p><p>In the end, I settled on a version somewhere between all of them. I didn't want to use <code>unsafe</code> code in my little application (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/a10890f4ffe0fadf090c922578ba0e606ebdd16c/src/Common/src/System/Text/StringOrCharArray.cs#L140">like the CoreFX version uses</a>), so I created a managed version instead.

If anyone knows the answer for sure I'd be very interested, otherwise I need to go and test some!</p><p>As I stated previously, generally speaking you shouldn't need to use this code. You should only use it in very specific circumstances where you know you aren't vulnerable to hash-based attacks. </p><blockquote><p>If you're looking to implement <code>GetHashCode()</code> for <em>other</em> types, take a look at <a href="https://rehansaeed.com/gethashcode-made-easy/">Muhammad Rehan Saeed's post</a>. He describes a helper struct for generating hash codes. He also discusses the built-in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.hashcode?view=netcore-2.1"><code>HashCode</code> struct</a> in .NET Core 2.1. </p></blockquote><h2 id="summary" class="heading-with-anchor">Summary<a href="#summary"><img aria-hidden="true" src="/assets/img/icons-link.svg"></a></h2><p>This post was representative of my journey into understanding <code>string.GetHashCode()</code> and why different executions of a program will give a different hash code for the same string. Randomized hash codes is a security feature, designed to mitigate hash flooding. This type of attack uses knowledge of the underlying hash function to generate many collisions. Due to typical hash table design, this causes insert performance to drop from <code>O(1)</code> to <code>O(n²)</code>, resulting in a denial of service attack. </p><p>In some circumstances, where your hash table will not be exposed to hash-based attacks like this, it may be desirable to have a stable/deterministic hash function. In this post I showed one such possible hash function, based on implementations in .NET Framework and CoreFX. This hash function ensures you get the same hash code for a given string, across program executions. </p><p>Use it wisely - with great power…</p></div></div></div></div>
