The capability has been linked to the release of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/">iOS 14</a> by rising Apple leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1252187152831692800?s=20">Jon Prosser</a>, and if true, it would enable full-scale app development to take place on Apple's mobile devices for the first time.</p>

However, Xcode is a complex app and has only ever been available on Mac. While Apple offers the Swift Playgrounds app for learning about coding on mobile, it has never indicated that it has any plans to bring Xcode to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.</p>
<p>But according to a tweet posted on Monday by Prosser, Xcode "is present on iOS/<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados/">iPadOS</a> 14," the implications of which are "huge" because it "opens the door for 'Pro' applications to come to ‌iPad‌."</p>
<p>Responding to Prosser's tweet, iOS developer and MacRumors writer Steve Moser <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1252197252887707650?s=20">noted</a> that a hidden Xcode Preview app is present in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-13/">iOS 13</a> that acts as a companion app for showing layout previews on device from the main Xcode Mac app. However, Prosser appears to be referring to the existence of a native full-fat version of Xcode for ‌iPad‌. </p>

</center><p>Such a step would be a big undertaking for Apple, requiring an overhaul of Xcode's interface to take advantage of the ‌iPad‌'s primarily touch-based operating system. If successful though, it could make full-scale app development a possibility for mobile users who don't have a Mac. </p>
<p>Hopefully we'll hear more at this year's virtual Worldwide Developers Conference, where Apple will reveal annual updates to all of its operating systems, including its plans for ‌iOS 14‌ and ‌iPadOS‌ 14.</p>
