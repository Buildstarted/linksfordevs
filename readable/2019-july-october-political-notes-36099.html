<p>
The GM workers' strike <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/30/general-motors-gm-strike-future-work-collective-action">was a victory</a>, part of a trend toward more
labor militancy.

Thousands of tourists <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/30/meme-tourism-has-turned-the-world-into-the-seventh-circle-of-selfie-hell">photograph themselves on a stairway</a> just because
it was a movie set.  How foolish.

</p><p>
The fact that thousands of people do something for no reason
is not a reason for you to do it.  If you do do it, you will
experience a sensation of "So what?"

</p><p>
Best of all, don't have an Instagram account, and you will avoid being
influenced by "influencers."  Remember, Instagram is another tentacle
of Facebook.  Don't be a zucker!

Was it wrong to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/30/was-it-wrong-for-baseball-fans-to-chant-lock-him-up-at-trump">greet the conman</a> with chants of "Lock him up"?

</p><p>
I think he asked for it, very directly.

<p>
Pinochet's privatization of old-age pensions <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/pinochet-economic-model-current-crisis-chile">is still impoverishing Chile</a>.  Chile needs to tax the rich more.

</p><p>
We must also strictly regulate private use of face recognition.

</p><p>

"Thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and Europe’s velvet

</p><p>
I don't like to use the word "populists" for right-wing extremists.

<p>
Republicans <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/10/29/republicans-accuse-colonel-vindman-jew-fled-soviet-persecution-dual-loyalty/">are trying to smear Colonel Vindman</a> by questioning his loyalty
to the US.

</p><p>
Vindman was born in the Soviet Union, and moved to the US at age 3 as
a refugee, with his family.

</p><p>
It is characteristic of right-wing politicians to accuse their
opponents (or anyone that doesn't serve them) of the wrongs that they
themselves commit.  Today's Republicans' primary allegiance is to the
conman, not the US.

<p>
The House of Representatives <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/29/us-house-overwhelmingly-votes-to-recognize-armenian-genocide">adopted a resolution</a> condemning the
genocide of the Armenians.

</p><p>
In and of itself, this is the right thing to do.  It would be wrong,
however, <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/hrant-dink.html">to impose censorship on what others say about this question</a>, as both Turkey and France do.

</p><p>
It won't hamper Erdoğan's attack on the Kurds, but it is a setback for
his policy.

<p>
The harsh reaction to Hong Kong protests <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/29/hong-kongs-reluctant-policeman-its-not-for-us-to-deliver-punishment">is splitting the thug department</a> between the thugs and the police officers.

and less global heating, as that will be over coming decades.  But we

<p>
Craig Murray attended a preparatory court session about extraditing
Julian Assange, and reports that Assange is 
<a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2019/10/assange-in-court/">aging
rapidly and seems mentally dazed</a> — like torture victims
Murray has seen.
</p><p>
Assange's lawyers were unable to talk with him until a week before the
hearing, and asked for a delay so they could present their case
properly.  The UK magistrate refused, apparently insisting on a
schedule imposed by the US.
</p><p>
This schedule may prevent evidence from a Spanish court, which is
investigating a CIA plan to kidnap Assange, from being considered in
the extradition hearing.
</p><p>
The actual extradition hearing will be held in a place nearly
inaccessible to the public, so that the UK can violate Assange's
rights without any reporting of it.

</p><p>
It takes a great spirit to respond to torture by rising above hatred.
Most people are not so gifted. So they are likely to respond to
torture by seeking revenge.  Just as people who were abused as
children often abuse other children, people who experienced torture
may turn to torture themselves.

<p>
US citizens: <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/sign-now-to-tell-government-officials-make-big-polluters-pay-to-fix-the-climate-catastrophe-theyve-caused?nowrapper=true%20&amp;referrer=group-350org-joint&amp;source=350org-joint">call for making</a> fossil fuel companies financially
responsible for the damage they cause through <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#global%20heating">global heating</a>.

</p><p>
To literally make them pay for the damage is impossible.  The damage
will be a large fraction of the total wealth of humanity.  Perhaps as
little as 30%.  Perhaps as much as 99%.  Either way, it is far more
than the money that will pass through these fossil fuel companies'
hands.  If we sued them for those damages, we'd end up owning the
fossil fuel companies but still not compensated for the damage.

</p><p>
Moreover, by the time those damages fully occur, there may be no functioning
legal system to sue them in.

</p><p>
So the reason to do this is <em>not</em> to make them "pay for the damage".
It is to give them a pressing reason to stop doing the damage.

I don't see anything wrong with doing this.  At the same time,
we must reject the idea that every flood defense must be profitable

it extract too much from the public.  To get a good deal with businesses
you must always be ready to say "no deal".

The best flood defenses will work only for a few decades.  Beyond that,

</p><p>
One of the valid reasons for them to be angry at older people is for
having made so many people under 24.  It is hard to give a good life,
in a sustainable way, to such a large population.  Our population
<a href="https://stallman.org/articles/children.html">is living unsustainably and it is still increasing</a>.
 
</p><p>
This is one underlying cause of many of the specific hardships that
people are protesting about.  The other underlying cause is
inequality, which protects the privileged (and especially the
wealthy) from these hardships by dumping them entirely onto the
disprivileged and the poor.

</p><p>
Reducing inequality is a just cause, but we also need to reduce the
cost of our existence, and doing that without making everyone poor
will be much easier if we have fewer humans in the future.

</p><p>
Let's aim for 25% or less of the population under age 24.

moving.  This should be the priority target of the investigation.

There are many systematic forms of hate, but hatred of the poor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/19/hate-doesnt-only-exist-at-societies-extremist-edges-its-how-we-run-our-politics">may be the biggest</a>.

</p><p>
Hatred and phobia are different things.  A phobia is an intense,
irrational fear.  People who are afraid of heights or small places do
not hate them; conversely, people who hate the poor do not fear them
(though they may feel disgust, which is not the same).

</p><p>
To avoid building confusion, let's not refer to systems of hatred as
"phobias".  I disapprove of antigayism, antimuslimism and
antitransism, but I reject the terms "homophobia", "islamophobia" or
"transphobia".

</p><p>
Another systemic form of hatred, which the article cites an example of
but doesn't discuss, is hatred of atheists.  In the domain of
religion, atheists are the most hated group.  We should oppose
antiathism (short for antiatheistism) as well as antimuslimism and
antisemitism.

Zero-tolerance at work: a student called a school security guard, who
is black, "nigger".  The guard said, quite properly, "Don't call me
nigger."

guard was fired for this</a>.
</p><p>
The guard did not <em>use</em> that word.  Rather,
he <em>mentioned</em> it, to oppose its use.  I can't believe that the
school officials fail to understand the difference — of course
they understand it, just as you do.  So why the absurd decision?  I
suspect they have bought into the idea of rigidity as virtue, which is
the root of zero tolerance.

</p><p>
I think this proposal confusingly connects two good ideas.
</p><p>
We should adopt Medicare for All, also known as a universal national
medical system, but we should reject the idea that this is an increase
in expenses.  If we get rid of the parasitic profitmaking medical
system, this will save people in the US a

fraction of what they now spend on medical care and insurance</a>.  So
it doesn't need to be "paid for"; what it needs is to rechannel part
of the current spending.
</p><p>
We should cut the arms budget, because many of the arms being
purchased are 
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2017-may-aug.html#17_July_2017_(Spending_billions_on_weapons)">wasteful, or even

It turns out that Admiral Nelson, Britain's greatest naval hero, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/22/toppling-statues-nelsons-column-should-be-next-slavery">was
also a defender of slavery</a>.  Does that mean his statues should be taken down?

</p><p>
It is impossible to compare the evil Nelson did by defending slavery
with the good he did by helping to defeat Napoleon to see which is
more important.  That is imponderable.  But we can be sure that
Nelson, who died in 1805, had no say over how Britain treated es-slave
black sailors after the war ended in 1814.

</p><p>
Statues of Confederate generals were put up to glorify the past system
of slavery, aiming to strengthen the system of segregation.  That is
what those statues stand for.  I think they should be taken down.

</p><p>
By contrast, statues of Nelson were put up as symbols of naval
victory, and that is what they stand for.  They don't stand for any
position on race relations.  I don't think there is a need to take
them down, even though British naval power is a thing of the past.

that he was indeed arrested.)
</p><p>
It is misguided, even unfair, to criticize Extinction Rebellion for
being "too white" or "too male" or too whatever of that kind, because
that is not their choice.  A volunteer activity must to go with those
that volunteer.  When an activity needs to recruit as many people as
possible, it would be self-defeating to reject some volunteers for the
sake of demographic balance.  Rather, the activity must seek, and
welcome, every volunteer that is willing and able to work for the
cause.
</p><p>
If you would like more blacks or more women to participate in
Extinction Rebellion, by all means try to recruit them.  But don't
criticize the campaign for doing the most it can with the people who
have volunteered.
</p><p>
Indeed, people from less privileged groups may have rational reasons
to hold back.  Maybe they have to work 50 hours a week to get by.
Maybe they expect the judicial system to treat them with bias.  Maybe
they can't afford bail and fear being

</p><p>
The EU has a democratic structure that doesn't give the people much
power to limit what the <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#bankster">banksters</a> and businesses want.  Look, for
instance, at the unjust copyright directive that was adopted under
pressure from the publishing lobby.  Since three branches of the EU

</p><p>
The weakness of the latter is that the rich can organize the middle

</p><p>
As for the waste of subsidizing a few rich people along with the many
non-rich, it will be a small fraction of the total cost of these
programs.  A progressive tax on the rich will easily make up for it.

to refer to each other person by per specified pronouns</a>.

</p><p>
Paraphrasing to avoid pronouns is forbidden; people are required to get
practice using all sorts of pronouns.

</p><p>
The rule was received with tremendous hostility.

I have never used in StackExchange and wasn't thinking of doing so.
(Too busy, in any case.)  I don't even know whether it is possible to
post on the site without running nonfree Javascript software — if it
isn't, I urge you to reject posting there, for your freedom's sake.

</p><p>
But I reject the demand to speak or write with singular "they".
<a href="https://stallman.org/articles/genderless-pronouns.html">I have a better system for gender-neutrality in English</a>, and I will use that.

</p><p>
I hope others will take it up; I suggest you consider it.
But I don't claim the power to demand you use it.

If you do participate in StackExchange, you might choose unusual
pronouns for yourself.  Not absurd ones, or nasty ones, just unusual.

<p>
A family of British tourists in Canada were
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/15/uk-family-arrested-in-us-for-inadvertently-crossing-border">arrested
for entering the US on an road with no warning of the frontier</a>.
They were taking a short detour to avoid an animal in their intended
road.
</p><p>
This incident puts the sadism of the border <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> in clear relief.
Why arrest people for entering the US such a short time?
Why not wait a minute and see if they leave again?
</p><p>
Why deport them to the UK instead of back to Canada where they were?
In addition to the trouble that causes them, it will also cost the US
government a lot of money — perhaps tens of thousands of
dollars.  We see that, to the border <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a>, a chance to be cruel is
worth any expense.
</p><p>
It is clear that the <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> are looking closely at that road.  If
temporary entry there is deemed a real problem, why not put a sign
there telling people not to cross?  That would have been cheaper, but
the <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> would have missed a possible opportunity for sadism.
</p><p>
This is in addition to the cruel conditions that the <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> have
arranged to visit on tens of thousands of people who knew they were
entering the US, simply by overcrowding the immigration prisons.
</p><p>
British tourists are not the intended target of this cruelty.  It was
set up to deter, and endanger, refugees from Central America.  But now
that cruelty is their priority goal. the most zealous grab any
opportunity that comes their way.

<p>
The Swedish parliament is considering a constitutional amendment that
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/10/08/european-first-proposed-constitutional-amendment-sweden-would-enshrine-rights-nature">would
grant a personified "Nature" the rights to "exist, flourish,
regenerate, and evolve."</a>
</p><p>
I am in favor of making ecocide a crime, and also other acts that
greatly reduce habitats or the world's greenhouse gas capture.
I can't agree that "Nature" is capable of having rights.
</p><p>
I am specifically worried by the mention of "evolve" in that list.
Evolution has no target; it means that things change however they
happen to change.  If "Nature" has a right to evolve, that seems to
mean a right not to be shaped intentionally by humans.  That could
possibly lead to prohibiting efforts to eradicate intrusive species,
even efforts to keep them out.
</p><p>
In the US, it is humans that want to stop kudzu, zebra mussels, Asian
carp, Burmese pythons and many more introduced species from wiping out
other species.  In evolution, such things happen, and the fact that
human activity introduced those species into the US doesn't alter the
fact that they are present now.
</p><p>
Would "Nature's" "right to evolve" cover viruses such as smallpox and
polio, or the protozoa that cause malaria and sleeping sickness?
Let's not risk it.

Ironically, the "emergency" law that the Hong Kong puppet government
is using was imposed on its colony by the UK.  Hong Kong did not have
a democratic government until the absence of democracy there
embarrassed the UK, which was criticizing China for planning to deny
democracy to Hong Kong.

</p><p>
In such situations, it is a fundamental mistake to compare the wrongs
of two parties.  Rather, we should hold each one responsible.  The UK
should have given Hong Kong a democratic government much earlier, but
that lateness doesn't excuse what China has done to make democracy a

Ecuador is paralyzed by protests over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/03/ecuador-state-of-emergency-fuel-subsidies-protest">an end to fuel subsidies</a>.

</p><p>
Subsidies for fossil fuels boost the consumption of fossil fuels,
just as taxes on them reduce consumption.  Thus, it is vitally
important to eliminate all subsidies to fossil fuels, whether
at the retail level, the extraction level, or the transport level.

</p><p>
However, for poor people this is not merely an incentive to conserve,
it can ruin them immediately.  Therefore, it is important to protect
the poor from this effect.  One way is to distribute the subsidy money
to the poor in some other way.  It can also help to taper off the
subsidy rather than cut it abruptly.

</p><p>
Why did Ecuador do it the cruel way?  The answer is two acronyms long:
"US, IMF".  President Moreno accepted US dominion, the US pushed
Ecuador to surrender to the IMF, and the IMF aims (as usual) to crush
the poor.

"I was scammed by a fraud so ingenious even bank staff were fooled."

</p><p>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/oct/03/fraud-metro-bank">Source</a>

</p><p>
If the bank staff are fooled by the fraud, the bank should have to make
good the loss.

</p><p>
That's how it used to be.  It was the bank's responsibility to detect
and stop fraud, not the customer's.  If the bank failed to do this,
the loss was to the bank.

</p><p>
With internet banking, banks redefined this.  Instead of "fraud
against the bank", they decided to call it "identity theft", a crime
against the customer.  Which means that the customer loses the money
instead of the bank.

</p><p>
This is one reason I don't do internet banking.  The other reason is
that I would have to run nonfree Javascript code.

It is legitimate and useful to use stings to catch people that have

further and manufacturers imaginary "terrorists" to imprison, in the
absence of real terrorists.

<p>
The US must stop <a href="https://letgrow.org/if-i-let-my-kids-eat-pizza-for-a-week-should-they-be-placed-in-foster-care/">
inviting courts to second-guess minor decisions</a>
 that parents make about how to raise their children.
</p><p>
Sure, there are things parents could do that would be very dangerous
to their children and society. For instance, not vaccinating a child
for various diseases could, with a low but significant probability,
lead to the serious injury or death of that child, and of other
children as well. That decision calls for public attention that most
decisions don't.
</p><p>
For instance, leading your child on a walk through a parking lot,
rather than telling per to wait in the car, occasionally results in
the child's injury or death. On the national scale, the danger is
measurable. At the personal level, it is a minute probability.
Courts should not intervene on questions like this.

<a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#bully">The bully</a>'s threat, intended to force Ukraine to investigate Hunter
Biden, has
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/how-ukraine-sees-the-trump-whistleblower-complaint">made
Ukraine realize that the US is not a reliable ally</a>.  Indeed, the
US government is hardly a reliable actor at all.
</p><p>
I've often seen right-wing interventionists insist that the US keep
supporting a tyrannical client government to show it is a "reliable
ally."  I think, on the contrary, that it is good to show rulers that
they can lose support if they attack the people.  But this case is
totally different.  <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#bully">The bully</a> made the US unreliable, not because
Ukraine had done anything wrong, but only because he demanded what he
was not entitled to.

The reason is the evidence that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/impeachment-calls-grow-amid-revelation-trump-ordered-block-on-ukraine-aid">the conman ordered</a> a cut in aid to Ukraine in order to pressure Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden.

He has given dozens — or is it hundreds? — of reasons to justify
impeaching him and removing him from office.  If we could do that, I would
be entirely in favor.

</p><p>
However, until the Republicans that control the Senate rediscover a
shred of appreciation for their own honor or the national interest, we
have no hope of removing him from office after impeaching him.

</p><p>
That being so, impeachment can at most be a political act.  Whether to
do it is a matter of political strategy.  I have been content to leave
that strategic decision to Pelosi.  If she thinks that now it is a
good strategy, I trust her decision.

I think it was a mistake for the article to start by forecasting the

motorists to

The article focuses on the fact that the charging IDs are not secure
against third parties.  However, I think the fact that the charging
station identifies the motorist is the worst injustice.  We need laws
requiring charging stations to allow anonymous use.  This should
include paying cash or with an anonymous digital system such as GNU
Taler.  Drivers on a plan that covers the cost of charging should be
able to demonstrate digitally that they are members without revealing
their identities.
</p><p>
Some charging stations collect 
<a href="https://www.evgo.com/privacy-policy/">a lot more data than
that</a>.
</p><p>
We need laws to require them to offer anonymous charging, for cash,
without collecting any information except the price charged.

instrument of plutocracy and corruption.

In one sense, the Egyptian people are at fault for having too many

individual Egyptians compose that people and yet at the same time are

Canada's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/justin-trudeau-brownface-canada-pm-apologises-after-image-emerges">prime minister Trudeau apologized</a> for the perceived slight of
using face makeup as part of an Aladdin costume at a costume ball.

</p><p>
Subsequently it appeared that he also appeared in parties wearing
blackface.

</p><p>
Blackface is racist because it is part of a longstanding US practice
of <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2019-jan-apr.html#9_March_2019_(Blackface)">mocking blacks using black face makeup on stage</a>, in conjunction
with denying them legal rights.  I've never heard of any
comparable practice of mocking Arabs.  He certainly wasn't doing that
by dressing as Aladdin, whom we know as the hero, not the villain, of
an old story from the Middle East.  I don't see racism there.

</p><p>
All this is small potatoes compared with his wrongs that have done
great practical harm: <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2019-mar-jun.html#29_April_2019_(Canadian_bribery_prosecution)">silencing ministers to cover up corruption</a> and advancing global disaster by pushing the export of <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2019-jul-oct.html#28_July_2019_(Transmountain_tar_sands_pipeline)">tar sands oil</a>.

</p><p>
One important point of dissimilarity between the present is that, in
1914, none of the European powers had a way to mobilize only part of
the army.  Mobilization was a complex plan, and the only plan was for
complete mobilization.  This meant that a country which feared attack
had to mobilize completely, which meant its other enemies had to do
likewise.
</p><p>
If a country which had feared an immediate attack had had the ability
to mobilize partially, that might have deterred its enemies while not
threatening them.
</p><p>
There is no such problem today, with mobilizing reserves.
But I don't know whether that makes a big difference.

Yemen gives Iran a way to do this without starting a new war.
</p><p>
This reminds me of the sanctions the US placed on Japan in 1941.  The
sanctions, in that case, were intended to make Japan stop conquering
China — a morally valid reason.
</p><p>
Japan had the choice to fight the US, be defeated by the sanctions, or
leave China alone.  It chose war, and was defeated anyway.  The cost
of that war was tremendous.
</p><p>
The US has no valid reason for sanctions against Iran.  The valid
goal, avoiding a nuclear-armed Iran, was being achieved by Obama's
non-nuclear deal.

<p>
Republicans "won" the 9th Congressional District of North Carolina by
cheating — they 
<a href="https://www.gregpalast.com/jim-crow-steals-n-carolina-9th-cd/">removed
over 100,000 mostly-Democratic voters from the voting list</a> based
on vague suspicions they might have voted in another state as well.
</p><p>
The margin of the supposed Republican victory was only 4,000.
It is almost certain that the "victory" was due to cheating.
</p><p>
It is not illegal, or even suspect, to be registered to vote in two
states.  That is what normally happens when you move to another state
and register there.  Voters are not asked to tell the previous city,
"I have moved away", the requirement is not to vote there.
</p><p>
However, many of the voters who were removed were not really
registered in another state.  The other registration had a name that
was similar but different.  Republicans do not fall into voter
suppression by accident.  These schemes are carefully planned,
and

<p>
The bullshitter said he was about to have a secret meeting in the US
with Taliban negotiators, and 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/08/trump-taliban-afghanistan-republicans-democrats-reaction">cancelled
it because they carried out a bomb attack in Afghanistan</a>.  (No
cease-fire had been agreed.)
</p><p>
Lots of politicians criticized him for this, al everyone assuming he
was telling the truth about what he had done.  I wouldn't believe, on
his say-so, that he had cancelled a meeting, or that there ever was a
plan for a meeting.
</p><p>
Then the Taliban 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/09/taliban-trump-afghanistan-us-talks-election-violence">affirmed
that the bullshitter cancelled a meeting with them</a>.  Amazing
— he told the truth about this!
</p><p>
I don't agree with the critics that there is anything wrong in
inviting Taliban negotiators to meet with US representatives, whether
in the US, or anywhere else.  I am surprised though that they trusted
him enough to say they would come.
</p><p>
The bullshitter's approach to diplomacy is to posture as tough by
canceling meetings on whatever excuse comes to hand.  I don't see
anything inherently wrong with that maneuver, but I doubt it pressures
other countries' negotiators as he thinks it does.  I expect they see
through it.
</p><p>
That being so, if it creates a problem in negotiations, at least it
won't be permanent.

Media Lab Director Joi Ito confessed that he had secretly <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49623084?intlink_from_url=&amp;link_location=live-reporting-story">accepted donations from Epstein</a> after MIT had decided not to do so.

</p><p>
He also accepted funds for some personal activities of his own.

</p><p>
That dishonesty, and conflict of interest, make his resignation
obligatory.

</p><p>
But I fear for the effect on the Media Lab.  Under Negroponte, the
lab was notoriously stingy and proprietary.  Ito corrected that.
I fear that the next director will undo some of Ito's changes.

Drug prohibition has had a racist tinge since 1857.
Its repression still falls mostly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/07/from-persecution-to-legalisation-what-is-the-ethical-way-to-end-the-war-on-drugs">on the poor and disprivileged</a>.

</p><p>
I cheer consumers that are willing to pay 25% more for fair trade
cocaine, but I think it will be unnecessary — a decrease in
repression would cut the price by far more than that.  Legalizing
sales only through a regulated market might open the door for fair
trade initiatives, as well as make drugs' strength and composition
predictable (thus avoiding most of the deaths) and discouraging some
new users.

</p><p>
If we cut down on beef production, we could eliminate a substantial fraction
of the world's agriculture, and maybe have enough phosphate for a century.

</p><p>
It would be nice if there were a way to finesse this, but I think that
is impossible.  The companies won't accept a compromise in which their

Now Germans are turning that around by calling two newborn pandas

To maintain its monopoly on pandas, China only leases them, never
selling them, and the lease says that all offspring belong to China.
But this is no reason for Germans to call the pandas by the names that
China says are "official".

One small but significant way to push back on China is by not making
any particular fuss about pandas.

This article goes too far in treating the Amazon forest solely as the

authority.  If they decided to sell their land, or accept royalties
from farmers, that would not make it acceptable to cut the forest
down.  The reasons not to allow this are global.
</p><p>
Calling it "the lungs of the Earth" is basically correct (even though
a little exaggerated, since the rest of the Earth's forest share in
the role).  The extinction of perhaps half a million species (counting
microbes) that live only there would be a disaster even if the forest
had no human inhabitants.  The <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#global%20heating">global heating</a> effects would also be

<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/05/ilhan-omar-send-her-back-somalia-us-foreign-policy">doesn't recognize the role that al-Shabaab plays in life in Somalia.
</a>
</p><p>
The article omits to mention that the US is responsible for the very
existence of al-Shabaab. The Islamic courts movement had taken
control of Somalia had established peace. Peace with incomplete
respect for human rights, to be sure — Islamists oppose some aspects
of human rights — but peace with incomplete human rights was a big
step up from faction war with incomplete human rights.
</p><p>
Then Ethiopia intervened, clearly as a US proxy, to destroy the
Islamic courts government. One part of it, no longer in power, was
al-Shabaab.

I can think of two ways parents can work together to resist this swindle:
</p><ul>
<li>
Make unauthorized copies of the school's logo and sew it onto cheap
  generic uniforms.
</li>
<li>
Organize a "uniform strike".  If enough parents together refuse to buy the expensive uniforms, they can make the school back down.
</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, they can teach their children how to respond with defiance
if anyone in the school sneers at them for not having the fancy
expensive school-specific uniform: "My parents are right to prioritize
things that we really need.  If you want to blame someone, blame the
Tories for allowing schools to demand expensive uniforms which are a
burden on students' families.  And for making so many Britons poor."

The right number 1 in this article, "to freely decide you want to use
a given neurotechnology or to refuse it," is obviously insufficient.
You have the right to decide whether an insurance company can track
your car's movements with a GPS box, but many people can't afford the
extra cost of insurance without tracking.  You have the right to work
without a LinkedIn account, but many jobs will pass you by if you

<p>
In "me-too" frenzy, crossed signals about sex can easily be <a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/23/im-radioactive/">inflated
into "rape".</a> If people rush to judgment, in an informal way, that can
destroy a man's career without any trial in which to clear his name.

<p>
The racist bias that presents itself as opposition to "cultural
appropriation" is in danger of being extended to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/23/jewface-row-west-end-musical-falsettos-decried-for-cultural-appropriation">roles that are Jews.
</a>
</p><p>
I can understand the argument that actors from visually distinctive
ethnic groups should be chosen for roles of those groups because they
tend to be excluded from other roles. But now that so many old plays
are being redone with women in male roles, why couldn't we have
non-Caucasian actors in Caucasian roles too?
</p><p>
That issue does not apply to Jews, because Jews have not, in general,
been excluded from roles that are not defined as Jewish. Nobody
suggested that Zero Mostel should not play Pseudolus on the grounds
that that character was a Roman.
</p><p>
That sort of nonsense might happen in the future if the idea that
Jewish parts go with Jewish actors catches on.

development,</a> in conjunction with a university in Jamaica, as reparations
for donated money obtained from slavery.
</p><p>
I support reparations for slavery (and, in the US, for the
century-long subsequent legal discrimination against blacks). The
reparations should be designed to correct the self-perpetuating damage
that is now inflicted on the descendants of those who were legally
discriminated against
</p><p>
I don't know what would be effective at making a long-term change, but
I think it needs to be done at the level of society, not just by
universities.

A 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/22/the-government-of-no-one-by-ruth-kinna-review-anarchism">review
of anarchism</a>.
</p><p>
A hundred years ago, there were anarchist societies on Earth, places
where there was no state, no government.  But that did not in all
cases mean that everyone was equal.  In some peoples in Melanesia, the
men who were most politically adroit gained a kind of political power
by drawing other men into client relationships with them.  Those who
had many clients were called "big men", and sometimes they would lead
their clients to fight the clients of other big men.
</p><p>
The fighting continued until European colonial states made them stop.
"Big men" continued to exist, but they were limited to peaceful means
in their competition for power.
</p><p>
I feel an attraction to anarchy, but I do not endorse anarchism
because there are 
<a href="https://stallman.org/articles/why-we-need-a-state.html">many jobs we need the
state to do</a>.

A message of hope: Australians could yet succeed in 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/22/six-sentences-of-hope-defining-a-unifying-vision-in-the-face-of-the-climate-crisis">stopping
their government from wiping out Tuvalu and then Australia</a>.
</p><p>
If peaceful means do not succeed in preventing the murder of billions,
violent means will be justified.  Given that Australia's present
course of action will predictably kill tens of millions of people
(that would be Australia's share of the billions), destroying
Australia's fossil fuel facilities should be legally justified under
the principle of necessity (to prevent a worse crime).
</p><p>
Since the operation of Australia's fossil fuel facilities and shipping
will contribute to making many lands uninhabitable, including Tuvalu,
they are in effect weapons of mass destruction.  Perhaps Tuvalu should
declare war on Australia and send commandos to destroy those
facilities and sink the coal ships.

I suppose Danes feel relieved rather than punished.
</p><p>
This is not the first time the US demanded to buy another country's
territory.  In 1845 the US asked to buy a part of Mexico.  When Mexico
refused, the US Army fought its way to Mexico City and occupied it
until Mexico's government agreed to the sale.  Henry David Thoreau
famously went to jail rather than pay tax for that war of aggression.

The treaty promised that Mexicans in the transferred territory could

Those people dreamed of making a bomb, but would never have been in a

they were not really capable of hurting anyone.  In addition,
sometimes those "informants" persuaded people who were reluctant to

We did not know in 2001 how the war in Afghanistan would turn out.

Notice the words "it is said" which the article used to cast doubt
on the practical reasons to put the telescope there, while saying nothing
about what they are.
</p><p>
Some obvious reasons why Mauna Kea is an unusually good place to put
the world's biggest telescope: Mauna Kea is high (better seeing
conditions); the air is clean (better seeing conditions); there is
very little light pollution (fainter objects are visible); it is
fairly close to the equator (can view nearly all the sky); there is
already a good road down to facilities not far away (makes construction
cheaper).
</p><p>
Blocking the telescope would do no actual good for Hawaiians and would
be a loss for all humanity.

There was a protest in favor of democracy in Hong Kong in Melbourne,
Australia.  State-managed Chinese social media stirred up a lot of
young Chinese expats to rally against them.

tussle developed</a>.
</p><p>
The article does not say, but I expect that the supporters of China
started the tussle.  Propaganda has taught them that the cause of
China's power is sacred and that anyone who questions it is evil.
</p><p>
Many Chinese students go to Australia, and China has a history of
using them
for <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2019-may-aug.html#6_August_2019_(China_surveils_students_abroad)">political
intimidation</a> in Australia.
It is important to develop systematic ways to expose students from
China to other values while they are in Australia.
</p><p>
One idea that occurs to me is to have a kiosk which can tell people
whether their mobile phones, which they have "switched off", are
really off.  It would be interesting to tell students from China
whether China is snooping on the conversations around them.  It would
be interesting for everyone else that carries a Stalin's Dream device,
too.

niboR campaign and focuses 100% on promoting class injustice. But
it's impossible nowadays to package lots of Republican plutocratists
without finding crumbs of white supremacism mixed in.

Nothing teaches managers to avoid work accidents like making the
company pay for them. That's what worker's compensation is for. But
the piecework sweatshop economy makes the workers "independent
contractors", so they don't get workers' compensation. Change that,
and the companies may learn to truly value the workers' health.

<p>
Americans who oppose racism are going nuts, and treating racial slurs
as unutterable taboos, rather than the insults that they are. Even to
quote a use of the taboo word, regardless of why, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/15/white-professor-investigated-quoting-james-baldwin-use-of-n-word-laurie-sheck">unleashes

for calling attention to that.

I urge people to familiarize themselves with the difference between
using a word and mentioning it. I don't <em>use</em> racial slurs, because I
don't want to insult people, but it is impossible to discuss racism
clearly without <em>mentioning</em> (talking about) those slurs.

When I posted
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2019-jan-apr.html#5_April_2019_(Gun_control)">that assault weapons should be banned because they fire

more grievous and more likely to be fatal, I misinterpreted the
article I was referring to.  This was pointed out to me by a reader.
</p><p>
The comparison actually described by the surgeon was between
high-powered rifles and handguns.  The point is that all high-powered
rifles produce wounds that are more harmful and more likely to kill,
than the wounds made by handguns.  This means I need to change the
conclusions I drew.

My revised conclusion is that we should require high-powered rifles
owned by the public to be designed to hold a small number of rounds,
contained in a fixed part of the rifle rather than in a magazine that
can be quickly replaced.

<p>
Japan conscripted 240,000 Koreans during World War II.  (Japan was
able to do this since it had conquered Korea in 1910.)  After the
war, South Korea called them traitors.  
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/15/i-dont-have-much-hope-koreans-search-for-loved-ones-who-died-fighting-for-japan">Their
families have little information about what happened to them</a>.
</p><p>
The people in those families were wronged twice, and I am sorry for
them.  But sorry also that they put so much importance on scraps of
information that wouldn't change anything about those wrongs.
</p><p>
No good can come from obsessing about the corpse of someone who died
in 1943.  Every Korean, and every Japanese, is familiar with the basic
ideas of Buddhism.  This attachment causes suffering, and only
suffering.
</p><p>
It would be so much wiser to redirect the feeling of loss into efforts
to avoid future wars, future conscription, and future suffering.

<li>
Big Pharma loves NAFTA 2.0 because it guarantees them monopoly powers
to delay generic competition and lock in high drug prices.</li>
<li>
Big oil is lobbying for the deal because it lets them attack Mexican
climate and environmental policies.</li>
<li>
Corporations that have used NAFTA to outsource hundreds of thousands
of jobs to Mexico to pay workers pennies on the dollar are thrilled
the revised deal's labor and environmental terms are too weak to stop
more job outsourcing.</li>
<li>
US agribusiness has used NAFTA to ruin Mexican peasants.  They can't
produce as cheaply as machines in US factory farms, but Mexico had
enough food.</li>

<p>
The US pharma system was designed so that the public pays for the
research, and the profits <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/149438/big-pharma-captured-one-percent">go to rich owners.</a> It was set up this way by a scheme advised by right-wing

</p><p>
More recently, private equity companies have taken over many pharma companies
and drive the gouging.
</p><p>
Pharma is one of the areas where patents do <a href="https://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/students/publications/llj/pdfs/45_1_stallman.pdf">special harm.</a>

It is unfortunate that the article occasionally says "IP" when it
means patents. This encourages the confusion that the

</p><p>
The article suggests using compulsory licenses to knock down these
patents when they endanger the public. I'm entirely in favor of that,
but I think we need to cure the disease, not just treat the symptoms.
</p><p>
The cure I recommend is to take the testing of drugs out of the hands
of drug manufacturers, thus eliminating their argument for artificial
monopolies, and turn them into generic manufacturers.

illness, lack of sleep). If so, it is possible to lead the driver to
a place to pull over and rest.

</p><p>
Here's substantiation for what it says about his <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-used-to-keep-a-book-of-hitlers-speeches-by-his-bed-according-to-his-ex-wife-a6765391.html">having a copy of Hitler's speeches</a>.

It is strange to include rejection of <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#business-supremacy">business-supremacy treaties</a>, or
even outright protectionism, in a list of similarities to Hitler's
methods. Protectionism was standard practice in the 1930s, while

</p><p>
But the overall point is valid even without those. The agreements
Hitler tore up included arms limitation treaties, and the
bullshitter is doing the same.

Cars nowadays send lots of data to the manufacturer through a cellular

</p><p>
The cellular data connection enables the phone network to track the
car's movements, but it wouldn't surprise me if the data includes GPS
location.  (Does anyone know for a fact?)
</p><p>
The right thing to require is that the car offer a data-only
interface, such as a slot to put a memory chip into and the car will
write the data on it.  This way you could show that data to an
independent repair shop when you want to, even though you disconnected
the cellular data antenna and the GPS antenna just after you bought
the car.

The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/10/zimbabwe-emmerson-mnangagwa-battle-to-survive">economy of Zimbabwe is collapsing</a>. It seems to be partly the fault
of local corruption, and partly the fault of IMF-imposed policies to let
the poor starve.
</p><p>
The author thinks that allowing foreigners to own local businesses is
a change for the better; but that is a neoliberal policy which is
meant to enable foreigners to drain the country's money (instead of
the local elite which does so now). I would guess that was imposed by
the IMF. Does anyone know?
</p><p>
In the long run, if poor people keep increasing the population, they
are driving themselves into ever-deeper poverty.

Epstein was accused of trafficking: bringing people long distances on
false pretenses and then pressured them into sex or prostitution. He
also reportedly raped some of those people. I believe those
accusations, and I think he deserved to be imprisoned.
</p><p>
Some of his victims were legally adult. Some were teenage minors. I
don't think that makes any moral difference. I don't think rape is
less wrong if the victim is over 16.

(part of Palestine). Israelis presume it was done by a Palestinian.
</p><p> 
Suppose that was so. If the killing was done for a personal motive,
then it was murder. If it was done as an act of resistance to
occupation, it was war. In neither case does it qualify as
"terrorism", because terrorism means making war on civilians.
</p><p>
If Palestinians attack Israeli noncombattant civilians, that is
terrorism. If Israelis attack Palestinian noncombattant civilians,
that too is terrorism.

bankruptcy and is cheating required workers</a>.
</p><p>
I am in favor of smoothing the transition to renewable energy.
</p><p>
However, survival of civilization requires cutting off coal mining,
and soon. Whatever suffering this causes to the discharged workers,
that will be much less than the suffering continued extraction would cause.
</p><p>
The sooner we do it, the more resources will be available to help the
ex-miners.
</p><p>
We could give all the ex-miners what they deserve, if we can tax the
rich. But we have to stop the mining whether we can tax the rich or
not. At the point of desperation, it is better to save some than save
none.

</p><p>
We know this is true.  It is important that prominent people say it.
</p><p>
Republicans are trying to evade responsibility by saying that the
killers must be mentally disturbed.  Perhaps they are.  However, when
people are predisposed to follow some hate campaign or other and
commit violence for it, they look for a hate movement that is
powerful.  Politicians that support certain hate movements help draw
killers to support them.

The US had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/04/mass-shootings-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio">three mass shootings in one weekend</a>.
</p><p>
Only a small fraction of US gun killings are part of mass shootings,
but mass shootings seem to inspire more mass shootings, and they are
often acts of terrorism inspired by hate movements.
</p><p>
The first of these two shootings, in Dallas, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/08/05/el-paso-gunmans-fear-migrant-invasion-echoed-donald-trump-fox-news/">was an act of right-wing
terrorism</a> and so <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/08/04/el-paso-dayton-mass-shootings-donald-trump/">was one other</a>.
</p><p>
These are clearly inspired by the bully's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/us/politics/trump-mass-shootings.html">support of racism and violence</a>.
</p><p>
He surely knew this would happen; it isn't the first time, after all.
Therefore it must be intentional. Even people who already agreed with
white supremacism are encouraged to leap into violence by their crowds
of supporters.

He has converted the whole <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/05/trump-analysis-republican-party-mass-shootings">Republican party into supporters of racism

</p><p>
I suspect that a policy of dismissing options that are clearly
inferior and writing down a list of only the options you are really

for many reasons if the choice is important.
</p><p>
And stay away from flight connections that are just 60 minutes,
because that makes a significant risk of a missed connection. I would
choose option B for those flights, by intentional policy, regardless
of C. If I had seen only option A, I would have asked my travel

We won't have such treatments soon. You wouldn't want to give an

don't know how to verify that except by trying it. With gigantic

<p>
Al-Qa'ida is still operating, but instead of trying to draw attention
using shocking attacks on the West, its method is
to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/04/no-longer-does-al-qaida-grab-headlines-that-might-be-plan">build
support</a> in various parts of the world.
</p><p>
Since this is not a direct threat to the West, perhaps the West has no
reason to fight it.  However, any region that al-Qa'ida comes to
dominate will suffer a great loss of human rights.  The US should not
intervene militarily, since that would only create an Afghanistan-like
situation.  But if local people want to fight back, it would be good to
give them support while leaving the effort mainly in their hands.

<p>
A father plans
to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/04/separation-conjoined-twins-dilemma">let
his two conjoined daughters die</a> rather than approve an operation
that would probably save one of them.
</p><p>
This is a real-life variant
of <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/trolley-problem.html">the
trolley problem</a>,
with a crucial difference: in this case there was time to study the
issue carefully and establish with near certainty what each choice
would lead to before making the decision.  He cannot rationally deny
that his choice of "do nothing" means death for both of daughters.
</p><p>
His choice is a form of moral cowardice.  The kind of cowardice that
makes someone lose a tooth rather than get a filling.  The kind of
cowardice that makes someone die of late-stage cancer rather than get
early treatment and survive.  So even though I empathize with his
distress at the need to choose between horrible and doubly horrible, I
can't excuse his decision.  The daughters deserve life.  If you can't
save both, at least save one.
</p><p>
I don't think that we should be more concerned about the couple
because they have four other children.  Having so many is a bad thing
to do, but it has no effect on the issue of saving these daughters.

the examples quoted is condemnation of Israel rather than
anti-semitism as such.  I agree, however, that these examples were
unjustified exaggeration.  Her attempts to convince Israel to loosen
some of the restrictions of the occupation is not support for the
occupation.

It is one thing to say that a small step is not a full solution to a
problem.  It is another to say that the small step is bad.  We should
make sure campaigns for small steps don't distract us from advocating
a full solution, but that doesn't require condemning them.

them to take advantage of being in the US to read extensively the

recommended the book, Life and Death in Shanghai, by Nien Cheng, which
describes surviving the cultural revolution of the 60s and 70s.

I largely agree.  I think that the worst aspect of today's advertising
(and the reason there is so much of it) is the collection of personal

advertising corrupts society which don't depend on knowing anything
about who sees the ads — for instance, paid-for articles (I
won't use the euphemism "sponsored" or the derogatory term "content"
for this) and individuals who are paid to insert advertising into
their lives as "influencers".

<p>
Al Franken now
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/29/the-case-of-al-franken">regrets
resigning from the Senate</a>.  Some senators that pushed him to
resign
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/22/al-franken-resignation-senators-regret">now
regret that too</a>.
</p><p>
The first (main) article does not state clearly whether Franken
touched Tweeden in the process of making the photo, but it seems he
did not.  If that is correct, it was not a sexual act at all.  It was
self-mocking humor.  The photograph depicted a fictional sexual act
without her fictional consent, but making the photo wasn't a sexual
act.
</p><p>
If it is true that he persistently pressured her to kiss him, on stage
and off, if he stuck his tongue into her mouth despite her objections,
that could well be sexual harassment.  He should have accepted no for
an answer the first time she said it.  However, calling a kiss "sexual
assault" is an exaggeration, an attempt to equate it to much graver
acts, that are crimes.
</p><p>
The term
<a href="https://stallman.org/antiglossary.html#assult">"sexual
assault"</a> encourages that injustice, and I believe it has been
popularized specifically with that intention.  That is why I reject
that term.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Franken says he did not do those things, and the other
actors he previously did the same USO skit with said it was not
harassment, just acting.  Tweeden's store is clearly false in many
details.
</p><p>
Should we assume Tweeden was honest?  With so many demonstrated
falsehoods in her accusations, and given that she planned them with
other right-wing activists, and that all of them follow a leader who
lies as a tactic every day, I have to suspect that she decided to
falsify accusations through exaggeration so as to kick a strong
Democrat out of the Senate.
</p><p>
I have no proof of that suspicion.  It is possible that she made the
accusations honestly.  Also, in a hypothetical world, someone might
really have done them.  Supposing for the moment that those
accusations were true, should Franken have resigned over them?
</p><p>
I don't think so.  They are misjudgments, not crimes.  Franken
deserved the chance to learn from the criticism that surprised him.
Zero tolerance is a very bad way to judge people.
</p><p>
However, the most important point is to reject the position that if B
feels hurt by what A said or did, then automatically A is wrong.
People judged Franken that way, and he judged himself that way.  But
that way degrades the concept of "wrong" into a mere expression of
subjective disapproval.  What can legitimately be asserted
subjectively can legitimately be ignored subjectively too.  To judge A
that way is to set B up as a tyrant.
</p><p>
If B's feelings were hurt, that's unfortunate -- but is that A's
fault?  If so, was it culpable, or just a mistake?  That is what we
have to judge, and if we want others to think our judgments worth
following, they must be based on objective facts and objective
standards, including objective standards for what words and gestures
objectively mean.
</p><p>
Traister is wrestling with a solvable problem.  She says, "When you
change rules, you end up penalizing people who were caught behaving
according to the old rules."  Maybe people do, but that is a sign of
carelessness.  It isn't really hard to change the rules and then judge
old actions by the old rules.  We just have to remember to do so.

This particular work has a peak season in September.  In a government
office, the staff would focus on this during the peak season, then
most would shift to other tasks for the rest or the year.  A private
business may not have an opportunity to do that.  Its staff is less
stable than civil servants, and its other contracts come and go.

Let's look at the argument that Hong Kongers should surrender their
rights to assuage the hurt feelings of a billion Chinese. Are their feelings really hurt? That could be a fiction fabricated by Chinese state.
</p><p>
But let's suppose that 30 million really do have hurt feelings. It
could be so. If so, why are their feelings hurt? Why do they even
pay attention to Hong Kong? It's because they are more or less
Xi-ple; the state media tells them to feel hurt, and they do not doubt
what they are told.
</p><p>
Any number of people who demand your surrender because they herded to do so
amount to no reason for you to do that.

Why are companies rushing to replace human workers with robots based
on machine learning?  Because that is a way
to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/30/robots-definitely-coming-make-world-more-unequal-place">make
the rich richer</a>, and the poor poorer as a byproduct.
</p><p>
Additional robots are greatly reducing the number of jobs in
manufacturing, and are likely
to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/30/changing-fast-benefits-dangers-robots-uk-workplace">continue doing so</a>.
</p><p>
The fact that one particular factory in the UK has more staff now than
in 2007 is neither here nor there.  Evidently a bigger fraction of the
country's manufacturing has been concentrated there.
</p><p>
The increase in productivity is a benefit to whoever owns the factory,
and the small fraction of people employed there.  But it is not good
for society overall unless those benefits are shared with society
overall.
</p><p>
It is a mistake to see the issue in nationalistic terms as a
competition with other countries.  It does no good to country C to
have robot factories there rather than in D, E and F, if the benefits
go in each case only to the few owners.  What matters to country C is
making sure the people there who don't own plenty of stock in robot
factories can nonetheless enjoy the products of these factories, and
everything else one needs for a good life.

protect them from the power of the rich.

Back when capitalists needed lots of factory workers, that gave the
workers one advantage in their fight for democracy.  But it did not
guarantee victory.  And now that advantage is gone.

Bravo for the article, but one quotation falls into a widespread
confusion: that spread by the term "intellectual property".
</p><blockquote>
and "If you hire a managed service provider to do your network security
they could, instead,... steal your intellectual property."
</blockquote>
<p>
In general, that statement is false. It could not steal your
copyrights, or your patents, or your trademarks, or your plant variety
monopolies, or your IC mask monopolies, or your publicity rights —
those are legal privileges, so they can't be "stolen". I think the
only things it could possibly steal that way are trade secrets.
</p><p>
Please <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html">don't ever
say "intellectual property"</a> if what you mean is "trade secrets" or
if what you mean is "copyrights", or if what you mean is any
other specific thing, because that is a big generalization. It is
likely to convert a narrow true statement into a broad false one.
</p><p>
If you think that what you mean is all of them, then please study the
issue more carefully — a statement so general is usually false,
and probably most of them are not even relevant to the issue at hand.
</p><p>
If you want to quote a statement where someone else used the term
"intellectual property", please check whether the statement was false
due to this confusion. Any statement that used that term probably
was confused.

<p>
Norway focused its prison system on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-48885846">rehabilitation</a>, and recidivism
declined from 60-70% to 20-25%.
</p><p>
Rehabilitation costs more per prisoner but results in having much
fewer prisons.
</p><p>
I suspect that lowering recidivism that much depends on having a
society that offers ex-cons a way to get by, other than through crime.
My impression is that in the US it is so hard to get a job with an
income you can live on, if you have a criminal record, that many
ex-cons that want to go straight are unable to make a go of it. If
the goal is to reduce the harm done by crime, this is self-defeating.
</p><p>
But then, the US also puts a terrible burden on poor people, and on
various disprivileged demographics, even if they don't have a criminal
record. It is a general pattern of dehumanization, rather than a
constructive attempt to address a problem.

<p>
For years I've recommended that the way to defeat extortion through
nude photos is by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/07/the-key-to-avoiding-sexual-shame-online-reveal-it-all-first">posting the nude photos</a>. Now the idea is catching
on.
</p><p>
If defeating extortion nudes (and revenge porn, which differs by its
motive) were the only benefit, perhaps it would not be crucial.
However, it will also help decrease the general nudity taboo, and that
is very important.
</p><p>
Please don't refer to the people who carry out extortion via nudes as
&amp;mdath;hackers—. There is no reason to think that they are hackers; in any
case, routine extortion is not <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html">hacking</a>.

A Starbucks worker asked a few <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> (who were there as customers) to
move because someone <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/07/starbucks-apologises-police-tempe-arizona">felt threatened by them</a>. Starbucks apologized.
</p><p>
If the representative of the <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thug</a> association really can't imagine why
some customers felt threatened, he is mentally deficient, but I think
it more likely he is covering up that side of the truth. I know, from
reading the news and talking with acquaintances, why blacks may feel
endangered by the presence of <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a>. Other people, with less grounds,
may feel endangered by the presence of blacks.
</p><p>
A store should not ask customers to leave, or to move, because
"someone feels threatened by you" — not blacks, and not <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#thug">thugs</a> —
because people should not be judged based on how someone else feels
about them.

Increasing industrial agriculture is <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/07/23/world-hunger-rise">not the way to feed more poor people</a>.

Growing corn or soybeans to make fuel is especially foolish since it
uses petroleum-based fertilizer. When that's subsidized, it is a
handout for agribusiness. Biofuel is efficient only when it's made
from byproducts of growing something else that's worth growing in its
own right.

This is interesting because it demonstrates how extremist hatred has

Constitution with Communism.  That just goes to show what Bush really
thought about the Constitution he swore to uphold.

One additional source of complication is when you can't choose each

I think it is wrong to aggressively promote sales of any medical
treatment.  We must establish that corporations are not entitled to
human rights, so that they can't claim they have a "human right" to
publicize medicines.  But the issue goes beyond advertising.  We must
require drug companies to include "serving patients" alongside "making
money" as their responsibilities, and require participation of patient
representatives in business decisions about medicines.

him in the airport indefinitely until he let them search through his

In my personal experience, the border guards that give me the most
hassle are those of Canada.  A Canadian border agent, which appeared
human but was apparently a robot, demanded I say what I would do when
I returned to the US, while threatening to send me to the US (but not
the US city I was connecting for).
</p><p>
Once in the 90s a couple of US customs agents decided to harass me by
searching my luggage, slowly.  As I was not in a hurry and had only
permitted goods to import, I responded by taking a friendly tone and
complying with utmost diligence and care, which required me to go even
more slowly than they did.  Eventually they realized that their
harassment tactic had backfired, so they finished the search quickly.

Jewish Human Rights Scholar: Yes, America
Has <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/06/21/1-they-came-for-the-mexicans.html">Built
Concentration Camps</a>.
And it is not surprising that some of the prisoners in them have
died as a result of the systematic mistreatment.
</p><p>
The term "concentration camp" was initially used as a euphemism for
prisons into which colonial powers (Spain, the US, and Germany) and
conquerors (including the UK) forced a civilian population which was
sheltering and aiding rebels.  Killing them was not the specific
intention, but in many of these camps the general mistreatment and
lack of medical care killed substantial numbers of the prisoners.
This
is <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/06/21/migrant-children-imprisoned-texas-detail-border-patrols-level-inhumanity">what
the US is doing now</a> to unauthorized immigrants.
</p><p>
The Nazis built political prisons which were referred to as
"concentration camps".  Initially they did not murder prisoners
outright but systematically worked prisoners to death.  Later the
Nazis began directly murdering large numbers of Jews (and others) in
some of these camps.  Thus, the term became associated with outright
mass murder.
</p><p>
The writer of that article believes that massive imprisonment is the
penultimate step on the road to genocide.  This may be right, because
the conditions that lead to setting up such camps generate hatred.

Blue Cross / Blue Shield offers subscribers a list of psychiatrists

</p><p>
Many other insurance plans are equally bad, and it affects other
medical specialties, not just psychiatrists.

intentionally to discourage patients from getting care, and thus
reduce what they have to pay for.

Several years ago I reported on how Israel used the same propaganda

Israel described Israeli
bombing <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2012-sep-dec.html#15_November_2012_(Israeli_group_near_Gaza_calls_for_negotiations)">as
"retaliation"</a> and Hamas missiles as "aggression".  At that time,

justified.  But then there should be negotiations for a cease fire in

The "young adult" book category is consuming itself with censorship
demands.  Many books have
been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/15/torn-apart-the-vicious-war-over-young-adult-books">withdrawn
or cancelled</a> in response to pressure campaigns accusing the
authors of various sorts of "insensitivity" or "cultural
appropriation".
</p><p>
The critics demand authors portray every minority in a "sensitive"
way.  Is there anyone in the world that can do this?  Any given human
being belongs only to a few groups.  An author will have to play safe
by assigning every character to the groups <a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#perse">perse</a> belongs to.  But this
would trigger condemnation for a lack of diversity.
</p><p>
It looks like young adult books will have to be written by committees
that can provide sensitive treatment of many different intersections
of minority groups.  The publisher would apply for a sensitivity
certification from the Sensitivity Authority, which might demand
changes.  Then it would direct readers to send their complaints to the
SA if they think its evaluation standards ought to be changed.
</p><p>
I have decided to oppose <em>all</em> campaigns that demand publishers
withdraw a book, or a contribution to a book — regardless of
what reasons are cited.  Demanding censorship of books is in itself
destructive.  Even if the name presented on the book as author were
"Donald Trump", I would not demand the publisher withdraw it.

Communism was once an international movement.  Then, Communists
professed good, idealistic goals, while some carried out repression
that they hid from the rest.  Communists considered it entirely proper
for the Soviet Union to aid Communist parties all around the world.
</p><p>
Now fascists have made an international movement, with repression as
the overt goal.  I have a hunch Salvini's followers will say, "It's
great that you got funds from Putin so we subject Italy to
repression."
