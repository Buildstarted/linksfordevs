    <p>When dealing with third party web apis one often times encounter that the
api you want to use is rate limited, which is a reasonable measure by the service
provider to prevent users from overloading the system. But nevertheless it’s often
times a big inconvenience when you have a lot of requests to make and you will
exceed the rate limit. Most systems work by limiting the amount of requests
in a given timespan.</p>

<p>I am currently developing a <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/">ruby-toolbox</a> clone
for the swift programming language. In order to
get the relevant library information I have to work a lot with the Github API
First of all: the Github API is amazing
you can get most information with just one well crafted graphql query. The
github api is rate-limited so that you are only allowed to make a 1000 requests
per hour, which to be honest is enough for most use cases. Having more than 40k
projects I repeatedly run into exceeding that limit.</p>

<p>So how to deal with that, you could just let the request fail when receiving the
rate limit exceeded status code from Github and let a job system like
<a href="https://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a> let it retry. But sidekiq in it’s default configuration
retries the job repeatedly and isn’t aware of the next Github request limit reset, so the system would basically
just retry a couple of times and give up, and even worse Github would probably call
after a while, asking whether I am aware of those unnecessary requests. Simply put
that’s not a solution.</p>

<p>The solution I came up with instead uses a redis backed system that schedules the
jobs and respects the next api rate limiti reset.</p>

<p>Every GrahpQL query I submit requests the current rate limiting state.
The rate limiting state includes how many requests I have left and when the next rate limit
reset will occure. That’s everything I need to know. This information is stored
after each request in redis, I wrapped this rate limiting state in a handy ruby class
that deals with writing and reading this state from/to redis so that the code
isn’t littered with redis connections. Now that I have the current rate limit state
I need to handle the failure case gracefully. To do this I wrote a small class
that wraps the state and checks whether it is possible to perform the request.
If possible I perform the given block, otherwise I take the
class and the arguments of the worker and perform it
the moment the next reset occurs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>GithubRateLimitedApiState</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>perform_if_possible</span><span>(</span><span>worker_class</span><span>:,</span> <span>args</span><span>:)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>state</span><span>.</span><span>remaining_requests</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>
      <span>yield</span> <span>state</span>
    <span>else</span>
      <span>worker_class</span><span>.</span><span>perform_at</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>next_reset</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>.</span><span>second</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Putting it all together I rewrote the <code>FetchRepoInformationWorker</code> to use this
small method. In the passed block I perform the request and update the
rate limiting state so that the system knows the new state</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>FetchRepoInformationWorker</span>
  <span>include</span> <span>Sidekiq</span><span>::</span><span>Worker</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>perform</span><span>(</span><span>project_url</span><span>)</span>
    <span>GithubRateLimitedApiState</span><span>.</span><span>perform_or_delay</span><span>(</span><span>worker_class: </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>class</span><span>,</span>
                                               <span>args: </span><span>[</span><span>project_url</span><span>])</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>state</span><span>|</span>
       <span>repo_info</span> <span>=</span> <span>GithubGraphqlClient</span><span>.</span><span>repository_information</span><span>(</span><span>project_url</span><span>)</span>

       <span># store information</span>
       <span># ...</span>

       <span># update the new state</span>
       <span>state</span><span>.</span><span>next_reset</span> <span>=</span> <span>repo_info</span><span>.</span><span>rate_limiting_state</span><span>.</span><span>next_reset</span>
       <span>state</span><span>.</span><span>remaining_requests</span> <span>=</span> <span>repo_info</span><span>.</span><span>rate_limiting_state</span><span>.</span><span>remaining_requests</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it works quite well, I put it in production and as of know
Sentry stayed quiet and the system updates the repositories on a regular basis.
It needs to be seen whether there are any error cases like a race condition between
the jobs, but even then the retry system should handle that.</p>

<p>I hope that this blog post gave you some ideas how to handle rate limited apis with
sidekiq and redis.</p>
