If you are studying ASP.NET Core, Dody is often found on this <a href="https://gitter.im/DotNetStudyGroup/aspnetcore">Gitter Channel</a> answering questions and generally being helpful.</p><h3>Over 300 samples for ASP.NET Core 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 and 3.1 fundamentals</h3><p><strong>This is a massive amount of work.

Amazing!</p><p>Here's just a few of the resources on the Practical ASP.NET Repository:</p><p>I know Dody would appreciate the help and this is a great way for you to get involved in open source AND learn a little about ASP.NET.
