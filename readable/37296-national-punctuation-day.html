There were many excellent entries in this year’s contest. The judges had a hard time 
selecting one winner, so they decided to recognize 12 students from schools in 
five states.</p><p>To remind you, contestants were asked, “What punctuation error annoys you the most?” 
They were asked to find an online meme that illustrates the one 
punctuation error that sets them off, that makes them scream, that gets them into 
correction mode. They were asked to e-mail that meme to NPD headquarters 
along with no more than 250 of their most clever, brilliant, dazzling words 
to make their case why this particular punctuation error not only drives 
them nuts, but also has occasionally transformed them into the punctuation police.</p><p>Every year we get a plethora of entries from students in Washington-Liberty High School 
(Arlington, Virginia) teacher David Peters's class. This year was no exception. 
Judges picked the top five from Peters's classroom, with an extra nod to Martha Hays, 
whose treatise on the Oxford Comma was not only clever, but educational. Who knew that 
more than one rhinoceros are rhinoceri?</p><p>And, kudos to Benjamin Quinones, of Lincoln High School in Shinnston, West Virginia. 
He got off the best line of all entrants, reflecting his concern for the safety of hunters. 
It was subtle, but hit its mark with our judges. See if you can find it.
