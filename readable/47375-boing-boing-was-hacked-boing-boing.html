Once this was confirmed, we removed the offending code immediately from our servers and our CDN partners.</p><p>The BB team then proceeded to change passwords, access tokens, confirm access rights, and perform log analysis of the behavior of the user. As stated in our privacy policy, we only keep 72 hours worth of logs, but this was sufficient to track down the malicious activity and user account in question and react accordingly. We also took steps to modify our CMS to ensure a separate audit log (outside our 72-hour access logs) will be maintained in the future to help us track down administrative actions within our publishing software in the event of future breaches, so we are able to take action and determine the scope of a breach more thoroughly in the future.</p><p>From a systems security perspective, this is an excellent cautionary tale of the importance of individual user security. Even two-factor authentication and password hygiene can be compromised on the user's end, and just because a particular issue (in this case, malware) had been detected via third parties in the past, it always pays to consider all possible first-party infection vectors, as well.</p><p>If you read Boing Boing this past weekend, please run your local anti-virus and malware scanners.</p><p>Thank you. </p></div><div id="next-post-thumbnails"><div class="nextstory"><a href="https://boingboing.net/2020/02/10/us-charges-4-chinese-spies-wit.html?utm_source=moreatbb&amp;utm_medium=nextpost&amp;utm_campaign=nextpostthumbnails" onclick="clickTrack(this.href, 'Next Post Button', 'Next Post Thumbnails');"><img width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/equifax.jpeg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/equifax.jpeg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/equifax.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/equifax.jpeg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a><p>•&nbsp;The Equifax breach was disclosed in 2017, exposed financial records of 150M Americans • FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich: “This is the largest theft of sensitive PII by state-sponsored hackers ever recorded.”</p></div><div class="nextstory"><a href="https://boingboing.net/2020/02/05/disinformation-2020-fbi-warns.html?utm_source=moreatbb&amp;utm_medium=nextpost&amp;utm_campaign=nextpostthumbnails" onclick="clickTrack(this.href, 'Next Post Button', 'Next Post Thumbnails');"><img width="600" height="338" src="https://i1.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wrayy.jpg?fit=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wrayy.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i1.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wrayy.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wrayy.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a><p>“They identify an issue that they know that the American people feel passionately about on both sides and then they take both sides and spin them up so they pit us against each other.
