    <h1>Untitled Goose Game dev will donate 1 percent of income to Indigenous Australians</h1>
    <div class="page_data_1"><p>Australian developer House House has pledged to donate at least 1 percent of its income to the nation&apos;s Indigenous groups as part of the &apos;Pay the Rent&apos; initiative.&#xA0;</p> <p>The studio, which recently launched <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/356224/Untitled_Goose_Game_has_topped_1_million_sales_in_three_months.php">hugely popular puzzler <em>Untitled Goose Game</em>,</a> said its video games are currently being made on stolen Wurundjeri land, and that it intends to acknowledge that fact by handing over a portion of its earnings to the original residents.</p> <p>&quot;We at House House will be paying at least 1 percent of our income to Indigenous groups, in perpetuity, as part of the Pay the Rent movement. We&apos;d encourage others to do the same,&quot; wrote the company on Twitter.&#xA0;</p> <p>&quot;As a start, we&apos;re giving to the Wurundjeri Tribe Council, Warriors of Aboriginal Resistance, and Seedmob. If you&apos;re a settler living and working on Aboriginal land, like we are, please consider paying the rent.&quot;</p> <p>Pay the Rent asks that non-Aboriginal Australians give back some&#xA0;of the wealth they gained from the invasion and appropriation of Indigenous land to help &quot;traditional land owners in their struggle for self-determination and economic independence.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Today Pay the Rent is a reasonable, rational, and responsible way of ensuring the survival of the oldest living culture in the world,&quot; reads an explainer on the <a href="https://www.invasionday.org/pay-the-rent-campaigns">Pay the Rent website</a>. &quot;It is a significant con tribulation to the process of Reconciliation, and embracing its philosophy is a sign of growing maturity among today&apos;s &apos;Australians.&apos;&quot;&#xA0;</p> <p>Considering&#xA0;<em>Untitled Goose Game</em> recently surpassed 1 million sales in just three months, House House&apos;s income pledge could amount to a serious lump of cash if the game continues to sell well.</p></div>
