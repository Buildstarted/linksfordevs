						<p>In short: is <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/IdentityServer4/3.0.0">released</a>&nbsp;(along with the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/IdentityModel.AspNetCore.OAuth2Introspection/4.0.0">introspection</a> and <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/IdentityServer4.AccessTokenValidation/3.0.0">access control validation handler</a>).</p>
<p>As part of the longer version, you might ask yourself how we can do that before ASP.NET Core 3 itself is released. Well â€“ itâ€™s a slightly complicated story.</p>
<p>Since the IdentityServer Nuget packages are referenced in some of the ASP.NET Core 3 templates, we had a bit of a chicken/egg situation, and we worked closely with the ASP.NET Team (thanks Javier!) to make sure we are doing this right.</p>
<p><strong>Our</strong> 3.0 version is referencing ASP.NET Core 3 Preview9 which is fully supported for production and we were promised that there wonâ€™t be any changes that affect us between now and <strong>their</strong> RTM. IOW â€“ ASP.NET Core 3 will ship with a reference to <strong>our</strong> 3.0 â€“ and on the 23rd September, we will release a 3.0.1 which then will in turn reference <strong>their</strong> 3.0â€¦and hopefully all the stars align ;)</p>
<p><em>(For those who know â€“ this concludes a long â€“ and sometimes painful â€“ journey, that started back in 2012)</em></p>
<p>Long story short â€“ our version of IdentityServer4 targeting ASP.NET Core 3 is now on Nuget, and you can give it a try. Next step for us is updating all our docs, samples and workshop materials, which should be done by the 23rd September.</p>
<p><strong>Whatâ€™s new?</strong><br>
Well not a lot really. Our main focus was to ensure compatibility with ASP.NET Core 3, but since we had the opportunity to do a bit of a re-org, we added the last missing pieces that were required for our <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI</a> compliance. Namely support for the <em>PS*</em> family of signing algorithms (along with support for elliptic curves as well) and <em>s_hash</em> support. More details in upcoming blog posts.</p>
<p>As always â€“ feedback is appreciated.</p>
