just <a href="http://internmentcamps.us">click here.</a>)</p><p class="message"><a href="https://www.2600.com">2600 Magazine</a> has compiled a full listing of Customs and Border Patrol
stations, a number of which are being used to imprison migrants,
immigrants, and/or refugees, many of whom are children. In the interests
of openness, we are sharing that info here. Please note that not every
facility in this list is being used for this purpose, but many existing
camps are either at one of these addresses or are being managed there. And the potential for
expansion is ever present. This is also only a partial list of the total
number of camps, as others are operated by different branches of the
government, as well as by private companies. We will be updating it as we receive and compile more data. If you have additional info
to add, please write to <a href="mailto:webmaster@2600.com">webmaster@2600.com</a> or visit our SecureDrop page
