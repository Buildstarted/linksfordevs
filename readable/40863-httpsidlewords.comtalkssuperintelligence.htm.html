Here's how that works:
    
    </p><p>Imagine that you're a historian, living in a post-Singularity world.  You study the Second World War and want to know what would happen if Hitler had captured Moscow in 1941. Since you have access to hypercomputers,  you set up a simulation, watch the armies roll in, and write your paper.
    
    </p><p>But because the simulation is so detailed, the entities in it are conscious beings, just like you. So your university ethics board is not going to let you turn it off. It's bad enough that you've already simulated the Holocaust.  As an ethical researcher, you have to keep this thing running.
    
    </p><p>Eventually that simulated world will invent computers, develop AI, and start running its own simulations.  So in a sense it's simulations all the way down, until you run out of CPU.
    
    </p><p>So you see that every base reality can contain a vast number of nested simulations, and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediocrity_principle">a simple counting argument</a> tells us we're much more likely to live in a simulated world than the real one.
    
    </p><p>But if you believe this, you believe in magic. Because if we're in a simulation, we know <i>nothing</i> about the rules in the level above.  We don't even know if math works the same wayâ€”maybe in the simulating world 2+2=5, or maybe 2+2=ðŸ‘¹. 
    
    </p><p>A simulated world gives us no information about the world it's running in.
    
    </p><p>In a simulation, people could easily rise from the dead, if the sysadmin just kept the right backups. And if we can communicate with one of the admins, then we basically have a hotline to God. 
    
    </p><p>This is a powerful solvent for sanity.  When you start getting deep into simulation world, you begin to go nuts.
    
     
     </p><p>[ Note that we now have four independent ways in which superintelligence offers us immortality:
     </p><ol><li> A benevolent AI invents medical nanotechnology and keeps your body young forever.</li><li>The AI invents full-brain scanning, including brain scans on dead people, frozen heads etc., that let you live in a computer.</li><li>The AI "resurrects" people by scanning other people's brains for memories of the person, and combining that with video and other records.
        If no one remembers the person well enough, they can always be grown  "from scratch" in a simulation designed to start with their DNA and re-create all the circumstances of their life.</li><li>If we already live in a simulation, there's a chance that whoever/whatever runs the simulation is keeping proper backups, and can be persuaded to reload them.</li></ol>   
    This is what I mean by AI appealing to religious impulses. What other belief system offers you four different flavors of scientifically proven immortality?]
    
    

       
    <p>Weâ€™ve learned that at least one American plutocrat (almost certainly Elon Musk, who believes the odds are a billion to one against us living in "base reality") has hired a pair of coders to try to hack the simulation.

</p><p>This is an extraordinarily rude thing to do!  I'm using it!

</p><p>If you think weâ€™re living in a computer program, trying to segfault it is inconsiderate to everyone who lives in it with you. It is far more dangerous and irresponsible than the atomic scientists who risked blowing up the atmosphere.
