										<p>Whether you feel that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/the-witness/" rel="nofollow">The Witness</a> is slightly or enormously pretentious, three things are undeniable: It contains a lot of puzzles, it’s lovely to look at, and it’s the Epic Games Store’s new fortnightly giveaway. Developed by Jonathan Blow’s (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/braid/">Braid</a>) studio Thekla, it’s part <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/myst/">Myst</a>, part jumbo puzzle book. In the game, your sole method of interaction with its lovely landscapes is to draw lines, mostly on strange high-tech signs, featuring unwritten rules that must be wordlessly intuited. You can <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/the-witness/home">grab the game here</a>, and see a trailer and some thoughts below.</p>

<p>There’s been a lot said about it since the game’s release. Mostly positive, like Richard Moss’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/04/the-witness-pc-review/">The Witness review</a>. Alex Wiltshire had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/19/the-witness-tutorial/">some erudite things to say</a> about how the game teaches its systems wordlessly through trial, error and intuition. More recently, Cian Maher had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/09/27/how-the-witness-fooled-us-all-with-a-postmodern-bait-and-switch/">some deep thoughts on the overall message of the game</a>, whether it respects the player’s time and some very spoilery things on the ending, so you should probably just play it first if you’ve not already. Personally, I tapped out after a few hours and watched more puzzle-oriented friends solve things that made my brain bubble.</p>

<p>Still, even if I failed to conquer the mountain of scribbling that is The Witness, I still had an enjoyable time with it. While not signposted or presented as a narrative track to follow, each area’s puzzles slowly escalate in difficulty, quietly introducing rules tied to colours or patterns that are learnt through experimentation. Later on there’s a few grand intuitive leaps to be made. I shan’t spoil much, but reaching any of the game’s multiple endings requires some literal out-of-the-box thinking. The puzzling is good enough to far outshine the self-indulgent fluff that is the game’s audio-log and video-delivered narrative.</p>
<p>The Witness is <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/the-witness/home" rel="nofollow">free on the Epic Store</a> for the next two weeks. Grab it now, keep it forever.</p>
