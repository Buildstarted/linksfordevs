            <p> C<span>HARLES DICKENS</span>, in a note now lying before me, alluding to an examination I once made of
              the mechanism of “Barnaby Rudge,” says — “By the way, are you aware that Godwin wrote his ‘Caleb
              Williams’ backwards? He first involved his hero in a web of difficulties, forming the second volume, and then, for the first, cast
              about him for some mode of accounting for what had been done.” </p>
            <p> I cannot think this the <i>precise</i> mode of procedure on the part of Godwin — and indeed what he himself
              acknowledges, is not altogether in accordance with Mr. Dickens’ idea — but the author of “Caleb Williams” was
              too good an artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from at least a somewhat similar process. Nothing is more clear than that
              every plot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its <i>dénouement</i> before any thing be attempted with the pen. It is only
              with the <i>dénouement</i> constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of consequence, or causation, by
              making the incidents, and especially the tone at all points, tend to the development of the intention. </p>
            <p> There is a radical error, I think, in the usual mode of constructing a story. Either history affords a thesis —
              or one is suggested by an incident of the day — or, at best, the author sets himself to work in the combination of striking events
              to form merely the basis of his narrative — designing, generally, to fill in with description, dialogue, or autorial comment,
              whatever crevices of fact, or action, may, from page to page, render themselves apparent. </p>
            <p> I prefer commencing with the consideration of an <i>effect.</i> Keeping originality <i>always</i> in view — for
              he is false to himself who ventures to dispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of interest — I say to myself,
              in the first place, “Of the innumerable effects, or impressions, of which the heart, the intellect, or (more generally) the soul
              is susceptible, what one shall I, on the present occasion, select?” Having chosen a novel, first, and secondly a vivid effect, I
              consider whether it can best be wrought by incident or tone — whether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone, or the converse, or
              by peculiarity both of incident and tone — afterward looking about me (or rather within) for such combinations of event, or tone,
              as shall best aid me in the construction of the effect. </p>
            <p> I have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written by any author who would — that is to say,
              who could — detail, step by step, the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its ultimate point of completion.
              Why such <b>[column 2:]</b> a paper has never been given to the world, I am much at a loss to say — but, perhaps, the autorial
              vanity has had more to do with the omission than any one other cause. Most writers — poets in especial — prefer having it
              understood that they compose by a species of fine frenzy — an ecstatic intuition — and would positively shudder at letting
              the public take a peep behind the scenes, at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought — at the true purposes seized only
              at the last moment — at the innumerable glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view — at the fully
              matured fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable — at the cautious selections and rejections — at the painful erasures
              and interpolations — in a word, at the wheels and pinions — the tackle for scene-shifting — the step-ladders and
              demon-traps — the cock’s feathers, the red paint and the black patches, which, in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred,
              constitute the properties of the literary <i>histrio.</i>
            </p>
            <p> I am aware, on the other hand, that the case is by no means common, in which an author is at all in condition to
              retrace the steps by which his conclusions have been attained. In general, suggestions, having arisen pell-mell, are pursued and
              forgotten in a similar manner. </p>
            <p> For my own part, I have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to, nor, at any time, the least difficulty in
              recalling to mind the progressive steps of any of my compositions; and, since the interest of an analysis, or reconstruction, such as I
              have considered a <i>desideratum</i>, is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in the thing analyzed, it will not be
              regarded as a breach of decorum on my part to show the <i>modus operandi</i> by which some one of my own works was put together. I
              select “The Raven,” as most generally known. It is my design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is
              referrible either to accident or intuition — that the work proceeded, step by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid
              consequence of a mathematical problem. </p>
            <p> Let us dismiss, as irrelevant to the poem <i>per se,</i> the circumstance — or say the necessity — which,
              in the first place, gave rise to the intention of composing <i>a</i> poem that should suit at once the popular and the critical taste. </p>
            <p> We commence, then, with this intention. </p>
            <p> The initial consideration was that of extent. If any literary work is too long to be read at one sitting, we must be
              content to dispense with the immensely important effect derivable from unity of impression — <a name="pg0164"><span>[page&nbsp;164:]</span></a> for, if two sittings be required, the affairs of the world interfere, and every thing like totality is
              at once destroyed. But since, <i>ceteris paribus,</i> no poet can afford to dispense with <i>any thing</i> that may advance his design,
              it but remains to be seen whether there is, in extent, any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attends it. Here I say
              no, at once. What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely a succession of brief ones — that is to say, of brief poetical effects.
              It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such, only inasmuch as it intensely excites, by elevating, the soul; and all intense
              excitements are, through a psychal necessity, brief. For this reason, at least one half of the “Paradise Lost” is
              essentially prose — a succession of poetical excitements interspersed, <i>inevitably,</i> with corresponding depressions —
              the whole being deprived, through the extremeness of its length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity, of
              effect. </p>
            <p> It appears evident, then, that there is a distinct limit, as regards length, to all works of literary art — the
              limit of a single sitting — and that, although in certain classes of prose composition, such as “Robinson Crusoe,”
              (demanding no unity,) this limit may be advantageously overpassed, it can never properly be overpassed in a poem. Within this limit, the
              extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to its merit — in other words, to the excitement or elevation —
              again in other words, to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is capable of inducing; for it is clear that the brevity must
              be in direct ratio of the intensity of the intended effect: — this, with one proviso — that a certain degree of duration is
              absolutely requisite for the production of any effect at all. </p>
            <p> Holding in view these considerations, as well as that degree of excitement which I deemed not above the popular, while
              not below the critical, taste, I reached at once what I conceived the proper <i>length</i> for my intended poem — a length of
              about one hundred lines. It is, in fact, a hundred and eight. </p>
            <p> My next thought concerned the choice of an impression, or effect, to be conveyed: and here I may as well observe that,
              throughout the construction, I kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work <i>universally</i> appreciable. I should be
              carried too far out of my immediate topic were I to demonstrate a point upon which I have repeatedly insisted, and which, with the
              poetical, stands not in the slightest need of demonstration — the point, I mean, that Beauty is the sole legitimate province of
              the poem. A few words, however, in elucidation of my real meaning, which some of my friends have evinced a disposition to misrepresent.
              That pleasure which is at once the most intense, the most elevating, and the most pure, is, I believe, found in the contemplation of the
              beautiful. When, indeed, men speak of Beauty, they mean, precisely, not a quality, as is supposed, but an effect — they refer, in
              short, just to that intense and pure elevation of <i>soul — not</i> of intellect, or of heart — upon which I have commented,
              and which is experienced in consequence of contemplating “the beautiful.” Now I designate <b>[column 2:]</b> Beauty as the
              province of the poem, merely because it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring from direct causes — that
              objects should be attained through means best adapted for their attainment — no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that
              the peculiar elevation alluded to, is <i>most readily</i> attained in the poem. Now the object, Truth, or the satisfaction of the
              intellect, and the object Passion, or the excitement of the heart, are, although attainable, to a certain extent, in poetry, far more
              readily attainable in prose. Truth, in fact, demands a precision, and Passion, a <i>homeliness</i> (the truly passionate will comprehend
              me) which are absolutely antagonistic to that Beauty which, I maintain, is the excitement, or pleasurable elevation, of the soul. It by
              no means follows from any thing here said, that passion, or even truth, may not be introduced, and even profitably introduced, into a
              poem — for they may serve in elucidation, or aid the general effect, as do discords in music, by contrast — but the true
              artist will always contrive, first, to tone them into proper subservience to the predominant aim, and, secondly, to enveil them, as far
              as possible, in that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence of the poem. </p>
            <p> Regarding, then, Beauty as my province, my next question referred to the <i>tone</i> of its highest manifestation
              — and all experience has shown that this tone is one of <i>sadness.</i> Beauty of whatever kind, in its supreme development,
              invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears. Melancholy is thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones. </p>
            <p> The length, the province, and the tone, being thus determined, I betook myself to ordinary induction, with the view of
              obtaining some artistic piquancy which might serve me as a key-note in the construction of the poem — some pivot upon which the
              whole structure might turn. In carefully thinking over all the usual artistic effects — or more properly <i>points,</i> in the
              theatrical sense — I did not fail to perceive immediately that no one had been so universally employed as that of the
                <i>refrain.</i> The universality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic value, and spared me the necessity of
              submitting it to analysis. I considered it, however, with regard to its susceptibility of improvement, and soon saw it to be in a
              primitive condition. As commonly used, the <i>refrain,</i> or burden, not only is limited to lyric verse, but depends for its impression
              upon the force of monotone — both in sound and thought. The pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identity — of
              repetition. I resolved to diversify, and so vastly heighten, the effect, by adhering, in general, to the monotone of sound, while I
              continually varied that of thought: that is to say, I determined to produce continuously novel effects, by the variation <i>of the
                application</i> of the <i>refrain — </i> the <i>refrain</i> itself remaining, for the most part, unvaried. </p>
            <p> These points being settled, I next bethought me of the <i>nature</i> of my <i>refrain.</i> Since its application was to
              be repeatedly varied, it was clear that the <i>refrain</i> itself must be brief, for there would have been an insurmountable difficulty
              in frequent variations of <a name="pg0165"><span>[page&nbsp;165:]</span></a> application in any sentence of length. In
              proportion to the brevity of the sentence, would, of course, be the facility of the variation. This led me at once to a single word as
              the best <i>refrain.</i>
            </p>
            <p> The question now arose as to the <i>character</i> of the word. Having made up my mind to a <i>refrain,</i> the division
              of the poem into stanzas was, of course, a corollary: the <i>refrain</i> forming the close to each stanza. That such a close, to have
              force, must be sonorous and susceptible of protracted emphasis, admitted no doubt: and these considerations inevitably led me to the
              long <i>o</i> as the most sonorous vowel, in connection with <i>r</i> as the most producible consonant. </p>
            <p> The sound of the <i>refrain</i> being thus determined, it became necessary to select a word embodying this sound, and
              at the same time in the fullest possible keeping with that melancholy which I had predetermined as the tone of the poem. In such a
              search it would have been absolutely impossible to overlook the word “Nevermore.” In fact, it was the very first which
              presented itself. </p>
            <p> The next <i>desideratum</i> was a pretext for the continuous use of the one word “nevermore.” In observing
              the difficulty which I at once found in inventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition, I did not fail to
              perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the pre-assumption that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously spoken by
                <i>a human</i> being — I did not fail to perceive, in short, that the difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with
              the exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word. Here, then, immediately arose the idea of a <i>non</i> -reasoning
              creature capable of speech; and, very naturally, a parrot, in the first instance, suggested itself, but was superseded forthwith by a
              Raven, as equally capable of speech, and infinitely more in keeping with the intended <i>tone</i>. </p>
            <p> I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven — the bird of ill omen — monotonously repeating the one
              word, “Nevermore,” at the conclusion of each stanza, in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length about one hundred lines.
              Now, never losing sight of the object <i>supremeness</i>, or perfection, at all points, I asked myself — “Of all melancholy
              topics, what, according to the <i>universal</i> understanding of mankind, is the <i>most</i> melancholy?” Death — was the
              obvious reply. “And when,” I said, “is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?” From what I have already
              explained at some length, the answer, here also, is obvious — “When it most closely allies itself to <i>Beauty:</i> the
              death, then, of a beautiful woman is, unquestionably, the most poetical topic in the world — and equally is it beyond doubt that
              the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover.” </p>
            <p> I had now to combine the two ideas, of a lover lamenting his deceased mistress and a Raven continuously repeating the
              word “Nevermore” — I had to combine these, bearing in mind my design of varying, at every turn, the <i>application</i>
              of the word repeated; but the only intelligible mode of such combination is that of imagining the Raven employing the word in <b>[column
                2:]</b> answer to the queries of the lover. And here it was that I saw at once the opportunity afforded for the effect on which I had
              been depending — that is to say, the effect of the <i>variation of application</i>. I saw that I could make the first query
              propounded by the lover — the first query to which the Raven should reply “Nevermore” — that I could make this
              first query a commonplace one — the second less so — the third still less, and so on — until at length the lover,
              startled from his original <i>nonchalance</i> by the melancholy character of the word itself — by its frequent repetition —
              and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of the fowl that uttered it — is at length excited to superstition, and wildly
              propounds queries of a far different character — queries whose solution he has passionately at heart — propounds them half
              in superstition and half in that species of despair which delights in self-torture — propounds them not altogether because he
              believes in the prophetic or demoniac character of the bird (which, reason assures him, is merely repeating a lesson learned by rote)
              but because he experiences a phrenzied pleasure in so modeling his questions as to receive from the <i>expected</i>
              “Nevermore” the most delicious because the most intolerable of sorrow. Perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me —
              or, more strictly, thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction — I first established in mind the climax, or concluding
              query — that to which “Nevermore” should be in the last place an answer — that in reply to which this word
              “Nevermore” should involve the utmost conceivable amount of sorrow and despair. </p>
            <p> Here then the poem may be said to have its beginning — at the end, where all works of art should begin —
              for it was here, at this point of my preconsiderations, that I first put pen to paper in the composition of the stanza: </p>
            <div>
              <p>
                <a name="raven">“</a>Prophet,” said I, “thing of evil! prophet still if bird or devil! </p>
              <p> By that heaven that bends above us — by that God we both adore, </p>
              <p> Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within the distant Aidenn, </p>
              <p> It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore — </p>
              <p> Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.” </p>
              <p> Quoth the raven — “Nevermore.” </p>
            </div>
            <p> I composed this stanza, at this point, first that, by establishing the climax, I might the better vary and graduate, as
              regards seriousness and importance, the preceding queries of the lover — and, secondly, that I might definitely settle the rhythm,
              the metre, and the length and general arrangement of the stanza — as well as graduate the stanzas which were to precede, so that
              none of them might surpass this in rhythmical effect. Had I been able, in the subsequent composition, to construct more vigorous
              stanzas, I should, without scruple, have purposely enfeebled them, so as not to interfere with the climacteric effect. </p>
            <p> And here I may as well say a few words of the versification. My first object (as usual) was originality. The extent to
              which this has been neglected, in versification, is one of the most unaccountable things in the world. Admitting that there is little <a name="pg0166"><span>[page&nbsp;166:]</span></a> possibility of variety in mere <i>rhythm,</i> it is still clear that the
              possible varieties of metre and stanza are absolutely infinite — and yet, <i>for centuries, no man, in verse, has ever done, or
                ever seemed to think of doing, an original thing.</i> The fact is, originality (unless in minds of very unusual force) is by no means
              a matter, as some suppose, of impulse or intuition. In general, to be found, it must be elaborately sought, and although a positive
              merit of the highest class, demands in its attainment less of invention than negation. </p>
            <p> Of course, I pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of the “Raven.” The former is trochaic
              — the latter is octametre acatalectic, alternating with heptameter catalectic repeated in the <i>refrain</i> of the fifth verse,
              and terminating with tetrameter catalectic. Less pedantically — the feet employed throughout (trochees) consist of a long syllable
              followed by a short: the first line of the stanza consists of eight of these feet — the second of seven and a half (in effect
              two-thirds) — the third of eight — the fourth of seven and a half — the fifth the same — the sixth three and a
              half. Now, each of these lines, taken individually, has been employed before, and what originality the “Raven” has, is in
              their <i>combination into stanza;</i> nothing even remotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted. The effect of this
              originality of combination is aided by other unusual, and some altogether novel effects, arising from an extension of the application of
              the principles of rhyme and alliteration. </p>
            <p> The next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the lover and the Raven — and the first branch
              of this consideration was the <i>locale</i>. For this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a forest, or the fields — but
              it has always appeared to me that a close <i>circumscription of space</i> is absolutely necessary to the effect of insulated incident:
              — it has the force of a frame to a picture. It has an indisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention, and, of
              course, must not be confounded with mere unity of place. </p>
            <p> I determined, then, to place the lover in his chamber — in a chamber rendered sacred to him by memories of her
              who had frequented it. The room is represented as richly furnished — this in mere pursuance of the ideas I have already explained
              on the subject of Beauty, as the sole true poetical thesis. </p>
            <p> The <i>locale</i> being thus determined, I had now to introduce the bird — and the thought of introducing him
              through the window, was inevitable. The idea of making the lover suppose, in the first instance, that the flapping of the wings of the
              bird against the shutter, is a “tapping” at the door, originated in a wish to increase, by prolonging, the reader’s
              curiosity, and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising from the lover’s throwing open the door, finding all dark, and
              thence adopting the half-fancy that it was the spirit of his mistress that knocked. </p>
            <p> I made the night tempestuous, first, to account for the Raven’s seeking admission, and secondly, for the effect
              of contrast with the (physical) serenity within the chamber. </p>
            <p> I made the bird alight on the bust of Pallas, also for <b>[column 2:]</b> the effect of contrast between the marble and
              the plumage — it being understood that the bust was absolutely <i>suggested</i> by the bird — the bust of <i>Pallas</i>
              being chosen, first, as most in keeping with the scholarship of the lover, and, secondly, for the sonorousness of the word, Pallas,
              itself. </p>
            <p> About the middle of the poem, also, I have availed myself of the force of contrast, with a view of deepening the
              ultimate impression. For example, an air of the fantastic — approaching as nearly to the ludicrous as was admissible — is
              given to the Raven’s entrance. He comes in “with many a flirt and flutter. </p>
            <div>
              <p> Not the <i>least obeisance made he — </i> not a moment stopped or stayed he, </p>
              <p>
                <i>But with mien of lord or lady,</i> perched above my chamber door. </p>
            </div>
            <p> In the two stanzas which follow, the design is more obviously carried out: — </p>
            <div>
              <p> Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling </p>
              <p> By the <i>grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,</i>
              </p>
              <p> “Though thy <i>crest be shorn and shaven</i> thou,” I said, “art sure no craven, </p>
              <p> Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the nightly shore — </p>
              <p> Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!” </p>
              <p> Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” </p>
              <p> —— </p>
              <p> Much I marvelled <i>this ungainly fowl</i> to hear discourse so plainly, </p>
              <p> Though its answer little meaning — little relevancy bore; </p>
              <p> For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being </p>
              <p>
                <i>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door — </i>
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</i>
              </p>
              <p> With such name as “Nevermore.” </p>
              <p> —— </p>
            </div>
            <p> The effect of the <i>dénouement</i> being thus provided for, I immediately drop the fantastic for a tone of the
              most profound seriousness: — this tone commencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted, with the line, </p>
            <p> But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only, etc. </p>
            <p> From this epoch the lover no longer jests — no longer sees any thing even of the fantastic in the Raven’s
              demeanor. He speaks of him as a “grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore,” and feels the “fiery
              eyes” burning into his “bosom’s core.” This revolution of thought, or fancy, on the lover’s part, is
              intended to induce a similar one on the part of the reader — to bring the mind into a proper frame for the <i>dénouement
                — </i> which is now brought about as rapidly and as <i>directly</i> as possible. </p>
            <p> With the <i>dénouement</i> proper — with the Raven’s reply, “Nevermore,” to the
              lover’s final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another world — the poem, in its obvious phase, that of a simple
              narrative, may be said to have its completion. So far, every thing is within the limits of the accountable — of the real. A raven,
              having learned by rote the single word “Nevermore,” and having escaped from the custody of its owner, is driven, at
              midnight, through the violence of a storm, to seek admission at a window from which a light still gleams — the chamber-window of a
              student, occupied half in poring over a volume, half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased. <a name="pg0167"><span>[page&nbsp;167:]</span></a> The casement being thrown open at the fluttering of the bird’s wings, the bird
              itself perches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the student, who, amused by the incident and the oddity of the
              visiter’s demeanor, demands of it, in jest and without looking for a reply, its name. The raven addressed, answers with its
              customary word, “Nevermore” — a word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart of the student, who, giving
              utterance aloud to certain thoughts suggested by the occasion, is again startled by the fowl’s repetition of
              “Nevermore.” The student now guesses the state of the case, but is impelled, as I have before explained, by the human thirst
              for self-torture, and in part by superstition, to propound such queries to the bird as will bring him, the lover, the most of the luxury
              of sorrow, through the anticipated answer “Nevermore.” With the indulgence, to the utmost extreme, of this self-torture, the
              narration, in what I have termed its first or obvious phase, has a natural termination, and so far there has been no overstepping of the
              limits of the real. </p>
            <p> But in subjects so handled, however skilfully, or with however vivid an array of incident, there is always a certain
              hardness or nakedness, which repels the artistical eye. Two things are invariably required — first, some amount of complexity, or
              more properly, adaptation; and, secondly, some amount of suggestiveness — some under[[-]]current, however indefinite of meaning.
              It is this latter, in especial, which imparts to a work of art so much of that <i>richness</i> (to <b>[column 2:]</b> borrow from
              colloquy a forcible term) which we are too fond of confounding with <i>the ideal.</i> It is the <i>excess</i> of the suggested meaning
              — it is the rendering this the upper instead of the under[[-]]current of the theme — which turns into prose (and that of the
              very flattest kind) the so called poetry of the so called transcendentalists. </p>
            <p> Holding these opinions, I added the two concluding stanzas of the poem — their suggestiveness being thus made to
              pervade all the narrative which has preceded them. The under-current of meaning is rendered first apparent in the lines — </p>
            <div>
              <p> “Take thy beak from out <i>my heart,</i> and take thy form from off my door!” </p>
              <p> Quoth the Raven “Nevermore!” </p>
            </div>
            <p> It will be observed that the words, “from out my heart,” involve the first metaphorical expression in the
              poem. They, with the answer, “Nevermore,” dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been previously narrated. The
              reader begins now to regard the Raven as emblematical — but it is not until the very last line of the very last stanza, that the
              intention of making him emblematical of <i>Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance</i> is permitted distinctly to be seen: </p>
            <div>
              <p> And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting, </p>
              <p> On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; </p>
              <p> And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming, </p>
              <p> And the lamplight o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; </p>
              <p> And my soul <i>from out that shadow</i> that lies floating on the floor </p>
              <p> Shall be lifted — nevermore. </p>
            </div>
