    <p>The Hidden Number Problem (HNP) is a problem that poses the question: Are the most signficant bits of a Diffie-Hellman shared key as hard to compute as the entire secret? The original problem was defined in the paper 

<a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/abstracts/dhmsb.html" target="_blank">“Hardness of computing the most significant bits of secret keys in Diffie-Hellman and related schemes” by Dan Boneh and Ramarathnam Venkatesan</a>.</p>
<p>In this paper Boneh and Venkatesan demonstrate that a bounded number of most signifcant bits of a shared secret are as hard to compute as the entire secret itself. They also demonstrate an efficient algorithm for recovering secrets given a significant enough bit leakage. This notebook walks through some of the paper and demonstrates some of the results.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-the-hnp-defined">How is the HNP defined?</h2>
<p>Like many “hard problems” in cryptography the HNP is defined as a game with an “oracle”. When the oracle is queried with a specific number, it returns a value that approximately reveals the most significant bits of the input.</p>
<p>To be concrete, the oracle depends on a <span><span id="MJXp-Span-1"><span id="MJXp-Span-2">n</span></span></span>-bit prime number <span><span id="MJXp-Span-3"><span id="MJXp-Span-4">p</span></span></span> and a <span><span id="MJXp-Span-5"><span id="MJXp-Span-6">k</span></span></span>-bit significant bit leak.

<p>There are a few variations on this problem described in the paper, however, this “randomized” version of the HNP is the only version of the problem we'll focus on.</p>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="what-is-the-msb-function-revealing">What is the MSB function revealing?</h2>
<p>Something worth noting about this paper is their defintion of most signficant bits. The definition of <span>MSB_k</span> tripped me up at first as I defaulted to thinking <span>MSB_{k}(x)</span> was intended to reveal exactly the <span>k</span> most significant bits of <span>x</span>. If you think the same you may discover:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This definition is defined for “some value of <span>z</span>” which means <span>MSB_{k}(x)</span> can have multiple correct outputs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This definition depends on a prime value <span>p</span> which shouldn't affect <span>x</span>'s most significant bits!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties of <span>MSB</span> are very unlike the properties I would expect from the most natural definition of most significant bits. This is why earlier I specified that the value revealed by the oracle <em>approximately</em> reveals the most signficant bits of the input.</p>
<p>So how do you make sense of the <span>MSB</span> function? I found the following observations helped me grok what it was doing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>u = x</span> will always be one valid solution satsifying the inequality <span>| x - u | \leq \frac{p}{2^{k+1}}</span>. Note that if <span>u = x</span> the oracle's output would be <span>x</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other solutions to the inequality will “hover” around <span>x</span>. Plotting the function <code>f(u) = | x - u |</code> for some fixed <span>x</span> values should convince you of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As <span>k</span> increases, the right hand side of the inequality greatly shrinks. This reduces the set of valid <span>u</span> solutions. This also means the set of valid <span>u</span> values are also closer to <span>x</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <span>k</span> value isn't exactly the number of bits of <span>x</span> revealed. Instead, as <span>k</span> increase, the possible values of <span>u</span>s become closer to <span>x</span>. The closer <span>u</span> solutions are to <span>x</span>, the more likely <span>x - u</span> will accurately reveal <span>x</span>'s most significant bits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to say it: As <span>k</span> grows closer to the number of bits in <span>p</span>, the closer <span>MSB_k(x)</span> will be to <span>x</span>. The closer the possible answers of <span>MSB_k(x)</span> are to <span>x</span> the more accurate the leaked bits are.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-the-hnp-solvable">When is the HNP solvable?</h2>
<p>In Section 3 Theorem 1 the paper shows that an adversary has an advantage in solving an instance of the randomized HNP given a <span>k</span> value that is approximately <span>\sqrt{\log{p}}</span> using <span>d = 2\sqrt{n}</span> oracle queries. For this demonstration, I used a more significant <span>k</span> value: <span>\sqrt{\log{p}} + \log{\log{p}} = \sqrt{n} + \log{n}</span>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># d - The number of oracle queries.</span>
<span># Using parameters from Thereom 1.</span>
d <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> ceil(sqrt(n))
</code></pre></div><h2 id="given-a-useful-oracle-how-do-i-solve-the-hnp">Given a useful oracle, how do I solve the HNP?</h2>
<p>I'm trying to summarize an otherwise dense paper, so I likely have some of this wrong. With that being said…</p>
<p>Given <span>d</span> oracle queries and answers, solving the HNP can be done by viewing the solution as a specific case of the 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem" target="_blank">Closest Vector Problem</a>. This case of CVP is easy to solve given an useful enough <span>MSB</span> oracle and a specially selected basis.</p>
<p>This special case CVP uses a lattice with the basis vectors:</p>
<pre><code>[  p,  0, ... ,  0,   0 ]
[  0,  p, ... ,  0,   0 ]
[         ...           ]
[  0,  0, ... ,  p,   0 ]
[ t1, t2, ... , td, 1/p ]
</code></pre><p>Where <span>t_N</span> values are randomized inputs for the <span>MSB</span> oracle. The lattice is spanned by the rows of this matrix.</p>
<p>The vector <span>u</span> = <code>[a1, a2, ..., ad, 0]</code> is the vector that we want to find a close lattice point to. The <span>a_N</span> values are the outputs of the <span>MSB</span> oracle for the respective <span>t_N</span> values.</p>
<p>A vector with the first coefficient <span>\alpha t_1 \pmod{p}</span> (for example) can be a valid lattice point as <span>\alpha</span> is an integer scalar of the last row, and <span>\pmod{p}</span> is equivalent to subtracting some integer multiple of the first row.</p>
<p>The vector <span>v</span> is a lattice vector such that each element of <span>v</span> is <span>\alpha t_n \pmod{p}</span> except for the <span>d+1</span>th coefficient which is <span>\frac{\alpha}{p}</span>. Given the vector <span>v</span>, we can recover <span>\alpha</span> easily by scaling the vector by <span>p</span>.</p>
<p>By the definition of the <span>MSB</span> oracle, the vector <span>u</span> is likely to be close to <span>v</span>. The paper proves this. The paper also proves that <span>v</span> is a likely to be the only vector close to <span>u</span>.</p>
<p>Given all of this, we can use a efficient algorithm that solves approximate CVP (e.g. 

<a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/~shashank_r/lattice.pdf" target="_blank">Babai's Nearest Plane Algorithm</a>) for <span>u</span>. This is likely to find our friend <span>v</span> which reveals <span>\alpha</span>. This means we solved a case of the HNP!</p>

<p>I also wrote this originally using Sage's <code>IntegerLattice</code> module which has a <code>closest_vector</code> method. However this was non-ideal because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>IntegerLattice</code> requires integer coefficient basis vectors but the HNP uses <span>\frac{1}{p}</span> as one of the coefficients. This was addressable, as I just scaled the basis and the CVP vectors by a value of <span>p</span>.</p>

<li>
<p><code>IntegerLattice.closest_vector</code> is slow, as it solves a more general problem then approximate CVP.</p>
