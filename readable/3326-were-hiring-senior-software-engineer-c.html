(Senior Software Engineer, C++)</h1><div><div class="text"><p>Spry Fox is looking for a senior engineer, experienced with C++ (and ideally with Unreal 4 as well) to help us work on a new, original game.<span id="more-49725"></span></p><p><strong>Who do we want?</strong></p><p>You‚Äôll be part of a prototyping project with one designer, one producer and two additional engineers. (The prototype has already been in development for almost a year and is showing lots of potential.) You‚Äôll be working in Unreal Engine 4.</p><p><strong>You must:</strong></p><ul><li>Have at least five full years of professional game development experience</li><li>Be very comfortable and experienced with C++</li><li>Be very comfortable working remotely (we‚Äôre a virtual studio; everyone works from home!)</li><li>Speak and write in fluent English</li><li>Live in a US-adjacent timezone, or are willing to work funny hours to ensure at least partial overlap with those of us in the US-adjacent timezones (which is the majority of the studio, but not all of it.)</li><li>Want to make the world a better place</li></ul><p><strong>While not required, it would be nice if you also:</strong></p><ul><li>Have Unreal Engine 4 experience</li><li>Have some multiplayer development experience</li><li>Have interests outside of game development</li><li>Have shipped several games</li></ul><p><strong>What are we offering?</strong></p><ul><li>40 hours a week</li><li>Any necessary software licenses</li><li>Interesting, highly original work in a small, supportive, and friendly team that views itself as a family first and a business second</li></ul><p>We love to see candidates from under-represented backgrounds. If you think you might fit our needs but aren‚Äôt sure, please, don‚Äôt hold back! Send us your resume. The absolute worst that could happen is that we‚Äôll receive your email with gratitude and let you know that while this opportunity might not be the best fit for you, others we‚Äôll have in the future could be. Best case, you‚Äôve got yourself a new job with people who are psyched that you took a chance on us. üôÇ</p><p>Please send your full resume, references, and anything else you think we should see to <strong><a href="mailto:jobs@spryfox.com">jobs@spryfox.com</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>What‚Äôs it like working for Spry Fox?</strong></p><p>Spry Fox‚Äôs motto is ‚Äúmake the world a better place.‚Äù We try to do that through the games we make, whether that‚Äôs by designing our MMO, Steambirds Alliance, to be a game that encourages the development of friendships and discourages toxicity, or by designing our puzzle game, Alphabear 2, to promote English language learning. We‚Äôre always asking ourselves ‚Äúhow does this game improve your life?‚Äù</p><p>We also strive to be a company that is a pleasure to work for. We hope to be an important but not dominating part of your life. We want you to have friends, family, hobbies, and a life outside of work. We want you to love your colleagues and know that they support you 100%. We want you to be proud of what you do and how you do it.</p><p>We make highly original games. Invention is part of our DNA. You‚Äôll be working on designs that often don‚Äôt fit in a comfy genre box.</p><p>We‚Äôre fully remote, which means you have the flexibility to work your 40 hours a week from where ever you like, and in whatever configuration you‚Äôd like. Take a mid-afternoon break to spend time with the kids! Start late because you‚Äôve got a few errands to run this morning! As long as you have an overlap with your team almost every day, let people know what you‚Äôre up to, and don‚Äôt leave the rest of us hanging, almost anything goes.</p><p>We currently have Foxes in Europe, South Africa, South America, Canada, and the US. We have a retreat once a year to come together, bond, discuss the long-term future of projects and the company, and stay up way too late chatting around campfires.</p><p>We have lives outside of work. Lots of us have children. Different Foxes enjoy playing music, reading books, storytelling RPGs, solving rubiks cubes, talking politics, and/or traveling. Some of us even play games. üòâ</p><p>Spry Fox recognizes crunch is a negative and counter-productive practice in our industry. While we can‚Äôt pretend that we‚Äôve never crunched before, we make a constant effort to limit it, and we consider more than a couple of weeks of crunch to be a failure of management ‚Äî something to be learned from and avoided in the future. We have never crunched for more than six weeks in the nine year history of our studio.</p><p>If you‚Äôd like to learn more about us, please watch this short documentary video about Spry Fox that was filmed a couple years back!</p><div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled"></div></div></div></div></div>
