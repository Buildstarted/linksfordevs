<p>Running this web site since year 2007, I receive some email feedback regarding my articles from readers every month. About 20% of the conversations I get are shocking: They are absolutely horrible in the quality of the ideas and the writing, and they often demand personalized help <em>without showing any skill or effort</em>. (The other 80% of feedback are generally interesting and <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/decent-feedback-from-readers">decent</a>, and those examples are hosted on a separate page.)</p>
<p>As for the poor feedback, please <strong>don’t</strong> send me messages that look like the examples below! Read the text and judge for yourself. There exist needy, thankless people out there in the world.</p>

		<p><i>My commentary: You can keep on waiting, because free help won’t be offered. This is the same guy who contacted me on 2020-03-11 and 2020-02-26. The linked page isn’t <strong>my</strong> post on GitHub; someone copied text from my web page and posted it on their account. As for your request, your spelling is sloppy, but more importantly you severely underestimate the complexity of implementing a “simple requirement” to modify a QR Code generator and scanner to be incompatible with the existing standard.</i></p>

			<p>Subject line: A programming problem</p>
			<p>Hello again. How do you think, what would be the most efficient solution to this problem:</p>
			<p>Let's say there is a bit field, call it <i>flags</i>. The goal is to fill <i>flags</i> from the position zero up to a desired position, which is specified by a flag, e.g. 1&lt;&lt;4. As a result a binary sequence 10000 would become 11111. My current solution (in Java) is:</p>
			<p>for (int i=0; i &lt; (int)(log(flag)/log(2)); i++) {
				flags |= 1&lt;&lt;i;
			}</p>
			<p>Maybe there is a more efficient or traditional approach I am not aware of?</p>

		<p><i>My commentary: Your initial request doesn’t make sense, you’re asking me for code that I haven’t written or published, and your wording is very sloppy. Also, the fact that you linked to a file in my GitHub mirror of web-published code (which I consider a secondary source) suggests that you might not have thoroughly read my official web page (whose URL is included in the source code). As a rule of thumb, the more desperately you plead for help, the less likely I am to grant you my charity.</i></p>

			<p>i found your site, and i was wondering if it is possible to store the letters. i know how to store numbers in letters, but i want to know if u can store letters/formulas in a letter... if u know what i mean...<br />
			lets say (a-b)^2 = (a-b)(a-b)<br />
			or if thats not possible, maybe just (a-b)(a-b) or anything like that stored into letter A ??</p>

			<p>Hello my friend,<br />
			I'm looking for your Automatic Caesar cipher breaker. It's very useful tutorial to be honest with you  but I don't understand very much the idea how to break the cipher text ?<br />
			What I understand is :     1. I need to calculate the number of times for each letter<br />
			2. then I need to compare with letter frequency on english language<br />
			3. after that ... What I need to do ? and how can I get the key ?</p>

			<p>Hello,</p>
			<p>I have recently visited your site to view how others had solved the "Dwite Computing Competition" problems. As i am a beginner at Java, i was unable to understand how you had solved the problems, although, i am very much interested in finding out. If it is not too much of a bother, i would greatly appreciate if you could send me things such as tutorials which you find would help me to learn Java. I am not completely new at coding, and i know the basics but i haven't gotten the logic and many of the functions of Java yet.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The quoted messages are largely unmodified. Only these modifications were made:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The name of the person was abbreviated (e.g. John Smith into JS), to protect their dignity or what remains thereof.</li>
	<li>Some hard line breaks were removed for better readability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, nothing else was changed. In particular, the spelling, grammar, punctuation, and spacing are exactly the way the person wrote them.</p>
<p>I noticed that being addressed as “sir” is strongly correlated with the sender being from India. I conjecture that it might be taught as a respectful form of addressing someone, but I personally find it to be very cold and distancing. That being said, I am not inviting you to feign familiarity with me either.</p>
<p>Don’t get the misimpression that all my emails from readers are bad, though. The majority of the feedback <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/decent-feedback-from-readers">has been good</a>, ranging from compliments to academic research to relevant ideas to business deals. I’ve only highlighted the bad ones here to illustrate a minor burden that comes from being an author on the web.</p>
