<p>Authentication is an overloaded word in cryptography.</p>
<p>In the context of <strong>cryptographic primitives</strong> like message authentication codes (MACs) and authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD), authentication really refers to authenticity or integrity. And as the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/authenticity">Cambridge dictionary</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Authenticity</strong>. the quality of being real or true.<br>
The poems are supposed to be by Sappho, but they are actually of doubtful authenticity.<br>
The authenticity of her story is beyond doubt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proof is in the pudding. When talking about the security properties of primitives like MACs, cryptography talks about <strong>unforgeability</strong>, which does relate to authenticity.</p>
<p>So whenever you hear things like "<em>is this payload authenticated with HMAC?</em>", think authenticity, think integrity.</p>
<p>In the context of <strong>protocols</strong> though (e.g. TLS) authentication refers to <strong>identification</strong>: the concept of <strong>proving who you are</strong>.</p>
<p>So whenever you hear things like "<em>Is the server authenticated?</em>", think "identities are being proven".</p>
<p>This dual sense really annoys me, but in the end this ambiguity is encompassed in the definition of authentication:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the process or action of proving or showing something to be true, genuine, or valid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dfaranha/status/1221558605259988994">Diego F. Aranha</a> proposes a clever way to disambiguate the two:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>origin/entity authentication</strong>. You're proving that an entity really is who they say they are.</li>
<li><strong>message authentication</strong>. You're proving that a message is genuine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that an argument against this distinction is the following: to authenticate a message, you need a key. This key comes from somewhere (it's your context, or your "who"). So when you authenticate a message, you are really authenticating the context. This falls short in scenarios where for example you trust the root hash of a merkle tree, which authenticates all of its leaves.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, authentication is about proving that something is what it is supposed to be. And that thing can be a person, or a message, or maybe even something else.</p>
<p>This is not all. In the security world people are confused with authorization vs authentication :)</p>
