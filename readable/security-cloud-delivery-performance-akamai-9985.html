<h2>Presentation Descriptions</h2>
<p><strong>Intelligent Security Starts at the Edge</strong><br> Learn how Akamai makes the Internet fast, reliable and secure for customers the world over. Find out how our cloud delivery platform -- the world‚Äôs largest and most trusted -- empowers our customers to provide the best and most secure digital experiences on any device, anytime, anywhere. We'll share an overview of our security solution portfolio and our Adaptive Threat Protection for digital enterprises.</p>
<p><strong>Designing for Doomsday: Effective API Security Approaches from the Edge</strong><br> API security has emerged as the single biggest challenge organizations face to securing their threat surface. In this session we will review real-world examples of how application and API design patterns expose businesses to risks ranging from misuse to outright abuse, and highlight why it's so challenging for businesses to detect and mitigate their exposure. By looking at threat intelligence data gleaned from billions of device and API interactions, we will show how to detect, defend, and ultimately design for doomsday so that you can stop the ticking clock and get back to business.</p>
<p><strong>Featured Keynote: Rise of the Breaches</strong><br> Data breaches are the new normal. We‚Äôve created ecosystems with so many moving parts and so many complex units, it‚Äôs little wonder that we so frequently see them go wrong. A combination of more systems, more people, more devices and more ways than ever of producing and publishing data stack the odds in favour of attackers breaching more systems than ever. In this talk by Troy Hunt, you‚Äôll get a look inside the world of data breaches based on his experiences dealing with billions of breached records. You‚Äôll see what‚Äôs motivating hackers, how they‚Äôre gaining access to data and how organisations are dealing with the aftermath of attacks. Most importantly, it will help you contextualise these incidents and understand both what these attacks actually look like and how to defend against them in your organisation.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Identity &amp; Access Management - Introducing Akamai Identity Cloud </strong><br> What is Customer Identity &amp; Access Management and how can it help? Come learn about why identity is a pressing challenge for today's digital businesses and how Akamai Identity Cloud, the market leader in CIAM, can help you better leverage customer identities to improve your customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Beyond Perimeter Security - Zero Trust, Does it Really Work? </strong><br> The ‚Äútrust but verify‚Äù security model is no longer effective as new business models and processes move users, devices, applications and data beyond the traditional enterprise perimeter. The surge in new attack surfaces demands a new approach to security in the form of a zero trust model. Find out the four steps to start a zero trust security journey and immediately improve defenses.</p>
<p><strong>Zero Trust in the Real World: Traditional VPN Access vs Zero Trust</strong><br> In this interactive demo, experience the parallel worlds where users interact with their corporate applications via VPN and Zero Trust Cloud. Join this lunch breakout session to see how by using Zero Trust, users are able to securely access authorized applications while hackers ‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say they are not!</p>
<p><strong>Credential Abuse: Detection Strategies, Understanding Your Attack Surface and Real-World Attack Examples</strong><br> Credential stuffing is among the top security challenges facing online businesses today. Come learn more about what credential abuse is and what you can do about it, including both solutions to address the problem as well as how your own application architecture could be making the problem worse.</p>
<p><strong>Securing Digital Experiences: Understanding the Nuances of Security in the Media Industry</strong><br> Did you know that over 390,000 new malicious programs are registered every day? As attack surfaces keep shifting, how do media companies keep up with malicious actors focused on exfiltrating data and attacking their infrastructure? Join our Security experts to get a holistic view of security threats in the Australian media industry and find out how you can identify, mitigate and manage these risks. You‚Äôll also hear from News Digital on how they build their security posture to protect their customers and intellectual property.</p></div>
