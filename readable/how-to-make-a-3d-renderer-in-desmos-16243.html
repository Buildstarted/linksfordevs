<p>A couple weeks ago, I was introduced to <a href="https://www.desmos.com/">Desmos</a>.</p>

<p>Desmos is an online graphing calculator. It can plot lots of different types of functions in a really intuitive way. But its real hook is that all of its graphs are interactive. You can define a variable and Desmos will automatically make a slider so you can change that variable’s value and see the result in real time. You can even click and drag points on the graph itself. It makes math so tangible and I love it.</p>

<p>Within the first day of using Desmos, an idea entered my mind that I couldn’t shake: if Desmos can make 2D graphs so interactive, could it do the same for 3D?</p>

<p>It turns out, <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ersamusmyo">the answer is yes</a>.</p>



<p>Making this happen pushed the features of Desmos to the absolute limit. In this article I want to give a more detailed breakdown of how it’s done.</p>

<p>Before we get into Desmos itself, we need to cover the math of 3D rendering.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-the-math-work">How does the math work?</h2>

<p>At a high level, 3D rendering is just a long series of transformations. We want to take a set of points in 3D space and move, rotate, stretch, and flatten them until they’re all where we want them in a 2D image. Before we can dig into the details of each transformation, though, we need to look at the big picture.</p>

<p>Let’s start with what we know:</p>

<ul>
<li>We’re going to have a <em>model</em> to render, like the cube in my example. For me, the model is just a list of points in 3D space. The model can have its own position and rotation in the scene that we’re going to render. (In my renderer, I only have controls for rotation.)</li>
<li>We’re also going to have a <em>camera</em>, which defines the point of view of the image. The camera will have its own position and rotation, plus some camera-specific stuff like a field of view.</li>
</ul>



<p>So that’s the information we start with. We end with 2D points laid out so that they form an image from the camera’s point of view. How we get from start to finish goes through four stages. I’ll call those stages <strong>model space</strong>, <strong>world space</strong>, <strong>camera space</strong>, and <strong>projection space</strong>.</p>

<div>
  <div>
    
    <div>
      <figure>
        <div>
          






        </div>
        <figcaption>Camera Space</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <div>
          






        </div>
        <figcaption>Projection Space</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><strong>Model space</strong> is our starting point. The points of our model are centered around the origin (or the center of our world). When we create a model, we define all of its points in model space.</p>

<p>In <strong>world space</strong>, everything is placed where it belongs in our 3D scene. You can see that the model is rotated to a new orientation, and our camera has been moved and rotated to point at it.</p>

<p>In <strong>camera space</strong>, we shift everything in the scene so that the camera is at the center, pointing forward. We’re effectively moving everything to the camera’s point of view. This might seem like a surprising step, but it makes the next stage much easier.</p>

<p>Finally, in <strong>projection space</strong>, we flatten the world down from three dimensions to two. This is where the camera’s field of view comes into play, because we use it to give our final image a sense of perspective.</p>

<p>Once we’re in projection space, we are working in two dimensions! All that remains is to plot those 2D points and we have ourselves an image.</p>



<p>Now let’s get into the nitty-gritty of how to do this.</p>

<h3 id="some-small-prerequisites">Some small prerequisites</h3>

<p>Graphics math is all about vectors and matrices. In our case, we use vectors to represent the points of our model and matrices to represent ways of transforming them. If you’ve never encountered vectors before, the best way to get up to speed is 3blue1brown’s excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of Linear Algebra</a> series on Youtube. For what we’re doing, you only need the information from the first four videos, which should take you less than an hour to get through.</p>

<p>You really should watch those videos; they explain the basics far better than I can. But here’s my whirlwind summary of the parts we’ll be using:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We’ll use vectors to represent the points of our model. Although our points are all three-dimensional, we actually will be using four-dimensional vectors to represent them. The first three components will be the x, y, and z of the point as you would expect. The last component of the vector will just be the number 1. For example, a 3D point with an X position of 1, a Y position of 2, and a Z position of 3 would look like:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/prereq-vec.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/prereq-vec_hu7d92c5ed30bdd9982a8be74939178d64_5643_46x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
</li>

<li><p>We’ll use matrices to represent transformations. I’m omitting the details, but for example, a matrix that rotates vectors by 90° around the y axis would look like:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/prereq-mat.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/prereq-mat_hu501759cc1fc645b7326b207f586bdb11_11728_162x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
</li>

<li><p>Multiplying a vector by a matrix transforms that vector accordingly. For example, here is what it looks like to rotate our example vector by 90 degrees around the Y axis, color-coded so it’s easier to follow:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/prereq-mult.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/prereq-mult_huc61d494fc6ba008913b39987542adc16_80243_602x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>If you have never seen this kind of multiplication before, I recommend trying to see how this one fits together. I’ll be glossing over some details throughout this article, but parts of it will still make more sense if you have an idea of how this works.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, it probably seems strange to use four-dimensional vectors to represent three-dimensional data, but the reason we do it is pretty interesting. The short version is that we can do a clever trick with a fourth dimension to do some transformations that wouldn’t otherwise be possible with matrices. The long version will have to wait for another blog post, but if you’re impatient, just look up “homogeneous coordinates”.</p>

<h3 id="model-space-to-world-space">Model space to world space</h3>



<p>The first major transformation is going from model space to world space, where the model gets placed into our overall scene. For my renderer, I chose to do just two rotations, since it made the controls easy. I first rotate the model about the X axis, then about the Y axis - you could do the rotations in a different order, but I liked the results I got with that.</p>

<p>Order matters when multiplying vectors and matrices - we always have the matrix on the left and the vector on the right. But this means that a series of transformations gets built up from right to left, instead of left to right as you might expect. To rotate first by X, then by Y, our equation will look like:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/eq-model2world.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/eq-model2world_hu3aac95df6cf157eae443cb05df9cf247_12282_319x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>A more general-purpose renderer could add lots more to this step - for example, moving the model around in space, rotating along the Z axis, or scaling it up and down. But a little rotation is enough for now.</p>

<h3 id="world-space-to-camera-space">World space to camera space</h3>



<p>We now have to go from world space to camera space, where the camera is at the center. This is very similar to our last step - but there’s a twist.</p>

<p>In the last step, our model started at the origin and we moved it somewhere else. This time, our camera is somewhere else and we want to move it <em>back</em> to the origin. This means that we need to find the transformations that would move the camera to the right place, but then do those transformations in reverse.</p>

<p>To show you why this works, let’s step back to two dimensions for a bit. Say we want to shift everything in this picture so that the blue triangle is at the origin. It’s at the coordinates <span><span id="MJXp-Span-2"><span id="MJXp-Span-3"><span id="MJXp-Span-4"><span>[</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-5"><span><span id="MJXp-Span-6"><span id="MJXp-Span-7"><span id="MJXp-Span-8">1</span></span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-9"><span id="MJXp-Span-10"><span id="MJXp-Span-11">2</span></span></span></span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-12"><span>]</span></span></span></span></span>. What transformation do we have to do to put it back?</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/shapes-before.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/shapes-before_hu271a7a1a58ac84c9b11d99394e77defa_24867_279x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Since the triangle is right by 1 and up by 2, we need to shift everything <em>left</em> by 1 and <em>down</em> by 2. If the coordinates are <span><span id="MJXp-Span-13"><span id="MJXp-Span-14"><span id="MJXp-Span-15"><span>[</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-16"><span><span id="MJXp-Span-17"><span id="MJXp-Span-18"><span id="MJXp-Span-19">1</span></span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-20"><span id="MJXp-Span-21"><span id="MJXp-Span-22">2</span></span></span></span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-23"><span>]</span></span></span></span></span>, the transformation we need to do is <span><span id="MJXp-Span-24"><span id="MJXp-Span-25"><span id="MJXp-Span-26"><span>[</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-27"><span><span id="MJXp-Span-28"><span id="MJXp-Span-29"><span id="MJXp-Span-30">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-31">1</span></span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-32"><span id="MJXp-Span-33"><span id="MJXp-Span-34">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-35">2</span></span></span></span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-36"><span>]</span></span></span></span></span>.</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/shapes-after.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/shapes-after_hu13abfc9fa8c08c2d7a8a363b49a26b0c_24428_236x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>This applies to rotations too. If the triangle were rotated by by 30 degrees, we would need to rotate it by -30 degrees to undo the rotation.</p>

<p>Let’s jump back to our scene now. The camera in our scene has been moved and rotated. The sequence of transformations to move it to the right place is: Rotate X, Rotate Y, Move. To undo those transformations, we do: Move, Rotate Y, Rotate X.</p>



<p>Our equation to move a vector <span><span id="MJXp-Span-37"><span id="MJXp-Span-38"><span id="MJXp-Span-39"><span><span><span><span id="MJXp-Span-41">→</span></span><span><span id="MJXp-Span-40">v</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> from world space to camera space is therefore:</p>

        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>And our whole equation so far is:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/eq-2camera.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/eq-2camera_hub9743044d8d6b3f618940de8943e8303_47673_631x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<h3 id="camera-space-to-projection-space">Camera space to projection space</h3>



<p>There’s just one more transformation to make, and that is the perspective projection. It is finally time to convert our 3D points into 2D points, but we need to make sure that the camera’s perspective is taken into account. But what does that perspective actually mean for our image?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the camera’s field of view. These dashed lines represent the boundaries of what the camera can see, and I’ve highlighted a certain chunk of the camera’s view for us to look at. You can see it sort of looks like a pyramid with the top chopped off - this shape is called a <em>frustum</em>. Also notice in this picture that we have drawn a couple squares on each end of the frustum, both the same size.</p>



<p>Let’s think about what those squares would look like in our final image. We know that things closer to the camera appear bigger, and things farther from the camera appear smaller, so whatever transformation we do should have that effect on those squares.</p>

<p>The trick to perspective projection is to imagine stretching and squishing the ends of the frustum so that they’re the same size. When we’re done, we no longer have a frustum - we have a perfectly rectangular box.</p>



<p>You can see that this stretching motion made the blue front square bigger and the red back square smaller! Now we can flatten the points down along the Z axis to be left with a lovely 2D image:</p>



<p>And that’s it! Now that we have a set of 2D points, we can simply tell Desmos to plot them and we’re done.</p>

<p>Our final equation is therefore:</p>

    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/eq-2projection.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/eq-2projection_hu529e8b6de7022c958c2de2db262b19a2_63292_760x0_resize_box_2.png">

<h2 id="doing-linear-algebra-in-desmos">Doing linear algebra in Desmos</h2>

<p>It’s all well and good that we know the math - but now we need to implement the math in Desmos!</p>

<p>In order to render an image, we need to figure out how to represent both vectors and matrices in Desmos. More precisely, we need to represent vectors and <em>multiplying</em> those vectors by matrices.</p>

<p>We’ll start with vectors, since our model is basically nothing but a list of vectors anyway. Desmos actually doesn’t have a lot of features for us to choose from here - the only thing that really works is a <em>list</em>.</p>

<p>A list in Desmos looks like a list of things inside square brackets and separated by commas. For example, we could make a list of numbers like <span><span id="MJXp-Span-42"><span id="MJXp-Span-43">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-44">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-45">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-46">2</span><span id="MJXp-Span-47">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-48">3</span><span id="MJXp-Span-49">]</span></span></span>, or a list of 2D points like <span><span id="MJXp-Span-50"><span id="MJXp-Span-51"><span id="MJXp-Span-52">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-53">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-54">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-55">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-56">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-57">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-58">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-59">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-60">2</span><span id="MJXp-Span-61">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-62">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-63">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-64">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-65">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-66">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-67">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-68">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-69">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-70">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-71">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-72">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-73">]</span></span></span></span>.</p>









<p>A vector as we use it is basically just a list of numbers, so you’d think Desmos’s lists would work well for this. But Desmos has an important limitation that will make life more difficult: it does not allow <em>lists of lists</em>. So while it can do a list of numbers, or a list of points, we couldn’t, for example, do the following:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/list-nest.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/list-nest_hu784a7aafe910129834fcbda3cf773f28_7336_209x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>This is a problem for us, because if we represent vectors with lists, but our model is a list of vectors, then we have a list of lists. There aren’t any other built-in features of Desmos to use, so let’s explore a couple workarounds:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Workaround 1: separate lists for each component</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps we could just put all the x’s in one list, all the y’s in another, and all the z’s in another still. Then we would only have three lists, and maybe we could make that work with our matrix math later on.</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/list-separate.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/list-separate_hu8795ed854ff975f90ac93412c25b7949_9272_136x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Unfortunately, this doesn’t work because we actually end up with a list of lists again as soon as we try to use these. The reason why is pretty simple - mathematical functions can take many values as input, but produce only one value as output. A matrix-vector multiplication function would need to take separate lists of x, y, and z, but also produce three lists with the x, y, and z results. If Desmos allowed lists of lists, we could return a list containing all three. But it doesn’t, so we can’t. We’ll need to try another approach.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Workaround 2: pack everything into one big list</strong></p>

<p>Following from the last workaround, we know that the result of our functions has to be a single value. So it sounds like we need a way of packing all of our x’s, y’s, and z’s into a single list. The simplest way would be to simply go <span><span id="MJXp-Span-74"><span id="MJXp-Span-75">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-76">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-77">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-78">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-79">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-80">z</span><span id="MJXp-Span-81">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-82">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-83">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-84">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-85">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-86">z</span><span id="MJXp-Span-87">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-88">…</span><span id="MJXp-Span-89">]</span></span></span>. Luckily, it turns out that this will work!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we need to figure out what it looks like to do multiplication with a giant, packed list of points. This gets a little strange. We’ll stick to two dimensions for the sake of this example, but the technique we’re about to explore works for vectors of any length.</p>

<p>Every 2D matrix-vector multiplication looks like the following:</p>





<div>
    <div>

Suppose we start in Desmos with the list <span><span id="MJXp-Span-120"><span id="MJXp-Span-121">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-122"><span id="MJXp-Span-123">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-124">1</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-125">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-126"><span id="MJXp-Span-127">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-128">1</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-129">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-130"><span id="MJXp-Span-131">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-132">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-133">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-134"><span id="MJXp-Span-135">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-136">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-137">]</span></span></span>. After our transformation, according to what we’ve just seen, we would get <span><span id="MJXp-Span-138"><span id="MJXp-Span-139">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-140">a</span><span id="MJXp-Span-141"><span id="MJXp-Span-142">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-143">1</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-144">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-145">b</span><span id="MJXp-Span-146"><span id="MJXp-Span-147">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-148">1</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-149">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-150">c</span><span id="MJXp-Span-151"><span id="MJXp-Span-152">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-153">1</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-154">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-155">d</span><span id="MJXp-Span-156"><span id="MJXp-Span-157">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-158">1</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-159">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-160">a</span><span id="MJXp-Span-161"><span id="MJXp-Span-162">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-163">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-164">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-165">b</span><span id="MJXp-Span-166"><span id="MJXp-Span-167">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-168">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-169">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-170">c</span><span id="MJXp-Span-171"><span id="MJXp-Span-172">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-173">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-174">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-175">d</span><span id="MJXp-Span-176"><span id="MJXp-Span-177">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-178">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-179">]</span></span></span>.</p>

<p>If we put the lists side by side, it’s pretty clear how this needs to work:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/list-transform.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/list-transform_hud8e7db6ea83033eb6f728965c48cce88_41569_588x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>We need to find a way of making each <span><span id="MJXp-Span-180"><span id="MJXp-Span-181">x</span></span></span> “turn into” <span><span id="MJXp-Span-182"><span id="MJXp-Span-183">a</span><span id="MJXp-Span-184">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-185">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-186">b</span><span id="MJXp-Span-187">y</span></span></span>, and each <span><span id="MJXp-Span-188"><span id="MJXp-Span-189">y</span></span></span> “turn into” <span><span id="MJXp-Span-190"><span id="MJXp-Span-191">c</span><span id="MJXp-Span-192">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-193">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-194">d</span><span id="MJXp-Span-195">y</span></span></span>. And there is a way, but we’ll need to lay more groundwork first. There are four things we need to learn about before putting them all together: <strong>lists</strong>, <strong>piecewise functions</strong>, <strong>mod</strong>, and <strong>sums</strong>.</p>

        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/grocery-none.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/grocery-none_hu2ce9b1d904b14830ec08b687a0837591_22356_297x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>We already know what a list <em>is</em>, but let’s learn about everything you can do with them:</p>

<ul>
<li>To create a list, you simply put a list of numbers in brackets, like <span><span id="MJXp-Span-196"><span id="MJXp-Span-197">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-198">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-199">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-200">2</span><span id="MJXp-Span-201">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-202">3</span><span id="MJXp-Span-203">]</span></span></span>.</li>
<li>You can create long lists quickly by using ellipses: <span><span id="MJXp-Span-204"><span id="MJXp-Span-205">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-206">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-207">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-208">…</span><span id="MJXp-Span-209">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-210">5</span><span id="MJXp-Span-211">]</span></span></span> becomes <span><span id="MJXp-Span-212"><span id="MJXp-Span-213">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-214">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-215">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-216">2</span><span id="MJXp-Span-217">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-218">3</span><span id="MJXp-Span-219">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-220">4</span><span id="MJXp-Span-221">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-222">5</span><span id="MJXp-Span-223">]</span></span></span>.</li>
<li>You can get specific elements from a list by using square brackets: <span><span id="MJXp-Span-224"><span id="MJXp-Span-225">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-226">e</span><span id="MJXp-Span-227">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-228">π</span><span id="MJXp-Span-229">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-230">i</span><span id="MJXp-Span-231">]</span><span id="MJXp-Span-232">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-233">2</span><span id="MJXp-Span-234">]</span></span></span> yields <span><span id="MJXp-Span-235"><span id="MJXp-Span-236">π</span></span></span> (because <span><span id="MJXp-Span-237"><span id="MJXp-Span-238">π</span></span></span> was the second element of the list).</li>
<li>You can get the length of a list by using the special <span><span id="MJXp-Span-239"><span id="MJXp-Span-240">length</span></span></span> function: <span><span id="MJXp-Span-241"><span id="MJXp-Span-242">length</span><span id="MJXp-Span-243"></span><span id="MJXp-Span-244">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-245">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-246">e</span><span id="MJXp-Span-247">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-248">π</span><span id="MJXp-Span-249">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-250">i</span><span id="MJXp-Span-251">]</span><span id="MJXp-Span-252">)</span></span></span> yields <span><span id="MJXp-Span-253"><span id="MJXp-Span-254">3</span></span></span>.</li>
<li>You can use a list anywhere you would normally use a number: <span><span id="MJXp-Span-255"><span id="MJXp-Span-256">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-257">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-258">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-259">2</span><span id="MJXp-Span-260">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-261">3</span><span id="MJXp-Span-262">]</span><span id="MJXp-Span-263">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-264">2</span></span></span> yields <span><span id="MJXp-Span-265"><span id="MJXp-Span-266">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-267">3</span><span id="MJXp-Span-268">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-269">4</span><span id="MJXp-Span-270">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-271">5</span><span id="MJXp-Span-272">]</span></span></span>. As we’ll see, this feature interacts with other features of Desmos in some pretty interesting ways.</li>
</ul>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/grocery-2lists.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/grocery-2lists_hu5079e64f931df4f6662e1f8948e7ad4d_31565_297x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Now let’s learn about piecewise functions. Although you’re probably familiar with piecewise functions, you may not be familiar with how they look in Desmos. For example, let’s look at this function in both its usual mathematical notation, and in Desmos’s notation (plus a plot of the function so you can see it):</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/piecewise-2.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/piecewise-2_hud7d81966053bbd9257af622bd623baed_16081_375x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>










<p>Although Desmos’s notation looks a little different, it conveys the same idea. You can read Desmos’s out loud like “if x is less than n, the value is sin(x), otherwise, it’s -x”.</p>

<p>One interesting and important fact is that we can define more than two values for a piecewise function. In the usual notation, we can just add more rows, but in Desmos we can do the same by stacking piecewise functions together:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/piecewise-3.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/piecewise-3_huc38cd268c25a7a9a8234e046b3126e04_26214_638x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>










<p>Piecewise functions will be a very helpful building block for us because they will help us do different things for the x’s and y’s. You can imagine, for example, putting <span><span id="MJXp-Span-273"><span id="MJXp-Span-274">a</span><span id="MJXp-Span-275">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-276">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-277">b</span><span id="MJXp-Span-278">y</span></span></span> as the first value and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-279"><span id="MJXp-Span-280">c</span><span id="MJXp-Span-281">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-282">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-283">d</span><span id="MJXp-Span-284">y</span></span></span> as the second value.</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/grocery-2piecewise.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/grocery-2piecewise_hu5079e64f931df4f6662e1f8948e7ad4d_32519_297x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Now let’s learn about a function called <span><span id="MJXp-Span-285"><span id="MJXp-Span-286">mod</span></span></span>. The <span><span id="MJXp-Span-287"><span id="MJXp-Span-288">mod</span></span></span> function is short for “modulus”, and you can think of it as giving you the remainder of a division. For example, <span><span id="MJXp-Span-289"><span id="MJXp-Span-290">mod</span><span id="MJXp-Span-291"></span><span id="MJXp-Span-292">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-293">5</span><span id="MJXp-Span-294">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-295">3</span><span id="MJXp-Span-296">)</span><span id="MJXp-Span-297">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-298">2</span></span></span>, because 5 divided by 3 is 1 with a <em>remainder</em> of 2.</p>

<p><span><span id="MJXp-Span-299"><span id="MJXp-Span-300">mod</span></span></span> will be helpful to us because it will help us determine which component of a vector we’re looking at. As I mentioned before, we will be packing all our vertices into one big list, like <span><span id="MJXp-Span-301"><span id="MJXp-Span-302">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-303">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-304">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-305">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-306">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-307">z</span><span id="MJXp-Span-308">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-309">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-310">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-311">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-312">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-313">z</span><span id="MJXp-Span-314">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-315">.</span><span id="MJXp-Span-316">.</span><span id="MJXp-Span-317">.</span><span id="MJXp-Span-318">]</span></span></span>. Given the position <span><span id="MJXp-Span-319"><span id="MJXp-Span-320">n</span></span></span> of a particular number in this list, we can tell whether we’re looking at an x, y, or z by looking at the value of <span><span id="MJXp-Span-321"><span id="MJXp-Span-322">mod</span><span id="MJXp-Span-323"></span><span id="MJXp-Span-324">(</span><span id="MJXp-Span-325">n</span><span id="MJXp-Span-326">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-327">3</span><span id="MJXp-Span-328">)</span></span></span>.</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/mod-list.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/mod-list_hue6f0c9ff712360662ad4bfbbb33cd200_18121_522x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>As you can see, every x is a 1, every y is a 2, and every z is a 0. This repeating behavior will be exactly what we need to do different things for the different components of our vector, especially when paired with piecewise functions.</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/grocery-2mod.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/grocery-2mod_hu5079e64f931df4f6662e1f8948e7ad4d_33815_297x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Finally, there’s just one more enormous thing to learn about: sums.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100. If you were to write this out, it might look like:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-ints.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-ints_huc5532c48dfd7e3078210da9b323e0006_6096_338x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>This is not a very concise way of writing this! And it gets worse if you add up more complicated things:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-fracs.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-fracs_hu96d893b2943ffef8606570c324c9d24f_8162_359x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>You can see, though, that there are patterns in both examples. For cases like this, there is a special notation that can express them very concisely:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-notation.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-notation_hu99852aec3d005cef34a2ae680d3e9c2f_19643_468x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>You can read those out loud as “the sum as n goes from 1 to 100 of n” or “the sum as n goes from 1 to 100 of n over n plus 1”. The idea of this notation is to find a general way to write out each term of our sum, then to simply write down where we start and end. In these examples, we start at 1, end at 100, and have some simple way of writing down a general term in the sum (either <span><span id="MJXp-Span-329"><span id="MJXp-Span-330">n</span></span></span> or <span><span id="MJXp-Span-331"><span id="MJXp-Span-332"><span><span id="MJXp-Span-333">n</span></span><span><span><span><span></span></span><span><span><span id="MJXp-Span-334">n</span><span id="MJXp-Span-335">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-336">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.)</p>

<p>Let’s look at an interesting example: summing up all the numbers in a list. Say we have a list called <span><span id="MJXp-Span-337"><span id="MJXp-Span-338">l</span></span></span>. We can sum up all the numbers in <span><span id="MJXp-Span-339"><span id="MJXp-Span-340">l</span></span></span> by writing:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-simplelist.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-simplelist_hu2ad2ecedead3b42a7500266b6fdfe893_6241_109x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>To show why this works, let’s work through an example with the list [5, 10, 15, 20]:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-indexing.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-indexing_hufc5be80cdaae56ce01b993ac8fc0117b_23083_440x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>And finally, let’s look at one more small example. Without looking at the answer, can you tell what the result of this sum will be?</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-simplesame.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-simplesame_hu415fefb61a5b97803a717b9f05c97cb2_3761_76x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Since n starts at 3, and ends at 3, there is only one thing in our sum: 3. This is true no matter what number we have in our sum, and it’s a very important result for us: <strong>if the same number is on both the top and bottom of the sum, it’s like there was no sum at all.</strong></p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/grocery-2sums.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/grocery-2sums_hu5079e64f931df4f6662e1f8948e7ad4d_35029_297x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>You may want to take a break now and let all that sink in. It’s about to get a lot weirder - we’re going to put lists <em>inside</em> of sums.</p>

<h3 id="lists-in-sums-and-sums-in-lists">Lists in sums and sums in lists</h3>

<p>In general, whenever Desmos sees a list, it turns the whole result into a list. For example, as we’ve seen, <span><span id="MJXp-Span-341"><span id="MJXp-Span-342">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-343">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-344">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-345">2</span><span id="MJXp-Span-346">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-347">3</span><span id="MJXp-Span-348">]</span><span id="MJXp-Span-349">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-350">2</span><span id="MJXp-Span-351">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-352">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-353">3</span><span id="MJXp-Span-354">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-355">4</span><span id="MJXp-Span-356">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-357">5</span><span id="MJXp-Span-358">]</span></span></span>. If there are multiple lists involved, Desmos will try to match up the elements of those lists. For example, <span><span id="MJXp-Span-359"><span id="MJXp-Span-360">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-361">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-362">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-363">2</span><span id="MJXp-Span-364">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-365">3</span><span id="MJXp-Span-366">]</span><span id="MJXp-Span-367">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-368">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-369">10</span><span id="MJXp-Span-370">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-371">15</span><span id="MJXp-Span-372">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-373">20</span><span id="MJXp-Span-374">]</span><span id="MJXp-Span-375">=</span><span id="MJXp-Span-376">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-377">11</span><span id="MJXp-Span-378">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-379">17</span><span id="MJXp-Span-380">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-381">23</span><span id="MJXp-Span-382">]</span></span></span>. This is true no matter what you do with lists in Desmos - and that means it does crazy stuff with sums too.</p>

<p>For example, look what happens when we use a list on the bottom of our sum:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-listbottom.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-listbottom_hu3b2e31b296b579ae188c50552cee062e_24005_534x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>As you can see, Desmos again turns the whole result into a list, but this time turns it into a list of individual sums.</p>

<p>A similar thing happens when we use a list on the top of our sum:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-listtop.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-listtop_hu5e4c679be6e6fc3d91cd4aeda9a02377_22556_490x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>And if we use lists in both places, they will be matched up:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-listboth.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-listboth_huecadc94a0908998e1f4979583b5ea9e7_28423_616x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>We’ve seen that if the same number is on the top and bottom of the sum, it’s like there was no sum at all. Let’s look at a similar case, where we have the same <em>list</em> on the top and bottom.</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-listbothsame.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-listbothsame_hua1f1fbec008ea80b613255aa4073b37e_17987_403x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>You can see that this is just a list-based version of the previous case. Most of the sums go away because of the rule from the last section.</p>

<p>Let’s wrap up these examples with an even more complicated way of doing nothing, which happens to be very close to the technique we’ll use for matrix multiplication:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-listindices.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-listindices_hu6cd82bb494eac7a0d7ecb23e7ad67b5b_10721_205x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Let’s expand this and work through it. First, we have lists involved, so we can take care of that first:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-listindicesex1.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-listindicesex1_hu1e35b09d22a4de3895c0e0a924f8e72d_26216_626x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Now, notice that all these sums again have the same number on the top and bottom. They can disappear!</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-listindicesex2.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-listindicesex2_hu7a58453abbea2a930ebe71bbca80c05a_34662_626x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Finally, let’s think about what this list actually looks like. The first element of the list will be the first element of <span><span id="MJXp-Span-383"><span id="MJXp-Span-384">l</span></span></span>. The second element of the list will be the second element of <span><span id="MJXp-Span-385"><span id="MJXp-Span-386">l</span></span></span>. This continues all the way to the end of the list. That means our result list is actually just <span><span id="MJXp-Span-387"><span id="MJXp-Span-388">l</span></span></span>!</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-listindicesex3.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-listindicesex3_huc2c09bc5f83793b62ee21d7111ed10c7_57405_626x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>The nice thing about this technique is that it is very flexible. For example, just by putting 2 in front of <span><span id="MJXp-Span-389"><span id="MJXp-Span-390">l</span><span id="MJXp-Span-391">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-392">n</span><span id="MJXp-Span-393">]</span></span></span>, we can double all the elements of <span><span id="MJXp-Span-394"><span id="MJXp-Span-395">l</span></span></span>:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-listdouble.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-listdouble_hu0e2b3de223807ae2a8a14e940f8caea8_44625_602x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>The real kicker, though, is that because we do all this business with <span><span id="MJXp-Span-396"><span id="MJXp-Span-397">l</span><span id="MJXp-Span-398">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-399">n</span><span id="MJXp-Span-400">]</span></span></span>, this technique allows us to refer to other elements in the list. For example, we can shift all the elements in the list over by 1:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/sum-listshift.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/sum-listshift_hu8757e3bb03c8ddba1c08296827d419b7_41915_659x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>(This screws up the last element in the list, but whatever.)</p>

<p>What we’re doing no longer looks much like a sum at all. But what we have is something much more helpful: a way to transform a list into any other list. This is the final piece we need to implement this multiplication we’ve been working toward.</p>

<h3 id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing it all together</h3>

<p>Let’s recap what know:</p>

<ul>
<li>We start with <span><span id="MJXp-Span-401"><span id="MJXp-Span-402">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-403"><span id="MJXp-Span-404">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-405">1</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-406">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-407"><span id="MJXp-Span-408">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-409">1</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-410">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-411"><span id="MJXp-Span-412">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-413">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-414">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-415"><span id="MJXp-Span-416">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-417">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-418">]</span></span></span> and end with <span><span id="MJXp-Span-419"><span id="MJXp-Span-420">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-421">a</span><span id="MJXp-Span-422"><span id="MJXp-Span-423">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-424">1</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-425">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-426">b</span><span id="MJXp-Span-427"><span id="MJXp-Span-428">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-429">1</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-430">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-431">c</span><span id="MJXp-Span-432"><span id="MJXp-Span-433">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-434">1</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-435">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-436">d</span><span id="MJXp-Span-437"><span id="MJXp-Span-438">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-439">1</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-440">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-441">a</span><span id="MJXp-Span-442"><span id="MJXp-Span-443">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-444">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-445">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-446">b</span><span id="MJXp-Span-447"><span id="MJXp-Span-448">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-449">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-450">,</span><span id="MJXp-Span-451">c</span><span id="MJXp-Span-452"><span id="MJXp-Span-453">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-454">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-455">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-456">d</span><span id="MJXp-Span-457"><span id="MJXp-Span-458">y</span><span id="MJXp-Span-459">2</span></span><span id="MJXp-Span-460">]</span></span></span>. This means each <span><span id="MJXp-Span-461"><span id="MJXp-Span-462">x</span></span></span> turns into <span><span id="MJXp-Span-463"><span id="MJXp-Span-464">a</span><span id="MJXp-Span-465">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-466">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-467">b</span><span id="MJXp-Span-468">y</span></span></span> and each <span><span id="MJXp-Span-469"><span id="MJXp-Span-470">y</span></span></span> turns into <span><span id="MJXp-Span-471"><span id="MJXp-Span-472">c</span><span id="MJXp-Span-473">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-474">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-475">d</span><span id="MJXp-Span-476">y</span></span></span>.</li>
<li>We know piecewise functions can help us choose different values based on some condition.</li>
<li>We know the <span><span id="MJXp-Span-477"><span id="MJXp-Span-478">mod</span></span></span> function can help us tell which component of the vector we’re looking at.</li>
<li>We know we can use sums to transform lists into basically any other list.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all that in mind, I present to you: The Master Formula (2D Edition).</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/eq-master2d.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/eq-master2d_hu372128258ffc8b5140f1b7052b6e571f_64709_792x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>Let’s break down why this works. The <span><span id="MJXp-Span-479"><span id="MJXp-Span-480">mod</span></span></span> function is used to tell us whether we’re looking at an x or a y. In our [x, y, x, y, …] example, the odd-numbered elements are x’s, and the even-numbered elements are y’s. You might notice that the first case looks something like <span><span id="MJXp-Span-481"><span id="MJXp-Span-482">a</span><span id="MJXp-Span-483">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-484">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-485">b</span><span id="MJXp-Span-486">y</span></span></span> and the second case looks something like <span><span id="MJXp-Span-487"><span id="MJXp-Span-488">c</span><span id="MJXp-Span-489">x</span><span id="MJXp-Span-490">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-491">d</span><span id="MJXp-Span-492">y</span></span></span>, but with references to <span><span id="MJXp-Span-493"><span id="MJXp-Span-494">l</span></span></span> instead. The reason this works is because when we’re looking at an x, <span><span id="MJXp-Span-495"><span id="MJXp-Span-496">l</span><span id="MJXp-Span-497">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-498">n</span><span id="MJXp-Span-499">]</span></span></span> is the x and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-500"><span id="MJXp-Span-501">l</span><span id="MJXp-Span-502">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-503">n</span><span id="MJXp-Span-504">+</span><span id="MJXp-Span-505">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-506">]</span></span></span>, the next element in the list, is the y. Similarly, when we’re looking at a y, <span><span id="MJXp-Span-507"><span id="MJXp-Span-508">l</span><span id="MJXp-Span-509">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-510">n</span><span id="MJXp-Span-511">]</span></span></span> refers to the y, and <span><span id="MJXp-Span-512"><span id="MJXp-Span-513">l</span><span id="MJXp-Span-514">[</span><span id="MJXp-Span-515">n</span><span id="MJXp-Span-516">−</span><span id="MJXp-Span-517">1</span><span id="MJXp-Span-518">]</span></span></span>, the element before it in the list, is the x.</p>

<p>We can easily extend this up to the four dimensions we need, but it’s gonna get big. Buckle up:</p>





<div>
    <div>
        <p><img srcset="/desmos/images/eq-master4d.png 2x" src="https://bvisness.me/desmos/images/eq-master4d_hu5c26df125f635a802aaa9d6476e833cb_214061_795x0_resize_box_2.png">
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>This may be big. It may be crazy. It may be a complete abuse of the features Desmos has provided. But the important thing is that we’ve finally come up with a way to do the math we need.</p>

<p>It’s time to bring it home.</p>

<h3 id="the-home-stretch">The home stretch</h3>

<p>The master formula can be easily adapted to do any transformation we want. Rotation, transformation, projection - we pretty much just do all our transformations in order and plot the result. The final product has some other functions to help build our big list of points, and a bunch of things to draw the controls on the screen, but the meat of it is all in those crazy sums that took me so long to explain.</p>

<p>At this point, <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ersamusmyo">the Desmos</a> pretty much speaks for itself.</p>

<p>This renderer may not be pretty. It may not have any lighting or shading. It may even show things behind the camera as upside down. But it’s a testament to the power of Desmos that it can support this kind of project at all. Seeing this thing in action makes me feel like there’s nothing Desmos can’t do - so who knows? Maybe in a year’s time I’ll have made an entire game in here.</p>
