                <h2>Is slow software delivery keeping you up at night?</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>You’re the manager of a .NET Software Project team. You have a software team with a deadline, 
                        and you’re not sure why the pace of software delivery seems slower than you’re expecting</li>
                      <li>Stakeholders need changes made to the system and because of decisions made early in the project, the system is harder to change than you need it to be</li>
                      <li>Your stakeholders ask you when they’ll be able to give feedback on features, and you have to tell them “Soon”, instead of “Right now”</li>
                      <li>Your team fights bugs that crop up as deadlines get closer, and deadlines are in jeopardy</li>
                      <li>For you, “Code Freeze” is a phrase you know all to well as the most viable way to de-risk delivery of your software project, to not let bugs get in too close to the release date</li>
                    </ul>
                        <p><strong>It doesn’t have to be this way.</strong></p>
                    <div><p>
                      You should be able to make changes to the system when you need to, without worrying about bugs cropping up.
                      </p><p>
                      You should be able to show stakeholders progress within the first sprint and show progress you can demonstrate every sprint. No more "We did a lot of backend work, but have nothing to show".
                    </p></div>
                    <p>
                      You should be able to have the confidence in software delivery that you're building what your stakeholders need and asked for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The week before the project deadline shouldn't need to hectic. For you and your team, it should be like any other week.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Software Development as we practice it is fundamentally broken. It relies too much on
                      the individual skill of the developer and not enough on creating a process that all developers -- regardless of their skill level, can follow. It's like we're building houses by asking someone who's built a house to help us, without a guide to follow.
                      That's what causes the problems you're seeing, and that's why software projects over-budget, over-time and with more bugs than our stakeholders can tolerate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Test Driven Development (TDD) can help you solve these problems, but it requires your team to change how they build software.  TDD instills a process that, along with complementary patterns and practices, allows your team to build better software, faster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I've seen and personally built software <em>twice</em> as fast using Test Driven Development, and I can help you and your team double your productivity.
