</p><p>In August 2017, Salonen, a customer of Cryptopay, emailed their customer services team to ask for a new password. They refused, given that it was against the company's privacy policy.</p><p>A fair point, as it's never a good idea to send a new password in an email. A password-reset link is safer all round, although it's not clear if Cryptopay offered this option to Salonen.</p></div></div></div></div>
