                        <p>Welcome to Microsoft Build 2020! This all-new 48-hour digital experience is designed to help you and other developers around the world come together to solve challenges, share knowledge, and stay connected. Here we’ll cover some of our latest innovations in developer tools and cloud platform technologies—to help you code, collaborate, and ship your apps from anywhere, so you can support the changing needs of your business and continue to deliver the quality experiences that your customers expect.</p>

<p>So how do you overcome the challenges of today and remain productive as developers? Thankfully, in today’s digital world there are tools to help you work remotely and be as productive as ever: with Azure as your trusted cloud platform and cloud-powered developer tools with Visual Studio and GitHub.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>Developers often spend endless hours configuring dev machines for new projects: cloning source code, installing runtimes, setting up linters and debuggers, configuring extensions—just to do it all again for the next project, the next bug, or the next code review. The challenge is even more prevalent in times of remote work, where you might not have access to your preferred development machine. <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/" target="_blank" data-event="page-clicked-link" data-bi-id="page-clicked-link" data-bi-an="undefined" data-bi-tn="undefined">Visual Studio Codespaces</a>, available in preview, enables you to create a cloud-hosted development environment that’s ready to code, in seconds. You can access it from Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio and it also includes a full web-based editor you can use to edit, run, and debug your applications from any device. We recently announced that <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank" data-event="page-clicked-link" data-bi-id="page-clicked-link" data-bi-an="undefined" data-bi-tn="undefined">Codespaces is coming to GitHub</a> in preview, so you can also easily code from any repo.</p>

<p>With over 50 million developers, GitHub is the place where developers code <i>together</i>. We continue to innovate to ensure collaboration is seamless at every stage of the software development lifecycle. For example, you may find yourself needing to brainstorm feature ideas, help new users get their bearings, and collaborate on best ways to use the software.&nbsp; GitHub Discussions recently announced at GitHub Satellite helps you do just that and is in public beta. Learn more about the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/" target="_blank" data-event="page-clicked-link" data-bi-id="page-clicked-link" data-bi-an="undefined" data-bi-tn="undefined">latest GitHub innovations</a> to help you collaborate with your team members.</p>

<h2>Ship</h2>

<p>Over the past six months, we’ve published more than 30 <a href="https://aka.ms/GitHubActionsforAzureDocs" target="_blank" data-event="page-clicked-link" data-bi-id="page-clicked-link" data-bi-an="undefined" data-bi-tn="undefined">GitHub Actions for Azure</a> to help you create workflows to build, test, package, release and deploy to multiple Azure services, from web applications to serverless functions to Kubernetes. We heard from you that it can be difficult to craft CI/CD pipelines by editing a bunch of YAMLs and you spend a considerable time setting up and switching between different discrete tools. We are pleased to announce that <a href="https://aka.ms/GitHubActionsforAzureDocs" target="_blank" data-event="page-clicked-link" data-bi-id="page-clicked-link" data-bi-an="undefined" data-bi-tn="undefined">GitHub Actions for Azure</a> are now integrated into Visual Studio Code, Azure CLI and the Azure Portal simplifying the experience of deploying to Azure from your preferred entry points. Download the new <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-deploy-azure.azure-deploy" target="_blank" data-event="page-clicked-link" data-bi-id="page-clicked-link" data-bi-an="undefined" data-bi-tn="undefined">Visual Studio Code extension</a> or install the <a href="https://aka.ms/install-aks-cli-extension" target="_blank" data-event="page-clicked-link" data-bi-id="page-clicked-link" data-bi-an="undefined" data-bi-tn="undefined">Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) extension</a> for GitHub Actions for Azure.</p>

<p>Security is also top of mind when releasing code into production. At GitHub Satellite, we announced cloud betas of code scanning and secret scanning to help developers consume and ship code safely. With code scanning enabled in GitHub, every “Git push” is scanned for new security concerns using the world’s most advanced semantic analysis engine, <a href="https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql" target="_blank" data-event="page-clicked-link" data-bi-id="page-clicked-link" data-bi-an="undefined" data-bi-tn="undefined">CodeQL</a>. Secrets scanning is now available for private repositories. This feature watches private repositories for known secret formats and immediately notifies developers when they are found. Developers can now identify, remediate, and prevent vulnerabilities in source code before they are deployed into production.</p>
