The first pass issues for this don't go to the article level issues. Those are added as we break down major sections for more detailed work. Rather, initial issues (and tasks) are to propose a new tree of articles for each smaller section.</p>

<li>Identify issues that arise when examples are run interactively by using try.dot.net.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project consists of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Articles for evaluation.</strong> A list of articles that are candidates for try.dot.net. Community members are welcome to open issues or add items with links to articles they believe could benefit from interactivity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Articles made interactive.</strong> Issues that were evaluated and found to benefit from interactivity and that now have interactive examples.</li>
<li>
<strong>Issues with interactive examples.</strong> This column includes issues that have arisen in running code interactively in the try.dot.net environment. In these cases, try.dot.net produces a result different from that on a user's local system. The issues themselves should be opened in the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/try/issues">dotnet/try</a> repo.</li>
<li>
<strong>Resolved issues.</strong> This column includes issues with interactive examples that have been resolved.</li>

    <div data-filter-value="Consolidate the C# Language Reference">

      

      <div>
          <p>The initial discussion is in #2840.</p>
<p>There are several related goals to this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Minimize redundant information. Much of the language reference is duplicated in the spec. They have drifted over time.</li>
<li>Put related features on the same page. That helps readers find alternatives to the syntax they were searching.</li>
<li>Optimize for search on unfamiliar tokens. Readers search when they see unfamiliar syntax. We want them to quickly find what those tokens mean, and learn more quickly.</li>
<li>Consolidate the amount of content.</li>
</ol>
<p>This project will make those changes in several steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Publish the language spec proposals for features released after C# 6.0 (draft spec available)</li>
<li>Create a new "Abridged Language Reference" section that consolidates much of the existing content and refers readers interested in more details to one or more sections of the spec or proposals.</li>
<li>For each sub-section in the "Abridged Language Reference" do the following:
<ol>
<li>Create the new articles</li>
<li>Search for existing issues on content being migrated and consolidated. This is a good opportunity to fix those.</li>
<li>Redirect existing content to the new articles.</li>
<li>Remove old articles.</li>
<li>Update all links in the .NET Content</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The sub-sections are:</p>
<ul>
<li>builtin types</li>
<li>operators
<ul>
<li>primary operators</li>
<li>unary operators</li>
<li>arithmetic operators</li>
<li>relational and equality operators</li>
<li>type testing and assignment</li>
<li>logical operators</li>
<li>other operators and special tokens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defining types, members and variables
<ul>
<li>declaring types</li>
<li>declaring members</li>
<li>controlling access</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Statements
<ul>
<li>selection and jump statements</li>
<li>iteration statements</li>
<li>exception statements</li>
<li>other statements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LINQ query expressions</li>
<li>Conversions</li>
<li>Attributes</li>
<li>Unsafe code</li>
<li>Documentation comments</li>
<li>Compiler options</li>
</ul>
<p>One section require more detail: The compiler error and warning messages.  This is covered in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/docs/projects/44">https://github.com/dotnet/docs/projects/44</a>  There are three main changes for that section:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove entries from the TOC. These articles should be found via search for specific error codes or messages.</li>
<li>Put all content in the same folder (they are currently in two locations)</li>
<li>Add missing warnings and errors (most starting with Version 6)</li>
</ol>

<li>Use containers to install and run .NET Core without affecting your system.</li>

          <p>There are a number of issues around articles on asynchronous programming using <code>async</code>, <code>await</code>, <code>System.Threading.Tasks</code> types. There are also similar numbers of issues on the Task Parallel Library, PLINQ and related concepts. Finally, there is confusion between the terms "asynchronous programming", "multi-threaded programming" and "parallel program execution".</p>

      <div>
          <p>This project lists outstanding tasks and work items for which we would appreciate community contributions. The items are grouped into three categories. Depending on your interests, your level of familiarity with GitHub, and your level of comfort with creating independent content, you can choose from the following three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintenance</strong>. These work items involve such things as correcting broken links, correcting spelling or stylistic errors, or modifying the formatting of content to improve the overall appearance of the documentation on docs.microsoft.com.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content updates</strong>. Parts of our massive documentation set have become stale and are in need of updating. Some topics don't do a good job of addressing the issues that developers face when using a technology and require revision and refocusing. Migration to a new publishing platform has created duplication and, in some cases, triplication of largely identical topics that needs to be addressed through a process of consolidation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authoring new content</strong>. Every documentation set has gaps. We welcome community contributions to address those gaps. We've identified some of the topics and topic areas for which we would like to see content, but the list is not exhaustive. You may want to contribute a topic in a technology area about which you feel passionate that isn't on the list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these work items are available. Two additional columns contain items for which work either has begun or has been completed.</p>
<p>If you're interested in helping to migrate existing .NET Framework code found on <a href="https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/" rel="nofollow">Code Gallery</a> to .NET code stored on <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/samples">GitHub</a> and downloadable using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browser" rel="nofollow">Sample Browser</a>, see the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/docs/projects/88">Code Gallery Migration</a> project.</p>
