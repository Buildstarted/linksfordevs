                <h3>Another day, another dystopian headline. You are living in the age of constant surveillance - and your right to privacy is under constant attack.</h3>
                <p>IVPN provides the best first step for protecting your privacy. Once you are connected, your internet traffic is encrypted and therefore hidden from ISPs and mobile operators, while our AntiTracker blocks all ads and web trackers.</p>
                <p>We’re not your regular VPN service. We self-host all our servers to ensure our customers' privacy. We strongly oppose misleading affiliate schemes and advertising that uses trackers. Unlike many other VPN services, we are run by a transparent team of privacy activists, driven by principles, not profit.</p>

            <p>"Forget having nothing to hide. The internet activity of every human being has become a hot commodity. Our data is being churned into an industry that’s worth more than oil.

                <ul>
                    <li>“I've tried many VPNs which made all sorts of (false) claims about speed and security. However,
                        from the first moment I kicked off my trial period I fell in love with IVPN. No other service
                        even compares.”<span>— Anonymous</span></li>
                    <li>“I was pleasantly surprised by the ease with which I could use this technology. I feel more
                        secure online, although I realise there is no such thing as
                        100%, IVPN feels pretty close!”<span>— Anonymous</span></li>
                    <li>“Fast, reliable, secure. No other VPN service promises to relocate to another jurisdiction
                        rather than sell you out to an adversary.”<span>— Anonymous</span></li>
                    <li>“IVPN has truly exceeded my initial expectations of it, I can't imagine ever switching away from
                        it.”<span>— Matthew Woodward</span></li>
                    <li>“I would truly like to thank IVPN for delivering such an innovative service as it has been a
                        real treat to use during busy work days. You may pay a bit more for the service, but the adage 'You get what you pay for', reigns supreme.”<span>— Anonymous</span></li>

                <div>
                    <p>Do you guarantee anonymity?</p>
                    <p>No, true anonymity is not guaranteed using a VPN. Any VPN service promising anonymity is negligent or misleading its customers. Using IVPN with AntiTracker enabled is a significant step in preserving your privacy online – further privacy challenges are addressed in our
                        <a href="https://www.ivpn.net/blog/privacy-guides">privacy guides</a>.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>What protocols do you use?</p>
                    <p>We use OpenVPN by default with AES-256 encryption with 4096-bit RSA keys. All our apps come with the revolutionary WireGuard protocol built in for testing, which enables significantly faster connection speeds and performance than other solutions.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                
                <div>
                    <p>I can host my own VPN. Why is this better?</p>
                    <p>Hosting your own VPN might be good for WiFi security, but it does not sufficiently protect your privacy. Your IP address is unique and can be tied to your personal identity, since you have to own or rent the server required. By using IVPN, your IP address is mixed in with a large pool of other users and so websites and other services only see the IP address of our servers.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                
                <div>
                    <p>How does AntiTracker work?</p>
                    <p>AntiTracker blocks requests on the DNS level from entities that try to track you across the web and in apps you use: adware, malware, social networks, data brokers and so on. We use a publicly available and constantly updated list to ensure accurate blocking.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Where are your servers located?</p>
                    <p>We have 78 servers in 45 locations. See our
                        <a href="https://www.ivpn.net/server-locations">servers page</a> for a detailed list.</p>
