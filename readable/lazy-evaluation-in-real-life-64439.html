    <p>There are so many great ideas in engineering we can take home and
 apply to our own lives.  Today I will talk about one of them: lazy
 evaluation.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="the-concept">The Concept</h3>

<p>Lazy evaluation is simple to state: when given a task, you don’t start
doing it right away.  Instead, you keep accumulating tasks until you
see an end-goal.  At that point, you work backwards to do just enough
work.</p>

<p>It’s simple, but it’s counter-intuitive.  You have to wrestle with it
a bit to understand it.  Let me give an example from Spark, which is
the poster-child of lazy evaluation strategies.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to select some rows in a table, filter based on a
condition, then save as a table.  In Spark, you could say:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>"*"</span><span>).</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>"foo &gt; 50"</span><span>).</span><span>saveAsTable</span><span>(</span><span>"finalTable"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s break it down.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Note the first function call.  When Spark sees <code>df.select("*")</code>, does
it fetch everything from the table?  No!  It only saves a note, and
continues to look for an end-goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You then specify a condition to filter upon: still not an end goal,
so it adds to its notes and continues to wait.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, it sees an output call, the <code>saveAsTable()</code>.  Ah, here comes
the end-goal.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Spark now works <em>backward</em>: it sees a filter.  Before that, it sees a
<code>select("*")</code>.  It can push the condition <em>backwards</em> to the select,
so that rows that do not match can be discarded immediately at read
time.  Quite efficient.</p>

<p>Now imagine if Spark worked like traditional eager programs.  You
would run out of memory right at the <code>select("*")</code> step, and the job
would fail.</p>

<h3 id="in-real-life">In real life</h3>

<p>Lazy evaluation is a very powerful idea.  It gives you a framework to
know what to do, in the face of unlimited information: It says, you
should not be eager.</p>

<p>We live in an age where data is infinite.  There is a multitude of
courses, books, websites on any important topic, and there are new
things coming out every day.  You cannot eagerly learn everything out
there.  There’s not enough time, and even if you did, as an individual
you’re a weak learner.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Instead, the lazy evaluation recipe is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You should ask yourself, <em>what is your end goal?</em> What do you need
to know or do, based on that end-goal, and what can you stop doing?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out of all the things you could be doing, you should select (or at
least prioritize) those that will take you <em>closer</em> to your end-goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, you should minimize or eliminate tasks that do not lead to
your end goal, or at least you should be aware that they could be
wasted effort.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, it’s not always possible to know what can or cannot lead
into the output.  But it’s important to keep this in our mind, so that
we can limit the damage if we stray from the path, by stopping such
work after a pre-determined point in time.</p>

<h3 id="two-examples">Two Examples</h3>

<p>This situation frequently happens during a career move.  Interviews
are daunting because they may choose to ask anything, so you should be
prepared for everything, right?  And also learn all the new things
since you left school?</p>

<p>Instead, a different strategy is to look at job descriptions for the
role or companies you would like to go to.  You build a list of skills
you need to know, and continue to work backward on acquiring those
skills from the best possible resource in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>A similar situation can occur in research-oriented projects, where it
is easy to lose track of the deliverable in the name of research or
trying new ideas.  Especially in machine learning, a complex model
with say 78% accuracy is not that much better than a simpler model with
75% accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="not-a-new-idea">Not a New Idea</h3>

<p>The idea of lazy evaluation is not new.  Relational databases have
been building query plans since 1980s.  The concept is part of the
functional programming repertoire since 1970.  Operating systems do
not load the entire program into memory: they load the relevant pages
as your program executes, a concept known as lazy loading.</p>

<p>Amazingly for a technical idea, lazy evaluation seems to be well-known
in self help literature: Steven Covey said in his famous <em>Seven
Habits</em> book, “Begin with the end in mind”.  One would hope he had an
intuition about lazy evaluation.</p>

<p>Lazy evaluation is one of those flywheel ideas.  When you apply it, it
should create less wasted work.  This should create more time, and in
this time, you probably apply the same idea to more projects and
deliver them well.  This is the flywheel.</p>

<p>In any case, don’t attempt to do a <code>select("*")</code> on an infinite
knowledgebase.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p><small><sup>1</sup> This is a concept in machine learning, where a
bunch of different models can often do better than any single model.
It is known as an ensemble.  I like to think of Kaggle.com as an
ensemble of humans, often coming up with ensembles of learning
models.</small></p>
