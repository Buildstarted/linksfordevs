			<center>a real-time vector graphics library for Unity by <a href="https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer/">Freya HolmÃ©r</a></center><br>
			<center>After Shader Forge, I wanted to make something different.<br>It has bothered me for a long time that for some reason, html5 canvas is better at drawing primitives than Unity.<br>I really wanted something to help us make html5 canvas style crisp lines, discs, polylines and, well, Shapes!</center><br>
			<center>so, here we are~</center>
			<table><tbody><tr><td><div><div><p><img src="https://acegikmo.com/shapes/images/naive-lines-comparison.png"></p></div></div></td><td><h3>Local Anti-Aliasing</h3>			Naive implementations of lines are often locked to 1 pixel in width, without any proper anti-aliasing. Shapes has built-in <a href="#anti-aliasing">local anti-aliasing</a>, so even if your project doesn't have any kind of AA, Shapes will still draw lines smooth as heck~
			</td></tr></tbody></table>
			<table><tbody><tr><td><div><div><p><img src="https://acegikmo.com/shapes/images/polyline-joins.png"></p></div></div></td><td><h3>Polylines</h3>			<a href="#shape-polyline">Polylines</a> with configurable Round, Miter &amp; Bevel joins</td></tr>
			</tbody></table>			
						
						
			<table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://acegikmo.com/shapes/images/immediate-mode-anim.gif"></td><td><h3>Immediate-Mode API</h3>			In addition to the components, Shapes has an <a href="#immediate-mode">Immediate-Mode API</a> for code-based drawing, including scene view drawing support for cleaner looking debugging and gizmos</td></tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<h4>Limitations</h4>
			<table>
					<tbody><tr><td>â€¢ No SVG support, Shapes is not designed to be an SVG asset importer/exporter</td></tr>
					<tr><td>â€¢ No ECS support, because it seems to change every week and I barely know how it works yet</td></tr>
					<tr><td>â€¢ No <a href="#ui">UI support</a> in overlay mode, though you can use camera-based or world-space UI to work around it</td></tr>
					<tr><td>â€¢ No URP/HDRP support, at least not officially, but it does work! <a href="https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer/status/1262692292030316544">kinda~</a></td></tr>

					<tr><td>â€¢ No arbitrary polygon filling yet! I really want to do this though, so, coming soon!</td></tr>
					<tr><td>â€¢ Applying custom shaders is currently difficult unless you know how to code shaders, since every shape has a very specialized shader</td></tr>
			</tbody></table>

			<h4 id="license">License</h4><p>
			Legal TLDR: Treat Shapes like a commercial product you license through my Patreon, on a pay-what-you-want-but-at-least $10 basis, with further support very much encouraged, but not required for those who can't~</p><table>
					<tbody><tr><td>ðŸ’” Shapes is <i>not</i> open source, but if my patreon support grows substantially, it would likely open source under the MIT license</td></tr>
					<tr><td>ðŸ’” You may not sell, publish or distribute the source code or any modifications thereof in any circumstance</td></tr>
					<tr><td>ðŸ’” You may not use the code in open-source projects or asset store plugins</td></tr>
					<tr><td>ðŸ’” You may not port the source code to other engines and release it as your own, that's super rude :c</td></tr>
					<tr><td>ðŸ’š You may use Shapes in projects developed in Unity, both commercial and non-commercial</td></tr>
					<tr><td>ðŸ’š You technically don't have to keep up a subscription on my Patreon beyond the first $10, partially because I literally can't enforce it, but mostly because I think, if you are a single individual who don't have a lot of money, it's totally understandable if you can't do it. However, if you can afford to support further, especially if you are a studio, please consider supporting more than bare minimum, and consider how much engineering time you're saving. I would very very much appreciate it, as this is my main source of income!</td></tr>
					<tr><td>ðŸ’š If your business entity can't license Shapes through Patreon for legal reasons, contact me at acegikmo@gmail.com</td></tr>
					<tr><td>ðŸ’š It's not required but, it'd be really nice if you could credit me for Shapes in your project!</td></tr>
					<tr><td>ðŸ’š Finally - please tag me (<a href="https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer/">@FreyaHolmer</a>) if you share your work on twitter - I'd love to see all the cool stuff you create!! </td></tr>

Lines are defined by a </p><propname>Start</propname><p> point and an </p><propname>End</propname><p> point, along with a configurable </p><propname>Thickness</propname><p>. As with many other shapes, you can set </p><propname>Thickness Space</propname><p> to various <a href="#thickness-units">units</a>, so you can specify </p><propname>Thickness</propname><p> in either <a href="#thickness-units">meters, pixels or noots</a>.</p><h4>Geometry</h4>
<propname>Flat 2D</propname><p> lines are flat on the local space XY plane, ignoring Z. This is useful for making lines that are locked to a plane, such as in 2D games, or for a 2D surface in a 3D world such as a screen or minimap</p><propname>Billboard</propname><p> lines are positioned in 3D space, still using a quad mesh, always trying to face the camera. Useful for a cheap way of drawing 3D lines without using much geometry</p><propname>Volumetric 3D</propname><p> lines are using actual polygons to render a 3D line with the given </p><propname>Thickness</propname><br>

<p>Polyline</p><div><p><img src="https://acegikmo.com/shapes/images/icon-polyline.png"></p><div><p>
Polylines describe a line drawn along a path made of multiple points. A </p><propname>Closed</propname><p> polyline means it's cyclical, its ends are connected. A non-</p><propname>Closed</propname><p> path on the other hand has two endpoints. The </p><propname>Polyline Points</propname><p> use both a global </p><propname>Color</propname><p>, as well as per-point colors, these are multiplied together! You can think of the color as a tint color.<br>
Just like the lines, you can set </p><propname>Thickness</propname><p> and </p><propname>Thickness Space</propname><p> to various <a href="#thickness-units">units</a>, scaled by the per-point thickness.</p><h4>Joins</h4>

The Disc is a versatile shape encapsulating various </p><propname>Disc Types</propname><p>, including pie, ring and arc.<br>
When in ring or arc mode, </p><propname>Radius</propname><p> is not the distance to the outer edge, but rather distance to the center of a cross section of the ring. This is so that you can specify </p><propname>Thickness</propname><p> and </p><propname>Radius</propname><p> in separate units, with predictable results.<br> When drawing arcs or pies, you specify a </p><propname>Start Angle</propname><p> and an </p><propname>End Angle</propname><p>.

			<msp>Shapes.Draw</msp><p> is the main class for immediate mode drawing, and has two core parts:</p><ul>
<li>Drawing functions like <msp>Draw.Line, Draw.Disc, Draw.Torus</msp>...<br></li>
<li>Static global properties for subsequent <msp>Draw.X</msp> calls, such as <msp>Draw.Color, Draw.LineThickness, Draw.BlendMode</msp>...<br></li>
</ul><p>


For example, drawing the world xyz basis vectors at the origin, with 4px wide lines using 3D geometry, in OnDrawGizmos:</p><pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>OnDrawGizmos</span>(<span></span>)</span>{
	
	<span>Draw</span>.LineGeometry = LineGeometry.Volumetric3D;
	<span>Draw</span>.LineThicknessSpace = ThicknessSpace.Pixels;
	<span>Draw</span>.LineThickness = <span>4</span>; 

	
	<span>Draw</span>.Line( Vector3.zero, Vector3.right,   Color.red   );
	<span>Draw</span>.Line( Vector3.zero, Vector3.up,      Color.green );
	<span>Draw</span>.Line( Vector3.zero, Vector3.forward, Color.blue  );
}</code></pre><p>
In this case, we used global properties for many of the line properties, but we set color per-line, overriding the global </p><msp>Draw.Color</msp><p>

You <i>can</i> override all properties in the draw functions too, but, do note that the core draw functions have *many* parameters, most of which you generally don't want to set on a per-call basis. For example, Draw.Line's core draw function has 12 parameters.</p><p>

You can find all the global properties in </p><msp>DrawState.cs</msp><p>, the core drawing functions for all immediate mode shapes in </p><msp>Draw.cs</msp><p>, and all the shorthands/overloads of the drawing functions in the, uh, incredibly dense </p><msp>DrawOverloads.cs</msp><h4>Drawing Contexts</h4><p>
Drawing in immediate mode with Shapes is equivalent to using <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.SetPass.html">Material.SetPass</a> and <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Graphics.DrawMeshNow.html">Graphics.DrawMeshNow</a>. This means that the timing and the context in which you draw matters a lot. Here are a few places you can call immediate mode drawing:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnPostRender.html">MonoBehaviour.OnPostRender</a>, useful for drawing from scripts attached to your camera</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera.OnPostRender.html">Camera.onPostRender</a>, static event to subscribe to, receiving <i>all</i> camera OnPostRender callbacks, to ensure it's being drawn regardless of what camera is being used</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnDrawGizmos.html">MonoBehaviour.OnDrawGizmos</a>, as shown above, useful for editor gizmos</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Polylines</h4><p>
Polylines can be drawn in several ways. The first and most flexible one is to create a temporary </p><msp>PolylinePath</msp><p>, then speficy its points, and finally drawing it. This method will automatically dispose of mesh data at the end of its scope, since it's in a </p><msp>using</msp><p> block

</p><pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>OnPostRender</span>(<span></span>)</span>{
	using( var p = <span>new</span> PolylinePath() ){
		p.AddPoint( <span>-1</span>, <span>-1</span> );
		p.AddPoint( <span>-1</span>,  <span>1</span> );
		p.AddPoint(  <span>1</span>,  <span>1</span> );
		p.AddPoint(  <span>1</span>, <span>-1</span> );
		<span>Draw</span>.Polyline( p, closed:true, thickness:<span>0.1f</span>, Color.red ); 
	} 
}</code></pre><p>

The above code will recreate the polyline mesh every time you draw it. If you instead want a persistent polyline that you can modify instead of recreate all the time, you can create a PolylinePath in, say, </p><msp>Awake</msp><p>, and then, importantly, dispose it when you're done with it, usually in </p><msp>OnDestroy</msp><p> or </p><msp>OnDisable</msp><p>. This ensures any mesh data is cleaned up properly

</p><pre><code>PolylinePath p;
<span><span>void</span> <span>Awake</span>(<span></span>)</span>{
	p = <span>new</span> PolylinePath();
	p.AddPoint( <span>-1</span>, <span>-1</span> );
	p.AddPoint( <span>-1</span>,  <span>1</span> );
	p.AddPoint(  <span>1</span>,  <span>1</span> );
	p.AddPoint(  <span>1</span>, <span>-1</span> );
} 
<span><span>void</span> <span>OnPostRender</span>(<span></span>)</span> =&gt; <span>Draw</span>.Polyline( p, closed:true, thickness:<span>0.1f</span>, Color.red ); 
<span><span>void</span> <span>OnDestroy</span>(<span></span>)</span> =&gt; p.Dispose(); </code></pre>
			<p>			Shapes will look best across the board when your project is using some form of anti-aliasing. 8xMSAA is recommended! Some shapes however, also have built-in local anti-aliasing, which means that they will have smooth edges even when your project has no AA method enabled.

			</p><h4>Local Anti-Aliasing</h4><p>
			Local anti-aliasing or LAA, is when shapes themselves have built-in AA, even when your project/camera isn't using anti-aliasing as a whole. LAA is available for most 2D shapes when using a non-opaque blending mode, current exceptions are:</p><lt>
				<li>Quads &amp; Triangles</li>
				<li>Rectangle (partial support)</li>
				<li>Discs sometimes get minor artifacts on the polygon bounds</li>
			</lt>
			<p>
			You can disable or change the quality of local anti-aliasing with </p><msp>LOCAL_ANTI_ALIASING_QUALITY</msp><p> in </p><msp>Shapes Config.cginc</msp><br>


			<div><div><p><img src="https://acegikmo.com/shapes/images/aa-comparison.png"></p><table><tbody><tr>			<td><propname>No LAA</propname></td>
			<td><propname>Fast LAA</propname></td>
			<td><propname>Corrected LAA</propname></td>
			</tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>
			The difference between Fast and Corrected LAA is subtle - Fast LAA has a slight bias in the diagonal directions, making circular shapes appear ever so slightly rhombous and have a slightly sharper curvature in the orthogonal directions, especially when small. Sometimes the edges in the diagonals are slightly fuzzy as well. Corrected AA fixes both of these issues, but uses a slightly more expensive calculation.

			

			</p><h4>Line Thinness Fading</h4><p>
			Lines thinner than 1 pixel, will be locked at 1 pixel wide, and instead start fading opacity based on pixel coverage. This is a very useful technique to ensure that thin lines don't get the pixelated wandering ants effect. Note that this is applied regardless of sizing methods - lines with thickness set in meters will also behave this way as soon as it's smaller than 1 pixel on screen.<br>
			Together with MSAA or LAA, you can get very smooth looking lines. Here's a comparison of a billboard polyline arranged in a sphere, with various options toggled</p><div><div><p><img src="https://acegikmo.com/shapes/images/line-aa-comparison-spheres.gif"></p><table><tbody><tr>			<td><faded>AA off</faded><br><faded>No Thin Fade</faded></td>
			<td><propname>AA on</propname><br><faded>No Thin Fade</faded></td>
			<td><faded>AA off</faded><br><propname>Thin Fade</propname></td>
			<td><propname>AA on</propname><br><propname>Thin Fade</propname></td>
			</tr></tbody></table></div></div>
			
			<h4>Opaque</h4><p>
			Opaque writes to the depth buffer, and sorts properly even when intersecting other shapes. However, it does not support transparency, unless you have MSAA enabled, in which case it will use <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-Blend.html">alpha to coverage</a> to approximate alpha blending. This is especially useful for short alpha fades, such as the edges of the disk shape. Note that MSAA does not work in the scene view, Opaque shapes in the scene view with alpha less than 0.5 are completely invisible, and those above 0.5 are completely opaque</p><lt>
				<li>Alpha-to-Coverage fading support with MSAA enabled</li>
				<li>Writes to the depth buffer</li>
				<li>Opaque 2D Shapes support <a href="#anti-aliasing">LAA</a> if MSAA is enabled</li>
			</lt>

			<h4>Transparent</h4><p>
			Also known as alpha blending - this mode uses the alpha channel of its color as opacity for full transparency support. However, it doesn't write to the depth buffer, which means that intersecting and overlapping shapes using this blend mode may not sort properly
			</p><lt>
				<li>Fades based on alpha</li>
				<li>Order dependent, prone to sorting issues</li>
				<li>Does not write to the depth buffer</li>
				<li><a href="#anti-aliasing">LAA</a> support (2D shapes only)</li>
			</lt>

			<h4>Additive</h4><p>
			Additive is good for glowing/brightening effects against dark backgrounds</p><lt>
				<li>Fades based on alpha, this allows you to fade toward a color while also fading out completely</li>
				<li>Order independent</li>
				<li>Does not write to the depth buffer</li>
				<li><a href="#anti-aliasing">LAA</a> support (2D shapes only)</li>
			</lt>

			<h4>Multiplicative</h4><p>
			Multiplicative is good for tinting/darkening effects against bright backgrounds</p><lt>
				<li>Fades based on alpha, this allows you to fade toward a color while also fading out completely</li>
				<li>Order independent</li>
				<li>Does not write to the depth buffer</li>
				<li><a href="#anti-aliasing">LAA</a> support (2D shapes only)</li>
			</lt>


			<p>
			Shapes with a given thickness, width or radius, generally have configurable units to specify <i>in what space</i> the thickness should be in</p><h4>Meters, m</h4><p>
			Meters relate to the scale of your world, rather than pixels or any other screen-space unit. A line with a thickness in meters, will look thinner when you're further away, just like any other geometry in your game
			</p><h4>Pixels, px</h4><p>
			Pixels are screen-space units, where 1 unit covers a single pixel on your screen. This means that the distance from the camera to the shape won't affect its thickness on screen, and will instead always have a consistent pixel size
			</p><h4>Noots, nt</h4><p>
			Noots are pixel-density independent screen-space units, defined as a fraction of the minimum dimension of your resolution.<br>
			By default, there are 100 noots across the shortest dimension of your resolution, so if you are running 1920x1080, then 1 noot will be </p><msp>min(1920,1080)/100 = 1080/100 = 10.8</msp><p> pixels wide.<br>
			You can configure </p><msp>NOOTS_ACROSS_SCREEN</msp><p> in </p><msp>Shapes Config.cginc</msp><p> if you want to change the default 100 to something else

			</p><p>			For shapes that involve angles, you can specify the angles in three different units in the inspector

			</p><h4>Degrees</h4><p>
			define a full turn as </p><msp>360Â°</msp><p>, meaning a quarter turn is the familiar 90Â° angle

			</p><h4>Turns</h4><p>
			define a full turn as </p><msp>1</msp><p>, which is useful when thinking in fractions of a full turn, where </p><msp>0.5</msp><p> is halfway around the circle, </p><msp>0.25</msp><p> is a quarter way around, and so forth!

			</p><h4>Radians</h4><p>
			define a full turn as </p><msp>6.28... = 2Ï€ = Ï„</msp><p>, which is useful in math formulas involving angles, arc lengths, and other relationships of the circle. Internally, <i>angles are always in radians</i>, across the entire library of Shapes. If you want to convert from degrees to radians, you can use </p><msp>degrees*Mathf.DegToRad</msp><p>, or turns to radians using </p><msp> turns*ShapesMath.TAU</msp>

			<p>			Shapes is designed to be as light on the CPU as possible, by offloading much of the work to the GPU, which means the CPU can focus on your game, while the GPU takes care of all the drawing. Now, performance will vary depending on what side of the library you are using.


			</p><h4>Component Shapes</h4><p>
			These will be part of Unity's regular render pipelines, which means they will gain all the benefits of instancing - most shapes of the same type will be a single draw call, since they can all share the same mesh! However, as a tradeoff, this means that Unity is not able to frustum cull Shapes automatically, so if you construct an entire game using shapes you might start running into performance issues, but in general they'll be very fast. Tweaking parameters like radius and colors and all of that, is essentially free, and all of these things are simple shader parameters in the end! With the exception of polyline, since that one requires a mesh to update if you change points. Though, even that mesh is generated without any heavy math on the CPU, as it's only passing data rather than doing complex miter join calcs etc.</p><lt>
			<li>Shapes of the same type are GPU instanced</li>
			<li>Tweaking per-instance parameters like radius and color is free and doesn't break instancing</li>
			<li>Polylines can't be instanced</li>
			</lt>

			<h4>Immediate-Mode Shapes</h4><p>
			Immediate-mode is by nature, well, drawn immediately, which means they will be outside any kind of render pipeline or batching systems, for better or worse!</p><lt>
			<li>Each immediate-mode draw is one draw call</li>
			<li>No instancing or batching</li>
			</lt>
	

			<p>			To use Shapes in UI, set your UI to either camera-based or world-space UI, this makes Shapes show up!<br>
			Another alternative is to render shapes into a render target, and display the render target in UI</p><p>
			
			Overlay UI mode is however, not supported, using canvas renderers, rect transforms and all, unfortunately.<br>
			It was never actually designed as a UI library, so it wasn't the primary use-case I was focusing on getting up and running, but it was a secondary use case I wanted. However, the reason it doesn't support overlay mode is because <a href="https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer/status/1262333422464372737">it's frankly a nightmare</a>, so the workaround will have to do</p></div> <!-- page lower -->
