<h2>by V.I. Arnold</h2>
</center>

<span size="-1">
This is an extended text of the address at the discussion on
teaching of mathematics in Palais de Découverte in Paris on 
7 March 1997.
</span>
<p>

Mathematics is a part of physics. 
Physics is an experimental science, a part of natural science.
Mathematics is the part of physics where experiments are cheap.
</p><p>

The Jacobi identity (which forces the heights of a triangle to cross at one
point) is an experimental fact in the same way as that the Earth is round
(that is, homeomorphic to a ball). But it can be discovered with less 
expense. 
</p><p>

In the middle of the twentieth century it was attempted to divide physics
and mathematics. The consequences turned out to be catastrophic. 
Whole generations of mathematicians grew up without knowing half 
of their science and, of course,
in total ignorance of any other sciences. They first began teaching  
their ugly scholastic pseudo-mathematics to their students, then to 
schoolchildren (forgetting Hardy's warning that ugly mathematics has no 
permanent place under the Sun).
</p><p>

Since scholastic mathematics that is cut off from physics is fit neither 
for teaching nor for application in any other science, the result was the 
universal hate towards mathematicians - both on the part of the poor 
schoolchildren
(some of whom in the meantime became ministers) and of the users.  
</p><p>
 
The ugly building, built by undereducated mathematicians 
who were exhausted by their 
inferiority complex and who were unable to make themselves familiar with 
physics, reminds one of the rigorous axiomatic theory of odd numbers. 
Obviously, it is possible to create such a theory and make pupils admire the 
perfection and internal consistency of the resulting structure (in which,
for example, the sum of an odd number of terms and the product of any number
of factors are defined). From this sectarian point of view, even
numbers could either be declared a heresy or, with passage of time, be 
introduced into the theory 
supplemented with a few "ideal" objects (in order to comply with the
needs of physics and the real world).
</p><p>

Unfortunately, it was an ugly twisted construction of mathematics like the 
one above which predominated in the teaching of mathematics for decades.
Having originated in France, this pervertedness quickly spread to 
teaching of foundations of 
mathematics, first to university students, then to school pupils
of all lines (first in France, then in other countries, including Russia).
</p><p>

To the question "what is 2 + 3" a French 
primary school pupil replied: "3 + 2,
since addition is commutative". He did not know what the 
sum was equal to and could not even understand what he was asked about!
</p><p>

Another French pupil (quite rational, in my opinion) defined mathematics as
follows: "there is a square, but that still has to be proved".
</p><p>

Judging by my teaching experience in France, the university students' idea of
mathematics (even of those taught mathematics at the École Normale 
Supérieure - I feel sorry most of all for these obviously intelligent
but deformed kids) is as poor as that of this pupil.
</p><p>

For example, these students have never seen a paraboloid and a question on
the form of the surface given by the equation xy = z<sup>2</sup> puts the 
mathematicians studying at ENS into a stupor. Drawing a curve given by
parametric equations (like x = t<sup>3</sup> - 3t, y = t<sup>4</sup> -
2t<sup>2</sup>) on a plane is
a totally impossible problem for students (and, probably, even for 
most French professors of mathematics).
</p><p>

Beginning with l'Hospital's first textbook on calculus ("calculus for 
understanding of curved lines") and roughly until Goursat's textbook, the 
ability to solve such problems was considered to be (along with the
knowledge of the times table) a necessary part of the craft of every 
mathematician.
</p><p>

Mentally challenged zealots of "abstract mathematics" threw all the
geometry (through which connection with physics and reality most often
takes place in mathematics) out of teaching.
Calculus textbooks by Goursat, Hermite, Picard were recently dumped by the
student library of the Universities Paris 6 and 7 (Jussieu) as obsolete
and, therefore, harmful (they were only rescued by my intervention).
</p><p>

ENS students who have sat through courses on differential and algebraic 
geometry (read by respected mathematicians) turned out be acquainted neither
with the Riemann surface of an elliptic curve y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> 
+ ax + b nor, in fact, with the topological classification of surfaces 
(not even mentioning  elliptic integrals of first kind and the group 
property of an elliptic curve, that 
is, the Euler-Abel addition theorem). They were only taught Hodge 
structures and Jacobi varieties!
</p><p>

How could this happen in France, which gave the world Lagrange and Laplace,
Cauchy and Poincaré, Leray and Thom? It seems to me that a reasonable
explanation was given by I.G. Petrovskii, 
who taught me in 1966: genuine mathematicians do
not gang up, but the weak need gangs in order to survive. They can unite on
various grounds (it could be super-abstractness, anti-Semitism or 
"applied and industrial" problems), but the essence is always a solution
of the social problem - survival in conditions of more literate 
surroundings.
</p><p>

By the way, I shall remind you of a warning of L. Pasteur: there never have
been and never will be any "applied sciences", there are only 
<i>applications of sciences</i> (quite useful ones!).
</p><p>

In those times I was treating Petrovskii's words with some doubt, but now I
am being more and more convinced of how right he was. A considerable part of 
the super-abstract activity comes down simply to industrialising shameless
grabbing of discoveries from discoverers and then systematically assigning
them to epigons-generalizers. Similarly to the fact that America does not
carry Columbus's name, mathematical results are almost never called by the 
names of their discoverers.
</p><p>

In order to avoid being misquoted, I have to note that my own achievements
were for some unknown reason never expropriated in this way, 
although it always
happened to both my teachers (Kolmogorov, Petrovskii, Pontryagin, Rokhlin)
and my pupils. Prof. M. Berry once formulated the following two principles:
</p><p>
 
<i>The Arnold Principle.</i> If a notion bears a personal name, 
then this name is not the name of the discoverer.
</p><p>

<i>The Berry Principle.</i> The Arnold Principle is applicable to itself.
</p><p>

Let's return, however, to teaching of mathematics in France.
</p><p>

When I was a first-year student at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics
of the Moscow State University, the lectures on calculus were read by the 
set-theoretic topologist L.A. Tumarkin, who conscientiously retold the old
classical calculus course of French type in the Goursat version. 
He told us that
integrals of rational functions along an algebraic curve
can be taken if the corresponding Riemann
surface is a sphere and, generally speaking, cannot be taken if its genus 
is higher, and that for the sphericity 
it is enough to have a sufficiently large number of double 
points on the curve of a given degree (which forces the curve
to be unicursal: it is possible to draw its real points on the 
projective plane with one stroke of a pen).
</p><p>

These facts capture the imagination so much that (even given without any
proofs) they give a better and more correct idea of modern mathematics than
whole volumes of the Bourbaki treatise. Indeed, here we find out about the 
existence of a wonderful connection between things which seem to be completely
different: on the one hand, the existence of an explicit expression for 
the integrals and the topology
of the corresponding Riemann surface and, on the other hand, between the 
number of double points and genus of the corresponding Riemann surface, which
also exhibits itself in the real domain as the unicursality.
</p><p>

Jacobi noted, as mathematics' most fascinating property, that in it one 
and the same function controls both the presentations of a whole 
number as a sum of four squares and the real movement of a pendulum.
</p><p>

These discoveries of connections between heterogeneous
mathematical objects can be compared with the discovery of the connection 
between
electricity and magnetism in physics or with the discovery of the similarity 
between the east coast of America and the west coast of Africa in geology.
</p><p>

The emotional significance of such discoveries for teaching is difficult to
overestimate. It is they who teach us to search and find such wonderful
phenomena of harmony of the Universe. 
</p><p>

The de-geometrisation of mathematical education and the divorce from physics 
sever these ties. For example, not only students but also modern 
algebro-geometers on the whole do not know about the Jacobi fact 
mentioned here: 
an elliptic integral of first kind expresses the time of motion along an
elliptic phase curve in the corresponding Hamiltonian system.
</p><p>

Rephrasing the famous words on the electron and atom, it can be said that a
hypocycloid is as inexhaustible as an ideal in a polynomial ring. But 
teaching ideals to students who have never seen a hypocycloid is as 
ridiculous
as teaching addition of fractions to children who have never cut (at least 
mentally) a cake or an apple into equal parts. No wonder that the 
children will prefer
to add a numerator to a numerator and a denominator to a denominator.
</p><p>

From my French friends I heard that the tendency towards super-abstract
generalizations is their traditional national trait. I do not entirely 
disagree that this 
might be a question of a hereditary disease, but I would like to underline
the fact that I borrowed the cake-and-apple example from Poincaré.
</p><p>

The scheme of construction of a mathematical theory is exactly the 
same as that
in any other natural science. First we consider some objects and make some 
observations in special cases. Then we try and find the limits of 
application
of our observations, look for counter-examples which would prevent 
unjustified 
extension of our observations onto a too wide range of events
(example:
the number of partitions of consecutive odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 
7, 9 into an odd number of natural summands gives the 
sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,  but then comes 29).
</p><p>

As a result we formulate the empirical discovery that we made (for example,
the Fermat conjecture or Poincaré conjecture) as clearly as possible. 
After this there comes the difficult period of checking as to how reliable
are the conclusions .
</p><p>

At this point a special technique has been developed in mathematics.
This technique, when applied to the real world, is sometimes useful, but can
sometimes also lead to self-deception. This technique is called modelling. 
When constructing a model, the following idealisation is made: certain 
facts which are only known with a certain degree of probability or with a
certain degree of accuracy, are considered to be "absolutely" 
correct and are accepted as "axioms". 
The sense of this "absoluteness" lies precisely in the fact that 
we allow ourselves to use these "facts" according to the rules of
formal logic, in the process declaring as "theorems" all that 
we can derive from them. 
</p><p>

It is obvious that in any real-life activity it is impossible to wholly 
rely on such deductions. The reason is at least that the parameters 
of the studied
phenomena are never known absolutely exactly and a small change in parameters
(for example, the initial conditions of a process) can totally change the 
result. Say, for this reason a reliable long-term weather forecast
is impossible and will remain impossible, no matter how much we develop
computers and devices which record initial conditions.
</p><p>

In exactly the same way a small change in axioms (of which we cannot be 
completely sure) is capable, generally speaking, of leading to completely
different conclusions than those that are obtained from theorems which have
been deduced from the accepted axioms. The longer and fancier is the chain of 
deductions ("proofs"), the less reliable is the final result.
</p><p>

Complex models are rarely useful (unless for those writing their
dissertations).
</p><p>
 
The mathematical technique of modelling consists of ignoring this trouble and
speaking about your deductive model in such a way as if it coincided
with reality. The fact that this path, which is obviously incorrect from the 
point of view of natural science, often leads to useful results in physics is
called "the inconceivable effectiveness of mathematics in natural sciences"
(or "the Wigner principle").
</p><p>

Here we can add a remark by I.M. Gel'fand: there exists yet 
another phenomenon which is comparable in its inconceivability with the 
inconceivable effectiveness
of mathematics in physics noted by Wigner - this is the equally 
inconceivable ineffectiveness of mathematics in biology.
</p><p>

"The subtle poison of mathematical education" (in F. Klein's words) for a
physicist consists precisely in that the
absolutised model separates from the 
reality and is no longer compared with it. Here is a simple example: 
mathematics
teaches us that the solution of the Malthus equation dx/dt = x is uniquely
defined by the initial conditions (that is that the corresponding integral 
curves in the (t,x)-plane do not intersect each other). 
This conclusion
of the mathematical model bears little relevance to the reality. A computer   
experiment shows that all these integral curves have common points on the 
negative t-semi-axis. Indeed, say, curves with the initial 
conditions x(0) = 0 and x(0) = 1 practically intersect at t = -10 and
at t = -100 you cannot fit in an atom between them. Properties of the space at such small 
distances are not described at all by Euclidean geometry. Application of the 
uniqueness theorem in this situation obviously exceeds the accuracy of the 
model. This has to be respected in practical application of the model,
otherwise one might find oneself faced with serious troubles.
</p><p>

I would like to note, however, that the same uniqueness theorem explains why
the closing stage of mooring of a ship to the quay is carried out manually:
on steering, if the velocity of approach would have been defined 
as a smooth (linear) function of the distance, the process of mooring would 
have required an infinitely long period of time. An alternative is an impact 
with the quay (which is damped by suitable non-ideally elastic bodies). By the
way, this problem had to be seriously confronted on landing the first 
descending apparata on the Moon and Mars and also on docking with space 
stations - here the uniqueness theorem is working against us.
</p><p>

Unfortunately, neither such examples, nor discussing the danger of 
fetishising theorems are to be met in modern mathematical textbooks, even in 
the better ones. I even got the impression that scholastic mathematicians
(who have little knowledge of physics) believe in the principal difference 
of the
axiomatic mathematics from modelling which is common in natural science and 
which always requires the subsequent control of deductions by an experiment.
</p><p>

Not even mentioning the relative character of initial axioms, one cannot
forget about the inevitability of logical mistakes in long arguments (say, in 
the form of a computer breakdown caused by cosmic rays or quantum 
oscillations). Every working mathematician knows that if one does not control
oneself (best of all by examples), then after some ten pages half of all the
signs in formulae will be wrong and twos will find their way
from denominators into numerators.
</p><p>

The technology of combatting such errors is the same external control by 
experiments or observations as in any experimental science and it should be
taught from the very beginning to all juniors in schools.
</p><p>

Attempts to create "pure" deductive-axiomatic mathematics have led to the 
rejection of the scheme used in physics 
(observation - model - investigation of the model - 
conclusions - testing by observations) and its substitution by the scheme:
definition - theorem - proof. It is impossible to understand an unmotivated
definition but this does not stop the criminal algebraists-axiomatisators. 
For example, they would readily define the product of natural numbers 
by means of the long multiplication rule.
With this the commutativity of multiplication becomes difficult to
prove but it is still possible to deduce it as a theorem from the axioms. 
It is then possible to force poor students to learn this theorem and its proof
(with the aim of raising the standing of both the science and  
the persons teaching it). It is obvious that such definitions and 
such proofs can only harm the teaching and practical work.
</p><p>

It is only possible to understand the commutativity of multiplication by 
counting and re-counting soldiers by ranks and files or by calculating the
area of a rectangle in the two ways. Any attempt to do without this interference
by physics and reality into mathematics is sectarianism and isolationism which
destroy the image of mathematics as a useful human activity in the eyes of 
all sensible people.
</p><p>

I shall open a few more such secrets (in the interest of poor students).
</p><p>

The <i>determinant</i> of a matrix is an (oriented) volume of the 
parallelepiped whose edges are its columns. If the students are told this
secret (which is carefully hidden in the purified algebraic education),
then the whole theory of determinants becomes a clear chapter of 
the theory of poly-linear forms. If determinants are defined otherwise, then
any sensible person will forever hate all the determinants, Jacobians and the
implicit function theorem.
</p><p>

What is a <i>group</i>? Algebraists teach that this is supposedly a set with
two operations that satisfy a load of easily-forgettable axioms. This 
definition provokes a natural protest: why would any sensible person need such
pairs of operations? "Oh, curse this maths" 
- concludes the student (who, possibly, becomes the Minister for Science in 
the future).
</p><p>

We get a totally different situation if we start off not with the group 
but with the concept of a transformation (a one-to-one mapping of a set
onto itself)
as it was historically. A collection of transformations of a set is 
called a group if along with any two transformations it contains the result
of their consecutive application and an inverse transformation 
along with every transformation.
</p><p>

This is all the definition there is. The so-called "axioms" are in fact
just (obvious) <i>properties</i> of groups of transformations. 
What axiomatisators
call "abstract groups" are just groups of transformations of various sets
considered up to isomorphisms (which are one-to-one mappings 
preserving the operations). As Cayley proved, there are no "more abstract"
groups in the world. So why do the algebraists keep on tormenting students 
with the abstract definition?
</p><p>

By the way, in the 1960s I taught group theory to Moscow 
<i>schoolchildren</i>. Avoiding all the axiomatics and staying as close as 
possible to physics, in half a year I got to the Abel theorem on the 
unsolvability of a general equation of degree five in radicals (having
on the way taught the pupils complex numbers, Riemann surfaces, fundamental
groups and monodromy groups of algebraic functions). This course was later
published by one of the audience, V. Alekseev, as the book
<i>The Abel theorem in problems</i>.
</p><p>

What is a <i>smooth manifold</i>? In a recent American book I read that
Poincaré was not acquainted with this (introduced by himself) 
notion and that
the "modern" definition was only given by Veblen in the late 1920s: 
a manifold is a topological space which satisfies a long series of axioms.
</p><p>

For what sins must students try and find their way through all these twists
and turns? Actually, in Poincaré's <i>Analysis Situs</i> there is an 
absolutely
clear definition of a smooth manifold which is much more useful than the 
"abstract" one.
</p><p>

A smooth k-dimensional submanifold of the Euclidean space
<b>R</b><sup>N</sup> is its
subset which in a neighbourhood of its every point is a graph of a smooth
mapping of <b>R</b><sup>k</sup> into <b>R</b><sup>(N - k)</sup> 
(where <b>R</b><sup>k</sup> and <b>R</b><sup>(N - k)</sup> are coordinate
subspaces). This is a straightforward generalization of most 
common smooth
curves on the plane (say, of the circle x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 1) 
or curves and surfaces in the three-dimensional space.
</p><p>

Between smooth manifolds smooth mappings are naturally defined. 
Diffeomorphisms are mappings which are smooth, together with their inverses.
</p><p>

An "abstract" smooth manifold is a smooth submanifold of a Euclidean space
considered up to a diffeomorphism. There are no "more abstract" 
finite-dimensional smooth manifolds in the world (Whitney's theorem). 
Why do we keep on 
tormenting students with the abstract definition? 
Would it not be better to prove them
the theorem about the explicit classification of closed two-dimensional 
manifolds (surfaces)?
</p><p>

It is this wonderful theorem (which states, for example, that any compact 
connected oriented surface is a sphere with a number of handles) that gives 
a correct impression of what modern mathematics is and not the 
super-abstract 
generalizations of naive submanifolds of a Euclidean space which in fact 
do not give anything new and are presented as achievements by the
axiomatisators.
</p><p>

The theorem of classification of surfaces is a top-class mathematical 
achievement, comparable with the discovery of America or X-rays. This is a
genuine discovery of mathematical natural science and it is 
even difficult to say
whether the fact itself is more attributable to physics or to mathematics. In
its significance for both the applications and the development of correct
Weltanschauung it by far surpasses such "achievements" of
mathematics as the proof of Fermat's last theorem or the proof of the fact 
that any sufficiently large whole number can be represented as a sum of three
prime numbers. 
</p><p>

For the sake of publicity modern mathematicians sometimes 
present such sporting 
achievements as the last word in their science. Understandably this not only 
does not contribute to the society's appreciation of mathematics 
but, on the
contrary, causes a healthy distrust of the necessity of wasting energy on 
(rock-climbing-type) exercises with these exotic questions 
needed and wanted by no one.
</p><p>

The theorem of classification of surfaces should have been included in high
school mathematics courses (probably, without the proof) but for some reason
is not included even in university mathematics courses (from which in France,
by the way, all the geometry has been banished over the last few decades).
</p><p>

The return of mathematical teaching at all levels 
from the scholastic chatter to presenting the important domain of
natural science is an espessially hot 
problem for France. I was astonished that all the best and most important in 
methodical approach mathematical books are almost unknown to students here
(and, seems to me, have not been translated into French). Among these are 
<i>Numbers and figures</i> by Rademacher and Töplitz, <i>Geometry and 
the imagination</i> by Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen, 
<i>What is mathematics?</i> by Courant and Robbins, <i>How to solve it</i>
and <i>Mathematics
and plausible reasoning</i> by Polya, <i>Development of
mathematics in the 19th century</i> by F. Klein.
</p><p>

I remember well what a strong impression the calculus course by Hermite
(which does exist in a Russian translation!) made on me in my school years.
</p><p>

Riemann surfaces appeared in it, I think, in one of the first lectures (all
the analysis was, of course, complex, as it should be). Asymptotics of 
integrals were investigated by means of path deformations on Riemann
surfaces under the motion of branching points (nowadays, we would have called
this the Picard-Lefschetz theory; Picard, by the way, was Hermite's
son-in-law - mathematical abilities are often transferred by 
sons-in-law: the dynasty Hadamard - P. Levy - L. Schwarz - U. Frisch is
yet another famous example in the Paris Academy of Sciences).
</p><p>

The "obsolete" course by Hermite of one hundred years ago (probably, now
thrown away from student libraries of French universities) 
was much more modern than those most boring calculus 
textbooks with which students are nowadays tormented.
</p><p>

If mathematicians do not come to their senses, 
then the consumers who preserved 
a need in a modern, in the best meaning of the word, 
mathematical theory as well
as the immunity (characteristic of any
sensible person) to the useless axiomatic chatter 
will in the end turn down the services of the undereducated scholastics
in both the schools and the universities.
</p><p>

A teacher of mathematics, who has not got to grips with at least some 
of the volumes of the course by Landau and Lifshitz, will then become 
a relict like the one nowadays who does not know the difference 
between an open and a closed set.
