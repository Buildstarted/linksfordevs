It was the most pragmatic and logical choice, they were comfortable with the stack and able to ship quickly. Over the years, Criteo engineers have always done pragmatic tech stack decisions, leveraging open-source as much as possible when it was available.</p><p id="59a0" data-selectable-paragraph="">As a result, when Criteo became an advertising company, we used OpenX, an open-source ad server in PHP running on Linux, and a home-made .NET recommendation engine running on IIS and Windows. Once the product took off, OpenX quickly became a performance bottleneck and difficult to scale because engineers felt more comfortable working in .NET. It took just a couple of weeks sometimes in 2009 to re-write an ad server in .NET running on Windows. Over the next years, Criteo scaled to tens of thousands of Windows servers running more and more .NET services.</p><p id="b361" data-selectable-paragraph="">This post is part of a series of posts explaining why and how we worked over the last few years to reduce our Windows footprint and move our .NET application to our container platform on Linux.</p><p id="d7ca" data-selectable-paragraph="">We have adopted Chef in 2012 to automate our Linux fleet (used by Hadoop and other databases), and we quickly came to the conclusion that it was great to manage our ever-growing bare metal fleet. We started using Chef on our Windows fleet too, and we’ve been <a href="https://labs.criteo.com/2016/07/windows-chef-cooking-criteo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pretty good at it</a>, regularly contributing to the Chef community. But after some time we also realized that it was very hard to hire engineers that were willing to work on automation for both Linux and Windows, and our systems engineering culture was mostly oriented towards Linux since this is where we built our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/criteo-labs/40pb-per-year-the-challenge-of-data-growth-at-criteo-5d5b73ec5294">big data platform</a>, our high-performance storage, and<a href="https://www.confluent.io/kafka-summit-sf17/Infrastructure-for-Streaming-Applications-in-Criteo" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> streaming platform</a>.</p><p id="766f" data-selectable-paragraph="">As an example, we had multiple iterations of deployment systems trying to push application binaries, going from remote desktop drag &amp; drop (the <em>good old days</em>) to our <a href="https://github.com/criteo/perpetuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Perpetuo </a>+ Rundeck setup with <a href="https://github.com/criteo-cookbooks/winrm-config" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WinRM</a>, going through our own <a href="https://capistranorb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capistrano</a>-like system with SSH/Cygwin. We always had a hard time understanding the Windows way and were constantly fighting the system, then embracing it when we finally understood it.</p><p id="a7d5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Running Windows servers on bare metal with Chef meant that we had to pre-allocate each server to a specific app. Our chef deployment cycle was relatively slow to add or remove servers in a specific application pool. Most teams with large applications learned to over-provision their pool a bit to prevent issues, making less efficient use of available servers. Teams with very small resource requirements were asked to provide up to 4 bare metal servers for a single application (for cross-data center high availability and our pre-production environment). This was extremely inefficient for small applications, and developers started adding new endpoints (<em>handlers</em>) to existing monolithic applications instead of provisioning a new application.</p><p id="09f0" data-selectable-paragraph="">We tried to automate as much as possible our IIS configuration and stack multiple services on a single server, but it was still difficult and painful to create a brand new application in .NET. What we needed was some decoupling between the application layer and the bare metal layer.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*B2jpQ_lcJbdyYxZR?q=20" width="1387" height="924"></p><p><img alt="Image for post" width="1387" height="924"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">Our data center team has incredible cabling skills (and good taste).</figcaption></figure><p id="9b44" data-selectable-paragraph="">Criteo was built in France before the public cloud existed. Since the main usage of our hardware was large monolithic applications that we replicated on many servers, we never took advantage of virtualization.</p><p id="ecb6" data-selectable-paragraph="">We built our first <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hadoop </a>cluster in 2011, and after some time started using <a href="http://mesos.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mesos </a>in 2014 as a side project to run Linux <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jenkins </a>jobs. We were familiar with the use of containers (a group of processes isolated from the rest of the host via Linux namespaces and groups) and were seduced by the simplicity, and few Google papers (<a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/fr//pubs/archive/43438.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Borg </a>and <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/fr//pubs/archive/41684.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Omega</a>). In 2015 we used Mesos/Marathon in production to run some JVM apps. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kubernetes </a>was in its infancy and not ready to scale at the time. It was also very hard to deploy on bare-metal (network setup for high performance was hard for example). We kept going with Mesos since it was much simpler to manage, adapt, and integrate to our current datacenters. Soon after introducing Mesos we also introduced <a href="https://www.consul.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Consul </a>to our container platform to manage the<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/criteo-labs/discovery-with-consul-at-scale-1d6808202d86"> dynamic discovery of services within the datacenter</a>. But this was all running on Linux and did not solve our problem with Windows servers.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*aZNEY9TQ3IX1zw6fMmqtOQ.png?q=20" width="423" height="232"></p><p><img alt="Image for post" width="423" height="232"></p></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">We run 18k containers over 260k CPU cores globally. This is the current resource usage of one of our clusters.</figcaption></figure><p id="5136" data-selectable-paragraph="">Since the beginning of our Hadoop journey, Criteo has heavily invested in Java and Scala to build our data platform. The JVM was the second-largest runtime used internally so it was natural to see if we could build JVM applications for our web <em>real-time</em> platform. In 2015 up to 2018 we have built a couple of large scale Scala applications with the <a href="https://twitter.github.io/finatra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">finatra </a>framework, running on Marathon/Mesos. But we quickly realized that we would (and <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">should</a>!) never re-write our entire .NET codebase to the JVM.</p><p id="a39f" data-selectable-paragraph="">In 2016, our Microsoft friends in Redmond<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> released the first version of .NET Core</a>, running on Linux and Windows. It was very early stage and the compatibility with our codebase was clearly not there yet, but the following months have shown that Microsoft was truly committed to .NET Core, and when 2.0 came out in 2017, it was clear for us that we picked the right platform to build upon.</p><p id="47a1" data-selectable-paragraph="">2016 is precisely when the journey started, we had Mesos/Marathon being adopted as the go-to platform, .NET Core became our go-to runtime. We invested a lot in 2017 and 2018 into tooling around .NET Core, and we migrated our biggest application the following year.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
