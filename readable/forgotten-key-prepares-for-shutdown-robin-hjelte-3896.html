Now we are at roads end, and without a dramatic turn of events we will very soon close the doors to our studio.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*-_Af5EaYvkWpIQt9UwMJ4g.gif?q=20" width="570" height="408" role="presentation"></p><p><img width="570" height="408" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph="">With love and llambas</figcaption></figure><p id="29a0" data-selectable-paragraph="">The last few years for us was much about finalizing and releasing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331870/AER_Memories_of_Old/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AER Memories of Old</a>, including porting and patching. That time was also about finding the next project, to fit in with how the market moves and try to find ways to sustain a growing studio.

You have all made an impact in our lives in a way we couldnâ€™t have dreamed of when we set out as a small inexperienced student team with a game concept or two.</p><p id="8d20" data-selectable-paragraph="">We will use this occasion to release demos and material that has been secret up until now. <strong>This includes playable demos ready to download for free on </strong><a href="http://itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>itch.io</strong></a><strong> (links to the demos below) for two new games and worlds we had in the making:</strong></p></div></div></div></div>
