As you can see, it can be set up just about anywhere, such as on top of your DSLR camera, allowing you to take photos and movies at the same time. Ot use the clamp and mount it on a door, branch, or whatever. You might even want to just mount it directly on a tripod or selfie stick for extreme flexibility.<p>This item is super-heavy duty, which also means it weighs more than is necessary. I'd really like to see a lighter weight version, perhaps made out of aluminum or carbon fiber. You also have to get used to the fact that everything tightens down from the single wing nut where the 2 pieces join - in other words, the ball joints on the ends are also controlled by the center wing nut, which took me a while to figure out. Finally, the cell phone mount is the spring-loaded type - I prefer the screw down type, but since I already have one of those, this is certainly not a big deal for me.</p><p>That said, this item is now being packed in my "mobile studio" so I don't have to worry about getting the perfect shot or video. It's easy to pack and the versatility makes it worth bringing along.</p></span>

This one doesn't seem to follow that guideline though and is working just great for me. I'm using it with my FeelWorld T7 with a NPF-970 battery and it holds it just fine in any position I want to. The only downside I could see is that when you're not using the included hotshoe mount and connect it directly to a camera cage or something with the 1/4" 20 screw it can easily twist. That's really just the downside of using a single 1/4" 20 having arri locating pins would really help with that. Can't really expect that at this price but I'm sure there's a cheap adapter for that which would make this thing perfect for any kind of use.<p>The super clamp is a really nice addition though and makes it possible to attach this to some rods. The clamp itself is very sturdy as well though again there's no arri locating hole on it. That wasn't as much of an issue for the clamp in my use but there's some angles where that could be a bit cumbersome. Definitely still a great buy though and would recommend this to help with getting the right monitor angle/height for your shots.</p></span>

These types of products have a tendency to be loose and sloppy, especially in this price range, but this arm is crazy solid. If you're considering getting a ball hed to do hold you camera monitor, don't. Having a magic arm, especially this one, will allow you to put your camera in all sorts of hard to reach places and still see the monitor incredibly well.

The Magic Arm is made of mostly metal with very little plastic.  It is rated to hold 22lb, while I didn’t test its weight limitations I did mount anything I would normally use onto the arm with no hesitation.  The arm uses a unique locking system that allows you to lock the arm out using one single knob.  I find this Arm can hold lights, phones, flashes, monitors, and more.  The claw opens to a width of 2.2 inches and uses a 1/4-20 hole to attach the Magic Arm but also has a 3/8 hole in case you would like to attach another device.  The end of the arm has an attachment allowing you use the 1/4-20 mount or add the included mount to add flashes to the arm as needed.  This arm easily held everything I needed it to hold, I would definitely recommend this item.  Please see the pictures to get an idea of the capabilities of this arm and YES it’s holding an AD200!  If you don’t have an assistant, this device can definitely help you out.</span>

The arm's unique design features a single-point locking mechanism, which gives the user maximum flexibility. Moving the display on multiple axes is quick and easy, allowing users to find the best possible viewing angle. In addition, the bottom vertical spacer piece is removable to reveal a 1/4"-20 male screw, and the bottom shoe mount is removable to reveal a 1/4"-20 female thread.</p><p>The full length of this arm (tip-to-tip) measures 11", and the usable extension range (end-joint to end-joint) measures around 8.3".</p><p>The mini clamp that comes with this kit is a smaller version of the popular "Impact Super Clamp". Weighing in at a mere 4 oz, this clamp feels sturdy enough to support a fair payload without much troubles. This, and the fact that it comes with 1/4"-20 and 3/8" female sockets, makes it useful for use with most standard camera and grip accessories. It's also useful for small sets or tabletop photography.</p><p>The clamp is made of lightweight aluminum and features a textured, nonslip jaw grip that is optimized to work with poles or flat objects.</p><p>So far, I am pretty impressed and happy with this kit and would definitely recommend it to anybody in the market for this kind of accessory to add to their camera gear.</p></span>
