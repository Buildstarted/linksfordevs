<p>My colleague <strong>Mesut</strong> asked me if using random identifiers of 128-bit would be enough to avoid collisions.</p>
<p>I've been asked similar questions, and every time my answer goes something like this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>you need to calculate <strong>the number of outputs</strong> you need to generate in order to get good odds of finding collisions. If that number is impressively large, then it's fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>birthday bound</strong> is often used to calculate this. If you crypto, you must have heard of something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with the SHA-256 hash function, you need to generate at least 2<sup>128</sup> hashes in order to have more than 50% chance of finding collisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you know that usually, you can just divide the exponent of your domain space by two to find out how much output you need to generate to reach such a collision.</p>
<p>Now, this figure is a bit <strong>deceiving</strong> when it comes to <strong>real world cryptography</strong>. This is because we probably don't want to define "<strong>OK, this is bad</strong>" as someone reaching the point of having 50% chance of finding a collision. Rather, we want to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>someone reaching <strong>one in a billion</strong> chance (or something much lower) to find a collision would be bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, what does it mean for us? How many identifiers are we going to generate per second? How much time are we willing to keep this thing secure?</p>
<p>To truly answer this question, one needs to plug in the correct numbers and play with the birthday bound formula. Since this is not the first time I had to do this, I thought to myself "why don't I create an app for this?" and <a href="https://www.davidwong.fr/whatsmybirthday">voila</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.davidwong.fr/whatsmybirthday">You can play with it here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to my tool, I can now answer Mesut's question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you generate one million identifiers per second, in 26 years you will have one in a billion chance to generate a collision. Is this enough?
If this is not adversary-controlled, or it is rate-limited, you will probably not generate millions of identifiers per second though, but rather thousands, in this case it will take 265 centuries to get these odds.</p>
