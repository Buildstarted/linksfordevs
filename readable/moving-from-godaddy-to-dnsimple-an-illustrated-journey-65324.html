<p>I just moved all my DNS things from GoDaddy to DNSimple. The reasons are self-evident; here’s the visual journey.</p> <h2>The public face</h2> <p>Danica Patrick: Model, racing driver who can go fast in circles and attractive promo face:</p> <p><img width="500" height="375" title="" alt="Danica Patrick - pretty face, but does she know her way around a zone file?

Oh wait - THERE *ARE* NO RESTRICTIONS!" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45284527image38.png"></p> <p>So I changed my password to: <strong>Super strong! -&gt; ? ^'":&amp;&gt;&lt;~;`*)(_-=+|[]{}.,/</strong></p> <p>(And then changed it to something else, just in case you’re wondering…)</p> <h2>Login insecurity</h2> <p>Insecure:</p> <p><img width="880" height="402" title="" alt="We're gonna logon like it's 1999!" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45304529image3.png"></p> <p>Secure:</p> <p><img width="880" height="481" title="" alt="SSL - check.

Ya gotta upsize!" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45204519image50.png"></p> <p>No, I don’t want to buy this:</p> <p><img width="500" height="329" title="" alt="What about a shake? Can we sell you a shake?" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45184517image53.png"></p> <p>Or this:</p> <p><img width="500" height="353" title="" alt="Ok, two words: Steak Knives" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45164515image56.png"></p> <p>This either:</p> <p><img width="500" height="378" title="" alt="C'mon, I've got a family to feed - buy our things!" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45144513image59.png"></p> <p>And did I really have to scroll through all that crap just to continue?!</p> <p>Already told you I didn’t want this on the last screen:</p> <p><img width="500" height="372" title="" alt="One of my kids has a gammy leg, I REALLY need you to upsize" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45124511image62.png"></p> <p>Oh FFS, we’ve been through this already:</p> <p><img width="500" height="127" title="" alt="My wife needs shoes too -Manolos, please" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45104509image65.png"></p> <p>No, no, no – no more crap!</p> <p><img width="500" height="82" title="" alt="She'll need two of them too (shoes, that is)" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45044503image68.png"></p> <p>Oh good, it’s the end – hang on, it’s meant to be $9.99?!?!</p> <p><img width="500" height="161" title="" alt="This is like buying and airline ticket: Cost is $100. Oh plus a booking fee. You want luggage with that? If you want a seat we'll need more money. Want to sit with your kids? More money again please." src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45064505image71.png"></p> <p>Or alternatively, add the domain (hi Scott!):</p> <p><img width="819" height="574" title="" alt="Wait - where are the ads?! Where's the up-sell?! Ok, WHOIS privacy is *kinda* an up-sell, but this is the point you want to know about it and it's not exactly in flashing lights and garish colours." src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45084507image74.png"></p> <p>And register it:</p> <p><img width="896" height="503" title="" alt="And... we're done. What am I going to do with all the free time I now have on my hands?!" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45024501image77.png"></p> <p>Job done.</p> <h2>Configuring DNS</h2> <p>Go and work it out yourself:</p> <p><img width="545" height="465" title="" alt="DNS can be *hard* (ask me how I know!), have we really not progressed beyond manual entry of DNS records in the last decade?!" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/44964495image31.png"></p> <p>Hi, what’s the name of your Azure website (or other service) and we’ll sort it out for you:</p> <p><img width="422" height="320" title="" alt="This, I like! If I don't have to see an IP address when I'm setting up DNS, I get a little bit happy :)" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/44944493image6125255B125255D.png"></p> <h2>On being socially engineered</h2> <p>Because they let a hacker just keep guessing someone’s credit number until they got it right then allowed him to take over the victim’s account and made it very bloody hard on him to get it back:</p> <p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/godaddy-admits-hackers-social-engineering-led-it-to-divulge-info-in-n-twitter-account-hack/"><img width="822" height="758" title="" alt="Seriously WTF - what sort of security control lets an attacker brute-force human operators?! I mean I've heard of social engineering, but this is ridiculous!" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/45004499image10.png"></a></p> <p>And DNSimple? Refer back to the picture of Anthony and the aforementioned beard – does this <em>look</em> like a guy who’s going to be socially engineered?!</p> <h2>Promoting the service</h2> <p>Because the girls look pretty (mostly), but they don’t give me much confidence in what GoDaddy actually does:</p> <p><img width="400" height="300" title="" alt="Those are some impressive MX records!" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/44924491godaddy2.jpg"><img width="320" height="205" title="" alt="This is EXACTLY the same expression I always have when looking at a, well, you know..." src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/44904489danica_godaddy_6162.jpg"><img width="334" height="500" title="" alt="Where's the pitch?! Ya gotta have a pitch! Oh yeah, the naked chick..." src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/44884487danica-patrick-go-daddy3.jpg"><img width="400" height="300" title="" alt="All these people were logged out of thier GoDaddy account whilst in the middle of something important simly because they didn't click any buttons for a while. They're clearly pissed, as am I when it happens." src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/448644851390324972000-godaddy-patrick5.jpg"><img width="370" height="226" title="" alt="There's nothing we can all relate to better than a gorgeous young woman getting it on with a chubby, pasty, bespectacled geek" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/44844483godaddy-ad-18.jpg"><img width="400" height="300" title="" alt="Nothing says &quot;We know domains&quot; better than spraying champagne over a a gorgeous girl in a white tank top" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/44804479godaddy-ad3.jpg"><img width="300" height="226" title="" alt="It's a bit hard to read, but those are actually valid SPF records on her arms and TXT records on the thighs" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/44824481Model-Natalia-Velez-in-a-Super-Bowl-.png"><img width="500" height="251" title="" alt="At least the support staff have lovely looking, uh, &quot;personalities&quot;" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/44784477godaddy-tank-top-ad4.png"></p> <p>Because these guys promote – and actually <em>use</em> – DNSimple. They’re not as pretty, but they know their MX records from their CNAMEs and that counts for a lot in my book:</p> <p><img width="200" height="200" title="" alt="Hanselman - he rates it " src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/44764475I_sH-zvU1.jpg"><img width="266" height="129" title="" alt="Richard and Carl - also rate it, you want to listen when these guys talk" src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/44744473carlrichard22.jpg"></p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>My domains are precious; they protect huge investments in time and money and I don’t want some sleazy-marketing, privacy-invading, password-character-limiting, insecure-auth’ing, anti-non-american, up-selling, “work-it-the-hell-out-yourself”, socially-engineerable, ceo-elephant-shooting business looking after them for me.</p> <p>Like the idea of DNSimple?
