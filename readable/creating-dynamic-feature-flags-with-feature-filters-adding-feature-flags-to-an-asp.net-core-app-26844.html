<p>In the <a href="https://andrewlock.net/introducing-the-microsoft-featuremanagement-library-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-1/">first post</a> in this series, I introduced the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FeatureManagement/1.0.0-preview-009000001-1251"><em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em> library</a>, and showed how to use it to add feature flags to an ASP.NET Core app. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://andrewlock.net/filtering-action-methods-with-feature-flags-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-2/">second post</a>, I introduced the companion library <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore/1.0.0-preview-009000001-1251"><em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore</em></a>, and showed the ASP.NET Core-specific features it adds such as Tag Helpers and Action Filters.</p>
<p>In this post, I introduce feature filters, which are a much more powerful way of working with feature flags. These let you enable a feature based on arbitrary data. For example, you could enable a feature based on headers in an incoming request, based on the current time, or based on the current user's claims. </p>
<p>In this post I'll show how to use the two feature filters included in the <em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em> library, <code>PercentageFilter</code> and <code>TimeWindowFilter</code>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em> was introduced in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmd0Vh6pFfE">recent .NET Community Standup</a> and is currently in preview, so some details may change when it's properly released.</p>

<h2 id="expanding-feature-flags-beyond-simple-booleans">Expanding feature flags beyond simple Booleans<a href="#expanding-feature-flags-beyond-simple-booleans"></a></h2>
<p>So far in this series I've demonstrated using feature flags that are "fixed" in configuration:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"FeatureManagement"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"Beta"</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>With this configuration, the <code>Beta</code> feature flag is always <code>false</code> for all users (until configuration changes). While this will be useful in some cases, you may often want to enable features for only some of your users, or only some of the time. </p>
<p>For example, maybe you're working on a new feature, and you only want a few of your users to be able to see it, in case there are any issues with it. Alternatively, maybe you're running a promotion on an store, and you only want a banner to be enabled for a specific time period. Neither of these options are possible with the simple flags we've seen so far.</p>
<p><em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em> introduces an interface <code>IFeatureFilter</code> which can be used to decide whether a feature is enabled or not based on any logic you require. Two simple implementations are included out of the box, <code>TimeWindowFilter</code> and <code>PercentageFilter</code>, which I'll introduce below.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-a-feature-flag-based-on-the-current-time-with-timewindowfilter">Enabling a feature flag based on the current time with <code>TimeWindowFilter</code><a href="#enabling-a-feature-flag-based-on-the-current-time-with-timewindowfilter"></a></h2>
<p>The <code>TimeWindowFilter</code> does as its name suggests - it enables a feature for a given time window. You provide the start and ending <code>DateTime</code>, and any calls to <code>IFeatureManager.IsEnabled()</code> for the feature will be <code>true</code> only between those times. </p>
<p>The example below continues from the <a href="https://andrewlock.net/filtering-action-methods-with-feature-flags-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-2/">previous posts</a>, so it assumes you've already <a href="https://andrewlock.net/introducing-the-microsoft-featuremanagement-library-adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part-1/#installing-the-package">installed the NuGet package</a>. The <code>TimeWindowFilter</code> (and <code>PercentageFilter</code>) is available in the .NET Standard <em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em> library, so you can use it in any .NET Standard application. I'm going to assume it's an ASP.NET Core app for this post.</p>
<p>Add the feature management services in <code>Startup.ConfigureServices</code>, by calling <code>AddFeatureManagement()</code>, which returns an <code>IFeatureManagementBuilder</code>. You can enable the time window filter by calling <code>AddFeatureFilter&lt;&gt;()</code> on the builder:</p>
<pre><code><span>using</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>FeatureManagement<span>;</span>
<span>using</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>FeatureManagement<span>.</span>FeatureFilters<span>;</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Startup</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        services<span>.</span><span>AddFeatureManagement</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
            <span>.</span><span><span>AddFeatureFilter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TimeWindowFilter</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This adds the <code>IFeatureFilter</code> to your app, but you need to configure it using the configuration system. Each <code>IFeatureFilter</code> can have an associated "settings" object, depending on the implementation. For the <code>TimeWindowFilter</code>, this looks like: </p>
<pre><code><span>internal</span> <span>class</span> <span>TimeWindowSettings</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> DateTimeOffset<span>?</span> Start <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>public</span> DateTimeOffset<span>?</span> End <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So let's consider a scenario: I want to enable a custom Christmas banner which goes live on boxing day at 2am UTC, and ends three days later at 1am UTC. </p>
<p>We'll start by creating a feature flag for it in code called <code>ChristmasBanner</code></p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>FeatureFlags</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>const</span> <span>string</span> ChristmasBanner <span>=</span> <span>"ChristmasBanner"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we'll add the configuration. As before, we nest the configuration under the <code>FeatureManagement</code> key and provide the name of the feature. However, instead of using a Boolean for the feature, we use <code>EnabledFor</code>, and specify an array of feature filters.</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"FeatureManagement"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"ChristmasBanner"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"EnabledFor"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>{</span>
          <span>"Name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Microsoft.TimeWindow"</span><span>,</span>
          <span>"Parameters"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>"Start"</span><span>:</span> <span>"26 Dec 2019 02:00:00 +00:00"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"End"</span><span>:</span> <span>"29 Dec 2019 01:00:00 +00:00"</span>
          <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>]</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It's important you get the configuration correct here. The general pattern is identical for all feature filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The feature name ("ChristmasBanner") should be the key of an <em>object</em>:</li>
<li>This object should contains a single property, <code>EnabledFor</code>, which is an <em>array</em> of <em>objects</em>. </li>
<li>Each of the objects in the array represents an <code>IFeatureFilter</code>. For each filter<ul>
<li>Provide the <code>Name</code> of the filter ("Microsoft.TimeWindow" for the <code>TimeWindowFilter</code>)</li>
<li>Optionally provide a <code>Parameters</code> object, which is bound to the settings object of the feature filter (<code>TimeWindowSettings</code> in this case).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If <em>any</em> of the feature filters in the array are satisfied for a given request, the feature is enabled. It is only disabled if <em>all</em> <code>IFeatureFilter</code>s indicate it should be disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this configuration, the <code>ChristmasBanner</code> feature flag will return false until <code>DateTime.UtcNow</code> falls between the provided dates:</p>
<pre><code><span>using</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>FeatureManagement<span>;</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>IndexModel</span> <span>:</span> <span>PageModel</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>IFeatureManager</span> _featureManager<span>;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>IndexModel</span><span>(</span><span>IFeatureManager</span> featureManager<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        _featureManager <span>=</span> featureManager<span>;</span>
        
        <span>var</span> showBanner <span>=</span> _featureManager<span>.</span><span>IsEnabled</span><span>(</span>FeatureFlags<span>.</span>ChristmasBanner<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The real benefit to using <code>IFeatureFilter</code>s is that you get dynamic behaviour, but you can still control it from configuration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that <code>TimeWindowSettings</code> has nullable values for <code>Start</code> and <code>End</code>, to give you open-ended time windows e.g. always enable until a given date, or only enable from a given date.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="rolling-features-out-slowly-with-percentagefilter">Rolling features out slowly with <code>PercentageFilter</code><a href="#rolling-features-out-slowly-with-percentagefilter"></a></h2>
<p>The <code>PercentageFilter</code> also behaves as you might expect - it only enables a feature for <code>x</code> percent of requests, where <code>x</code> is controlled via settings. Enabling the <code>PercentageFilter</code> follows the same procedure as for <code>TimeWindowFilter</code>. </p>
<p>Add the <code>PercentageFilter</code> in <code>ConfigureServices()</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>using</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>FeatureManagement<span>;</span>
<span>using</span> Microsoft<span>.</span>FeatureManagement<span>.</span>FeatureFilters<span>;</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Startup</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> services<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        services<span>.</span><span>AddFeatureManagement</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
            <span>.</span><span><span>AddFeatureFilter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>PercentageFilter</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Create a feature flag:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>FeatureFlags</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>const</span> <span>string</span> FancyFonts <span>=</span> <span>"FancyFonts"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Configure the feature in configuration:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"FeatureManagement"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"FancyFonts"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"EnabledFor"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>{</span>
          <span>"Name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Microsoft.Percentage"</span><span>,</span>
          <span>"Parameters"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>"Value"</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span>
          <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>]</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>PercentageSettings</code> object consists of a single <code>int</code>, which is the percentage of the time the flag should be enabled. In the example above, the flag will be enabled for 10% of calls to <code>IFeatureManager.IsEnabled(FeatureFlags.FancyFonts)</code>.</p>
<p>That last sentence may sound a bit off to you. Does that mean that if you call <code>IsEnabled()</code> twice in the same request, the <code>PercentageFilter</code> could give different answers? Yes! </p>
<p>On top of that, subsequent requests would be subject to the same potential flipping back and forth, so users could see features popping in and out as they browse your site. </p>
<p>Luckily, there are solutions to both of these problems built into the library, but I'm going to leave them for a later post.</p>
<p>The two filters shown here are built into <em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em>, but you're free to implement your own. In the next post, I'll show how to create a custom <code>IFeatureFilter</code> that enables features based on the currently logged in user.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary"></a></h2>
<p><em>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</em> allows you to enable feature flags based on values in configuration. By using <code>IFeatureFilter</code> you can get dynamic behaviour, even though your configuration may be static. The <code>TimeWindowFilter</code> and <code>PercentageFilter</code> are included in the library and provide basic dynamic feature flags. To add them to your app you must enable them by calling <code>AddFeatureFilter&lt;&gt;()</code> in <code>Startup.ConfigureServices()</code>, and adding the appropriate configuration.</p>
