<p>As the fourth post in this mini-series on functional programming on .NET, I wanted to go back to what started down this series, which is this <a href="https://www.danclarke.com/2020-more-succinct-csharp">excellent post</a> by Dan Clarke. In it, Dan describes some techniques that newer versions of C# have introduced and how you can utilise them to write more succinct code. The rewrites Dan has done generally have similar qualities to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making code more expression-oriented</li>
<li>Make code more declarative</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've done any work with functional programming or read some of the other posts on this site, you'll know that these are also common qualities of FP code, too. So, I decided to try to replicate the samples that Dan has created in idomatic F# in order to see where both the similarities <em>and</em> differences are.</p>
<p>The first five points are dealt with here; five more will be covered in the next post. </p>
<h2>1. Amazing Pipelines!</h2>
<p>C#3 introduced LINQ - a way to create declarative "pipelines" of transformations and operations over collections of data as an alternative to imperative for and while loops.</p>
<pre><code>myList
    <span>.</span><span>Where</span><span>(</span>x <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> x<span>.</span>SomeProperty <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>OrderBy</span><span>(</span>x <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> x<span>.</span>SomeOtherProperty<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>ToList</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>LINQ has its roots in functional programming and unsurprisingly, the defacto way of performing transformations in F# is by "piping" data from one transformation to another, very much like LINQ. Unlike C# however, which simulates this kind of model through extension methods, F# supports pipelining through <em>partially applied functions</em>, which in effect means that <em>any</em> function can become an "extension" function.</p>
<pre><code>myList
<span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> List<span>.</span>filter <span>(</span><span>fun</span> x <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> x<span>.</span>SomeProperty <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span>
<span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> List<span>.</span>sortBy <span>(</span><span>fun</span> x <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> x<span>.</span>SomeOtherProperty<span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see here, F#'s <code>List</code> (and <code>Seq</code> and <code>Array</code>) module contains operations that are very similar to those in LINQ. And since F# runs on .NET, if you really want to, you are free to use LINQ methods directly on F# collections (since all core F# collections implement <code>IEnumerable</code>).</p>
<h2>2. Everything is an expression</h2>
<p>C# introduced the notion of "expression bodied members" - in effect, a lightweight form of method declaration on classes.</p>
<pre><code><span>int</span> <span>GetSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>123</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>However, they are somewhat limited:</p>
<ol>
<li>You cannot create entire code blocks. Only one expression (or statement!) can be executed.</li>
<li>Somewhat interestingly, they also allow you to return <code>void</code> - which seems to go against the notion of an expression!</li>
</ol>
<p>In F#, pretty much everything is an expression - even <code>void</code> doesn't really exist. Functions have a very lightweight syntax, which uses type inference to automatically determine the return type (although you can explicitly provide the type if you desire). In effect, everything function in F# is expression-bodied.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> getSomething <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>123</span></code></pre>
<p>Needless to say, F# functions allows you to declare multiple values and execute multiple expressions within them (although you must return a single expression at the end of the function!).</p>
<p>Here's another example:</p>
<pre><code>IEnumerable<span>&lt;</span>OrderItem<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetOrderItems</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> orderId<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span>
    _orderRepository<span>.</span><span>GetOrderItems</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>Where</span><span>(</span>x <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> x<span>.</span>OrderId <span>==</span> orderId<span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>ToList</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Here's, more-or-less, the F# equivalent:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> getOrderItems orderId <span>=</span>
    _orderRepository<span>.</span><span>GetOrderItems</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> Seq<span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>fun</span> x <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> x<span>.</span>OrderId <span>=</span> orderId<span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> Seq<span>.</span>toList</code></pre>
<p>In the F# example above, I have left the <code>_orderRepository</code> as some kind of captured field (as per the C# example), although typically you might not see this very often - instead, you might pass the <code>orderRepository</code> as an argument to the <code>getOrderItems</code> function (or simply the <code>_orderRepository.GetOrderItems</code> method!). To be honest, taken to it's logical conclusion you would probably factor the two functions out: one that <em>loads</em> orders and another that <em>filters</em> them. Here's how that might look:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> getOrderItems orderId orderItems <span>=</span> 
    orderItems
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> Seq<span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>fun</span> x <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> x<span>.</span>OrderId <span>=</span> orderId<span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> Seq<span>.</span>toList

<span>let</span> myOrders <span>=</span> orderRepository<span>.</span>GetOrderItems <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> getOrderItems <span>42</span></code></pre>
<h2>3. Conditional expressions</h2>
<p>C# supports a ternary conditional expression using the <code>?</code> and <code>:</code> operators.</p>
<pre><code><span>var</span> foo <span>=</span> bar <span>!=</span> <span>null</span> <span>?</span> bar <span>:</span> <span>"default"</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>In my experience, it is somewhat atypical to use it in everyday C# - most developers will use an if / then statement instead. However, statements introduce several classes of bugs that are simply not possible with expressions, so expressions should normally be preferred. In F#, there is no ternary operator because it's not required: if / then <em>is itself an expression</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> foo <span>=</span> <span>if</span> bar <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>null</span> <span>then</span> bar <span>else</span> <span>"default"</span></code></pre>
<p>It's somewhat more verbose than <code>?</code> and <code>:</code> but is not an issue in my experience (especially given how normally pattern matching is preferable to if / then in F#).</p>
<h3>A word on null in F#</h3>
<p>At this point it's worth pointing out that F# has a different approach to dealing with nulls than in C# (even compared to C#8). So whilst the code above compiles, you generally won't see it in everyday F#. Instead, F# provides the <code>Option</code> type, which is an actual type that provides not only a clearer signal of intent, but also provides extra type safety. For example, if we imagine that <code>bar</code> above was actually an <code>Option&lt;string&gt;</code> rather than simply a <code>string</code>, and replaced the comparison above, the code wouldn't even compile:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> foo <span>=</span>
    <span>if</span> bar <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span> None <span>then</span> bar
    <span>else</span> <span>"default"</span> </code></pre>
<p>Because <code>bar</code> is <code>Option&lt;string&gt;</code> and not just <code>string</code>, the <code>else</code> branch must <em>also</em> return an <code>Option&lt;string&gt;</code> (in this case, <code>Some "default"</code>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're wondering why F# can't "magically" wrap "default" in an option (as C# does with Nullables), this is because F# basically avoids <em>any kind</em> of implicit conversions. This may sound painful, but it greatly simplifies reasoning about your code and clearly highlights all types through usage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For completeness, here's how you would "properly" do the comparison above using pattern matching to safely "unwrap" the optional string, whilst providing a default value for the "None" case.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> foo <span>=</span>
    <span>match</span> bar <span>with</span>
    <span>|</span> Some barValue <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> barValue 
    <span>|</span> None <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>"default"</span></code></pre>
<h2>4. Null coalescing</h2>
<p>C# has a nice shortcut operator for this kind of "default" value pattern where null is concerned.</p>
<pre><code><span>var</span> foo <span>=</span> bar <span>?</span><span>?</span> <span>"default"</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Contrary to popular myth, F# eschews the idea of having lots of specific, "single-purpose" custom operators (as is becoming prevalent in C#). Instead, F# has just a few standard operators that are pretty generic, and uses standard library functions for more specific cases:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> foo <span>=</span> bar <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> Option<span>.</span>defaultValue <span>"default"</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You <em>can</em> create custom operators in F#, so if you really wanted to, you could create an operator to perform the same functionality as in C# e.g. <code>let foo = bar &lt;? "default"</code>. In general usage, using custom operators is frowned upon and should be used with care.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>5. Null coalescing &amp; assignment</h2>
<p>Now we start to move into what I would call "opinionated" decisions. The null coalesce and assignment operator allows you to mutate a variable with a value, <em>if that variable is currently null</em>.</p>
<pre><code>_myValue <span>?</span><span>?</span><span>=</span> <span>InitialiseMyValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>This sort of code will send shivers down most F# developers spines! Firstly, it's yet another operator to learn, it's working with null and more than that, it's operating on a <em>mutable variable</em> - something we try our best to avoid in F#. Nonetheless, if you want to do the same, here's how you would do it in F#:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mutable</span> myValue <span>:</span> string <span>=</span> <span>null</span>
<span>if</span> myValue <span>=</span> <span>null</span> <span>then</span> myValue <span>&lt;</span><span>-</span> <span>initialiseMyValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>This is much more verbose! First, we have to use the <code>mutable</code> keyword to tell the compiler this is a <em>variable</em> rather than a <em>value</em> (remember that in F# everything is immutable by default). Then, we create an if branch and use the mutate (<code>&lt;-</code>) operator to "update" myValue with the default value. It's really not nice to look at!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also - notice how despite if / then being an expression in F#, we only supply the <em>if</em> branch here. This is legal since it evaluates to unit (in others words, a side-effect); the compiler will fill in the <code>else ()</code> for us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good example of where F# and C# optimise for different scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>C# makes it easy to mutate data, with custom operators designed to make it quick and easy to do. However, C# doesn't make it easy to work with expressions, or with immutable data, by default.</li>
<li>F# makes it difficult to work with mutable data and is very explicit about this. However, it's very easy to work with expressions and immutable data in comparison.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suppose the closest to this in idiomatic F# would, again, be using <code>Option.defaultValue</code> over an option; this is also aided because in F# we can <em>shadow</em> symbols to override existing usages:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> myValue <span>:</span> string option <span>=</span> None
<span>let</span> myValue <span>:</span> string <span>=</span> myValue <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> Option<span>.</span>defaultValue <span>(</span><span>initialiseMyValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I've shown you a few "like-for-like" samples here in C# and F#. If you're coming from a C# background, hopefully this has given you a little insight into how F# approaches solving some common challenges. Some of these are quite similar to the "LINQ" part of C#, but some more fundamental features have very different solutions. Until next time, have <code>(fun _ -&gt; ())</code>.</p>
