<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-1df7bf5a=""><h3>Hello. My name is Bahiyya Khan and I'm a young woman of colour from South Africa. I make video games and write and my most recent game,&nbsp;<i>after HOURS</i>, is the reason that I'm making this campaign.&nbsp;<i>after HOURS&nbsp;</i>has been nominated for an award at this years IGF (Independent Games Festival) awards and unfortunately, I can't afford to make the trip to San Francisco.</h3><p><i>after HOURS</i>&nbsp;is a vignette, FMV game, that allows players a glimpse into the life of Lilith Gray – a young woman who was molested as a child and suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder as a result. By spending a night alone with Lilith in her bedroom and subsequently, her head, players learn Lilith's story by adopting a double gaze: that of the player witnessing Lilith's story and piecing together why she behaves and responds as she does and to an extent, the gaze of Lilith herself. This is achieved by having access to the voices in her head and the thoughts that respond to those voices. Hand drawn animations over the film serve to provide a more tactile experience of the game.</p><p>Getting nominated for an IGF award doesn’t feel like a dream. It doesn’t feel like anything that I’ve experienced really since I could have never dreamed up something like this happening. My team and I are not what you would call conventional game designers. Myself, Bahiyya, am from an area that is&nbsp;notorious for being a crime riddled ghetto. I’m also a young Muslim woman, the only one I know&nbsp;from my community to branch into video games. Where I’m from, people struggle daily for money and so our parents want us to head into safer, more stable career options so that we can break out of the poverty cycle that the Apartheid government had so expertly fashioned for us.&nbsp;Tim Flusk, a&nbsp;queer person of colour,&nbsp;&nbsp;is the technical lead of <i>after HOURS</i>. Tim was an excellent friend, stepping in to program the game for me when no one else was there.&nbsp;Claire and Abi Meekel are super hero twin sisters and the kind of friends I wish I’d met sooner in my life. I knew that they were incredibly talented filmmakers and asked them if they would like to work on the game with me. Not knowing me and just believing in the message of the game, they excitedly agreed.</p><p>Being a team of marginalised South Africans&nbsp;and getting nominated for an IGF is incredibly surreal. I often feel like we’re kids that don’t know how to swim but bloody hell we’re doing it anyway. I do feel insecure sometimes, like did we just get nominated as a strategy move to show that the IGF is progressive? Who can say.</p><p>I want people of colour, people from the ghetto, Muslim girls, queer people, mentally ill people, and every other person that identifies as one of us to know that they have a chance at a different life. That they can make video games with socially important messages, video games that will allow them to travel the world and video games that will bring wonderful friendships into their lives.</p><p>Attending the IGF awards as a nominee would be fantastic. We would learn so much from other knowledgeable people in the industry and I think we’d learn about ourselves too in terms of renewed passions or new interests within the field of game design. Please please consider donating to my campaign&nbsp;or even just spreading the word. I'm super grateful for it all ♥</p><p>The money will be used for flights, accommodation, transportation and food.</p></div><div data-v-1df7bf5a=""><div data-v-1df7bf5a=""><p><span data-v-1df7bf5a="">Looking for more information?</span> <span data-v-1df7bf5a="">Check the project <a data-v-1df7bf5a="" href="">
