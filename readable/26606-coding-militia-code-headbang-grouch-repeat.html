                In this episode, we'll make things more object oriented, by moving some logic that's present in the request handlers, which in fact should be present in the domain entities, that currently are just bags of data with public getters and setters.

                This past week I had the opportunity to attend Building the Future 2020, an event focused on digital transformation, so I thought about sharing some of the main topics that stuck with me.

                In this episode, we'll take a look at (yet) another approach to organizing data access code, very likely overkill.

                In this episode, we'll take a look at segregating our application use cases in dedicated classes instead of shoving everything into the same service class.

                In this episode, we'll take a look at redesigning an API that has been developed in a traditional layered way, moving to a more interesting onion/hexagonal/ports and adapters architecture (which is apparently very fashionable right now in .NET land).

                In C# land, the abuse of services and DTOs is prevalent. How about grouping data and behavior using POCOs? You know, ob)ect oriented stuff ðŸ™‚.

                "Equals" vs "==" is an old topic, but as it's often times forgotten, there's probably no harm in talking about it again.

                In this episode, we'll go through the main changes required to upgrade our currently ASP.NET Core 2.2 applications to ASP.NET Core 3.0.

                It has recently been a year since I started working remotely, so I thought it could be interesting to share my experience, along with some particularities of my remote setting.

                In this episode, we'll take a little break from the explorations we've been doing in the latest episodes, getting back to fundamentals and writing some really simple unit tests with xUnit.
