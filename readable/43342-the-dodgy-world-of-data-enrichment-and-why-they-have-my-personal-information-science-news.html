My personal information had been exposed online, again.</p><p>My name, email address and information about my work history had turned up in an online database for anyone to find — my details along with those of <a class="external" href="https://www.dataviper.io/blog/2019/pdl-data-exposure-billion-people/" target="_self" title="">millions of other people</a>.</p><p>I received a notification about the incident from <a class="external" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_self" title="">Have I Been Pwned?</a>, an online service that lets me know when my email address is part of a data breach. </p><p>It's far from the first time: There was the <a class="external" href="https://staff.tumblr.com/post/144263069415/we-recently-learned-that-a-third-party-had" target="_self" title="">Tumblr breach of 2013</a>. The <a class="external" href="https://support.canva.com/contact/customer-support/may-24-security-incident-faqs/" target="_self" title="">Canva breach of 2019</a>. And those were companies I'd willingly shared my details with.</p><p>This time, the alert suggested my data had been lost by an industry I'd never heard of — the booming business of "data enrichment". </p><h2>How to find a data breach</h2><p>When cyber security researcher Bob Diachenko found the database he was immediately struck by its scale.</p><p>It didn't have passwords or credit card details, but it was still a "dangerous" trove that could have serious impact in the wrong hands — for targeting people with phishing attacks, for example, based on their background and profile.</p><p>He and fellow researcher Vinny Troia attempted to find the data's owner, but with no luck.</p><p>They did determine, however, that some of the data <a class="external" href="https://www.dataviper.io/blog/2019/pdl-data-exposure-billion-people/" target="_self" title="">appears to have originated </a>with data brokers called Oxydata and People Data Labs (PDL), which offer "data enrichment" services.</p><p>PDL's cofounder Sean Thorne <a class="external" href="https://www.wired.com/story/billion-records-exposed-online/" target="_self" title="">told Wired</a> his company doesn't own the server in question, but a third party could have taken their data and left it exposed.</p><p>An Oxydata spokesperson also told me that while clients are "contractually obligated" to protect what they've purchased, there is little the company can do when it's out of their hands. </p><p>No matter who was responsible, Mr Diachenko suggested the main question remained: "How did they get my data?" </p><h2>The world of data enrichment</h2><p>Data enrichment services take personally identifying information — email addresses or phone numbers, for example — and match it with broader profiles of individuals.</p><p>That could be information about your education level, your religion or your interests.</p><p>It's all calculated so the organisations purchasing their services can know more about you — all the better to sell you things.</p><p>On its website, PDL claims to have data about more than 1.5 billion people, including "resume, contact, social, and demographic information".</p><p>Troy Hunt, who runs Have I Been Pwned, said <a class="external" href="https://www.troyhunt.com/data-enrichment-people-data-labs-and-another-622m-email-addresses/" target="_self" title="">he's uncomfortable</a> with the world of data brokers and data enrichment.</p><p>In his view, many operate on "different levels of shadiness", especially when it comes to how they build individual records.</p><div class="view-image-embed-full"><div class="comp-lightbox" id="lightbox-17"><div class="view-richTallCaptionByline linked"><figure><figcaption><p class="lightbox-trigger">My exposed data seems to have been scraped from LinkedIn.</p><p class="byline">(Getty Images: stockcam)</p></figcaption></figure></div><div id="lightbox-content-lightbox-17" class="modal fade print-hide" tabindex="-1"><div class="modal-dialog"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-body"><p>My exposed data seems to have been scraped from LinkedIn.</p><p>Getty Images: stockcam</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>Some firms may purchase datasets from other companies that got permission to collect it — online retailers, for example. </p><p>Personal details could be gathered from internet surveys that only disclose they share data in the fine print.</p><p>Then, at what he called the more "dodgy" end, information could be scraped from websites against their terms and conditions — from university websites that detail staff contact emails, for example.</p><p>But there's another potential source — other data breaches that have already spilled volumes of sensitive data.</p><p>"Think about Ashley Madison, and hey, it's available to download for free," Mr Hunt said.</p><p>Plenty of data brokers and credit agencies have had data breaches in recent years. Most notably, the <a class="external" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-09-29/the-equifax-hack-has-all-the-hallmarks-of-state-sponsored-pros" target="_self" title="">2017 Equifax incident</a> in which the Social Security numbers, birth dates and addresses of around 143 million Americans was stolen.</p><p>"They've got all of this data," Mr Hunt said of the industry. </p><p>"They very often don't protect it very well. Or they sell it to customers and then the customers don't protect it very well."</p><h2>What can be done about it?</h2><p>Much of my exposed data appears to have been taken from LinkedIn, but that company's terms stipulate that <a class="external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#dos" target="_self" title="">it's forbidden to scrape data from its website</a>.</p><p>LinkedIn confirmed it has no relationship with PDL, nor other brokers potentially caught up in this exposed database.</p><p>According to a spokesperson, the company's investigation indicates that a third-party company has exposed a set of data aggregated from several websites, including information copied from LinkedIn public profiles.</p><p>"This was not a breach of LinkedIn," he said. </p><p>"When anyone tries to take member data and use it for purposes, LinkedIn and its members haven't agreed to, we take action to stop them."</p><p>You can take a few steps to try and protect yourself from such data collection, said Suranga Seneviratne, a computer security lecturer at the University of Sydney.</p><p>He suggested not displaying personally identifiable information like phone numbers or email addresses on publicly-facing websites, for example.</p><p>It's also important to check the privacy settings on the sites you use, as often data about you is simply sold rather than scraped.</p><p>Ultimately, though, Dr Seneviratne argued it's not something an individual can solve. </p><p>After all, this is data you may have willingly shared for one purpose, now being used for another without your knowledge. Until it turns up on Have I Been Pwned.</p><p>"It's quite difficult to identify these service providers, and also quantify and measure what they are doing," he said.</p><p>Rather, we need legal and infrastructural change to protect our data at the industry level. Or stop them collecting it at all.</p><p>Some argue it should be no surprise that data which is already publicly available on services like LinkedIn is aggregated and exposed. </p><p>But Mr Hunt disagrees — his own information was caught in this leak.</p><p>"The average person is proceeding on the assumption that when they give their personal information to an organisation, it will be respected, it will be secured properly," he said.</p><aside class="comp-rich-text-blockquote comp-embedded-float-full source-pullquote"><p>"And unfortunately, time and time again, we see that's just not true."</p></aside><div class="view-embed-full clearfix"><div class="view-wysiwyg"><h2 class="title collectTitle">
