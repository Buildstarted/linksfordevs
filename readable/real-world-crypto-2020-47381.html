    <meta property="og:description" content="All right, if you can all take your&#xA;seats, we&#x27;ll get this&#xA;show on the road.&#xA;All right. So welcome to Real World&#xA;Crypto 2020,&#xA;the now largest IACR&#xA;event focused&#xA;on applied cryptography and trying&#xA;to get academics and practitioners&#xA;in the same room to talk about the&#xA;latest and greatest in&#xA;applied cryptography.&#xA;So I&#x27;m the general chair.&#xA;My name&#x27;s Tom Ristenpart.&#xA;So if you have any problems, I guess&#xA;you can complain to other people,&#xA;but you can, of course, also come&#xA;talk to me.&#xA;Just some quick logistic stuff and&#xA;then I&#x27;ll hand it off to Agelos, the&#xA;program chair, to talk about the&#xA;program.&#xA;Very briefly you&#x27;re in this big&#xA;room, the auditorium.&#xA;And you came in through the doors.&#xA;There&#x27;s restrooms over my right,&#xA;your left.&#xA;And there&#x27;s more food and&#xA;break space and might get crowded&#xA;during lunch. There&#x27;s a whole nother&#xA;room downstairs if you kind of go&#xA;that way. Turn right outside the&#xA;doors here.&#xA;You&#x27;ll see that.&#xA;And also, if we run out of or run&#xA;low on seats here, there&#x27;s a whole&#xA;another section of seats up above.&#xA;That you can get to through the&#xA;second floor and there&#x27;s some&#xA;further breakout spaces that you&#x27;re&#xA;welcome to use.&#xA;Finally, by registering&#xA;and being here at the event,&#xA;you&#x27;ve agreed to our code of&#xA;conduct. You know, we&#x27;re committed&#xA;to having inclusive, welcoming&#xA;event.&#xA;And so if unfortunately there&#x27;s&#xA;any type of issues, please&#xA;don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out to&#xA;myself or the code of conduct&#xA;liaison, Tall Rabine, who is gonna&#xA;be here for part of the conference&#xA;or any of the other steering&#xA;committee members who you can look&#xA;up on the website.&#xA;But I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll have a great&#xA;event.&#xA;Okay. With that I&#x27;ll hand it over to&#xA;Agelos.&#xA;OK. Thanks, Tom, and thanks for&#xA;being here.&#xA;I&#x27;m Agelos.&#xA;This year&#x27;s program chair.&#xA;So just a bit about the stats&#xA;of Real World Crypto 2020.&#xA;We have 38 talks.&#xA;Twenty seven contributed and twelve&#xA;invite it.&#xA;Total number of submissions and that&#xA;contributed part of the program&#xA;were 75 and that was a 36&#xA;percent acceptance rate and&#xA;the breakdown was about 50 percent&#xA;having a non-academic affiliation.&#xA;So almost an even&#xA;split.&#xA;So the classic joke&#xA;here. Single most important factor&#xA;to get here. Got to work in real&#xA;world crypto.&#xA;Just how your work submitted.&#xA;So very important to contribute.&#xA;And we thank very much all the&#xA;authors of contributed&#xA;talks for sending their work&#xA;for consideration&#xA;in this year&#x27;s program.&#xA;So Real World Crypto welcomes&#xA;groundbreaking real world research&#xA;that has been or will be published.&#xA;So we have no proceedings, but we&#xA;also strongly encourage contributed&#xA;submissions prepared solely for real&#xA;world crypto.&#xA;And so with this like&#xA;stopped thinking about the program&#xA;2021.&#xA;For this year we&#xA;have 15 sessions&#xA;with a great selection of topics.&#xA;Plus the prize&#xA;ceremony was going to take place&#xA;today just before lunch,&#xA;as well as the talk session,&#xA;which will be tomorrow.&#xA;As Tom mentioned,&#xA;by attending real world crypto,&#xA;you&#x27;re a member of IACR for 2021&#xA;unless you selected to opt out.&#xA;And for those of you that you&#x27;re&#xA;new to IACR, this&#xA;the International Association of&#xA;Chronologic Research runs a number&#xA;of conferences and symposia like&#xA;Real World Crypto in summer schools.&#xA;If you want to know more about it or&#xA;you want to get the latest, let&#x27;s go&#xA;to the website, www dot IACR&#xA;dot org.&#xA;How many of you?&#xA;How many people are here today?&#xA;So we&#x27;ve actually&#xA;having the biggest real world crypto&#xA;since the beginning of the&#xA;conference.&#xA;More than six hundred forty two&#xA;people are now at the conference.&#xA;And I should say also that many&#xA;of you opted in for being&#xA;members of the IACR.&#xA;And thank you very much for that.&#xA;Bringing actually the IACR&#xA;membership count to the biggest, the&#xA;biggest count ever.&#xA;Final word.&#xA;Real World Crypto 2021.&#xA;It&#x27;s gonna be in Amsterdam&#xA;with Peter Schwab.&#xA;The local organizers and Tom&#xA;is gonna be the program chair.&#xA;So the submission deadline&#xA;for talks is gonna be sometime&#xA;in the fall.&#xA;So those of you are interested&#xA;in participating, please start&#xA;thinking about how you can&#xA;contribute.&#xA;So thank you very much.&#xA;And with this, I&#x27;ll stop.&#xA;Thank you all very much for being&#xA;here. I&#x27;m gonna pass it to Kenny&#xA;Patterson, the session chair or our&#xA;first program.&#xA;All right.&#xA;OK.&#xA;Okay. Thank you very much.&#xA;Just to add one word to the introductory&#xA;remarks.&#xA;This year, you&#x27;ll notice that we&#xA;have many, many sponsors who are&#xA;supporting Real World Crypto.&#xA;I think we have a record number of&#xA;sponsors this year.&#xA;And I think we should just give them&#xA;all a quick round of applause and&#xA;I&#x27;ll explain why.&#xA;So&#xA;we use the sponsorship money for two&#xA;things mainly. One is to provide&#xA;stipends so that students and&#xA;early career researchers are able to&#xA;attend the conference.&#xA;And we&#x27;ve handed out dozens of&#xA;stipends.&#xA;We will be handing out dozens of&#xA;stipends&#xA;as a result of having that&#xA;sponsorship. And we also use the&#xA;sponsorship to keep the registration&#xA;fee low.&#xA;So the registration fee this year,&#xA;including IACR membership, I think&#xA;was around 250 dollars.&#xA;If you go to ACM conference,&#xA;you might be a thousand dollars.&#xA;And here I think even the sandwiches&#xA;are better."/>

<span id="0111"><p>So just a bit about the stats</p></span>
<span id="0113">of Real World Crypto 2020.</span>
<span id="0116"><p>We have 38 talks.</p></span>
<span id="0117"><p>Twenty seven contributed and twelve</p></span>

<span id="0128">the breakdown was about 50 percent</span>
<span id="0130">having a non-academic affiliation.</span>
<span id="0132"><p>So almost an even</p></span>
<span id="0134">split.</span>
<span id="0135"><p>So the classic joke</p></span>
<span id="0137">here. Single most important factor</span>

<span id="0140">world crypto.</span>
<span id="0141"><p>Just how your work submitted.</p></span>
<span id="0143"><p>So very important to contribute.</p></span>

<span id="0151">for consideration</span>
<span id="0153">in this year's program.</span>
<span id="0155"><p>So Real World Crypto welcomes</p></span>
<span id="0156">groundbreaking real world research</span>
<span id="0158">that has been or will be published.</span>
<span id="0160"><p>So we have no proceedings, but we</p></span>
<span id="0162">also strongly encourage contributed</span>
<span id="0163">submissions prepared solely for real</span>
<span id="0165">world crypto.</span>
<span id="0167"><p>And so with this like</p></span>
<span id="0169">stopped thinking about the program</span>
<span id="0170">2021.</span>
<span id="0173"><p>For this year we</p></span>
<span id="0175">have 15 sessions</span>
<span id="0177">with a great selection of topics.</span>
<span id="0179"><p>Plus the prize</p></span>
<span id="0181">ceremony was going to take place</span>
<span id="0183">today just before lunch,</span>
<span id="0185">as well as the talk session,</span>
<span id="0187">which will be tomorrow.</span>
<span id="0191"><p>As Tom mentioned,</p></span>
<span id="0193">by attending real world crypto,</span>
<span id="0195">you're a member of IACR for 2021</span>
<span id="0199">unless you selected to opt out.</span>
<span id="0201"><p>And for those of you that you're</p></span>
<span id="0203">new to IACR, this</span>
<span id="0205">the International Association of</span>
<span id="0207">Chronologic Research runs a number</span>
<span id="0208">of conferences and symposia like</span>
<span id="0210">Real World Crypto in summer schools.</span>
<span id="0212"><p>If you want to know more about it or</p></span>
<span id="0213">you want to get the latest, let's go</span>
<span id="0215">to the website, www dot IACR</span>
<span id="0217">dot org.</span>
<span id="0220"><p>How many of you?</p></span>
<span id="0221">How many people are here today?</span>
<span id="0223">So we've actually</span>
<span id="0224">having the biggest real world crypto</span>
<span id="0227">since the beginning of the</span>
<span id="0228">conference.</span>
<span id="0229"><p>More than six hundred forty two</p></span>
<span id="0231">people are now at the conference.</span>
<span id="0233"><p>And I should say also that many</p></span>
<span id="0235">of you opted in for being</span>
<span id="0237">members of the IACR.</span>
<span id="0238"><p>And thank you very much for that.</p></span>
<span id="0240"><p>Bringing actually the IACR</p></span>
<span id="0241">membership count to the biggest, the</span>
<span id="0243">biggest count ever.</span>
<span id="0245"><p>Final word.</p></span>
<span id="0246"><p>Real World Crypto 2021.</p></span>
<span id="0248"><p>It's gonna be in Amsterdam</p></span>
<span id="0250">with Peter Schwab.</span>
<span id="0254"><p>The local organizers and Tom</p></span>
<span id="0256">is gonna be the program chair.</span>
<span id="0258"><p>So the submission deadline</p></span>
<span id="0260">for talks is gonna be sometime</span>
<span id="0262">in the fall.</span>
<span id="0263"><p>So those of you are interested</p></span>
<span id="0265">in participating, please start</span>
<span id="0266">thinking about how you can</span>
<span id="0267">contribute.</span>
<span id="0268"><p>So thank you very much.</p></span>
<span id="0269"><p>And with this, I'll stop.</p></span>
<span id="0271"><p>Thank you all very much for being</p></span>
<span id="0272">here. I'm gonna pass it to Kenny</span>
<span id="0274">Patterson, the session chair or our</span>
<span id="0277">first program.</span>
<span id="0280"><p>All right.</p></span>
<span id="0289"><p>OK.</p></span>
<span id="0290"><p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p></span>
<span id="0292"><p>Just to add one word to the introductory</p></span>
<span id="0294">remarks.</span>
<span id="0296"><p>This year, you'll notice that we</p></span>
<span id="0297">have many, many sponsors who are</span>
<span id="0299">supporting Real World Crypto.</span>
<span id="0300"><p>I think we have a record number of</p></span>
<span id="0302">sponsors this year.</span>
<span id="0303"><p>And I think we should just give them</p></span>
<span id="0305">all a quick round of applause and</span>
<span id="0307">I'll explain why.</span>
<span id="0309"><p>So</p></span>
<span id="0313">we use the sponsorship money for two</span>
<span id="0315">things mainly. One is to provide</span>
<span id="0316">stipends so that students and</span>
<span id="0318">early career researchers are able to</span>
<span id="0320">attend the conference.</span>
<span id="0321"><p>And we've handed out dozens of</p></span>
<span id="0323">stipends.</span>
<span id="0324"><p>We will be handing out dozens of</p></span>
<span id="0325">stipends</span>
<span id="0327">as a result of having that</span>
<span id="0329">sponsorship. And we also use the</span>
<span id="0330">sponsorship to keep the registration</span>
<span id="0332">fee low.</span>
<span id="0333"><p>So the registration fee this year,</p></span>
<span id="0334">including IACR membership, I think</span>
<span id="0336">was around 250 dollars.</span>
<span id="0338"><p>If you go to ACM conference,</p></span>
<span id="0340">you might be a thousand dollars.</span>
<span id="0342"><p>And here I think even the sandwiches</p></span>
<span id="0343">are better.</span>
