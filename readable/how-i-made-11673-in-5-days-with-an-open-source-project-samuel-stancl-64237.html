            <p>At the end of June, I launched a business-focused extension to my open-source project. <a href="https://tenancyforlaravel.com/saas-boilerplate/">The multi-tenant SaaS boilerplate for Laravel</a>.</p>

<p>The sales completely exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p>$4,980 within the first 24 hours and $11,673 within the first 5 days.</p>

<p>🤯</p>

<p>Here’s the story leading to this.</p>

<h2>Story of the project</h2>

<p>Exactly 2 years ago (June 2018), I was 16 and I decided to start building my first SaaS application. It was meant to be an e-commerce platform focused on B2B sales.</p>

<p>After working on the project for 9 months, I needed to implement <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/what-is-multi-tenancy-why-you-might-need-it-8a0d64f161">multi-tenancy</a>. I looked at the existing solutions (Laravel packages) and they all felt extremely confusing and complex.</p>

<p>I decided to do the naive thing and write my own package. See, I wasn’t very experienced with Laravel at this point. I’ve only been using it since around July 2018. And this was at the beginning of 2019.</p>

<p>The main thing that I disliked about the existing solutions was that they pretty much required that you rebuild your entire application around their package.</p>

<p>That felt horrifying to me — again, I wasn’t a very experienced developer.</p>

<p>I felt like there should be a solution that just works with an existing application. The basic idea of multi-tenancy is letting customers have separate databases. Why would I have to rewrite my entire application for this? Why can’t I just tell the app to use database X after identifying the customer?</p>

<h3>Version 1</h3>

<p>I released v1 of the package in February. It was limited in features, but it fulfilled my needs. I didn’t have to rewrite my app anymore.</p>

<p>The package didn’t get much traction at this point.</p>

<p><img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/tenancy-stars-v1.png" alt="The star count for version 1"></p>

<p>On February 17, it got the first star on GitHub. 3 months later, it only had 60 stars.</p>

<p>And my SaaS wasn’t succeeding either. I decided to abandon the project basically immediately after I wrote the multi-tenancy package. I realized how bad the code was. The product market fit was there, but I didn’t want to work on this codebase anymore.</p>

<p>I started some other projects instead. They of course got abandoned too, after a few months. Such is the life of SaaS.</p>

<h3>Version 2</h3>

<p>In July, I decided to double down on the package. I started working on version 2. It added a lot more features and made it less proof-of-concept-y and more production ready. Fulfilled more business needs.</p>

<p>In August, I created a landing page for the project. I started <strong>treating it more as a product</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wp.laravel-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stancl-tenancy.jpg?fit=2220%2C1125&amp;ssl=1?resize=2200%2C1125" alt="The first landing page">
<small>The first landing page.</small></p>

<p>By the end of August, the project had some 216 stars.</p>

<p>I doubled down on the marketing side of things, got some articles written and by the end of October, the project was at 476 stars.</p>

<h3>Burnout</h3>

<p>At this point, I took a hiatus from the project. I was juggling multiple projects at once and was starting to get severely burnt out.</p>

<p>For the following two months, I got basically zero work done. On any projects. This was the darkest time for me, work and focus-wise.</p>

<p>There’s a positive side to it, though. Experiencing a strong burnout for a manageable period of time is good — if you analyze it well. Teaches you what <strong>not</strong> to do and how much it sucks to be burnt out. After an experience like that, you’ll focus very hard on not getting burnt out.</p>

<p><img src="https://builtwithtailwind.s3.amazonaws.com/237/conversions/tenancy.samuelstancl.me_-featured.jpg" alt="The second landing page">
<small>I finished this period of focusing on the package with a second, better-designed landing page.</small></p>

<h3>The lockdown</h3>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic was a blessing in disguise when it comes to side projects.</p>

<p>Instead of school, I got to stay at home.</p>

<p>In the past few months I didn’t do much work. So working now was actually refreshing!</p>

<p>The timing really couldn’t have been any better. School got closed first week of March. About 2 weeks after I could (and did) legally get my sole proprietor license.</p>

<p>I took on a bit of client work, started making a bit of $ from that, but mostly <strong>I again focused on the package</strong>.</p>

<p>There were some quirks I didn’t like about the architecture of the code. I also didn’t like that the package was making an impression of being too opinionated and not enterprise™ enough.</p>

<p>So I focused on fixing exactly that.</p>

<p>I contacted a person who was interested in me adding some more enterprise-y features back in October. I explained that I’m focusing on the package again and that I’d like to add a lot of things to it.</p>

<p>He was very glad to hear this. We talked for a while and he offered <strong>sponsoring me to add specific features to the open-source package</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let me know if €5,000 is a good price for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was huge.</p>

<p>See, the project was released in February 2019. And there were <strong>no donations whatsoever</strong> until October.</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSJCo55YgQmuVaJCuyfsKmSs23UIemGD3g198A5fvYhSQeMdzBI7NA7z9NEx0VwbNSEYdj_N4uZEsBx/pubchart?oid=1707722928&amp;format=image" alt="Donations between launch (February 2019 and March 2020)"></p>

<p>And even until March, the donations totaled $111.</p>

<p>5,000 EUR felt massive.</p>

<p>This was at the end of April.</p>

<p>I accepted the offer, expressed great gratitude and got to work.</p>

<p>I decided to focus <strong>FULLY</strong> on the package.</p>

<p>I was writing code and documentation all <strike>days</strike> nights long. Quarantine did its thing on my sleep schedule, but I was happy. Got a ton of work done.</p>

<p>Woke up at 16:00, went to bed at 8:00. Every day.</p>

<p>On May 13th (about 2-3 weeks after the donation) I announced a closed beta.</p>

<p>Why closed? Continue reading.</p>

<h3>Competition</h3>

<p>Like I said, there were other packages.</p>

<p>The project that made me create my own package also had a sister package. It was in development for seemingly forever.</p>

<p>However, in May, Spatie — a web development agency that’s very famous in the Laravel world for their open-source work — started writing their own multi-tenancy package.</p>

<p>This made the other project hurry development too. So in May, these packages were being released:</p>

<ul>
<li>My package’s version 3</li>
<li>Spatie’s new package</li>
<li>tenancy.dev’s new package</li>
</ul>

<p>This got stressful fast.</p>

<p>The Spatie package was built on the same principles as my package. Automatic, no changes needed. Except it was a lot simpler version.</p>

<p>That was no good!</p>

<p>Also remember when I said that I was trying to focus my package more on the enterprise-y needs, like flexibility? That’s what the tenancy.dev package is about, to a large degree.</p>

<p>Hence the closed beta. I ain’t showing no code to competition!</p>

<p><img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/tenancy-stars-comparison.svg" alt="Comparison of GitHub stars between the packages">
<small>The evolution of GitHub stars — <span>blue</span> is my package, <span>green</span> is the older competing package, <span>yellow</span> is Spatie's new package.</small></p>

<h3>The boilerplate</h3>

<p>With the beta done, it was time to focus on the commercial product.</p>

<p>The idea was this: Even though the package does all the heavy lifting for you, you still need to implement it. And many apps will implement it in the same way.</p>

<p>So there was a place for another project. A boilerplate with all the stuff you’d be writing anyway. This means customer (tenant) onboarding flow, billing logic, an admin panel, domain management, customer HTTPS certificate management etc.</p>

<p>And it also fit perfectly into my beta. I had a beta that I wanted users to test. I also wanted to build an app that would use the package. This would make me see all the missing parts, from the perspective of a <strong>user</strong> of the package.</p>

<p>This took about a month of half-work to build.</p>

<p>Why half-work? Motivation was slowly disappearing, the beta &amp; new marketing website was out, so competition was sort of taken care of. Also a bunch of personal stuff happening.</p>

<h2>The launch</h2>

<p>I was on a family vacation in Southern Europe. I originally wanted to finish all my work before going there, but you know how IT projects are.</p>

<p>I spent the first week doing fun stuff — working out, walking, reading, listening to audiobooks and podcasts.</p>

<p>But after a week of spending my time completely differently than I normally do, I decided to finish the work. So, I spent 3 days inside the apartment. There was no time to go outside, I <strong>had</strong> to finish this.</p>

<p>I was finishing the package’s features alongside the boilerplate.</p>

<p>The package was ready for release. And so was the boilerplate.</p>

<p>This was at <strong>3 AM in the morning</strong>. I was severely overworked and it was time to write an announcement.</p>

<p>I didn’t have enough energy to send an email, do a Twitter thread, make a launch discount or any of the other stuff. Nor did I have the confidence in my abilities to do it well at 3 AM.</p>

<p>But I was glad I managed to get the marketing site done! In some form anyway.</p>

<p>So I went with a <strong>safer approach</strong>. I announced the release on my Discord server. This way only a small portion of my users saw it and if anything was wrong, I’d manage to extinguish the fire before it got too big.</p>

<p>So I made an announcement and went to bed. I didn’t expect much. I actually <strong>don’t know</strong> what I expected.</p>

<p>But I can say that <strong>waking up to $600 in sales surprised me</strong>.</p>

<p>I woke up, went to the bathroom, and went straight to the computer. Inviting people who bought the project to the private community (no automated process — gotta do that MVP!). Improving the marketing page.</p>

<p>Then I got to scheduling a <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelstancl/status/1277920614670577672">Twitter thread</a> on Hypefury and writing a marketing email on Mailchimp.</p>

<p>Then both went out.</p>

<p>And the sales started coming in.</p>

<p>A lot of them.</p>

<p>A <strong>LOT</strong> of them.</p>

<p>My inbox quickly got filled with tens of emails with the subject line of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New sale of Multi-tenant SaaS boilerplate for Laravel - Standard version</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SaBSah1.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/SaBSah1.png"></p>

<p>I was incredibly happy.</p>

<p>The first day concluded with a bit over $5000 in sales.</p>

<h2>The selling process</h2>

<p>The product was sold in two tiers. Standard and Enterprise.</p>

<p>The difference between the two versions was that the Enterprise version got priority support and could be used by companies with an annual revenue of $60k and higher. This is the same model <a href="http://nova.laravel.com/">Laravel Nova</a> uses.</p>

<p>I launched the product with <strong>two launch discounts</strong>.</p>

<p>A “generic” one, that I haven’t yet decided when it will end.</p>

<p>And a better one, that <strong>only lasted the first 48 hours</strong>.</p>

<p>The prices were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard: $299 -&gt; $199 (generic) -&gt; <strong>$149 (48 hour)</strong></li>
<li>Enterprise: $499 -&gt; $379 (generic) -&gt; <strong>$349 (48 hour)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I think given the sales, I hit the nail on the head with the pricing.</p>

<p>It was pretty affordable for solo projects, while also being high enough for the enterprise version.</p>

<p>My project is in this strange space where there are one-man indie hacker projects on one side of the income spectrum, and huge enterprises on the other side of the spectrum. Very little in between.</p>

<p>I decided on the prices the night before, after thinking about them for a long time. The original price I had in mind was too high for one-man projects and too low for enterprises (they can pay more!). So I went with two tiers which solved the issue.</p>

<p>I was also offering discounts for people from lower-income countries. Sold plenty of copies at $99-$129.</p>

<p>A funny thing is that I thought of this project back in August 2019 and <strong>thought about pricing it at $49</strong> or something. My rationale was that “Laravel Nova is $99 and it has like 849645745x more features, so my project must be cheaper”.</p>

<p>Stupid thinking. Different audiences, higher price because less total units sold. More directly business-oriented niche. Charge more™ paid off.</p>

<p>I used Gumroad for the launch. I originally wanted to write a custom platform that uses Stripe because I have quite a few of Stripe credits. But in retrospect, that would have been a terrible idea.</p>

<p>Now I just pay $10/mo for Gumroad Premium and get charged similar fees to Stripe. Not to mention that the savings from Stripe credits wouldn’t have been more than $400.</p>

<h2>Revenue</h2>

<p>The vast majority of the sales took place within the first week. Now I get around 1 sale a day (at the time of writing).</p>

<p>I underestimated the power of the launch and overestimated the tail end, so this surprised me a bit. But looking back, it makes perfect sense. A lot of people were waiting for it and I made a good 48 hour only deal. Everyone who needed it got it and now it's a tiny bit of passive income.</p>

<p><img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/tenancy-gumroad-stats.png" alt="Gumroad sales analytics"></p>

<p>There was a bit of sales on Stripe and PayPal too (around $800 worth), so the statistics aren't 100% accurate, but they're accurate <em>enough</em>.</p>

<p>Receiving $10k into my PayPal account meant immediately withdrawing it. I've heard enough stories of people getting 5-figure balances frozen and that's not exactly what I'm wishing for!</p>

<p><img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/tenancy-gumroad-payout.png" alt="Gumroad payout to PayPal"></p>

<h2>Lessons</h2>

<h3>Long term value</h3>

<p>Long term value pays off. That's what I built with the package. I didn't focus on any monetization at the beginning. I just wanted to build something useful and only now I found a way to monetize it well.</p>

<p>Speaking of monetizing open-source, here's an amazing blog post by @calebporzio: <em><a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">I Just Hit $100k/yr On GitHub Sponsors! 🎉❤️ (How I Did It)</a>.</em></p>

<p>Ideally I'd like to move to some exclusive sponsors-only content too. This would bring less money right now but more predictable passive income. And focusing on this project sort-of full-time would be great. I'd get to work on my own project — something I enjoy — and people would benefit from the growing ecosystem.</p>

<p>I think rather than trying make a quick buck, you're better off building something with long-term value. Something that aligns with your values. If you manage to monetize it well, you can capitalize on the enormous value you created. You can't do that with get-rich-quick schemes. They don't scale.</p>

<h3>Tiered pricing</h3>

<p>Coming up with a price that would work for everyone and make me enough money was agonizing. After thinking about it for a few hours, I went to <a href="http://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a>, looked at their pricing components and thought: Fuck it, two tiers, one cheaper than I planned and one more expensive than I planned. Standard &amp; Enterprise.</p>

<p><img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/tenancy-tier-revenue.png" alt="Revenue from each tier"></p>

<p>Turns out that was the perfect solution. Everyone could afford it (see below) and the more enterprise-y clients paid more as they should.</p>

<p>I came up with the $60k threshold for Enterprise by thinking that it should seem attractive and communicate that it will save far more in developer salaries, but it also shouldn't be a bigger investment than 1% of their revenue. So 50-60k was ideal.</p>

<h3>Discounts</h3>

<p>Like I mentioned, I was offering PPP discounts. The way it worked was that people emailed me, told me where they're from and something about their company and I cut them a discount on an individual basis.</p>

<p>While the discounted price wasn't that small ($99-$129), I think everyone made a profit by buying it.</p>

<p>The idea is "save you X hours of development time for $Y". And as an extension "save more money than you pay".</p>

<p>There were many kind and respectful people asking for discounts. The typical exchange looked like this:
<img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/tenancy-polite-man.png" alt="Polite man from India"></p>

<p>But I also realized that asking for discounts is almost a scam industry. People coming up with lies after lies to get a low price.</p>

<p>For example: Guy says he's from a low-income country, if he can get a discount. I say sure, if $99 works for him I'll send him a discounted link.</p>

<p>He starts saying that it's for a school project. To which I reply:</p>

<p><img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/beggar-charging-teachers.png" alt="My response to school SaaS entrepreneur"></p>

<p>And his response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'll manage it for $99.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay I guess.</p>

<p>But nothing beats this email I received:</p>

<p><img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/beggar-20-bucks-for-enterprise-license.png" alt="Guy asking for the enterprise license for 20 bucks"></p>

<p>The entire point of the enterprise license is that you buy it if your annual revenue is over $60k and that you get priority support.</p>

<p>And it costs $499 in original price.</p>

<p>$20 🤔</p>

<h3>Waiting list</h3>

<p>As always, a waiting list paid off. The waiting list was the second best source of sales, after the <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelstancl/status/1277920614670577672">Twitter thread</a>.</p>

<p>I had about 400 contacts on my mailing list at the time of sending the email.</p>

<p>I sent another email ~48 hours later about the ending discount. I made sure to mention that it's the last email about the boilerplate — as the first thing in the email, so that people don't get the impression that I'll spam their inbox with this stuff forever.</p>

<h2>The package</h2>

<p>The open-source part of this project — the package — is growing well, has a healthy community and has recently reached 1000 stars on <a href="https://github.com/stancl/tenancy">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>🙏</p>

<p><img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/tenancy-stars-complete.png" alt="A complete history of the package's GitHub stars"></p>

<p>And that's it for this post, I hope it was of value.</p>
