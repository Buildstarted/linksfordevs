linksfor.dev(s) was created because there is too much noise on various sites like twitter, reddit, hacker news, and facebook. 
All I wanted was the links without the fluff. Here you'll find the links without comments and without 3rd party tracking. 
(i track my own stuff and github which hosts the site might be tracking internally) 

~100% the links on this site are automatically collected from various sources that share them. Occasionally, I'll manually add a link if
I think it's worth it. If you want to send me a link you think I should share you hopefully know how to contact me.

I produce "readable" copies of every article I can on this site. All the readble links generated by this site have the `nofollow`
attribute added to them. In addition I have a `robots.txt` that disallows all readable urls from being parsed by search bots.
If you still feel that you would prefer your site not have a copy please [post an issue](https://github.com/Buildstarted/linksfordevs/issues) and I'll add you to the list of
sites that aren't scraped.

In addition, any amazon links are transformed into affiliate links. I don't expect to generate any income but I figure it's worth a shot.

This site is mainly for me. If you enjoy it then great!

That's enough rambling.
