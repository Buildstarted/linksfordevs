linksfor.dev(s) was created because there is too much noise on various sites like twitter, reddit, hacker news, and facebook. 
All I wanted was the links without the fluff. Here you'll find the links without comments and without 3rd party tracking. 
(i [track my own](https://linksfor.dev/stats) stuff and github which hosts the site might be tracking internally) 

~100% the links on this site are automatically collected from various sources that share them. Occasionally, I'll manually add a link if
I think it's worth it. If you want to send me a link you think I should share you hopefully know how to contact me.

Any amazon links are transformed into affiliate links. I don't expect to generate any income but I figure it's worth a shot.

This site is mainly for me. If you enjoy it then great!

That's enough rambling.
