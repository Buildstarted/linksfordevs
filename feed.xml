      <title>Putting a vaccine out quickly, part 3</title>
      <link>https://yarchive.net/blog/quick-vaccine3/</link>
      <description>If anyone had been in the mood to argue with my previous missives
about getting a vaccine out quickly, they could have easily found an
objection.  &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re only addressing testing&amp;quot;, they might have said,
&amp;quot;and the real problem is manufacturing.  It&amp;#39;s fine to test a vaccine
fast, but the real struggle is going to be in the process of gearing
up to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses.  Even most of the
regulatory work deals with details of manufacturing.  And since we can
do testing in parallel with gearing up for manufacturing, and the
gearing up for manufacturing will take longer, we don&amp;#39;t need to do
testing as fast as you suggest.&amp;quot;</description>

      <title>A new coefficient of correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10140</link>
      <description>Is it possible to define a coefficient of correlation which is (a) as simple
as the classical coefficients like Pearson&amp;#39;s correlation or Spearman&amp;#39;s
correlation, and yet (b) consistently estimates some simple and interpretable
measure of the degree of dependence between the variables, which is 0 if and
only if the variables are independent and 1 if and only if one is a measurable
function of the other, and (c) has a simple asymptotic theory under the
hypothesis of independence, like the classical coefficients? This article
answers this question in the affirmative, by producing such a coefficient. No
assumptions are needed on the distributions of the variables. There are several
coefficients in the literature that converge to 0 if and only if the variables
are independent, but none that satisfy any of the other properties mentioned
above.</description>
