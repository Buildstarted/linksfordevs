      <title>The FFT Strikes Back: An Efficient Alternative to Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18394</link>
      <description>Conventional self-attention mechanisms incur quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability on long sequences. We introduce FFTNet, an adaptive spectral filtering framework that leverages the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve global token mixing in $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time. By transforming inputs into the frequency domain, FFTNet exploits the orthogonality and energy preservation guaranteed by Parseval&amp;#39;s theorem to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. A learnable spectral filter and modReLU activation dynamically emphasize salient frequency components, providing a rigorous and adaptive alternative to traditional self-attention. Experiments on the Long Range Arena and ImageNet benchmarks validate our theoretical insights and demonstrate superior performance over fixed Fourier and standard attention models.</description>

      <title>Being explicit about expectations isn&amp;#39;t micromanagement - Michael Bensoussan – Engineering &amp;amp; Leadership</title>
      <link>https://michaelbensoussan.com/posts/expectations-vs-micromanagement/</link>
      <description>Goals without explicit expectations are just wishes. I learned that being clear about what you need from senior engineers isn’t micromanagement — it’s good leadership. Because when everyone knows what good looks like, they can focus on delivering instead of mind-reading.</description>

      <description>LessWrong user dynomight explains how arithmetic is an underrated world-modeling
technology and uses dimensional algebra as the motivating case. I agree
dimensional algebra is fantastic, but there’s an even better motivating example
for arithmetic in world-modeling: linear models for prediction.</description>

      <title>The Efficiency of Vim | bencornia.com</title>
      <link>https://bencornia.com/blog/the-efficiency-of-vim</link>
      <description>I learned to touch type in fifth grade. We would shuffle into the computer lab and open up Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing1. I peaked at about 80 wpm. Today, I type somewhere between 60-70 wpm. If I am writing code then that drops to 40-50 wpm. It bothers me that I can&amp;#39;t crack 100 wpm but what I have come to realize is that text editing is less about typing speed and more about typing efficiency.</description>
