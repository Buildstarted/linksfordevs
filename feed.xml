      <title>Catala: A Programming Language for the Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03198#:~:text=Catala%20aims%20to%20bring%20together,incorrect%20implementations%20of%20the%20law</link>
      <description>Law at large underpins modern society, codifying and governing many aspects
of citizens&amp;#39; daily lives. Oftentimes, law is subject to interpretation, debate
and challenges throughout various courts and jurisdictions. But in some other
areas, law leaves little room for interpretation, and essentially aims to
rigorously describe a computation, a decision procedure or, simply said, an
algorithm. Unfortunately, prose remains a woefully inadequate tool for the job.
The lack of formalism leaves room for ambiguities; the structure of legal
statutes, with many paragraphs and sub-sections spread across multiple pages,
makes it hard to compute the intended outcome of the algorithm underlying a
given text; and, as with any other piece of poorly-specified critical software,
the use of informal language leaves corner cases unaddressed. We introduce
Catala, a new programming language that we specifically designed to allow a
straightforward and systematic translation of statutory law into an executable
implementation. Catala aims to bring together lawyers and programmers through a
shared medium, which together they can understand, edit and evolve, bridging a
gap that often results in dramatically incorrect implementations of the law. We
have implemented a compiler for Catala, and have proven the correctness of its
core compilation steps using the F* proof assistant. We evaluate Catala on
several legal texts that are algorithms in disguise, notably section 121 of the
US federal income tax and the byzantine French family benefits; in doing so, we
uncover a bug in the official implementation. We observe as a consequence of
the formalization process that using Catala enables rich interactions between
lawyers and programmers, leading to a greater understanding of the original
legislative intent, while producing a correct-by-construction executable
specification reusable by the greater software ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Observable Plot</title>
      <link>https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot</link>
      <description>Observable Plot is a free, open-source JavaScript library to help you quickly visualize tabular data. It has a concise and (hopefully) memorable API to foster fluency — and plenty of examples to learn from and copy-paste. In the spirit of show don’t tell, below is a scatterplot of the height and weight of Olympic athletes (sourced from Matt Riggott), constructed using a dot mark. We assign columns of data (such as weight) to visual properties (such as the dot’s x), and Plot infers the rest. You can</description>

      <title>The future of gRPC in C# belongs to grpc-dotnet</title>
      <link>https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-csharp-future/</link>
      <description>TL;DR grpc-dotnet (the Grpc.Net.Client and Grpc.AspNetCore.Server nuget packages) is now the recommended gRPC implementation for .NET/C#. The original gRPC C# implementation (the Grpc.Core nuget package) will enter maintenance mode and won’t be getting any new features and will only receive important bug fixes and security fixes going forward. The ultimate plan is to phase out Grpc.Core completely at some point in the future. This announcement describes the reasons why we have decided to do so and lays out the plan in more detail.</description>

Observable’s mission is to help everyone make sense of the world with data. To succeed, we need to make visualization easier and faster, both to learn and to practice. Less chore, more joy. We believe people will be more successful finding and communicating insights if they can “use vision to think” instead of wrestling with the</description>

      <title>On Incels, Dead Bedrooms and The Hard Problems of Loneliness</title>
      <link>https://residentcontrarian.substack.com/p/on-incels-dead-bedrooms-and-the-hard</link>
      <description>My father’s father was by all accounts a really bitter-hearted sort of person. I say “by all accounts” because I hardly knew him; he had at some point prior to my birth disowned my dad over a matter of money - he wanted to borrow a large amount of money for something my father considered ill advised, and my dad wouldn’t loan it. He wouldn’t talk to him for decades; choking to death from emphysema, his last words to my dad were “Tell him he owes me $50,000”.</description>

      <description>Our long national nightmare is not yet over: The three main coroutine series are now done, although that doesn’t mean I’m done with coroutines. Here’s a map through the main series, at least. There is a direct route and a number of scenic routes.</description>
