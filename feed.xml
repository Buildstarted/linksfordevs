      <title>Transformer Explainer</title>
      <link>https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/</link>
      <description>Transformer is a neural network architecture that has fundamentally changed the approach to
			Artificial Intelligence. Transformer was first introduced in the seminal paper
			&amp;quot;Attention is All You Need&amp;quot;
			in 2017 and has since become the go-to architecture for deep learning models, powering text-generative
			models like OpenAI&amp;#39;s GPT, Meta&amp;#39;s Llama, and Google&amp;#39;s
			Gemini. Beyond text, Transformer is also applied in
			audio generation,
			image recognition,
			protein structure prediction, and even
			game playing, demonstrating its versatility across numerous domains.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I looked how the&amp;#160;Windows UI 3&amp;#160;Figma file components and variants map to styles and visual states in Windows UI but glosses over some of the details of how resources and in particular, Styles, are defined in Windows UI. To cover this in more detail, in this post we’re going to drill ... Read more</description>

      <title>System Design for Entity Resolution</title>
      <link>https://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/system-design-for-entity-resolution/</link>
      <description>Entity Resolution (also known as Record Linkage, Data Fusion, Deduplication etc) is the process of identifying the same real-world entities (person, company, product etc) from two or more different datasets and combining them into a unique “golden record”. This golden record would serve as an authoritative source of truth for all entities in your organization.</description>

      <title>A wonderful coincidence or an expected connection: why π&amp;#178; ≈ g.</title>
      <link>https://roitman.io/blog/91</link>
      <description>Let’s take a brief trip back to our school years and recall some lessons in mathematics and physics. Do you remember what the number π equals? And what is π squared? That’s a strange question too. Of course, it’s 9.87. And do you remember the value of the acceleration due to gravity, g? Of course, that number was drilled into our memory so thoroughly that it’s impossible to forget: 9.81 m/s&amp;#178;. Naturally, it can vary, but for solving basic school problems, we typically used this value.</description>

      <title>Approved Resolutions | Special Meeting of the ICANN Board</title>
      <link>https://www.icann.org/en/board-activities-and-meetings/materials/approved-resolutions-special-meeting-of-the-icann-board-29-07-2024-en#section2.a</link>
      <description>Whereas, on 1 March 2019, the Board took action on each of the 35 recommendations issued within the Competition, Consumer Trust, and Consumer Choice (CCT) Review Team Final Report dated 8 September 2018, as specified within the scorecard titled &amp;quot;Final CCT Recommendations: Board Action (1 March 2019)&amp;quot;. The Board resolved to place 17 CCT recommendations into pending status (in whole or in part), and committed to take further action on these recommendations subsequent to the completion of intermediate steps identified in the scorecard.
Whereas, on 22 October 2020, the Board resolved to take action on 11 of the 17 CCT pending recommendations, as specified within the scorecard titled &amp;quot;Competition, Consumer Trust, Consumer Choice Review Team (CCT-RT) Pending Recommendations: Board Action on 11 Recommendations&amp;quot;.
Whereas, on 10 September 2023, the Board took action on two CCT pending recommendations as specified within the scorecard titled &amp;quot;Board Action/Rationale on &amp;amp; ICANN org Assessment of Competition, Consumer Trust, Consumer Choice Review (CCT) Pending Recommendations 14 and 15, and Second Security, Stability and Resiliency of DNS Review (SSR2) Recommendations 9.2, 9.3, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 13.1, 13.2 and 14.2&amp;quot;.
Whereas, on 23 May 2024, the Board Organizational Effectiveness Committee (OEC) considered the study ICANN org commissioned to address the Board&amp;#39;s 1 March 2019 request on CCT Recommendations 2, 3, 4, and 5 to &amp;quot;identify what types of data would be relevant in examining the potential impacts on competition and, whether that data is available, and how it could be collected [...]&amp;quot;, and the resulting ICANN org assessment. The study identified that domain name price, including the types of pricing as requested by the CCT recommendations, is just one element that may signal competition in the domain name market. The study noted the potential limitations of studying pricing and suggested non-pricing related data elements that could be used to assess competition and inform the work of the next CCT Review Team.
Whereas, on 18 July 2024, the OEC made a recommendation to the ICANN Board to reject CCT Recommendations 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Resolved (2024.07.29.01), the Board rejects CCT Recommendations 2, 3, 4, and 5, as documented in the Board Action/Rationale on &amp;amp; ICANN org Assessment of Competition, Consumer Trust, Consumer Choice Review (CCT) Pending Recommendations 2, 3, 4, 5. The Board directs the ICANN Interim President and CEO, or her designee(s), to continue to evaluate and supplement existing metrics with additional data elements such as those identified within the study that would be indicative of competition and consumer welfare, as available and feasible.</description>
