      <title>Optimizing with Novel Calendrical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://jhpratt.dev/blog/optimizing-with-novel-calendrical-algorithms/</link>
      <description>I have maintained the time crate for over five years now. In that time, tens of thousands of lines of code have been added, probably just as many removed, and countless more written but never committed. While benchmarks have been present for quite a while, I had never done one thing: truly optimize. Sure, some algorithms have been changed over the years, but I have never created a nontrivial date-time algorithm from scratch. The speed was good enough, even if it was slower than comparable crates.</description>

      <link>https://lgug2z.com/articles/my-first-month-selling-commercial-use-software-licenses/</link>
      <description>I made $901.49 in my first month selling commercial use software licenses.
This $901.49 came from 14 customers, 6 of whom purchased monthly license subscriptions and 8 of whom purchased annual license subscriptions.
January 2025 sales overview My most popular piece of software, komorebi, is a tiling window manager for Windows, published under an educational source license which does not permit any kind of commercial use.
At the beginning of 2025, I started offering dedicated individual commercial use licenses for people who want to use it at work.</description>

      <title>Best Simple System for Now</title>
      <link>https://dannorth.net/best-simple-system-for-now/</link>
      <description>You can have your cake and eat it, as long as you bake it carefully.
‘We can do this the quick way and pay later, or the thorough way and pay now.’ This seems to be a fundamental dichotomy in software development, between ‘perfectionism’ and ‘pragmatism’, but I do not think it has to be a trade-off at all.</description>

      <title>Query Tags: Debugging EF Core Like a Detective - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/query-tags-debugging-ef-core-like-a-detective/</link>
      <description>Imagine you’re a detective working on a big case. You’ve got a pile of clues (queries), but they’re all mixed together with no labels. Which one belongs to which part of the case? Frustrating, right? That’s what debugging EF Core queries feels like without Query Tags. But with Query Tags, it&amp;#39;s like a breath of fresh air, relieving the frustration and making the process more manageable. Query Tags in EF Core are like sticky notes for your SQL. They allow you to label your queries, making it significantly easier to track down problems, optimize performance, and appear as a debugging wizard.</description>
