      <title>Against moderation - John&amp;#39;s internet house</title>
      <link>https://www.johnwhiles.com/posts/against-moderation.html</link>
      <description>When people want to change themselves, their habits, their lifestyles, the approach they usually take is to moderate or attenuate existing behaviour. We take what we are already doing, gently change it in the way that seems the least disruptive and painful and hope that over time we will gradually reach our desired state. We might see that we are physically unfit, and start trying to walk more instead of driving. Or we might realise that we drink too much and decide to try cut down the amount of alcohol we consume.</description>

      <description>Also known as the coolest game ever fucking invented.About two years ago I
started keeping score of who won our Magic games. I didn&amp;#39;t know what I wanted to
do with it, but after sitting on it for 2 years I think it&amp;#39;s ripe for some
initial analysis of my data set. I obviously will keep tracking games, but for
now, I was curious how things were shaping up.

      <description>Training a collaborative filtering based recommendation system on a toy dataset is a sophomore year project in colleges these days. But where the rubber meets the road is building such a system at scale, deploying in production, and serving live requests within a few hundred milliseconds while the user is waiting for the page to load. To build a system like this, engineers have to make decisions spanning multiple moving layers like:</description>

      <title>Warning on lower case type names in C# 11</title>
      <link>https://blog.paranoidcoding.com/2022/04/11/lowercase-type-names.html</link>
      <description>C# 11 is the next version of C# coming in .NET 7, and it is introducing a warning wave that issues a warning when a type is declared with all lower-case letters. This is being done so that in the future the language can begin moving away from conditional keywords and instead use full on keywords instead. The warning is alerting customers to types that may become keywords in future versions.</description>

      <description>The C# nullability features introduced in C#8 help you minimize the likelihood of encountering that dreaded System.NullReferenceException.Nullability syntax and annotations give hints on whether a type can be nullable or not.Better static analysis is available to catch unhandled nulls while developing your code.

      <title>CSS Mirror Editing with Sourcemapped files (Sass, React…) – we need you to make it better</title>
      <link>https://christianheilmann.com/2022/04/08/css-mirror-editing-with-sourcemapped-files-sass-react-we-need-you-to-make-it-better/</link>

It makes tweaking a layout much more convenient than jumping in between editor and browser all the time.</description>
