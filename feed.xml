      <title>When I Realized I Was Not That Guy</title>
      <link>https://kwakubiney.github.io/posts/When-I-Realized-I-Was-Not-That-Guy/</link>
      <description>A discussion about a design question on the DevCongress slack today brought back a very funny but revealing period in my life so I decided to write about it! So earlier in 2022, I had just started diving into the world of low level engineering. Fascinated by all these talks made by engineers who had done crazy things in the CS world, I could not wait to get my hands dirty. At the time I was building Remixify, which did not really do so well, because there was zero promo for it and just when I was about to release it, Heroku took away the free tier and I said flip it. It’s rotting on my GitHub somewhere at the moment. At this point, I was tired of building Remixify, I felt it was not stimulating enough, at the time. Or I was just bored, cause I asked myself, why would anyone want remixed versions of songs on their Spotify playlists in the first place? Maybe a handful, but was not encouraging enough to continue. I tweeted on my account for project ideas, and a friend of mine, Ahornam, sent me a link where someone was trying to build something similar to sqlite, with a well laid out approach and everything. It was written in C, and I barely know C, so I set out to build something similar in Go. I can’t even lie, it was a fun experience. I encountered so many problems when I was trying to port the solution to Go, and also trying to understand what exactly was going on in the tutorial.</description>

      <title>LLMs are not even good wordcels</title>
      <link>https://demian.ferrei.ro/blog/chatgpt-sucks-at-pangrams</link>
      <description>A chat with friends recently reminded me about pangrams, and what a cute little language curiosity they are. I also remembered that i never got a self-enumerating pangram generator to work. I should give that another try! I thought it would be fun play with ChatGPT and see if it could generate some good ones. I expected it to do very well on this task. After all, LLMs should be excellent wordcels, right?That is, they should score high on verbal intelligence. As opposed to “shape rotators”, who have high visual/spatial intelligence. Yeah, i know this meme is kinda cringe, but i honestly find these terms ironically endearing. Well, it doesn’t seem so.</description>
