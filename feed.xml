      <title>Why I’m Writing A Book On Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/504/why-im-writing-a-book-on-cryptography</link>
      <description>I’ve now been writing a book on applied cryptography for a year and a half.
I’m nearing the end of my journey, as I have one last ambitious chapter left to write: next-generation cryptography (a chapter that I’ll use to talk about cryptography that will become more and more practical: post-quantum cryptography, homomorphic encryption, multi-party computation, and zk-SNARKs).
I’ve been asked multip ...</description>

      <title>SemVer Considered Harmful | Joey Lynch's Site</title>
      <link>https://jolynch.github.io/posts/semver_considered_harmful/</link>
      <description>In the past ten years or so, Semantic Versioning a.k.a
“SemVer” has become extremely popular in the software development world. The
idea is that libraries and services can convey information to users about how
the application programming interface
(API) of
that library/package/service is evolving just using the version number. This
information is conveyed through three dotted numbers that form a logical clock
for totally ordering changes to the software API:</description>

      <title>Sundown town - Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown_town</link>
      <description>Sundown towns, also known as sunset towns or gray towns, are all-white municipalities or neighborhoods in the United States that practiced a form of segregation by excluding non-whites via some combination of discriminatory local laws, intimidation, and violence. Entire sundown counties[1] and sundown suburbs were also created by the same process. The term came from signs posted that "colored people" had to leave town by sundown.[2] The practice was not restricted to the southern states, as "(a)t least until the early 1960s...northern states could be nearly as inhospitable to black travelers as states like Alabama or Georgia."[3]</description>

      <title>Scamming the scammers -- catching the virus call centre scammers red-handed</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjKjyMKj3n4</link>
      <description>Follow me on Twitter @troyhunt for more scammer updates.

Ever have one of those calls from the other side of the world where the person at the other end of the phone claims your PC has got a virus and they can fix it up for you? I had one recently and played along with the operator while recording the episode, right up until they want to take remote control of the machine. But it left me wondering; what happens once they get control? So I decided to call them back and let them do *whatever* they wanted while recording both screen and audio.
