      <title>the case for infinite games and functional decision theory – Daniel Frank</title>
      <link>https://danfrank.ca/winning-isnt-everything-the-case-for-infinite-games-and-functional-decision-theory/</link>
      <description>[As an adult, I’ve come to believe that being consistently kind, compassionate, and selfless—as we’re taught in kindergarten or by religious scriptures—is not only virtuous but often leads to the best personal outcomes. While some may find the ideas in this blog to be obvious, it took me a long time to fully grasp and apply these concepts in my own life. The aim of this explainer isn’t to push readers to radically change their entire decision-making process but to gently nudge them towards viewing their actions with a more collaborative, long-term, and pro-social mindset.]</description>

      <description>The day is July 10th, and my boss pulls me into a meeting with HR and lets me know I&amp;#39;m being let go. He&amp;#39;s fired too, and his boss as well, so from the sounds of it, it was just a scorched earth strategy after our department was audited. Time to find a new job. Nothing personal, here&amp;#39;s a positive reference, good luck to ya.</description>

      <description>Did you know that there isn&amp;#39;t just a dumb, simple Windows utility for turning a joystick or game controller into a MIDI device? Sure. you can find 15 year old utilities (that have no docs, so good luck figuring out why they don&amp;#39;t work even if they run), and yes, you can find some dedicated &amp;quot;profile&amp;quot; utils that map specific game controller buttons to specific MIDI outs, but like... I have VKB-Sim rudder pedals because I might like flight sim a little too much and not a minute goes by while I&amp;#39;m sitting at my desk that my feet don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re resting on sostenuto and sustain pedals. Because there&amp;#39;s also a keyboard sitting on my desk.</description>

takes down most of their Windows install base with a poorly tested content
update. Rough day at the office, huh? There are lots of things you could say
about this, lots of reasons it happens this way, lots of people to blame and
not to blame, etc., etc., but nearly every time a major security incident like
this hits the news, you see a lot of people repeating an old refrain:</description>
