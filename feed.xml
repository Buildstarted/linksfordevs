      <title>Safe C++</title>
      <link>https://safecpp.org/draft.html</link>
      <description>Over the past two years, the United States Government has been
issuing warnings about memory-unsafe programming languages with
increasing urgency. Much of the country’s critical infrastructure relies
on software written in C and C++, languages which are very memory
unsafe, leaving these systems more vulnerable to exploits by
adversaries.</description>

      <title>The Myth of the Lone Wolf Developer: Why Collaboration Skills Matter More Than Coding Skills</title>
      <link>http://hemaks.org/posts/the-myth-of-the-lone-wolf-developer-why-collaboration-skills-matter-more-than-coding-skills/</link>
      <description>Picture this: a dimly lit room, the soft glow of multiple monitors, and a solitary figure hunched over a keyboard, fingers flying as they single-handedly save the world through code. Sounds familiar? If you’re thinking, “Hey, that’s the plot of every hacker movie ever,” you’re not wrong. But here’s the kicker – it’s about as realistic as expecting your computer to make you a sandwich when you hit Ctrl+Alt+Delicious.
The Myth of the Coding Hermit
Let’s face it, we’ve all dreamed of being that lone wolf developer at some point. I know I have – there was a time when I thought I could conquer the coding world armed with nothing but my trusty laptop and an unhealthy amount of caffeine. Spoiler alert: it didn’t end well. My code looked like it had been written by a caffeinated squirrel, and my only collaborator was my increasingly concerned houseplant.</description>

      <title>The importance of tech docs</title>
      <link>https://mfbmina.dev/en/posts/tech-docs/</link>
      <description>When I chose to pursue a career in computer science when I was 15 years old, it was basically on liking math and physics. I want to distance myself from writing posts, essays, etc. Time goes by, and now, one of the things that I value at a mature company or team is the existence of technical documentation.
Docs help us to gain historical knowledge of our company, reevaluate decisions, and comprehend the trade-offs between all the decisions.
It is also beneficial for the newcomers because it tells them a story. The richer in detail it is, the better it is.</description>

      <title>Porting SBCL to the Nintendo Switch</title>
      <link>https://reader.tymoon.eu/article/437</link>
      <description>For the past two years Charles Zhang and I have been working on getting my game engine, Trial, running on the Nintendo Switch. The primary challenge in doing this is porting the underlying Common Lisp runtime to work on this platform. We knew going into this that it was going to be hard, but it has proven to be quite a bit more tricky than expected. I&amp;#39;d like to outline some of the challenges of the platform here for posterity, though please also understand that due to Nintendo&amp;#39;s NDA I can&amp;#39;t go into too much detail.</description>
