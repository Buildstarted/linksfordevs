      <title>Cat without cat on the commandline</title>
      <link>https://jarv.org/posts/cat-without-cat/</link>

$ cat file.txt bash: fork: retry: No child processes This post explores this idea and was a feature of this challenge where you needed to display a file’s contents without using any utility outside of the shell.</description>
