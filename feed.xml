      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16574</link>
      <description>A small group of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates
inadvertently formed a longitudinal study contrasting expected productivity
levels with actual productivity levels. Over the last nine months, our group
self-reported 559 tasks, dates, and completion times -- expected and actual.
Here, I show which types of tasks we are the worst at completing in the
originally planned amount of time (spoiler: coding and writing tasks), whether
more senior researchers have more accurate expectations (spoiler: not much),
and whether our expectations improve with time (spoiler: only a little).</description>

      <description>Whiteboard-style coding interviews has a bad reputation, and within the software industry they are being perceived as &amp;quot;bad interview practice&amp;quot; in general. Despite this perception, many companies still hire software engineers through this interviewing process. Are they really that bad? Why do they exist in the way they are today?

      <description>Back in 2019, the personal information of 533 million Facebook users, including more than 7.3 million Australians – which might include you – was stolen by hackers. Now, cybersecurity experts are warning it’s easier for criminals to sort through the data and use it to steal your identity.</description>

      <title>Predictive Coding has been Unified with Backpropagation - LessWrong</title>
      <link>https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JZZENevaLzLLeC3zn/predictive-coding-has-been-unified-with-backpropagation</link>
      <description>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are based around the backpropagation
algorithm. The backpropagation algorithm allows you to perform gradient descent
on a network of neurons. When we feed training data through an ANNs, we use the
backpropagation algorithm to tell us how the weights should change.

ANNs are good at inference problems. Biological Neural Networks (BNNs) are good
at inference too. ANNs are built out of neurons. BNNs are built out of neurons
too. It makes intuitive sense that ANNs and BNNs might be running similar
algorithms.

There is just one problem: BNNs are physically incapable of running the
backpropagation algorithm.

We do not know quite enough about biology to say it is impossible for BNNs to
run the backpropagation algorithm. However, &amp;quot;a consensus has emerged that the
brain cannot directly implement backprop, since to do so would require
biologically implausible connection rules&amp;quot;[1].

The backpropagation algorithm has three steps.

 1. Flow information forward through a network to compute a prediction.
 2. Compute an error by comparing the prediction to a target value.
 3. Flow the error backward through the network to update the weights.

The backpropagation algorithm requires information to flow forward and backward
along the network. But biological neurons are one-directional. An action
potential goes from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals to another
cell&amp;#39;s dendrites. An axon potential never travels backward from a cell&amp;#39;s
terminals to its body.



HEBBIAN THEORY
Predictive coding is the idea that BNNs generate a mental model of their
environment and then transmit only the information that deviates from this
model. Predictive coding considers error and surprise to be the same thing.
Hebbian theory is specific mathematical formulation of predictive coding.

Predictive coding is biologically plausible. It operates locally. There are no
separate prediction and training phases which must be synchronized. Most
importantly, it lets</description>

      <description>Intro From 2017 to 2019, I worked as a full-time engineer and as a part-time recruiter. I made $500k by placing 28 engineers at companies like Snap, Palantir and Betterment. My average fee was ~$30k with a range of $23k-$40k. My split on commission ranged from 30-100%. My recruiting take home was $500,745.</description>

      <link>https://flaviocopes.com/repetive-strain-injury/</link>
      <description>A few years back I went through a miserable period.
My arms, my hands, were a constant source of pain.
I was a computer engineer, typing in a keyboard to make a living, and I was terrified this was the end of my career.
I tried it all. New mouse, new keyboard, fixing the posture, new chair.. nothing worked.
The pain was so bad it didn’t even stop during the night.</description>

      <title>My Struggle With Probability Theory</title>
      <link>http://mitchgordon.me/math/2021/04/02/probability.html</link>
      <description>There are many circumstances in which uncertainty is warranted.1 Gas temperature measurements, weather forecasts, horse races, coin flips, and clinical trials all have some uncertainty involved. Probability theory is the science that finds commonality among these seemingly disconnected phenomena. We can observe, for example, that the summation of many “repeatable” random events, properly normalized, begins to look like a gaussian distribution (aka the central limit theorem). We can notice common shapes in the histograms of these repeatable experiments, such as “fat-tailed” or “power law” distributions. And if the event is not repeatable, we can at least apply the rules of probability theory to avoid inconsistencies in our thinking (which would allow a savvy adversary to take advantage of us when gambling). Many events are unpredictable to us in practice, either because the laws governing the outcome are not known, or because the laws are known but the observations required are too arduous to make. Sometimes the required observations are too numerous to collect (as in statistical mechanics), and other times the non-linear, chaotic nature of the system necessitates observations that are too precise to be practical. Quantum experiments seem to be inherently unpredictable, although whether this is a fundamental facet of nature is a matter of debate.&amp;#160;↩</description>

      <title>Reflections on (roughly) 750,000 words</title>
      <link>https://ethan.katzenberg.co.uk/posts/750-words/</link>
      <description>In May 2018, I stumbled upon Buster Benson’s site, where he discusses the Morning Pages idea and journaling for 750 words. The key idea is that you journal every day, and must write (at least) 750 words, or around 3 pages. I’d been journaling on and off in a paper journal for a year at that point, generally maxing out at one or two entries a month. Trying to bring a little more rigour to my approach was appealing, so I figured I’d give it a go for a week and see what happens. Two and a half years later, I’m still going strong. 1000 days in, here are my thoughts on what it’s done for me, what I (vaguely) expected to get out of it, and what I’ve learned:</description>
