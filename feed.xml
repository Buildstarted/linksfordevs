      <title>Belgium is unsafe for CVD</title>
      <link>https://floort.net/posts/belgium-unsafe-for-cvd/</link>
      <description>This post is about the reason I will probably never try to warn any organisation in Belgium about any vulnerability again. Recently I have been dealing with an attempt at coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) with an organisation in Belgium. This post is not about that, because I’m not allowed to write about it. This post explains why I believe Belgium is unsafe for people trying to do CVD. I believe it’s important to warn others so that they know what to expect and can decide for themselves.</description>

      <title>We've Issued Our First IP Address Certificate</title>
      <link>https://letsencrypt.org/2025/07/01/issuing-our-first-ip-address-certificate/</link>
      <description>Since Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt started issuing certificates in 2015, people have repeatedly requested the ability to get certificates for IP addresses, an option that only a few certificate authorities have offered. Until now, they&amp;rsquo;ve had to look elsewhere, because we haven&amp;rsquo;t provided that feature.
Today, we&amp;rsquo;ve issued our first certificate for an IP address, as we announced we would in January. As with other new certificate features on our engineering roadmap, we&amp;rsquo;ll now start gradually rolling out this option to more and more of our subscribers.</description>

      <description>Last year I wrote an article about how ToListAsync was slow in Entity Framework titled: "Be careful with ToListAsync and ToArrayAsync in Entity Framework Core". Things have evolved since then, so let's celebrate!

      <title>Get the location of the ISS using DNS</title>
      <link>https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/get-the-location-of-the-iss-using-dns/</link>
      <description>I love DNS esoterica. Weird little things that you can shove in the global directory to be distributed around the world instantly(ish).  Domain names, like www.example.com usually resolve to servers. As much as we think of "the cloud" as being some intangible morass of ethereal Turing-machines floating in probability space, the more prosaic reality is that they're just boxen in data centres. They …</description>

      <link>https://mht.wtf/post/aicohol/</link>
      <description>The ethics1 of LLMs is a contentious topic.
I think this is mainly because of the current reach of the technology (it's everywhere),
the hype (people claim it can do anything),
and that it's succesful (it's hard to ignore).
Unfortunately, a lot of things are mixed into disussions around the ethics of LLMs,
and so I've struggeled with figuring out what I think.</description>

      <title>Two And A Half Years In GameDev</title>
      <link>https://smyachenkov.com/posts/two-and-half-years-in-gamedev/</link>
      <description>About 3 years ago, I joined a GameDev company, without any prior experience making games or hands-on exposure to this industry.
Statistically, this time is not even enough to release a single game. But during that window, I was lucky to meet many talented people deeply involved in modern GameDev, who shared with me their career journeys, war tales, and anecdotes, and helped me shape my vision.
One unexpected outcome of this switch was that many friends and former colleagues reached out to me curious about what it was like and how it is comparable to my previous experiences. A surprising amount of them revealed to me that they were secretly planning to pursue this path later in their career, or explore it as a passion project.</description>

      <title>💣Making Explainable Minesweeper</title>

      <description>Many Minesweeper situations that seem like 50/50 luck are actually solvable through logical deduction. Inspired by ‘14 Minesweeper Variants,’ I created ‘Explainable Minesweeper’ - a game that generates only logically solvable puzzles and explains the reasoning in natural language.</description>
