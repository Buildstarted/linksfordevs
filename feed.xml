      <title>Why not rust for security?</title>
      <link>https://cryptologie.net/article/505/why-not-rust-for-security/</link>
      <description>I read a Why Not Rust? article the other day that was quite good but dismissed the most important reason to use a language to me: security. After having worked on a Rust codebase for almost two years now, I thought I would chime in, even though I'll preface the post by saying that Rust is totally the right language you should use if you know what you're doing and are aiming for performance and sec ...</description>

      <title>February 21, 2020 - Blazor and interesting differences from Web Forms</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_q7God8lHg</link>
      <description>Fritz picks up where he left off after the power outage in the prior episode and starts tinkering with the idea of building UserControls in Blazor.  What complexities does that introduce?

17:11 - Never be dependent on a specific person to deploy your code.
24:23 - Had an issue yesterday with a YAML file in my Flutter project it wouldn't build. I was missing a single space.
35:30 - Devil's advocate the target audience for YAML.

      <title>February 25, 2020 - Linux and .NET - Live from Channel 9!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp6moSUReqU</link>
      <description>LIVE from Channel 9 studios at Microsoft headquarters, Jeff is back and talking about running .NET on a Linux-based laptop.

11:38 - Confusion probably comes from the naming.
16:20 - Standard is like interface, and .NET Core is the implementation. Rough explanation.
22:15 - Have you've done some Blazor pages using the MobileBlazorBinding the one that uses Xamarian Essentials?
24:12 - Love talking about non-VS tools!

      <description>macOS is my operating system of choice, but oddly I do most of my professional programming with the .NET Framework. Historically, the choice of Macs paired with .NET would raise eyebrows, but not anymore. The release of .NET Core has made the .NET ecosystem more welcoming of folks with other operating systems.</description>

      <title>Claudius Mbemba - What They Don't Teach You About Fundraising as a Black Founder [w/ASL]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZL9ylxY6XU</link>
      <description>useneu.com has made 3 attempts at raising capital for our business. Each attempt brought with it some valuable, and often unintuitive, lessons about the fundraising process. Join me as I recount our fundraising experiences and the main lessons learned after each one. Should you ever need to fundraise, you'll know the key DOs and DONTs.
---
Claudius Mbemba was born in Cameroon, Africa to hard-working blue-collar parents who taught him the value of hard work, being a self-starter, and always learning. Immigrating to the US at the age of 7, Claudius saw how technology vastly improved the lives of Americans. It was then his love for technology was born. Following high school, Claudius pursued his Bachelors Degree in Computer Science while on the Varsity Football team at The Ohio State University. Upon completing his degree he accepted employment at Microsoft in Seattle, WA where he worked as a Software Engineer, largely focusing his time on Voice, Mobile, Cloud, Bots, DevOps, ML/AI, &amp; Blockchain. Claudius is currently CTO of Neu Inc, a startup building a marketplace that provides automated hotel-grade turnovers for Airbnb/vacation rentals.

      <description>This is part 3 of a series of posts I’m writing for Friendo, a web person who wants to get their hands a lot dirtier with Node and Postgres. You can read part 1 here, and part 2 here, where we say hello to Postgres and learn how to use it with Node.</description>

      <title>Laid off, now what?</title>
      <link>https://bharathpbhat.github.io/2020/09/19/laid-off-now-what.html</link>
      <description>As an immigrant on an H1B, you have exactly 60 days to find a new job when you are laid-off. This is a very short window of time to explore and land any job, let alone a job that matches your skills and interests. I found myself in this situation along with many others when Uber announced layoffs earlier this year. The following is a recollection of some things that worked well for me during my eventually successful job hunt.</description>

      <title>Valerie Phoenix - Empowered By Imposter Syndrome [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk5Kd_dBz9w</link>
      <description>Imposter syndrome is something that the industry continues to represent as a negative. My take on this as a black woman in tech is we need to turn all of our disadvantages into growth opportunities. Adding structure to our learning path is the best way of removing the negative image of feeling like an imposter and allows us to flourish.

      <title>Secrets I use to becoming a better remote developer</title>
      <link>https://mateusfreira.github.io/@mateusfreira-secrets-to-becoming-a-better-remote-developer/</link>
      <description>I have been working as a remote developer fulltime, for the last five years. Part-time/freelancing for at least ten years, over this time, I have collected several tips and tricks on how to become better at it and how to succeed and deliver results under this environment. I am writing this post to share some of these tricks, while this is a brief list. I am always testing these things. I thought it would be useful to do this one and periodically create a new one to share some updates.

      <title>MEAN Stack Considered Harmful</title>
      <link>https://jamesdunne.dev/posts/mean-stack/</link>
      <description>The MEAN stack is everywhere.
Proponents promise getting started is easy.
Hundreds of boot camps provide crash courses promising a MEAN stack job. You don’t owe them until you get hired. No win, no fee.
Developers write thousands of words teaching the stack, preaching the benefits. Become a “full stack developer” in as little as twelve weeks.
It’s adored by greenfield developers. They can build new projects fast. And move on even faster.</description>

      <title>How Do Neobanks Make Money?</title>
      <link>https://blog.mattheakis.com/how_do_neobanks_make_money/</link>
      <description>Neobanks are on a tear and users are loving them. Neobanks are online-only banks, typically funded by venture capital, that piggy-back on top of an existing institution’s banking license and offer a way for customers to store/spend money. Examples include Revolut, Nubank, Chime, Simple, N26, and more. They have a real shot at becoming the mainstream banking choice for customers over the next decade. Nubank, the most popular neobank in Brazil, recently announced that they have 15 million customers. For reference, Wells Fargo has 22 million active users on its mobile app. Neobanks are a rising force and key in understanding where the financial services industry is headed.</description>

      <title>Remote Build Execution</title>
      <link>https://kousiktn.github.io/posts/2020-09-20-remote-build-execution/</link>
      <description>Remote Build Execution - An Overview One of the big benefits of using build systems like Bazel is that it supports remote-execution and caching of the build out of the box. Each action in the build graph can be executed on a remote machine, cached and then downloaded onto the local machine. When there are multiple developers on the team (or you are re-building your project from scratch on a different machine), and if the build has already been run by a developer in the team, then the other developers can simply reuse the results of the previous build thereby reducing the build time and load on the their local machines.</description>
