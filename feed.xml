      <title>How we migrated Dropbox from Nginx to Envoy</title>
      <link>https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/how-we-migrated-dropbox-from-nginx-to-envoy</link>
      <description>In this blogpost we’ll talk about the old Nginx-based traffic infrastructure, its pain points, and the benefits we gained by migrating to Envoy. We’ll compare Nginx to Envoy across many software engineering and operational dimensions. We’ll also briefly touch on the migration process, its current state, and some of the problems encountered on the way.</description>

      <description>Well, it finally happened. Despite the added assurances of working with containers and Kubernetes, the old “It works on my machine” scenario reared its ugly head in my .NET Core (C#) code.

      <title>Integration testing your Polly policies with HttpClient Interception</title>
      <link>http://josephwoodward.co.uk/2020/07/integration-testing-polly-policies-httpclient-interception</link>
      <description>In my previous post I introduced HttpClientInterception, a hugely versatile .NET library that I've had great success with. In the post I demonstrated how you can use it to stub remote HTTP service dependencies within your application to ease testing. Towards the end of the post I demonstrated how it integrated with IHttpClientFactory via the IHttpMessageHandlerBuilderFilter interface, enabling you to apply additional HttpMessageHandlers to your HttpClients generated via IHttpClientFactory.</description>

      <title>Cat without cat on the commandline</title>
      <link>https://jarv.org/posts/cat-without-cat/</link>
      <description>Say you want to display the contents of a file on the command line. The first tool we most of us reach for is cat, which does a fine job at just this. But what happens when you are on a Linux machine and when you try to cat a file this happens:
$ cat file.txt -bash: cat: command not found or even:
$ cat file.txt bash: fork: retry: No child processes This post explores this idea and was a feature of this challenge where you needed to display a file’s contents without using any utility outside of the shell.</description>

      <title>Azure Functions On macOS With JetBrains Rider</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/azure-functions-on-macos-with-jetbrains-rider</link>
