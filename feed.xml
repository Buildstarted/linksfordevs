      <title>Looking Back at Postgres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01973</link>
      <description>This is a recollection of the UC Berkeley Postgres project, which was led by
Mike Stonebraker from the mid-1980's to the mid-1990's. The article was
solicited for Stonebraker's Turing Award book, as one of many
personal/historical recollections. As a result it focuses on Stonebraker's
design ideas and leadership. But Stonebraker was never a coder, and he stayed
out of the way of his development team. The Postgres codebase was the work of a
team of brilliant students and the occasional university "staff programmers"
who had little more experience (and only slightly more compensation) than the
students. I was lucky to join that team as a student during the latter years of
the project. I got helpful input on this writeup from some of the more senior
students on the project, but any errors or omissions are mine. If you spot any
such, please contact me and I will try to fix them.</description>

      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip267.html</link>
      <description>The Microsoft Bot Framework is an open-source framework that enables you to create intelligent, conversational bots that can use Azure Cognitive Services and can run on the Azure Bot Service.
You can create bots with the Bot Framework SDK which is available for several programming languages. And now, you can use the Bot Framework Composer tool to visually create bots.</description>

      <title>Basecamp’s founders are trying to start an email rebellion</title>
      <link>https://www.protocol.com/hey-email</link>
      <description>Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson spent two decades telling anyone who would listen that remote work really could work. Now that a pandemic proved them right, they're shouting about email instead.</description>

      <title>Holy Post -  Race in America</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGUwcs9qJXY</link>
      <description>We need to talk about race. Why are people angry? Why so upset? Didn't we elect a black president? Pass civil rights laws? Isn't racism illegal now?

Why are people still angry? Let's take a look at race in America...</description>

      <title>DeepFakes used in Animations - A New Way of Animating?</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qWUVi52yY</link>
      <description>I used First Order Motion Model for Image Animation, which is similar to DeepFake AIs, but it can do more like tracking motions and copying them onto another target. I feel like this can make creating anything for anime, games, or films a lot easier. The easier is to do something, the overall standard will increase. Looking forward to a lot of good games, movies and anime in the future!
