      <title>Top Free Tools for .NET Web API Load Testing and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://ardalis.com/top-free-tools-dotnet-webapi-load-testing-benchmarking/</link>
      <description>Load testing is an important step in ensuring that a .NET web API application performs well under heavy traffic. There are several free and open-source tools available for load testing, such as Apache JMeter, Gatling, LoadUI, Siege, and Apache Bench (ab). Additionally, for microbenchmarking specific code segments, Benchmark.NET is a useful tool. It is important to choose the right tool based on the load testing scenario, and understand the limitations of each tool before using it.</description>

      <title>The shrinking role of semaphores</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/928026/</link>
      <description>The kernel&amp;#39;s handling of concurrency has changed a lot over the years.  In
2023, a kernel developer&amp;#39;s toolkit includes tools like completions, highly
optimized mutexes, and a variety of lockless
algorithms.  But, once upon a time, concurrency control came down to
the use of simple semaphores; a discussion on a small change to the
semaphore API shows just how much the role of semaphores has changed over
the course of the kernel&amp;#39;s history.</description>

      <title>Back to a senior engineer</title>
      <link>https://mkuthan.github.io/blog/2023/04/24/back-to-senior-engineer/</link>
      <description>I started my professional software engineer career around the year 2000. For the next 14 years I was in an individual contributor role. When I joined Allegro in 2014 I had a choice: be a senior software engineer or become a team leader. I wanted to try something new and I started working as a team leader. After 9 years I decided to go back to a senior engineering role. If you are curious why I made such step, read on &amp;#128512;</description>

      <title>The “const” Deception</title>
      <link>https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/the-const-deception/</link>
      <description>The “const” keyword in JavaScript is used to create constants, variables that can&amp;#39;t change. Curiously, though, we do seem to be able to edit objects and arrays that are created using “const”. In this tutorial, we&amp;#39;re going to dig into the incredibly-important distinction between “assignment” and “mutation” in JavaScript.</description>

      <title>Local license key verification - Theory</title>
      <link>https://matradomski.com/posts/local_license_key_verification_theory/</link>
      <description>If you’ve ever entered a license key for software activation you might’ve experienced the software verify the validity of the key without the need for internet connection. The most popular example would be a Windows installation, during that time your computer most likely does not have the necessary drivers to be connected to the internet. This was for sure more true in the era of Windows XP, but the installation still has the ability to accept a key without an Ethernet cable plugged in to this day.</description>
