      <title>LINQ: Select.Where or Where.Select?</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/57ed9867-4afd-4d02-9f35-e0941bc6f715</link>
      <description>LINQ is a very powerful tool for querying data. As the majority of functions are built on top of IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; and it, in most cases returns IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; as well, it is very easy to chain multiple functions together. That leaves you with a question: which one should I use, Select.Where or Where.Select?

      <title>.NET Rocks! Going Full Time on Open Source with Shaun Walker</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1852</link>
      <description>Can you quit your job and work full-time on your open-source project? Carl and Richard talk to Shaun Walker about his recent move to focus on Oqtane, the open-source application framework and CMS he has been developing for the past few years. Shaun talks about recognizing when an open-source project has matured to the point that it is being held back by not also providing a commercial license. For some folks, a commercial license is not an option - they need it to be able to use the software within the company. Then comes the tricky part: Setting up a business, and balancing the needs of the open-source community with the commercial customers. It isn&amp;#39;t easy, but it can be done!</description>

      <description>Stress I’ve been meaning to jot down my thoughts on this for a while, but I keep running into things that tweak my mental model about stress.
Recently, I watched some old home videos. Twenty years ago, my parents moved us into the home we still live in today. Around this time, my dad filmed a video of my brother and I walking the quarter mile from our house to a canal that runs through metropolitan Phoenix.</description>

      <description>Shopping lists, class notes, technical documentation, time and place of important appointment - all of these things are difficult to keep in our heads, therefore we tend to write things down. It doesn’t matter who you are and which field are you working in, you probably have some kind of note taking system in place. It could be a physical notebook, a pile of post-it notes, the default ’notes’ app in your phone or perhaps more sophisticated piece of software with advanced note management features.</description>

      <title>How to do templates properly</title>
      <link>https://me.svin.in/how-to-do-templates-properly/</link>
      <description>There are numerous templating engines out there. There is:
 Jinja2 - which is standard these days Python’s Django’s templates - which are much like jinja2, but not quite Go’s text/template which claims to be the template engine (hence, the name) Mustache, which is also popular And numerous others  I’ve even recently stumbled upon Calibre’s (which is an open-source e-book management tool) own custom (!!!) templating engine. The fact that I have to learn another templating engine so that my e-books can be placed into folders is insane.</description>

      <link>https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/us-east-1-latency</link>
      <description>Every time I leave New York and land back in Europe or in Asia, I can immediately tell which apps have a global presence and which apps only deploy to a single US region. Everything just immediately feels a little slower. The pull to refresh feels a bit sluggish, the preview images take a little longer to load, and even native apps just feel less responsive.</description>
