      <description>Recently there was a discussion in a Pull Request for the .NET runtime on GitHub.

I never heard of that, and looks I'm not alone: Raise your hand if you knew that.</description>

      <description>When you run an application on the web, it is going to be attacked. Your website will be attacked with SQL Injection attacks, Cross-site scripting attacks and every other attack in the OWASP top 10 and beyond.
You need to protect your application from these attacks and you can do that with Azure Web Application Firewall and Azure Front Door.</description>

      <title>Jim Scheinman TED Talk: The Amazing true story of Galen Clark, the "Father of Yosemite"</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpccXl_B6Fs</link>
      <description>In this short TED Talk, Jim discusses the true meaning of finding one's passion and leaving one's legacy by weaving in the incredible untold true story of one of the key 'founders' of Yosemite, Galen Clark, an early pioneer and failed entrepreneur, who contracted tuberculosis while mining for gold and was told he had only months to live, yet who lived to 96 and is a key reason that we have the beauty of Yosemite to cherish today.  
Enjoy the journey and celebration of this soft-spoken true American hero, Galen Clark, as we celebrate the 150th Anniversary of Yosemite as National Treasure!</description>
