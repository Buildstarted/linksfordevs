      <title>Object Calisthenics #4: Implementations explanations</title>
      <link>https://goatreview.com/object-calisthenics-9-rules-clean-code-explanations/</link>
      <description>The application of code rules is often conveyed as unidirectional and one-size-fits-all. In other words, when we learn to develop, we tend to read that there is only one way to produce quality code, and only one way to implement rules or patterns.

With this series of articles, we aim</description>

      <title>DRY your Apache APISIX config</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/dry-apisix-config/</link>
      <description>DRY is an important principle in software development. This post will show you how to apply it to Apache APISIX configuration.   The DRY principle     &amp;#39;Don’t repeat yourself&amp;#39; (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of information which is likely to change, replacing it with abstractions that are less likely to change, or using data normalization which avoids redundancy in the first place.    — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[Wiki</description>

      <title>How I’ve managed notes over 12 years</title>
      <link>https://tevinzhang.com/notes-over-12-years</link>
      <description>I have a Git repository dating back to 2012. Before that, I remember using Notational Velocity1 with a bunch of text files, it worked well, until I decided to keep my notes for life. If I’m not digitizing them, I’ll write notes on index cards and store them in boxes for organizing. As long as I can keep the boxes, I get to keep my notes. Notational Velocity is a text editor that lets me quickly search and switch between files. Later I switched to nvALT—a fork of Notational Velocity with some additional features and interface modifications, including MultiMarkdown functionality. ↩</description>

      <title>Attention Is The Scarce Resource</title>
      <link>https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/attention_is_the_scarce_resource/</link>
      <description>There are, currently, a lot of high-profile people doing crazy stuff in public.  Saying outrageous things, in interviews or on social media, that we would not have expected high-profile people to do a few decades ago (at least not in public).  Any explanation of this, needs to not only explain why it happens so often now, but also why it hasn&amp;#39;t always been happening.  So, &amp;quot;people are crazy&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;people are stupid&amp;quot;, and that sort of thing, do not work as explanations, because that has always been true.  Why in public now?  Why the most high-profile people?</description>
