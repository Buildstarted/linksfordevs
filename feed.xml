      <link>https://julian.digital/2020/12/21/thoughts-on-clubhouse/</link>
      <description>Clubhouse, for those not familiar with it, is essentially an audio-first social network. It&amp;#39;s kind of a mix between Reddit and a podcast. An interactive radio show. The app lets you jump into different chat rooms and participate in - or just listen to - live audio conversations around different topi</description>

      <title>End of 2020 rough database landscape</title>
      <link>https://stian.tech/end-of-2020-rough-database-landscape/</link>
      <description>There seems to exist a database for every niche, mood or emotion. And they seem to change just as fast. How do you balance the urge for the new and shiny but without risking too much headache down the road? This post is an attempt to lay out the rough landscape of databases that you might encounter or consider as of late 2020. There will be broad generalizations for brevity. The goal is not to be exhaustive or take all possible precautions. Consider it a starting point for further research and planning.</description>

      <description>Though it didn’t garner as much attention as other police reform measures during the special legislative session that ended this fall, a provision to decriminalize jaywalking in a pretextual policing bill from Delegate Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, means that come March 1, police will no longer be able to stop folks for the act of crossing […]</description>

      <title>The San Francisco that Could Have Been</title>
      <link>https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/12/16/sf.html</link>
      <description>I’m running through Lands End. It’s 8AM on a winter day. Cool mist hangs in the air, and the gravel crunches under my running shoes. I’m looking at my Apple Watch, checking the time as I run down the hill, past the Cliff House, looking at the Pacific as it shines in the morning sun like a pool of liquid silver stretching to the horizon. California is good. I hear the waves crashing, and the air softly smells of salt and pines. To my left, I see the Pacific Towers: eight fifty-five story glass obelisks stretching into the sky, all connected by a public park up top, six hundred feet in the air. A marvel of modern engineering, only paralleled by a few buildings in Shanghai. The year is 2030. I’m fortunate to rent a one-bedroom in the Pacific Towers for $2700 a month. I live on the fourteenth floor.</description>

      <title>Toolchains as Code</title>
      <link>http://calculist.org/blog/2020/12/21/tac/</link>
      <description>As Volta hits its 1.0 release, I’ve been thinking about what makes it more than just a Node version manager. I think what makes Volta so liberating is what I’ve been calling Toolchains as Code (TaC): The exact set of command-line tools used for a project should be in git, and should Just Work for everyone who contributes to the project. Specifying toolchains as code instead of manually installing and upgrading frees developers up from acting like their development machine’s sysadmin, and lets them focus their precious cognitive resources on what really matters: building software!</description>

In 2020 my recommendation is to ignore it, because AMP largely appears meaningless now. &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Upgrade Your HTML II&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; gives an opinionated idea&amp;#160;why.</description>

      <title>Azure DevOps Podcast: Scott Hunter on .NET 5 - Episode 119</title>
      <link>http://azuredevopspodcast.clear-measure.com/scott-hunter-on-net-5-episode-119</link>
      <description>Scott is the Director of Program Management for .NET at Microsoft. When Scott first joined Microsoft back in 2007, he was working on the ASP.NET team. &amp;amp;nbsp; As the Director of Program Management of .NET, Scott and his team build .NET Core, .NET Framework, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, managed languages (C#/F#/VB), as well as the Web and .NET Tooling for Visual Studio. &amp;amp;nbsp; In this episode, Jeffrey and Scott discuss the announcements that were made at the recent .NET Conf 2020, everything .NET 5.0, and general advice for .NET developers. Scott also touches on the Experimental Mobile Blazor Bindings project, isolated CSS, browser-based applications, the pre-render server feature in .NET 5.0, and much more. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:38] Be sure to visit  for past episodes and show notes. [1:02] About The Azure DevOps Podcast and Jeffrey’s offer to speak at virtual user groups. [1:11] Clear Measure is hiring! Be sure to check out the link in the show notes. [1:34] About today’s guest, Scott Hunter! [1:51] Jeffrey welcomes Scott back to the podcast. [1:58] Jeffrey and Scott reflect on software and tech history, their job history, and the history of how they know each other. [7:21] Scott shares his predictions on the technology and software that developers should be investing in that were showcased at .NET Conf 2020. [15:08] The two tracks Microsoft seems to be going on and Scott’s thoughts on what the overall vision seems to be. [19:05] About the Experimental Mobile Blazor Bindings project. [21:58] A word from Azure DevOps Podcast’s sponsor: Clear Measure. [22:31] From a labor pool perspective, there seems to be a mountain more of people who know how to lay out a screen and make something attractive using an HTML and CSS combination. Contracting with a designer who only needs to know HTML and CSS is becoming an increasingly affordable option. Is this part of Scott’s thought process? [25:15] Jeffrey and Scott touch on another cool announcement from .NET Conf 2020: isolated CSS. [26:30] Scott tells a fun story about the merits of being on a .NET team and working at Microsoft. [29:59] There’s one paradigm in browser-based applications that doesn’t exist in desktop or mobile applications: the back button. Scott shares his perspective on this and whether or not they’ll be supported in a first-class way. [32:17] Scott highlights another cool feature in .NET 5: the pre-render server. [33:49] Scott speaks about an amazing customer of theirs that they highlighted at the .NET Conf 2020 keynote. [38:09] Is .NET 5 the fastest real programming platform? What would Scott’s recommendations be to a team looking to move from .NET 4.8 to 5.0? [42:47] Jeffrey thanks Scott for joining the show! &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:   (Sponsor)  — Available on Amazon!  — Click here to download the .NET DevOps for Azure ebook!   — Follow to stay informed about future events!

      <title>Extending Android Device Compatibility for Let&amp;#39;s Encrypt Certificates</title>
      <link>https://letsencrypt.org/2020/12/21/extending-android-compatibility.html</link>
      <description>We’re happy to announce that we have developed a way for older Android devices to retain their ability to visit sites that use Let&amp;amp;rsquo;s Encrypt certificates after our cross-signed intermediates expire. We are no longer planning any changes in January that may cause compatibility issues for Let’s Encrypt subscribers.
A recurring theme in our posts about our upcoming chain switch has been our concern over the effects on users of Android operating systems prior to 7.</description>

      <title>How can I emulate the REG_NOTIFY_THREAD_AGNOSTIC flag on systems that don&amp;#39;t support it? part 1 | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201221-00/?p=104574</link>
      <description>Windows 8 introduced the REG_NOTIFY_THREAD_AGNOSTIC flag to the Reg&amp;#173;Notify&amp;#173;Change&amp;#173;Key&amp;#173;Value function. But what if you need to run on systems older than that? One of the recommended workarounds for the lack of support for the REG_NOTIFY_THREAD_AGNOSTIC flag is to do the registration from a persistent thread,</description>

      <title>Arrows born in flight</title>
      <link>https://laenas.github.io/posts/01-fs-primer.html</link>
      <description>My adoption of F# as a language-of-choice was slightly rocky.  After around a decade of nearly exclusive C# work, my curiosity was piqued with an uptick in hearing about this other #-lang.  My initial reaction was one I&amp;#39;ve since seen in other C# developers - dismissal - C# is a good language and I was comfortable with it so why bother with the effort of learning a different one?  But the curiosity remained - and at least a few times I decided I&amp;#39;d set aside an evening to go through a basic introduction post and try to write some katas in F#.  It didn&amp;#39;t stick because I just felt lost and couldn&amp;#39;t translate my experience with C# into feeling even remotely comfortable with F#.  Easy enough to drop the curly braces, a little bit of a hiccup to remember to let instead of var - but how to do what I wanted?</description>

      <description>Redis is one of the good friends of a backend engineer, and its versatility and ease of use make it convenient to get started. That said, when it comes to scaling it horizontally for writes, it gets a bit more tricky with different level of trade-offs you need to make. In this post, I want to touch on the basics of Redis Cluster, out of the box solution of Redis to the gnarly write scaling problem.</description>
