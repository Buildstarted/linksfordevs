      <title>mjg59 | Booting modern Intel CPUs</title>
      <link>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/66109.html</link>
      <description>CPUs can&amp;#39;t do anything without being told what to do, which leaves the obvious problem of how do you tell a CPU to do something in the first place. On many CPUs this is handled in the form of a reset vector - an address the CPU is hardcoded to start reading instructions from when power is applied. The address the reset vector points to will typically be some form of ROM or flash that can be read by the CPU even if no other hardware has been configured yet. This allows the system vendor to ship code that will be executed immediately after poweron, configuring the rest of the hardware and eventually getting the system into a state where it can run user-supplied code.</description>

      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/cda93276-c9ab-42c3-8288-a9b3e5c8aa5c</link>
      <description>Let&amp;#39;s talk about Contravariance and Covariance in C# using .NET Framework examples!
Contravariance and covariance are essential concepts in C# when dealing with generics, enabling us to have more flexibility when assigning generic types. So let&amp;#39;s have examples straight from the framework itself!
Also, we will go a bit deeper and talk what some differences between generic constraints and things like Contravariance are.

      <description>I&amp;#39;ll let you go to the article to read about those non-negotiables, but I agree. I think this is the real problem when it comes to bosses complaining about how remote isn&amp;#39;t a good option. They haven&amp;#39;t managed a remote team; they&amp;#39;ve been managing a team that works outside the office. There is a difference.</description>

      <title>AI / ML / Transformer Models Timeline</title>
      <link>https://ai.v-gar.de/ml/transformer/timeline/</link>
      <description>This is a collection of important papers in the area of Large Language Models and Transformer Models. It focuses on recent development, especially from mid-2022 onwards, and in no way claims to be exhaustive. It is actively updated.</description>

      <title>Using GPT-3.5 to Quickly Generate and Run Shell Commands &amp;#183; Way Enough</title>
      <link>https://www.danielcorin.com/posts/shell-ai/</link>
      <description>I believe that language models are most useful when available at your fingertips in the context of what you’re doing.
Github Copilot is a well known application that applies language models in this manner.
There is no need to pre-prompt the model.
It knows you’re writing code and that you’re going to ask it to write code for you based on the contents of your comment. Github is further extending this idea with Copilot for CLI, which looks promising but isn’t generally available yet.
I’ll describe a tool I’ve created, called “Shell AI” (sai) that integrates a language model directly into the command line interface to generate and run shell commands on the fly.</description>

      <title>Post Information Scarcity</title>
      <link>https://danangell.com/blog/posts/post-information-scarcity/</link>
      <description>In Star Trek humans live in a post-scarcity world. Transporter technology allows for instantaneous and cheap movement of humans and objects anywhere on a planet, and into or out of orbit. The same devices that allow for transportation can also re-organize matter into arbitrary configurations. This means that anything that can be designed can be owned for essentially no cost. What do people do in such a world? As Gene Roddenberry imagined, they explore.</description>

      <title>Alien Artefacts</title>
      <link>https://www.brautaset.org/posts/alien-artefacts.html</link>
      <description>The purpose of this blog post is to introduce the concept of alien
artefacts1, a subcategory of legacy code. I use the term to
describe particularly complicated and important pieces of software
written by very smart engineers that are no longer working for the
company—and thus not available to support it. The software works
really well for what it was designed to do, but it is highly resistant
to change.</description>
