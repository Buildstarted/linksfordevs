      <title>Beyond Token Limits: Why the Apple LRM Rebuttal Misses the Point :: Victor's Blog</title>
      <link>https://victoramartinez.com/posts/why-claudes-comment-paper-is-a-poor-rebuttal/</link>
      <description>Recently Apple published a paper on LRMs (Large Reasoning Models) and how they found that “that LRMs have limitations in exact computation” and that “they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles.” I would consider this a death blow paper to the current push for using LLMs and LRMs as the basis for AGI. Subbaro Kambhampati and Yann LeCun seem to agree. You could say that the paper knocked out LLMs. More recently, a comment paper showed up on Arxiv and shared around X as a rebuttal to Apple’s paper. Putting aside the stunt of having Claude Opus as a co-author (yes, I’m not kidding), the paper in itself is a poor rebuttal for many reasons which we shall explore, but mainly for missing the entire point of the paper and prior research by AI researchers such as Professor Kambhampati.</description>

      <title>Static binaries and Homebrew as a channel for internal tools</title>
      <link>https://leonardoheld.ovh/static-binaries-and-homebrew-for-internal-tools.html</link>
      <description>The Homebrew package manager is nice. It's not perfect, it's not performant, but in my opinion, for developer machines, it's by far the easiest and most flexible package manager, especially for quickly distributing internal tools. The flexibility comes from two main points:</description>

      <title>Working on databases from prison: How I got here, part 2.</title>
      <link>https://turso.tech/blog/working-on-databases-from-prison</link>
      <description>I'm very excited to announce that I have recently joined Turso as a software engineer. For many in the field, including myself, getting to work on databases and solve unique challenges with such a talented team would be a dream job, but it is that much more special to me because of my unusual and unlikely circumstances. As difficult as it might be to believe, I am currently incarcerated and I landed this job from my cell in state prison. If you don’t know me, let me tell you more about how I got here.</description>

      <title>Start your own Internet Resiliency Club – Bow Shock Systems Consulting</title>
      <link>https://bowshock.nl/irc/</link>
      <description>Thanks to war, geopolitics, and climate change, Europe will have more
frequent and more severe internet
disruptions
in the very near future. Governments and businesses need to prepare
for catastrophic loss of communications. Unfortunately, the necessary
changes are risky and expensive, which means they won’t do it until a
crisis is already here. However, small
groups of volunteers with a little bit of time and money can provide
crucial initial leadership to bootstrap recovery.</description>
