      <title>Dysgraphia or: can a MNIST-trained ResNet read my clinically atrocious handwriting?</title>
      <link>https://timbrell.dev/ai/2024/09/02/can-mnist-resnet-read-my-handwriting.html</link>
      <description>When I was 11 years old I was told I had a learning disability called Dysgraphia, although it’s now called “an impairment in written expression” by the DSM-5. This wasn’t a surprise given my handwriting was pretty bad, writing even the slightest bit legibly took forever, and by the 4th grade I was already starting to lose points on assignments because I’d lose track of what I had written. Thankfully, a middle school guidance counselor was reasonably well read on it and got me an accommodation to use my laptop for notes, assignments, and tests.</description>

      <description>For the past year, Obsidian has been my note-taking companion. I&amp;#39;ve slowly grown towards a more consistent way of taking and organizing notes: it&amp;#39;s a system that can easily be ported to any other tool as long as you have something that resembles a filesystem.</description>

      <title>PHP is the Best Choice for Long&amp;amp;#8209;Term Business</title>
      <link>https://tomasvotruba.com/blog/php-is-the-best-choice-for-long-term-business/</link>
      <description>Recently, I listened to Lex Friedman&amp;#39;s [podcast with Pieter Levels](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6KBpL2XfR9VdojbKNpE7cX). Pieter talked about his technology stack for building startups: vanilla PHP, jQuery, and SQLite.

Hype is exciting, but there is no better technology proof than long-term usage by sustainable business.

The podcast inspired me to write my views about why PHP is the best choice for long-term.

      <title>How to build an alternate Django admin in only 10 years</title>
      <link>https://kodare.net/2024/09/03/admin-replacement.html</link>
      <description>In “So you want a new admin?” Jacob Kaplan-Moss writes about the cost and manpower it took to design the Django Admin system. TLDR: The original version was built by a team of 5 people working tightly with users for over a year, then it has been polished for over a decade after that. He estimates $1 million dollars to design a new one.</description>

      <title>Roughly Everything You Need to Know About Entity Resolution</title>
      <link>https://faingezicht.com/articles/2024/09/03/entity-resolution/?src=hn</link>
      <description>Naming things is hard. This is not just a technical problem, but a foundational problem that we have as humans when we talk to each other and refer to specific things and people. I have four good friends named Zach – there’s a reason we invented nicknames. Leaning on my experience designing the data pipelines that created and maintained Vouch’s knowledge graph of the startup ecosystem, in this blog post, I’ll discuss some of the key ideas behind ER systems, and the challenges in building them. </description>

      <description>The application of code rules is often conveyed as unidirectional and one-size-fits-all. In other words, when we learn to develop, we tend to read that there is only one way to produce quality code, and only one way to implement rules or patterns.
