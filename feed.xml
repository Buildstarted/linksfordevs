      <title>OpenAI Dall-E 2</title>
      <link>https://msapaydin.github.io/2022/08/19/fourth_post.html</link>
      <description>I was awarded access to the AI based image generation tool from OpenAI called Dall-E 2. It accepts as input detailed text and generates an image corresponding to the text. It is similar in spirit to OpenAI codex which accepts also a text string and generates code that is given in the query. As such, a new area of work called “prompt engineering” arose, which consists of finding the right prompt to generate the desired piece of code or the desired image.</description>

      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/renovate-alternative-dependabot/</link>
      <description>I won’t introduce Dependabot. Lots and lots of developers use it daily on GitHub. I do use it as well. However, it suffers from two drawbacks: While it’s perfectly integrated with GitHub, integrations with other platforms are less seamless.It’s limited in the list of ecosystems it supports For example, I generally use Docker Compose files for my demos. When necessary, I use Kubernetes. Dependabot supports none. Worse, Dependabot doesn’t accept contributions to add new eco</description>

      <description>I’d like to show you how I use Tailscale and a Mac mini in my office to achieve some nifty things.
Tailscale is marketed as a zero-config VPN built on top of WireGuard that securely connects devices and manages firewall rules etc. While all of that might be true, think of it this way: Tailscale allows you to securely connect to a machine at home from anywhere on the internet.</description>

      <description>Nearly everyone in the software industry has an idea or side project that they want to take “all the way”. I had dozens of ideas, and even hacked on a couple projects here and there. But, the constraints of a career always took precedence. Sometimes it was the employer owning any potential IP, completely forbidding moon lighting, or just not having anything left to give after a hard week of work.</description>

      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Iris Classon to chat all about her book - The Unlikely Success of a Copy Paste Developer. The book is a very fun, light-hearted, fictional novel about a software developer called Leo, and a range of very interesting characters Leo has to work with. I’ve recently read the book, and thoroughly enjoyed it. As a software developer, a lot of the stories are very relatable!</description>
