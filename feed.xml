      <title>DIY lighted arrow nocks</title>
      <link>https://tegowerk.eu/posts/nocks/</link>
      <description>But first, a demo! Click the image to see the full-size (potato-quality) clip:
Winter is coming. I normally visit my club’s 3D archery range either early in the morning before work, or in the evening after, but with the lengthening dark it’s getting harder and harder to spot my arrows in the targets1. Lighted nocks to the rescue!
Component-wise, a lighted nock is just an LED and a battery inserted in an ordinary transparent nock, but the trick is getting the LED to turn on only upon release, so that you don’t walk through the forest looking like a Christmas tree, but also to conserve batteries.</description>

      <link>https://www.akshaykhot.com/notes-on-refactoring/</link>
      <description>I recently re-read Martin Fowler&amp;#39;s excellent book on refactoring. It&amp;#39;s about improving the design and quality of your code in small steps, without changing external behavior. The book contains detailed descriptions of refactorings, with motivation, mechanics, and an example for each. A must-read.</description>

      <title>Store ssh keys inside the TPM: ssh-tpm-agent</title>
      <link>https://linderud.dev/blog/store-ssh-keys-inside-the-tpm-ssh-tpm-agent/</link>
      <description>After writing age-plugin-tpm a friend of mine at the hackerspace was super excited to finally have easy file encryption with TPM sealed keys, all without having to rely on gnupg. “This is great!” he said.
“I wish I could have my SSH keys sealed in a TPM just as easily”.
We should have left it at that.
I shouldn’t have replied with a random assortment of facts like “I know google/go-tpm now”, or “but Go has a ssh-agent protocol implementation” followed-up with “Filippo has already implemented yubikey-agent, it can’t be that hard”.</description>

      <title>Tales from the .NET Migration Trenches - Our First Views</title>
      <link>https://www.jimmybogard.com/tales-from-the-net-migration-trenches-our-first-views/</link>
      <description>Posts in this series:

 * Intro
 * Cataloging
 * Empty Proxy
 * Shared Library
 * Our First Controller
 * Migrating Initial Business Logic
 * Our First Views

Back when we looked at our first controller, we tried out the &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot; migration and the controllers migrated just fine but our views did not:

&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;viewport&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;@ViewBag.Title - My ASP.&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Today I found out that google docs infects html exports with spyware, no scripts, but links in your document are replaced with invisible google tracking redirects. I was using their software because a friend wanted me to work with him on a google doc, he is a pretty big fan of their software, but we were both somehow absolutely shocked that they would go that far.</description>

      <title>Pythagoras: Everyone knows his famous theorem, but not who discovered it 1000 years before him - Journal of Targeting, Measurement and Analysis for Marketing</title>
      <link>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16</link>
      <description>Everyone who has studied geometry can recall, well after the high school years, some aspect of the Pythagorean Theorem. However, the story of Pythagoras and his famous theorem is not well known. Some of the plot points of the story are presented in this article. The famous theorem goes by several names, some grounded in the behavior of the day, including the Pythagorean Theorem, Pythagoras’ Theorem and notably Euclid I 47. The Pythagorean Theorem is arguably the most famous statement in mathematics, and the fourth most beautiful equation. There are well over 371 Pythagorean Theorem proofs, originally collected and put into a book in 1927, which includes those by a 12-year-old Einstein (who uses the theorem two decades later for something about relatively), Leonardo da Vinci and President of the United States James A. Garfield. Pythagoras is immortally linked to the discovery and proof of a theorem that bears his name – even though there is no evidence of his discovering and/or proving the theorem. There is concrete evidence that the Pythagorean Theorem was discovered and proven by Babylonian mathematicians 1000 years before Pythagoras was born.</description>
