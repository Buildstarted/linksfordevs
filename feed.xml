      <title>French bar owners arrested for offering free WiFi but not keeping logs - CozyIT</title>
      <link>https://www.cozyit.com/french-bar-owners-arrested-for-offering-free-wifi-but-not-keeping-logs/</link>
      <description>At least five bar owners in Grenoble, France have been arrested for providing WiFi at their businesses without keeping logs. The bar owners were arrested under a 2006 law that technically classifies WiFi hotspot providing establishments as ISPs, and requires them to store one year’s worth of logs or connection records for anti-terrorism purposes. This […]</description>

      <title>Actively speaking two languages protects against cognitive impairment</title>
      <link>https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/news/actualitat/2020/360-bilingualism-alzheimer.html</link>
      <description>As well as allowing us to communicate with other people, languages are the tool we use to convey our thoughts, identity, knowledge, and the way we see and understand the world. Mastering more than one language enriches us, provides a gateway to other cultures and, according to a team of researchers led by scientists from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and Pompeu Fabra University (UPF), actively using them also brings us neurological benefits and protects us from cognitive impairment associated with ageing.</description>

      <title>Replacing Zoom with Open Broadcaster Software</title>

      <description>A post on local recordings
 Background Since the advent of the COVID-19 situation, there has been an increase in the demand for recorded materials. Standard approaches involve Zoom, which is not only proprietary, but also quite a bit of a privacy nightmare. The last straw was the random placement of my speaker bauble head.
  Figure 1: Zoom webcam placement
  At this point, given that I was to set up a pre-recorded video for PyCon India 2020, I decided to look into alternatives.</description>

      <link>https://mjpitz.com/blog/2020/09/30/slos-for-oss/</link>
      <description>Open source software has been used to build organizations for years.
From libraries to complex infrastructure systems, the open source landscape provides a vast sea of solutions.
For larger infrastructure projects, organizations are asking maintainers for service level objectives (SLOs).
Many do not publish or provide any, even when projects come from organizations who likely had SLOs in place.
In this post, I walk through my process for developing indicators and objectives for open source projects.</description>
