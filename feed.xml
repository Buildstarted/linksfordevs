      <title>how to read stuff posted online – Snakes and Ladders</title>
      <link>https://blog.ayjay.org/how-to-read-stuff-posted-online/</link>
      <description>Very few sites on the internet are meant to facilitate reading — most are, in fact, designed to inhibit reading. Imagine watching a movie and having the image regularly shrink to a tiny size, overwhelmed by a much larger advertisement which also plays its sound at double the volume of the movie’s sound — that’s what reading a corporate site is usually like. (I hope you will have noticed that I try to make this blog easily readable on large and small screens alike. Also, perhaps, that I have recently added a button to enable dark mode.)</description>

      <title>My First Month as a Solo Founder</title>
      <link>https://frankgroeneveld.nl/2021/04/28/first-month-as-solo-founder/</link>
      <description>On the first of april I started my first full-time month as the solo founder of Webindie. I’ll try to build a bootstrapped software-as-a-service product that should get me to ramen profitability in a year. Having previous experience running an agency was a huge help so far. Lots of entrepreneurial jobs such as doing taxes, requesting a business bank account, apply for a business credit card, and registering at the chamber of commerce were at least vaguely familiar to me. The development and hosting side of Webindie shouldn’t be a problem either, as at my previous position I’ve been developing and hosting Ruby on Rails web applications for 10+ years.</description>
