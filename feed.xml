      <title>Absurd Success</title>
      <link>https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/</link>
      <description>So… I’ve had the most unreal week of coding. Zero exaggeration, I’ve halved the RAM requirements of the search engine, removed the need to take the system offline during an upgrade, removed hard limits on how many documents can be indexed, and quadrupled soft limits on how many keywords can be in the corpus.
It’s been a long term goal to keep it possible to run and operate the system on low-powered hardware, and so far improvements have been made, to the point where my 32 Gb RAM developer machine feels spacey rather than cramped, but this set of changes takes it several notches further.</description>

      <description>Allow me to introduce you to one of the largest population groups in India,
as recognized by the constitution of India: Other Backward Classes 
(OBC Category). 
OBCs are estimated to comprise 40-45% of India&amp;#39;s population, therefore, about
500 million people belong to OBC category. 
In other words, 1 in 16 people in the world belongs to the OBC category. As you might have already guessed,
OBCs have historically been socio-economically disadvantaged. The wiki page is a good start.</description>

      <title>Transactions Across Data Stores</title>
      <link>https://petereliaskraft.net/blog/epoxy</link>
      <description>These days, it&amp;#39;s pretty common for a single application to use multiple data stores.
                            Sometimes, it&amp;#39;s because each data store is specialized for a particular task.
                            For example, an e-commerce site might use Postgres for robust customer data management, Elasticsearch for fast product search, and S3 for cheap image storage.
                            Other times, it&amp;#39;s because an app was built by multiple teams over time, so it ends up with one service storing customer data in Postgres and another storing customer data in MongoDB.</description>

      <title>Documentation Belongs in Engineering – Lennart Koopmann</title>
      <link>https://www.0x58ed.com/blog/documentation-belongs-in-engineering</link>
      <description>Many product companies start out with a very heavy focus on their engineering teams. At some point, many companies move the hosting and writing of documentation out of engineering and into a separate part of the company. It could be marketing, it could be customer success. This is a mistake.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Virtualization Metallize Libkrun Vsock</title>
      <link>https://taras.glek.net/post/lightweight-virtualization-metallize-libkrun-vsock/</link>
      <description>libkrun + krunvm
Github randomly recommended me libkrun
 which is a library backing krunvm
. It’s something similar to firecracker, but even simpler.
The most interesting feature there is:

“virtio-vsock (specialized for TSI, Transparent Socket Impersonation)”

AF_VSOCK
Linux/KVM AF_VSOCK is a way to avoid bridging and ethernet emulation for both performance and reduced attack surface. As far as I can tell only code mere mortals can use in a general way is to route over it is to use socat vsock support
.
Seems that libkrun implements a slirp-style network forwarded on kvm host side and I have no clue what they do inside kvm. If you figure that out, ping me on my socials.
Update: More info in twitter discussion
.
Embedding JITTED WASM in libkrun
HN completely ignored the story
 on how to marry above with WASM.
Why?

But there’s an scenario where Virtualization is not optional, and that’s when you want to protect the workload with Confidential Computing technologies such as SEV or TDX, as both of them are built on top of the existing Virtualization capabilities provided by the hardware.

Metallize
I once wrote a tool to make it easy to generate machine images using docker. I posted a re-implementation of that here: https://github.com/tarasglek/metallize

I need to make a really high performance networking setup to drive multiple 100G nics at max perf which required network namespaces, carefully setup subnets, cpu pinning, a custom fio, etc. Docker was the quickest way to iterate on those.
Apparently there is a way to do something similar using podman/buildah.
Conclusion
This set of technologies clicked together in my head from that random github recommendation. Writing these in a blog post in unlikely case this ever comes in handy.</description>

      <description>Prossimo is pleased to announce the first stable release of sudo-rs, our Rust rewrite of the critical sudo utility.
The sudo utility is one of the most common ways for engineers to cross the privacy boundary between user and administrative accounts in the ubiquitous Linux operating system. As such, its security is of the utmost importance.
The sudo-rs project improves on the security of the original sudo by:
  Using a memory safe language (Rust), as it&amp;#39;s estimated that one out of three security bugs in the original sudo have been memory management issues</description>
