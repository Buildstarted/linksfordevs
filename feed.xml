      <title>Accessing a DRM Framebuffer to display an image</title>
      <link>https://embear.ch/blog/drm-framebuffer</link>
      <description>To test if a display interface works we often don&amp;#39;t want to use a huge framework like GTK or Qt. This article shows an easy way on how we can use a framebuffer directly on a DRM graphics driver under Linux.</description>

      <title>Concurrency diagrams</title>
      <link>https://philbooth.me/blog/concurrency-diagrams</link>
      <description>When engineers discuss program design and system architecture,
a common source of misunderstanding is concurrency.
Often that&amp;#39;s because we make internal assumptions about it,
which we presume to be self-evident.
But we don&amp;#39;t all make the same assumptions,
so you can end up in a situation
where multiple conflicting beliefs are held
about the concurrency of a system
and nobody realises.
Left unchecked,
these misunderstandings can lurk
until much later in the development process,
when they&amp;#39;re more expensive to fix.
You can prevent these misunderstandings from happening
by making concurrency explicit up-front,
in a diagram.</description>

      <title>Which Projects Should Junior Devs Build? - Principal Software Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=5RZmwRJLRd4</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;m a junior developer -- Should I focus on TODO apps or try to build a business?

... Yeah, that about sums up the two major categories that I have coming in when this question is asked.

Many people have different opinions about this -- So of course, I have my own.

There are two major categories of things to build that I suggest, and each of them has different goals.

As with all livestreams, I&amp;#39;m looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.
