      <title>Go 1.21 Release Notes - The Go Programming Language</title>
      <link>https://go.dev/doc/go1.21</link>
      <description>The latest Go release, version 1.21, arrives six months after Go 1.20.
  Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
  As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of compatibility;
  in fact, Go 1.21 improves upon that promise.
  We expect almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.</description>

      <title>Getting my library cards onto my phone the hard way — iliana.fyi</title>
      <link>https://iliana.fyi/blog/ios-wallet-library-card/</link>
      <description>Our local libraries, The Seattle Public Library and the King County Library System, issue pieces of plastic with barcodes printed on the back assigned to your borrower account. These cards are not strictly necessary in 2023; most everything at Seattle libraries is self-service, including circulation, and these self-service entrypoints usually have a way to type in a library barcode manually. But having the barcode is far more convenient, and I’d like to have it without having to keep yet another plastic card I rarely use in my wallet.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic half levitation of LK-99-like synthetic samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03110</link>
      <description>We successfully synthesized polycrystalline LK-99-like ceramic samples with a
solid-state-sintering method. Powder X-ray diffraction shows that the main
contents are $\mathrm{Pb_{10-x}Cu_x(PO_4)_6O}$ and $\mathrm{Cu_2S}$, consistent
with recent reports [arXiv:2307.12037; arXiv:2308.01192]. In some small flaky
fragments, we successfully observed ``half levitation&amp;#39;&amp;#39; atop a
$\mathrm{Nd_2Fe_{14}B}$ magnet. Using magnetization measurements on such small
pieces, as well as on a large piece which does not exhibit the half levitation,
we show that the samples ubiquitously contain weak yet definitive soft
ferromagnetic components. We argue that, together with the pronounced shape
anisotropy of the small fragments, the soft ferromagnetism is sufficient to
explain the observed half levitation in strong vertical magnetic fields. Our
measurements do not indicate the presence of the Meissner effect, nor zero
resistance, in our samples, leading us to believe that our samples do not
exhibit superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Tradeoffs in Testing</title>
      <link>https://dillonshook.com/tradeoffs-in-testing/</link>
      <description>I’m finally getting around to putting down in words the testing philosophy I’ve developed over the years. Some of it might rock the boat a bit, other parts may be obvious to some folks, but what I’d like you most to take away is a reflection on your own testing philosophy and the tradeoffs your making. There’s no free lunch.
Choosing how much time to invest in testing is all about balancing how confidently you can say your program is doing what you intend to and how fast you can modify or add to your program.</description>

      <title>The Central Binomial Coefficient and Laplace&amp;#39;s Method</title>
      <link>https://cgad.ski/blog/the-central-binomial-coefficient-and-laplaces-method.html</link>
      <description>The central binomial coefficient is the sequence down the &amp;quot;center&amp;quot; of Pascal&amp;#39;s triangle, namely

These numbers show up, for example, in a random walk on the integers: if we start off at  and make  independent increments of  or , giving each choice even odds, then we will find ourselves back at the origin with probability

Some basic Markov process reasoning tells us that a random walk like this one can either be recurrent or dissipative: trajectories will either visit each position infinitely many times, or escape to infinity, spending only a finite number of steps at each position. Now, let  be our trajectory, and  be the number of times that . Since

the question of whether the random walk we have described is recurrent comes down to whether the central binomial coefficient grows quickly enough to make this series diverge. Does it? We can also consider the random walk on , moving at each step by an increment in the set , in which case the expected number of visits to the origin is

When are these processes recurrent? To answer either question, we need to figure out something about the asymptotic growth of central binomial coefficient.</description>

      <title>Writing a recursive descent parser in Bash &amp;#183; m10k</title>
      <link>https://m10k.eu/2023/07/29/pkgex-parser.html</link>
      <description>Two years ago, I was tasked to write a program that generates RPM package
repositories from a large pool of packages. The pool is a set of directories that
contain all packages that were ever built for a given Miracle Linux release, and
the program would be used to pick specific packages from the pool and generate
repositories for yum and dnf. The existing program had hard-coded rules for
package selection that made it require frequent repairs, and it didn’t play nice
with modularity packages. Since the new solution should be an improvement over
the old one, I decided to separate the rules from the code, and for this I needed
a small domain-specific language. I had already written a lot of absurd things in
Bash at the time, so naturally I had to see if a parser could be another of those
things.</description>

      <title>Notes on exit interviews</title>
      <link>https://rednafi.com/zephyr/notes_on_exit_interviews/</link>
      <description>If you’re a manager, then there’s no shortage of information for you on how to conduct exit interviews. But there aren’t many resources that focus on how to handle them from an employee’s perspective. I’ve been meaning to write a quick piece that isn’t biased by anyone else’s experience and is short enough so that I can quickly jog my memory in the future should the need arise. While I’ve participated in a few of them over the past five years, this text doesn’t attempt to combat the inexorable recency bias that may have seeped into the writing.</description>
