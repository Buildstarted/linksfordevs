It allows relatively cheap, scalable, local static analysis to find many common cases of heap-use-after-free and stack-use-after-return bugs. It allows other static analysis algorithms to be less conservative in their mod...</description>

      <description>Amazon’s Principal Engineer Community sets the standard for engineering excellence at Amazon.&amp;#160; The community comprises Principal, Senior Principal, and Distinguished Engineers who are responsible for driving Amazon’s overall technical architecture. Principal Engineers at Amazon are pragmatic visionaries. They make a lasting impact that echoes through the technology, the product, and the company. They work on Amazon’s hardest problems, building high quality, architecturally sound systems that are aligned with our business needs. They remain hands-on and lead by example. By being close to the details, they earn the respect needed to be effective technical leaders. Principal Engineers bring clarity to complexity and demonstrate smart ways to simplify. They are leaders and mentors, setting excellent examples for their local teams and the entire Amazon engineering community. They meet regularly&amp;#160;to question each other’s assumptions, illuminate pitfalls, and foster shared understanding across all groups at Amazon. Amazon&amp;#39;s Principal Engineering Community created a set of tenets to articulate and perpetuate the guiding values and expectations of Principal Engineers at Amazon!&amp;#160;Click here to learn more about the tenets.&amp;#160;

Amazon continues to expand our Principal Engineer Community and we are actively looking for senior technical individual contributors across every business at Amazon!
