      <link>https://www.rambli.com/2022/02/the-empty-release/</link>
      <description>A release with no value is not a release. Every release should have value, every release should have something that we are proud to stand behind and look back and say – “we did that”. Every release should have something that makes us go – “wow, this is fantastic”. Even hotfixes. Even Service packs. An</description>

      <link>https://shanedowling.com/consuming-content-like-its-the-90s.html</link>
      <description>It’s the 2020s, we continue to become more connected that we’ve ever
been, and I hate it! I don’t have the self-control needed to handle
these always-on devices. It’s awful. They’re all so incredibly powerful
and give so much in terms of information. I, however will be on reddit
or hackernews pretending I’m productive reading about someone else’s
terrificly productive project. I’ve lived with my brain enough to know,
uncontrolled smartphones aren’t really for me. I’ve written elsewhere
how my smartphone is basically a dumb
one,
but I’ve tried to replace the various pieces of value my phone delivers
with more dedicated devices.</description>

      <title>APIs as ladders</title>
      <link>https://blog.sbensu.com/posts/2022-01-24-apis-as-ladders/</link>
      <description>Developers have opinions on what a good API1 is, but rarely have a shared vocabulary to describe what makes them good. This essay puts forward one set of considerations (out of many) that we started using at Stripe in 2019 to discuss API design2. You can find some of these concepts interspersed in this excellent blogpost by Michelle Bu.The hard part of an API is not to use it, but to learn it. After learning how the API works, typing out the commands is not hard. But when you first time you encounter an API, a million questions pop into your mind: What is this object for? Is there a parameter for that? Can the API do X? Learning requires effort, but the more the developer learns, the more problems they can solve. We can imagine the developers climbing a ladder where, for every step they take up the “learning ladder”3, the more problems they can solve.</description>

      <title>The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and Massachusetts Institute of Technology release technological research on a central bank digital currency</title>
      <link>https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/frbb-and-mit-open-cbdc-phase-one.aspx</link>
      <description>The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Digital Currency Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology today released the findings of their initial technological research into a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. The published research&amp;#160;describes a theoretical high-performance and resilient transaction processor for a CBDC that was developed using open-source research software, OpenCBDC. This collaborative effort, known as Project Hamilton, focuses on technological experimentation and does not aim to create a usable CBDC for the United States. The research is separate from the Federal Reserve&amp;#39;s Board&amp;#39;s evaluation of the pros and cons of a CBDC.</description>
