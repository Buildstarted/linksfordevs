      <title>Having Fun With a Scamming Crypto Job</title>
      <link>https://nguyenhuythanh.com/posts/having-fun-with-a-scamming-crypto-job/</link>
      <description>I’m going to cover what happened and the technical details of a crypto job scam that I’ve avoided. Let’s hope that it can be both entertaining and informative.
It’s my second time encoutering this kind of scam. In the first time, I just ignored it as the sign is too obvious: a non-fitting job (frontend heavy job for a backend guy) where the recruiter is “impressed with my technical skills” and think that I’m “an exellent fit”.</description>

      <title>Mastodon Exit Interview</title>
      <link>https://v.cx/2025/04/mastodon-exit-interview</link>
      <description>I am currently winding down the Mastodon bots I used to post sunrise and sunset times. The precipitating event is that the admin of the instance hosting the associated accounts demanded they be made nigh-undiscoverable, but the underlying cause is that it’s become increasing clear that Mastodon isn’t, and won’t ever be, a good platform for “asynchronous ephemeral notifications of any kind”. I’d also argue (more controversially) that it’s simply not good infrastructure for social networking of any kind. There are lots of interesting people using Mastodon, and I’m sure it will live on as a good-enough space for certain niche groups. But there is no question that it will never offer the fun of early Twitter, let alone the vibrancy of Twitter during its growth phase. I’ve long since dropped Mastodon from my home screen, and have switched to Bluesky for text-centric social media.</description>
