      <title>IT'S TIME TO BUILD - Andreessen Horowitz</title>
      <link>https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/</link>
      <description>Every Western institution was unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, despite many prior warnings. This monumental failure of institutional effectiveness will reverberate for the rest of the decade, but it's not too early to ask why, and what we need to do about it... Our nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. We built roads and trains, farms and factories, then the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands of other things that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that define our lives and provide for our well-being. There is only one way to create the future we want for our own children and grandchildren, and that's to build.</description>

      <title>Enjoy Local Development with Tye, Docker, and .NET</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/local-dev-with-tye-docker-and-dotnet</link>
      <description>As developers, we have an arsenal of technologies at our disposal. While using new technologies can make us more productive, setting them up can drain us of enthusiasm and stunt our creative momentum. Container technologies, especially Docker, have blunted a lot of the pain inflicted by continuous yak-shaving. As .NET developers, we’ve benefited greatly from the cross-platform efforts of the teams at Microsoft.</description>

      <title>A Taste of GPU Compute</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqkAaplKBc4</link>
      <description>Presented by: Raph Levien

The GPU in a modern computer (desktop or mobile) has about an order of magnitude more raw general purpose computing throughput than the CPU, but is barely used except for games, machine learning, and cryptocurrency mining, largely because it’s hard to program. Getting good performance entails massive parallelism (thousands of threads) and careful attention to an explicit memory hierarchy. While GPU compute programming may seem to many like a black art, techniques from functional programming, including immutable data structures and an emphasis on associative operations (monoids) adapt very well to this space. This talk will present techniques used in piet-metal, a new 2D graphics rendering engine optimized for the modern GPU compute, and hopefully will serve as an invitation for the curious to explore this strange but powerful computing environment.

Raph Levien is currently an independent researcher exploring 2D graphics, font technology, and GUI, doing most of his work in Rust. Previously he was at Google for 11 years, including on the Android UI toolkit team, mostly working on fonts and text, and before that was the maintainer of Ghostscript. He has a PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, on the topic of curve design tools.</description>
