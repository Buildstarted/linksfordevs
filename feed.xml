      <link>https://zouhairj.com/notes/intrusion-detection-systems-ids/</link>
      <description>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a vital component of any organization&amp;#39;s cybersecurity infrastructure. They serve as the first line of defense against cyber threats, constantly monitoring networks and systems for suspicious activity and alerting administrators when an intrusion is detected. In this article, we will discuss the different types of IDS, how they work, and</description>

      <title>Thoughts on how I plan to retain more of what I consume — Raja Hamid</title>
      <link>https://www.rajahamid.com/journal/2022/12/31/thoughts-on-how-i-plan-to-retain-more-of-what-i-consume</link>
      <description>Although I plan out a lot of my day, I still find moments of ‘idle time’ where I’m doing nothing but mundane tasks like going on a jog, washing dishes, or grocery shopping. My body is engaged in an activity, but for the most part my mind is free to wander. Everyone has moments like this throughout t</description>

      <title>Conversation Skills Essentials – Tynan.com</title>
      <link>https://tynan.com/letstalk/</link>
      <description>A teacher friend of mine told me that this year students were different. If she asked to see a hall pass from a freshman, they’d give her the finger. They swore at her and were generally rude. The behavior was so out of line that seniors would step in and tell them not to talk to her like that. I asked why she thought that was happening, and she said, “Covid”. The lack of socialization, especially at such a key time in life, had made this incoming class the first one that lacked basic manners and social skills.</description>

      <title>Apparent Complexity Can Be Deceptive</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2023/apparent_complexity/</link>
      <description>As I look back to a turbulent year 2022, one of the things that sticks
out scientifically for me is the advent of high-quality generative
models. Whether it is DALL&amp;#183;E 2, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, or many
others: I really felt like I was seeing a large leap forward in terms of
capabilities of machine learning systems! At the same time, the chasm
between our understanding of these systems and our ability to use them
seemed to widen even further. It turns out that even our most basic
assumptions of how these systems can be trained are incomplete at best.
For instance, under the supervision of Tom
Goldstein, researchers showed that novel
diffusion models are not—contrary to the previous consensus—overly
reliant on Gaussian noise, and in fact, other sources of noise are
equally valid.1</description>

      <title>Give your strings context with StringSyntaxAttribute</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/d2b2fc18-ca4c-4879-b87f-a1d36f435805</link>
      <description>Strings are one of the most universal data types. We use them for URLs or regular expressions or even to define some date. With .NET 7 we have a new way of giving those strings a bit of meaning. Meet StringSyntaxAttribute.
I also show you a way how to use them in .NET 6 and earlier.

      <description>For the past few years, we have seen a lot of discussions around the concept of the Software Supply Chain. These discussions started around the time of LeftPad and escalated with multiple incidents in the past few years. The problem of all the work in this domain is that it forgets a fundamental point.</description>
