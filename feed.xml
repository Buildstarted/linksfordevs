      <title>The weird BLE-Lock</title>
      <link>https://nv1t.github.io/blog/the-weired-ble-lock/</link>
      <description>tl;dr; My knowledge in Bluetooth LE Communication got quite rusty over time and i wanted to refresh it with an easy target the other day. I wanted to open up the lock with a simple bluetooth command but ended up having access to their entire backend database with a lot of unique users across their entire product lineup.
It didn’t go as planned.
The Lock and API As all BLE-Locks work, they require an App to talk to the Lock itself and an API on the company side.</description>

      <title>Functional programming self-affirmations</title>
      <link>https://norikitech.com/posts/functional-affirmations/</link>
      <description>Dmitrii Kovanikov writes posts about enterprise software development and functional programming, both entertaining and serious. I never used a functional programming language (such as Haskell or OCaml) at work, but several ideas from functional programming have become popular in mainstream general-purpose programming languages such as Swift (which I mostly write). Often even a partially functional approach produces simpler code that’s easy to understand and quick to write and maintain. I’m always looking for good ideas I can adopt to write better code, whatever their source.</description>
