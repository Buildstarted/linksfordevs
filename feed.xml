      <title>xz/liblzma: Bash-stage Obfuscation Explained</title>
      <link>https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&amp;id=782</link>
      <description>Yesterday Andres Freund emailed oss-security@ informing the community of the discovery of a backdoor in xz/liblzma, which affected OpenSSH server (huge respect for noticing and investigating this). Andres&amp;#39; email is an amazing summary of the whole drama, so I&amp;#39;ll skip that. While admittedly most juicy and interesting part is the obfuscated binary with the backdoor, the part that caught my attention – and what this blogpost is about – is the initial part in bash and the simple-but-clever obfuscation methods used there. Note that this isn&amp;#39;t a full description of what the bash stages do, but rather a write down of how each stage is obfuscated and extracted.</description>

      <description>Well — we just witnessed one of the most daring infosec capers of my career. Here’s what we know so far: some time ago, an unknown party evidently noticed that liblzma (aka xz) — a relatively obscure open-source compression library — was a dependency of</description>

      <title>The de-nerdification of programming</title>
      <link>https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/the-de-nerdification-of-programming/</link>
      <description>Programming with LLMs, and building systems with LLMs, has completed the long de-nerdification of the field.
The programmers at the dawn of computing were nerds. They had no abstractions. They dealt with raw hardware – switches, circuits, currents. Binary code. Punched cards. Assembly language was a respite.
The next step up were high-level languages like FORTRAN and C. Imagine having mnemonics like FOR and variable declarations, after futzing with assembly.</description>

      <title>Tell the LLM the business context</title>
      <link>https://jameshfisher.com/2024/03/30/tell-the-llm-the-business-context/</link>
      <description>Employees do better when they have more business context. The same is true of LLMs! To do its best work, the LLM needs to know why it’s being prompted, where its input came from, how its output will be used, and how its output will be judged. Many prompters try to tell the LLM how to achieve some task, but it’s often better to just give it the business context.</description>

      <title>Django: Write-up on optimizing the system check framework - Adam Johnson</title>
      <link>https://adamj.eu/tech/2024/03/23/django-optimizing-system-checks/</link>
      <description>Django’s system check framework provides fantastic protection for configuration mishaps. It’s like a targeted linter that runs when you start Django commands. It takes advantage of runtime setup to inspect the true state rather than infer it from the source.</description>

      <title>The Reasonable Effectiveness of Using Old Phones as Servers</title>
      <link>https://jarbus.net/blog/phone-server/</link>
      <description>I installed linux on a OnePlus6T. Setup took less than an hour, technical issues included.
Why $90 for 8GB RAM, 128GB storage, 2.8GHz 8-core CPU Linux on the OnePlus 6T is well documented Low power consumption Tiny footprint No additional cables Built-in battery backup WiFi, bluetooth, speaker, screen, etc Negligible environmental impact sans shipping I wanted to play with Linux on ARM I don’t need a dedicated cable to power or connect it.</description>

      <description>As I understand it, there are just certain things in my life that I can&amp;#39;t stop doing. I&amp;#39;ve been writing in some fashion since I was 12. Writing seems to be an experience that is growing richer and I appear to be improving. There are other things in my life though which follow the same pattern- despite having every reason in the world to stop... I just can&amp;#39;t stop doing.</description>

      <title>My Ideal Libre Computer+Phone</title>
      <link>https://mpeyton.com/posts/my_ideal_libre_computer_phone/</link>
      <description>I have a very clear idea of what my “ideal” computer would be. It would incorporate all of the best aspects of the different computers (including smartphones!) I already use today, into a single machine.
The What First, it would have the form factor of a typical smartphone. This would allow me to carry it everywhere, and use it both one-handed and two-handed. I might even have it be a “hotdog-style foldable” to allow for comfier reading.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m watching some folks reverse engineer the xz backdoor, sharing some *preliminary* analysis with permission.

The hooked RSA_public_decrypt verifies a signature on the server&amp;#39;s host key by a fixed Ed448 key, and then passes a payload to system().

It&amp;#39;s RCE, not auth bypass, and gated/unreplayable.
