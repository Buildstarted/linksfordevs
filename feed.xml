      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/667db4f5-d34a-4625-bc3d-aa47187c591a</link>
      <description>Source Generators are more and more an integral part of the .NET ecosystem. But how does that play together with everyone&amp;#39;s favorite: Regular Expressions?
In this blog post we will dive in how we can leverage source generators in combination with regular expression to have a debuggable, but also very performant way of executing regular expressions!

      <description>TL;DR I used ChatGPT, with varying levels of success, to generate SVG images. With enough patience and prompting, you can get it to draw basic shapes and simple scenes about as well as a five year old can. (Which, hey, let’s face is, is good enough a lot of the time.)

      <title>Using Unpoly with&amp;#160;Django — /var/</title>
      <link>https://www.spapas.net/2023/04/04/using-unpoly-with-django/</link>
      <description>Over the past few years, there has been a surge in the popularity of frontend frameworks, such as React and Vue. While there are certainly valid use cases for these frameworks, I believe that they are often unnecessary, as most web applications can be adequately served by traditional request/response web pages without any frontend framework. The high usage of these frameworks is largely driven by FOMO and lack of knowledge about alternatives. However, using such frameworks can add unnecessary complexity to your project, as you now have to develop two projects in parallel (the frontend and the backend) and maintain two separate&amp;#160;codebases.</description>

      <title>Lucas Kostka - Technical solutions vs processes</title>
      <link>https://lucaskostka.com/posts/technical-vs-processes-solutions</link>
      <description>Processes appear to me as the defining attributes of any corporate environment. It&amp;#39;s
                    basically in anyone&amp;#39;s mouth and always come up as a first-citizen solution, whatever
                    the issue at hand. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll put a new process in place for escalating customer&amp;#39;s
                    complaints&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;We have been designing a new process to handle testing&amp;quot;, ... And
                    processes are not evil per se, at least as long as they streamline the resolution of
                    the issue they aim to solve. Which, in my experience, is where it usually falls
                    short.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s really easy to tend towards complexity as engineers. I think on some level, we love
complexity. There are obviously bad types of complexity, but I think there are other types
of it that we seek out, because there&amp;#39;s something satisfying about wrapping your head
around it; and I think a lot of that kind of complexity ends up in our programming
languages.</description>
