      <title>Things That Didn&amp;#39;t Kill My App</title>
      <link>https://jake.nyc/words/things-that-didnt-kill-my-app/</link>
      <description>The day SongRender launched, there was a bug that prevented files from uploading. I found out when my first paying customer’s videos failed to render. Since the files had never left his computer, there was no way for me to fix it for him. I had to ask him to email the files to me so I could manually render his videos. (He was very gracious).
Another time, I messed up the Netlify configuration for serving the website, so visitors were greeted by a blank white trendy minimalist page. To make matters worse, I had also misconfigured the uptime checker. It took a full day for me to realize the site was down.</description>

      <description>I mentioned this in a few previous posts, but for for those who may have missed it or forgotten, here’s a quick refresher - we use Always On Availability Groups at Stack Overflow on all of our main production servers running the network of public Q&amp;amp;A sites, Jobs, and Stack Overflow for Teams. It’s a great way to implement disaster recovery for a SQL Server environment.
Always On Availability Groups can support up to nine availability replicas, and while we don’t use anywhere near that many replicas in each of our clusters, we do have 2 replicas per cluster (3 servers total), with the replicas being used as a readable secondary.</description>

LMDh cars will form the top tier of the World Endurance Championship and North American IMSA WeatherTech Sportscar Championship from 2023, so there&amp;#39;s a bit of a wait.</description>
