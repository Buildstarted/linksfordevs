      <title>Modular Monoliths with Layla Porter</title>
      <link>https://open.spotify.com/episode/52uCuoROysgv3EhHlpRqph</link>
      <description>Listen to this episode from .NET Rocks! on Spotify. Microservices or Monoliths? Carl and Richard talk to Layla Porter about choosing a middle ground between microservices and monoliths, with modular monoliths. Layla talks about the pushback from the community around microservices and the insistence that there is &amp;quot;one right way.&amp;quot; Monoliths have their advantages until they are a problem - but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that re-architecting everything is the right way to go. Chipping off parts of the monolith into satellite modules strikes a balance of flexibility and scalability - and opens the door to accessing the power of bus architectures when needed!</description>

      <title>Documentation as Code for Cloud - PlantUML - blog.dornea.nu</title>
      <link>https://blog.dornea.nu/2023/07/30/documentation-as-code-for-cloud-plantuml/</link>
      <description>Basics I’ve become a huge fan of PlantUML even before I came across the concept of “documentation as code” I also code for presentations. So the term presentation as code is also a thing.  and it instantly won me over with its capabilities. I have used it in many different roles (software engineer, security engineer, security architect) extensively to draw diagrams (components, sequences) and mind maps.
Though initially, the general syntax might seem a bit challenging to understand, I believe that with some dedication, the learning curve becomes quite manageable.</description>

      <description>Quotebacks is a combination of a chrome extension which can be used to collect quotes from websites, and a little library which renders those quotes in a particular style. I wanted to use it for this website, but I didn’t want to use the existing rendering code1, so I built a plugin for the popular JavaScript library marked.</description>

      <description>FFmpeg is a powerful tool for manipulating audiovisual files. Unfortunately, it also has a steep learning curve, especially for users unfamiliar with a command line interface. This app helps users through the command generation process so that more people can reap the benefits of FFmpeg.</description>

      <title>Emacs 29.1 Released</title>
      <link>https://emacsredux.com/blog/2023/07/30/emacs-29-1-released/</link>
      <description>Today is a great day for Emacs - Emacs 29.1 has just been released1! Every Emacs release is special, but I haven’t been so excited about a new version of Emacs in ages. Why so? Reason #1 - pure GTK front-end (a.k.a. pgtk). This also means that now Emacs supports natively Wayland. Which in tern means that it’s easier than ever to run Emacs in Windows’s WSL. This is huge! Reason #2 - built-in support for the massively popular Language Server Protocol via eglot. eglot has existed for a while, but it’s nice to see it bundled with Emacs going forward. This will certainly make Emacs better positioned to complete with “modern” editors like VS Code. Reason #3 - built-in support for TreeSitter. This means that a few years down the road we’ll have many Emacs major modes that are much faster, robust and feature-rich. It’s infinitely easier to built a major mode using a real parser instead of using regular expressions. Lots of built-in modes have already been updated to have a version using TreeSitter internally. Frankly, I can’t think of a bigger improvement in Emacs in the almost 20 years I’ve been an Emacs user. Exciting times ahead! You can read all about the new release here. I’ll likely write a few articles about some of the new features in the weeks and months to come. In Emacs We Trust! M-x Forever! P.S. Feel free to share in the comments what are you most excited about. You can read the official release announcement here.&amp;#160;↩</description>
