      <title>Advanced SQL and database books and resources</title>
      <link>https://www.neilwithdata.com/advanced-sql</link>
      <description>For people who've worked through Mastery with SQL, a common question I get is "What's next?" If you completed the course and all 150+ exercises, at this point you'll have a very strong grasp of SQL and should be comfortable writing all sorts of complex queries. However, there's more to working with databases effectively - you might start to become interested in topics like database design, performance, transactions, locking, logging, security, configuration, and much more. Or you might want to dive deeper on the specific capabilities of the database you're using (e.g. Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).</description>

      <title>My Mid-Career Job-Hunt: A Data Point for Job-Seeking Devs</title>
      <link>https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/data-point-for-job-seeking-devs/</link>
      <description>I wrapped up my job search recently, and I’m happy to say that I’ll be joining a YC-backed startup called “Heap.” I thought I’d share a little bit about my job search in case the information may benefit other job-seeking devs. I’ll go over the pipeline of places I applied to and the result of each application. I’ll also talk about things like salary, resume formatting, coding challenge prep, and interviewing. I don’t intend any of this to be advice. Rather, I hope it’ll be a data point that other job-seeking devs could use to inform their own expectations about their search.</description>

      <title>Pinned Object Heap in .NET 5 – TooSlowException</title>
      <link>https://tooslowexception.com/pinned-object-heap-in-net-5/</link>
      <description>In the upcoming .NET 5 a very interesting change is added to the GC – a dedicated Pinned Object Heap, a very new type of the managed heap segment (as we have Small and Large Object Heaps so far). Pinning has its own costs, because it introduces fragmentation (and in general complicates object compaction a lot). We are used to have some good practices about it, like “pin only for…:</description>

      <description>One of the nice new features that we shipped in OmniSharp recently, and that has already made its way into the C# Extension for VS Code is support for decompilation.

      <description>Introduction
In March 2020, ML.NET added support for training Image Classification models in Azure. Although the image classification scenario was released in late 2019, users were limited by the resources on their local compute environments. Training in Azure enables users to scale image classification scenarios by using GPU optimized Linux virtual machines.</description>
