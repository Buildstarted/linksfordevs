      <title>A replacement for BinaryFormatter in .NET 8</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/4271d529-5625-4b67-bd59-d121f2d8c8f6</link>
      <description>In the old .NET Framework days, you could use the BinaryFormatter class to serialize and deserialize objects. This can be convenient for cloning or storing some session states. As the BinaryFormatter has some serious security concerns, the .NET team marked it as obsolete (as error) in .NET 7 and onwards.

      <title>What&amp;#39;s that touchscreen in my room?</title>
      <link>https://laplab.me/posts/whats-that-touchscreen-in-my-room/</link>
      <description>Discussion on HackerNews and Lobsters.
Roughly a year ago I moved into my new apartment. One of the reasons I picked this apartment was age of the building. The construction was finished in 2015, which ensured pretty good thermal isolation for winters as well as small nice things like Ethernet ports in each room. However, there was one part of my apartment that was too new and too smart for me.</description>

      <title>In search of Hidden Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://vivelev.xyz/hidden-laws</link>
      <description>Numerical experiments are just what their name implies: experiments. In describing and evaluating them, one should enter the state of mind of the experimental physicist, rather then that of the mathematician. Numerical experiments cannot be used to prove theorems; but, from the physicist&amp;#39;s point of view, they do often provide convincing evidence for the existence of a phenomenon. We will therefore follow an informal, descriptive and non-rigorous approach. Briefly stated, our aim will be to understand the fundamental properties of dynamical systems rather then to prove them.</description>

      <title>Sunrise-like Alarm Clock via Home Assistant + Android – nuxx.net</title>
      <link>https://nuxx.net/blog/2024/01/19/sunrise-like-alarm-clock-via-home-assistant-android/</link>
      <description>Quite a few years ago I came across Lighten Up!, which was a dawn-simulating alarm clock module that got connected between an incandescent lamp and used gently increasing light instead of noise. Coupled with a halogen bulb (that’d start out very yellow at lowest brightness) I had a wonderful sunrise-like alarm clock and it was much, much nicer than a beeping alarm.</description>

      <title>Mourning Google</title>
      <link>https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/01/15/Google-2024</link>
      <description>On March 15, 2010, I
    started a new job at Google. The fourteen years since that day feel like
    a century.
    The title of my announcement
    was Now A No-Evil Zone and, OK, I can hear the laughing from ten timezones away. I tried, then, to be restrained,
    but there are hardly words to describe how happy and excited I was. I had escaped from the accretion disk the former Sun
    Microsystems was forming around Oracle, that blackest of holes. And Google, in 2010, was the coolest place in the world to
    work.</description>
