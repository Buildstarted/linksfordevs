      <description>The winning playbook for how crypto projects gain mainstream adoption has not yet been written.  So how should new crypto founders start getting traction?  How does that traction inform other functions like product?  And what unique considerations does crypto introduce to traditional go-to-market?  This post will attempt to answer some of those questions.

      <title>Preparing to Issue 200 Million Certificates in 24 Hours</title>
      <link>https://letsencrypt.org/2021/02/10/200m-certs-24hrs.html</link>
      <description>On a normal day Let’s Encrypt issues nearly two million certificates. When we think about what essential infrastructure for the Internet needs to be prepared for though, we’re not thinking about normal days. We want to be prepared to respond as best we can to the most difficult situations that might arise. In some of the worst scenarios, we might want to re-issue all of our certificates in a 24 hour period in order to avoid widespread disruptions.</description>
