      <title>Beautiful and compact Web APIs with C# 9, .NET 5.0 and ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://www.strathweb.com/2020/10/beautiful-and-compact-web-apis-with-c-9-net-5-0-and-asp-net-core/</link>
      <description>Almost fours year ago I blogged about building lightweight microservices with ASP.NET Core 1.2 (which actually never shipped in such version and later became ASP.NET Core 2.0). The idea there was to drop the notion of bloated MVC controllers, get rid of as much as we can of the usual verbosity of C# based applications, and use a set of simple extension methods and a few cutting edge features of ASP.NET Core to provide a node.js style experience for authoring Web APIs.</description>

      <title>Viewing Matrices &amp;amp; Probability as Graphs</title>
      <link>https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-probability-graphs</link>
      <description>Today I&amp;#39;d like to share an idea.&amp;#160;It&amp;#39;s a very simple idea. It&amp;#39;s not fancy and it&amp;#39;s certainly not new. In fact, I&amp;#39;m sure many of you have thought about it already. But if you haven&amp;#39;t—and even if you&amp;#160;have!—I hope you&amp;#39;ll take a few minutes to enjoy it with me. Here&amp;#39;s the idea: Every matrix corresponds to a graph. So simple! But we can get a lot of mileage out of it.To start, I&amp;#39;ll be a little more precise: every matrix corresponds to a&amp;#160;weighted bipartite graph. By &amp;quot;graph&amp;quot; I mean a collection of vertices (dots) and edges; by &amp;quot;bipartite&amp;quot; I mean that the dots come in two different types/colors;&amp;#160;by &amp;quot;weighted&amp;quot; I mean each edge is labeled with a number.</description>

      <description>Some time ago, I wrote a short article called &amp;quot;Writing
HTML in HTML&amp;quot;,
where I explained why I use plain HTML to write, edit and maintain my
web site. As I&amp;#39;ve been living with my decision to eschew both dynamic
content management systems and static site generators for more than a
year, I&amp;#39;ve had the chance to reflect upon it, and I think it is time
for me to
update and clarify my original vision.</description>

      <title>How A Search Engine With 400 Million Records Literally Started From A Controller Class Test Method</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R19yQf1RVZM</link>
      <description>Six years ago I started work on a public records project idea.

After several days coding, I wondered for some reason how far back the undo history was on the IDE. 

Surprisingly, it went all the way back to the beginning of the file.

I decided to replay the undo history and take a video of it, thinking it was pretty cool.

Today, judyrecords is the largest search engine of United States court cases on the Internet, and one of the largest public records search engines in the world, with over 400 million court cases.

      <description>This is a follow up on a previous post
about how to host multiple isolated ASP.NET core applications in a single
process with with a single http listener/entry. The techniques used in that post
used types and classes e.g.
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Internal.StartupLoader that have been made
internal in ASP.NET Core 3.x and thus the approach is no longer viable.</description>

      <description>You can now use templates in Visual Studio that were installed through the dotnet cli. This opens even more opportunities for 3rd party template authors to integrate with tooling. This is currently a preview feature that must be enabled.

      <title>The physiological effects of slow breathing in the healthy human</title>
      <link>https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298</link>
      <description>Slow breathing practices have been adopted in the modern world across the globe due to their claimed health benefits. This has piqued the interest of researchers and clinicians who have initiated investigations into the physiological (and psychological) effects of slow breathing techniques and attempted to uncover the underlying mechanisms. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of normal respiratory physiology and the documented physiological effects of slow breathing techniques according to research in healthy humans. The review focuses on the physiological implications to the respiratory, cardiovascular, cardiorespiratory and autonomic nervous systems, with particular focus on diaphragm activity, ventilation efficiency, haemodynamics, heart rate variability, cardiorespiratory coupling, respiratory sinus arrhythmia and sympathovagal balance. The review ends with a brief discussion of the potential clinical implications of slow breathing techniques. This is a topic that warrants further research, understanding and discussion.

Key points 

Educational aims 

Slow breathing techniques have been used in asthma but are there effects in healthy individuals? &amp;lt;http://ow.ly/gCPO30eQOPZ&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>QUIC and HTTP/3 are open standards that have been under development in the IETF for almost exactly 4 years. On October 21, 2020, following two rounds of Working Group Last Call, draft 32 of the family of documents that describe QUIC and HTTP/3 were put into IETF Last Call.</description>

      <title>Taking a shortcut: You can query properties from a volume, and it will forward to the physical drive | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201022-00/?p=104391</link>
      <description>If you have the handle to a volume, you can issue certain disk ioctls to the volume, and it will forward them to the underlying disk. We saw this earlier when we used IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER to obtain the physical drive number from a volume.</description>

      <title>Learn C# with CSharpFritz - Ep 8: Abstract Classes, Interfaces and Error Handling</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj3GJTUaIaQ</link>
      <description>Let&amp;#39;s take a step into object oriented design and listen to Fritz explain abstract classes and interfaces.  We&amp;#39;ll use our newfound knowledge to write error handling and exceptions in our code.

Interactive Notebook with samples you can run IN BROWSER at:  https://aka.ms/csharpfritz_notebooks_2020

After the C# basics sessions are completed, which user interface framework do you want Fritz to walk through FIRST?  Vote for your favorite with an emote at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/issues/13

Questions:
00:12:10 - How do you make a new instance of a new generic object?
00:20:34 - Do abstract classes require at least one abstract method?
00:51:58 - Do you have a real world example of implementing interface default implementations?
01:19:37 - When should you throw an exception and when do you return an unsuccessful status?
01:22:01 - Basically Minecraft server uses this type of try / catch block for handling connection errors?
