      <title>A Home Network Troubleshooting Journey – nuxx.net</title>
      <link>https://nuxx.net/blog/2021/01/16/a-home-network-troubleshooting-journey/</link>
      <description>This week I moved from UniFi to a new setup that included OPNsense on the edge to handle firewall, NAT, and other such tasks on the home network. Built in to OPNsense is a basic NetFlow traffic analyzer called Insight. Looking at this and turning on Reverse lookup something strange popped out: ~22% of the traffic coming in from the internet over the last two hours was from just two hosts: dynamic-75-76-44-147.knology.net and dynamic-75-76-44-149.knology.net.</description>
