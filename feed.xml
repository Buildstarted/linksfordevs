      <title>Why Leetcode Style Interview Tests Are Bullshit</title>
      <link>https://www.darrenhorrocks.co.uk/why-leetcode-style-interview-tests-are-bullshit/</link>
      <description>Everybody has heard of the leetcode style interview tests, and given their prominence in the tech news recently, you won’t be surprised to find out that this is another story highlighting their inherent flaws.
Recently, after a remote interview on teams, I was given a set of 3 different leetcode style interview test questions. I was told to take “no more than 3 hours total” and to “write it using typescrypt”.
39 minutes later, I had completed and submitted all 3 tests, and all 3 tests pass all test cases. So now you ask, what’s the problem?</description>

      <description>Consider this provocative framing: what if we viewed our collective future not through the lens of human populations and national borders, but through available compute capacity? In this view, the race to build massive datacenter infrastructure becomes humanity's defining competition. This perspecti</description>

      <title>Async Traits Can Be Directly Backed By Manual Future Impls</title>
      <link>https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/async-traits-can-be-directly-backed-by-manual-future-impls/</link>
      <description>There’s a fun little tidbit that most people don’t seem to be aware of when
writing async functions in traits (AFITs) and that is: they allow you to
directly return futures from methods. Sounds confusing? Let me illustrate what I
mean with a simple example. Assume we have an a trait AsyncIterator which has an async fn next method that is defined as follows:</description>

      <description>It's a pedagogical pet peeve of mine when technical concepts are simply listed in their fully developed state, with little in the way of motivation, derivation, or historical context. This, I think, is like publishing a cookbook filled with beautiful pictures of cakes, but no recipes.

      <title>Life and Insecurities</title>
      <link>https://www.jerry.wtf/posts/life-and-insecurities/</link>
      <description>
In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except that life comes with insecurities.
Insecurity is a near-universal human condition.
Ironically, people who appear most confident often turn out to be driven by the deepest insecurities. They may dominate conversations, make grand pronouncements, or display what looks like pride. In reality this betrays a defense mechanism against a sensitive area in themselves that they have yet to address.
This suggests that insecurity works differently than most people think. It’s not simply about lacking confidence or self-esteem. There’s a more specific mechanism at play that needs to be understood in order to move past the platitudes of “Just be yourself” or “Fake it until you make it”.</description>
