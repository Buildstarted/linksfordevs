      <title>C++ coroutines: Improving cold-start coroutines which complete synchronously | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210422-00/?p=105139</link>
      <description>Last time, we learned that the na&amp;#239;ve implementation of cold-start coroutines is susceptible to stack build-up. What we want is for await_suspend to return false if the coroutine completed synchronously. This is tricky because that reintroduces a race condition where the coroutine runs asynchronously and completes at the same time we try to transition from synchronous to asynchronous behavior in the awaiter.</description>

      <description>TL;DR I set out to build the smallest container image that I could that was still able to do something useful. By taking advantage of multistage builds, the scratch base image, and a tiny assembly based http server, I was able to get it down to 6.32kB!
