      <title>C is not a serious programming language – keeping simple</title>
      <link>https://www.yodaiken.com/2021/05/16/c-is-not-a-serious-programming-language/</link>
      <description>The C Standards process over the last few decades has addressed both optimization and pointer type safety largely through a concept called “undefined behavior”.&amp;#160; The idea is that instead of&amp;#160; positive rules for what compilers and programmers can do, the Standard will identify some program behavior as something compilers can interpret how they want — really without any guidance at all. These things are not errors that must cause the compiler to reject code or even, necessarily things the compiler must warn about, but are instances of behavior that are without rules. I think this whole process is due to a misreading of the standard., but more importantly, it’s sloppy, makes it hard for programmers to have an intuition about the language, and leads to paradoxical results or nasty surprises.&amp;#160; For example, writing a value to a&amp;#160; variable from a pointer that has been advanced past the end of the object it was supposed to point to has been sort-of-kind-of designated as “undefined behavior”. Here’s&amp;#160; an example: the output of a simple C program compiled and “optimized” by gcc 11</description>

      <title>Hacking third-party APIs on the JVM</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/hacking-third-party-api-jvm/</link>
      <description>The JVM ecosystem is mature and offers plenty of libraries, so you don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Basic - and not so basic - functionalities are just a dependency away. Sometimes, however, the dependency and your use-case are slightly misaligned. The correct way to fix this would be to create a Pull Request. But your deadline is tomorrow: you need to make it work now! It’s time to hack the provided API. In this post, we are going through some alternatives that allow you to make</description>

      <description>Trackmania United Forever is a racing game in which the goal is to complete any track as fast as possible. Players compete against each other for the fastest times on tracks, and in order to keep records centralized, the community developed a website called Trackmania Exchange. This website maintains a “Top 10” leaderboard for all official tracks released by Nadeo and for hundreds of thousands of user submitted tracks, and is the main leaderboard Trackmania players compete on.</description>

      <title>git/torvalds/linux.git - Linux kernel source tree</title>
      <link>https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f076ef44a44d02ed91543f820c14c2c7dff53716</link>
      <description>In A.D. 1582 Pope Gregory XIII found that the existing Julian calendar
insufficiently represented reality, and changed the rules about
calculating leap years to account for this. Similarly, in A.D. 2013
Rockchip hardware engineers found that the new Gregorian calendar still
contained flaws, and that the month of November should be counted up to
31 days instead. Unfortunately it takes a long time for calendar changes
to gain widespread adoption, and just like more than 300 years went by
before the last Protestant nation implemented Greg&amp;#39;s proposal, we will
have to wait a while until all religions and operating system kernels
acknowledge the inherent advantages of the Rockchip system. Until then
we need to translate dates read from (and written to) Rockchip hardware
back to the Gregorian format.

This patch works by defining Jan 1st, 2016 as the arbitrary anchor date
on which Rockchip and Gregorian calendars are in sync. From that we can
translate arbitrary later dates back and forth by counting the number
of November/December transitons since the anchor date to determine the
offset between the calendars. We choose this method (rather than trying
to regularly &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; the date stored in hardware) since it&amp;#39;s the only
way to ensure perfect time-keeping even if the system may be shut down
for an unknown number of years. The drawback is that other software
reading the same hardware (e.g. mainboard firmware) must use the same
translation convention (including the same anchor date) to be able to
read and write correct timestamps from/to the RTC.

      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/css-isolation-in-aspnet-core-mvc6/</link>
      <description>This article will discuss about CSS Isolation in ASP.NET Core 6.0. CSS isolation simplifies an app’s CSS footprint by preventing dependencies on global styles and helps to avoid styling conflicts among components and libraries. CSS Isolation is enabled by default for ASP.NET Core 6.0 Projects. I am using Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.0-preview.3.21201.13 runtime in this project.</description>
