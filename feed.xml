      <title>When we had both landlines and cellphones</title>
      <link>https://broderic.blog/post/when-we-had-both-landlines-and-cellphones/</link>
      <description>Something I was just thinking about recently was our history of phones and how we used to all have a “home” phone. You know, just a phone that sits at home all day. A landline. Just about every home in America had one. Then suddenly cellphones came along, they got cheaper and cheaper until everyone had a flip phone in their pocket. And then one day, we each decided that there was no point in paying for a landline when we all had cell phones.</description>

      <description>Skating around the rink will get you to a decent level of comfort in your basic skating skills, but being able to land jumps and spins will force a whole new level of robustness and fault-tolerance in those underlying skills. The same applies to knowledge in general.</description>

      <title>Illness Is a Form of Meditation | Adnan&amp;#39;s Random bytes</title>
      <link>https://blog.adnansiddiqi.me/illness-is-a-form-of-meditation/</link>
      <description>Last night, I started feeling unwell during a company meeting. As the meeting progressed, I felt cold and began shivering. By the time it ended, the shivering had intensified. Even with socks on, I couldn’t warm up. I went to bed around 2 a.m. but had to get up multiple times to use the bathroom.</description>

      <title>Please provide home-assignment feedback face to face</title>
      <link>https://geopet85.github.io/2025/01/07/take-home-assignment.html</link>
      <description>You finally received a Calendly invitation for a call with the recruiter. You got past the recruiter call and received a home assignment. You promised you would never do them again, but here we are. The opportunity looks promising, the company seems solid, or it’s just the first application that got past the initial round after tens or hundreds of attempts. So, you decided to take the home assignment for this one. The email sounds abstract but understanding: “You have a week to complete this. Don’t worry; it won’t need more than a few hours of your time. We understand that you have other obligations. We only want to see how you deal with the given problem.”</description>

      <title>C# and Rust Side by Side – Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/exploring-programming-paradigms-c-and-rust-side-by-side/</link>
      <description>When it comes to programming languages, each has its quirks, strengths, and unique ways of looking at the world. Think of them as different superheroes with distinct powers. C# is your reliable, well-rounded champion of object-oriented programming (OOP), while Rust is the fearless defender of memory safety and performance. So, how do these two stack up when it comes to their paradigms? Let’s find out!</description>
