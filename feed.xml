      <title>Dark Patterns at Scale: Findings from a Crawl of 11K Shopping Websites</title>
      <link>https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/dark-patterns/</link>
      <description>Dark patterns are user interface design choices that benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into making unintended and potentially harmful decisions. We conducted a large-scale study, analyzing ~53K product pages from ~11K shopping websites to characterize and quantify the prevalence of dark patterns.</description>

      <title>Website Fingerprinting on Early QUIC Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11871</link>
      <description>Cryptographic protocols have been widely used to protect the user&amp;#39;s privacy
and avoid exposing private information. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections),
as an alternative to traditional HTTP, demonstrates its unique transmission
characteristics: based on UDP for encrypted resource transmission, accelerating
web page rendering. However, existing encrypted transmission schemes based on
TCP are vulnerable to website fingerprinting (WFP) attacks, allowing
adversaries to infer the users&amp;#39; visited websites by eavesdropping on the
transmission channel. Whether QUIC protocol can effectively resisting to such
attacks is worth investigating. In this work, we demonstrated the extreme
vulnerability of QUIC under WFP attacks by comparing attack results under
well-designed conditions. We also study the transferability of features, which
enable the adversary to use proven effective features on a special protocol
attacking a new protocol. This study shows that QUIC is more vulnerable to WFP
attacks than HTTPS in the early traffic scenario but is similar in the normal
scenario. The maximum attack accuracy on QUIC is 56.8 % and 73 % higher than on
HTTPS utilizing Simple features and Transfer features. The insecurity
characteristic of QUIC explains the dramatic gap. We also find that features
are transferable between protocols, and the feature importance is partially
inherited on normal traffic due to the relatively fixed browser rendering
sequence and the similar request-response model of protocols. However, the
transferability is inefficient when on early traffic, as QUIC and HTTPS show
significantly different vulnerability when considering early traffic. We also
show that attack accuracy on QUIC could reach 95.4 % with only 40 packets and
just using simple features, whereas only 60.7 % when on HTTPS.</description>

      <title>Baking with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://sararobinson.dev/2020/04/30/baking-machine-learning.html</link>
      <description>Like many people, I’ve been entertaining myself at home by baking a ton. I’ve gotten pretty good at following recipes, but I decided I wanted to take things one step further and understand the science behind what differentiates a cake from a bread or a cookie. I also like machine learning so I thought: what if I could combine it with baking??!</description>

      <title>Achieving 11M IOPS &amp;amp; 66 GB/s IO on a Single ThreadRipper Workstation - Tanel Poder Consulting</title>
      <link>https://tanelpoder.com/posts/11m-iops-with-10-ssds-on-amd-threadripper-pro-workstation/</link>
      <description>TL;DR Modern disks are so fast that system performance bottleneck shifts to RAM access and CPU. With up to 64 cores, PCIe 4.0 and 8 memory channels, even a single-socket AMD ThreadRipper Pro workstation makes a hell of a powerful machine - if you do it right!
 Introduction In this post I&amp;amp;rsquo;ll explain how I configured my AMD ThreadRipper Pro workstation with 10 PCIe 4.0 SSDs to achieve 11M IOPS with 4kB random reads and 66 GiB/s throughput with larger IOs - and what bottlenecks &amp;amp;amp; issues I fixed to get there. - Linux, Oracle, SQL performance tuning and troubleshooting - consulting &amp;amp; training.</description>

      <title>The Psychology of Stock Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://halldorbjarni.github.io/the-psychology-of-stock-bubbles/</link>
      <description>The recent 800% rally in the stock of brick-and-mortar video game store GameStop over the span of a couple of days, in the middle of a pandemic, seems to defy all laws of financial theory. Surely new information didn’t come forward so that the value of the business could suddenly grow 22 billions in just over 5 days. However, it is hardly the first time such bubbles have happened in individual stock issues. For example, Qualcomm rose a whopping 2,619% in the middle of the dot-com bubble before cratering when the bubble popped in 2000. And keep in mind that bubbles have been occurring long before the advent of technology and globalization. Back in the 18th century the Mississippi Company, a French trading company, rose 3,000% before losing more than 50% of its value the next year1. But what causes these bubbles to happen in the first place?&amp;#160;                 The Mississippi Bubble, or How the French Eliminated All Their Government Debt (So Why Can’t Bernanke?), 2013&amp;#160;↩</description>
