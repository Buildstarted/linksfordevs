      <title>The Free Software Foundation is dying</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2023/04/11/2023-04-11-The-FSF-is-dying.html</link>
      <description>The Free Software Foundation is one of the longest-running missions in the
free software movement, effectively defining it. It provides a legal foundation
for the movement and organizes activism around software freedom. The GNU
project, closely related, has its own long story in our movement as the coding
arm of the Free Software Foundation, taking these principles and philosophy into
practice by developing free software; notably the GNU operating system that
famously rests atop GNU/Linux.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: This article is as an entertainment piece NOT expert advice. See full disclaimer at the bottom of this article.
I&amp;amp;rsquo;m an avid diver and Engineer and love tech. So in my spare time I&amp;amp;rsquo;ve been slowly cracking away at building my own dive computer. For those who aren&amp;amp;rsquo;t familiar, a dive computer keeps track of how long you&amp;amp;rsquo;ve been at a particular depth. It then does some fancy calculations to determine if the dissolved nitrogen in your blood is going to boil as your resurface.</description>

      <title>Cedric Charly&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.cedriccharly.com/post/20230409-cheap-thought/</link>
      <description>Software engineering, the realm of bits, has long been organized around the idea that developing software is an expensive endeavor. Not only are software engineers costly, but code itself carries a certain weight. Once code is written, it must be maintained and extended. Bugs and migrations are costly mistakes, prompting us to adopt practices such as continuous integration (CI), test-driven development (TDD), and code reviews. These practices aim to identify issues as early as possible and shift development leftward.</description>

      <title>C4 at scale: make it efficient, then make it ambient</title>
      <link>https://blog.owulveryck.info/2023/04/05/c4-at-scale-make-it-efficient-then-make-it-ambient.html</link>
      <description>Introduction C4 (Context, Containers, Components, and Code) is a powerful and flexible approach to visualizing software architectures.
In a previous article I explained how I created a DSL to describe my C4 as data thanks to the CUE language.
In this article, we’ll explore how I effectively use the C4 tool based on CUE to organize my code, handle tags, manage versioning, and integrate with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) systems to generate and update diagrams.</description>
