      <title>Complexity of Caching: Strategy, Invalidation &amp;amp; Fallbacks</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx8ONrUq4a4</link>
      <description>Caching ain&amp;#39;t easy! There are many factors that add to the complexity of caching.  My general recommendation is to avoid caching if you can.  However, caching can bring performance and scaling which you might need.

If you&amp;#39;re starting to use a cache in your system here are some things to think about. Adding a cache isn&amp;#39;t that trivial and requires some thought about caching strategies, how to invalidate, and fallbacks to your database. Caching can improve performance and scalability, but can also bring your entire system down if it&amp;#39;s failing.
