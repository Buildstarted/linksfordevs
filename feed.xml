      <link>https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2020/06/03/the-weaponization-of-diversity/</link>
      <description>This is an unusually lengthy essay, because the issue is so complex and nuanced that it deserves an appropriate level of patience and attention. It includes my deeply honest, personal, and some would say risky perspective on the topic of diversity in high-performance careers, including tech entrepreneurship; and my concern that the decision by some […]</description>

      <title>Code Review and Criticism · Caffeinspiration</title>

It’s as if it’s in a separate pond from my private one, where any ripples don’t cross the pebbly barrier to the rest of me. I’m still proud of the things I make and still take ownership over code, projects, and problems, but those things are separate from me.</description>
