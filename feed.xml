      <title>The indifference engine</title>
      <link>https://ponnekanti.net/posts/the-indifference-engine/</link>
      <description>It’s just insane that language models actually work. How is it possible. The world is enchanted. Do you still feel it? A kind of feverish awe? My computer can talk to me, it can teach me, yet it possesses no greater essence than its transistors…
Except I don’t really feel like that. Not often, certainly not constantly. I think the most beautiful thing about it all to me is how one is forced to constantly excite themselves into this state. It would be so easy to let it slip into normalcy. “OK. Guess my laptop can talk to me now and teach me anything”. Accept and move on. Kids using them to cheat on their essays. Out of nowhere, eldritch magic cast into our computers, and just like that effortlessly integrated into life. The machine is not human-shaped. The human is machine-shaped. We can accept anything, this is the rule that governs us.</description>

      <title>Coffee and Open Source Conversation - David Whitney</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=FK6DdD5ke9Y</link>
      <description>David is the Director of Architecture for NewDay, and the founder of Electric Head Software. Focusing on iterative software delivery, developer mentoring and cultural change - mostly working with London-based organisations.

He speaks about software design, culture, and ethics in technology - rounded out by an assortment of talks about software that probably doesn't need to exist but makes the world a little more fun. David has previously served as the chief coding technical architect for JustGiving and helped market-leading organisations including JUST-EAT, Trainline and Vodafone improve their technical capabilities.

David is a Microsoft MVP, has been part of the OpenUK Honours list for open-source advocacy, and is a twice bestselling author of children's books about programming.

There's a chance you've seen him talk at a spread of conferences, user groups and code-dojos around the UK over the last decade or indulged in bar-room programming debates after one.

      <title>Are LLMs random?</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2025/04/26/llm-coin-toss-odd-even</link>
      <description>While LLMs theoretically understand “randomness,” their training data distributions may create unexpected patterns. In this article we will test different LLMs from OpenAI and Anthropic to see if they provide unbiased results. For the first experiment we will make it toss a fair coin and for the next, we will make it guess a number between 0-10 and see if its equally distributed between even and odd. I know the sample sizes are small and probably not very statistically significant. This whole thing is just for fun.</description>

      <title>goodbye, big tech</title>
      <link>https://www.savageevan.com/goodbye-big-tech/</link>
      <description>Over the next couple of years, I'll be slowly moving away from Big Tech platforms and apps. In this post, I'll discuss why I'm doing this, and what it means in practice. This post is also an investigative exercise: what is my Big Tech footprint, and what are my alternatives?</description>

      <title>Qwen3: Think Deeper, Act Faster</title>
      <link>https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/</link>
      <description>QWEN CHAT GitHub Hugging Face ModelScope Kaggle DEMO DISCORD
Introduction Today, we are excited to announce the release of Qwen3, the latest addition to the Qwen family of large language models. Our flagship model, Qwen3-235B-A22B, achieves competitive results in benchmark evaluations of coding, math, general capabilities, etc., when compared to other top-tier models such as DeepSeek-R1, o1, o3-mini, Grok-3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro. Additionally, the small MoE model, Qwen3-30B-A3B, outcompetes QwQ-32B with 10 times of activated parameters, and even a tiny model like Qwen3-4B can rival the performance of Qwen2.</description>

      <title>What the heck is AEAD again?</title>
      <link>https://ochagavia.nl/blog/what-the-heck-is-aead-again/</link>
      <description>Here’s a problem you might be familiar with: I keep forgetting what AEAD exactly means and why you would ever use it. Yes, I know the acronym stands for “Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data”, but does that really clarify anything? Not to me, so I’ve finally decided to sit down and write this blog post as a piece of help for my future self… and for anyone else who finds AEAD hard to retain.</description>

      <title>Using ImmutableSortedSet in C# for memory sharing</title>
      <link>https://bazookamusic.me/blog/posts/immutable-sorted-set/</link>
      <description>Immutable data structures in C# have always seemed very intriguing to me because while they come with many interesting properties, I very rarely find a situation where they would be appropriate to use. Finding one of those situations is exciting enough to motivate me to write an article about it!</description>

      <title>Is outbound going to die?</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2025/04/25/sales-outbound-ai-dead</link>
      <description>I see a ton of sales/marketing products all powered by AI, making hyper personalised content to target potential users and customers. These tools now make sophisticated, high-volume paid marketing campaigns accessible to everyone, from large enterprises to individual consumers. With LLMs, the messages and content have gotten to a point where the accuracy and quality of the has improved tremendously at scale. Moreover, the scale of outbound sales has also increased rapidly. You are now able to pump out 1000s of SEO blog posts, generate reels/videos on the fly and even use AI agents to do email/phone outreach at a never before seen scale.</description>
