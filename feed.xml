      <title>We Didn't Encrypt Your Password, We Hashed It. Here's What That Means:</title>
      <link>https://www.troyhunt.com/we-didnt-encrypt-your-password-we-hashed-it-heres-what-that-means/</link>
      <description>You've possibly just found out you're in a data breach. The organisation involved may have contacted you and advised your password was exposed but fortunately, they encrypted it. But you should change it anyway. Huh? Isn't the whole point of encryption that it protects data when exposed to unintended parties?</description>

      <title>What is your take on checking return values?</title>
      <link>https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/09/02/check/</link>
      <description>One day not so long ago, I was in a meeting listening to a team explain  
why their service had gone down and taken out a big chunk of a business.  
They were one of those things that has to exist and work in order for 
the actual "thing that makes money" to go.  Think of delivering pizzas, 
connecting dog walkers with dogs who need to be walked, that kind of 
thing.</description>

      <title>A case for the mediocre developer</title>
      <link>https://khromov.se/a-case-for-the-mediocre-developer/</link>
      <description>Software engineers today face a lot of difficulties in their jobs. The available toolset increases on a seemingly monthly basis. New frameworks are in, old frameworks are legacy. What was previously a job that could be specialized in across a few well-understood components is now spread out amongst large swaths of libraries, abstraction and infrastructure. This is the power of open-source, but also its curse. The fact that complexity is increasing around us is a trite argument. Due to this ongoing shift, it’s easier than ever to start developing but harder than ever to become proficient in it. In light […]</description>

      <title>Use TempDataAttribute For Clean Code</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/use-tempdataattribute-for-clean-code</link>
      <description>In a previous post, I wrote about solving the form resubmission confirm issue that many developers run into when building web applications. In ASP.NET MVC, we have many tools at our disposal to pass information from one method to another, the most common being the TempDataProvider. In this short but enlightening post, we’ll take a look at how we can use a new feature in ASP.NET Core to clean up our usages of TempData.</description>

      <title>MIT 18.S097: Programming with Categories</title>
      <link>http://brendanfong.com/programmingcats.html</link>
      <description>In this course we explain how category theory—a branch of mathematics known for its ability to organize the key abstractions that structure much of the mathematical universe—has become useful for writing elegant and maintainable code. In particular, we'll use examples from the Haskell programming language to motivate category-theoretic constructs, and then explain these constructs from a more abstract and inclusive viewpoint. Hands-on programming exercises will be used to demonstrate categorical ideas like 'the universal property of products' in working Haskell code.</description>
