      <description>My friend sent me a tunnel link where he had to manually set it up with socat and his nginx ingress controller in his k8s cluster. He made an offhand comment about needing a better way to setup tunnels and it got me thinking. This post is the result of a long night of hacking away at my own tunnel solution.

      <title>Implementing an SHA transformer by hand</title>
      <link>https://andrew.gr/stories/sha/</link>
      <description>So the first question, you, and any reasonable person, may have when
seeing this post title is &amp;quot;why?? why would you ever do this?&amp;quot; Well, I
have a pretty good reason—Andis and I came up with a scheme to insert
undetectable backdoors into transformers, but it depends on
having a &amp;quot;submodule&amp;quot; which can compute a pretty strong hash. SHA-2 is a great
candidate for this—not least because its Wikipedia article actually has
pseudocode for its implementation—so now all we have to do is make a
transformer which, given some input, places that input&amp;#39;s hash into the
residual stream.</description>

      <link>https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/my-cat-alerted-me-to-a-ddos-attack</link>
      <description>A few years ago, my cat gave me my most memorable middle of the night software
engineering incident. I was working at a startup, and we didn’t have a formal
on-call rotation yet. That was a deliberate decision, since being on-call is
painful, and the team was good about just collectively keeping an eye out for
urgent alerts. We eventually set up an on-call rotation, but before that
happened, I had a fun night.</description>
