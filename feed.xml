      <description>I finally made the switch from X11/i3 to Wayland/Sway, and things are, for the most part, better on Wayland. I’ve managed to replicate almost everything from my setup, albeit with different tools, but there are exceptions and I thought I’d write about one that I have not managed to replicate on Sway.</description>

      <title>Revocation ain't no thang.</title>
      <link>https://dadrian.io/blog/posts/revocation-aint-no-thang</link>
      <description>Adam Langley wrote about how revocation in the Web PKI doesn’t work over 10 years ago. Since then, the Web PKI has drastically changed for the better, despite not appearing to “solve” revocation. Unfortunately, many people interpret Adam’s post to mean “we must build a better revocation system for the Web PKI, today”. In reality, revocation does not make sense to solve anymore, and people should stop trying to solve it directly, because the actual solution to revocation in the public Web PKI is short-lived certificates.</description>

      <title>Cleaning up my $HOME with XDG Base Directory Specification</title>
      <link>https://evgeniipendragon.com/posts/cleaning-up-my-home-with-xdg-base-directory-specification/</link>
      <description>In my career I worked with plenty of different software that require the presence of certain environment variables for them to function properly. From time to time I would notice that the program either offers it as an option or requires you to have XDG_... type variable be set in your environment. I never looked too deeply into it, however I understood that it provided base paths for the locations of configuration and application files. I simply never tried to understand what those variables are and why they begin with XDG. Recently, I have stumbed upon several software configurations where I have encountered XDG variables again. So, I decided to look it up and find out what all of that was about.</description>

      <title>How Opus and o3 saved me from permanent blindness</title>
      <link>https://mmaaz.ca/writings/blindness.html</link>
      <description>A few weeks ago, I suddenly started going blind in my left eye. Yes, really. If I closed my right eye, about 80% of my vision was dark grey or black. I couldn't see my own hand in front of my face! Thankfully, Opus and o3 (I'll just refer to them as AI; all queries were sent to one or both, and distinguishing between them is not important to the story) massively helped me, and, I believe, essentially saved me from it becoming a permanent issue. Eventually, I was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease called MOG-associated disease (MOGAD). I'm not sure what this looks like going forward. But, here, I'd like to tell my story. This is part medical case study, part personal story, and part AI capabilities demonstration.</description>

      <title>Adios Chicos, 25 Years of KDE – Jonathan Riddell's Diary</title>
      <link>https://jriddell.org/2025/09/14/adios-chicos-25-years-of-kde/</link>
      <description>It was the turn of the millenium when I got my first computer fresh at university.  Windows seemed uninteresting, it was impossible to work out how it worked or write programs for it.  SuSE Linux 6.2 was much more interesting to try and opened a world of understanding how computers worked and wanting to code on them.  These were the days of the .com boom and I went to big expos in London where they showered you with freebies and IBM competed with SuSE and Red Hat for the biggest stall.  IBM said that Linux had made it on the server and now was going to take over the desktop so I realised that working with KDE would be a good idea.  And as a novice coder it was very perfect for learning Qt and how open development worked and I loved the free software ideals.  Going to the pre-Akademy conference (it was called Kastle then) in Nove Hrady was a great intro to the community in person and in some ways I learnt more about software development in a week there then my years at uni.</description>

      <title>Light beam shader in godot</title>
      <link>https://passivestar.xyz/posts/light-beam-shader-in-godot/</link>
      <description>So I was noclipping through d1_canals_08 in HL2 as one normally does on a saturday night when I saw this:
A nice sharp volumetric light that does a lot for the mood of the scene.
Half Life 2 was released in 2004 so obviously it’s not “real” volumetric fog but just a picture of a light beam that rotates towards the camera using Z-Billboard technique. It’s only visible when you look at it from the side. When you look at the light straight on, it fades out to hide the fact that it’s a billboard.</description>
