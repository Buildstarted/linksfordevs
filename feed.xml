      <title>On architecture, urban planning and software construction</title>
      <link>http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/cities-and-programming/</link>
      <description> Like software construction, architecture and urban planning often deal with
complex systems that evolve over a long period of time. Some of the successful systems are
also quite messy despite theories telling us that such systems should not work. These are just
a few of the reasons why software engineers can learn interesting things from reading about
architecture and urban planning.</description>

      <link>https://platform.uno/blog/uno-platform-2-1-available-now-xbind-dualpaneview-and-more/</link>
      <description>Uno Platform 2.1 release is packed with over 50 new features allowing for increased productivity as well as getting you up and running with Surface Duo. In addition to bigger milestones such as x:Bind, the TwoPaneView and NumberBox controls we also shipped another 50 new features and closed 45 issues you raised. Without further ado: x:Bind functions Uno has been supporting some form of x:Bind markup for properties, binding to functions were a big ask from users of Uno, as it allows for invoking methods from code behind very easily. Two of the largest use of x:Bind functions is to reduce the use of converters, and the use of static properties. Another use of the x:Bind is familiar to WPF developers, where binding to multiple properties is also available. You‚Äôll find below some examples of the x:Bind feature. Member Function, to make a string upper case: &lt;TextBlock Text="{x:Bind MyProperty.ToUpper()}" /&gt; Static type fields or properties OneTime binding: &lt;TextBlock Text="{x:Bind local:StaticType.PropertyIntValue}" /&gt; OneWay local member function with multiple observable parameters: &lt;TextBlock Text="{x:Bind Multiply(slider1.Value, slider2.Value), Mode=OneWay}" /&gt; Literal boolean parameters: &lt;TextBlock Text="{x:Bind BoolFunc(x:False)}" /&gt; Literal numeric value: &lt;TextBlock Text="{x:Bind Add(InstanceProperty, 42.42)}" /&gt; Use of system functions such as: &lt;TextBlock Text="{x:Bind sys:String.Format('Formatted {0}', ‚Ä¶</description>

      <title>Gnoosic - Discover new Music</title>
      <link>http://www.gnoosic.com/</link>
      <description>Gnod is a self-adapting system that learns about the outer world by asking its visitors what they like and what they don't like. In this instance of Gnod all is about music. Gnod is kind of a search engine for music you don't know about. It will ask you what music you like and then think about what you might like too. When I set Gnod online its database was completely empty. Now it contains hundreds of thousands of bands and quite some knowledge about who likes what. And Gnod learns more every day. Enjoy!</description>
