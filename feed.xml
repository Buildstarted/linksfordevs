      <description>I recently got my hands on an old unserviceable aircraft transponder from my flying club. The tinkerer me was obviously very curious on what’s inside this piece of equipment. What better way to find out then to do a teardown!

      <title>Spotify is trying to embrace, extend, and extinguish open podcasting – Kyle Piira</title>
      <link>https://www.kylepiira.com/2020/06/22/spotify-is-trying-to-embrace-extend-and-extinguish-open-podcasting/</link>
      <description>I really love podcasts. Not only do they provide great entertainment value as an alternative to audiobooks, but they are also one of the last open ecosystems on the web. Anyone can start a podcast by publishing an RSS feed on their website without having to rely on a central platform (thus nobody can “ban” your podcast). Once published listeners can consume their favorite podcasts from any RSS reader, including many specially made for podcasts like PocketCasts and Overcast.</description>

      <description>From the beginning, Mixer has been about creating the most engaging and interactive livestreaming experience. We set out to help streamers build great communities based on deep engagement with their audience. You all have been amazing throughout this journey – the Mixer community has focused on creating welcoming and inclusive communities, and you should be proud of what you have accomplished together. Ultimately, the success of Partners and streamers on Mixer is dependent on our ability to scale the platform for them as quickly and broadly as possible. It became clear that the time needed to grow our own livestreaming community to scale was out of measure with the vision...</description>

      <title>Chat Wars</title>
      <link>https://nplusonemag.com/issue-19/essays/chat-wars/</link>
      <description>In the summer of 1998 I graduated from college and went to work as a programmer at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. I was put on the group that was building MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft’s instant messaging app. The terrible name came from Marketing, which had become something of a joke for always picking the clunkiest and least imaginative product names. Buddy List? C U C Me? MSN Messenger? No, MSN Messenger Service. I’ll call it Messenger for short.</description>

      <title>InnoDB Internals - Consistent Reads</title>
      <link>https://yizhang82.dev/innodb-internals-consistent-reads</link>
      <description>Overview I’ve been doing some research in this area trying to understand how this works in databases (for my upcoming project), so I thought I’d share some of my learnings here. InnoDB internally uses ReadView to establish snapshots for consistent reads - basically giving you the point-in-time view of the database at the time when the snapshot it is created. In InnoDB, all changes are immediately made on the latest version of Database regardless whether it has been committed or not, so if you don’t have MVCC, everybody will see the latest version of rows and it’ll be a disaster for consistency. Not to mention you’ll need to be able to rollback the changes. In order to achieve this, InnoDB maintains a undo log to track a link list of changes made by other transactions, so reading in the past with a snapshot means going from the latest record in the BufferPool, and walk backwards to find the first visible change. Rollback is similar. This also means the undo log can’t be purged if the snapshot is still active, and undo log will get longer and longer, which slows down the reads more and more. This is the infamous long running transaction issue. The fundamental issue is that you need to be able to determine visibility of changes. This is done with two things: InnoDB tracks the trx_id_t of each rows and in the undo log InnoDB internally use a data structure called ReadView to determine if a transaction is visible in the snapshot. So the algorithm becomes as simple as walking the list backwards and find the first visible record.</description>
