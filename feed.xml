      <title>Idempotency: Protect Yourself Against Multiple Event Processing Mistakes</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=ufHA8cC7kgc</link>
      <description>Hi, I'm James Eastham and in this video you'll learn about the crucial concept of idempotency in event-driven systems to prevent issues arising from receiving the same event multiple times.

You'll learn how to manage and verify idempotency using both unique identifiers and business logic. By using a payment processing scenario, I'll illustrates how to store processed event information in caches or databases to avoid duplicate handling

The video provides a detailed example of implementing idempotency with .NET and emphasizes the importance of being equipped to handle duplicate events to ensure system reliability.

00:00 Introduction and Payment Glitch Scenario
00:25 Understanding Event-Driven Architectures
01:21 The Importance of Idempotency
03:24 Implementing Idempotency with Unique Identifiers
06:00 Practical Example: Payment Service in .NET
11:20 Conclusion and Best Practices

      <title>Simplest backpropagation explainer without chain rule</title>
      <link>https://poonai.xyz/posts/simplest-backpropagation-explainer-without-chain-rule/</link>
      <description>Neural Networks learn to predict by backpropagation. This article aims to help you, build a solid intuition about the concept using a simple example. The ideas we learn here can be expanded for bigger nerual network. I assume that you already know how feed forward neural network works.
Before reading the article further, take a pen and paper. The calculation used in this article can be done in the head. But I still want you to do by hand.</description>

      <title>Server Components Give You Optionality | Daniel Saewitz</title>
      <link>https://saewitz.com/server-components-give-you-optionality</link>
      <description>It feels as though people see React Server Components as a prescription, in that they prescribe how you must use them. In reality, they are largely additive: you don't have to fetch your data on the server and you don't have to run a server at all. What React Server Components do is give you optionality to decide where you want your code to run: the server, the client, or both. And when: build-time or run-time. It gives you the ability to move between those environments seamlessly through composition. For experts who want freedom of choice, RSCs are a powerful solution. If you find them confusing, it's because nothing like them has existed before, but once you internalize their design, you'll see why their ideas will live on for a long time.</description>

      <title>No-engine gamedev using Odin + Raylib</title>
      <link>https://zylinski.se/posts/no-engine-gamedev-using-odin-and-raylib/</link>
      <description>Games can be made in many different ways. Many games are made using big, general purpose game engines such as Unity and Godot. I enjoy using the Odin Programming Language combined with Raylib.
Odin is a C-like programming language and Raylib is library for drawing graphics, checking input and playing sounds. So it’s just a program that uses a simple library, no engine!
There are no objectively best ways to create games.</description>

      <title>Don't animate height!</title>
      <link>https://www.granola.ai/blog/dont-animate-height</link>
      <description>Our app was mysteriously using 60% CPU and 25% GPU on my M2 MacBook.
It turned out this was due to a tiny CSS animation!
In this post,
I show how to find expensive animations,
why some are so expensive,
and how to make many animations much cheaper.
Along the way,
we'll learn how the browser renders CSS animations
and how to use Chrome's dev tools for performance profiling.</description>

      <title>The best – but not good – way to limit string length</title>
      <link>https://adam-p.ca/blog/2025/04/string-length/</link>
      <description>Getting the length of a string seems simple and is something we do in our code every day. Limiting the length of a string is also extremely common in both frontend and backend code. But both of those actions – especially length limiting – hide a lot of complexity, bug-risk, and even vulnerability danger. In this post, we’re going to examine string length limiting deeply enough to help us fully grok what it means when we do it and how best to do it… and discover that the best still isn’t great.</description>

      <title>You Can’t Prompt Your Way to Intuition - Annie Vella</title>
      <link>https://annievella.com/posts/you-cant-prompt-your-way-to-intuition/</link>
      <description>We don’t talk enough about the feeling of learning something deeply - the slow, sometimes frustrating and painful process that forges real intuition.
As software engineers, we know this feeling intimately. The slow burn of mastering a new concept or language. The pressure and anxiety of resolving your first production issue. The endless hours spent debugging a complex system that just won’t work - until, at last, it does. And how that struggle itself is the point: it’s what transforms a beginner coder into a software engineer with real intuition.</description>
