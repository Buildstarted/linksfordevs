So a company called MyHeritage who provides automatic AI-powered photo enhancements is now offering a new service that can animate people in old photos creating a short video that looks like it was recorded while they posed and prepped for the portrait.</description>

      <description>One of the most time-consuming parts of application development is debugging. This already hard part of our day to day life can easily become a nightmare if the application crashes only on production and you cannot reproduce it on your local machine. Fortunately, we have .NET tools which can come really handy in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Why Massachusetts Struggled to Make a Vaccine Website</title>
      <link>https://www.zagaja.com/2021/02/vaccine-websites/</link>
      <description>In 1872, a fire broke out in the basement of a warehouse on Summer Street in Boston. As flames spread to nearby buildings, Boston firefighters called for backup. Neighboring towns responded, only to discover that their hoses would not fit into the hydrants. The couplings that connect the hydrants to the hoses had not been standardized. This hampered the help the firefighters could give, and thirty people died. 776 buildings burned. Fast forward to 2021. Companies and governments are trying to share information about vaccine appointments. Their systems cannot connect with each other. People cannot get shots. The death toll is ongoing. History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.</description>

      <title>ISO 8601: the better date format | Blog</title>
      <link>https://kirby.kevinson.org/blog/iso-8601-the-better-date-format/</link>
      <description>If you haven’t been living under a rock, you’ve probably heard that
there are different date formats in the world such as the American one
(mm/dd/yyyy) and the European one (dd.mm.yyyy). If you’re smart
enough, you’ve probably also noticed that the American one makes no
sense and is just awful. A simple conclusion that many people draw out
of this is that the European format is the best one, however I don’t
think this is true. If you’re one of these people who think so, I’m
here to (hopefully) change your mind by introducing you to a
lesser-known date format called ISO 8601.</description>

      <description>When Google users browse in “Incognito” mode, just how hidden is their activity?The  Alphabet Inc. unit says activating the stealth mode in Chrome, or “private browsing” in other browsers, means the company won’t “remember your activity.” But a judge with a history of taking Silicon Valley giants to task about their data collection raised doubts Thursday about whether Google is being as forthright as it needs to be about the personal information it’s collecting from users.At a hearing Thursday i</description>

      <title>Librsvg, Rust, and non-mainstream architectures</title>
      <link>https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/librsvg-rust-and-non-mainstream-architectures.html</link>
      <description>Almost five years ago librsvg introduced Rust into its source
code.  Around the same time, Linux distributions
started shipping the first versions of Firefox that also required
Rust.  I unashamedly wanted to ride that wave: distros would have to
integrate a new language in their build infrastructure, or they would
be left without Firefox.  I was hoping that having a working Rust
toolchain would make it easier for the rustified librsvg to get into
distros.</description>
