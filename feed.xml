      <title>A Spectre is Haunting Unicode</title>
      <link>https://www.dampfkraft.com/ghost-characters.html</link>
      <description>In 1978 Japan&amp;#39;s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry established the encoding that would later be known as JIS X 0208, which still serves as an important reference for all Japanese encodings. However, after the JIS standard was released people noticed something strange - several of the added characters had no obvious sources, and nobody could tell what they meant or how they should be pronounced. Nobody was sure where they came from. These are what came to be known as the ghost characters (幽霊文字).</description>

      <title>Programming can still be magical</title>
      <link>https://johv.dk/blog/magical-programming.html</link>
      <description>Computers used to be fun. Programming felt magical – it gave you the
ability to create something out of nothing. Over the last few decades, personal
computers have become increasingly impersonal, and programming has lost much of
that magic.</description>

      <title>Why Clojure?</title>
      <link>https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One piece of unattributed wisdom that&amp;#39;s stuck with me is &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t take more than one technology bet&amp;quot;. At Ladder, our big bet is using &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://clojure.org/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Clojure&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for fullstack app development. Ladder&amp;#39;s used Clojure since day 1 in 2015, and we wouldn&amp;#39;t want it any different! In particular, Clojure&amp;#39;s Lisp heritage, focus on pure functions and immutable data structures, unified client-server support, and superior developer experience have helped us write higher quality code faster.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <title>Observations and Imaginations — Note Taking Apps</title>
      <link>https://jself.net/posts/note-taking/</link>
      <description>About every year or so I decide to change note-taking apps. Or at least I change most of my notes to a new app. This time I&amp;#39;m going back to an old app, but because of a &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; note-taking paradigm. The one I&amp;#39;m going back to is Org Mode, but with a twist. In this post, I hope to look at some of the new ideas in note-taking and some of the apps available.</description>

      <title>17-313: Foundations of Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://cmu-313.github.io/</link>
      <description>Successful software projects require more than just technical expertise. Figuring out what the client wants, collaborating in a team, managing complexity, mitigating risks, staying on time and budget, and determining under various constraints when a product is good enough to be shipped are at least equally important topics that often have a significant human component. 17-313 explores these issues broadly covering the fundamentals of modern software engineering.</description>
