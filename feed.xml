      <link>https://teraku.de/posts/intention-in-language/</link>
      <description>Sometimes I think about what a bliss computers are. I don’t mean in a way of how they have improved our quality of life (which they did) and I’m not trying to disregard of the fact that they have had and will continue to have lots of implications on our social interactions and sociatal perception. What I mean is the fact that we now have these machines which obey exactly the way as we tell them to.</description>

      <description>I arrived to San Francisco in 1999 with six credit cards, a U-Haul truck tied to my used Jeep Cherokee and a singular dream – create a successful startup of my own with my Compaq laptop.

      <title>The Workhorse Group Story</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-workhorse-group-story/</link>
      <description>The Workhorse Group Incorporated is a EV company which primarily produces delivery vans and got lately popular with a rising share price because it was viewed as one of the possible winners of an 8 billion USPS contract to replace old delivery vans.
This contract busted, however I started writing this article before the deal busted - so don&amp;amp;rsquo;t be surprised by the high numbers.
I owned this stock for several years and wanna display my view of the company in this blog post.</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210224-00/?p=104901</link>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210222-01/?p=104890</link>
      <description>From anecdotal evidence, French is a very fragile language: The slightest deviation in grammar or pronunciation renders the language utterly incomprehensible. Example 1: The wife of my friend the rocket scientist studied French in school and loved all things French. He agreed to go on a bicycle tour of France with her.</description>
