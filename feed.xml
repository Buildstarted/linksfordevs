      <title>Blazor Workshop | NDC London 2022</title>
      <link>https://ndclondon.com/workshops/blazor-workshop/303dab0f548c</link>
      <description>Blazor is arguably the hottest technology in the .NET world right now, and for good reason. It brings the missing piece of the puzzle to ASP.NET—A true client-side UI framework which allows developers to author applications with C# instead of JavaScript. Since its initial release in September 2019, it&amp;#39;s grown massively in popularity as well as features. With .NET 6, developers will even be able to use their existing skills with Blazor to go beyond the web and create desktop applications!</description>

      <title>OPT: Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068</link>
      <description>Large language models, which are often trained for hundreds of thousands of
compute days, have shown remarkable capabilities for zero- and few-shot
learning. Given their computational cost, these models are difficult to
replicate without significant capital. For the few that are available through
APIs, no access is granted to the full model weights, making them difficult to
study. We present Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only
pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters, which we aim to
fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We show that OPT-175B
is comparable to GPT-3, while requiring only 1/7th the carbon footprint to
develop. We are also releasing our logbook detailing the infrastructure
challenges we faced, along with code for experimenting with all of the released
models.</description>

      <title>C#: Add event handlers dynamically using reflection</title>
      <link>https://mikehadlow.com/posts/event-handlers-by-reflection/</link>
      <description>Recently I had a situation where I needed to test a class with dozens of event handlers. Rather than manually write the repetitive code to attach the handlers I decided to cheat and use reflection. Since there wasn’t anything immediately available online that I could find, I’m sharing an example here to show how to do it.</description>
