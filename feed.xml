      <description>I&amp;#39;ve run into this problem a few times: I install a new Mac OS and then install the .NET SDK. A bit later I install a dotnet tool using `dotnet tool install -g` and then try to run it, only to find out that the SDK is not able find it. This post is a note to self on how to fix the pathing for .NET tools to be found correctly and to be able to run your dotnet tools.</description>

      <title>How AES Is Implemented</title>
      <link>https://blog.0x7d0.dev/education/how-aes-is-implemented/</link>
      <description>The AES algorithm is widely used today, whether it’s for encrypting a connection to a website, encrypting data on your hard drive, or storing passwords in your favorite password manager. It has been battle-tested for many decades and is still recommended as one of the most secure algorithms. In this article, I explain how AES encryption works and how the algorithm is implemented.</description>

      <title>Hidings Symbols Of Elf Files</title>
      <link>http://hkopp.github.io/2023/09/hidings-symbols-of-ELF-files</link>
      <description>This blog post describes how to hide symbols in ELF files from static
analysis.
While this may seem like a curious gadget, this approach is used in
the real world to prevent software from being analyzed, e.g., in software
protection mechanisms or malware.</description>

      <title>Developing OCaml with Nix</title>
      <link>https://ryan.freumh.org/blog/ocaml-nix/</link>
      <description>Lately,
I&amp;#39;ve been writing a significant amount of OCaml as part of my PhD.
Instead of using the OCaml package manager (opam) command-line interface
(CLI) for these projects, I prefer to use Nix to provide declarative and
reproducible development environments and builds. However I still want
to be able to interoperate with opam&amp;#39;s file format and access packages
from the opam repository. In this blog post we&amp;#39;ll walk through creating
a flake.nix file to do this for a hello world project at github.com/RyanGibb/ocaml-nix-hello.
Our aim is to make building an OCaml project, and setting up a
development environment, as simple as one command.</description>

      <title>Confidential Computing - ACM Queue</title>
      <link>https://queue.acm.org/issuedetail.cfm?issue=3623393</link>
      <description>Confidential Computing (CC) fundamentally improves our security posture by drastically reducing the attack surface of systems. While traditional systems encrypt data at rest and in transit, CC extends this protection to data in use. It provides a novel, clearly defined security boundary, isolating sensitive data within trusted execution environments during computation. This means services can be designed that segment data based on least-privilege access principles, while all other code in the system sees only encrypted data. Crucially, the isolation is rooted in novel hardware primitives, effectively rendering even the cloud-hosting infrastructure and its administrators incapable of accessing the data. This approach creates more resilient systems capable of withstanding increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, thereby reinforcing data protection and sovereignty in an unprecedented manner.</description>
