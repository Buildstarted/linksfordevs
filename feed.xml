      <description>Recently1 at work I found myself with an interesting problem in need of solving.
The problem was one stage of a larger algorithm, and we wanted to be able to run the whole algorithm in an optimization loop, so it was important that it was fast.</description>

      <description>How to Rob a Bank Yes I know the name of the post is very intriguing and you probably think I am throwing a tutorial on How to actually Rob Banks, but not really this blog comes from a story that I wanted to demonstrate with a little bit of images and demos, the Cayman Bank manifesto from Phineas Phisher [1] and some other APT examples, but also I wanted to demonstrate this in a fun scenario all in Virtual Machines and copying SOME of the techniques utilized for this Bank Hack.  This isn’t meant...</description>

      <title>Episode 58: Dometrain - with Nick Chapsas</title>
      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0058-dometrain/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I was joined for the second time by Nick Chapsas! This time, we chatted about his new Dometrain teaching platform. Nick started off creating courses on his own website, nickchapsas.com, which he’s recently rebranded to Dometrain and reached out to other authors to also create courses - myself included! I’ve recently released a Docker course on Dometrain, and we chatted about my experience doing this, as well as Nick’s story and motivations behind building Dometrain.</description>

      <title>NixOS Reproducible Builds: minimal installation ISO successfully independently rebuilt</title>
      <link>https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-reproducible-builds-minimal-installation-iso-successfully-independently-rebuilt/34756</link>
      <description>We have successfully created an independent, bit-by-bit-identical rebuild of the nixos-minimal ISO published by Hydra &amp;#127881;   Why is this useful? While there are a number of ‘side-benefits’, the main point of Reproducible Builds is that it gives us a reliable way to verify the binaries we ship are faithful to their sources, and have not been tampered with anywhere in the build pipeline (e.g. on Hydra).  For general information on Reproducible Builds see:     What exactly was reproduced? This me...</description>
