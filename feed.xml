      <title>Why it is hard to generate beautiful HTML emails (from Markdown)</title>
      <link>https://ewaldbenes.com/blog/why-it-is-hard-to-generate-beautiful-html-emails-from-markdown</link>
      <description>Developer-centric products often want to send newsletter with embedded code snippets. Some of them already write their documentation in Markdown. Why not write the newsletter in Markdown too and turn it into nicely formatted HTML email...!?</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from integrating with GPT in production</title>
      <link>https://philbooth.me/blog/lessons-learned-from-integrating-with-gpt-in-production</link>
      <description>For the last ten months or so
I&amp;#39;ve worked on integrating GPT (various flavours)
with a large production codebase.
It&amp;#39;s been one of the most chaotic periods of my career,
featuring numerous false starts,
changes of direction and
rapid improvements followed by major setbacks.
This is what I&amp;#39;ve learned.</description>

      <title>Every Phone Should Be Able to Run Personal Website</title>
      <link>https://rohanrd.xyz/posts/every-phone-should-be-able-to-run-personal-website/</link>
      <description>Back in 2009, anynone with a Nokia could have a personal website running on their own phone. Sadly this amazing piece of tech was never widely adopted. Today’s phone are far more powerful than those Nokias both in performance and battery backup and still we don’t see anyone running a server on their phone. Why?
I think this was never implemented on phones because there’s no incentive for large corporations to work on something like this.</description>

      <title>Non-determinism in GPT-4 is caused by Sparse MoE</title>
      <link>https://152334h.github.io/blog/non-determinism-in-gpt-4/</link>
      <description>It’s well-known at this point that GPT-4/GPT-3.5-turbo is non-deterministic, even at temperature=0.0. This is an odd behavior if you’re used to dense decoder-only models, where temp=0 should imply greedy sampling which should imply full determinism, because the logits for the next token should be a pure function of the input sequence &amp;amp; the model weights.</description>

      <title>Modular Monolith Communication Patterns</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/modular-monolith-communication-patterns</link>
      <description> Modular monoliths are becoming more popular in the software engineering community.
The allure of Microservices is becoming less compelling. We also have seasoned veterans of our industry saying you should reconsider:
&amp;gt; You shouldn&amp;#39;t start a new project with microservices, even if you&amp;#39;re sure your application will be big enough to make it worthwhile.
— Martin Fowler
Modular monoliths give you the logical architecture of Microservices without the operational complexity. You can safely determine the boundaries between modules. And refactoring is straightforward and less risky. They can also be easily migrated into Microservices if you decide to do so.
I&amp;#39;ve built and maintained several Modular monolith systems in the past years.
In this week&amp;#39;s newsletter, I want to focus on the communication patterns in the Modular monolith architecture.
But first, let me explain what is a Modular monolith.</description>
