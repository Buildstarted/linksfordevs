      <title>Using Architecture Tests for CancellationTokens and sealed classes</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/feac44f3-2c6e-4994-80c3-e2a17efbb8f3</link>
      <description>Architectural Unit tests are nice to constraint your system (like which parts of your application can access other parts of your application). This blog post is not about that - that is covered a lot in the internet. No, I want to show what I did in a recent project: Checking if all controllers do use CancellationToken and some other entities are sealed.

      <title>The challenge of deleting old online accounts</title>
      <link>https://loudwhisper.me/blog/deleting-accounts/</link>
      <description>A few days ago I decided to continue working on a project I am planning (and
barely executing) for quite a while: my “Digital Resiliency Plan.” I am planning
to write about this here eventually, but essentially it’s just a nice
way to say “get my stuff in order” when it comes to digital data, especially
in terms of safety of the data (e.g., backups) and the ability to maintain access
to it in most circumstances.</description>

      <title>placing functions</title>
      <link>https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/placing-functions/</link>
      <description>About a year ago I observed that in-place construction seems surprisingly
simple.
By separating the creating of the place in memory from writing the value to
memory, it’s not that hard to see how we can turn that into a language feature.
So about six months ago, that’s what I went ahead and did and created the placing crate: a proc-macro-based prototype for “placing functions”.</description>

      <title>Three HTTP versions later, forms are still a mess</title>
      <link>https://yorickpeterse.com/articles/three-http-versions-later-forms-are-still-a-mess/</link>
      <description>The last few weeks I've been working on adding an HTTP 1.1 stack to the standard
library of Inko as part of this pull
request. The work is still ongoing
but the initial set of changes will include an HTTP 1.1 server, client, basic
cookie handling, generating and parsing of forms, and a request router. This
work is based on the following RFCs:</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reasoning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734</link>
      <description>Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency. Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems.</description>
