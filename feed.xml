      <title>LIVE CODING - WordPress Migration to Blazor - PART 4</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=u9TkOP5pvYg</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s time! WordPress on AWS LightSail has been non-stop problems for nearly 2 years now.

Time for a change.

I&amp;#39;ll be looking into using LinkDotNet.Blog by Steven Giesel as my blog engine of choice. But migrations are never easy, so this will be the first of many sessions trying to figure out how I can get my blog setup before going live.

Remember -- I need to keep as many links active as possible so I don&amp;#39;t ruin my SEO!

      <title>Rails 8.0: No PaaS Required</title>
      <link>https://rubyonrails.org/2024/11/7/rails-8-no-paas-required</link>
      <description>Deploying modern web apps – with all the provisions needed to be fast and secure while easily updateable – has become so hard that many developers don’t dare do it without a PaaS (platform-as-a-service). But that’s ridiculous. Nobody should have to pay orders of magnitude more for basic computing just to make deployment friendly and usable. That’s a job for open source, and Rails 8 is ready to solve it. So it’s with great pleasure that we are now ready with the final version of Rails 8.0, after a successful beta release and several release candidates!</description>
