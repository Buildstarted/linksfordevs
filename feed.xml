      <title>Copyrighting all the melodies to avoid accidental infringement | Damien Riehl | TEDxMinneapolis</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/sJtm0MoOgiU</link>
      <description>In the litany of copyright infringement lawsuits, technology lawyer and musician Damien Riehl demonstrates that music is merely math, and has a finite number of possible melodies. If you’ve ever thought a song you like sounded similar to another, the culprit may not be an unethical forger, but rather the limited mathematical musical equations that our favorite artists have to work with.  Current copyright law is at risk of severely limiting future music creation and future human creativity. This talk suggests a new way to handle these legal cases.  Damien Riehl is a technology lawyer with a B.S. in music. After beginning to code in 1985, and for the web in 1995, he has worked for the chief judges of state and federal courts; litigated for a decade; taught law-school copyright classes; and led teams in software development, digital forensics, proactive cybersecurity, reactive cybersecurity incidents, and world-scale investigations. Damien’s combined experience in the law, technology, and music has inspired his most recent project—copyrighting billions of unique melodies. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx</description>

      <description>The advent of the personal computer wasn’t just about making these powerful machines available to everyone, it was also about making them accessible and usable, even for those lacking a computer science degree. Larry Tesler, who passed away on Monday, might not be a household name like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, but his contributions to making computers and mobile devices easier to use are the highlight of a long career influencing modern computing.</description>

      <title>Multi-Perspective Validation Improves Domain Validation Security - Let's Encrypt - Free SSL/TLS Certificates</title>
      <link>https://letsencrypt.org/2020/02/19/multi-perspective-validation.html</link>
      <description>At Let’s Encrypt we’re always looking for ways to improve the security and integrity of the Web PKI. We’re proud to launch multi-perspective domain validation today because we believe it’s an important step forward for the domain validation process. To our knowledge we are the first CA to deploy multi-perspective validation at scale.
Domain validation is a process that all CAs use to ensure that a certificate applicant actually controls the domain they want a certificate for.</description>

      <title>Latacora - Stop Using Encrypted Email</title>
      <link>https://latacora.singles/2020/02/19/stop-using-encrypted.html</link>
      <description>Email is unsafe and cannot be made safe. The tools we have today to encrypt email are badly flawed. Even if those flaws were fixed, email would remain unsafe. Its problems cannot plausibly be mitigated. Avoid encrypted email.
Technologists hate this argument. Few of them specialize in cryptography or privacy, but all of them are interested in it, and many of them tinker with encrypted email tools.
Most email encryption on the Internet is performative, done as a status signal or show of solidarity.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite features of modern web development is Middleware. Middleware is a powerful abstraction that can encapsulate your intent, enrich an incoming request, enhance an outgoing response, or do all the above. Once you embrace Middleware as a potential approach to solving problems, it becomes second nature to think in that paradigm.</description>

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khn7sDUSEJM</link>
      <description>Blazor is a new web UI framework that has become one of the headline features of .NET Core 3 and beyond. It lets you build rich interactive user experiences in C# and Razor, offering the benefits of a single-page app (SPA) framework while keeping all your code and data in .NET.

      <title>Debuggers &amp; Domains | My Notes: Using Azure AD and MSAL for Application Authentication</title>
      <link>https://debuggers.domains/post/msal-app-auth/</link>
      <description>When building an internal application you probably have authentication and authorization needs. If you already have a Single Sign On (SSO) provider like Auth0 or Okta then you are in pretty good hands as they both have great documentation and features to support these kinds of scenarios. For the rest of us, we need to get creative and use the tools we already have available. For some of us Azure AD may be that tool. If your business is already using Office 365 or Azure you may be able to use Azure AD to meet your internal authentication needs. To add convenience, you may even already have your desired users entered in Azure AD and organized into groups.</description>

      <title>From DotNet Run to Hello World - .NET Oxford - January 2020</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=378nXIxGAoU</link>
      <description>From ‘dotnet run’ to “Hello World” - Matt Warren

Have you ever stopped to think about all the things that happen when you execute a simple .NET program?

This talk will delve into the internals of the recently open-sourced .NET Core runtime, looking at what happens, when it happens and why.

Making use of freely available tools such as 'PerfView', we'll examine the Execution Engine, Type Loader, Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler and the CLR Hosting API to see how all these components play a part in making 'Hello World' possible.



Matt is a Microsoft MVP based in UK, and a C# dev who loves nothing more than finding and fixing performance issues. He’s worked with Azure, ASP.NET MVC and WinForms on projects for storing government weather data, medical monitoring devices and an inspection system that ensured kegs of beer didn’t leak! He’s previously been an Open Source Contributor to BenchmarkDotNet and RavenDB, nowadays he mostly blogs about the ‘Internals’ of the .NET Runtime at http://mattwarren.org. Matt currently works on the Contrast Security and lives near Pinewood Film Studios (home of James Bond) with his wife and 2 kids.

      <title>Jakub Míšek - Compiling and Running a PHP on .NET Core - Dotnetos Conference 2019</title>

Jakub Míšek is a veteran .NET developer and co-founder of iolevel, where he is maintaining and developing the PeachPie compiler platform. Jakub holds a Master's degree in Software Engineering from the Charles University in Prague, where he is also pursuing his PhD.

C# and the .NET Framework have been providing the support for dynamic objects for years already. The reflection API has been improved significantly in .NET Core. So what if we put all this together in order to improve a real dynamic language by running it on top of .NET? The compiler and the runtime have to work together. Also, we have to find a way of implementing the rest of the language’s dynamic features in the most performant way. Let’s talk about how “dynamic” actually started thanks to PHP, how to implement the dynamicity with a custom made compiler on Roslyn, and what are the achievements of such an approach.</description>

      <title>Application Diagnostics in .NET Core 3.1 - Damian Edwards &amp; David Fowler</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6CjlnwPhHQ</link>
      <description>What do you do when your .NET Core application doesn’t behave the way you expect? Maybe it’s slower since the last deployment or has started crashing at the worst possible times. How do you analyze the issue when your application is running in someone else’s data center on the other side of the planet? On Linux? In a container?

Damian and David from the .NET team will demonstrate ways to diagnose issues in .NET Core 3.1 applications, using new APIs, command line tools, and features of Visual Studio, to gather information, analyze it, and fix root causes.

      <title>SignalR Deep Dive: Building Servers - David Fowler &amp; Damian Edwards</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL9nLAjCPtM</link>
      <description>You’ve likely already seen that SignalR supports multiple client types, including .NET, JavaScript, and Java. But what about the server side? Could we build a SignalR server in something other than .NET? Go perhaps, or Node.js? If so, what would you learn? Why would you do it? How would you even begin?

In this session, David and Damian from the ASP.NET team will explore what goes into building a SignalR server that can speak to any SignalR client. You’ll come away with a better understanding of exactly how SignalR works, and perhaps even ideas on how to extend SignalR further for your needs.

SSW's Matt Wicks interviews Troy Hunt on his website 'Have I been Pwned'.

They discuss:

 - The internals of Have I Been Pwned
 - What technologies are used to minimize the cost of running the service
 - How Troy uses Cloudflare as a CDN (to use Azure less and avoid big $$$)
 - The how and why it's safe to check if your password has been pwned
