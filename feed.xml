      <title>OTCC : Obfuscated Tiny C Compiler</title>
      <link>https://bellard.org/otcc/</link>
      <description>My goal was to write the smallest C compiler which is able to compile
itself. I choose a subset of C which was general enough to write a
small C compiler. Then I extended the C subset until I reached the
maximum size authorized by the contest: 2048 bytes of C source
excluding the &amp;#39;;&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;{&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;}&amp;#39; and space characters.</description>

      <description>Julia 1.0 came out well over 2 years ago.
Since then a lot has changed and a lot hasn’t.
Julia 1.0 was a commitment to no breaking changes, 
but that is not to say no new features have been added to the language.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Large-Scale Image Recognition Without Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06171</link>
      <description>Batch normalization is a key component of most image classification models,
but it has many undesirable properties stemming from its dependence on the
batch size and interactions between examples. Although recent work has
succeeded in training deep ResNets without normalization layers, these models
do not match the test accuracies of the best batch-normalized networks, and are
often unstable for large learning rates or strong data augmentations. In this
work, we develop an adaptive gradient clipping technique which overcomes these
instabilities, and design a significantly improved class of Normalizer-Free
ResNets. Our smaller models match the test accuracy of an EfficientNet-B7 on
ImageNet while being up to 8.7x faster to train, and our largest models attain
a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 86.5%. In addition, Normalizer-Free
models attain significantly better performance than their batch-normalized
counterparts when finetuning on ImageNet after large-scale pre-training on a
dataset of 300 million labeled images, with our best models obtaining an
accuracy of 89.2%. Our code is available at https://github.com/deepmind/

      <description>This article shows you how create and run custom availability tests using Azure Functions. This is an update to the blog post about monitoring WebJobs using Application Insights, since Microsoft is deprecating the Load Test and Performance features, this is the recommended alternative for monitoring availability. To get started you need to create an Azure function in C# with Timer Trigger. You can choose the trigger interval based on your requirement. This is one of the main advantage compared to Application Insights availability test feature. Next you need to add following packages.</description>

      <title>Why do we write design documents?</title>
      <link>https://blog.royalsloth.eu/posts/why-do-we-write-design-documents/</link>
      <description>Starting a greenfield project is loads of fun, but you can’t avoid
the dentist’s appointment indefinitely and at some point you will have to write
that design document your boss expects to see on their table. Despite the fact that most people
learned how to write in childhood, more often than not they are struggling
when it comes to writing lengthy documents. The big blank page is daunting
and it’s hard to get into the mood for writing, because it’s time consuming and
not as fun as programming.</description>

Diminishing trust in these institutions makes way for alternatives and new forms of storytelling, conversation, and analysis to accompany transactions, ledgers, and hashes. Media is</description>

      <title>The complexity that lives in the GUI</title>
      <link>https://blog.royalsloth.eu/posts/the-complexity-that-lives-in-the-gui/</link>
      <description>The user interfaces are a weird thing. There are all sorts of libraries and frameworks that
are supposed to help you on your journey of writing a GUI, but despite all the best practices and
frameworks forcing you to eat your vegetables, the GUI always ends up being a ridiculous mess.
After pondering some more about this topic, I’ve finally realized what is the cause of this problem.</description>
