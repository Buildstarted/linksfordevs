      <description>How many AI agents and LLM&amp;#39;s does it take to change a lightbulb? LLM&amp;#39;s are a very hot topic right now, but can we use them in a real business scenario? In this episode, community MVP Johnny Hooyberghs returns to the panel to show us how to use Semantic Kernel, Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Services to integrate an LLM-based AI with your own code to perform more complex tasks like sending emails, updating databases, ordering tickets, and much more!

      <link>https://yasoob.me/posts/setting-up-listmonk-opensource-newsletter-mailing/</link>
      <description>Hi everyone! &amp;#128075;
I have been using Mailchimp for my mailing list for a while and even though it is great, it is super expensive. I have 5000+ people in my list and that puts me in their $78 plan. I send the newsletter very rarely and don’t really earn anything from the mailing list so it was really hard for me to justify the $78. I had recently integrated Amazon SES with a project and found out that SES gives you a free 50,000 email sending quota per month.</description>
