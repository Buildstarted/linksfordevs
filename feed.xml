      <title>A Bug-Sized Camera for Bug-Sized Robots and Bug-Sized Bugs - IEEE Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/uw-micro-camera</link>
      <description>As if it’s not hard enough to make very small mobile robots, once you’ve gotten the power and autonomy all figured out (good luck with that), your robot isn’t going to be all that useful unless it can carry some payload. And the payload that everybody wants robots to carry is a camera, which is of course a relatively big, heavy, power hungry payload. Great, just great.</description>

      <description>After using Brave for almost a year, I can extract some stats from its usage over time:  152,906 trackers blocked 2,26GB of bandwidth saved &amp;amp;quot;2,1 hours saved&amp;amp;quot; (no clue how this is calculated)  But more importantly, I made some bucks! In Brave browser you can opt-in to the Brave Rewards program, which enables a BAT (Basic Attention Token) Wallet where the funds will be stored  Through the third-party service uphold com you can manage those funds and withdraw them   I can&amp;#39;t say that the ads were very relevant all the time, but certainly more accurate to my interests than other ads showed on the Web  Nevertheless, in the last year I managed to gather 13,5 $ (11,5 €)!
