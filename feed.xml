      <description>Idempotency doesn&amp;#39;t get the attention it deserves.

It enables a distributed system to be both resilient and performant.

If, like us, you’re building low-latency APIs and face significant penalties for breaching SLAs, this article may be worth your time.

      <title>Beat the Drum</title>
      <link>https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/beat-the-drum</link>
      <description>My former COO gave me a
piece of advice when I became a manager. He said that leaders have to deliver
the same message again and again and again to make sure it gets through to
everyone in the organization. Sometimes, it’s also necessary to simplify the
message and lose some nuance for it to actually sink in. The advice made sense
to me at the time, but it became more concrete to me as I tried to apply it and
as I noticed when leaders above me failed to do it. I brought it up to my former
COO recently, and he put it in a fantastically pithy way by saying “yep, you
have to beat the drum.”</description>

      <title>The First Ten Years</title>
      <link>https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2025/01/30/first-ten-years/</link>
      <description>In 2012, I started teaching myself programming. Around this time, I read Peter Norvig’s essay, Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years. Norvig’s thesis is that learning to program takes much more time than people like to admit. I found this a comforting voice of reason in a time when “just learn to code” felt like a cultural mantra. Norvig gave me license to slow down.</description>

      <link>https://www.watchesofespionage.com/blogs/woe-dispatch/casio-f91w-diving-underwater-pressure-test</link>
      <description>Brands like Rolex and Omega will often tout their deepsea capabilities with the Rolex Deepsea Challenge rated to 11,000 meters (36,090 feet) and the Omega Ultra Deep coming in at a lesser but still ridiculous 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) of theoretical water resistance. But what about a cheap Casio often associated with terrorists and hipsters? With around $15 and some engineering know-how, can an affordable watch also venture into the deep ocean?</description>

      <link>https://woodruff.dev/no-tracking-queries-speed-up-your-ef-core-like-a-pro/</link>
      <description>Imagine you’re at a library, flipping through books at lightning speed. You don’t need to write notes in the margins or keep tabs on which books you’ve touched—you’re just reading. That’s what no-tracking queries are in EF Core: a way to grab data without keeping track of changes. It’s fast, lightweight, and perfect for read-only operations. But wait, there’s more! Let’s throw identity resolution into the mix, a smart way to avoid duplicate entities when working with no-tracking queries. Together, they make a dynamic duo for blazing-fast data fetching, significantly reducing the time it takes to retrieve data from the database.</description>

Are we... doomed? I don&amp;#39;t think so, but let&amp;#39;s dive into it.

Struggling with webhook performance? In this video, we&amp;#39;ll tackle one of the biggest challenges in modern web applications: scaling webhook processing. I&amp;#39;ll show you how to identify and fix common bottlenecks using RabbitMQ and MassTransit, transforming your webhook architecture from a potential system bottleneck into a robust, scalable solution. We&amp;#39;ll start by demonstrating common webhook problems, then dive deep into implementing a message queue-based solution with RabbitMQ, and finally explore how to properly structure your application using MassTransit for reliable message processing. Whether you&amp;#39;re handling dozens or thousands of webhook events, this step-by-step guide will show you the industry-standard approach to building a production-ready webhook system.
