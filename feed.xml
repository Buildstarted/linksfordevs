      <title>Things That Didn&amp;#39;t Kill My App</title>
      <link>https://jake.nyc/words/things-that-didnt-kill-my-app/</link>
      <description>The day SongRender launched, there was a bug that prevented files from uploading. I found out when my first paying customer’s videos failed to render. Since the files had never left his computer, there was no way for me to fix it for him. I had to ask him to email the files to me so I could manually render his videos. (He was very gracious).
Another time, I messed up the Netlify configuration for serving the website, so visitors were greeted by a blank white trendy minimalist page. To make matters worse, I had also misconfigured the uptime checker. It took a full day for me to realize the site was down.</description>

      <link>https://bldavies.com/blog/auctioning-vaccines/</link>
      <description>Pancs (2020) proposes an auction for vaccines in which people can bid on others’ behalf.
