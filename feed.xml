      <title>Learn C# with CSharpFritz - Ep 7:  The Errata Report No. 1</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFGfu7NTumI</link>
      <description>In this 7th episode of C# with CSharpFritz, Jeff goes back to talk about some of the language features that were skipped over the previous episodes.  We talk about increment operators, string formatting and interpolation, the continue statement, and the challenging discussion of what a struct is and when to choose a struct or a class in C# object design.

Interactive Notebook with samples you can run IN BROWSER at:  https://aka.ms/csharpfritz_notebooks_2020

After the C# basics sessions are completed, which user interface framework do you want Fritz to walk through FIRST?  Vote for your favorite with an emote at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/issues/13

Questions:
00:36:29 - Are anonymous functions possible in string interpolation?
00:38:40 - Can you write list.ForEach() statement in string interpolation?
00:59:24 - Do you need to use the &amp;#39;var&amp;#39; keyword when returning an &amp;#39;out&amp;#39; parameter?
01:07:52 - Can a struct bigger than the stack?
01:14:21 - Is there a C# 9 features overview stream scheduled?
01:19:09 - How is memory managed when you have List as a property of a struct?
01:20:43 - It seems like structs has lot of limitations. Can you please give an example of using structs?
01:46:39 - Can one property be static in a non static class?

      <description>Propaganda, Censorship, and Surveillance are attributes of the same underlying aspect: Monopoly and Centralised Control.
All three problems have the same effective solution: Break up the monopolies.
Propaganda is a function of amplification, attention, audience capture, selective promotion, discovery, distraction, stealing the air supply or acquiring of any competion, and co&amp;#246;ption of the platform.  Propaganda is an inherent property of monopoly control.
Censorship and Gatekeeping are functions of excludability, audience gating, selective exclusion, obfuscation, distraction, stealing the air supply or acquiring of any competion, and, again, co&amp;#246;ption of the platform.  Censorship is an inherent property of monopoly control.
Surveillance whether of the state, capitalist, or non-state actor varieties, is a function of population and provider capture, coercion or gatekeeping of vendors and pipelines, and, again, co&amp;#246;ption of the platform.  Surveillance is an inherent property of monopoly c...</description>

      <title>Answering some basic questions about registering applications on Azure Active Directory</title>
      <link>https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/answering-basic-questions-about-aad-app-registrations/</link>
      <description>These past years I worked with a few companies that uses Azure Active Directory to perform authentication and authorization on their line-of-business (LOB) applications and from time to time I get questions about how to register apps on AAD.
Those questions are always pretty similar and most of the time the problem lies in some misconception, so I thought it might be a good idea to try to answer some of them and at the same time write them down in this post.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Queries with Expressions Trees in C# - Michael&amp;#39;s Coding Spot</title>
      <link>https://michaelscodingspot.com/dynamic-queries/</link>
      <description>In this article, you&amp;#39;ll see how frameworks like Entity Framework and MongoDB C# driver use expressions trees to make that conversion. And you&amp;#39;ll see how to use expression trees yourself to build dynamic queries. Those are queries that you aren&amp;#39;t able to create at compile time because you&amp;#39;ll know how the query should look like only at runtime.</description>

      <description>Stripe is a well-known innovator in digital payments. They attacked one of the most intimidating and locked-down markets, and made it look like child’s play. They have a compounding competitive edge in processing payments more efficiently for their customers, and the best-crafted APIs in the entire industry. Stripe is admired on these grounds, and more: they have their own press, in line with their thoughtful, public intellectual staff.</description>

      <title>YARP: The .NET Reverse proxy</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IqQkNcsqWE</link>
      <description>Reverse proxies can help simplify how clients access your backend services. YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) is designed as a library that provides the core proxy functionality which you can customize to fit your application’s specific needs.

In this episode, Jeremy chats with Chris Ross and Sam Spencer about why they decided to start working on YARP. They show us some demos of various YARP features like live reloading, authorization policies and more.

[01:13] - What is the goal of YARP?
[02:04] - What’s the difference between a load balance vs reverse proxy?
[05:04] - Setting up YARP in an ASP.NET Core application
[06:39] - Reviewing the route configuration
[11:25] - Supporting TLS termination
[13:23] - Live reload for configuration
[14:33] - Dynamically updating configuration
[17:04] - Service Mesh?
[18:58] - Using ASP.NET Core authorization policies
[20:31] - Getting started with Yarp

      <title>14,000x Speedup - James Hiebert&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>http://james.hiebert.name/blog/work/2015/09/14/CS-FTW.html</link>
      <description>In my job as a scientific software developer, I tend to write a lot of code. And most people who haven’t been through a Computer Science degree tend to think that CS is “just” about slinging code at the screen and then running it. I have a good working relationship with many of my colleagues and co-workers with other backgrounds… Physics, Climate Science, Biology, etc. But when it comes to developing software, I get the distinct impression that people think, “Hey, how hard could this be?! We just write down a few instructions about what we want the computer to do, hit the execute button and the, ‘Blamo!’, we get our answer!”</description>
