      <title>Replicating Uber Delivery UI in .NET MAUI</title>
      <link>https://askxammy.com/replicating-uber-delivery-ui-in-net-maui/</link>
      <description>Howdy! &amp;#128129;‍♀️&amp;#160;I am thrilled to share my article for the .NET MAUI UI July 2023 calendar created by Matt Goldman, during the month of July, this calendar will publish various educational contributions created by industry experts about .NET MAUI. In this article, I will guide you step-by-step in building the Uber Delivery screen in a simple way. Let&amp;#39;s get started!




 Before starting, to get the best out of the post, I’ll leave you some instructional notes so that you have a better experience reproducing the UI:
 At the beginning, you will see an image with the original UI where you will see divided into blocks as we’ll be working on each part of the design.
 Each block presents the image with the design explicitly that we’ll be working on that block, they are highlighted in a box.
 In each of the code blocks, you can see a comment that says:&amp;#160;“Here add the code that is being explained in the next block“. To keep you as focused as possible, this part indicates to you that the next block code explanation goes right where the comment line is added.
 I will not be using styles so that the properties added to the various components can be seen and understood faster in the explanation process.

Let’s start!
Let’s divide the original design into blocks
To better understand, I have divided the original design into blocks, which are listed in the order in which we will be reproducing each one, these are:

First, let’s define the main layout we’ll be using!
In this case, we will use a Grid to structure the screen as you can see in the following code block:



Let&amp;#39;s begin with the Main image block. To better understand the explanation, we will develop each element of this block individually. The following are the elements:

➖ Image: To begin, we will incorporate the food image with a colored background, which will be directly assigned to the Image control itself. Follow the steps below to do so.

➖ Close Button: Above the previously added image, in the upper left corner, we inserted a circular button. This button has a very important feature: its circular shape.
To achieve a circular shape, you can set the WidthRequest and HeightRequest properties to the same value, and then set the CornerRadius property to half of that value. For more details on how to create circular buttons, we recommend reading the article “Easy way to create a circular button.”
&amp;#160;







Let’s continue with the “Delivery Information” block, this one is made up of the following elements:


➖Delivery title and description:

➖Profile image: This is a rounded image, achieved using the AvatarView from the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit. For more details on how to implement it, please refer to this article.

➖ Delivery instructions:&amp;#160;

➖ Call button: Use the same technique explained in the previous rounded button.

➖ Separator line: In this case, I used a BoxView to create the line, but you can also use the .NET MAUI line shape.





Finally, we just need to add two elements to complete this block: a divider line and a button to rate the order. You can implement this as shown below:







And our Uber Delivery UI&amp;#160;&amp;#160;is done! .
Thanks for ready! &amp;#128075; See you next time! &amp;#128154;&amp;#128149;

      <link>https://devlinduldulao.pro/the-bangladesh-bank-heist-a-lesson-in-cybersecurity/</link>
      <description>The Bangladesh Bank heist in February 2016 was one of the most infamous cybercrimes in history. Criminals attempted to steal nearly $1 billion from the central bank of Bangladesh, successfully making off with $81 million. While this event sent shockwaves across the global financial system, it also serves as a stark reminder of the importance of strong cybersecurity measures. In this blog post, we’ll explore the details of the heist and discuss ways to prevent such incidents in the future.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://fanpu.io/blog/2023/score-based-diffusion-models/</link>
      <description>Score-based diffusion models are a promising direction for generative models, as they improve on both likelihood-based approaches like variational autoencoders, as well as adversarial methods like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  In this blog post, we survey recent developments in the field centered around the line of results developed in (Song &amp;amp; Ermon, 2019), analyze the current strengths and limitations of score-based diffusion models, and discuss possible future directions that can address its drawbacks. Joint work with Owen Wang.</description>

Any printable ASCII character is permitted for the attribute name.
More importantly, on the restrictions section
Some DNS server implementations place limits on the size or number of TXT records associated with a particular owner. Certain implementations may not support TXT records at all.
However in rfc4408 section-3.</description>
