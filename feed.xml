      <title>Preliminary notes on analyzing Disk and File I/O performance with ETW traces | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201125-00/?p=104480</link>
      <description>Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a powerful tool for blah blah blah. (Sometimes I get tired of writing the introduction.) Here’s a little diagram of how I/O happens. This diagram is not 100% accurate, but it’ll do for the purpose of today’s discussion.</description>

      <title>Reliably Save State &amp;amp; Publish Events (Outbox Pattern)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8fOnxAxKHk</link>
      <description>What&amp;#39;s the Outbox Pattern? A reliable way of saving state to your database and publishing a message/event to a message broker.

Why do you need it? When you get into messaging, you will often find code that needs to save state to your database, and then publish an message/event to a message broker.  Unfortunately because they are two different resources, you need a distributed transaction to make these atomic.  There is another option to use the Outbox Pattern which does not require a distributed transaction and most messaging libraries support it.

      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Nov/24/Upgrading-to-NET-Core-50</link>
      <description>Over the last week I spent some time upgrading several .NET Core Web applications and libraries from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 5.0. I&amp;#39;m happy to say that this was always a non-event as the process went very smooth for once. In this post I&amp;#39;ll talk about what I found and also offer some commentary why we should celebrate this update and push Microsoft to continue along this path.</description>

Because my own Mailserver has lately problems (downtimes) I wanna explore other possibilities of hosting my email addresses.
So let&amp;amp;rsquo;s take a look&amp;amp;hellip;
Self-hosting (VPS, Tools like Mailcow, Mailu, etc) You simply setup a Mailserver with software like Mailcow, Mailu or Mail-in-a-Box on a virtual Server and manage it yourself.</description>

      <description>Ahhh, interfaces! Also known as APIs / protocols / behaviours / your-favorite-languages-jargon-term-here. The source of plenty of pain, much rejoicing, and far too much discussion. I plan on contributing, here and now, to that third category.</description>

      <title>How do people find bugs?</title>
      <link>https://cryptologie.net/article/511/how-do-people-find-bugs/</link>
      <description>You might wonder how people find bugs. Low-hanging fruit bugs can be found via code review, static analysis, dynamic analysis (like fuzzing), and other techniques. But what about deep logic bugs. Those you can’t find easily. Perhaps the protocol implemented is quite complicated, or correctness is hard to define, and edge-cases hard to detect. One thing I’ve noticed is that re-visiting protocols ar ...</description>

      <title>On the bonkers color palette of Garfield comics</title>
      <link>http://wondermark.com/garfield-color/</link>
      <description>
I’ve been reading Garfield comics with my son this week. He’s too young to really follow the narratives — after every strip he pauses, asks what happened, and then says, slowly and calmly, “Why” — but he’s already very fond of the drawings and characters. We’ve&amp;#160;been&amp;#160;reading specifically late-80’s strips, since those are the books we […]</description>

      <title>What was it like to be a software engineer at NeXT? Did workers interact with Steve Jobs?</title>
      <link>https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-be-a-software-engineer-at-NeXT-Did-workers-interact-with-Steve-Jobs?share=1</link>
      <description>I started in 1990 after the Education focussed first hardware and software arrived kinda DOA in the market. The back parking lot was for the engineers in Building 2 at Seaport. There was a Ferrari parked back there with a vanity plate MIPS 1#, where I later learned 1# was the engineer’s employee # at the first commercial RISC computer company. Not bad I thought. Steve had two black 911 Turbos parked in the front lot of Building 1. I had upended the UNIX industry and had been hired, I figured, to supertune the OS. Instead I supertuned their language, its runtime, and the Foundation library that all apps start with. Its still the DNA that runs a billion devices. Working at NeXT was like riding in employee 1x’s 3rd Ferrari at Laguna Seca - every year we would have a gut wrenching all hands meeting where some new drastic turn of the corporate funding death spiral would play out. Then a mad sprint in a new direction! We lost our custom hardware. The any workstation you want sprints (solaris, hp, alpha) didn’t pan out. The Microsoft tax (later judged monopolistic, too late, as Ray Noorda of Novell confessed to me as had happened to him) killed our PC business. We ditched the OS and ran on Windows. We sold our source code to Sun to make a multiplatform OpenStep. No cigars. (They made Java out of it using many of our/my ideas) What was such a blast was the atmosphere of cultivated invention. Every year we would have NSPW, National (NEXT?) Small Programming Week where we would all try writing some code to try out the hottest new thing. Like EOF, our database layer that still puts Ruby-on-Rails to shame. The Web was happenin’ (invented as you may recall on a NeXT workstation) and we lost Brian Pinkerton to his WebCrawler search engine company (~1994). WebTV took others. Tivo. Ariba. Another engineer had a brainstorm over a weekend and suddenly we had our own Web Server technology called WebObjects. Unrequested, he thought he might get fired, or maybe it was his I’m gonna work on this whether you fire me or not. It was way cool. It still didn’t sell much. I had another one of my own brainstorms, the JavaBridge, and over a weekend the one colleague I had told it to on Friday had coded most of it up! We sold it up, and Craig Federighi insisted I code up the JavaBridge version of WebObjects instead of his team. Wow. It sold. Enough to go IPO again. ‘Cept Apple bought us. Steve was way cool. I hung up on him by accident when he called to recruit me. He called back. He also called me at my desk after I crawled back in after my wife died and asked me what I was going to do about my 13 month old son (his son Reed was about the same age). How could he help, he asked. We worked it out. That call. OMG. One of my early contributions at NeXT was this tech called Distributed Objects and somebody in the field funded a version of it (PDO) to run on Solaris, and suddenly we were on Wall Street ‘cause Solaris was where the data was and NeXT was the visualizer workstation front end. Our first $1m sale!! Steve demoed PDO on stage with lasers shooting around the audience!! Everyone at NeXT has their Steve stories. It was, obviously, part of the draw. I remember being brought into a meeting once specifically to tell him why something he wanted was impossible, and man, it took like 90 seconds ‘cause he was brilliant. At some point he ventured into my office and left me with a zen like zinger: “be careful ‘lest you be accused of that which I am often accused: arrogance.” Inside NeXT we gave it our best. A small few of us, strong, opinionated, always pulling together as we raced against the funding clock. It was, as I’ve tried to explain, a haphazard journey to success based on great minds collaborating and challenging each other to succeed. With the best CEO on the planet. Lasers.</description>
