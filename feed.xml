      <title>Exploring generating PDF files from HTML in ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/364/exploring-generating-pdf-files-from-html-in-asp-net-core</link>
      <description>Back in 2008, I wrote a 
series of articles 
about using iTextSharp to generate PDF files in an ASP.NET application. I 
still use iTextSharp in a large MVC 5 application that I&amp;#39;m in the process of

migrating to ASP.NET Core. The version I use is very old (4.1.6), and the 
API is very low level so it takes quite a while to write the code required to generate 
even a moderately complex PDF. Ideally I need a replacement for the new 
application that can generate PDF files purely from HTML, which is an API I&amp;#39;m 
much more comfortable with. This ancient version of iTextSharp doesn&amp;#39;t support 
HTML as a source of content. In this article, I consider some alternatives.</description>

      <title>Mutual Contact Discovery</title>
      <link>https://blog.xot.nl/2022/09/27/mutual-contact-discovery/index.html</link>
      <description>Messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp offer a contact
  discovery service that allow you to discover which of the
  contacts in your address book are also a member. Depending on the
  implementation, this creates certain privacy risks. Even though Signal uses a
  protocol involving a trusted execution environment to mitigate the
  risk, an inherent risk of (one-sided) contact discovery remains: if
  someone (a patient, an ex) has your phone number in their address
  book, they will be notified when you join Signal. Not necessarily what
  you expect when joining a messaging service that focuses on privacy.
  This motivated me to study mutual contact discovery, where
  users of a messaging app can only discover each other when
  both have each other’s phone number in their address
  book.</description>
