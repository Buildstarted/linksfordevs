      <description>A year ago I tried using an M1 iMac for work duty but its 21&amp;quot; screen took up too

      <title>2FA or not 2FA | Alexander Mikhailian</title>
      <link>http://mikhailian.mova.org/node/295</link>
      <description>A few weeks ago I received an unsolicited email from the Belgian Center for Cyber Security.
It starts with the statement that 80% of cyber attacks could be avoided if 2FA was active and then says literally that If you only use a username and password for your remote logins, you&amp;#39;re a sitting duck.</description>

There are several frameworks to build such TUIs, e.g. ratatui for Rust or textual for Python. In the following article, I will describe the development of a TUI using the textual framework.</description>

      <description>Everyone’s talking about AI, NLP and LLMs these days, and, to be honest, so are we!
Recently, we’ve been exploring how LLMs can help us make sense of the massive amount of vulnerability data we collect and improve vulnerability management—while always remembering that AI is just a tool, not a solution on its own!
The picture below gives a glimpse of what we’ve tested so far.

Disclaimer: I am the founder of Memotron, a direct competitor to Obsidian.
Despite the fact that I am the founder of Memotron, I am not writing this to solely support the app which we built. This essay explores the questions that arose in my mind when I first came across the File over app article. In fact, I am a huge admirer of really good tools like Obsidian, Notion etc.</description>

      <title>The FFT Strikes Back: An Efficient Alternative to Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18394</link>
      <description>Conventional self-attention mechanisms incur quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability on long sequences. We introduce FFTNet, an adaptive spectral filtering framework that leverages the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve global token mixing in $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time. By transforming inputs into the frequency domain, FFTNet exploits the orthogonality and energy preservation guaranteed by Parseval&amp;#39;s theorem to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. A learnable spectral filter and modReLU activation dynamically emphasize salient frequency components, providing a rigorous and adaptive alternative to traditional self-attention. Experiments on the Long Range Arena and ImageNet benchmarks validate our theoretical insights and demonstrate superior performance over fixed Fourier and standard attention models.</description>
