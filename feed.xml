      <title>An example of overengineering - keep it WET</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/example-overengineering/</link>
      <description>This week’s post is pretty short. I’ve already written about overengineering, but this adds a personal touch. I had to rewrite my Jet Train demo to use another data provider, switching from a Swiss one to a Bay Area one. One of the main components of the demo is a streaming pipeline. The pipeline: Reads data from a web endpointTransforms data through several stepsWrites the final data into an in-memory data grid Most of the transform steps in #2 enrich the data.

      <title>Rage bug reporting : ezyang’s blog</title>
      <link>http://blog.ezyang.com/2021/04/rage-bug-reporting/</link>
      <description>At Facebook, we have an internal convention for tooling called &amp;quot;rage&amp;quot;. When something goes wrong and you want to report a bug, the tool developer will typically ask you to give them a rage. For a command line tool, this can be done by running a rage subcommand, which will ask about which previous CLI invocation you&amp;#39;d like to report, and then giving you a bundle of logs to send to the developer.</description>

      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/how-to-nginx-reverse-proxy-with-docker-compose/</link>
      <description>This article will discuss about configuring nginx reverse proxy for aspnet core apps with Docker compose. Today I took as session on Introduction to Docker Containers one of the question I received was how to run multiple instances of a container and load balance them. So in this blog post I am creating multiple instances of a ASP.NET Core Web API and load balance them with the help of nginx. Nginx is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.</description>

      <description>Today I learned in 2021 Living in the internet age, one tends to get overwhelmed with (often useless) facts on a daily basis. Fueled by hundreds of articles and studies via my RSS reader, social media, podcasts, journals and other content providers, I meet more disposable knowledge than my brain can process.

      <title>The Compiler Writer Resource Page</title>
      <link>https://c9x.me/compile/bib/</link>
      <description>I know complete pans of the literature are left
out, but this is a page for amateur compiler
writers.  Anything that I did not find practical is
not listed here. (I also did not include the things
that I do not yet know!)
All the remarks in grey and even the selection of
documents are personal.  If you have suggestions of
papers to include, please contact me! Finally, the
order of items in the various sections is totally
arbitrary.</description>
