      <title>Writing An App In 2 Days</title>
      <link>https://noahgilmore.com/blog/transparent-app-icons/</link>
      <description>This September, I developed and released an iOS app called Transparent App Icons. I wrote the app (or at least, the app&amp;#39;s initial version) very quickly, and it&amp;#39;s paid off in terms of the time I put into it - in addition to being a great learning experience from a technical and business perspective, it&amp;#39;s generated $3,000 in proceeds since launch, which means it&amp;#39;s the first app I&amp;#39;ve put on the App Store which will contribute nontrivially to my paycheck...</description>

      <title>Cognitive biases</title>
      <link>https://lemire.me/blog/2020/12/16/cognitive-biases/</link>
      <description>One-sided bet: People commonly assume implicitly that their actions may only have good outcomes. For example, increasing the minimum wage in a country may only benefit the poor. Taking a lottery ticket only has the upside of possibly winning a lot of money. Believing in God can only have benefits. And so forth. In truth, … Continue reading Cognitive biases</description>

      <description>Recently, I was wondering how large code bases look like when it comes to
the basic properties compiler might care about. And here I am not thinking about
dynamic properties, but simply static properties such as length of methods,
number of methods per class, number of fields, and so on.</description>

      <title>Unit testing and mocking with Azure SDK .NET | Azure SDK Blog</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/unit-testing-and-mocking/</link>

      <title>Data Deficient Messages</title>
      <link>https://ardalis.com/data-deficient-messages/</link>
      <description>In distributed applications and microservices that send events or notifications to other apps or services, take care to include sufficient information in the messages themselves. Failure to do so will likely result in downstream services needing to call back to request additional details. This can result in a flood of incoming requests responding to each message, essentially denial-of-service attacking the source app.</description>

      <description>A federal appeals court ruled yesterday that people have the right to surreptitiously record police officers at work in &amp;quot;public spaces&amp;quot; such as parks, agreeing with two local activists that the First Amendment takes precedence over a state law banning private recording in that circumstance.

      <title>Preview in macOS Big Sur is irreversibly destroying PDFs – again – Annoying Technology</title>

      <description>This image has three components: On the left is an OCR’ed PDF from my ScanSnap iX500. I have selected most of the text, and on the right side you can see two copy&amp;amp;paste results. In the upper half is the result directly after scanning, right after the bundled ABBYY FineReader that comes with the iX500 did its magic. In the lower half is the result after modifying (removed a blank page) and saving that same PDF in Preview.</description>
