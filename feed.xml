      <title>Lightweight alternatives to Google Analytics</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/822568/61d29096a4012e06/</link>
      <description>More and more web-site owners are concerned about the "all-seeing Google"
tracking users as they browse around the web. Google Analytics (GA) is a 
full-featured web-analytics system that is available for free and, despite the privacy
concerns, has become the de facto analytics tool for small and large web sites
alike. However, in recent years, a growing number of alternatives are helping
break Google's dominance. In this article we'll look at two of the lightweight
open-source options, namely GoatCounter and Plausible. In a subsequent article,
we'll look at a few of the larger tools.</description>

      <title>Sleep Hygiene For Software Engineers</title>
      <link>https://sklum.github.io/2020/06/14/sleep-hygiene-for-software-engineers.html</link>
      <description>Software engineers know the importance of sleep; posts extolling its virtues (or the problems associated with its absence) regularly reach the front page of HackerNews. In fact, around the time I finished this post there were two articles on the front page: Fitful nightly sleep linked to chronic inflammation, hardened arteries and Why Sleep Deprivation Kills. Yikes! There‚Äôs invariably a comment on sleep-related posts saying something to the effect of, ‚ÄúI know getting good sleep is important, but I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm not sleeping well and I don‚Äôt know how to resolve it even if I did!‚Äù. Academia offers little help as there‚Äôs only a handful of studies focusing on sleep solely for the software engineer.</description>

      <description>Last week, I decided to start tackling a problem I've had for a long, long time. Brain fog. It's been getting worse over the years - to the point that I don't realise time has gone by. I forget things instantly. A tipping point was recently being unable to work out a profit margin (rather embarrassing for all concerned!).</description>
