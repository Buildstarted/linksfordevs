      <title>MySQL IFNULL is tricky</title>
      <link>https://atalaykutlay.com/if-null-is-tricky.html</link>
      <description>I started the new year with a very puzzling bug. One of the users of my internal dashboard tool told me that he doesn’t see some of the rows he expected to see. I checked the query that populated the view, which had various filters but none of them looked suspicious, expect one of them. There was an IFNULL looking at me in the query which smelled awful.</description>

      <title>Why does L1 regularization encourage coefficients to shrink to zero? – Madiyar’s Page</title>
      <link>https://maitbayev.github.io/posts/why-l1-loss-encourage-coefficients-to-shrink-to-zero/</link>
      <description>Regularization is a common method for dealing with overfitting in Machine Learning (ML). The simplest and most widely used methods are L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge). The L1 and L2 regularizations are well covered in numerous tutorials and books. However, I could not find any good geometric or intuitive explanation of why L1 encourages coefficients to shrink to zero. This post tries to address this.</description>

      <title>My Deep-cut Book Recs | Marcus&amp;#39; Blog</title>
      <link>https://mbuffett.com/posts/deep-cut-book-recs</link>
      <description>Here are some lesser-known books I’ve loved, that you won’t find in typical recommendation lists – the deep-cuts.
Replacing Guilt: Minding Our Way This book is all about the role of guilt. When is it useful, when is it not, what can be done about it.
This could have easily been packaged like a best-selling pop-psychology book – padded to 200 pages with a sampling of the same anecdotes we’ve all read 100 times, fitting a narrative to the life of a celebrity or two to lend credibility, and repeating the same core message a hundred times. Instead it felt like reading a well-organized journal entry. I both respect the author for taking the path less traveled, and love the format for its own sake. I wish more books like this existed. It’s sort of in a class of its own.</description>

      <title>Programming a GPU on bare metal</title>
      <link>https://macoy.me/blog/programming/PiGPU</link>
      <description>I virtually attended Handmade Seattle 2024, where Mason Remaley presented &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s Not About the API&amp;quot; (link eventually), which discussed Vulkan. There was a question about how the buffer data layouts work on the GPU, and the speaker didn&amp;#39;t have a clear answer. I don&amp;#39;t want to come across as criticizing Mason by saying this; rather, I&amp;#39;m saying this kind of low-level information on GPUs is hard to come by because their internals are rarely revealed or discussed.</description>

      <title>Emulating the FMAdd Instruction, Part 1: 32-bit Floats [JoshJers&amp;#39; Ramblings]</title>
      <link>https://drilian.com/posts/2024.12.31-emulating-the-fmadd-instruction-part-1-32-bit-floats/</link>
      <description>A thing that I had to do at work is write an emulation of the FMAdd (fused multiply-add) instruction for hardware where it wasn&amp;#39;t natively supported (specifically I was writing a SIMD implementation, but the idea is the same), and so I thought I&amp;#39;d share a little bit about how FMAdd works, since I&amp;#39;ve already been posting about how float rounding works.</description>

      <title>Think Beyond Synchronous: The Ultimate Guide to Tasks in C# - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/think-beyond-synchronous-the-ultimate-guide-to-tasks-in-c/</link>
      <description>Imagine you’re cooking dinner. You handle both tasks simultaneously instead of waiting for the water to boil before chopping vegetables. That’s the power of asynchronous programming in C#: enabling your programs to perform multiple operations concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness. The Task class, a cornerstone of modern .NET development, is at the heart of this capability.</description>

      <title>mjg59 | The GPU, not the TPM, is the root of hardware DRM</title>
      <link>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/70954.html</link>
      <description>As part of their &amp;quot;Defective by Design&amp;quot; anti-DRM campaign, the FSF recently made the following claim:Today, most of the major streaming media platforms utilize the TPM to decrypt media streams, forcefully placing the decryption out of the user&amp;#39;s control (from here).This is part of an overall argument that Microsoft&amp;#39;s insistence that only hardware with a TPM can run Windows 11 is with the goal of aiding streaming companies in their attempt to ensure media can only be played in tightly constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Layered vs Modular vs Microservices... Which One is Best for You?</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=rbaJNyR5m5A</link>
      <description>In this talk, we will discuss major software architectures (Layered, Modular and Microservices) and explain which one is suitable for what type of projects and teams, as well as the pros and cons of each architecture. We will compare these approaches and also explore ABP’s startup solution templates to start with each solution type easily.</description>

The Fluent builder pattern is a powerful creational design pattern that offers a structured approach to constructing complex objects. It provides a solution to the telescoping constructor problem by encapsulating the logic for object creation in a separate builder class. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with objects that have numerous optional parameters or when the object construction process involves multiple steps. In C#, the Builder pattern can be implemented with a fluent interface, resulting in a highly expressive and readable API. This approach allows developers to chain method calls, creating a more intuitive and flexible way of constructing objects.

This video tutorial will guide you through the process of implementing the fluent builder pattern in C#. You&amp;#39;ll learn how to create a builder class, implement method chaining, and construct complex objects step by step.</description>
