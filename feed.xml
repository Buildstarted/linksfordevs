Redesigned Logo    This design is made up of all of the LLVM letters arranged into a wyvern dragon.    The logo performs well at small sizes without modification.

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/lets-make-visual-studio-even-more-accessible-together/</link>
      <description>When I started leading the drive for accessibility in Visual Studio five years ago, I really didn’t understand the magnitude of what that meant. In all honesty, I hadn’t really thought about accessibility as more than keyboard and screen reader, but we’ve come to learn that it’s a lot more than that.</description>

      <title>How to process large file?</title>
      <link>https://nanxiao.me/en/how-to-process-large-file/</link>
      <description>In&amp;#160;Process large data in external memory, I mentioned: Update: Split large file into smaller ones, and use multiple threads to handle them is a good idea. I want to elaborate how to process large file here: (1) Split the large file into small ones which are independent from each other. E.g., based on users. Then you can spawn multiple threads to process each small file. (2) For the output: if all threads output to same file, the write operations must be atomic and it will become bottleneck of the program. So every thread should have its own output file. (3) After all threads exit, main thread can use&amp;#160;cat&amp;#160;or other methods to consolidate all output files into one.</description>

      <title>Stepping Back from Speaking</title>
      <link>https://martinfowler.com/articles/202106-reducing-speaking.html</link>
      <description>Giving talks has been one of the pillars of my career. I’ve given keynotes at software events all over the world. Some of these talks have tens, even hundreds, of thousands of views on youtube. I keep being asked back, so I assume I do a pretty decent job. But those who don’t know me well are often surprised when they learn the most important thing about my speaking profession.</description>

      <description>Twitter is making a controversial change to its web application. Until recently, Twitter on the web allowed users to easily switch between an algorithmic feed and a chronological feed with a single click, but that option is now being removed completely for people who use Twitter in their browser.

      <title>How to Work Hard</title>
      <link>http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html</link>
      <description>It might not seem there&amp;#39;s much to learn about how to work hard.
Anyone who&amp;#39;s been to school knows what it entails, even if they
chose not to. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And
yet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I
was in school, the answer is definitely yes.</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210629-00/?p=105378</link>
      <description>For simplicity, let’s say you have a single-CPU system that supports “dynamic frequency scaling”, a feature that allows software to instruct the CPU to run at a lower speed, commonly known as “CPU throttling”. Assume for this scenario that the CPU has been throttled to half-speed for whatever reason,</description>
