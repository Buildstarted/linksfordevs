      <title>A thanks to the traits working group in 2021</title>
      <link>https://jackh726.github.io/rust/2022/03/25/a-thanks.html</link>
      <description>So…this is awkward. I wanted to write this post near the end of 2021 or beginning of 2022, but time got away from me, as it does so often. However, a half-completed draft has been open in my browser this entire time, and I think it’d be a shame for it to go to waste and not celebrate all the work done on traits working-group related things and to celebrate the people who have done that amazing work. Given that this is “unofficial” though, I’ll be a little less formal than I otherwise would if this was posted to the Inside Rust Blog.</description>
