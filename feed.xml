      <title>OTP in Your Password Manager Is Not 2FA</title>
      <link>https://cedwards.xyz/otp-in-your-password-manager-is-not-2fa/</link>
      <description>It’s quite common now for password managers to have a feature to store OTP secrets and generate TOTP/HOTP codes. In my opinion, this is antifeature that shouldn’t exist and it encourages bad security.</description>

      <title>Audio Recording on the Web is Broken</title>
      <link>https://jimmythecricket.com/blog/audio-recording-on-the-web-is-broken</link>
      <description>TL;DR: The MediaRecorder API creates WebM files that can't be navigated through (seeked) because they lack duration metadata. Use the open-source fixwebmduration library to solve this, but we really need a better native solution.</description>

      <title>Will MCP stay for the long term?</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2025/03/26/mcp-standard-llm</link>
      <description>MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. Based on the context, AI agents can decide which tools to use, in what order, and how to chain them together to accomplish a task. MCP also introduced a human-in-the-loop capabilities for humans to provide additional data and approve execution. With the right set of MCP servers, users can turn every MCP client into an “everything app.”</description>

      <description>Honestly I’d stop if I could, but I just get carried away. After making a compiler for tmux, then solving sudoku, then playing video I wasn’t planning on making a game. These things just happen to you. Well maybe not to you, but they happen to me. Unlike the video player, this isn’t just rendering Snake inside tmux. The entire game—input, game logic, and rendering—is done using tmux config files. You just load tmux with this config, and you’ll have...</description>

      <title>Infrastructure as Markdown?</title>

      <description>Ever had a complex Python function you wanted to quickly host as an API? Managing dependencies like databases, secret keys, or heavy utilities like audio processing libraries can be quite cumbersome. Typically, I handle this with a pattern involving: Docker: to manage and install dependencies AWS Parameter Store: to securely...</description>

      <title>You should know this before choosing Next.js</title>
      <link>https://eduardoboucas.com/posts/2025-03-25-you-should-know-this-before-choosing-nextjs/</link>
      <description>Picking the technology stack for a project is an important and consequential decision. In the enterprise space in particular, it often involves a multi-year commitment with long-lasting implications on the roadmap of the project, the pace of its development, the quality of the deliverables, and even the ability to assemble and maintain a happy team.The open-source software model is a fundamental answer to this. By using software that is developed in the open, anyone is free to extend it or modify it in whatever way fits their use case. More crucially, the portability of open-source software gives developers and organisations the freedom to move their infrastructure between different providers without fear of getting locked in to a specific vendor.This is the expectation with Next.js, an open-source web development framework created and [governed by Vercel](https://nextjs.org/governance), a cloud provider that offers managed hosting of Next.js as a service.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Code » Half-life of Microsoft products is 7 years</title>
      <link>https://shape-of-code.com/2025/03/23/half-life-of-microsoft-products-is-7-years/</link>
      <description>I get a lot of pushback from developers/managers when I tell them that the average application has a relatively short lifetime, i.e., half-life of 4-8 years.  The pushback kicks in when I start citing data, up until then my listeners appear surprised/skeptical.  The fact that source code has a brief and lonely existence is accepted, but telling them about the (one study) evidence that a coding mistake is more likely to disappear because of an unrelated coding change than as a result of fixing a fault report appears to make them feel uncomfortable.</description>

      <title>Nostalgia — bayindirh</title>
      <link>https://blog.bayindirh.io/blog/nostalgia/</link>
      <description>The people I'm following on the internet put me inside a small but vibrant retrocomputing bubble. When this is combined with the synthwave composers I tend to listen lately, I'm being transported to my earlier years on this planet, repeatedly. The fact that I have grown with a Commodore 64, 486 systems, boomboxes and big Hi-Fi racks makes this a rather harsh, but enjoyable ride every time.</description>

      <title>Hartwork Blog · How much security is in long-term support?</title>
      <link>https://blog.hartwork.org/posts/how-much-security-is-in-long-term-support/</link>
      <description>Everyone loves the idea of long-term support
— LTS for short —
where a vendor promises you to provide security updates for a few years:
little friction and strong security.
Does long-term support live up to that dream?
It does not.
What makes me say that?</description>

      <title>Ski itinerary optimization</title>
      <link>https://www.alexandercogneau.com/posts/ski-path-optimization/</link>
      <description>Every year, my wife and I go skiing in the French Alps.
This time, we set our sights on something ambitious: skiing 100 kilometers in a single day. On a typical day, with breaks and a leisurely pace, we cover 40 to 50 kilometers.
So 100 felt like a stretch, but not impossible. The lifts run from roughly 9-17, giving us only eight hours. To make it work, we needed to properly plan for it.</description>

To change from the usual chat application examples, here’s how to implement server notifications in Java with Spring Webflux.</description>
