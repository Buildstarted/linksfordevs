      <title>An update on the UMN affair</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/854645/334317047842b6c3/</link>
      <description>On April 20, the world became aware of a
research program conducted out of the University of Minnesota (UMN) that
involved submitting intentionally buggy patches for inclusion into the
Linux kernel.  Since then, a paper resulting from this work has been
withdrawn, various 
letters have gone back and forth, and numerous patches from UMN have been
audited.  It&amp;#39;s clearly time for an update on the situation.</description>

      <title>C++ coroutines: Adding COM context support to our awaiter | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210429-00/?p=105165</link>
      <description>You may want to have awaiters that apply custom resume behavior. For example, in Windows, you are likely to want your awaiter to preserve the COM thread context. For X11 programming, you may want to the awaiter to return to the render thread if the co_await was initiated from the render thread.</description>

      <link>https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2021/04/vertical-turbines-far-more-efficient-in-large-scale-wind-farms/</link>
      <description>A study from Oxford Brookes University researchers has found that vertical wind turbine design is considerably more efficient than the traditional form factor in large-scale wind farms, and in a certain arrangement can increase performance by up to 15 per cent.</description>

      <title>how to read stuff posted online – Snakes and Ladders</title>
      <link>https://blog.ayjay.org/how-to-read-stuff-posted-online/</link>
      <description>Very few sites on the internet are meant to facilitate reading — most are, in fact, designed to inhibit reading. Imagine watching a movie and having the image regularly shrink to a tiny size, overwhelmed by a much larger advertisement which also plays its sound at double the volume of the movie’s sound — that’s what reading a corporate site is usually like. (I hope you will have noticed that I try to make this blog easily readable on large and small screens alike. Also, perhaps, that I have recently added a button to enable dark mode.)</description>

      <title>My First Month as a Solo Founder</title>
      <link>https://frankgroeneveld.nl/2021/04/28/first-month-as-solo-founder/</link>
      <description>On the first of april I started my first full-time month as the solo founder of Webindie. I’ll try to build a bootstrapped software-as-a-service product that should get me to ramen profitability in a year. Having previous experience running an agency was a huge help so far. Lots of entrepreneurial jobs such as doing taxes, requesting a business bank account, apply for a business credit card, and registering at the chamber of commerce were at least vaguely familiar to me. The development and hosting side of Webindie shouldn’t be a problem either, as at my previous position I’ve been developing and hosting Ruby on Rails web applications for 10+ years.</description>
