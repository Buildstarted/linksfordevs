      <title>A Type of Useless</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-type-of-useless</link>
      <description>TypeScript offers certain advantages over JavaScript. Compile time type-checking can catch a lot of errors, it can move faster than browsers, so it offers the latest standards (and the compiler handles the nasty details of shimming them into browsers), plus it has a layer of convenient, syntactic sugar.

If you’re using TypeScript, you can use the compiler to find all sorts of ugly problems with your code, and all you need to do is turn the right flags on.

Azure Cognitive Services (opens new window) is a family of APIs that provide AI capabilities out-of-the-box, without the need to create algorithms and train them with massive amounts of data. There are Cognitive Services that translate text into another language or synthesize text to speech, others that recognize faces and objects in images and many more.</description>

      <title>Entity Framework Community Standup - EF Core 5.0 Collations</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgMhLVa_VfA</link>
      <description>In this community standup, we&amp;#39;ll be showing new features around case sensitivity and collations in 5.0. We&amp;#39;ll also provide a glimpse into how these features were designed, and what considerations and constraints guide the EF team - performance, cross-database support, usability and more. Come see how we design EF features under the hood!

      <title>Organize Code by Feature | Vertical Slices</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRns0rqPonA</link>
      <description>Stop thinking of horizontal layers and start thinking about vertical slices.  Can you tell what an application does by looking at it&amp;#39;s file structure? What functionality it provides?  Tired of navigating through a pile projects and folders to implement a new feature?  Stop organizing by technical concern and start organizing by features and capabilities.  This means looking at your application in vertical slices rather than horizontal layers

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201028-00/?p=104404</link>
      <description>As I noted some time ago, in the Windows Runtime, objects are represented at the ABI by a pointer to their default interface. The choice of default interface is usually obvious, but on occasion, the non-obvious choice may be better. If your runtime object supports only one interface,</description>
