      <title>RCE in Visual Studio Code&amp;#39;s Remote WSL for Fun and Negative Profit</title>
      <link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2021-12-20-rce-in-visual-studio-codes-remote-wsl-for-fun-and-negative-profit/</link>
      <description>The Visual Studio Code server in Windows Subsystem for Linux uses a local
WebSocket WebSocket connection to communicate with the Remote WSL extension.
JavaScript in websites can connect to this server and execute arbitrary commands
on the target system. Assigned CVE-2021-43907 and -5 USD bounty (the cost
of the EC2 machine to host the proof-of-concept).
It&amp;#39;s really funny that PlayStation paid 15K USD for almost the same
bug with 2.2 million subscribers (it was out of scope in their
program, too), but MSFT doesn&amp;#39;t pay for an official extension with more than 10
million installs (obviously, not every install is unique) for one of their most
popular products. But you are not here to listen to my rants. So, read on.</description>

      <description>In the interest of security and privacy, Apple on macOS Monterey has added a prominent orange dot to display outputs when audio capture is active. That renders their machines unusable for live visual performance, though, since it&amp;#39;s also shown on external displays. Dear macOS team - we urgently need a fix here.</description>
