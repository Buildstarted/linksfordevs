      <description>Unlike network based streaming applications, Looking Glass does not use any form of compression or color space conversion, all frames are transferred to the viewer (client application) in 32-bit RGBA without any transformations or modifications. This is possible through the use of a shared memory segment which enables extremely high throughput low latency guest to host communication.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), run for the public&amp;amp;rsquo;s benefit. It is a service provided by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG).
We give people the digital certificates they need in order to enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites, for free, in the most user-friendly way we can. We do this because we want to create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web.

      <link>https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/04/24/Algorithm-Agility</link>
      <description>What happened was, I was fooling around with zero-knowledge proof ideas and needed to post public keys on the Internet in
    textual form.
    I picked
    ed25519 keys (elliptic-curve, also known as EdDSA) so I asked the Internet
    “How do you turn ed25519 keys into short 
    text strings?” The answer took quite a bit of work to find and, after I posted it, provoked a discussion about whether I was
    doing the right thing. So today’s question is: Should these things be encoded with the traditional PKIX/PEM serialization, or
    should developers just blast the key-bits into base64 and ship that?</description>
