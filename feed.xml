      <title>Install Serial Drivers for ESP32 (macOS, Windows, Linux)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDxP4O4Trk</link>
      <description>Before you can program the ESP32, you need to install a driver for the USB-to-UART chip. Depending on your board that might be the CH340 or CP210x chip.

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buFKeqbafDI</link>
      <description>Use PlatformIO's dependency manager to automatically install and update any Arduino library you want to use.

No need to code everything yourself because there are so many Arduino libraries available for various sensors and devices. LCD display? Temperature sensor? A library probably exists already!

      <description>Quickly debug your sketches with the Arduino Serial Monitor. See the value of variables and learn how to use the built-in plotter of the Arduino IDE.

I've used this countless of times to visualize values of a new sensor that I'm testing. Seeing data in visual way is often much easier to interpret and make sense of.

      <title>Deep sleep: Use RTC memory to store data (ESP32 + Arduino series)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij-hjzv6QKY</link>
      <description>In deep sleep, the ESP32 powers down its main memory so all the contents is lost. You can, however, save some data in RTC memory. This is kept powered on during deep sleep and is ideal to keep some data around for when the ESP32 wakes up later.

      <title>Deep Sleep &amp; Other Power Modes (ESP32 + Arduino Series)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyvpRYfWjkY</link>
      <description>The ESP32 can consume a lot of power when you keep it running at full speed. Here, I'll go over all the different modes that allow you to reduce power consumption and save your battery.

The best way is by using one of the sleep modes, such as Deep Sleep mode. In this mode, the entire CPU is powered down and only a clock is running so the board can wakeup after a certain period of time.

      <title>Wakeup From Sleep With a Timer (ESP32 + Arduino series)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vln1NXpd77s</link>
      <description>You can't let the ESP32 be in deep sleep forever. At some point you need to wake it up and the easiest way is by using a timer.

Learn how to configure your board so it will automatically wakeup after a certain periode of time. For instance: you can sleep for 15 minutes, wakeup, make a temperature measurement and go back to deep sleep.
