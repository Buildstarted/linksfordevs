      <title>Introducing swift-erlang-actor-system</title>
      <link>https://forums.swift.org/t/introducing-swift-erlang-actor-system/81248</link>
      <description>I'm excited to share a new actor system we've been building for Swift's distributed actors: swift-erlang-actor-system.  This actor system enables Swift programs to join a distributed Erlang cluster.  Here's an example of a simple chat program using the actor system:  Demo Video  Erlang (and other languages that run on its VM) can connect multiple runtime systems together with distributed Erlang. Each runtime is referred to as a "node". Erlang also supports "C nodes", which allow a program other ...</description>

      <title>Qwen3-Coder: Agentic Coding in the World</title>
      <link>https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-coder/</link>
      <description>GITHUB HUGGING FACE MODELSCOPE DISCORD
Today, we‚Äôre announcing Qwen3-Coder, our most agentic code model to date. Qwen3-Coder is available in multiple sizes, but we‚Äôre excited to introduce its most powerful variant first: Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct ‚Äî a 480B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts model with 35B active parameters which supports the context length of 256K tokens natively and 1M tokens with extrapolation methods, offering exceptional performance in both coding and agentic tasks. Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct sets new state-of-the-art results among open models on Agentic Coding, Agentic Browser-Use, and Agentic Tool-Use, comparable to Claude Sonnet 4.</description>

      <description>Today, the United States informed Director-General Audrey Azoulay of the United States‚Äô decision to withdraw from UNESCO.

      <title>Jujutsu For Busy Devs | maddie, wtf?!</title>
      <link>https://maddie.wtf/posts/2025-07-21-jujutsu-for-busy-devs</link>
      <description>Jujutsu (jj) is a version control system with a
significantly simplified mental model and command-line interface compared to Git, without
sacrificing expressibility or power (in fact, you could argue Jujutsu is more powerful).
Stacked-diff workflows, seamless rebases, and ephemeral revisions are all natural with jj, and it
uses Git as a backend, which means you can begin using it non-destructively with a single command
and can always drop back down to Git if you need to.</description>
