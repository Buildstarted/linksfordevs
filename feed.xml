      <title>The Most Confusing Grep Mistakes I&amp;#39;ve Ever Made</title>
      <link>https://blog.robertelder.org/top-5-grep-mistakes/</link>
      <description>In this article, I&amp;#39;ll discuss 5 very confusing mistakes that have caused me to waste significant amounts of time when using the command-line tool known as &amp;#39;grep&amp;#39; to search for things. &amp;#160;I have chosen to document these mistakes in detail because they are mistakes that beginners are very likely to make at some point, but also to know be able to debug on their own. &amp;amp;nsbp;The root causes of these mistakes are: &amp;#160;Not knowing what flavour of regular expression that grep is currently using (and/or not understanding what features that flavour supports); Not considering the escaping rules of your shell; Issues with character encodings.</description>

      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/add-natural-language-understanding-to-your-bot-part2/</link>
      <description>This blog post is about adding natural language understanding to your bot. Language Understanding (LUIS) is a cloud-based API service that helps you to recognize the intent of user input and better direct the conversation flow. In the previous post I configured LUIS and in this post I will explain how we can use the LUIS service in a Bot Application.</description>

      <title>Underjord | The BEAM marches forward</title>
      <link>https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html</link>
      <description>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don&amp;#39;t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn&amp;#39;t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I&amp;#39;d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</description>

      <title>Life and Death of a Linux Process</title>
      <link>https://natanyellin.com/posts/life-and-death-of-a-linux-process/</link>
      <description>This post contains a rough sketch of the life and death of a process on Linux. It is a first-order approximation only. A later post will refine this further and provide a more precise description, adding details about pid namespaces, obscure syscalls, and little known flags.
Birth Every time a process is created, really another process split itself using the fork or clone syscall. After forking, processes usually run the execve syscall to swap the currently executing binary with another one.</description>

      <description>I recently watched a few videos on YouTube about the latest and greatest LEGO sets. I didn’t do it because I’m super interested in LEGO (that was a while ago) but because the YouTube algorithm decided that I had to. I naturally obeyed. The results were as expected: I felt old and none of those sets triggered any kind of “I need to have this” response. Until I saw this:</description>

      <title>A Productive Productivity System</title>
      <link>https://mrbalihai.github.io/2020/11/05/a-productive-productivity-system.html</link>
      <description>I’ve tried many different systems and tools over the years: Getting Things Done (GTD), todo.txt, Taskwarrior, Org Mode to name a few. One thing I’ve discovered is that productivity systems are like dieting; you feel really motivated when starting out but after a few weeks the enthusiasm starts to wane and you quickly start to fall out of practice. I’ve been trying GTD on and off for several years now but failed to really gel with it meaningfully. The one I’ve had the most success with so far is Bullet Journaling. I want to add that I’m not Bullet Journaling on the same level as all these creative hand drawn Instagram masterpieces you see; my approach is very much messy, minimal and functional. I follow most of the principles outlined on the Bullet Journal Website: a dot for a task, a dash for a note, a small circle for an event, each day has it’s own heading, once a task is complete I put a cross through the dot, if I carry forward a task the dot becomes an arrow, if the task is no longer relevant I put a line through it. I suspect the reason this has worked so well for me is because it’s the first time I’ve tried hand-written notes rather than a digital system and perhaps if I had tried hand written lists with GTD it would have been equally successful.</description>

      <description>Nicole Archambault believes we can scale back on learning to code and we should ramp up on learning problem solving. She believes this so much she&amp;#39;s launched a whole online course - Newbie Coder Problem Solving School - that teaches tons of problem solving skills...with not a single line of code! Is this possible? A good idea? We find out this week!</description>
