      <description>A few months ago I bought a featureless cube of tungsten. It’s 1.5 inches across and cost $130, but I argue it was one of the best purchases I’ve made recently.</description>

      <title>Adding support for $count segment in $filter collections in OData WebAPI</title>

      <description>Introduction In OData core&amp;#160; v7.9.0 we added improved support for $count segment in $filter collection properties. $filter=navProp/$count($filter=prop gt 1) gt 2 $filter=collectionProp/$count($filter=prop gt 1) gt 2 Previously, versions of OData core had support for: $filter=navProp/$count gt 2 $filter=collectionProp/$count gt 2 We are constantly improving filtering capabilities in OData WebAPI.</description>

      <title>Support for fetching nested paths in OData Web API</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/odata/support-for-fetching-nested-paths-in-odata-web-api/</link>
      <description>Background OData services use nested paths to access properties or entities related to a resource. For example, if you want to access orders of a given customer, you would use a request path like: http://localhost:8080/Customers/1/Orders Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData 7.x provides two main approaches for handling such requests: convention and attribute routing.</description>

      <description>A few days ago someone allegedly paid $1.3 million for a rock. It’s not even a real rock, or a picture of a real rock.

But it’s not about the rock, and we’re… Continue reading It’s not about the rock</description>

      <description>For whatever reason, the alpine-glibc project is apparently being used in production.&amp;#160; Worse yet, some are led to believe that Alpine officially supports or at least approves of its usage.&amp;#160; For the reasons I am about to outline, we don’t.&amp;#160; I have also proposed an update to Alpine which will block the installation of the glibc packages produced by the alpine-glibc project, and have referred acceptance of that update to the TSC to determine if we actually want to put our foot down or not.&amp;#160; I have additionally suggested that the TSC may wish to have the Alpine Council reach out to the alpine-glibc project to find a solution which appropriately communicates that the project is not supported in any way by Alpine.&amp;#160; It should be hopefully clear that there is no such thing as a “glibc based alpine image” because Alpine does not use glibc, it uses musl.</description>

      <description>It’s long been known that Google pays Apple a hefty sum every year to ensure that it remains the default search engine on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Now, a new report from analysts at Bernstein suggests that the payment from Google to Apple may reach $15 billion in 2021, up from $10 billion in 2020. […]</description>

      <title>Cleaner, more elegant, and harder to recognize</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050114-00/?p=36693</link>
      <description>It appears that some people interpreted the title of one of my rants from many months ago, “Cleaner, more elegant, and wrong”, to be a reference to exceptions in general. (See bibliography reference [35]; observe that the citer even changed the title of my article for me!)  The title of the article was a reference to a specific code snippet that I copied from a book,</description>

      <description>Just because you can’t see the error path doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.  Here’s a snippet from a book on C# programming, taken from the chapter on how great exceptions are.  try {  AccessDatabase accessDb = new AccessDatabase();  accessDb.GenerateDatabase(); } catch (Exception e) {  // Inspect caught exception } public void GenerateDatabase() {  CreatePhysicalDatabase();</description>

      <title>In C#, how do I get the descriptive text for an HRESULT?</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210826-00/?p=105609</link>
      <description>Suppose your C# code manages to find in its hands a COM HRESULT value. How do you convert that to a descriptive string? One idea is to p/invoke to the Format&amp;#173;Message function, but that’s awfully cumbersome. Maybe we can live off the land.</description>

      <description>Using async Rust libraries is usually easy. It&amp;#39;s just like using normal Rust code, with a little async or .await here and there. But writing your own async libraries can be hard.</description>
