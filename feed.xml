      <description>Alan Turing may best be remembered as one of the leading code breakers of Bletchley Park during World War II. It was Turing's brilliant insights and mathematical mind that helped to break Enigma, the apparently unbreakable code used by the German military.</description>

      <title>Making Your Code Faster by Taming Branches </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/articles/making-code-faster-taming-branches/</link>
      <description>Most software code contains conditional branches. In code, they appear in if-then-else clauses, loops, and switch-case constructs.  For better performance, modern processors predict the branch and execute the following instructions speculatively. It is a powerful optimization.</description>

      <title>This is How Science Happens • Hillel Wayne</title>
      <link>https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/this-is-how-science-happens/</link>
      <description>I love science. Not the “space is beautiful” faux-science, but the process of doing science. Hours spent calibrating equipment, cross-checking cites of cites of cites, tedious arguments about p-values and prediction intervals, all the stuff that makes science Go. And, when it does happen, the drama. I also want us to use more empirical science in software. That’s why I wrote a talk on it!
One thing lay folk don’t realize is that science is social.</description>

      <description>I've been writing about cryptography for a book for a year now, and it has brought me some interesting challenges.
One of them is that I constantly have to throw away what I've learned a long time ago, and imagine what it feels like not to know about a concept.
For example what are key exchanges? 
The most intuitive explanation that I knew of (up until recently) was the one given by the wikipedia ...</description>

      <link>https://www.josephguadagno.net/2020/03/10/using-git-tag-for-presentations-or-workshops</link>
      <description>While we hope it never happens, demo failures happen when presenting talks or doing workshops. I do not know of a speaker that has not had a demo go bad while up on stage or live streams. Many of us have a back up plan… After searching around for solutions for this, I decided to use git tagging to solve this for me.</description>

      <title>Hack Your Career - Troy Hunt</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d7_4JXWtFY</link>
      <description>Originally, I was content in my job, happy even. But over time I grew to want more; more job satisfaction, more opportunities, more progression. I started working on making this possible at every opportunity; while I was in the office, nights, weekends, holidays – “hacking my career” to get more out of it whenever I had the chance. Eventually, I grew tired of my windowless office. I became frustrated with car spaces being assigned based on years of service. I didn’t like that in order for my career to “progress”, I had to give up doing what I loved. I hated my salary being determined by an Excel spreadsheet that was indexed against industry norms. I didn’t want to be an industry norm! So I changed it all, entirely independently and against most conventional wisdoms.

In this talk, I’ll take you through my journey from a normal everyday corporate software job to complete independence. I’ll share the things I did that made me happier and more productive whilst I was there, but also what I did to ultimately give me the choices in life to focus on the things I love doing in a post-corporate world. You’ll see what worked well, what failed, the abuse I got along the way and ultimately, what the spoils of success look like today.

This talk is for everyone who wants to get more out of their technology career whether that be in their existing role or somewhere new in the future. It will inspire, motivate and guide you on how to get started on hacking your own career.
