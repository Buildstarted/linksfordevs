      <description>There are different kind of performance indicators for disks. The most commonly known is probably throughput. When you use a USB stick you will immediately notice if it’s USB 2.0 or 3.x in case of a GiB sized data transfer. Another important performance indicator for storage is IOPS. IOPS is the number of I/O operations that the disk can handle per second. For example, a typical 7200U SATA HDD has about 75 IOPS, while a Samsung SSD 850 PRO has about 100k IOPS[1]. You’ve probably noticed a significant performance boost after replacing your HDD with a SSD for your operating system.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Cheap Recording Setup for Online Lecturing</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2021/recording_setup/</link>
      <description>The pandemic changed the way many of us work, making remote work often
a necessity.1 As a ‘glass-half-full person’ and an early-career
researcher,2 I understood that I would now have more opportunities to
disseminate my research to a larger audience. This required levelling up
my game when it came to producing video content, and I want to use this
post to provide some more details about my current setup.</description>

      <title>What It Means to Learn to Code</title>
      <link>http://writing.andrewritchie.info/tech/coding/2021/03/15/what-it-means-to-learn-to-code.html?foo=bar</link>
      <description>After a career change I have been working as a professional software developer for over ten years now, despite the fact I didn&amp;#39;t study computer science or software engineering in university. In those ten years I&amp;#39;ve worked on projects for tiny startups that never made it, and big companies you&amp;#39;ve definitely heard of like the New York Times and Axel Springer. Occasionally friends approach me for advice and perspective about how they can learn to code as a career change or just as a hobby. One of the big problems is defining what &amp;quot;knowing how to code&amp;quot; means. It&amp;#39;s very easy to pick up a coding tutorial or two and after finishing still feel near clueless and unsure of what to do next. Some very boasty (and unrealistic) books &amp;amp; tutorials claim to be able to teach you to code in twenty four hours or a weekend, some less optimistic experts suggest it could take ten years. I have an alternate theory.</description>

      <title>How Many Decimals of Pi Do We Really Need? - Edu News | NASA/JPL Edu</title>

      <description>Earlier this week, we received this question from a fan on Facebook who wondered how many decimals of the mathematical constant pi (π) NASA-JPL scientists and engineers use when making calculations:Does JPL only use 3.14 for its pi calculations? Or do you use more decimals like say: 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286208998628034825342117067982148086513282306647093844609550582231725359408128481117450284102701938521105559644622948954930381964428810975665933446128475648233786783165271201909145648566923460348610454326648213393607260249141273724587006606315588174881520920962829254091715364367892590360We posed this question to the director and chief engineer for NASA&amp;#39;s Dawn mission, Marc Rayman.

      <description>Our next stop in showing off our library for building awaitable synchronization objects is the auto-reset event. The auto-reset event is trickier because claiming a token also mutates the object’s state. Many of our synchronization objects are of this ilk, so let’s add a helper method to our template:   template&amp;lt;typename State&amp;gt;</description>
