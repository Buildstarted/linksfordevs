      <title>How World of Warcraft Private Servers Work Total Breakdown</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/0sX-hH9NAeM</link>
      <description>To learn for free on Brilliant, go to https://brilliant.org/Tariq10x/ . You’ll also get 20% off an annual premium subscription.

Ever wondered how World of Warcraft private servers actually work behind the scenes? In this video, I dive deep into the C++ source code of AzerothCore, explaining the architecture, networking, and gameplay logic that makes these servers possible.

We’ll walk through how the server handles client connections, authentication, packet parsing, and game world simulation. I’ll also highlight some of the clever software engineering tricks and reverse engineering techniques used by developers to recreate the server side.

Whether you’re interested in game development, MMORPG server emulation, or just curious about the C++ code that powers private servers, this breakdown will give you an inside look at the technical details and architecture that make it all work.
If you enjoy this kind of code review and game architecture analysis, check out my other videos on Doom, Quake, Diablo, and more classic game engines!

      <title>Tokenizing search engine queries for diverse results</title>
      <link>https://studium.dev/tech/simple-serp-strategy</link>
      <description>Here’s a simple and neat approach to using search engines I came up with today: Find a tokenizer to use for your search query. In this case our query is online tokenizer Add spaces between the tokens from the tokenizer output for your new query: online tokenizer → online token izer Potentially pull up new and previously unseen search results online tokenizer DuckDuckGo Original query results: Tokenized query results: Some of the result differences: I intend to study this more in depth eventually, if you want you can find my progress here: github.</description>

      <title>Nobody Gets Fired For Reporting the Error to Sentry</title>
      <link>https://apimason.com/blog/nobody-gets-fired-for-reporting-the-error-to-sentry</link>
      <description>Error tracking services were a gift to the development world decades ago, but their effectiveness today is similar to uptime trackers that confirm your app's webpage is up. Modern applications are complex API ecosystems where customer jobs fall through cracks despite excellent system health metrics.</description>

      <title>The Silk Road vs. Sapiens: Why Popular History Shouldn't Mean False History</title>
      <link>https://kaifiyat.blog/posts/thesilkroadsvssapiens/</link>
      <description>Christopher Columbus set sail in 1492, “certain though he was of finding the Great Khan – and of the role he would play in the liberation of Jerusalem.” Not to spread enlightenment, as Yuval Noah Harari would have us believe in Sapiens, but on a religious mission to defeat Muslims and claim wealth for Christian Europe.
This single quote from Peter Frankopan’s The Silk Road captures exactly what frustrated me so deeply about Sapiens. Where Harari spins a neat story about European exploration driven by academic curiosity and enlightenment values, Frankopan provides the messy, complicated, properly researched truth: Columbus was a religious zealot seeking the Great Khan to fight a holy war.
