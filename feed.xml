      <title>The #1 Pattern You Need To Know When Publishing Events</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=6YwSKMvTgDU</link>
      <description>Hi, I'm James Eastham and it this video I dive into the intricacies of the outbox pattern. Event-driven architectures can seem straightforward, but managing state and publishing events requires careful consideration.

You'll learn about two key methods: the traditional approach involving transactional writes to separate tables, and the modern approach utilizing Amazon DynamoDB streams. I share hands-on code examples and highlight common pitfalls, offering a thorough guide to building resilient event-driven systems. By the end of this video, you'll understand how to ensure reliable state management while publishing events effectively.

      <title>Korea TSPs</title>
      <link>https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/korea/index.html</link>
      <description>We have solved a traveling salesman problem (TSP) to walk to 81,998 bars in South Korea.
The problem was created using the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) to build a table of the 3,361,795,003 point-to-point travel times, one for each pair of bar locations.
Our computation produced a tour together with a proof that it is a shortest-possible route to visit all 81,998 stops when measured with the OSRM times.</description>

      <link>https://fedi.rib.gay/notes/a6xqityngfubsz0f</link>
      <description>Today Melissa Lewis over on BlueSky pointed out that the font used in the infamous "You wouldn't steal a car" anti-piracy campaign was actually designed by Just van Rossum, whose brother, Guido, created the Python programming language (https://bsky.app/profile/melissa.news/post/3ln7hx5rhcj2v)

She also pointed out that the font had been cloned and released illegally for free under the name "XBAND Rough". Naturally, it would be hilarious if the anti-piracy campaign actually turned out to have used this pirated font, so I went sleuthing and quickly found a PDF from the campaign site with the font embedded (https://web.archive.org/web/20051223202935/http://www.piracyisacrime.com:80/press/pdfs/150605_8PP_brochure.pdf).

So I chucked it into FontForge and yep, turns out the campaign used a pirated font the entire time! üìé</description>
