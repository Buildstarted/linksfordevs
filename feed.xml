      <title>Tip 274 - Set Your AzContext Interactively</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip274.html</link>
      <description>If you are working with Azure, the probability of you having multiple accounts and subscriptions to work with are very high. If I look at myself, I have a personal account, a business account and my workaccount that I often use everyday. Deploying scripts through Powershell requires you to make sure you are in the right context. Especially with the rise of Azure Lighthouse, where you maybe have access to a lot of subscriptions through one account, a simple mistake is easily made.</description>

      <title>Check out this workshop @AzureAIConf - Advanced .NET, Containers and Azure</title>
      <link>https://virtual.devintersection.com/#!/workshop/Advanced%20.NET,%20Containers%20and%20Azure/4591</link>
      <description>This workshop will walk .NET customers through all the options for hosting their code in Azure using Windows, Linux and Containers. You will learn how to develop locally on Windows and Linux and containers and then publish and diagnose your applications in Azure. Next we will take a deep dive into building API’s and gPRC services in .NET that can be called from all platforms. Including developing API’s that can be tested on the local development box with the application running in Azure. And finally we will dive into some of the new capabilities in .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5 to make your web services into single file executables that are both small and easy to host. Each section will cover a topic and then have exercises you can go through on your own computer.  When your done you should understand how to build API’s and services, host them in the variety of options that Azure provides and build small and performant API’s.</description>

      <title>It is perfectly OK to only code at work, you can have a life too.</title>
      <link>https://zeroequalsfalse.com/posts/it-is-ok-to-only-code-at-work/</link>
      <description>There is often pressure inside Software development for Software developers to code outside of work hours. Whether you are a Python, Ruby, Java, or any other developer... There is absolutely no need to code outside of work if you don't want too. Coding is considered a passion for some, but others they don't think this way. They are more than happy to not read a line of code in their spare time.</description>

      <title>The kernel and BitKeeper part ways</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/130746/</link>
      <description>Back in early 1999, your editor got a call from Larry McVoy.  He was
worried that Linus Torvalds was on the verge of burning out as the kernel
project grew.  The problems in those days were quite evident; Linus, it was
being said, did not scale.  But, according to Larry,
a complete burnout was not inevitable.  If Linus could be given the right
tools, many of his problems (and the frustrations of other kernel
developers) could be solved, and the system would run smoothly again.  The
right tool, according to Larry, was a thing called BitKeeper; if some sort
of agreement could be made on licensing, Larry (along with his company, BitMover)
was willing to make 
BitKeeper available for kernel development.  In fact, Larry wanted to see
BitKeeper used for all free software development; see this article from the 
March 25, 1999 LWN Weekly Edition for a view of how things looked at
that time.</description>

      <description>As a developer, it's nice to be able to create things to make your life easier. I was tired of having to open up my videos just to copy the link and share it. So, I created my first Chrome Extension! It shows me a list of my most recent videos and allows me to copy the link directly!

      <title>Workshop: Hack Yourself First: How to go on the Cyber-Offence - Day 1/2 - NDC TechTown 2020</title>
      <link>https://ndctechtown.com/talk/workshop-hack-yourself-first-how-to-go-on-the-cyber-offence-day-1-2/</link>
      <description>Day 1/2
&lt;br&gt;
Cyber-attacks have become a reality of running software on the web today. We find ourselves under a constant barrage of malicious activity from hacktivists, online criminals and increasingly, nation states. Successful attacks from these adversaries are predominantly via flaws in the software products they target – flaws that could have been prevented by developers understanding how online attackers work and what the appropriate defensive measures are.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>PDF: Still Unfit for Human Consumption, 20 Years Later</title>

      <description>Research spanning 20 years proves PDFs are problematic for online reading. Yet they’re still prevalent and users continue to get lost in them. They’re unpleasant to read and navigate and remain unfit for digital-content display.</description>
