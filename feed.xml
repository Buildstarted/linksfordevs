      <title>Welcome to Kubernetes API Server Adventures</title>
      <link>https://danielmangum.com/posts/k8s-asa-welcome/</link>
      <description>Kubernetes is comprised of a variety of components, yet most end-user interaction with the system flows through the API Server. It is the entrypoint to many of the features that the project has built up over its lifetime, and can be extended to support arbitrary additional functionality. Because of this, the API Server has proved to be a bottleneck in some cases that it was not originally designed to accommodate, or at least accommodate well.</description>

      <link>https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/sql-server/learn/manage-data-over-time-with-sql-server-merge-statement/</link>
      <description>Once data is in a table it needs to be maintained. New records will need to be added, and existing records will need to be updated, and/or deleted. To keep data maintained, the insert, update or delete actions may need to be performed. This article will show how those three data manipulation language (DML) actions can be synchronized together within a single basic MERGE statement.</description>
