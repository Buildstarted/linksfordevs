      <link>http://testerstories.com/2020/10/the-basis-of-testing/</link>
      <description>Epistemology is about the way we know things. Ontology is about what things fundamentally are. Ontogeny is about the history of changes that preserve the integrity of something. What does this have to do with testing? Everything. But let’s talk about it.</description>

      <title>Installing a Server Rack in my Home Office and adding a Ubiquiti Dream Machine/Switches for Dual WAN</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afRV3qYuSfg</link>
      <description>This is the story of how I upgraded from an Amplifi, to a Ubiquiti Dream Machine, then finally moving to the UDM Pro line of equipment. A home rack is actually simpler and easier than I&amp;#39;d expected and I&amp;#39;m pretty proud of myself for pulling it off.

One thing I did fail to mention, there IS a wall mounted APC UPS for the whole rack.

Timeline:

      <title>Daniel Skogly&amp;#39;s blog | You might not need to store (plaintext) emails</title>
      <link>https://blog.klungo.no/2020/11/01/you-might-not-need-to-store-plaintext-emails/</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Earlier this year, when I went from having only Facebook-login on &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://wishy.gift&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Wishy.gift&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to allow registrations with email and password, one of my concerns was how to implement this is a way that protects the data and privacy of my users. I don’t have any ads or analytics on the site, the users can select whatever display name they want, and I never stored the email I got from Facebook when a user registered or logged in - only a hashed&amp;lt;sup class=&amp;quot;footnote-ref&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;#fn1&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;fnref1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[1]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; version of the ID. Emails and passwords, on the other hand, are a whole other beast, and the consequences of a database breach much worse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Here is a way to predict who is going to win the election.</title>
      <link>https://blog.taylorsteinberg.com/2020/11/01/here-is-a-way-to-predict-who-is-going-to-win-the-election.html</link>
      <description>Take the winners of each of the past two elections, which may be one or two presidents. Place them on the circumference of a circle with a distance along the rim between them so that space represents the Overton Window’s size. The radius of the ring is representative of the size of the Overton Window. To pick the candidate that is most likely to win the next election, take the point opposite the original two so that when lines are drawn between them, they form an equilateral triangle. Then draw a line between the center of the circle and the third point so that the line intersects with the opposing side of the triangle at a perpendicular.</description>

      <link>https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/</link>
      <description>The tasks were selected by the following criteria. The task set should be as small as possible yet reflect as many typical (or fundamental or representative) challenges in GUI programming as possible. Each task should be as simple and self-contained as possible yet not too artificial. Preferably, a task should be based on existing examples as that gives the task more justification to be useful and there already will be at least one reference implementation.</description>

      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/507/the-missing-explanation-of-zk-snarks/</link>
      <description>What are ZK-SNARKs and how do they work? This is a question I’ve had for years, and always felt like the resources I found gave no clear intuition as to how all of that stuff worked. So today, after a breakthrough in my own understanding, I thought it would be good to re-share what I’ve learned in a more understandable picture. Something that tells you what is the right way of thinking about these ...</description>
