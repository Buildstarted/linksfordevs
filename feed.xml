      <link>https://www.alexanderhupfer.com/working-with-json-data-in-mysql/</link>
      <description>JSON is undeniably king of portable data formats and almost all APIs will return it in some form. But on the database side things are less clear cut, as according to DB-Engines noSQL databases don’t rank in top 4. This … Read More</description>

      <link>https://anupam.de/projects/descriptify/articles/articles/BiggestMistakeasRPADeveloper.html</link>
      <description>I was an RPA developer for 4 years - from 2017 to 2021. In late 2019, I made one crucial decision
        that led to my being chosen as one of
        
          UiPath&amp;#39;s 62 MVPs for the year 2021. This decision was to stop keeping up with the latest
          RPA trends and focus instead on mastering traditional software development.</description>

      <title>Detecting pitch with the Web Audio API and autocorrelation &amp;#183; Caffeinspiration</title>
      <link>https://alexanderell.is/posts/tuner/</link>
      <description>I’ve been playing with the Web Audio API recently, and I made a basic app that will detect the pitch of incoming tones using your microphone. You can try it by pressing “Start” (be sure to try both the sine wave and the frequency displays), and I’ll be walking through how it works below.</description>

      <title>Searching for outliers</title>
      <link>https://www.benkuhn.net/outliers/</link>
      <description>Shortly after I started blogging, because I was a college student and had nothing better to do, I set a goal to write every week. I started in September 2013 and wrote around 150 posts between then and when I started working at Wave. (At that point I stopped having nothing better to do, so my blogging frequency tanked.)
The outcomes of these 150 posts were extremely skewed:
 Two made it big on the Hacker News frontpage (What happened to all the non-programmers and Readability, hackability, and abstraction).</description>

      <title>Hard to work with.</title>
      <link>https://lethain.com/hard-to-work-with/</link>
      <description>Managing teams has taught me a lot about my own behaviors and motivations. For example, I overworked for a long time. This left me continually teetering on the brink of burnout, and I had no energy left to absorb the typical sorts of organizational changes that happen at any company. Despite doing good work, I handled change poorly, and I picked up the reputation for being difficult to manage.
I’d like to say that I learned from my mistakes directly, but the honest version is that I came to understand this dynamic mostly through working with folks struggling from the same issue.</description>
