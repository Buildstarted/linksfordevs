      <title>A .NET Color Console Helper</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Jul/10/A-NET-Console-Color-Helper?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20RickStrahl%20(Rick%20Strahl%27s%20WebLog)</link>
      <description>In this short post I'll discuss a small Console helper class I've been using to make it easier and more consistent to use colors with the .NET Console command. The .NET Console support colors easily enough, but switching colors and resetting them can be a bit tedious, so these helpers make working with color a bit easier.</description>

      <description>A short tutorial post on multiple screens for laptops with touch-support and ArchLinux. Also evolved into a long rant, with an Easter egg.
 Background Of late, I have been attempting to move away from paper, for environmental reasons1. Years of touch typing in Colemak (rationale, config changes) and a very customized Emacs setup (including mathematica, temporary latex templates, Nix, and org-roam annotations) have more or less kept me away from analog devices.</description>

      <description>At some point, I got tired of my old static site generator setup for my blogs and other pages. It was annoying to ssh every time I wanted to make a modification, it was annoying to sftp or sshfs all my images, and so forth. And god forbid, if you ever wanted someone else to write something or make an edit, let me tell you, most people are not particularly happy when you tell him "hey, I'll make you a user on my server, give me your public key so you can ssh in".</description>

      <title>ongoing by Tim Bray · Just Too Efficient</title>
      <link>https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/07/05/Too-Efficient</link>
      <description>On a Spring 2019
    walk in Beijing I saw two street sweepers
    at a sunny corner. They were beat-up looking and grizzled but probably younger than me. They’d paused
    work to smoke and talk. One told a story; the other’s eyes widened and then he laughed so hard he had to
    bend over, leaning on his broom.  I suspect their jobs and pay were lousy and their lives constrained in ways I can’t
    imagine. But they had time to smoke a cigarette and crack a joke. You know what that’s called? Waste,
    inefficiency, a suboptimal outcome. Some of the brightest minds in our economy are earnestly engaged in stamping it
    out. They’re winning, but everyone’s losing.</description>

      <description>In January I wrote a post about setting up VS2019 and VSCode to use the .editorconfig. In this post I'm going to write about how to get the .editorconfig settings checked during build time.</description>
