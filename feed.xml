      <title>Frontend development is pain in 2020. But it gets better</title>
      <link>https://pixeljets.com/blog/frontend-dev-gets-better/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve just started building a &amp;#160;dashboard for my new project, which is an
opionated Node.js API gateway (still in its infancy), with Clickhouse for
logging: https://github.com/restyler/api-gateway. 

Here is what I&amp;#39;m telling you: in case you forgot, frontend world is full of
bloat. Transpilers, bundlers, and compilers, paired with watchers, which
recompile your project on save, and try to make hot reload work in browser, make
the life of an average JS developer full of &amp;#160;pain and misery.

      <title>Julia Helps To Bridge The Gap Between User and Creator</title>
      <link>https://jkrumbiegel.github.io/pages/2020-10-23-julia-bridge/</link>
      <description>You might have heard about Julia, the language often praised for the C-like performance it can attain while keeping a clean syntax reminiscent of Python. In this blog post, I want to share a different opinion why I like using Julia, which is only tangentially related to its pure performance. It is about the community Julia enables and how that could have a beneficial influence on the way scientific software is written.</description>

      <title>Strict Transport Security vs. HTTPS Resource Records: the showdown</title>
      <link>https://emilymstark.com/2020/10/24/strict-transport-security-vs-https-resource-records-the-showdown.html</link>
      <description>HTTPS resource records (HTTPS RRs) are a new type of DNS record. The standard is still in progress and covers various intended use cases, mostly around delivering configuration information and parameters for how to access a service. In this post, I’m going to ignore all that and focus on one very simple use case: an HTTPS RR, on its own, can signal that a domain supports HTTPS, allowing the browser to upgrade connections to that domain from http:// to https://. In theory, browsers could look up HTTPS RRs alongside the A/AAAA lookup for a hostname, and if an HTTPS RR is present, then the browser would send the request over https:// and not http://. The idea is to prevent sslstrip-style attacks where a request to a site over http:// gets rewritten by the attacker, before the server even has a chance to redirect the http:// request to https://.</description>
