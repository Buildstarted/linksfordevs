      <title>Building a website without becoming a ‘soydev’</title>
      <link>https://worldofmatthew.com/post/soydev/</link>
      <description>You will always hear of large media companies crying about how piracy is killing their industry, even if the evidence for these claims are uncertain with some studies claiming small positive, small negative or near-no affect to sales of media, depending on the type of that media.</description>

      <title>Why I Had to Migrate from MongoDB to PostgreSQL</title>
      <link>https://jerseyfonseca.com/blogs/mongodb-to-postgresql-migration</link>
      <description>A few months ago, I made WeWatch,
            a mobile app to help you find what films to watch.
            I made the decision to use MongoDB because of the popularity
            of the MERN stack.</description>

      <title>From Node to Ruby on Rails - D U N K</title>
      <link>https://nikodunk.com/a-node-js-developer-discovers-rails/</link>
      <description>I learned to code in the Javascript stack [1] and am building a Javascript based product [2]. I never questioned this stack: many companies default to it, JS everywhere seems good, and the community is big. But for my new side project I decided to try Rails because despite some perception that Ruby on Rails is ‘over’, people in HN comments say it was somehow more enjoyable than the newer Node based stack.</description>

      <title>Surgical Refactors</title>
      <link>https://camhashemi.com/posts/surgical-refactors/</link>
      <description>Refactoring is like surgery.
That’s not to say that clean refactors save lives. But messy refactors definitely hurt.
A surgeon is economical with their cuts, and refactoring requires the same mindset.
 A naive surgeon takes a quick look at their patient and starts slicing away. They start with a big gash through the patient. They seek to cover as much ground as possible, as quickly as possible. They’re confident that they can close the gap once their work is done.</description>

      <title>Behind the scenes, AWS Lambda</title>
      <link>https://www.bschaatsbergen.com/behind-the-scenes-lambda</link>
      <description>Writing code and deploying it to AWS Lambda is as easy as baking a cake (depending on the type of cake).
            Lambda performs the heavy lifting for you, from provisioning to scaling.
            But where is the magic happening and how does it actually work under the hood? Lets find out together!</description>

      <title>25 Gigabit Linux internet router PC build</title>
      <link>https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-07-10-linux-25gbit-internet-router-pc-build/</link>
      <description>init7 recently announced that with their FTTH fiber offering Fiber7, they will now sell and connect you with 25 Gbit/s (Fiber7-X2) or 10 Gbit/s (Fiber7-X) fiber optics, if you want more than 1 Gbit/s.
While this offer will only become available at my location late this year (or possibly later due to the supply chain shortage), I already wanted to get the hardware on my end sorted out.</description>

      <title>Programmers, Teach Non-Geeks The True Cost of Interruptions</title>
      <link>https://daedtech.com/programmers-teach-non-geeks-the-true-cost-of-interruptions/</link>
      <description>Interruptions are one of the biggest sources of inefficiency for programmers. Now, to be fair, they’re probably a big source of inefficiency for everyone, but relatively speaking, they’re worse for programmers. To understand what I mean, let’s take someone whose job is in sales. A lot of the day is probably spent on the phone […]</description>
