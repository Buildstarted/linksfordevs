      <link>https://mariusgundersen.net/dynamic-endpoint-routing/</link>
      <description>I want to share a bit about how the endpoint routing in asp.net can be made dynamic. I tried to look into this, but couldn&amp;#39;t find any documentation and so decided that I had to write about it myself. I will use asp.net 6 in this article since I can then use the minimal apis and more easily fit everything into a single file, but the code shown here will work in asp.net 5 and will work with the classical Startup class too.</description>

      <title>How &amp;quot;See A Satellite Tonight&amp;quot; Works | James Darpinian</title>
      <link>https://james.darpinian.com/blog/how-see-a-satellite-tonight-works</link>
      <description>See A Satellite Tonight is my most successful side project so far, with 5 million users since launch in 2019. It&amp;#39;s been entirely a solo project, and I&amp;#39;ve used it as a proving ground for a bunch of tech that I wanted to learn. It took dozens of APIs and services to put together the experience I wanted: The front page of See A Satellite Tonight</description>

      <title>I’m tired of making decisions</title>
      <link>https://artemis.sh/2022/07/15/decision-making-is-finite.html</link>
      <description>Decisions are our keys to the ethereal freedom, but they are also our shackles to the earth. I’ve been thinking a lot about what makes a system pleasant for me to use, particularly as a workstation. I’ve become disillusioned with a lot of Linux distributions as of late, not for technical reasons, but just because many of them feel cause me to feel depressed and dejected when I work with them. One of the primary factors I’ve identified is how they reckon with choice. What do they allow me to choose? What do they force me to choose? This balance is why I use Puppy Linux, despite everything, and why I’ve gone from being an Arch Linux zealot to avoiding it at all costs.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Ads</title>
      <link>http://peterhajas.com/blog/avoiding_ads.html</link>
      <description>I hate ads. I don&amp;#39;t like watching them, I don&amp;#39;t like seeing them, and I don&amp;#39;t like hearing them. The attention economy is very sad and I want no part of it. &amp;quot;Ethical ads&amp;quot; are about as oxymoronic as &amp;quot;healthy cigarettes&amp;quot;. A friend recently told me that advertising reduces activity in the decision-making parts of your brain.</description>
