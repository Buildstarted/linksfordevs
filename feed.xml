      <description>Our productivity is limited by our resources, but we have the ability to make better or worse use of them. The goal should be to use each of our resources as close to its limit as possible. We want to use every bit of our CPU and memory or else we&amp;#39;re over-paying for expensive machines.</description>

      <description>This is part one of the Crossover Project. Part two is here and part three is here.
I sat in front of Mat, idly chatting about tech and cuisine. Before now, I had known him mostly for his cooking pictures on Twitter, the kind that made me envious of suburbanites and their 75,000 BTU woks. But now he was the test subject for my new project, to see if it was going to be fruitful or a waste of time.</description>

      <title>Obsidian is (almost) a Typora killer</title>
      <link>https://benjamindlee.com/posts/2022/obsidian-is-almost-a-typora-killer/</link>
      <description>For the last several years, I used Typora for my academic writing flow. It has all of the benefits of a WYSIWYG editor combined with all the advantages of the Markdown ecosystem such as Pandoc for format conversion and Git for version control. I thought I had found my ideal setup—I even drafted a post on it—until last month.
Recently, Typora left beta and started charging for the application itself. This alone would not be enough for me to abandon it or even alter my review.</description>

      <description>I had always wanted to learn how to reverse engineer Android apps. There were people out there who knew how to navigate and modify the internals of an APK file and I wasn’t one of them. This had to be changed but it took a long time for that to happen. In this post, I will show you how I was able to reverse engineer an Android app, add some debug statements, and figure out how certain query parameters for API calls were being generated.</description>

      <description>Many applications introduce some kind of status to make it easier to share data. However, more and more modules in your codebase need to be explicit about these assumptions. Views can eliminate the problematic SQL query. It’s also great way to introduce well-defined entities.</description>

      <title>CSRF: How to exploit and how to defend</title>
      <link>https://kerkour.com/csrf/</link>
      <description>The past few weeks I implemented an API that relies on Cookies for authentication. When working with Cookies you should always be extremely careful not to introduce CSRF vulnerabilities.
Usually, I build APIs using a specific Authentication HTTP header which completely removes the risk of CSRF (more on that below). So, why should you be careful when building Websites and APIs which rely on Cookies for authentication? How to attack CSRF vulnerabilities?</description>

      <title>Zef: Low-latency, Scalable, Private Payments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05671</link>
      <description>We introduce Zef, the first Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol to
support payments in anonymous digital coins at arbitrary scale. Zef follows the
communication and security model of FastPay: both protocols are asynchronous,
low-latency, linearly-scalable, and powered by partially-trusted sharded
authorities. In contrast with FastPay, user accounts in Zef are
uniquely-identified and safely removable. Zef coins are bound to an account by
a digital certificate and otherwise stored off-chain by their owners. To create
and redeem coins, users interact with the protocol via privacy-preserving
operations: Zef uses randomized commitments and NIZK proofs to hide coin
values; and, created coins are made unlinkable using the blind and randomizable
threshold anonymous credentials of Coconut. Besides the detailed specifications
and our analysis of the protocol, we are making available an open-source
implementation of Zef in Rust. Our extensive benchmarks on AWS confirm textbook
linear scalability and demonstrate a confirmation time under one second at
nominal capacity. Compared to existing anonymous payment systems based on a
blockchain, this represents a latency speedup of three orders of magnitude,
with no theoretical limit on throughput.</description>
