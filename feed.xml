      <title>Multi-Tenancy with RavenDB and ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/3f18ed50-487f-45fa-a71f-6b0ddf3d87ec</link>
      <description>Multi-tenancy is a software architecture pattern where a single instance of a software application is used by multiple customers, with each customer having separate and isolated data, configurations, and resources. RavenDB is a NoSQL document database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for multi-tenant applications. This blog post will explore why multi-tenancy exists, the advantages of using RavenDB for multi-tenant applications, and provide code examples to get you started.

      <title>PostgreSQL in C# .NET with Npgsql, Dapper, and Entity Framework: The Complete Guide</title>
      <link>https://michaelscodingspot.com/postgres-in-csharp/</link>
      <description>One of the most used databases these days is PostgreSQL (aka Postgres). Its accomplishments include being the most popular DB [among professional developers] according to Stack Overflow survey of 2022, the database in all of the fastest TechEmpower benchmarks, and being the most advanced open source database (self-proclaimed).
We’ll talk today about combining Postgres with my favorite language and runtime: C# and .NET. Just because Postgres isn’t a first-party Microsoft database, like SQL Server, doesn’t mean you don’t have full support for it in C#.</description>

      <title>A Button Only Date Picker and JavaScript Date Control Binding</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2023/Feb/06/A-Button-Only-Date-Picker-and-JavaScript-Date-Control-Binding</link>
      <description>The native date picker in HTML is a bit of a pain to work with as it&amp;#39;s overly simplistic in features and how you have to assign and retrieve values from it. It also isn&amp;#39;t customizable so if you need to build custom behavior like a button date popup that doesn&amp;#39;t show the input control, you&amp;#39;re out of luck. In this post I discuss the challenges of the HTML date picker control, provide small component to make binding values easier, and provide an example on how to create a button only date picker both with plain JavaScript and as a small Vue component.</description>
