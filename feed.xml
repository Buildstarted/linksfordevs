      <description>The U.K. Parliament has passed the Online Safety Bill (OSB), which says it will make the U.K. “the safest place” in the world to be online. In reality, the OSB will lead to a much more censored, locked-down internet for British users. The bill could empower the government to undermine not just the privacy and security of U.K. residents, but internet users worldwide.</description>

      <title>.NET Rocks! Data Science and UX with Grishma Jena</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1864</link>
      <description>Data Science and UX should be the best of friends! While at the Copenhagen Developer Festival, Carl and Richard talked to Grishma Jena about her work in data science at IBM - and working closely with the UX teams to understand how customers use software and the opportunities to improve it. Grishma talks about the quantitative side of analytics regarding application telemetry, including the ability to predict when a customer is about to abandon an application. The conversation also digs into using modern machine learning to analyze quantitative data, such as comments in surveys - could you sort that kind of data by sentiment or actionability? Improve your UX with data!</description>

      <title>64-Bit Bank Balances ‘Ought to be Enough for Anybody’? | TigerBeetle</title>
      <link>https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2023-09-19-64-bit-bank-balances-ought-to-be-enough-for-anybody/</link>
      <description>Recently at TigerBeetle,
              we’ve decided
              to use 128-bit integers to store all financial amounts and
              balances, retiring our previous use of 64-bit integers. While some
              may argue that a 64-bit integer, which can store integers ranging
              from zero to 264, is enough to count the
              grains of sand on Earth, we realized we need to go beyond this limit if we want to be
              able to store all kinds of transactions adequately. Let’s
              find out why.</description>

      <link>https://prakgupta.com/blog/real_world_stats_for_bootstrapping</link>
      <description>There is a lot of advice about bootstrapping startups on twitter. Unfortunately, their is no way to verify what is true and what is marketing. 
        So I decided to crunch some numbers and make a few hard assertions.</description>

      <description>Still think that the DoD 7-pass random data erase is the gold standard? That might have made sense years ago, back when there were wide guard bands between tracks on disks and tolerances were sloppy. Here in the future, though, the tracks sometimes even overlap (ever hear of SMR?) and …</description>

      <description>I finished reading Walter Isaacson’s Elon Musk biography this past week. It’s awesome! Definitely one of my favorite biographies and a book I’ll return to many times.

      <title>Inside New Query Engine of MongoDB</title>
      <link>https://laplab.me/posts/inside-new-query-engine-of-mongodb/</link>
      <description>MongoDB has recently released a new query engine coming in version 7.0. I was one of the people working on this engine during my 2 years in MongoDB and I would like to share some technical details about it.
Disclaimer: Prior to writing this article, I have contacted my ex-colleagues at MongoDB to ensure that it does not conflict with their plans. They gave me the green light, provided I send them the draft before publishing, which I did.</description>

      <description>I (and many others) have done a lot of complaining about the modern web. I’ve made videos in the past talking about how I miss the old, independent web when everyone had their own website and there was always a cool, new, unique website that you could find and explore.</description>
