      <title>Programmers and Their Monospace Blogs</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2025-06-24_reading_blogs/</link>
      <description>Many developers seem to have a fanatic obsession with monospace fonts and using them to make their blogs look “cool”. I won’t call out anyone’s blog specifically, but you don’t have to look to hard to find some. As an example theme using a monospace font by default, look at hugo-theme-terminal, which has over 2,400 stars on GitHub. If you have a blog or are thinking about starting one, and you are writing mostly prose (you probably are), I have one suggestion for you about fonts:
Do not use monospace fonts for prose.</description>

      <title>The Engineering Triangle: A Framework I've Been Thinking About</title>
      <link>https://blog.shah256.dev/posts/engineering-triangle/</link>
      <description>So I’ve been thinking about tech careers lately, and I think there might be a better way to understand what’s going on. Most advice I see is like “find your passion” or “play to your strengths” but that doesn’t really help when you’re trying to figure out where to go next. What I’ve noticed instead is that the industry has kind of organized itself around three different ways of optimizing, and understanding this might be more useful.</description>

      <title>Agency is Your Secret Edge</title>
      <link>https://alanwu.xyz/posts/agency/</link>
      <description>Agency, as a personality trait, refers to an individual’s capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their actions and environment. It’s about being proactive rather than reactive—someone with high agency doesn’t just let life happen to them; they shape it. Think of it as a blend of self-efficacy, determination, and a sense of ownership over one’s path.</description>

      <title>How To Care About Your Job When It Doesn't Care About You</title>
      <link>https://matthogg.fyi/how-to-care-about-your-job-when-it-doesnt-care-about-you/</link>
      <description>We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that's inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us?</description>

      <title>What Problem Does UBI Solve?</title>
      <link>https://www.greshm.org/blog/what-problem-does-ubi-solve/</link>
      <description>
Ask ten different people what problem Universal Basic Income solves, and you’ll get ten different answers. Scott Santens could probably give you a hundred. This is understandable: A world with UBI differs from today’s world in innumerable ways, and it’s actually quite difficult to imagine a problem that UBI would not at least help with. It is money, after all. Money solves lots of problems.</description>

They announced it in a press release first but I grabbed the FDA submission as soon as I could. Inside, on page 28 (of 54), was a graph that I will never forget:</description>
