      <title>Pragmatic weekend project - apartments bot</title>
      <link>https://snir.dev/blog/apartments-bot/</link>
      <description>Starting and completing a weekend project, is often challenging.
        Feature creep, tech stack choices and unwaranted tech excelency (100% test coverage for a weekend project anyone?) are your enemies,
        making the project timeline go beyond one weekend, which in turn usually results in the project never being done.</description>

      <title>Efficient Note Taking</title>
      <link>https://blog.bojo.wtf/2020/06/04/efficient-note-taking/</link>
      <description>As my company starts belatedly revamping our corporate structure a lot of things have been changing, including my personal spiral towards a manager schedule vs a maker schedule lately. One thing I have noticed as I track more and more disparate things is that if I don’t start taking better notes now I’m going to fall behind and drown in forgotten caveats sooner than later. The less effective I am at tracking what I need to do (outside of task based work), or need to know across a breadth of projects, people, and responsibilities, the less effective I am going to be at supporting my team.</description>

      <description>Today I randomly stumbled upon some discussions about DirectX 12, Mantle and whatnot. It seems a lot of people somehow think that the whole idea of reducing draw call overhead was new for Mantle an…</description>

      <title>julia as a cli calculator</title>
      <link>https://krasjet.com/rnd.wlk/julia/</link>
      <description>I have been using the Julia REPL as my day-to-day calculator on the command line for more than a year now. I am surprised that I haven’t seen more posts talking about how powerful and extensible the language is for simple numerical calculations and scriptingIn fact, the Julia REPL is much more than a simple calculator, as we shall see later.</description>

      <title>Turn off your browser and try red, green &amp; refactor pattern (part 2)</title>
      <link>https://mariosfakiolas.com/blog/turn-off-your-browser-and-try-red-green-refactor-pattern-part-2/</link>
      <description>Every now and then, I come across mentally exhausted and frustrated web developers who try to test their work by clicking here and there in the UI. Most of the times something is still missing so they have to repeat this routine yet another time. My proposal is to simply turn off the browser.</description>
