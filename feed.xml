      <description>TL;DR: DevOps doesn‚Äôt have to be all work and no play. I built 5 stupid (but fun!) GitHub actions‚Ä¶ because why not?
The full code for these actions can all be found in this GitHub repo. I encourage you to fork and/or add issues/PRs with impractical actions of your own!
I also recorded a video about this project on YouTube. ‚Üê Check out the video and subscribe if you are into this sort of thing üôè

      <title>Dance training is superior to repetitive physical exercise in inducing brain plasticity in the elderly</title>
      <link>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0196636</link>
      <description>Animal research indicates that a combination of physical activity and sensory enrichment has the largest and the only sustaining effect on adult neuroplasticity. Dancing has been suggested as a human homologue to this combined intervention as it poses demands on both physical and cognitive functions. For the present exploratory study, we designed an especially challenging dance program in which our elderly participants constantly had to learn novel and increasingly difficult choreographies. This six-month-long program was compared to conventional fitness training matched for intensity. An extensive pre/post-assessment was performed on the 38 participants (63‚Äì80 y), covering general cognition, attention, memory, postural and cardio-respiratory performance, neurotrophic factors and‚Äìmost crucially‚Äìstructural MRI using an exploratory analysis. For analysis of MRI data, a new method of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) designed specifically for pairwise longitudinal group comparisons was employed. Both interventions increased physical fitness to the same extent. Pronounced differences were seen in the effects on brain volumes: Dancing compared to conventional fitness activity led to larger volume increases in more brain areas, including the cingulate cortex, insula, corpus callosum and sensorimotor cortex. Only dancing was associated with an increase in plasma BDNF levels. Regarding cognition, both groups improved in attention and spatial memory, but no significant group differences emerged. The latter finding may indicate that cognitive benefits may develop later and after structural brain changes have taken place. The present results recommend our challenging dance program as an effective measure to counteract detrimental effects of aging on the brain.</description>

      <title>How I would grow Gumroad ‚Äì Min-Kyu Jung</title>

      <description>Let‚Äôs say Sahil is right, and that the market is the biggest determinant of growth. If Gumroad's growth is restricted by the size of the indie creator market, then one way for Gumroad to ensure its future growth is to actively grow the indie creator market itself.</description>

      <description>Few things flood my brain with dopamine more than planning. My brain basks in this planning process because it feels so productive, but involves minimal mental effort.   The antidote? When I find myself gathering gear, I grab a shitty rod and start fishing.</description>

      <title>Your Brain = Your Dog?</title>
      <link>https://www.jamalx31.com/post/your-brain-your-dog</link>
      <description>You got a new dog, he‚Äôs very smart. So you decided to call him Brain. You love Brain, he‚Äôs your best friend now, and you always do things together. Everything would be perfect if Brain didn‚Äôt have this little problem; He gets distracted very easily, and when you go out for a walk, he pulls you around. No matter how tight you hold the leash, he always wins. It doesn‚Äôt stop there, and most often you find yourself following Brain rather than the other way around.</description>

      <title>Joe Bergeron | Java Obfuscation: A Pattern Language</title>
      <link>https://www.joe-bergeron.com/posts/Java%20Obfuscation:%20A%20Pattern%20Language/</link>
      <description>I recently took it upon myself to decompile and attempt to deobfuscate the relatively substantial Java codebase of a much-loved childhood MMO, a game which still manages to
attract a sizeable playerbase, despite its age. (Take a guess at what game I'm talking about!) By no means am I the first to attempt this; many third-party clients exist for
this game, some even open-source. My goal with this project wasn't to do anything new, or even to improve on the deobfuscations and client rewrites that already exist. Mostly,
I just wanted to see how it's done, if I could do it, and how, in theory, one might go about programtically integrating with the game's API. The point of this post is not about
the specifics of this game's implementation. Rather, it's about some tricky (read: evil) obfuscation techniques that I've discovered while working through the decompiled Java bytecode.</description>
