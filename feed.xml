      <title>The #1 Pattern You Need To Know When Publishing Events</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=6YwSKMvTgDU</link>
      <description>Hi, I'm James Eastham and it this video I dive into the intricacies of the outbox pattern. Event-driven architectures can seem straightforward, but managing state and publishing events requires careful consideration.

You'll learn about two key methods: the traditional approach involving transactional writes to separate tables, and the modern approach utilizing Amazon DynamoDB streams. I share hands-on code examples and highlight common pitfalls, offering a thorough guide to building resilient event-driven systems. By the end of this video, you'll understand how to ensure reliable state management while publishing events effectively.

      <title>Korea TSPs</title>
      <link>https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/korea/index.html</link>
      <description>We have solved a traveling salesman problem (TSP) to walk to 81,998 bars in South Korea.
The problem was created using the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) to build a table of the 3,361,795,003 point-to-point travel times, one for each pair of bar locations.
Our computation produced a tour together with a proof that it is a shortest-possible route to visit all 81,998 stops when measured with the OSRM times.</description>

      <title>Rib :ms_red_panda: (@Rib)</title>
      <link>https://fedi.rib.gay/notes/a6xqityngfubsz0f</link>
      <description>Today Melissa Lewis over on BlueSky pointed out that the font used in the infamous "You wouldn't steal a car" anti-piracy campaign was actually designed by Just van Rossum, whose brother, Guido, created the Python programming language (https://bsky.app/profile/melissa.news/post/3ln7hx5rhcj2v)

She also pointed out that the font had been cloned and released illegally for free under the name "XBAND Rough". Naturally, it would be hilarious if the anti-piracy campaign actually turned out to have used this pirated font, so I went sleuthing and quickly found a PDF from the campaign site with the font embedded (https://web.archive.org/web/20051223202935/http://www.piracyisacrime.com:80/press/pdfs/150605_8PP_brochure.pdf).

So I chucked it into FontForge and yep, turns out the campaign used a pirated font the entire time! 📎</description>

      <title>14 Advanced Python Features</title>
      <link>https://blog.edward-li.com/tech/advanced-python-features/</link>
      <description>Python is one of the most widely adopted programming languages in the world. Yet, because of it’s ease and simplicity to just “get something working”, it’s also one of the most underappreciated.
If you search for Top 10 Advanced Python Tricks on Google or any other search engine, you’ll find tons of blogs or LinkedIn articles going over trivial (but still useful) things like generators or tuples.
However, as someone who’s written Python for the past 12 years, I’ve come across a lot of really interesting, underrated, unique, or (as some might say) “un-pythonic” tricks to really level up what Python can do.</description>

      <description>It is wonderful to see the growing number of people working on digital commons, inventing and improving technologies to the benefit of all humanity. 42 of such projects have been selected for funding in the October call of the NGI Zero Commons Fund. In terms of applications, it was the largest call round in NGI Zero's life time. And we'd like to take this space to thank all applicants for their contributions to an internet for people rather than for profit.</description>
