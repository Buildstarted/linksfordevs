      <title>Reality has a surprising amount of detail</title>
      <link>http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail</link>
      <description>My dad emigrated from Colombia to North America when he was 18 looking looking for a better life. For my brother and I that meant a lot of standing outside in the cold. My dad’s preferred method of improving his lot was improving lots, and my brother and I were “voluntarily” recruited to help working on the buildings we owned.</description>

      <title>Never Use Black by Ian Storm Taylor</title>
      <link>https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/</link>
      <description>One of the most important color tricks I’ve ever learned was to avoid using the color black in my work. Mrs. Zamula, my childhood art teacher, first warned me about black when I was in middle school. And I heard the same again multiple times at RISD. It sounds weird at first, but it’s good advice.</description>

      <link>https://dionhaefner.github.io/2021/12/supercharged-high-resolution-ocean-simulation-with-jax/</link>
      <description>Our Python ocean model Veros (which I maintain) now fully supports JAX as its computational backend. As a result, Veros has much better performance than before on both CPU and GPU, while all model code is still written in Python. In fact, we can now do high-resolution ocean simulations on …</description>

      <title>Keep A Log</title>
      <link>https://bruno-oliveira.github.io/techblog/Keep-a-log/</link>
      <description>One of the most underrated things in the industry, especially when you’re working as a full-time developer, is the power of keeping a “knowledge stash” handy. There’s this perception that knowledge comes through experience, time, or simply osmosis, and, while that can be true over a long enough period of time and for the more superficial knowledge, there are just too many layers in a professional codebase that it’s impossible to grok it immediately.

      <title>Chromium Foundation | Gabriel&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.gabrielsimmer.com/posts/chromium-foundation/</link>
      <description>We need to divorce Chromium from Google   The world of browsers is pretty bleak. We essentially have one viable player, Chromium, flanked by the smaller players of Firefox, spiraling in a slow painful self destruction, and Safari, a browser well optimized for Apple products.
 note: We&amp;#39;re specifically discussing browsers, but you can roughly equate the arguments I make later with the browser&amp;#39;s respective engines.
 The current state of browsers is a difficult one.</description>

      <description>Earlier this month I released a book. This post is about how I wrote it, the tools I used, and what I learned.
I&amp;#39;ve also shared a link to a repo containing all the settings, themes and file structure that I used, which you can take as a starting point for your own writing project.
