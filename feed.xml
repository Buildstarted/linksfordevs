      <title>Theory in practice: Why Treating Metadata as Relations Pays Off</title>
      <link>https://ebellani.github.io/blog/2025/theory-in-practice-why-treating-metadata-as-relations-pays-off/</link>
      <description>Underpinning relational databases you find a very powerful principle: all your information should be represented as attributes drawn from domains in relations(Pascal 2020). This is Codd‚Äôs Information Principle #1. This principle isn‚Äôt just fluffy theory: it can lead to very concrete wins in how we design, query, and maintain systems.1
A practical case: Dependencies for Security Policies This is clearly a metadata question: Which other database objects does this view depend on?</description>

      <title>The Post-Developer Era ‚Ä¢ Josh W. Comeau</title>
      <link>https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-post-developer-era/?from=newsletter</link>
      <description>When OpenAI released GPT-4 back in March 2023, they kickstarted the AI revolution. The consensus online was that front-end development jobs would be totally eliminated within a year or two.Well, it‚Äôs been more than two years since then, and I thought it was worth revisiting some of those early predictions, and seeing if we can glean any insights about where things are headed.</description>

      <title>Hallucinations in LLMs: A Side Effect of Being Trained to Be Right?</title>
      <link>https://coriana.github.io/2025/04/14/llm-hallucinations.html</link>
      <description>I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about hallucinations in large language models lately, and I have a theory: they‚Äôre not just a quirk of imperfect training data or model size. They might actually be caused by instruction tuning - specifically, by how we train these models to always provide correct answers.</description>
