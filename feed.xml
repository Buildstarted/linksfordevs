      <title>Hosting Website on Phone</title>
      <link>https://rohanrd.xyz/posts/hosting-website-on-phone/</link>
      <description>If you follow this blog, you must have come across my previous post that talked about how every phone should be able to host personal website. Well in this post I’m doing exactly that. If you haven’t read that post, please do.
Hosting a website is not that hard. Anyone with Linux server could do it in few key strokes but it’s not that easy on phone. Modern phone operating systems have locked down the phones to a point that anything like hosting website feels like a wild idea.</description>

      <title>Save your disk, write files directly into RAM with /dev/shm</title>
      <link>https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/save-your-disk-write-files-directly-into-ram-with-dev-shm/</link>
      <description>Given my interest in extending the life of my SD cards and hard drives as much as possible, I’m surprised I haven’t come across /dev/shm before. In a word it’s a world-accessible RAM scratchpad, which seems baked right into POSIX, so that virtually every ~Unix~ EDIT: Linux system already has it mounted as a tmpfs by default:
1 2 ❯ mount | grep '/dev/shm' tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,inode64) Today’s lucky 10,000, indeed.</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding is Not an Advantage</title>
      <link>https://asindu.xyz/posts/vibe-coding-is-not-an-advantage/</link>
      <description>A few months ago, I was in a group chat with friends talking about some of the amazing stuff LLMs do.
I told them that I don’t do any “vibe coding”, that is, the building of software exclusively via prompting LLM tools like Cursor. To me LLMs are more of a research tool like Stack Overflow. I ask it questions about stuff I want to do.
It is something for filling my gaps in knowledge. So at the end of the day, I often prefer my own judgement &amp; style. As I don’t think vibe coding is an advantage.</description>

      <title>You can just do things – Creating a pan-European legal entity, the right way | Andreas Klinger</title>

      <description>First the good news: Brussels is convinced, something like EU-Inc will come. Now the bad news: Politicians will create a solution that won’t be useful for founders and investors – unless we stay actively involved in the details. We need your help!</description>
