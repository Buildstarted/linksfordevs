      <title>ChatGPT is bullshit - Ethics and Information Technology</title>
      <link>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5</link>
      <description>Recently, there has been considerable interest in large language models: machine learning systems which produce human-like text and dialogue. Applications of these systems have been plagued by persistent inaccuracies in their output; these are often called “AI hallucinations”. We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.</description>

      <title>GenAI and my six degrees of separation from tensor products</title>
      <link>https://iahmed.me/post/six-degrees-separation-tensor-product/</link>
      <description>Lately I have been working with generative AI applications for work and personal projects. I learned a lot. But, I found learning and application stressful. I had envisioned going on a leisurly drive to sightsee and sample what GenAI has to offer. I quickly found myself in a golf cart on the Machine Learning freeway.
Made with GenHI (Human Intelligence) We are living in a gold rush of foundation models. Every week, new research quickly permeates into user space.</description>

      <title>Debugging hardware is hard</title>
      <link>https://blog.supermechanical.com/2024/06/27/debugging-hardware-is-hard/</link>
      <description>If you want a very technical illustration of why, as they say, hardware is hard, follow along as I debug a communications problem between Pickup’s two main chips.



Day 1



I was working on the bus interface between Pickup’s MCU (the STM32) and its WiFi radio (an ESP32) only to find that the STM32</description>

Why Use Them:
Helps in identifying and fixing security issues on a website. Provides insights into potential attacks or vulnerabilities. Enhances the overall security posture of the website. PCI Compliance report-uri - CSP Directive Legacy CSP directive that is used for reporting violations Deprecated but not all browsers support the newer directives so it is still recommended to be used report-uri Example Content-Security-Policy: .</description>
