      <title>The Decline of Work-Life Balance: A 12-Year Tech Industry Perspective</title>
      <link>https://enginebogie.com/public/charchaa/post/the-decline-of-work-life-balance-a-12-year-tech-industry-perspective/144</link>
      <description>Work-life culture is ruined today. I can say it confidently because I have spent 12+ years in the industry. Situations, now and 12 years back when I started, were pretty different in tech than what they are today.

When I started back in 2012, I remember the situation was not like this. People valued work-life balance. People valued that the employees have a life too outside their work.

I remember a time of around 2014, when I was working on something pretty late like 8 pm or so. And my skip-level manager saw me working. His statement exactly was “Udit never work so late, it harms your health. You should go back home on time”. I never knew in the later years of my career, that I would starve for such a a culture. Since then trust me, nowhere I have experienced the same culture. It is ruining day by day.

Today, the situation is everywhere working at 8 pm is pretty normal and people would expect you to be working at even 11 pm too. And actually, people boast about it. They get promoted for working late creating pressure on others. If someone is completing their work timely and maintaining good work and life, they are called underperformers.

The rant will keep going on. I am not against any specific person. Nor do I think any single person is to blame. But then the shift has happened and I HATE &amp;#128545; it.

I have some theories of my own like what could have led to it. But want to hear what thoughts all of you have?

      <title>Onboarding roulette: deleting our employee accounts daily</title>
      <link>https://graphite.dev/blog/onboarding-roulette</link>
      <description>I’m a strong believer in automated tests - and a moderately disciplined author of them. Software engineering is exceptionally hard to get functionally correct, and even harder to avoid regressing later. As my wise teammate Dave says, “Legacy code is any code that doesn’t have a test.”</description>
