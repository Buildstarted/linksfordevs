      <title>Using SignalR in ASP.NET Core &amp; React to Send Messages</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU-isq-PQ_Y</link>
      <description>A recorded live stream, where we go ahead and install SignalR onto an ASP.NET Core MVC API &amp; React application.

From there, we will create an endpoint in our API where we can send messages to. After that, the API will send out a message to all clients connected stating that the message has been received.

The React application is used to send messages through SignalR. It also is used as a listener, where it receives any message that SignalR sends out.</description>

      <title>PokÃ©mon Sprite Decompression Done By Hand</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVwnUH8Eek</link>
      <description>Donate to The Bail Project here: https://donate.tiltify.com/@retro-game-mechanics-explained/decompress

Don't know what's going on? Check out the video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF1Yw_wu2cM

Webapp for decompressing &amp; compressing sprites: http://www.dotsarecool.com/rgme/tech/gen1decompress.html

During this livestream, I will be collecting donations for The Bail Project. The Bail Project is a non-profit organization that aims to pay bail for those faced with unaffordable cash bail. While bail is intended to be used as an incentive to return to trial, in the recent years it has been used unfairly as a form of pretrial detention. After bail is returned, The Bail Project uses the same money to pay additional bail for others. For more information on The Bail Project, please visit https://bailproject.org/ .

Donations will be done through Tiltify, so your money will be sent directly to The Bail Project without going through me first. Additionally, advertisements and other monetizations like super chats will be disabled for this livestream.

      <title>Programming should be a seperate category from Science &amp; Technology</title>
      <link>https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/310210-discover-browsing-and-searching/suggestions/39899215-programming-should-be-a-seperate-category-from-sci</link>
      <description>Every time I am trying to find a programming or game development stream to watch (which is a very specific type of stream) I get lost in all the growing plants and raising chickens 24/7 streams. While on the other hand there are a lot of programming and or game development streams that really deserve their own category. Being a part of the live-coders community I feel that splitting science &amp; technology in a more granular way would benefit everybody. Both in terms of search-ability and clarity.</description>

      <title>Shared Cache is Going Away</title>
      <link>https://www.jefftk.com/p/shared-cache-is-going-away</link>
      <description>Browsers historically have had a single HTTP Cache. This meant that if  www.a.example and www.b.example both used cdn.example/jquery-1.2.1.js then JQuery would only be downloaded once.
