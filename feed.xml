      <title>The Sci-hub Effect: Sci-hub downloads lead to more article citations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14979</link>
      <description>Citations are often used as a metric of the impact of scientific
publications. Here, we examine how the number of downloads from Sci-hub as well
as various characteristics of publications and their authors predicts future
citations. Using data from 12 leading journals in economics, consumer research,
neuroscience, and multidisciplinary research, we found that articles downloaded
from Sci-hub were cited 1.72 times more than papers not downloaded from Sci-hub
and that the number of downloads from Sci-hub was a robust predictor of future
citations. Among other characteristics of publications, the number of figures
in a manuscript consistently predicts its future citations. The results suggest
that limited access to publications may limit some scientific research from
achieving its full impact.</description>

      <link>https://roberttlange.github.io/posts/2020/06/lottery-ticket-hypothesis/</link>
      <description>Metaphors are powerful tools to transfer ideas from one mind to another. Alan Kay introduced the alternative meaning of the term ‘desktop’ at Xerox PARC in 1970. Nowadays everyone - for a glimpse of a second - has to wonder what is actually meant when referring to a desktop.

      <title>Desugaring - taking our high-level language and simplifying it!</title>
      <link>https://mukulrathi.co.uk/create-your-own-programming-language/lower-language-constructs-to-llvm/</link>
      <description>So far we've talked about checking our Bolt program is correct, but now we're moving on to actually running it. One problem though, a lot of our high-level constructs like objects and methods don't exist in LLVM IR - we need to map them to simpler constructs.</description>

      <link>https://rakhman.info/blog/respecting-browser-navigation-spa/</link>
      <description>Anchors (&lt;a href="..."&gt;) offer a simple concept for navigating between web pages. Clicking on them opens the URL. When using the left mouse button, the HTML decides if the page is opened in the same tab (default) or in a new tab (target="_blank"). Browsers provide the user with the possibility to override this behavior by middle clicking, CTRL clicking or using the context menu.</description>

      <link>https://yenkel.dev/posts/a-tale-of-latency-and-broken-windows</link>
      <description>Latency can get out of control because of small day to day changes. Dedicate a small amount of time to think about latency when making changes to keep it under control. parallel I/O, pre-fetching, and avoiding I/O are some simple techniques you can use.</description>
