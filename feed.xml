      <title>Batching Updates and Inserts: Making EF Core Work Smarter, Not Harder - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/batching-updates-and-inserts-making-ef-core-work-smarter-not-harder/</link>
      <description>Let’s face it: making multiple database calls is like running back and forth between the kitchen and dining room to serve dinner one plate at a time. It’s inefficient, exhausting, and makes your app look like it’s stuck in the Stone Age. But with batching in EF Core, you can wave goodbye to this inefficiency. It&amp;#39;s the magic trick that lets you update or insert multiple records in a single trip to the database, making you and your app more productive and efficient. Batching is all about doing more with less. It minimizes round trips to the database, saves resources, and makes your app faster. Understanding and implementing batching in EF Core is like gaining a superpower-it makes your app work smarter, not harder, and gives you a sense of control and confidence in your development process.</description>

      <title>How To Run Deepseek R1 671b Fully Locally On a $2000 EPYC Server – Digital Spaceport</title>
      <link>https://digitalspaceport.com/how-to-run-deepseek-r1-671b-fully-locally-on-2000-epyc-rig/</link>
      <description>Let’s start with the good news. I got very solid performance off the same baseline AMD EPYC Rome system that has been at the core of our entire journey  That initial parts selection has remained fantastic! Owners of that system are going to get some great news today also as they can hit between 4.25 to 3.5 TPS (tokens per second) on the Q4 671b full model. This is important as the distilled versions are simply not the same at all. They are vastly inferior and other models out perform them handily. Running the full model, with a 16K or greater context window, is indeed the pathway to the real experience and it is worthwhile. Since this runs decent enough on CPU alone it also can hang out while you run smaller models, like vision models, at the same time. To reiterate, this will not fully run in only GPU VRAM alone unless you have a massive rig. I will show you all the tips and tricks to get this working. It is not “easy” but if you like tech tinkering it is a lot of fun.</description>

      <title>Falsehoods programmers believe about null pointers</title>
      <link>https://purplesyringa.moe/blog/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-null-pointers/</link>
      <description>Null pointers look simple on the surface, and that’s why they’re so dangerous. As compiler optimizations, intuitive but incorrect simplifications, and platform-specific quirks have piled on, the odds of making a wrong assumption have increased, leading to the proliferation of bugs and vulnerabilities.
This article explores common misconceptions about null pointers held by many programmers, starting with simple fallacies and working our way up to the weirdest cases. Some of them will be news only to beginners, while others may lead experts down the path of meticulous fact-checking. Without further ado, let’s dive in.</description>

      <description>While .NET 8&amp;#39;s standard resilience handlers provide excellent defaults for HTTP clients, they lack built-in support for overriding these handlers for specific endpoints that require different resilience strategies. This article demonstrates how to implement a custom solution for overriding default handlers and discusses upcoming improvements planned by the .NET team.</description>

      <title>Beat the Drum</title>
      <link>https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/beat-the-drum</link>
      <description>My former COO gave me a
piece of advice when I became a manager. He said that leaders have to deliver
the same message again and again and again to make sure it gets through to
everyone in the organization. Sometimes, it’s also necessary to simplify the
message and lose some nuance for it to actually sink in. The advice made sense
to me at the time, but it became more concrete to me as I tried to apply it and
as I noticed when leaders above me failed to do it. I brought it up to my former
COO recently, and he put it in a fantastically pithy way by saying “yep, you
have to beat the drum.”</description>

      <title>The First Ten Years</title>
      <link>https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2025/01/30/first-ten-years/</link>
      <description>In 2012, I started teaching myself programming. Around this time, I read Peter Norvig’s essay, Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years. Norvig’s thesis is that learning to program takes much more time than people like to admit. I found this a comforting voice of reason in a time when “just learn to code” felt like a cultural mantra. Norvig gave me license to slow down.</description>
