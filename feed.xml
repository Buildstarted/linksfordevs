      <description>This is end of my blog post series on cryptography with hardware. 
I‚Äôve written about smart cards and secure elements in part 1 and about HSMs and TPMs in part 2.
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
So far, all of the hardware solutions we‚Äôve talked about have been standalone secure hardware solutions (with the exceptions of smart cards which can be seen as tiny computers).

      <title>Watching More Files With Dotnet Watch For Static Sites</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/watching-more-files-with-dotnet-watch-for-static-sites</link>
      <description>The marriage of .NET Core and static site generators is a beautiful thing. There are many great static site generator options out there like 11ty, Jekyll, Hugo, and many more. While you can accomplish amazing feats at build time, a dynamic backend can allow your application features that are not possible at build time. The combination of .NET Core and the static site generator of your choice is a powerful one-two punch. In this post, I‚Äôll show you how to set up an ASP.NET Core application hosting a static site generator, with the added ability to watch all files within your project.</description>

      <title>500 Free Computer Science Courses from the World‚Äôs Top CS Universities</title>
      <link>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/free-courses-top-cs-universities/</link>
      <description>Every year, Class Central publishes rankings of the world‚Äôs highest rated and
most popular online courses.

These rankings are based on user ratings and total enrollments. You can see the
full annual course ratings here [https://www.classcentral.com/rankings].

But in this article, I'm going to adopt a different approach. Instead of just
showing the top courses, I'll show you which universities seem to have the best
courses overall, then show you all the free online courses those universities

      <description>A year ago, Microsoft enabled .NET developers to work with Apache Spark using C# or F#, instead of Python or Scala. More functionality and performance enhancements have since been layered on. The result shows how software world demarcations can be transcended.</description>

      <title>Jevons Paradox &amp; The Rebound Effect</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTfwhbfMnNc</link>
      <description>When efficiency increases, consumption drops, right? Errr... No.. So far, increased efficiency has mostly lead to increased consumption.  

This is called Jevons Paradox, discovered by William Stanley Jevons in 1865. He was concerned that improved steam engines would make England run out of coal faster!

      <title>San Francisco, California and the 1918-1919 Influenza Epidemic</title>
      <link>https://www.influenzaarchive.org/cities/city-sanfrancisco.html</link>
      <description>As in every city, it is impossible to know just how the first case of influenza was contracted in San Francisco. According to contemporary newspaper reports, however, a local man who had returned to his home after a recent trip to Chicago brought the disease to San Francisco. Learning of the case on September 23, San Francisco Health Officer Dr. William C. Hassler ordered the man to the city hospital and placed his home under quarantine. The hope was that these actions might stop the spread of the disease in its tracks, sparing San Francisco from an epidemic. However, by October 9 the city had at least 169 cases of influenza. Only a week later that number had jumped to over 2,000. San Francisco‚Äôs epidemic had started.1</description>
