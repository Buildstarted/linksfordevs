      <title>Using a web camera with fun filters in your ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly application – Roman Simuta</title>
      <link>https://romansimuta.com/posts/using-a-web-camera-with-fun-filters-in-your-asp-net-core-blazor-webassembly-application/</link>
      <description>There are many things that you can do with Web Camera in your Web Application. For example, you can make a portrait picture and send it to the ML service to identify your age. Or you can take a picture of the sky and try to identify whether outside. Or you can apply some photo filters and get some fun :).</description>

      <description>In my line of work, we talk a lot about security warning design and effectiveness. Usually, the task of a warning is to prevent a user from doing something dangerous, such as accepting an invalid certificate or installing malware. There’s another class of warnings which tell users that something bad has already happened, with the aim of helping them recover. I’ll call this category after-the-fact warnings.</description>

      <title>The Myth of Harmonious Indigenous Conservationism - Quillette</title>
      <link>https://quillette.com/2020/09/06/the-myth-of-harmonious-indigenous-conservationism/</link>
      <description>It seems like a long time ago. But only six months ago, pundits had convinced themselves that the great morality tale of our time was playing out in an obscure part of British Columbia. Following on an internal political fight within the Wet’suwet’en First Nation over a local pipeline project, one columnist wrote that “the Indigenous people of Earth have become the conscience of humanity. In this dire season, it is time to listen to them.” In fact, the elected leadership of the Wet’suwet’en had chosen to participate in the controverted pipeline project. The nationwide protests against the pipeline that followed were, in fact, sparked by unelected “hereditary” chiefs who long have received government signing bonuses. It’s unclear how this qualifies them for the exalted status of humanity’s conscience. Yet the whole weeks-long saga, which featured urban protestors appearing alongside their Indigenous counterparts at road and rail barricades throughout Canada, tapped into a strongly held noble-savage belief system within progressive circles. Various formulations of this mythology have become encoded in public land acknowledgments, college courses, …</description>

      <title>For the Future of Work, Look to Gaming</title>
      <link>https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/09/06/work.html</link>
      <description>In 2002, my mom started a new job in finance. One day, I visited her office. As part of the grand tour, she showed me her Lotus Notes setup on her PC, and explained that she received around 400 emails a day. This baffled my eleven year old mind: “why don’t you guys just use MSN?” My friends at school used Microsoft’s Messenger for everything. Some of my friends in the US had me hopping on AOL, but either one seemed obviously better than my mom and her highly-paid colleagues shooting one-line emails through their bulky setups. Nearly twenty years later, Slack and Microsoft Teams are finally making real-time chat commonplace even among the most traditional enterprises.</description>

      <link>https://weinholt.se/articles/non-posix-filesystems/</link>
      <description>Operating systems and file systems have traditionally been developed
hand in hand. They impose mutual constraints on each other. Today we
have two major leaders in file system semantics: Windows and POSIX.
They are very close to each other when compared to the full set of
possibilities. Interesting things happened before POSIX monopolized
file system semantics.</description>

      <title>Home - History of .NET</title>
      <link>https://historyofdot.net/</link>
      <description>Back in 2017, there was a party celebrating the 15th anniversary of .NET shipping.
                    I had the opportunity to do some short interviews with folks at the party that were part of .NET way back at the beginning.
                    You can see some of those interviews on Channel 9 at Happy Birthday .NET!
                    After the evening was over, it occured to me that we needed to write these stories down before they get lost.
                    That was the beginning of what has evolved into a multi-year effort to collect the tales that led to the creation and evolution of .NET.
                    The book has been coming for awhile now, sign up here to be kept up-to-date on its development and the many stories behind creating it!</description>

      <title>Why I Link to WayBackMachine Instead of Original Site</title>
      <link>https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/</link>
      <description>When linking to a page for the purpose of reference, it seems better to me to link to the archive of a given page, rather than to the original site itself.
This ensures that after some years have gone by, my article is guaranteed to be consistent. Due the changing nature of the web, there is a chance that after some years, the link could lead to a:
 404 / Not Found (most common) Changed or edited content, or entirely replaced content Content that, due to a rise in popularity, is now shielded, demanding the user to make an account to read the entire article.</description>

      <title>Create React App vs Next.js vs Gatsby</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFXQRONQqGA</link>
      <description>There are lots of options when building React applications so where do you start? Create React App is probably the most common starting point, but have you looked at Next.js and Gatsby? They are two frameworks built on top of React that bring features like building State Pages, Server Side Rendered Pages, built-in routing, etc.

      <description>This is a fix so that noda types can co-exist with bcl types until clean support for multiple type handlers will be implemented.
