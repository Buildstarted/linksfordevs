      <title>NVIDIA is full of shit</title>
      <link>https://blog.sebin-nyshkim.net/posts/nvidia-is-full-of-shit/</link>
      <description>Since the disastrous launch of the RTX 50 series, NVIDIA has been unable to escape negative headlines: scalper bots are snatching GPUs away from consumers before official sales even begin, power connectors continue to melt, with no fix in sight, marketing is becoming increasingly deceptive, GPUs are missing processing units when they leave the factory, and the drivers, for which NVIDIA has always been praised, are currently falling apart. And to top it all off, NVIDIA is becoming increasingly insistent that media push a certain narrative when reporting on their hardware.</description>

      <title>Intra: design notes on an LLM-driven text adventure</title>
      <link>https://ianbicking.org/blog/2025/07/intra-llm-text-adventure</link>
      <description>Last year I participated in a text adventure hackathon to build a text-based game using AI. I’d already been thinking about it but it was a great opportunity to put together those thoughts into something real. Since then I made many improvements, and while I’ve shelved the project for other endeavors I still want to write up what I’ve learned along the way.</description>

      <description>I read an interesting post recently about creating a hackable AI assistant. There were a lot of things that appealed to me about it:

 * Simple. Not using abstractions like LangChain which have always felt a bit heavy to me
 * Custom context. Collect the data you need in regular code and</description>

      <description>When I write about the greatness of text adventures, I pretend they are easy to
make. They are, compared to many other types of games, but it’s still a bit of a
lie. They’re hard to make.</description>

      <title>Process Vs Prejudice</title>
      <link>https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/process-vs-prejudice/</link>
      <description>I recently read an interesting article about Accountability Sinks. In it, the author argues that part of the reason for having business processes is that they diffuse accountability.  Every one of us has tried to have an argument with an employee of a big company, and it always goes like this:  the human being you are speaking to is only allowed to follow a set of processes and rules that pass on …</description>
