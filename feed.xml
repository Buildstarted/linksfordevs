      <title>No more boot loader: Please use the kernel instead DevConf.CZ</title>
      <link>https://pretalx.com/devconf-cz-2024/talk/W3AVCT/</link>
      <description>We are working on a new scheme to replace the GRUB bootloader with a fast, secure, Linux-based, user-space solution: nmbl (for no more boot loader).
Most people are familiar with GRUB, a powerful, flexible, fully-featured bootloader that is used on multiple architectures (x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le OpenFirmware). Although GRUB is quite versatile and capable, its features create complexity that is difficult to maintain, and that both duplicate and lag behind the Linux kernel while also creating numerous security holes. On the other hand, the Linux kernel, which has a large developer base, benefits from fast feature development, quick responses to vulnerabilities and greater overall scrutiny.
We (Red Hat boot loader engineering) will present our solution to this problem, which is to use the Linux kernel as its own bootloader. Loaded by the EFI stub on UEFI, and packed into a unified kernel image (UKI), the kernel, initramfs, and kernel command line, contain everything they need to reach the final boot target. All necessary drivers, filesystem support, and networking are already built in and code duplication is avoided. 
We will showcase the work done so far, and ask you for your feedback and use cases.</description>

      <title>A Mini Monitor for a Pi</title>
      <link>https://noamzeise.com/2024/07/05/mini-monitor.html</link>
      <description>This post outlines how I used a small 2 inch display as a monitor for my pi. Where it can display tty terminals and X desktops and applications as if it was a normal screen connected over hdmi. My overall goal is to have a sort of handheld “console” that I can connect a keyboard to and use as a normal computer. This post implements the display functionality needed to fulfill part of the goal. I lay out the steps needed for interacting with the display over spi and the issues I encountered trying to use it like a monitor. The end result is a system service that runs on startup, consuming 2.5 mb of ram and ~2% of the CPU. It also respects the X display power management system (dpms) to save on battery life by going to sleep and turning the backlight off.</description>

      <title>On Burnout, Mental Health, And Not Being Okay — Ludicity</title>
      <link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/on-burnout-mental-health-and-not-being-okay/</link>
      <description>This blog did so many hits last week that the host platform experienced timeouts. I&amp;#39;ve been invited onto podcasts, and offered both small technical projects and journalism work, of all things. It was a crazy time. But the internet moves on, as it always does, and I am left, as we all always are, to figure out what to write about next.</description>

      <description>While browsing Hacker News one day, I came across this post. It shows an intense segment of getting MicroPython running on a $3 smartwatch. I was not interested in so much work. But maybe you are. Either way, it got me thinking about MicroPython and tiny portal computing environments.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Hallucinations in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/</link>
      <description>Hallucination in large language models usually refers to the model generating unfaithful, fabricated, inconsistent, or nonsensical content. As a term, hallucination has been somewhat generalized to cases when the model makes mistakes. Here, I would like to narrow down the problem of hallucination to be when the model output is fabricated and not grounded by either the provided context or world knowledge.
There are two types of hallucination:
In-context hallucination: The model output should be consistent with the source content in context.</description>

      <title>Personality Basins | near.blog</title>
      <link>https://near.blog/personality-basins/</link>
      <description>Personality basins are the mental model that I use to reason about humans within their environment. They are an elucidating way to think about many concepts: from modelling why people are they way they are, how they change over time, how mental illnesses and addiction function along with how we should look for their cures, and how the attention economy optimizes itself to consume all of your free time.</description>
