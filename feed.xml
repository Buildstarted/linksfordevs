      <title>Human evals are outsourced vibe checks</title>
      <link>https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/human-evals-are-outsourced-vibe-checks/</link>
      <description>Engineering has always been about measurement and evaluation. But when it comes to LLMs, traditional approaches to evaluation don’t work as cleanly as they do for other software systems.
Of course, evals and benchmarks are an important signal (perhaps the only signal) of raw capability. They show us improvement over time. The fact that many of the original benchmarks from a year or so ago are at or near saturation also tells us a lot.</description>

      <description>In this, the third and final part of this series, I’m going to present 10
recommendations for avoiding the pitfalls of using bucketed prioritisation (e.g.
must haves, nice to haves, etc.), covered in the previous two parts.</description>

      <title>It is no longer safe to move our governments and societies to US clouds - Bert Hubert&amp;#39;s writings</title>
      <link>https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/you-can-no-longer-base-your-government-and-society-on-us-clouds/</link>
      <description>The very short version: it is madness to continue transferring the running of European societies and governments to American clouds. Not only is it a terrible idea given the kind of things the “King of America” keeps saying, the legal sophistry used to justify such transfers, like the nonsense letter the Dutch cabinet sent last week, has now been invalidated by Trump himself. And why are we doing this? Convenience.</description>

      <description>Terraform isn&amp;#39;t just a fancy tool for spinning up VMs—it’s the backbone of modern cloud automation. Whether you&amp;#39;re managing multi-cloud environments, automating disaster recovery, or deploying Kubernetes clusters, Terraform has got you covered. In this post, we’ll dive into practical use cases where Terraform truly shines, proving that Infrastructure as Code (IaC) isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a game-changer.</description>

      <title>Ask for no, don’t ask for yes – Dan Moore!</title>
      <link>https://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/3518</link>
      <description>I think it is important to have a bias for action. Like anything else, this is something you can make a habit of. Moving forward allows you to make progress. I don’t know about you, but I’ve frozen up in the past not knowing what the right path was for me. Moving forward, even the smallest possible step, helped break that stasis.</description>

      <description>I was watching overview of TempoLabs and my initial impression was “wow, that’s a lot of stuff” as they not only have AI generation but it seems they understand at least the basics of a software devlelopment process. When you invoke the AI generation, it firstly parrots back its understanding of what you’ve asked for. ... Read more</description>
