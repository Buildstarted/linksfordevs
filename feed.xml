      <description>The first time people uses a vpn, what they go to see first is &amp;quot;how fast we are.&amp;quot; And if &amp;quot;we are very fast, &amp;#160;&amp;quot;we are inclined&amp;quot; to think that &amp;quot;we are dealing with a good product, which produces little overhead.

      <title>Monitor radiation with a Raspberry Pi</title>
      <link>https://nbailey.ca/post/radiation-monitor/</link>
      <description>I have an odd fascination with radiation… Not to the point that I’m buying “Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials” (or NORMs for short) on eBay, but certainly to the point that I own a digital geiger counter and regularly measure… things…
Recently, I discovered https://radmon.org, a site where users can connect a counter to their API and send data to the network of scientists that study background radiation in real time.</description>

      <title>Building my first mechanical keyboard</title>
      <link>https://not-matthias.github.io/posts/mechanical-keyboard/</link>
      <description>A friend of mine recently brought up his custom mechanical keyboard while we were hanging out in voice chat, and at first, nobody understood why anyone would buy one. At that time, I had no clue that there are entire communities about building custom keyboards. With every sentence that was said, we got deeper into this community. We explored different YouTube channels, watched comparisons, and listened to sound tests.</description>

      <description>Finally! On May 19, 2022, GitHub released one of its most requested features: Math support on Markdown! Many had been anticipating this for years, including myself, so much in fact that I wrote a browser extension to get there early. (xhub, it can do a few other things so check it out.)</description>

      <link>https://www.kalzumeus.com/2022/05/20/tether-required-recapitalization/</link>
      <description>In 2019, after years of following along, I described Tether as “the internal accounting system for the largest fraud since Madoff.” This remains true. I made many very specific claims in that essay, which have been borne out in detail in the NYAG settlement and CFTC settlement. I won’t rehash all of them here.</description>
