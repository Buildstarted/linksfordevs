      <title>GUIs are Antisocial</title>
      <link>https://mtlynch.io/notes/guis-are-antisocial/</link>
      <description>
    
      Last week, I was listening to the CoRecursive podcast interview with PowerShell’s lead architect, Jeffrey Snover.
One moment in that interview has been stuck in my head the whole week is when Snover argues that graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are inherently “antisocial”:
I realized that — you know, that the mouse is antisocial. The GUI is antisocial. So what’s that mean? You have a problem to solve, and you solve it with the GUI.

What Casey says sounds counter-intuitive for anyone from a traditional OOP software background. He suggests not committing to an organization of data</description>

      <link>https://www.alexirpan.com/2024/07/08/tragedies-of-reality.html</link>
      <description>In 2023, I was at an ML conference. The night was young, the drinks were flowing, and the topic turned to a question: “if you could take any machine learning subfield, and give all their
resources to a different one, what are you killing and what are you boosting?”

      <title>The missing parts in Cargo</title>
      <link>https://weihanglo.tw/posts/2024/the-missing-parts-in-cargo/</link>
      <description>When people discuss the merits of Rust, they often mention its strict ownership rules, excellent diagnostics, and impressive performance. Cargo and the crates.io ecosystem frequently receive praise as well. Initially, when I started learning Rust, I couldn’t understand why Cargo was so highly loved. Having extensive experience with JavaScript, I was accustomed to convenient package managers and couldn’t grasp the enthusiasm—wasn’t such a tool a given for any serious programming language?</description>
