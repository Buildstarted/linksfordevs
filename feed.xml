      <link>https://www.umber.me/blog/use-your-product-as-a-customer</link>
      <description>Tip for anyone in product &amp;amp;amp; design: always use your own product the way your customers do. I don&amp;#39;t mean a quick functional test– I mean a real user scenario from start to finish.  Case in point: I suspect the team at HubSpot has never really tried to send an email to a non-marketing contact </description>

      <title>Water rendering in Gradient</title>
      <link>https://jysandy.github.io/posts/gradient-water-rendering/</link>
      <description>I set out to create a water rendering system for Gradient, my DirectX 11 renderer project. As someone new to graphics programming, diving into water rendering has been both exciting and challenging. This blog post shares my experience building my first water rendering system, from understanding the basics at first to refining and achieving visually appealing results.
Wave modelling and generation One of the most important components of water rendering is deforming a mesh to simulate waves convincingly.</description>

      <title>A surprising scam email that evaded Gmail&amp;#39;s spam filter</title>
      <link>https://jamesbvaughan.com/phishing/</link>
      <description>I received a surprising scammy email today, and I ended up learning some things about email security as a result.
Here’s the email:
I was about to mark it as spam in Gmail and move on, but I noticed a couple things that intrigued me.
At first glance, this appeared to be a legitimate PayPal invoice email. It looked like someone set their seller name to be “Don’t recognize the seller?Quickly let us know +1(888) XXX-XXXX”, but with non-ASCII numerals, probably to avoid some automated spam detection.</description>

      <title>A Journey Through Code and Concepts – Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/from-c-to-rust-a-journey-through-code-and-concepts/</link>
      <description>Welcome to my epic blog series, where we pit C# against Rust in a friendly, code-slinging showdown! If you’re a C# developer curious about Rust’s quirks and power or a Rustacean interested in how your language compares to the polished .NET ecosystem, you’ve come to the right place.</description>

      <title>100x Defect Tolerance: How Cerebras Solved the Yield Problem - Cerebras</title>
      <link>https://cerebras.ai/blog/100x-defect-tolerance-how-cerebras-solved-the-yield-problem</link>
      <description>Conventional wisdom in semiconductor manufacturing has long held that bigger chips mean worse yields. Yet at Cerebras, we’ve successfully built and commercialized a chip 50x larger than the largest computer chips – and achieved comparable yields. This seeming paradox is one of our most frequently asked questions: how do we achieve a usable yield with a wafer-scale processor?</description>

      <title>A Personal Note From Our Founder – Hindenburg Research</title>
      <link>https://hindenburgresearch.com/gratitude/</link>
      <description>As I’ve shared with family, friends and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research. The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.</description>

      <description>I think about music in years. 2024 was the first year in a long time that I didn&amp;#39;t have anything to do with Spotify Wrapped, but that was never why I thought about music in years, and certainly never how. I like my music data to tell me stories about music not about graphic design, and in verifiable numbers not templated snarkiness. I want to stand at the end of one year and the brink of another and think clearly about how I&amp;#39;ve been listening, and thus living, and expansively about how I might.</description>

      <title>Beating cuBLAS in Single-Precision General Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://salykova.github.io/sgemm-gpu</link>
      <description>In this blog post, we’ll walk through an implementation of the SGEMM (Single-precision GEneral Matrix Multiply) operation defined as C := alpha*A*B + beta*C. We will review three different kernels, each optimized for specific matrix size problems. Our final implementation is optimized for Ampere architecture and outperforms cuBLAS on wide range of matrix size problems.</description>

      <title>Real Semantic Versioning</title>
      <link>https://kidger.site/thoughts/real-sem-ver/</link>
      <description>Semantic version (SemVer) is possibly the most widely used software versioning scheme.
We all know how SemVer works: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. The first number is for backward-incompatible changes, the middle number is for backward-compatible new features, and the last number is for backward-compatible bugfixes.
…it’s a shame how infrequently it actually seems to be used this way!
Backward incompatible changes on minor versions happen all the time. By far the most common example are deprecations, even amongst libraries that claim to follow SemVer.</description>

Now, you want to write tests but calling the APIs or LLMs during tests would make them slow, non-deterministic, and dependent on network availability.</description>
