      <title>The Internet Is Full of AI Dogshit - Aftermath</title>
      <link>https://aftermath.site/the-internet-is-full-of-ai-dogshit</link>
      <description>The Internet used to be so simple to use that people collectively coined the term “let me Google that for you” to make fun of people who had the audacity of asking other people questions online. In the future I fear that people will have no other choice but to ask people for information from the Internet, because right now it’s all full of AI dogshit.</description>

      <title>.NET Rocks! .NET 8 Migration with Jimmy Bogard</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1880</link>
      <description>How do you migrate to .NET 8? Carl and Richard talk to Jimmy Bogard about his experiences helping teams migrate from .NET Framework 4.8 to more modern versions of .NET. Jimmy talks about the team wanting to be able to use ASP.NET Core in their applications as the incentive to make the migration in the first place. The conversation digs into landing on .NET 6 to make migration easier but then wanting to move quickly to later versions to take advantage of the latest features. And no dead-drop migrations - using a reverse proxy to operate the two applications side-by-side so that over months, everything moves across while remaining functional - a great story of migration!</description>

      <title>Teaching using manipulatives</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/manipulatives/</link>
      <description>Listened to the latest episode of the CS Ed Podcast yesterday. It featured Colleen Lewis, of CS Teaching Tips fame talking about how she uses manipulatives. Much like Colleens session last SIGCSE on microteaching this episode made me both happy and sad.
Happy because it&amp;#39;s awesome that Colleen is bringing attention to strong classroom teaching practices and she&amp;#39;s sharing good stuff. Sad because these are things rarely talked about in teaching CS or college level teaching in general.</description>

      <description>For some unfathomable reason, Windows 11 has removed the Sharing Tab on the Explorer Properties Context menu by default. The Sharing Tab allows you to shared folders and drives for remote access. In this post I discuss how to get the Sharing Tab back and also touch on how to make sure your machine can actually accept remote connections so you can share your folders and drives.</description>

      <title>Nix from the bottom up</title>
      <link>http://www.chriswarbo.net/projects/nixos/bottom_up.html</link>
      <description>This page describes what Nix
fundamentally is, at its core; what it is actually doing when
it runs; and why it makes the choices that it does. This won’t tell you
what commands you need to run, or which of the Nixpkgs override
functions you should call to swap out that broken dependency you’ve
found; but hopefully it will give you a clearer picture of what’s
happening, what’s possible, and maybe steer you in the right
direction.</description>

      <title>The Butterfly Effect of Altering Prompts: How Small Changes and Jailbreaks Affect Large Language Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://abelsalinas.me/posts/butterfly-effect/</link>
      <description>Do variations in prompt change the ultimate decision of the LLM? Using a series of prompt variations across a variety of text classification tasks, we show how even the smallest of perturbations, such as adding a space at the end of a prompt, can change an LLM&amp;#39;s answer.</description>

      <title>Quantifying your documentation&amp;#39;s success — Rami James</title>
      <link>https://www.ramijames.com/thoughts/quantifying-your-documentations-success</link>
      <description>The primary challenge faced by technical writers often boils down to how to evaluate the effectiveness of what you write. You build some documentation and you think it is great. How do you know if you are right? How do you prove it to upper management? How do you really, really know?</description>

      <title>Understanding Bridge-Based Ranking</title>
      <link>https://jonathanwarden.com/understanding-bridge-based-ranking/</link>
      <description>Introduction Bridge-Based Ranking is an alternative way to score and rank content by adjusting for user polarization.
The most successful implementation of Bridge-Based Ranking, X&amp;amp;rsquo;s Community Notes, explains that the algorithm favors notes that are rated highly by users across a &amp;amp;ldquo;diversity of perspectives&amp;amp;rdquo;. But as I show in this article, ratings from users with diverse perspectives are not necessary for a note to rank highly. It is somewhat more accurate to say that the note must be highly rated regardless of diversity of perspective.</description>

      <title>Are any of your features the steak on the menu?</title>
      <link>https://ntietz.com/blog/the-steak-on-the-menu/</link>
      <description>At my first job, we were a distributed team and would get together often.
When we went out to eat, one of my coworkers would always order the steak if it was anywhere on the menu.
Every single time we went to some Ohio restaurant that had truly lackluster steak, he&amp;#39;d order it anyway.</description>
