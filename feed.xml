      <description>Everyone is grappling with these questions right now: can remote teams produce
the same results as in-person teams? Do companies need to go remote to stay
competitive in the technology job market? What effects, if any, would a sea
change in remote work have on the way we engage with our occupations?</description>

      <title>Dabbling in Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/crypt.html</link>
      <description>This note tells the story of some work that I was involved with, but
to which I was not a primary contributor.  For reasons that should
become clear, the people most involved have not gone public with their results.
Still, it is one of the more interesting things I&amp;#39;ve done and seen.
The central events occurred around 1977.
Jim Reeds reminds me that the incident was already babbled to
John Markoff and recorded in the book by Markoff and Katie Hafner (Cyberpunk: Outlaws
and Hackers on the Computer Frontier, Simon and Schuster, 1991).
This note doesn&amp;#39;t differ materially from that account, but might be a bit more complete.</description>

      <title>Ether as a computation unit</title>
      <link>https://blog.merwanedrai.com/2021/04/24/ether-as-a-computation-unit.html</link>
      <description>The Bitcoin community dreams of Hyperbitcoinization, and believes the endgame of bitcoin (or satoshis, a smaller denomination of it) is to become a major unit of account. Their idea is to have things commercially priced in bitcoin rather than the local currency. I don’t know if the Ethereum community shares the same vision for Ether, but this isn’t necessarily what is needed, or the best we can get out of the cryptocurrency.</description>

      <title>Books I&amp;#39;ve Read (2020)</title>
      <link>http://devinlogan.org/e-readers.html</link>
      <description>I’ve never been a fan of e-readers. I’m put off by the prospect of paying for a book that only exists on a device, especially when the price of e-books approaches or exceeds the cost of physical books (especially the used copies I tend to buy).

      <title>C++ coroutines: What does it mean when I declare my coroutine as noexcept? | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210426-00/?p=105153</link>
      <description>Suppose you want a coroutine that terminates on unhandled exceptions, or equivalently (looking at it from the consumer side) a coroutine that never throws an exception when awaited. For regular functions, the way to say this is to put the noexcept exception specification on your function declaration: int GetValue() noexcept {   return LoadValue();</description>
