      <description>One of the first &amp;quot;oh no&amp;quot; moments for folks new to distributed tracing is the needle in the haystack problem. Someone reports an error, you go look for traces in your tool (Azure Monitor or whatever), and because there are thousands of traces, you can&amp;#39;t easily figure out which is</description>

      <description>Remember when we used to joke around, debate about politics, have a drink afterwards and hug your friend with a different political view. Remember when we would switch on the news and just casually criticize whatever dumb shit both the political parties were doing. Ahh those were the days.

      <title>AIR-FI: Generating Covert Wi-Fi Signals from Air-Gapped Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06884</link>
      <description>In this paper, we show that attackers can exfiltrate data from air-gapped
computers via Wi-Fi signals. Malware in a compromised air-gapped computer can
generate signals in the Wi-Fi frequency bands. The signals are generated
through the memory buses - no special hardware is required. Sensitive data can
be modulated and secretly exfiltrated on top of the signals. We show that
nearby Wi-Fi capable devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops, IoT devices) can
intercept these signals, decode them, and send them to the attacker over the
Internet. To extract the signals, we utilize the physical layer information
exposed by the Wi-Fi chips. We implement the transmitter and receiver and
discuss design considerations and implementation details. We evaluate this
covert channel in terms of bandwidth and distance and present a set of
countermeasures. Our evaluation shows that data can be exfiltrated from
air-gapped computers to nearby Wi-Fi receivers located a distance of several
meters away.</description>

      <title>Why does PF_VIRT_FIRMWARE_ENABLED return false even when virtualization is enabled in the firmware? | The Old New Thing</title>

      <description>The Is&amp;#173;Processor&amp;#173;Feature&amp;#173;Present function has a processor feature called PF_VIRT_FIRMWARE_ENABLED. A customer enabled virtualization in their firmware, but calling Is&amp;#173;Processor&amp;#173;Feature&amp;#173;Present with that feature still returned FALSE. Why is this function lying? It’s not lying. Even if you enable virtualization in firmware, it may not actually be available.</description>

      <title>To the brain, reading computer code is not the same as reading language</title>
      <link>https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215</link>
      <description>MIT neuroscientists have found reading computer code does not rely on the regions of the brain involved in language processing. Instead, it activates the “multiple demand network,” which is also recruited for complex cognitive tasks such as solving math problems or crossword puzzles.</description>
