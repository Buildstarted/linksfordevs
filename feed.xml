      <title>David Foster Walleye (Sic) - kolyder</title>
      <link>https://kolyder.com/david-foster-walleye-sic/</link>
      <description>David Foster Walleye are born in one of two ways. The most popular way is with “This is Water,” a commencement speech in which a sweaty David Foster Wallace doles out capital-T Truth to graduates as they molt into new beings, letting fresh air touch the raw nerve of their budding adulthood. He starts with a self-deprecation: “If anybody feels like perspiring, I’d invite you to go ahead because I’m sure going to.” Then he delivers what becomes, for many, an annual ritual — a yearly touchstone that describes life as, mostly, a string of dull and ordinary moments that take deliberate attention to appreciate.</description>

      <description>So there&amp;#39;s a bunch of noise going around a sneaky forced Google Pixel 4a update that seems to cripple batteries... and this is quite interesting.

Old kernel:

```
Linux version 4.14.302-g6ff6ddc33f7d-ab10092322 (android-build@abfarm-2004-4012) (Android (7284624, based on r416183b) clang version 12.0.5 (https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/llvm-project c935d99d7cf2016289302412d708641d52d2f7ee), LLD 12.0.5 (/buildbot/src/android/llvm-toolchain/out/llvm-project/lld c935d99d7cf2016289302412d708641d52d2f7ee)) #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue May 9 09:35:06 UTC 2023
```

New kernel:

```
Linux version 4.14.302-g92e0d94b6cba (hsiufangho@hsiufanghocloud0.c.googlers.com) (Android (7284624, based on r416183b) clang version 12.0.5 (https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/llvm-project c935d99d7cf2016289302412d708641d52d2f7ee), LLD 12.0.5 (/buildbot/src/android/llvm-toolchain/out/llvm-project/lld c935d99d7cf2016289302412d708641d52d2f7ee)) #1 repo:t-dev-msm-pixel-4.14-tm-qpr3 SMP PREEMPT Tue Nov 12 11:1
```

Compare these paths:
```
/buildbot/src/partner-android/t-dev-msm-pixel-4.14-tm-qpr3/private/msm-google/arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S
/usr/local/google/home/hsiufangho/android-msm-pixel-4.14-tm-qpr3/private/msm-google/arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S
```

So... this was built by a random engineer on their personal machine, not the proper buildsystem. In fact, the [commit](https://android.googlesource.com/device/google/sunfish-kernel/+/f0e5311ad616d4c3c7a7d4580d330bb33a958cd4) of the binary kernel includes only the top-level artifacts, not any of the debug builds (kasan etc) or metadata.

Of course, there&amp;#39;s no source, so this is a GPL violation, but we knew that already.

But it&amp;#39;s even sadder than that. There&amp;#39;s lots of strings changes in the kernel that look like they updated some vendor subtrees, but there&amp;#39;s more.

Modules in the old kernel mention &amp;quot;.lto&amp;quot; depends, while in the new one they don&amp;#39;t. And the new kernel has more strings which were omitted from the old kernel. Did they compile the old kernel with LTO and the new one without?

There&amp;#39;s also a ton of lock names like these that got added:

```
+&amp;amp;c-&amp;gt;mutex
+&amp;amp;c_conn-&amp;gt;lock
+&amp;amp;c_conn-&amp;gt;mode_info_lock
```

As far as I know that&amp;#39;s lockdep... but I sure hope they didn&amp;#39;t compile the new kernel with lockdep enabled?

This is looking like a real hackjob.

The base device tree is unchanged, but the overlays change, and this is interesting:

```

+          google,cv-tier-ov-cnt = &amp;lt;0x01&amp;gt;;
+          google,cv-tier-switch-cnt = &amp;lt;0x03&amp;gt;;
+          google,chg-last-tier-vpack-tolerance = &amp;lt;0x1a13&amp;gt;;
+          google,chg-last-tier-dec-current = &amp;lt;0xc350&amp;gt;;
+          google,chg-last-tier-term-current = &amp;lt;0x324b0&amp;gt;;
+  };

```

So they lowered the max charge voltage from 4.44 V to 3.95 V. No duh the battery capacity went down the drain!

https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/f2OM6kEyPrhaWyuj.huge

According to a quick search, 3.87V nominal li-poly batteries have a max voltage of 4.45V or thereabouts, so the original setting was not wrong. But now they&amp;#39;re suddenly being *very* conservative.

There are three battery profiles, one for &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot;. Excluding that one, they are:

4197910_Google_S5_SWD_ATL_3080mAH_PM7150
4255777_Google_S5_SWD_LSN_3080mAH_PM7150

Only the &amp;quot;LSN&amp;quot; profile got the downgrade. &amp;quot;SWD&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;Sunwoda&amp;quot; (the manufacturer printed on the label). ATL is probably [this ATL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATL_(company)), and LSN is probably [Lishen](https://en.lishen.com.cn/), which are the manufacturers of the actual cells.

And then there&amp;#39;s that battery &amp;quot;debug&amp;quot; profile. Battery capacity goes down from 3080mAh to 1539mAh! Half! It says &amp;quot;debug&amp;quot; but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it&amp;#39;s not just &amp;quot;debug&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s the crippled profile.

I don&amp;#39;t know what the distribution of Pixel 4a batteries is, but if it&amp;#39;s two sources and anywhere near 50/50, it&amp;#39;s possible half of the phones in the wild got crippled.

You can tell which battery you have physically by the number next to the QR code. 8230015901 is ATL (good) and 8230020501 is LSN (bad). If you&amp;#39;re replacing your battery, make sure it&amp;#39;s ATL.</description>

From homeschooling while traveling to working remotely and sharing a home with three generations, I’ve learned life is too short not to create the path that suits me best.</description>

      <title>Lessons on Creative Work | Daniel Saewitz</title>
      <link>https://saewitz.com/lessons-on-creative-work</link>
      <description>These are lessons I learned while building my indie business, consulting, and pursuing creative work-but you may find some universality in your pursuits. They are my lessons, meaning they are not for everyone. They are not true to every situation, nor are they infallible. I&amp;#39;m writing them in the second tense, but they are written to me, about me. You will disagree with them and they may cut directly against your life situation. Take from them what you want to, and throw away the rest. I&amp;#39;ll try to keep it away from well-trodden territory.</description>

      <description>The recent release of DeepSeek-R1 made a pretty big splash, breaking into the mainstream news cycle in a way that the steady model releases we’ve had for a couple years now did not do. The main focuses of these stories were that 1. it was cheap and 2. it was chinese, forcing the market to reconsider some of it’s sky-high valuations of certain tech stocks. However, there are other interesting things to consider.</description>

      <description>About the tracking dots Most home and office printers add metadata to printed sheets in the form of very tiny yellow dots (sometimes called a machine identification code) that can’t be seen with the naked eye. The layout of the dots are different between printer brands and some don’t leave any at all. Information like serial number and sometime the print time is encoded in these dots. They can act as a “signature” for the printer that law enforcement uses as document forensic evidence (like in...</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;#39;m James! Join me to see one of the simplest ways to start breaking down a monolithic application, using events.

Learn how to use event-driven architecture to add new functionalities without impacting existing code. Understand the benefits of using tools like Dapr for event publishing and how to handle events with minimal changes to your monolithic system.
