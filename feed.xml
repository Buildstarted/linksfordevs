      <description>&amp;#39;Amazingly, ChatGPT gets hired at L3 when interviewed for a coding position,&amp;#39; reads a Google document, but ChatGPT itself says it can&amp;#39;t replicate human creativity and problem-solving skills.</description>

      <title>Contributing to open source projects and about learning zero-knowledge proofs</title>

      <description>I introduced kimchi in this blogpost last year. It&amp;#39;s the general-purpose zero-knowledge proof system that we will use in the next hardfork of Mina. We&amp;#39;ve been working on it continuously over the last two years to improve its features, performance, and usability.

Kimchi by itself is only a backend to create proofs. The whole picture includes:

      <title>What time is it? A simple question with a complex answer. How computers synchronize time</title>
      <link>https://andrea.corbellini.name/2023/01/23/what-time-is-it/</link>
      <description>Ever wondered how your computer or your phone displays the current date and
time accurately? What keeps all the devices in the world (and in space) in
agreement on what time it is? What makes applications that require precise
timing possible?</description>

      <title>2023-02-04 My accounting book is finished</title>
      <link>https://mbork.pl/2023-02-04_My_accounting_book_is_finished</link>
      <description>As I mentioned in my post about plans for 2023, I spent some time last two weeks on Personal accounting in Ledger, my booklet about, well, personal accounting in Ledger. It is now finished. Well, I say “finished” – a book is never “finished”. There is that joke that “finished software is like a mown lawn”, and it is quite fitting for books, too. In traditional publishing you couldn’t change an already published book, but with ebooks it is always possible to tinker here and there. This means that most probably, I will tinker with it a bit. Don’t worry, though – I do not plan to delete anything (only improve or add things), I definitely won’t do it too often – I have a lot of other things to do! – and I intend to mention any substantial changes in the release notes sent to readers who decide to receive emails about new editions.</description>

      <title>Design your pricing and tools so you can adapt them later - Arnon Shimoni</title>
      <link>https://arnon.dk/design-your-pricing-and-tools-so-you-can-adapt-it-later/</link>
      <description>In this blog post I’ll talk about three pricing architecture concepts that I think are really important in modern billing – designing pricing and packaging to be adaptable. I’ll build upon the experience our billing infrastructure team had at Pleo, which has allowed us to expand to new geographies, currencies, and adapt pricing very rapidly. […]</description>

      <title>A Linking Adventure - nsnotes</title>
      <link>https://nsnotes.github.io/2023/03/03/A-linking-adventure/</link>
      <description>Background
It occurred to me recently that I never hear of anyone linking their programs manually - meaning, running ld directly rather than through a wrapper utility like the gcc or clang drivers.
