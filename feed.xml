      <title>Building a Personal [Origami] Website in 2021</title>
      <link>https://origami.kosmulski.org/blog/2021-05-16-building-personal-origami-website-2021</link>
      <description>My new website       In early 2021, I rebuilt my website at origami.kosmulski.org from scratch. It was a complete redesign which started with planning what I wanted the site to be and who its intended audience was, followed by looking at a few potential technologies, checking them out and choosing one, building the site, and tuning its load times and SEO. While a few details are specific to origami, most are completely general and should be interesting to anyone planning to create their personal web page, regardless of topic.</description>

      <title>The True Size of Africa</title>
      <link>http://kai.sub.blue/en/africa.html</link>
      <description>A few years back there was an exhibition in a London gallery by the Royal Geographic Society, and the curator asked the edge.org group to contribute “unusual maps”.  Thinking it would be for a few hundred people at most, I put together a little map that I had made previously in the mid 80s before, then as an example of scientific visualization graphics software (which I spent a decade on, actually).</description>

      <title>Async/Await Calls Gotcha with the CSharp ? Null Propagator</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2021/May/15/Async-Await-with-the-Null-Propagator</link>
      <description>Null propagation in C# allows for short circuiting of void method calls, but when using result-less `await` async calls, this behavior works decidedly different, resulting in null exception runtime errors. While this behavior makes sense when you break down the command, it&amp;#39;s certainly not obvious. In this post I break down the how and why of the failure and how to work around it.</description>

      <description>Half a year ago, I joined Pleo, a FinTech startup with around 15,000 customers (we’re always hiring at Pleo!). I joined to take on and further develop the billing infrastructure. When I joined, I was actually a bit concerned about the narrowness of the new role and the new team. I mean, really… How much […]</description>
