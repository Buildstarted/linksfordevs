      <title>SonicDoor – Cracking SonicWall’s SMA 500 – SCRT Team Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.scrt.ch/2025/06/04/sonicdoor-attacking-sonicwalls-sma-500/</link>
      <description>While attempting to compare the security level of various VPN vendors, I kept falling down the path of searching for vulnerabilities instead. This blog post details the ones I discovered in SonicWall’s SMA 500, which were patched in December 2024. This post has been delayed to coincide with my talk at SecurityFest on this exact subject.</description>

      <title>Getting started with QT, without the nonsense</title>
      <link>https://sebastiano.tronto.net/blog/2025-04-04-qt-minimal/</link>
      <description>At work I have recently (yesterday) ended working on a big project and
I am now waiting for a new assignment. While I wait, I decided that I
should take some time to learn something that could be useful both at
work and for my personal projects.  After some thought, I settled on QT
development with C++.</description>

      <title>When the Assistant Becomes the Attacker: Hidden Risks of Tool-Enabled LLMs</title>
      <link>https://www.sakana.fr/blog/2025-06-08-llm-hidden-risks/</link>
      <description>LLMs aren’t just chatbots anymore. Once you give them tools, they stop suggesting and start acting. This piece explores the real—and often overlooked—risks of giving LLMs the ability to affect the world.</description>

      <title>No JS, No BS Ethical Web Analytics — Andrew Tropin</title>
      <link>https://trop.in/blog/no-js-no-bs-ethical-web-analytics</link>
      <description>I had two goals: to count AI crawlers DDoSing my nginx
infrastructure and to see if anybody reads at least one of my
three posts in the blog.  To achieve both, I needed to gather
data and transform it into meaningful insights, so basically I needed
web analytics.</description>

      <title>Focus and Context and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://taras.glek.net/posts/focus-and-context-and-llms/</link>
      <description>I decided to write down some thoughts on agentic coding and why it’s a very hyped wrong turn.
Let me start with some background on my LLM experience. I adopted LLMs into my work in Aug 2020. I was sold when I saw that GPT-3 could generate usable SQL statements. Something that used to take 4-8 hours of RTFMing, now took 15min. I have since worked on chatcraft.org, various RAG frameworks, etc. I use aider heavily for work, frequently switch models, have been struggling with tool calling during dark ages before MCP.</description>

      <title>Ditching HAProxy (in my homelab)</title>
      <link>https://arch.dog/bark/ditching-haproxy</link>
      <description>I'm always bothered by single points of failure. For my homelab, this quickly became a single HAProxy virtual machine. It existed on only one of my Proxmox instances (I can't replicate between them because the original instance doesn't use zfs. oops) so if the virtual machine or physical machine was unreachable for whatever reason, it effectively blocked my access to any service in my homelab Kubernetes cluster, and also broke communication between nodes and the Kubernetes API. It didn't happen often, and the fix was often trivial, but it still bothered me. Coupled with the fact that until recently the Kubernetes cluster also acted as a reverse proxy to services hosted on Proxmox and my NAS (read more about that stuff here), it could cause a wider outage than just what's on the cluster.</description>

      <title>The librarian immediately attempts to sell you a vuvuzela</title>
      <link>https://kaveland.no/posts/2025-06-06-library</link>
      <description>Imagine entering the biggest library in the world. You peer down an incredibly long aisle with wooden bookshelves brimming with books. You can see multiple such corridors, all lit with a comfortable warm light. There’s a rich smell of old paper. You can hear some muted voices, perhaps arguing in a whisper. It’s perfect, but vast and difficult to make sense of. Just this day, it doesn’t feel like such a terrible ordeal to just wander for a while, see where your legs take you. Maybe you’ll find something interesting completely by accident? The prospect is both exhilarating and daunting. The library appears endless, it feels like you could potentially find all sorts of exotic and interesting book collections.</description>

      <title>Will our next generation lose their own writing voice because of LLMs? | Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://andreagao.com/posts/next-generation-writing-voice/</link>
      <description>I loved writing a lot as a teenager and college student, since it was the easiest and most natural way to express myself and connect with others. Even now, years later, I can read my old writing and feel connected with my past self and derive something new from it.
I’ve been writing less in the last ten years because I’ve been busy with adulthood and juggling between English and Chinese. I used to write in Chinese, and now mostly write and communicate in English. However, I hadn’t given much thought to my own “writing voice” in either language till recently.</description>

      <description>On April 21st, the Bluesky team announced a new account verification system. In my opinion, one of the best bits about Bluesky was the ability to verify yourself using a domain name. This new system goes a step further, and I was curious about how it worked. This lead to me building a quick-and-dirty verifier listing tool.</description>
