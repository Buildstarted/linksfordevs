      <title>Dolphin Progress Report: February, March, and April 2023</title>
      <link>https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/05/21/dolphin-progress-report-february-march-april-2023/</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s been a hectic past few months for the project. In addition to the upcoming release on Steam, a lot of focus has gone into other major features. While not everything has landed yet, two very important changes to Android did arrive, one of which has been in the works for a couple years!
We&amp;#39;re talking about a large scale rewrite to Dolphin&amp;#39;s Android Input Handling that will eventually allow it to match the feature set users on Desktop Dolphin builds enjoy. Android users also get another major quality of life upgrade - Dolphin now is now a Document Provider on Android. This means you can use Dolphin to directly copy files into and out of its per-app directory on the latest versions of Android.
In this report, we&amp;#39;ll be going through both of these and several other important changes. Enjoy!</description>

      <title>Writing Python like it’s Rust</title>
      <link>https://kobzol.github.io/rust/python/2023/05/20/writing-python-like-its-rust.html</link>
      <description>I started programming in Rust several years ago, and it has gradually changed the way I design programs in other programming languages, most notably in Python. Before I started using Rust, I was usually writing Python code in a very dynamic and type-loose way, without type hints, passing and returning dictionaries everywhere, and occasionally falling back to “stringly-typed” interfaces. However, after experiencing the strictness of the Rust type system, and noticing all the problems that it prevents “by construction”, I suddenly became quite anxious whenever I got back to Python and wasn’t provided with the same guarantees.</description>

      <link>https://honza.pokorny.ca/2023/04/read-it-later-the-hard-way/</link>
      <description>There is a seemingly endless stream of articles we come across daily, and little time to read them. A quick glance at Hacker News in between tasks can yield half a dozen open tabs with articles to read at some point later. There are many services that help with this problem by maintaining a queue of these articles for you. You know the type: things like Instapaper or Pocket.
In this article, we will build a service like that.</description>

      <title>Boy Scouts’s bumbling CEOs cause inertia, leadership vacuum</title>

      <description>Summary Thanks to a defective career-advancement system and a promote-from-within culture, BSA&amp;#39;s CEO role is a reward for over-promoted, career-lifer, caretaker-style middle-managers. This starves BSA of leadership talent where it is most needed. The resulting leadership vacuum enables BSA&amp;#39;s rudder to be controlled by two hands: the hand of inertia and the hand of throw-back...</description>

      <title>Stop working for outsourcing companies as a software engineer</title>
      <link>https://olzhasar.github.io/posts/stop-working-for-outsourcing-companies/</link>
      <description>I’ve spent about three years in total working at two different outsourcing companies throughout my career. At my last such job, I led the back-end development of four different projects, made a decent amount of money and met lots of cool people. That’s pretty much it regarding the advantages. There are a lot more disadvantages than one can even imagine. I’ll try to break down the most critical.
Context switching They always tell that you are going to work on a single project at a time.</description>
