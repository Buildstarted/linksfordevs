      <title>Branches: No assembly required</title>
      <link>https://niedzejkob.p4.team/bootstrap/asmless/</link>
      <description>Last time, we started from the barebones Miniforth kernel, and
implemented branches by writing additional primitive words in assembly. For
pragmatic reasons, that is the road I will be pursuing further, but I noticed
that it is also possible to implement branches in pure Forth. I believe that
this approach is quite interesting, so let&amp;#39;s take a detour and get a closer
look. </description>

      <description> I’ve built a simple website analytics tool for this site, you can see it at /analytics. It has the following metrics: Page views per day, Unique IP addresses per day Views per page per day. Motivation Google Analytics Google Analytics felt like overkill. It has so many data-points that the useful metrics are obscured. I also like this site to load quickly and GA makes it slower. CloudFlare Analytics I’ve also tried CloudFlare Analytics.

You know, all the stuff that lives in .bashrc, .profile, .vimrc, .git, etc. As such, I decided to compile and publish a list of my favorite bash aliases and tools.</description>

      <title>A Journey into Mathematical Logic: Diophantus of Alexandria</title>
      <link>https://hegz.me/posts/diophantus/</link>
      <description>Introduction In this series of blog posts, I will be discussing some of my favorite topics in math, It mostly falls under the domains of mathematical logic and computability theory.
Diophantus of Alexandria Diophantus was a Greek mathematician that flourished around 250 AD, he is most famous for his book “Arithmetica” in which he had compiled 130 algebraic problems among thirteen books where most of their solutions were positive integers, and that’s why mathematicians call such algebraic equations as “Diophantine Equations”.</description>

      <description>I’ve been thinking about small things that can have a disproportionately large impact. For example, buying options against potential Black Swans. The cost of an option for an unlikely event occurring is generally small but if it happens, the upside can be huge. Conversely, you can have the opposite happen.

I speak to the rational below but I’ve finally arrived at something I’m happy with and it’d be great to begin getting some impressions / feedback from the wider community.   Redesigned Logo    This design is made up of all of the LLVM letters arranged into a wyvern dragon.    The logo performs well at small sizes without modification.

      <title>Let&amp;#39;s make Visual Studio even more accessible together.</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/lets-make-visual-studio-even-more-accessible-together/</link>
