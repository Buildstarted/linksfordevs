      <title>ASP.NET Core MVC Views not Resolving Partial Views outside of the default ControllerContext</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Aug/08/ASPNET-Core-MVC-Views-not-Resolving-when-Rendering-Partials-outside-of-the-default-ControllerContext</link>
      <description>I recently ran into a problem with ASP.NET Core MVC views where rendering a Parent View in a Controller Context other than the originally designed context won&amp;#39;t find Child Views that are referenced with no or local or relative paths. It turns out that ASP.NET Core MVC does not resolve local View paths as expected when rendering a View from a different ControllerContext instead using the current controller&amp;#39;s context paths, rather than the view relative paths. In this post I describe why this can be a problem and several ways to work around this problem.</description>

      <title>“Code” 2nd Edition Now Available!</title>
      <link>https://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2022/08/Code-2nd-Edition-Now-Available.html</link>
      <description>In a startling disruption of the space-time continuum — and a violation of the basic maxim of publishing that nothing is ever on time — the publication date of the 2nd edition of my book Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software was bumped up by 12 days. That means that the publication date is today and the book might be available from your favorite book vendor. (Or perhaps not quite yet.)</description>

      <title>#16: The case of fake IMDb credits</title>
      <link>https://peabee.substack.com/p/16-the-case-of-fake-imdb-credits</link>
      <description>I was casually browsing IMDb when I landed on the page for an upcoming Ranbir Kapoor starrer movie “Animal”. I saw the cast details and I found a face and a name I didn’t recognize. Finding out about this guy led me to a whole new world of how so many young Indian men from small towns are gaming the system to manufacture their own fake online clout.</description>

      <title>Why Putting Solar Canopies on Parking Lots Is a Smart Green Move</title>
      <link>https://e360.yale.edu/features/putting-solar-panels-atop-parking-lots-a-green-energy-solution</link>
      <description>Solar farms are proliferating on undeveloped land, often harming ecosystems. But placing solar canopies on large parking lots offers a host of advantages — making use of land that is already cleared, producing electricity close to those who need it, and even shading cars.</description>

      <title>Microdosing with psilocybin mushrooms: a double-blind placebo-controlled study - Translational Psychiatry</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-022-02039-0</link>
      <description>The use of low sub-perceptual doses of psychedelics (“microdosing”) has gained popularity in recent years. Although anecdotal reports claim multiple benefits associated with this practice, the lack of placebo-controlled studies severely limits our knowledge of microdosing and its effects. Moreover, research conducted in standard laboratory settings could fail to capture the motivation of individuals engaged or planning to engage in microdosing protocols, thus underestimating the likelihood of positive effects on creativity and cognitive function. We recruited 34 individuals starting to microdose with psilocybin mushrooms (Psilocybe cubensis), one of the materials most frequently used for this purpose. Following a double-blind placebo-controlled experimental design, we investigated the acute and short-term effects of 0.5 g of dried mushrooms on subjective experience, behavior, creativity (divergent and convergent thinking), perception, cognition, and brain activity. The reported acute effects were significantly more intense for the active dose compared to the placebo, but only for participants who correctly identified their experimental condition. These changes were accompanied by reduced EEG power in the theta band, together with preserved levels of Lempel-Ziv broadband signal complexity. For all other measurements there was no effect of microdosing except for few small changes towards cognitive impairment. According to our findings, low doses of psilocybin mushrooms can result in noticeable subjective effects and altered EEG rhythms, but without evidence to support enhanced well-being, creativity and cognitive function. We conclude that expectation underlies at least some of the anecdotal benefits attributed to microdosing with psilocybin mushrooms.</description>
