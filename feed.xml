      <title>Prime+Probe 1, JavaScript 0: Overcoming Browser-based Side-Channel Defenses</title>
      <link>https://orenlab.sise.bgu.ac.il/p/PP0</link>
      <description>Abstract The “eternal war in cache” has reached browsers, with multiple cache-based side-channel attacks and countermeasures being suggested. A common approach for countermeasures is to disable or restrict javaScript features deemed essential for carrying out attacks. A recent proposal following this approach is Chrome Zero, a browser add-on that intercepts and changes the semantics of some JavaScript features, while claiming minimal impact on user experience.</description>

Meanwhile, there are tools that you, the individual, can use to partially protect yourself against the forces of surveillance capitalism and other institutional privacy threats. I will share five that I use myself.</description>
