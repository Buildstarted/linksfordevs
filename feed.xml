      <title>As we work to protect public health, we also need to protect the income of hourly workers who support our campus - Microsoft on the Issues</title>
      <link>https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/03/05/covid-19-microsoft-hourly-workers/</link>
      <description>Microsoft has asked its employees who can work from home to do so due to the impact of COVID-19. Despite this meaning a reduced need for many of the hourly workers vital to our daily operations, we‚Äôve decided that Microsoft will continue to pay their regular pay during this period. We hope other large companies will take a similar approach to counteract the economic effect COVID-19 will have on hourly workers.</description>

      <title>Study Shows Low Carb Diet May Prevent, Reverse Age-Related Effects Within the Brain | | SBU News</title>
      <link>https://news.stonybrook.edu/newsroom/study-shows-low-carb-diet-may-prevent-reverse-age-related-effects-within-the-brain/</link>
      <description>The news in brief: 1) Brain changes associated with aging become visible much earlier than would be expected, in the late 40's. 2) This is hypothesized to result from neurons' loss of energy; if so, researchers may have found a way to prevent or reverse these effects. 3) This can be done with diet, by switching neurons' fuel from glucose to ketones. Ketones have previously been shown to increase the availability of energy to the heart. However, this is the first evidence that a similar benefit may be achieved for the brain. Study Shows Low Carb Diet May Prevent, Reverse Age-Related Effects Within the Brain STONY BROOK, NY, March 4, 2020 ‚Äì A study using neuroimaging led by Stony Brook University professor and lead author Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi, PhD, and published in PNAS, reveals that neurobiological changes associated with aging can be seen at a much younger age than would be expected, in the late 40s. However, the study also suggests that this process may be prevented or reversed</description>

      <title>SLIDE : In Defense of Smart Algorithms over Hardware Acceleration for Large-Scale Deep Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03129</link>
      <description>Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are the central focus of modern machine
learning systems. As data volumes keep growing, it has become customary to
train large neural networks with hundreds of millions of parameters to maintain
enough capacity to memorize these volumes and obtain state-of-the-art accuracy.
To get around the costly computations associated with large models and data,
the community is increasingly investing in specialized hardware for model
training. However, specialized hardware is expensive and hard to generalize to
a multitude of tasks. The progress on the algorithmic front has failed to
demonstrate a direct advantage over powerful hardware such as NVIDIA-V100 GPUs.
This paper provides an exception. We propose SLIDE (Sub-LInear Deep learning
Engine) that uniquely blends smart randomized algorithms, with multi-core
parallelism and workload optimization. Using just a CPU, SLIDE drastically
reduces the computations during both training and inference outperforming an
optimized implementation of Tensorflow (TF) on the best available GPU. Our
evaluations on industry-scale recommendation datasets, with large fully
connected architectures, show that training with SLIDE on a 44 core CPU is more
than 3.5 times (1 hour vs. 3.5 hours) faster than the same network trained
using TF on Tesla V100 at any given accuracy level. On the same CPU hardware,
SLIDE is over 10x faster than TF. We provide codes and scripts for
reproducibility.</description>
