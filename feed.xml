      <title>Onion, Hexagonal, Clean or Fractal Architecture? All of them, and more!!</title>
      <link>https://www.planetgeek.ch/2024/09/19/onion-hexagonal-clean-or-fractal-architecture-all-of-them-and-more/</link>
      <description>Onion, Hexagonal, Clean, or Fractal Architectures aim to organize how we deal with dependencies in our software architectures. But which one should we choose? After distilling the essence of each approach and comparing the advantages and challenges, I’ll show how to combine all of them into an approach to use evolutionary steps towards an architecture...</description>

      <title>TLA⁺ is more than a DSL for breadth-first search</title>
      <link>https://ahelwer.ca/post/2024-09-18-tla-bfs-dsl/</link>
      <description>Although it isn’t usually taught that way, a lot of TLA⁺ newcomers develop the understanding that TLA⁺ is just a fancy domain-specific language (DSL) for breadth-first search. If you want to model all possible executions of a concurrent system - so the thinking goes - all you have to do is define:
The set of variables modeling your system The values of those variables in the initial state(s) Possible actions changing those variables to generate successor states Safety invariants you want to be true in every state The model checker will then use breadth-first search (BFS) to churn through all possible states (&amp;amp; thus execution orders) of your system, validating your invariants.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models Are Real-Time Game Engines</title>
      <link>https://hlfshell.ai/posts/gamengen/</link>
      <description>Your browser does not support the video tag.  Google Deepmind recently released Diffusion Models Are Real-Time Game Engines [Site] | [Paper], a fascinating paper wherein a modified Stable Diffusion model acts as the game engine for the classic game of DOOM. Player actions are fed directly into the model (which they called GameNGen), which outputs a generated image of the next frame 20 times a second. The game state and display is entirely handled by the model itself.</description>

      <title>Surprising Scalability of Multitenancy - Marc&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://brooker.co.za/blog/2023/03/23/economics.html</link>
      <description>When most folks talk about the economics of cloud systems, their focus is on automatically scaling for long-term seasonality: changes on the order of days (fewer people buy things at night), weeks (fewer people visit the resort on weekdays), seasons, and holidays. Scaling for this kind of seasonality is useful and important, but there’s another factor that can be even more important and is often overlooked: short-term peak-to-average. Roughly speaking, the cost of a system scales with its (short-term1) peak traffic, but for most applications the value the system generates scales with the (long-term) average traffic.</description>

      <title>The self-hosted to DevOps engineer pipeline</title>
      <link>https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/the-self-hosted-to-devops-engineer-pipeline/</link>
      <description>What’s the best way to get a job? Show someone with a job to do that you can do the job within their iron triangle. What’s the best way you can show someone you can handle a complicated k8s deployment, with 7 different CNCF-approved add-ons, zero-downtime rollouts and a whole bunch of YAML files? Probably by competently and publicly running your own complicated k8s infrastructure.
Self-hosters remind me a lot of the sysadmins of yore, who mostly ended up in the profession because they just couldn’t help but mess around with their underlying computing machine until they knew all kinds of weird nooks and crannies within it.</description>

      <title>Is Tor still safe to use? | Tor Project</title>
      <link>https://blog.torproject.org/tor-is-still-safe/</link>
      <description>This blog post is a response to an investigative news report about a large-scale law-enforcement attack that managed to de-anonymize a user of an old version of the long-retired app Ricochet. This blog post aims to provide insight into what we know so far. Nothing that the Tor Project has learned about this incident suggests that Tor Browser was attacked or exploited. Tor users can continue to use Tor Browser to access the web securely and anonymously.</description>
