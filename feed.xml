      <link>https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?%2Farchives%2F929-One-Bad-Apple.html=</link>
      <description>My in-box has been flooded over the last few days about Apple&amp;#39;s CSAM announcement. Everyone seems to want my opinion since I&amp;#39;ve been deep into photo analysis technologies and the reporting of child exploitation materials. In this blog entry, I&amp;#39;m going to go over what Apple announced, existing technologies, and the impact to end users. Moreover, I&amp;#39;m going to call out some of Apple&amp;#39;s questionable claims.</description>

      <title>ongoing by Tim Bray &amp;#183; Apps Getting Worse</title>
      <link>https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/08/07/Apps-Get-Worse</link>
      <description>Too often, a popular consumer app unexpectedly gets worse: Some combination of harder to use, missing
    features, and slower.  At a time in history where software is significantly eating the world, this is nonsensical. It’s also
    damaging to the lives of the people who depend on these products.</description>

      <title>I closed a lot of browser tabs</title>
      <link>https://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/2126</link>
      <description>I am widely admired at work for my ability to have many, many browser tabs
open.  (That, at least, is what I take from the frequent shouts of &amp;quot;holy cow,
man, look at your browser!&amp;quot;)  Nonetheless, I have long thought that it would be
worth getting my total tab count down.  I have tabs open for a bunch of
reasons.</description>

      <title>Using Angular&amp;#39;s Base HREF in Paths  
</title>

      <description>I was recently working with a client and they were having an odd problem with Angular. They&amp;#39;d build their Angular apps in isolation then move them into an ASP.NET Core project and their asset links would break. Let&amp;#39;s look at why this happens and how to address it.
