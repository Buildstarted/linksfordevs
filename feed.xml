      <title>Don’t prefill config files</title>
      <link>https://www.makeworld.space/2024/02/no_prefill_config.html</link>
      <description>The biggest design mistake I made with Amfora, my first community open source project, was autogenerating config files. On startup, the application looks for a config file, and creates one if it doesn’t exist, full of all the application defaults. At the time, I thought this was great, as it documents all the existing options, and makes them very visible to the user in case they want to change them. In the end, this decision created a lot of headaches and is not something I’d ever do again.</description>

      <title>Trying to decode LEV-1 – Daniel Est&amp;#233;vez</title>
      <link>https://destevez.net/2024/01/trying-to-decode-lev-1/</link>
      <description>LEV-1 is a small lunar hopper that was carried by the SLIM lunar lander. It was released a few metres above the surface on January 19, as part of the lunar landing of SLIM. LEV-1 transmits telemetry in the 435 MHz amateur satellite band (it has an IARU satellite coordination approval), and also in S-band. Shortly after the landing, CAMRAS received the 437.410 MHz signal from LEV-1 using the 25 m radiotelescope at Dwingeloo. They have published a couple of IQ recordings in their directory of miscellaneous recordings (see the filenames starting by slim_).</description>

      <title>Introducing Juno for Apple Vision Pro</title>
      <link>https://christianselig.com/2024/02/introducing-juno/</link>
      <description>YouTube is probably one of the parts of the internet I consume the most, so I was more than a little sad when YouTube announced that they don’t have plans to build a visionOS app, and disabled the option to load the iPad app. This leaves you with Safari, and the website is okay, but definitely doesn’t feel like a visionOS app. Couple that with visionOS not having the option to add websites to your Home Screen, and YouTube isn’t that convenient on visionOS by default.</description>

      <title>WSL2 Backup to OneDrive Cloud</title>
      <link>https://tonym.us/wsl2-backup-to-onedrive-cloud.html</link>
      <description>WSL2 provides great disk performance, but it requires storing the files separately in a virtual disk that is not accessible by OneDrive. WSL2 can be backed up with wsl --export Debian to a VHD or TGZ, but that is a complete disk backup of 20gb or more -- not scalable for hourly backups.  With this approach, we use Windows Task Scheduler to trigger robocopy to incrementally sync directories from WSL2 to Onedrive&amp;#39;s native FS, so incremental copies are fast ( 1 s per 10k files), and OneDrive sync time remains negligible. It&amp;#39;s also useful for snapshotting subdirectories to TGZ for offline or …</description>
