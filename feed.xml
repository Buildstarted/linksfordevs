      <title>We Created A Fake Delivery Company</title>
      <link>https://blog.kashevko.com/we-created-a-fake-delivery-company-3/</link>
      <description>/imagine one day randomly finding yourself in a foreign country thousands of kilometres away from home. Your own country is suddenly at war, and all you have is a backpack hanging off your back.
That’s a weird situation to be in. But you have to figure something out.
So starting a fake delivery company sounds like the most reasonable solution.</description>

      <title>Franklin Pezzuti Dyer</title>
      <link>https://franklin.dyer.me/post/228</link>
      <description>Suppose you are tasked with designing a data structure consisting of values that can be compared with one another, and that this data structure must support two operations: insertion and lookup. At any moment, you may either be given a value and asked to insert it into your structure, or given a value and asked to say whether it is already present in your structure. The &amp;quot;computational complexity&amp;quot; of these two operations will be evaluated purely in terms of how many comparison operations they carry out on the provided data, so you don&amp;#39;t need to worry about memory complexity, time complexity, or anything like that. Think of this problem as being analogous to a balance puzzle.</description>

      <title>Chaos Engineering in Frontend Development: A Comprehensive Guide to Enhancing Application Resilience</title>
      <link>https://omid.dev/2024/07/01/chaos-engineering-in-frontend-development/</link>
      <description>In the dynamic world of web development, ensuring the resilience and reliability of frontend applications has become increasingly critical. As user expectations soar and application complexity grows, developers must adopt robust strategies to maintain high-quality, fault-tolerant systems. Enter Chaos Engineering – a discipline traditionally associated with backend systems and infrastructure, now making significant inroads into frontend development.
This comprehensive guide explores how applying Chaos Engineering principles to frontend applications can dramatically enhance their resilience, improve user experience, and help teams build more robust web applications.</description>

      <title>POSIX 2024 Changes</title>
      <link>https://sortix.org/blog/posix-2024/</link>
      <description>POSIX.1-2024 has just been released with a lot of exciting and interesting
improvements and removals compared to POSIX-1.2008. The html version of the
standard has not been uploaded yet as of this writing. The official list of new
functions in the standard itself is very incomplete, so I combed through the
CHANGE HISTORY sections in the official pdf, and I present you with the most
accurate list of the changes so far.</description>

      <title>Do a firmware update for your AirPods – now – Jonas’ Blog</title>
      <link>https://blogs.gnome.org/jdressler/2024/06/26/do-a-firmware-update-for-your-airpods-now/</link>
      <description>tldr: There’s a security vulnerability (CVE-2024-27867) in the firmware of Apple AirPods. Anyone who knows the Bluetooth MAC address (which is somewhat public) can connect to your AirPods and listen to the microphone or play music. Even while the AirPods are connected to your phone (although music would stop playing in case somebody turns on the microphone).</description>
