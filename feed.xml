      <title>Double-Odd Elliptic Curves - Double-Odd Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://doubleodd.group/</link>
      <description>Double-odd elliptic curves are a large subset of elliptic curves: these
are curves whose order is equal to 2 modulo 4 (i.e. the order is the
double of an odd integer). On top of double-odd elliptic curves, we can
define a prime order group suitable for building cryptographic
protocols. This is similar to what Ristretto
achieves for twisted Edwards curves, albeit with a different method.
Some highlights of double-odd elliptic curves are:</description>
