      <title>Microsoft Testing Platform CHANGES EVERYTHING for Your Tests!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=pYfT05L8C7o</link>
      <description>I honestly wasn't expecting changes for the way I've been writing tests for the last 100 years but... I was pleasantly surprised.

Looks like Microsoft Testing Platform is packing a PUNCH! Let's see what's introduced and what that means for your tests!

      <title>LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06120</link>
      <description>Large Language Models (LLMs) are conversational interfaces. As such, LLMs have the potential to assist their users not only when they can fully specify the task at hand, but also to help them define, explore, and refine what they need through multi-turn conversational exchange. Although analysis of LLM conversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in user instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn, fully-specified instruction setting. In this work, we perform large-scale simulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn settings. Our experiments confirm that all the top open- and closed-weight LLMs we test exhibit significantly lower performance in multi-turn conversations than single-turn, with an average drop of 39% across six generation tasks. Analysis of 200,000+ simulated conversations decomposes the performance degradation into two components: a minor loss in aptitude and a significant increase in unreliability. We find that LLMs often make assumptions in early turns and prematurely attempt to generate final solutions, on which they overly rely. In simpler terms, we discover that *when LLMs take a wrong turn in a conversation, they get lost and do not recover*.</description>

      <description>Dusk OS is a 32-bit Forth and big brother to Collapse OS. Its
primary purpose is to be maximally useful during the first
stage of civilizational collapse, that is, when we can't produce
modern computers anymore but that there's still many modern computers around.</description>

      <description>Junie is one of the best coding agent I've been trying out so far. Very well integrated with IntelliJ, great for Kotlin, and the test first focus makes it quite good at coming out with good results. However, I do miss the capability to only accept part of a solution and it can be very slowwwwww.</description>
