      <title>Understanding Cursor Pagination and Why It&amp;#39;s So Fast (Deep Dive)</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/understanding-cursor-pagination-and-why-its-so-fast-deep-dive</link>
      <description>While offset pagination is widely used, cursor-based pagination offers significant performance advantages - my tests show a 17x speedup when paginating through a million-record dataset in PostgreSQL. Let&amp;#39;s take a deep dive into cursor pagination, compare it with offset pagination, and examine the SQL execution plans.</description>

      <title>Emjay - a simple JIT that does math</title>
      <link>https://andreabergia.com/blog/2025/02/emjay-a-simple-jit-that-does-math/</link>
      <description>Today I wanna show off my most recent little project, called emjay. It’s a very simple “language”, with an evaluator that generates JIT code and executes it. It does not have a “normal” interpreter, only the JIT compiler. The language is extremely limited, but that was intentional, since I wanted something simple that I could write end-to-end. All the code is written in Rust and it is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/andreabergia/emjay. It’s roughly 4k lines of code including tests, so it is small enough to be presented in this post.</description>

      <description>Can an open-source MQTT broker handle one million messages per second for persistent sessions? TBMQ 2.x proves it can! Even more importantly, it achieves this with no single point of failure and ensures no data loss, even when hardware fails, making it a robust self-hosted MQTT broker solution for IIoT applications.

      <title>Why Is Everyone Obsessed With Chat Interfaces?</title>
      <link>https://zehfernandes.com/posts/why-is-everyone-obsessed-with-chat-interfaces</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about this: why does every app, tool, and platform seem to be adding a chat interface? I get it — chat is powerful. You can freely ask for something and get results fast. But as an interface designer, I can&amp;#39;t help but feel that products are forgetting an important lesson. It&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re just slapping a chat box onto everything and calling it a day. And honestly, that feels off.</description>

      <title>What Would Surprise You? | Centauri Dreams</title>
      <link>https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2025/02/14/what-would-surprise-you/</link>
      <description>Someone asked me the other day what it would take to surprise me. In other words, given the deluge of data coming in from all kinds of observatories, what one bit of news would set me back on my heels? That took some reflection. Would it surprise me, my interlocutor persisted, if SETI fails to find another civilization in my lifetime?</description>

Discover how to build a robust webhook processing system that scales effortlessly with your growing business needs. In this video, we will implement a queue-based architecture that transforms webhook handling from a potential bottleneck into a scalable solution.

By publishing incoming webhooks as messages to a queue, you gain the flexibility to distribute processing across multiple consumers, effectively managing high loads and ensuring reliable delivery. Learn how this architecture prevents system overload and provides the foundation for a resilient webhook infrastructure that grows with your application.

      <description>Ever wished you could store semi-structured data in your database without dealing with complex table relationships? Good news! SQL Server has native JSON support, and EF Core makes working with JSON columns easier than ever. Whether you’re handling dynamic configurations, logging data, or flexible user preferences, JSON columns let you mix structured and unstructured data in SQL Server—without creating dozens of extra tables.</description>

      <link>https://search.technomancy.us/why</link>
      <description>Did you learn to use the Internet in the 90s like me? There&amp;#39;s a
    lot of nostalgia around those simpler times before the Web had
    been colonized by companies. Some of it is valid and some is
    seen thru rose-colored glasses, but anyone who was there at the
    time can attest to the fact that it was hard to find
    stuff. The web was wild, weird, and deeply chaotic. But then
    I remember back in 2002 or 2003 the feeling of discovering Google
    and realizing I could stop bouncing around search engines, because
    this one was better than all the others. I would guess that you,
    dear reader, either had a similar realization, or that you started
    using the Web after the rise of Google and may have had trouble
