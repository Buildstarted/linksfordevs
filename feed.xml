      <title>Web color is still broken</title>
      <link>https://webcolorisstillbroken.com/</link>
      <description>Almost all colors on the web (from the data in your average PNG file to hex values in CSS and SVG) are represented not as actual color intensities, but using a lossy compression algorithm called &amp;quot;8-bit sRGB&amp;quot;. Most people call this a &amp;quot;color space&amp;quot;, but its primary purpose is to represent color data in fewer bits than would be required for decent quality if you were storing actual, numerical brightness values corresponding to light intensity. Therefore, it is more useful to think of it as a lossy compression technology.</description>

      <link>https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2022/04/20/rngd/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been using my Raspberry Pis for some data collection purposes, and 
noticed some of them doing a few things which seemed suboptimal.  
There&amp;#39;s this process called &amp;quot;rngd&amp;quot; which really likes to wake up every 
so often and announce stuff about what it&amp;#39;s been up to.  It&amp;#39;s usually 
about every hour, and it tends to push a dozen lines to the syslog, none 
of which I care about.</description>
