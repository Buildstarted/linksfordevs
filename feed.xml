      <title>No raw data, no science: another possible source of the reproducibility crisis</title>
      <link>https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-0552-2</link>
      <description>A reproducibility crisis is a situation where many scientific studies cannot be reproduced. Inappropriate practices of science, such as HARKing, p-hacking, and selective reporting of positive results, have been suggested as causes of irreproducibility. In this editorial, I propose that a lack of raw data or data fabrication is another possible cause of irreproducibility. As an Editor-in-Chief of Molecular Brain, I have handled 180 manuscripts since early 2017 and have made 41 editorial decisions categorized as “Revise before review,” requesting that the authors provide raw data. Surprisingly, among those 41 manuscripts, 21 were withdrawn without providing raw data, indicating that requiring raw data drove away more than half of the manuscripts. I rejected 19 out of the remaining 20 manuscripts because of insufficient raw data. Thus, more than 97% of the 41 manuscripts did not present the raw data supporting their results when requested by an editor, suggesting a possibility that the raw data did not exist from the beginning, at least in some portions of these cases. Considering that any scientific study should be based on raw data, and that data storage space should no longer be a challenge, journals, in principle, should try to have their authors publicize raw data in a public database or journal site upon the publication of the paper to increase reproducibility of the published results and to increase public trust in science.</description>

      <title>Announcing TypeScript 3.8 | TypeScript</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8/</link>
      <description>Today we’re proud to release TypeScript 3.8!
For those unfamiliar with TypeScript, it’s a language that adds syntax for types on top of JavaScript which can be analyzed through a process called static type-checking. This type-checking can tell us about errors like typos and values that are potentially null and undefined before we even run our code.</description>

      <title>Null API Responses and HTTP 204 Results in ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Feb/24/Null-API-Responses-and-HTTP-204-Results-in-ASPNET-Core</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core's default API handlers return an HTTP 204 response for null value results. This is meant to be a convenience feature, but if your calling API depends on a proper JSON response or an HTTP 200 result code, it can cause applications to break. In this post I'll describe why this can be a problem and how you can return proper JSON results for null values.</description>

      <title>10K Request per Second: REST API with Azure SQL, Dapper and JSON</title>

      <description>In the previous article I described how easy is to create a REST API with Python and Azure SQL. But what about .NET? Would that be as easy as well? Absolutely yes: the native support to JSON offered by Azure SQL will also help a lot again. In addition to that, the Micro-ORM Dapper will make the inte...</description>

      <description>"2020 is the start of a new decade – or does it start in 2021?" That was the debate on social media as we crossed over into the new year.

      <title>On Voice Coding</title>
      <link>https://dusty.phillips.codes/2020/02/15/on-voice-coding/</link>
      <description>I have had repetitive stress injury (RSI) flareups on and off for many years. I’ve kept them under control mostly through use of an Kinesis Advantage ergonomic keyboard that I’ve had for fifteen years. However, several months ago, I was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and instructed to avoid typing if at all possible.
I make my living programming and writing. My hobbies are programming and writing.
The first thing I had to do was completely scrap two book projects.</description>
