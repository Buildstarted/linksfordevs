      <title>Kill your Feeds - Stop letting algorithms dictate how you think</title>
      <link>https://usher.dev/posts/2025-03-08-kill-your-feeds/</link>
      <description>We are being boiled like frogs. It happened gradually, one algorithmic tweak at a time. What started as a way to connect with friends has become a system that gives the corporations that run social media control over what we consume and the ability to subtly shape how we think.</description>

      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/better-request-tracing-with-user-context-in-asp-net-core</link>
      <description>Adding user context to request tracing in ASP.NET Core helps track issues and understand user behavior. This article shows how to implement middleware that enriches logs with user IDs for better troubleshooting and performance monitoring.</description>

      <title>Threat modeling: PhaaS, platform abuses, and content moderation</title>
      <link>https://gubello.me/blog/threat-model-phaas-platform-abuses/</link>
      <description> ❗️Disclosure: I work at Pitch since December 2021. This write-up aggregates public knowledge previously shared by third parties (e.g., security firms, infosec community, etc.) or us. I hope this can be helpful for younger security teams that need to understand how to identify and mitigate phishing abuses for the first time.
Threat model When you work in the startup ecosystem long enough, you learn that company cybersecurity risks are not only related to IT failures or the OWASP Top 10 but also to reputation. It doesn’t matter if your infrastructure is solid and redundant, if your engineers follow best practices, if you have real-time monitors and alerts in place, or if you implement other good practices: if stakeholders don’t trust your security standards, you are not secure in their eyes. This is why startups and companies invest money and time into security certifications like ISO 27001 or SOC 2 Type 2 (though this is a controversial topic, and I have strong opinions on it, I won’t delve into that now).</description>

      <title>Multi-Agents Are Out, PID Controllers Are In</title>
      <link>https://timkellogg.me/blog/2025/03/06/pid-controllers</link>
      <description>My hottest take is that multi-agents are a broken concept and should be avoided at all cost. My only caveat is PID controllers; A multi agent system that does a 3-step process that looks something like **Plan, Act, Verify** in a loop. That can work. Everything else is a devious plan to sell dev tools.</description>
