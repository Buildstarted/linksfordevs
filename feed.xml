      <link>http://paulgraham.com/worked.html</link>
      <description>Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,
were writing and programming. I didn&amp;#39;t write essays. I wrote what

are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,
just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them
deep.</description>

Don Marti, Rick Moen (yes he was

Since at the Linux tea party, microsoft showed up at
our meeting point to try to deter us from going to their offices in Palo Alto,

it at the last minute to the crowd that had gathered, as planned, at the four
meeting points around the Bay Area.</description>
