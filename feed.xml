      <title>Simple Cluster Monitoring with Munin</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2021/simple_cluster_monitoring/</link>
      <description>If you have more than one server to administrate, chances are you will
benefit from having at least a rudimentary form of monitoring in place.
Having access to usage statistics, thermal sensors, and the like will
make your life immensely easier in the long run. When Max
and I started working on the compute cluster of our lab in earnest, we
wanted a lightweight monitoring solution that would be easy to set up,
leaving us room to grow. After evaluating existing solutions, I decided
to go with Munin, a lightweight
server–client set of monitoring plugins. These notes provide some
details about how to set it up and easily gain access to warnings.</description>

      <description>Suppose you are a pedestrian about to cross the street. A car approaches the crosswalk and the driver sees you. You think he will let you go first. Instead, he stops for a fraction of a second and does not give you a chance. You flip him the bird, that guy must be an inconsiderate…</description>

      <title>Be more productive with use of your BASH history &amp;#183; cyb.org.uk</title>
      <link>https://cyb.org.uk/2021/05/03/bash-productivity.html</link>
      <description>If you spend time working in the terminal, whether for work or leisure, a lot
of the commands you type often have a dependency on other recent commands, 
might be repetitive actions, or be very similar to other commands previously
run. Gaining mastery over your shell history is a great way to be more
productive in the terminal.</description>

      <title>Building a Personal [Origami] Website in 2021</title>
      <link>https://origami.kosmulski.org/blog/2021-05-16-building-personal-origami-website-2021</link>
      <description>My new website       In early 2021, I rebuilt my website at origami.kosmulski.org from scratch. It was a complete redesign which started with planning what I wanted the site to be and who its intended audience was, followed by looking at a few potential technologies, checking them out and choosing one, building the site, and tuning its load times and SEO. While a few details are specific to origami, most are completely general and should be interesting to anyone planning to create their personal web page, regardless of topic.</description>

      <title>The True Size of Africa</title>
      <link>http://kai.sub.blue/en/africa.html</link>
      <description>A few years back there was an exhibition in a London gallery by the Royal Geographic Society, and the curator asked the edge.org group to contribute “unusual maps”.  Thinking it would be for a few hundred people at most, I put together a little map that I had made previously in the mid 80s before, then as an example of scientific visualization graphics software (which I spent a decade on, actually).</description>
