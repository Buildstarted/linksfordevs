      <title>Cleipnir and Beyond: On Resilient Development Practices with Thomas Sylvest</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=GDgSbcOFsdY</link>
      <description>RJJ Software&amp;#39;s Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software&amp;#39;s Podcasting Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.

 Show Notes &amp;quot;So part of what Resilient Programming is about and what the framework does is that it kind of like tries to provide a nice abstraction, a developer-friendly abstraction for implementing distributed systems.&amp;quot;— Thomas Sylvest

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focussing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie &amp;quot;GaProgMan&amp;quot; Taylor.

 In this episode, Thomas Sylvest joined us to talk about both Resilient Programming and Cleipnir .NET - a framework that Thomas worked on to implement the concepts of Resilient Programming in .NET applications. Cleipnir, and Resilient Programming, are fantastic for supporting message-driven architectures; whether you&amp;#39;ve built a monolith, series of microservices, or anything in between.

 &amp;quot;But the idea is the same, kind of like that you try and remember the result of actions that you&amp;#39;ve done in a way that if you then start again, you won&amp;#39;t... you kind of like you&amp;#39;ll check in your little notebook if you already performed this action. If you did then you&amp;#39;ll just return the result of the previous execution. If you look in your in your notebook and you can see, &amp;#39;okay actually I haven&amp;#39;t done this before&amp;#39; you will then perform the action&amp;quot;— Thomas Sylvest

 Anyway, without further ado, let&amp;#39;s sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we&amp;#39;ll dive into the core of Modern .NET.

      <title>How I used .NET 9 and AI to charge my electric car</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=SGSBZhbIX2E</link>
      <description>Can you use .NET 9 to charge your electric car using solar power? Absolutely! In this session, Johnny will show you how to leverage your development skills and .NET 9 to combine data from external vendors by using their API&amp;#39;s and be smart with that data to command your electric vehicle to charge when the time is right. Johnny even added some AI to the mix to be able to ask questions about the current charging state using Azure OpenAI for the LLM, Semantic Kernel to create a custom copilot, and Azure Cognitive Services for Speech-To-Text. This demo is not something that is put together for this talk, it is a cloud-native distributed application used by Johnny on a day-to-day basis.

      <title>Getting Started with Docker for .NET Web Apps</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=Fifjvgu6C_c</link>
      <description>I want to show you how to get started with Docker for .NET Web Apps. I will create a Blazor Server web application and add Docker support directly from Visual Studio.

I will also show you how to achieve the same using the command-line interface.

In the end, you&amp;#39;ll be able to run and debug a .NET web app from inside a Docker container running on your developer machine.
