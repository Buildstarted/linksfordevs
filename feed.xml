      <description>It’s no secret that JetBrains Rider is my IDE of choice. The JetBrains team’s ability to stay current with language additions has helped me keep my C# knowledge relevant in a fast-paced world. It’s always exciting to see refactoring recommendations, and while it’s easy to hit Alt+Enter, I like to understand why I’m about to apply a change.</description>

      <title>Inject a service into a System.Text.Json converter</title>
      <link>https://thomaslevesque.com/2020/08/31/inject-service-into-system-text-json-converter/</link>
      <description>Most JSON converters are fairly simple, and typically self-contained. But once in a while, you need to do something a little more complex in a converter, and you end up needing to call a service. However, there’s no built-in dependency injection in System.Text.Json converters… How can you access the service you need?
There are basically two variants of this problem. One has a simple solution, the other is a bit of a hack…</description>

      <title>Zen and Development | Potemkin Life</title>
      <link>https://potemkinlife.com/zen/</link>
      <description>Good software engineers are rare. There are many reasons as to why. The most obvious reason is that to become a good software developer one has to master many skills (language proficiency, documentation literacy, debugging, text editing, architecture, and design, etc, etc). Because these are the obvious barriers to becoming good, there is an abundance of advice out there for young engineers on how to hone their skills. Most of this advice is either uninteresting, inefficient, or both. Why? Because the process of mastering a skill is typically independent of the skill being mastered. The process is almost always as simple as: learn (read technical material), practice (daily), have patience.</description>
