      <title>Be the LetsEncrypt in your homelab with step-ca</title>
      <link>https://jan.wildeboer.net/2025/07/letsencrypt-homelab-stepca/</link>
      <description>So you have a Cute Homelab and you want to use it to secure your services and containers with x509 certificates? But your homelab isn‚Äôt on the internet, so you can‚Äôt simply use LetsEncrypt? Well. You can become your own LetsEncrypt and hand out certificates with certbot. You ‚Äújust‚Äù need to run your own CA (Certificate Authority). Sounds frightening and complicated? It kinda is, but not really when you use step-ca, an open source solution that you can run in a container.</description>

      <description>By now, you likely already have seen someone online lament the loss of forums. Forums used to be the best places online, and then Reddit/Twitter/social media happened, and then it got worse with Discord. That‚Äôs the narrative anyway. In reality, nothing ever happens for no reason whatsoever online, and trying to assume such comes off like a bizarre perversion of history in the vein of Idiocracy‚Äôs Time Machine:</description>

      <description>The Khronos Group recently released a set of provisitional extensions adding video encoding and decoding capabilities to the Vulkan API, collectively referred to as Vulkan Video. This thus seemed like the perfect opportunity to provide an introduction to video compression from the perspective of a graphics programmer, and discuss why having integrated support for video encoding and decoding as part of the Vulkan API is an important step forward for the industry.</description>

      <description>I just received an email from Google stating that they are no longer it's going to support the Nest 1st gen and 2nd gen thermostats. While they will continue to operate locally, it appears that they will no longer work with the Nest app or Home app controls. I currently use the Nest app to control the thermostats, but does this mean that we won't even be able to control the thermostats via a Hubitat integration?  Cheers,  Simon</description>

      <link>https://blog.julik.nl/2025/09/driving-by-hand</link>
      <description>On the 30th of August, 2000, a train flew out of the tunnel at a station in Paris, and, without stopping, rolled on through into the tunnel. It was clear that the train was speeding, and speeding severely. Inside the tunnel, the train has derailed with the front cab car turning over. Luckily, there were no fatalities. 24 people were injured. The investigation was able to establish that the train‚Äôs speed was above the maximum permitted on that section of track by 20 km/h, if not more. How could this happen, given that the Paris Metro has been equipped with automatic speed control since the early 70s?</description>

      <title>What to do with an old iPad</title>
      <link>http://odb.ar/blog/2025/09/05/hosting-my-blog-on-an-iPad-2.html</link>
      <description>I recently inherited my parents‚Äô old iPad 2. It had iOS 9 on it and was barely usable, in part due to how slow it was but mostly because of old SSL certificates and apps stopping support. But I wanted to give it some life because I hate to see a working machine go to waste. So I asked around and got a great answer: The iPad 2 can be downgraded to iOS 6.1.3 or 8.4.1. Both offer better performance than iOS 9 and have untethered jailbreaks. Once downgraded and jailbroken you can sideload hours and hours worth of games. A lot from that era are IAP-free.</description>
