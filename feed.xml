      <title>App Service Managed Certificate (Preview) Now Supports Apex Domains</title>
      <link>https://azure.github.io/AppService/2021/03/02/asmc-apex-domain.html</link>
      <description>App Service Managed Certificate (preview) now lets you secure your apex domains on your web apps at no additional charge. This feature is similar to the current App Service Managed Certificate sub-domain support where you can create a standard certificate valid for six months which will automatically renew a month prior expiration. Your TLS/SSL bindings will also be automatically updated. If you have several domains, you will need to separately create an App Service Managed Certificate for each of them; wildcard certificate is not supported for this feature.</description>

      <description>Many of us want to learn a foreign language, understand its literature, be capable of speaking it, etc., but it&amp;#39;s damn boring to spend time learning grammar and memorizing words. After all, that&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;re taught in schools, and we know from our experience that learning is supposed to be boring.</description>

      <description>You’ve heard about NFTs. You’ve heard about Bitcoin using up as much electricity as Argentina. You might’ve seen some comparisons claiming a particular NFT cost who knows how much electricity. You’re worried. Someone might’ve even mentioned “Proof of Stake” as a solution but then someone else might’ve called it “vaporwave”, leaving you worried still. Let’s address that.</description>

      <description>For many computational biologists, their work starts with sequencing data. But that data obviously doesn’t appear out of nowhere. To bring that side of molecular biology a bit closer to home, I got my hands on an old flow cell and take it apart to see what it’s made of.</description>

      <link>https://fzakaria.com/2021/03/13/jruby-and-sorbet.html</link>
      <description>A recent tweet by the JRuby folks, let me know that the work I had done a while ago to get Sorbet working seemed to have gone under the radar. Sorbet is a fast, powerful type checker designed for Ruby. I wanted to reflect on it’s use at our current codebase, challenges still faced and where to go next. If you want to cut ahead and start using Sorbet right away, I’ve contributed some documentation.</description>
