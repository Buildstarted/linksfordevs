      <title>A Quest to Find a Highly Compressed Emoji :shortcode: Lookup Function</title>
      <link>https://prilik.com/blog/post/emoji-shortcodes/</link>
      <description>Have you ever wondered what&amp;amp;rsquo;s the smallest amount of static storage (code + data) needed to map emoji :shortcodes: to emoji?
Probably not&amp;amp;hellip; but now that I&amp;amp;rsquo;ve posed the question, aren&amp;amp;rsquo;t you at least a little curious what the answer might be?
So hey, if you&amp;amp;rsquo;ve got some time to spare, why not stick around a while and learn a bit about cool topics such as perfect hashing, probabilistic data structures, and 2D dynamic programming algorithms?
Take a break from solving whatever &amp;amp;ldquo;important problem&amp;amp;rdquo; you&amp;amp;rsquo;re working on, kick back, relax, and join me on my [somewhat useless] quest to find a highly compressed emoji :shortcode: lookup function!
 Thanks to the power of WebAssembly, you can play with the final result right from your browser!
&amp;amp;mdash;-&amp;amp;gt; Check out the online demo! &amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;mdash;&amp;amp;ndash;

      <description>People bash OO a lot these days, I&amp;#39;m increasingly coming to the opinion they&amp;#39;re right, at least in Python. My point here is not to argue that OO is bad per se, more that its introduction is simply unnecessary, AKA not useful.</description>

      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip303.html</link>
      <description>When you need to manually build and deploy your app, each time that you make a change, you will make mistakes, which result in bugs and downtime for users. Automating your build and deployment processes makes them less error-prone and allows you to deploy as often as you want. GitHub Actions (opens new window) can help to automate your builds and deployments and integrates with Azure App Service (opens new window).</description>

A few weeks ago Anna (4y) wanted to play with some packing material. It looked very messy to me, I didn&amp;#39;t expect she would clean it up, and I didn&amp;#39;t want to fight with her about cleaning it up. I considered saying no, but after thinking about how</description>

      <link>https://www.codeart.dk/blog/2021/1/adhering-to-consent-with-cookie-information-for-episerver/</link>
      <description>In the EU the past year has added even more rules and regulations to which cookies can be set, which data can be collected and which consents are needed for it. While it may not be tricky to add a basic consent box, adding one that adhere to all the proper legislation and then follow the consents given can be a bit more challenging.
