      <title>From Code to Cloud in 15 Minutes: Jason Taylor's Expert Insights And The Clean Architecture Template</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=Zdi4rM32t1I</link>
      <description>RJJ Software's Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software's Podcasting Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.

 Show Notes "So I've been focused on the code to cloud journey, I like to call it, for the template. And two years ago, my goal was to provide a solution that could take you from code to cloud in 45 minutes or less. So I wanted it to be "file new project" to deploy a solution on Azureâ€”because that's where my main focus isâ€”within 45 minutes."â€” Jason Taylor

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie "GaProgMan" Taylor.

 In this episode, Jason Taylor (no relation) joined us to talk about his journey from Classic ASP to .NET and Azure. He also discusses clean architectureâ€™s maintainability, and his open-source Clean Architecture Solution template for ASP .NET Core, along with strategies for learning new frameworks and dealing with complexity.

 "Right now the template supports PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server. If you want to support MySQL, it's relatively easy to do because there's already a Bicep module or a Terraform module that you can go in and use it. So I went from 45 minutes to now I can get things up and running in like, I don't know, two minutes of effort and 15 minutes of waiting around while I make my coffee"â€” Jason Taylor

 Along the way, we talk about some of the complexities involved with creating a template which supports multiple different frontend technologies and .NET Aspire (which was news to me when we recorded), all the while maintaining the goal of being the simplest approach for enterprise development with Clean Architecture.

 Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.

      <description>OSINT used to be a thinking game. Now itâ€™s becoming a trusting game and that should terrify you.Iâ€™ve seen it firsthand, analysts running solid investigations, then slowly shifting more and more of the thinking to GenAI tools. At first, itâ€™s small. You use ChatGPT to summarise a document or translate a foreign post. Then itâ€™s helping draft your reports. Then itâ€™s generating leads. And eventually, youâ€™re not thinking as critically as you used to. Youâ€™re verifying less, questioning less, relying mo</description>

      <title>The Easiest Way to Meditate</title>
      <link>https://shubhamjain.co/2025/04/03/easiest-form-of-meditation/</link>
      <description>
Meditation is great â€” most of us can agree on that. But like exercise, itâ€™s been overcomplicated. There are just so many forms of it: guided, silent, body scans, vipassana, kriyas. There are apps, videos, retreats, books, and self-proclaimed gurusâ€”everyoneâ€™s selling their version.

Its benefits have also been oversold. People are led to believe itâ€™s a one-stop solution for all mental health issues, and at worst, a path to everlasting bliss. Do a week of Vipassana and your mind will be permanently transformed.

I canâ€™t speak for everyone, but that hasnâ€™t been my experience.

Meditation, to me, is just a tool to denoise the brain â€” and thatâ€™s become crucial in an age of constant overstimulation. Denoising helps you tune into the present, improves your focus, helps you identify the negative thought patterns, and also, softens their grip.

## Transcendental Meditation

Once I reframed what meditationÂ *is*â€”a tool to denoise the brainâ€”I had much more realistic expectations. After experimenting with various techniques, I found one that fits perfectly: Transcendental Meditation.

Don't worry, the name makes it sound advanced, but itâ€™s actually the simplest one Iâ€™ve tried.

That said, itâ€™s promoted by an organization that is borderline scammy (trying too hard to sell something), so good info is weirdly hard to find without paying. But the technique itself? Surprisingly easy and effective.

Here's how to do it:

**Just close your eyes and repeat a simple word or mantra &lt;u&gt;in your mind&lt;/u&gt; (like, _om_, _shrim_, or _namah_). It should be pleasant sounding and ideally meaningless. Donâ€™t try to control your thoughts. If your mind drifts, gently return to repeating the mantra.**

Thatâ€™s it. Sit on a chair, sit cross-legged, or lie down, doesnâ€™t matter. Set a timer for 15â€“20 minutes, or go by feel. Do it in a park, or at home; in the morning, evening, or at night.

â€‹Everything is up to you. 

## Why it works?

Like I said earlier, meditation is just a way to denoise your brain. Whether you focus on your breath, your body, or a mantra â€” itâ€™s all aiming for the same outcome.

Repeating a word in your head is especially effective because, oddly enough, **the mind can only focus on one thing at a time**. When you repeat the word, it gently cuts off wandering thoughts. Over time, this starts to clear the mental clutter. Your mind calms down and you become more in tune with the present, and your own thought patterns.

When I practice it, I feel less overwhelmed, more focused, and the urge to doomscroll quiets down. And at night, itâ€™s incredibly helpful for falling asleep.

If meditation is supposed to be a path to everlasting bliss, then Iâ€™m probably not on it â€” and honestly, thatâ€™s okay.

---

People have claimed all sorts of things about meditation, but in my experience, it's not necessary to explore the depth of consciousness to be reasonably happy. Itâ€™s healthier to approach meditation with more grounded expectations. 

But that's my take.  If you want to transform your mind, you're better off exploring a retreat or something similar.

      <title>A case against migration files</title>

      <title>Everyone Wants to Be a Ghibli Character. So, Why Does It Feel So Wrong?</title>
      <link>https://samsimlai.github.io/ghibli-ai-trend</link>
      <description>Thereâ€™s a peculiar kind of magic in watching Studio Ghibli films. The kind that doesnâ€™t just entertain â€” it lingers. It coats your soul like the afternoon light in My Neighbor Totoro, or the silent resilience of Princess Mononoke. It makes you want to touch grass, sip tea slowly, notice the wind, and wonder why we ever stopped paying attention to these things in the first place.</description>

      <title>How to Make Your Neural Network Run Faster: An Overview of Optimization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arikpoz.github.io/posts/2025-03-30-how-to-make-your-neural-network-run-faster-an-overview-of-optimization-techniques/</link>
      <description>Introduction Neural networks are becoming increasingly powerful, but speed remains a crucial factor in real-world applications. Whether youâ€™re running models on the cloud, edge devices, or personal hardware, optimizing them for speed can lead to faster inference, lower latency, and reduced resource consumption.
In this post, weâ€™ll explore various techniques to accelerate neural networks, from model compression to hardware optimizations. This will serve as a foundation for future deep dives into each method.</description>
