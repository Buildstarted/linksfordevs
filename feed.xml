      <title>Two Actually Useful GPT-3.5 Prompts for Zettelkasten Schreibers</title>
      <link>https://www.bramadams.dev/202302181117/</link>
      <description>I have been using two GPT-3.5 prompts to help me save time and improve my writing as a Zettelkasten Schreiber. The Outline to Complete Sentence English Prompt transforms outlines into complete sentence English, while the Summary Generator takes complex text and distills it into a blurb.</description>

      <title>FOSS communities: You don’t need to yell</title>
      <link>https://www.akselmo.dev/2023/02/17/You-dont-need-to-yell.html</link>
      <description>This is kind of open letter I suppose. I’ve seen a lot of similar stuff happen in other projects too, like GNOME. So I wanted to write down what happened to me and my inbox today. It’s written in my perspective, but I’m sure many can sympathize. And I sympathize with them.</description>

      <title>Queues should be empty</title>
      <link>http://joshvoigts.com/articles/queues-should-be-empty/</link>
      <description>I’ve been writing a pubsub listener for work recently and had this silly “shower thought”: the ideal queue should be empty. Why? If the queue is not empty, it means that whatever job is consuming from the queue is not keeping up with messages coming into it. Ok, then if queues are supposed to be empty, then what are they good for?</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I bought a set of pentominos because it reminded me of a book I had read as a child: The Wright 3. I solved a few configurations but soon my computer scientist education and my laziness took over and whispered: exact cover. If you are looking for a set cover solver, simply use from malib import exact_cover.</description>

      <description>The Microsoft Authenticator app helps you sign in to your accounts when you&amp;#39;re using two-step verification. Two-step verification helps you to use your accounts more securely because passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised. Two-step verification uses a second step like your phone to make it harder for other people to break in to your account. You can use the Authenticator app in multiple ways:</description>

      <description>1.  beginnings
There were many motivations to start Mini FM, but as a matter of  fact, Mini FM started in my seminar to cheer up my students who were isolated each other in the period between the collapse of students movement and the beginning of economic leap in the early 80s. They need some medium to re-connect them together individualistic and collective, not lumping them together. Mini FM created a comfortable (safer) distance between them. This was very important in that period just after the inside fights in politics. And then they started Radio Home Run their own radio station in a bohemian center of Tokyo.</description>

      <description>There’s been a bit of a brouhaha these last weeks as parts of the Internet suddenly woke up to the realization that most Single Page Apps are slow and overcomplicated, and — shock horror — it turns out that Facebook, the lovable scamps that brought us React and QAnon, have conducted themselves badly! Refreshingly, rather than launching a thousand caustic subtweets, this little stormwind has caused the blog posts to start flying again. Thank you, Elon “Vain gobshite” Musk.

      <title>Writing confidently with ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://zknill.io/posts/writing-confidently-with-chatgpt/</link>
      <description>An AI language model As an AI language model designed to mimic human conversation, ChatGPT has encountered its fair share of criticisms. One of the most common criticisms is that ChatGPT can be overly confident in its responses. This perception arises from the fact that people often expect ChatGPT to be an all-knowing oracle that has an answer to every question. As a result, ChatGPT is sometimes judged harshly when it provides a confidently incorrect response.</description>
