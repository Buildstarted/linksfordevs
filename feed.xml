      <title>The difference between Go and Rust – dominikbraun.io</title>
      <link>https://dominikbraun.io/blog/the-difference-between-go-and-rust/</link>
      <description>Go is regularly criticized for odd decisions and idiosyncrasies, while Rust is celebrated as an almost perfectly designed alternative that solves Go&amp;#39;s problems. But in fact, Go and Rust are far from interchangeable.</description>

      <title>How to visualize decision tree</title>
      <link>https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/index.html</link>
      <description>Decision trees are the fundamental building block of gradient boosting machines and Random Forests(tm), probably the two most popular machine learning models for structured data. Visualizing decision trees is a tremendous aid when learning how these models work and when interpreting models. Unfortunately, current visualization packages are rudimentary and not immediately helpful to the novice. For example, we couldn&amp;#39;t find a library that visualizes how decision nodes split up the feature space. So, we&amp;#39;ve created a general package (part of the animl library) for scikit-learn decision tree visualization and model interpretation.</description>

      <description>FARGO, N. D. (WDAY/CNN Newsource/WKRC) - This story is nuts -- literally. A man in North Dakota has been saddled with a massive cleanup job, caused by a tiny, furry perpetrator.  (WDAY, BILL FISCHER, CNN / CNN NEWSOURCE) &amp;quot;The red squirrel will come behind, run along the frame rail and all the way up to the front,&amp;quot; said Bill Fischer. Fischer just cannot win the war. A beautiful black walnut tree in the yard produces nuts that a red squirrel finds irresistible.</description>

      <title>About Offline First &amp;#183; RxDB</title>
      <link>https://rxdb.info/offline-first.html</link>
      <description>Offline-First is a software paradigm where the software must work as well offline as it does online.
To implement this, you have to store data at the client side, so that your application can still access it when the internet goes away.
This can be either done with complex caching strategies, or by using an offline first database (like RxDB) that stores the data inside of IndexedDb and replicates it from and to the backend in the background. This makes the local database, not the server, the gateway for all persistent changes in application state.</description>

      <description>OK, this is a post I’ve been planning for months, I think? Several past drafts have been injured and killed before I gave birth to this one, the succesful one. So, let’s jump straight into it: I wanna talk about GNU.
GNU. Not the FSF, not RMS… Why are all these three letter acronyms? Are all of these cover operations of some three letter agency? I hope saying that doesn’t get me into any trouble, so you better read my post before I suddenly disappear… Just kidding!</description>

      <description>Some environments block the download and execution of DLLs from the network to prevent the potential spread of malware, which can also block downloading Blazor WebAssembly apps. To enable Blazor WebAssembly in these environments, we introduced in .NET 6 new extensibility points that allows developers to customize the published files and packaging of Blazor WebAssembly apps.</description>

      <title>A New Medium for Communicating Research on Programming Languages</title>
      <link>https://willcrichton.net/nota/</link>
      <description>Papers about programming languages involve complex notations, systems, and proofs. Static PDFs offer little support in understanding such concepts. I describe Nota, a framework for academic papers that uses the browser&amp;#39;s interactive capabilities to support comprehension in context. Nota uses hover effects, tooltips, expandable sections, toggleable explanations, and other interactions to help readers understand a language&amp;#39;s syntax and semantics. I demonstrate the use of Nota by rewriting a PL paper using its primitives, and also by writing this paper in Nota.</description>

      <description>The Create&amp;#173;Stream&amp;#173;On&amp;#173;HGlobal function lets you create a COM IStream that uses an HGLOBAL memory block as its backing store. It takes two input parameters: an optional HGLOBAL that represents the memory block to use, and a flag called fDelete&amp;#173;On&amp;#173;Release = FALSE that controls whether the stream object frees the HGLOBAL when it is destroyed.</description>
