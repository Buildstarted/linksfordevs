      <title>Deploying on Azure Functions - GitHub Actions</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/deploying-on-azure-functions-github-actions/</link>
      <description>This post is about deploying Azure Function with the help of GitHub Actions. In this post we will discuss how a .NET 6.0 Azure function can be deployed to Azure with the help of GitHub Actions - which will help you to implement continuous delivery / deployment for Azure Functions. First we need to create an Azure Function - I am doing it in the Portal. I am creating a .NET Function.</description>

      <title>EProgrammerNotFound exception in Delphi?</title>
      <link>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2084120/eprogrammernotfound-exception-in-delphi</link>
      <description>In Delphi 2009, SysUtils.pas contains this in line 425:

EProgrammerNotFound = class(Exception);
Is this simply an easter egg or something serious?
When should this exception be raised?
Does it also </description>

      <title>Xilem: an architecture for UI in Rust</title>
      <link>https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/gui/2022/05/07/ui-architecture.html</link>
      <description>Rust is an appealing language for building user interfaces for a variety of reasons, especially the promise of delivering both performance and safety. However, finding a good architecture is challenging. Architectures that work well in other languages generally don’t adapt well to Rust, mostly because they rely on shared mutable state and that is not idiomatic Rust, to put it mildly. It is sometimes asserted for this reason that Rust is a poor fit for UI. I have long believed that it is possible to find an architecture for UI well suited to implementation in Rust, but my previous attempts (including the current Druid architecture) have all been flawed. I have studied a range of other Rust UI projects and don’t feel that any of those have suitable architecture either.</description>

      <title>Original Prusa i3 MMU2S upgrade kit (for MK2.5S &amp;amp; MK3S/+) - ORG | Original Prusa 3D printers directly from Josef Prusa</title>
      <link>https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mmu2s-upgrade-kit-for-mk2-5s-mk3s-org/</link>
      <description>Multi Material Upgrade 2S (MMU2S) is a brand new and improved version of the Multi Material Upgrade 2.0 - our unique multi-material addon, which enables your 3D printer to print with up to 5 colors at the same time. With an easier calibration process, a new filament sensor, and a standalone filament buffer, the MMU2S is more reliable than ever before.
This product is supplied as a kit - you must assemble it by yourself! 
Please note, the assembly manual for the MMU2S upgrade kit is available in digital form only.
Note for MK3 users, you also need to purchase the MK3/S to MK3S+ upgrade kit with the MMU2S.</description>

      <title>How to build a BVH – part 5: TLAS &amp;amp; BLAS – Jacco’s Blog</title>
      <link>https://jacco.ompf2.com/2022/05/07/how-to-build-a-bvh-part-5-tlas-blas/</link>
      <description>In this series we explore the wonderful world of the bounding volume hierarchy: the mysterious data structure that enables real-time ray tracing on recent GPUs, in complex, animated scenes. Despite the broad adoption of ray tracing in games, in-depth understanding of the underlying technology seems to be reserved to a select few. In this article we show how a proper BVH is implemented without support from DXR / RTX / OptiX / Vulkan, in easy-to-read ‘sane C++’. Whether this is actually useful for you, or just interesting as background information, depends on your needs, obviously.</description>

      <title>It&amp;#39;s probably not just chess and language, so how much potential is getting thrown away?</title>
      <link>https://mbuffett.com/posts/missed_potential_chess_language/</link>
      <description>I’ve been heavily into chess recently, and I’m trying to improve in every way I know how; reading books, following courses, memorizing openings, analyzing games, doing puzzles. I’m an “adult improver”, as we’re known in the chess world. I may get very good, but I will never be a grandmaster, or even an international master. The only chance I had to be a grandmaster died at around the age of 10, and maybe my chances of being an IM died a few years after that.</description>

      <description>Today I nearly got stuck while learning something new. In the early years of my programming career, I got stuck all the time. Now, I rarely do. I thought I’d write about how I got from there to here, using today’s experience as a representative example of what often happens when I’m learning something new.</description>

      <title>Unix command line conventions over time</title>
      <link>https://blog.liw.fi/posts/2022/05/07/unix-cli/</link>
      <description>This blog post documents my understanding of how the conventions for Unix command line syntax have evolved over time. It’s not properly sourced, and may well be quite wrong. I’ve not been using Unix until 1989, so I wasn’t there for the early years. Maybe someone has written a proper essay on this, with citations. I’m too lazy to dig them up.</description>
