      <description>In our explorations of making co_awaitable objects, we had largely been ignoring the possibility of the coroutine handle throwing an exception upon resume. But according to the language specification, the resume method (and its equivalent, the operator() overloaded function call operator) is potentially-throwing.</description>

      <title>Catala: A Programming Language for the Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03198#:~:text=Catala%20aims%20to%20bring%20together,incorrect%20implementations%20of%20the%20law</link>
      <description>Law at large underpins modern society, codifying and governing many aspects
of citizens&amp;#39; daily lives. Oftentimes, law is subject to interpretation, debate
and challenges throughout various courts and jurisdictions. But in some other
areas, law leaves little room for interpretation, and essentially aims to
rigorously describe a computation, a decision procedure or, simply said, an
algorithm. Unfortunately, prose remains a woefully inadequate tool for the job.
The lack of formalism leaves room for ambiguities; the structure of legal
statutes, with many paragraphs and sub-sections spread across multiple pages,
makes it hard to compute the intended outcome of the algorithm underlying a
given text; and, as with any other piece of poorly-specified critical software,
the use of informal language leaves corner cases unaddressed. We introduce
Catala, a new programming language that we specifically designed to allow a
straightforward and systematic translation of statutory law into an executable
implementation. Catala aims to bring together lawyers and programmers through a
shared medium, which together they can understand, edit and evolve, bridging a
gap that often results in dramatically incorrect implementations of the law. We
have implemented a compiler for Catala, and have proven the correctness of its
core compilation steps using the F* proof assistant. We evaluate Catala on
several legal texts that are algorithms in disguise, notably section 121 of the
US federal income tax and the byzantine French family benefits; in doing so, we
uncover a bug in the official implementation. We observe as a consequence of
the formalization process that using Catala enables rich interactions between
lawyers and programmers, leading to a greater understanding of the original
legislative intent, while producing a correct-by-construction executable
specification reusable by the greater software ecosystem.</description>

      <description>Observable Plot is a free, open-source JavaScript library to help you quickly visualize tabular data. It has a concise and (hopefully) memorable API to foster fluency — and plenty of examples to learn from and copy-paste. In the spirit of show don’t tell, below is a scatterplot of the height and weight of Olympic athletes (sourced from Matt Riggott), constructed using a dot mark. We assign columns of data (such as weight) to visual properties (such as the dot’s x), and Plot infers the rest. You can</description>

      <title>The future of gRPC in C# belongs to grpc-dotnet</title>
      <link>https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-csharp-future/</link>
      <description>TL;DR grpc-dotnet (the Grpc.Net.Client and Grpc.AspNetCore.Server nuget packages) is now the recommended gRPC implementation for .NET/C#. The original gRPC C# implementation (the Grpc.Core nuget package) will enter maintenance mode and won’t be getting any new features and will only receive important bug fixes and security fixes going forward. The ultimate plan is to phase out Grpc.Core completely at some point in the future. This announcement describes the reasons why we have decided to do so and lays out the plan in more detail.</description>

      <description>No pie charts were harmed in the making of this logo. We are thrilled to announce Observable Plot, a new open-source JavaScript library for exploratory data visualization. Observable’s mission is to help everyone make sense of the world with data. To succeed, we need to make visualization easier and faster, both to learn and to practice. Less chore, more joy.

      <description>Over the past couple months, I’ve spent several hundred bucks on sponsoring newsletters. It’s an interesting format. Instead of targeting via algorithm (as in FB/Google ads), you target by picking newsletters with relevant topics. I kind of like it.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;I work on ads at Google&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Can I ask why? I honestly can&amp;#39;t understand how anyone could.&amp;quot;  Someone recently asked me why I work on ads, and I wanted to write up something more thorough than my comment. (Despite being a work topic this is a personal post and I&amp;#39;m speaking only for myself.)  One answer is that I&amp;#39;m earning to give: I give half of what I earn to the most effective charities I can find,</description>

      <description>If you follow the tech scene in any way, you will not have missed the ongoing self-immolation of the company Basecamp.
