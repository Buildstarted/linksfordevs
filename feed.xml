      <title>The worst so-called “best practice” for Docker</title>
      <link>https://pythonspeed.com/articles/security-updates-in-docker/</link>
      <description>Somebody is always wrong on the Internet, and bad Docker packaging advice is quite common. But one particular piece of advice keeps coming up, and it’s dangerous enough to merit its own article. In a whole bunch of places you will be told not to install security updates when building your Docker image. This advice is given by the official Docker docs’ best practices page: Avoid RUN apt-get upgrade and dist-upgrade, as many of the “essential” packages from the parent images cannot upgrade inside an unprivileged container. To be clear: RUN commands happen during image build, not during container startup. The documentation there is saying “build your images without installing security updates”. You’ll see the same advice in the hadolint Dockerfile linter (it cites the above), and you’ll even see it in the OWASP Docker cheatsheet: Avoid the use of apt/apk upgrade For the vast majority of people creating Dockerfiles this is absolutely awful advice. And since this bad advice is so common, let’s consider some of the justifications and why they are wrong.</description>

      <title>Do Not Split</title>
      <link>https://fieldofvision.org/do-not-split</link>
      <description>Told from within the heart of the Hong Kong protests, “Do Not Split” begins in 2019 as a proposed bill allowing the Chinese government to extradite criminal suspects to mainland China escalated protests throughout Hong Kong. Unfolding across a year, “Do Not Split” captures the determination and sacrifices of the protesters, the government’s backlash, and the passage of the new Beijing-backed national security law.</description>

      <title>Closing web browser windows doesn&amp;#39;t close connections</title>
      <link>https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/closing.html</link>
      <description>Months ago I noticed something strange in the Little Snitch Network Monitor: Safari was still connecting to web sites after every window had been closed. At the time, I thought this was just a Safari bug. I brought the issue to the attention of some Safari engineers, who I had hoped would look into it. Since then, Safari has seen several software updates, and recently I remembered to check again to see whether the issue was resolved. Unfortunately I could still reproduce it, so I decided to investigate further. To my horror, I discovered that Chrome and Firefox were doing it too. That&amp;#39;s too much a coincidence to be a bug, right? Could it be that web browsers are keeping open connections after windows are closed on purpose? If you don&amp;#39;t have Little Snitch installed on the Mac (you should!), you can still see the open (ESTABLISHED) connections using the lsof (list open files) command-line tool in Terminal:</description>

      <description>This article will discuss about testing web applications with the help of PlaywrightSharp and C#. PlaywrightSharp is a .Net library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browsers with a single API. Playwright delivers automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast. On May 2020, Microsoft introduced Playwright - an open-source Node.js library to write cross-browser automation tests - that are fast, reliable and capable. You can find more details about Playwright on playwright.dev. Playwright takes the basic Puppeteer architecture and moves it more in the direction of Selenium, adding a web automation framework and improving how Puppeteer interacts with page content. As mentioned earlier it is a Node.js library. There is no direct way you can use Node.js apps from .NET. PlaywrightSharp is a nuget package which a C# binding of Playwright library.</description>

      <description>For around a year and a half, I’ve been working with a project that was initially written in Vb.Net, but now newer code is written in C#. It’s a great example of how one project can be written in two languages, and code in Vb.net can reference C# and the other way round.</description>

      <description>I am learning C++, and what better way to make the learning stick more stronger than blogging about my journey and experience, especially thinking that the barrier to entry is quite high and there is too much to learn. So, the reason that this post exists is a bit selfish, but I am hoping it will be helpful to some other folks who are going through the same struggles as I am. In this post, I will go over details of what it takes to work with dependencies in C++ and how the compilation and linking process works.</description>

      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-problem-with-odoo/</link>
      <description>The history with Odoo started with TinyERP / OpenERP which was a free ERP System. This was a great idea and pioneered the open source ERP environment.
But in the last years the name and the vision changed. Now Odoo provides besides the ERP part also a CRM, CMS, Blogs, Forums, E-commerce (Online-Shops), Timesheet, Project Management, Inventory Management, Recruitment, Spreadsheet, Documents, Email Marketing&amp;amp;hellip;
So in short: Odoo changed from a focus on ERP to an all-in-one solution which seems to cover nearly every application a business needs.</description>
