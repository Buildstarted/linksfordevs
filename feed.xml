      <title>Map Physical Paths with an HttpContext.MapPath() Extension Method in ASP.NET</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2023/Aug/15/Map-Physical-Paths-with-an-HttpContextMapPath-Extension-Method-in-ASPNET</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core doesn&amp;#39;t have a Server.MapPath() method as classic ASP.NET had, and getting at the root path in Core is a little bit more involved than in those older versions. In this post I describe how to find the application Content and Web root folders and describe a MapPath() helper that simulates the old behavior.</description>

      <description>Land-use and transportation planning is supposed to follow a rational planning process. That process includes defining the problem that needs to be solved, identifying alternative solutions, evaluating the alternatives, developing a final plan based on the best alternative or combination of alternatives, implementing the plan, monitoring the effects to see how well reality matches planning assumptions, and using the results of that monitoring as feedback into future plans.</description>
