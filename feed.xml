      <title>I Built My First Google Chrome Extension!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xq_QfYdmMQ</link>
      <description>As a developer, it's nice to be able to create things to make your life easier. I was tired of having to open up my videos just to copy the link and share it. So, I created my first Chrome Extension! It shows me a list of my most recent videos and allows me to copy the link directly!

      <title>Workshop: Hack Yourself First: How to go on the Cyber-Offence - Day 1/2 - NDC TechTown 2020</title>
      <link>https://ndctechtown.com/talk/workshop-hack-yourself-first-how-to-go-on-the-cyber-offence-day-1-2/</link>
      <description>Day 1/2
&lt;br&gt;
Cyber-attacks have become a reality of running software on the web today. We find ourselves under a constant barrage of malicious activity from hacktivists, online criminals and increasingly, nation states. Successful attacks from these adversaries are predominantly via flaws in the software products they target – flaws that could have been prevented by developers understanding how online attackers work and what the appropriate defensive measures are.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Reactive Extensions for .NET | endjin</title>
      <link>https://endjin.com/what-we-think/talks/reactive-extensions-for-dotnet.html</link>
      <description>The Reactive Extensions for .NET (&amp;quot;Rx&amp;quot; for short) are a set of libraries for working with asynchronous and event-based information sources. While Rx has become widely adopted in client-side code, its roots are in highly scalable server-side processing.
In this talk, Ian Griffiths shows why Rx should be a critical part of any .NET developer's toolbox, and shows a real-world application that illustrates how the powerful processing and orchestration facilities Rx provides can be applied to collect and process data in edge devices and then stream the high-value events to an Azure IoT hub for further analysis in the cloud.

      <title>Tip 273 - Getting started with Azure Image Builder</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip273.html</link>
      <description>Having standard Virtual Machine (VM) images can help you to make sure that your VMs are all configured the same and have the same properties and security policies applied to them. You can create VM images with the Azure Image Builder. This allows you to define VM images in json format, store them somewhere (like in the Azure Shared Image Gallery), build them and deploy them into VMs.</description>

      <title>You don't need this fancy recommendations system</title>
      <link>https://manuel.darcemont.fr/posts/you-dont-need-this-fancy-recommendations-system/</link>
      <description>I spent years on looking for a powerful and accurate recommendations system that would give me the titles of the movies I was desperately needing to bring my film knowledge to completeness (we movie buffs are quite obsessional - and we try to heal ourselves with making lists). The more I discovered new movies and new directors, the more the recommendations engine I was using were proved ineffective.
It looks like we try to address the need for recommendations always with the same tools and the same approach, regardless of the matter.</description>

      <title>I want to contribute to your project, how do I start?</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/10/How-to-contribute-to-FOSS.html</link>
      <description>I get this question a lot! The answer is usually… don’t. If you already know what you want to do, then the question doesn’t need to be asked.1 But, if you don’t already know what you want to do, then your time might be better spent elsewhere! Or perhaps the better question is “where should I start with this goal?” ↩</description>

      <title>Advices on writing blog posts</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-writing-blog-posts/</link>
      <description>At work, I’ve recently been asked to advise our engineers on how to write blog posts. A lot of such articles are already available. However, they tend to focus around two main themes: The technical publishing platform e.g. Jekyll, Medium, etc.Metrics e.g. readability score, SEO, etc. Beyond that, everyone is on one’s own. But I believe that writing a good technical article is as much art as engineering. In this post, I’d like to try to address this gap: I’ve been writi</description>
