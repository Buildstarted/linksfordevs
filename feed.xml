      <title>Why is there a normal galaxy sitting at the edge of the Universe?</title>
      <link>https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/why-is-there-a-normal-galaxy-sitting-at-the-edge-of-the-universe</link>
      <description>Aided by a trick of gravity, astronomers have found a normal galaxy. Big deal, right? The thing is, where they found it is not normal: The light we see from it left the galaxy 12.4 billion years ago, meaning we’re seeing it as it was when the Universe itself was only 1.4 billion years old! That’s what makes this so weird. A normal galaxy has no business being there when the cosmos was so young. But yet, there it sits.</description>

      <title>Learn C# with CSharpFritz - Ep 3:  C# Methods, Events, and Delegates for Beginners</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E2xB4kOSV0</link>
      <description>This is episode 3 of C# with CSharpFritz and Jeff walks through methods, events, and delegates in this beginner-friendly episode.

Interactive Notebook with samples you can run IN BROWSER at:  https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/main

After the C# basics sessions are completed, which user interface framework do you want Fritz to walk through FIRST?  Vote for your favorite with an emote at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/issues/13

Questions:
25:51 - Is it considered bad practice to use a nested class?
39:20 - When writing methods, is it a rule that they do one thing and one thing only?
42:15 - How do you create a method with a 'real' optional value?
44:28 - Can I write a reusable method to do that, so that all of my API calls can reuse that method?
51:49 - What's a good rule on the number of out parameters vs returning an object with those values instead?
1:00:33 - Is ref used with value types to change their value within the method?
1:06:02 - What happens when you assign a new instance of a class to a parameter inside of a method?
1:12:00 - Are delegates the same as a callback function?
1:14:40 - If data types are not specified when assigning a delegate, would it automatically infer the type?
1:25:48 - Can a list of delegates be executed?
1:30:46 - Is it possible to use a non-void-return-type delegate as the type for an event, and then process the subscriber list with GetInvocationList()?
1:47:30 - What's the difference between abstract classes and partial classes?

Full Lyrics:
There's MQ, EC2,
And RedShift and GameLift and Glue.
There's Lumberyard, Lightsail and Workdocs and Workmail, with Worklink and PrivateLink too.
Detective, Inspector, and Trusted Advisor, Cognito, Corretto, S3 -
Data Pipeline and DataSync, AppMesh and AppSync, 
or you can use SimpleDB. But don't!
Appstream, Timestream, Augmented AI, Auto Scaling, Lambda, Amplify.
Ohh, DirectConnect or just Connect, Config and RDS -
These are the major services of AWS.
CLI, CDK, Textract, Lex, FSx and XRay.
SNS, STS, SQS, SES, EFS, do your best, it's okay.
There's Athena and Polly and Kendra and Macie. Alexa for Business, Cloud 9 --
And there's CodeBuild and CodeDeploy, CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeGuru, CodeStar, and Chatbot and Chime.

Translate, Transcribe, Transfer Family -
All the many Things of IoT.
Ohhh there's CloudFormation, Lake Formation, Free RTOS - 
These are the major services of AWS.
Honeycode. Elemental. VMWare on AWS.
(This key change is brought to you by ... )

Now it's time for Global Accelerator!!

Yeah, there's Braket and Budgets and Backup and Batch, ECS, EKS, EBS -

For all intents and purposes,
