      <title>An Outside-In Approach to Discover Unknown Codebases</title>
      <link>https://goatreview.com/outside-approach-discover-unknown-codebases/</link>
      <description>Jumping into a new codebase is never easy. It takes time, patience, and often a fair bit of frustration. And when the codebase is legacy — undocumented, inconsistent, and complex — the challenge grows infinitely...

In this article, based on the work we've done with my colleague Alexandre Trigueros for our workshop</description>

      <title>Tim Cook vs. Steve Jobs</title>
      <link>https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2025/8/2.html</link>
      <description>On Friday I published a glowing book review of Apple in China by Patrick McGee. Coincidentally, on the same day UnHerd published an article by Patrick McGee, Time is running out for Tim Cook: Apple lacks strategic vision. I continue to admire McGee’s reporting, continue to recommend his book, and this new article hasn’t changed my mind about that. However, reporters who have made a name for themselves have a tendency to want to become commentators, to add their opinions to their factual reporting. In my own opinion, the opinions of reporters are no better than anyone else’s opinion. The ability to get quality news scoops doesn’t automatically make someone superior at analyzing the implications of that news. Another example of this phenomenon is Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, a prolific source of Apple leaks, unparalleled in tech reporting history; I salute his uncanny prowess as a reporter. Nonetheless, his opinions are pedestrian at best, ill-advised at worst, and I find it regrettable that Gurman’s articles sometimes muddy the distinction between his leaks and his opinions.</description>

      <description>Whether from ambition, arrogance or lack of discipline, OpenAI is in trouble today. The company must overcome significant internal and market issues if it is to survive the coming years.
A handful of fault‑lines will determine the outcome. Any structural weakness surrounding these foundational elements of AI’s present and future could burst ambitions that may very well have already reached bubble territory.</description>
