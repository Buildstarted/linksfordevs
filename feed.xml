ABSTRACT
Microservices have been a popular architecture choice for at least 5 years by now. Over these years we've adopted microservices architectures to ever growing set of use-cases and different development and deployment strategies. Lessons were learned and our ability to design, develop, deploy and operate microservices has improved.
This presentation will give an opinionated view of how microservices evolved in the last few years, based on experience gained while working with companies using Apache Kafka to update their application architecture. We'll discuss the rise of API gateways, service mesh, state management and serverless architectures - what works well, and in which cases. We'll show real-world examples of how applications become more resilient and scalable when new patterns are introduced, and make sure to include caveats - because patterns [...]

      <title>US Senators Introduce 'Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act' — With Backdoor Mandate | News Bitcoin News</title>
      <link>https://news.bitcoin.com/lawful-access-to-encrypted-data-act-backdoor/</link>
      <description>US lawmakers have introduced the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act to ensure law enforcement can access encrypted information. This bill is "a full-frontal nuclear assault on encryption in the United States," one expert says. It requires manufacturers of encrypted devices and operating systems to have the ability to decrypt data upon request, creating a backdoor requirement.</description>

      <description>Looking for a job sucks. A couple of months ago, I was going through interview after interview like a wrecking ball blasting through concrete.

I don't tour, I don't sell merch and I'm not on a major label. I'm just a small indie artist making music in my evenings— and Spotify is making that possible.</description>

      <title>Understanding SSIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13846</link>
      <description>The use of the structural similarity index (SSIM) is widespread. For almost
two decades, it has played a major role in image quality assessment in many
different research disciplines. Clearly, its merits are indisputable in the
research community. However, little deep scrutiny of this index has been
performed. Contrary to popular belief, there are some interesting properties of
SSIM that merit such scrutiny. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical
factors of SSIM and show that it can generate results, in both synthetic and
realistic use cases, that are unexpected, sometimes undefined, and
nonintuitive. As a consequence, assessing image quality based on SSIM can lead
to incorrect conclusions and using SSIM as a loss function for deep learning
can guide neural network training in the wrong direction.</description>

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSoHaO3YqH8</link>
      <description>I mean I call it reverse enhancing since it is really taking the other way to enhance... It works really well though! And to be fair, nothing could really be enhanced if there are already information that is inadequate. You will need to generate new facial information, and this AI could be the best way to do it! Just need more training like usual though.

      <title>How to embed JavaScript components in C# built Uno WebAssembly Web Applications - Uno Platform</title>
      <link>https://platform.uno/blog/how-to-embed-javascript-components-in-c-built-uno-webassembly-web-applications/</link>
      <description>We often get asked if it is possible to integrate Uno-WASM Web Applications with existing JavaScript components. Since WebAssembly code is running inside browser’s JavaScript context, the answer is “Yes” and it is actually quite simple to do it. In this article we will explore how you can create interoperability (interop) between Uno-WASM managed code and JavaScript context of an application. The two sample apps with code we provide will help you understand how to use the integration in actual application code. For the purpose of the examples we will create an application using a well known date/time picker control called Flartpickr as well as syntax visualizer called PrismJS. In the end you will generate applications looking like this:   Leveraging the Uno.WASM Bootstrapper At the heart of Uno-WASM, there’s a package called Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap (Uno Bootstrapper) project. It contains the tooling required to build, package, deploy, run and debug a .NET project in a web browser using WebAssembly. HTML5 Is a Rich and Powerful Platform Uno Platform fully embraces HTML5 as its display backend when targeting WebAssembly (WASM). As a result, creating hybrid HTML/Uno-WASM apps becomes easy. That also means application can reuse existing JavaScript components directly, often unchanged. Access …</description>

      <title>Fix Your Timestep! | Gaffer On Games</title>
      <link>https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/</link>
      <description>Introduction Hi, I’m Glenn Fiedler and welcome to Game Physics.
In the previous article we discussed how to integrate the equations of motion using a numerical integrator. Integration sounds complicated, but it’s just a way to advance the your physics simulation forward by some small amount of time called “delta time” (or dt for short).
But how to choose this delta time value? This may seem like a trivial subject but in fact there are many different ways to do it, each with their own strengths and weaknesses - so read on!</description>
