      <title>We Rewrote the Ghostty GTK Application</title>
      <link>https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-gtk-rewrite</link>
      <description>We just completed
rewriting the Ghostty GTK application fully embracing the
GObject type system from Zig
and also verifying with Valgrind every step of the way.
The result is a more feature rich, stable, and maintainable Ghostty
on Linux and BSD.</description>

      <title>Typing to Think, Speaking to Prompt</title>
      <link>https://www.kvncnnlly.com/2025-08-13-typing-as-thinking-or-not/</link>
      <description>My earlier post about the rise of voice as a UI had me pondering what exactly is it that makes voice input ideal in some circumstances and entirely undesired in others. Spoken language is faster per word and, in a naive economic sense, ‚Äúbetter‚Äù1. And yet, there are times where I have no interest in ‚Äúgoing fast‚Äù. Why?
This topic makes me think of Andy Clark‚Äôs Supersizing the Mind, which opens with a famous Feynman quote about insisting that his ‚Äúdaily notes‚Äù were not simply a record of his activities but his actual thinking:</description>

      <title>Is MCP just a WSDL Reboot for LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://relantic.com/radar/mcp-wsdl.html</link>
      <description>If the Model Context Protocol gives you 2005 vibes, you‚Äôre not imagining it. MCP feels like the good part of the old web-services dream brought forward for AI agents: describe what you can do, let a generic client discover it, and integrate without bespoke glue. That was the pitch behind WSDL in the Web 2.0 era‚ÄîWeb Services Description Language‚Äîan XML contract where a service declared its operations, messages, and types so tools could generate clients automatically. If you‚Äôve never seen it, the original specs still read like a time capsule: WSDL 1.1 and WSDL 2.0.</description>

      <description>The feed-forward network in an LLM processes context vectors one at a time. This feels like it would cause similar issues to the old fixed-length bottleneck, even though it almost certainly does not.</description>

      <description>TL;DR # I tried competitive programming for a whole year and it didn‚Äôt work out well for me, I didn‚Äôt enjoy it and didn‚Äôt achieve anything remarkable as well. So it‚Äôs better to take the L and move on and try other things I wanted to try, but I couldn‚Äôt because of competitive programming. For the rest of the article I‚Äôm going to talk about the sunk cost fallacy.</description>

      <title>Lasso Transactions as an alternative to Copyright</title>
      <link>https://rasmuskirk.com/articles/2025-06-18_lasso-transactions-as-an-alternative-to-copyright/</link>
      <description>Often, people who oppose copyright give weak
                  excuses as for how a market would sustain artists
                  creating work, without the government creating an
                  artificial monopoly on said work. In a recent
                  conversation with one of my friends who also oppose
                  many aspects of the current copyright system, we
                  brainstormed alternatives. I opposed the traditional
                  donation model as it‚Äôs highly subject to free-rider
                  problem, and demanded that a new model be
                  created1, if we should
                  reasonably expect to convince people to oppose
                  copyright.</description>
