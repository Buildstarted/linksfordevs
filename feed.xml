      <title>Web3 is centralized (and inefficient!)</title>
      <link>https://www.neelc.org/posts/web3-centralized/</link>
      <description>These days, an app is “decentralized” if it uses the blockchain. As you probably already know, this is part of the so-called “Web3” which hopes to be the next version of the internet.
I’m not the first person to tell you this, and certainly not the last, but Web3 is in fact centralized, just as Web2 was. Web3 is just a worse version of Web2.

      <link>https://www.morling.dev/blog/the-code-review-pyramid/</link>
      <description>When it comes to code reviews, it’s a common phenomenon that there is much focus and long-winded discussions around mundane aspects like code formatting and style, whereas important aspects (does the code change do what it is supposed to do, is it performant, is it backwards-compatible for existing clients, and many others) tend to get less attention.
 To raise awareness for the issue and providing some guidance on aspects to focus on, I shared a small visual on Twitter the other day, which I called the &amp;quot;</description>

      <description>How difficult could it be to reduce a PDF file size? Apparently, in this instance, very!
Google Docs generated PDFs have risen to monstrous sizes, relatively speaking (and I&amp;amp;rsquo;m not alone). Recently, I needed to convert a Google Docs generted PDF, which was coming out to be at 5 MB, under a certain size (2MB) due to an upload limit. I tried to compress the said PDF through MacOS Preview&amp;amp;rsquo;s built in &amp;amp;ldquo;Reduce File Size&amp;amp;rdquo; filters which in this rare instance didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t work.</description>
