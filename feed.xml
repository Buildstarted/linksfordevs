      <title>Compromising OpenWrt Supply Chain via Truncated SHA-256 Collision and Command Injection</title>
      <link>https://flatt.tech/research/posts/compromising-openwrt-supply-chain-sha256-collision/</link>
      <description>Introduction Hello, I’m RyotaK (@ryotkak ), a security engineer at Flatt Security Inc.
A few days ago, I was upgrading my home lab network, and I decided to upgrade the OpenWrt on my router.1 After accessing the LuCI, which is the web interface of OpenWrt, I noticed that there is a section called Attended Sysupgrade, so I tried to upgrade the firmware using it.
After reading the description, I found that it states it builds new firmware using an online service.</description>

      <title>[Monkey Conf 2024] How We Build an Open-Source Cross-Platform Framework in .NET</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=ns9EiKLlxsQ</link>
      <description>Ever wondered what it takes to build a complex cross-platform, open-source framework in .NET? In this session, we’ll walk through the complex engineering challenges and innovative solutions that power Uno Platform as a robust, single-codebase framework. Discover how we leverage advanced .NET techniques—such as Source Generators, how we built a custom MSBuild SDK called Uno.Sdk including the support for custom target framework identifiers, how we run a sophisticated, multi-stage CI pipeline in Azure DevOps with thousands of tests on all possible platforms and make sure we avoid making unintended breaking changes, and we will even explore the strategies used to port C++ code to C#.

      <title>LINQ might get a &amp;quot;left join&amp;quot; operator in .net 10</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/82ebfd51-23c0-44b7-9602-628d1aba5f3c</link>
      <description>LINQ has a Join operator, that basically translates to something like a SQL INNER JOIN. There is no built in operator for a LEFT JOIN in LINQ, but you can achieve the same result by using a combination of GroupJoin, SelectMany and DefaultIfEmpty. But there is a chance that this might change in the future, as there is a proposal to add a LeftJoin operator in .net 10.

      <title>Replace Buf Remote Plugins with local vendored plugins - Johannes&amp;#39; blog</title>
      <link>https://nerden.de/replace_buf_remote_plugins/</link>
      <description>Buf is the best tool to manage protobufs. One of the biggest pain points of protobuf is the management of protoc plugins. You need to manage them, and make them available to other engineers working on the same repository/project. Versions need to be centrally managed, code generation must produce the same result, no matter if it happens on an engineer A or B’s machine, or in CI.
This becomes even more challenging, as protoc plugins are written in different programming languages.</description>
