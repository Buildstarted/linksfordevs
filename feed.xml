      <title>Tip 260 - Using Azure Functions Premium Plan to avoid cold-start</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip260.html</link>
      <description>Azure Functions are incredible. You can use them to run pieces of code, without having to create the plumbing to run a complete application. This is perfect for processes that you run in the background or that are decoupled from your application (like a process that resizes images that users upload).
You can run Azure Functions serverless, in their Consumption pricing plan. This is great, because Functions that run in the consumption plan, scale automatically. And you only pay for functions that you execute, you don't pay the whole month for having a function that can run.</description>

      <title>Provide support for C# on Databricks</title>
      <link>https://feedback.azure.com/forums/909463-azure-databricks/suggestions/34887751-provide-support-for-c-on-databricks</link>
      <description>There are (at least) two use cases of it:
 - Migrate large number of (hundreds) data pipelines running on ADLA  to Databrick. Those data pipelines usually have heavy business logic built in C# library. It will be a huge cost to re-write the code in Java
 - Most ML applications have online prod environment and offline experiment environment. If the application has parts of its logic built in C# library (e.g. featuring), it will be a big headache if prod environment only allows .net library while the offline experiment does not support it, i.e. having to maintain two code bases.</description>
