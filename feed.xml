      <title>The PostgreSQL Locking Trap That Killed Our Production API (and How We Fixed It)</title>
      <link>https://root.sigsegv.in/posts/postgresql-locking-trap/</link>
      <description>TL;DR A simple ALTER TABLE statement can bring down your production infrastructure if youâ€™re not careful. This is the story of me waking up to production alerts while working on totally unrelated tasks (building slides for some business stuff), getting bamboozled, instinctively blaming most recent production infrastructure change and eventually figuring out how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Here is the chain of events if you are skimming through:
Google Cloud monitoring policy triggered on database error threshold breach Production APIs showing high latency and intermittent timeouts Initially blamed the recently deployed database read replicas as the root cause Stopped replication, restarted database instance for service restoration Quickly figured out the issue reappeared on high load Manually deleted PostgreSQL replication slot from primary database instance Manually deleted read replica instances (non-critical), hoping against hope Raised support ticket with Google cloud Slow query analysis showed multiple pending ALTER TABLE .</description>

      <title>Average - Johan Halse</title>
      <link>https://johan.hal.se/wrote/2025/06/19/average/</link>
      <description>I managed to survive the rise and fall of the blockchain without writing a single goddamn word about it. So it is with a heavy heart I take to the keyboard this time, because as you probably surmised upon reading the B-word, this post is me finally waving my white flag and writing something about AI. I&amp;#39;m sorry, and I wish things could be different, but this is apparently what the world wants and I am powerless in the face of it.

      <title>Allocators are Monkeys With Typewriters</title>
      <link>https://tgmatos.github.io/allocators-are-for-monkeys-with-typewriters/</link>
      <description>Recently I was looking at an issue on mimalloc, a "state-of-the-art" memory allocator developed by Microsoft. The issue was quite simple, developers wanted a way to preallocate a piece of memory and use it as mimalloc's heap. Seeing that mimalloc does not offer this feature, I thought:</description>
