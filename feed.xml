      <title>The Philips Hue ecosystem is collapsing into stupidity</title>
      <link>https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2023/09/26/hue/</link>
      <description>If you&amp;#39;ve gotten into the home automation thing in the past few years, 
it&amp;#39;s possible you set up some Philips Hue devices along the way.  This 
was an ecosystem which had a bunch of bulbs, switches, outlets and a hub 
that spoke Zigbee on one side and Ethernet on the other.  It was pretty 
much no-nonsense, never dropped commands, and just sat there and worked.  
Also, it integrated with the Apple Homekit ecosystem perfectly.</description>

      <title>Rediscovering Web 1.0 Principles in Virtual Worlds</title>
      <link>https://www.richardanaya.com/p/rediscovering-web-10-principles-in</link>
      <description>The dream of three-dimensional cyberspace was imagined decades ago in a world that did not yet have the available technology to realize it. Meanwhile, a different kind of interactive world was forming in the World Wide Web, and web developers have been unlocking its potential ever since. There’s an important lesson in history catching up with us, one fundamental to all interactive worlds (not just the web), with the possibility of redefining the trajectory of the metaverse’s technological future. In this article I talk about a new open source library I’ve created – HyperShape – that implemented 3D worlds in a fundamentally different way and what my discoveries were when making it.</description>

      <title>SQLite insert speed</title>
      <link>https://voidstar.tech/sqlite_insert_speed/</link>
      <description>A little-discussed method enables inserting rows with bound data into SQLite
faster than any existing technique. This novel method is
then discovered to have a drawback that makes it generally unusable. The rest
of this article explores how to get the best insert performance out of SQLite
generally; what&amp;#39;s in your control, and what isn&amp;#39;t. Use the links above to jump
to a section, or skip to the end for the most
important performance tips.</description>
