      <description>I was browsing HackerNews recently and a (rare) agriculture news story popped up, this one to be specific, but there are others. As these are of interest to me I clicked and read through the comments. These linked articles aren’t all that note-worthy, but they are indicative of a trend. As a casual follower of the Ag startup scene and witnessing the vertical farming fascination for the past ~10 years grow, I’ve been genuinely confused as to some of the approaches founders are taking with their startups. For the longest time, I believed the hype that vertical farming was needed and more importantly, coming to a city near you™. This implies and inherent inefficiency in both current food production and its distribution chains.</description>

      <title>Introduction to quantum computing with Q# – Part 4, multi-qubit gates</title>
      <link>https://www.strathweb.com/2020/06/introduction-to-quantum-computing-with-q-part-4-multi-qubit-gates/</link>
      <description>In the previous post of this series, we discussed single qubit gates. In this next instalment, we are going to explore gates that act on multiple qubits at once, thus completing the exploration of quantum circuit building. We are also going to slowly, but diligently uncover the underlying theoretical scheme towards one of the most bizarre concepts in quantum mechanics – entanglement, which is something that will be dedicating the next part to.</description>

      <title>F# and Functional Programming!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_OB7GiGypg</link>
      <description>Functional Programming and F# have been around for a while now and many developers aren't really familiar with what it is, how it helps, or when to use it. We decided to bring in an expert to help answer these questions. This week, we welcome Stachu Korick to the show to teach our hosts a thing or two and have some fun. Please join Chris, Andy, and Rich with Stachu this week, live on The Dev Talk Show.

Join us every Wednesday at 8:30pm US Eastern time right here on YouTube or on our other streaming platforms:

https://mixer.com/thedevtalkshow

We love to have an open conversation with you during the show.  We answer your questions and appreciate your thoughts on what we're working on.</description>

      <description>Facebook and its subsidiaries, including Instagram, account for 75% of all time spent on social media. In a new paper, Yale SOM economist Fiona Scott Morton writes that the company took control of the industry by misleading consumers and buying up rivals. Scott Morton is the founder and director of the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale, which performs and disseminates research on antitrust policy and enforcement. </description>
