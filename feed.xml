      <description>Michael Outlaw is a father, husband, and software developer based out of Atlanta, GA. A fan of gadgets and all things technology, when he isn’t found behind the clickety clack of his favorite mechanical keyboard he’s usually found riding a bicycle on his favorite road or trail systems. A father of two boys, Michael often spends his free time teaching his boys how to lose with dignity as they destroy him in game franchises like Overwatch, Halo, and Call of Duty. When not sharing his love of Git, C#, and unit testing, he can be found spending his “study time” studying the sounds of guitar and music theory.</description>

      <title>What makes frontend development tricky</title>
      <link>https://www.abhinavomprakash.com/posts/what-makes-frontend-development-tricky/</link>
      <description>Preface This blogpost took over a month to write, it’s what I like to call exploratory writing where I explore some ideas that I have, or a new topic that I don’t know about and share it with you. It isn’t as polished as I’d like it to be. I also need to find a better way to present UI code, like having a live UI to interact with. The writing is quite long, there is a lot of code, but hopefully you’ll make it through.</description>

      <title>How to get your startup ISO27001 certified in 2023, explained for cloud-native companies</title>
      <link>https://opshack.dev/posts/how-to-get-your-startup-iso27001-certified-on-cloud/</link>
      <description>Introduction We recently at Respond.io happily received our first compliance certification under the framework ISO 27001. This certification verifies your organization with the world’s best-known standard for information security management systems (ISMS), ensuring that the said organization has put in place a system to manage risks related to the security of data owned or handled by them.
As the person in charge of infrastructure security and one of the contributors on a small team leading this initiative, I would like to share a few tips for developers and DevOps enthusiasts who are less familiar with organizational compliance from a technical point of view.</description>
