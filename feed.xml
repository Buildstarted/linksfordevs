      <title>How a Lazy Bitch like me learned to be Productive</title>
      <link>https://www.madisontaskett.com/lazy-bastard-productivity/</link>
      <description>Before, I was a train wreck that ate too many cinnamon rolls and watched Netflix while laying in sweats on the couch. Today, I ran 3 miles, did 40 minutes of yoga, meditated, ate steel cut oats with berries for breakfast, then turned on my favorite business podcast while I showered, all before work.</description>

      <title>Why is Artificial Intelligence So Useless for Business?</title>
      <link>https://mebassett.info/ai-useless-for-business</link>
      <description>Today's work in artificial intelligence is amazing.
We've taught computers to beat the most advanced players in the most
complex games.
We've taught them to drive cars and create photo-realistic videos and
images of people.
They can re-create works of fine-art and emulate the best writers.
Yet I know that many businesses still need people to, e.g., read PDF
documents about an office building and write down the sizes of the
leasable units contained therein.
If artificial intelligence can do all that, why can't it read a PDF
document and transform it into a machine-readable format?
Today's artificial intelligence algorithms can recreate playable
versions of Pacman just from playing games against itself 1.
So why can't I get a computer to translate my colleague's financial
spreadsheet into the format my SAP software wants?</description>

      <title>Today’s Javascript, from an outsider’s perspective</title>
      <link>http://lea.verou.me/2020/05/todays-javascript-from-an-outsiders-perspective/</link>
      <description>Today I tried to help a friend who is a great computer scientist, but not a JS person use a JS module he found on Github. Since for the past 6 years my day job is doing usability research &amp; teaching at MIT, I couldn’t help but cringe at the slog that this was. Lo and behold, a pile of unnecessary error conditions, cryptic errors, and lack of proper feedback. And I don’t feel I did a good job communicating the frustration he went through in the one hour or so until he gave up.</description>
