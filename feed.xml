      <title>Stored Procedure in Entity Framework Core Migrations</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/creating-stored-procs-in-efcore-migrations/</link>
      <description>SQL Server stored procedure is a set of SQL statements grouped as a logical unit and stored in the database. The stored procedure can accepts input parameters and executes the T-SQL statements in the procedure, can return the result. If you’re using Entity Framework Code first approach there is no direct way to create stored procedure in C# code. You can execute a stored procedure in Entity Framework with the help of FromSqlInterpolated method. Here is an example.</description>

      <description>There seem to be a few interesting trends in “security via hardware” these days. 
The first trend is root-of-trust chips. Integrated TPM-like chips that are like crypto Swiss Army knives as they offer many functionalities out of the box. They resemble discrete TPMs but are instead integrated directly into the main processor. This makes these newer chips faster, and also more resistant to physical  ...</description>

      <link>https://bedaring.org/post/a-boring-dystopia/the-north-side/</link>
      <description>I wake up in the morning with cold sweat on my face, and my heart skips a beat, as if to remind me I’ll soon die. I look out the window to my dark, grey city, and I ponder away, time passing in my head. How soon will I be dead? I don’t know. I brush the thoughts off with my comb and rinse them out with my coffee. A clear brain and jittery hands start me through the day. An omelette, some tomatoes. All a little qeasy-making. Processed food. Forced to lay eggs, forced to breed, forced to make food.</description>

      <title>I Actually Like Slack</title>
      <link>https://patrick.engineering/posts/slack/</link>
      <description>As a software engineer, you really need your focus time. Unfortunately, distractions are everywhere! It might be snowing outside, or you might be wondering if now is the perfect time to get a coffee. Then it happens—someone has used Slack’s @channel tag to completely interrupt everybody else, including you.
This scenario may sound familiar. The reason is that Slack has given the nuclear codes to everyone in the company, allowing them to destroy productivity with one single command.</description>

      <title>Gregory Szorc&amp;#39;s Digital Home | Modern CI is Too Complex and Misdirected</title>
      <link>https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2021/04/07/modern-ci-is-too-complex-and-misdirected/</link>
      <description>The state of CI platforms is much stronger than it was just a few years ago.
Overall, this is a good thing: access to powerful CI platforms enables
software developers and companies to ship more reliable software more
frequently, which benefits its users/customers. Centralized CI platforms
like GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, and Bitbucket provide benefits of
scale, as the Internet serves as a collective information repository for
how to use them. Do a search for how to do X on CI platform Y and
you&amp;#39;ll typically find some code you can copy and paste. Nobody wants to
toil with wrangling their CI configuration after all: they just want
to ship.</description>
