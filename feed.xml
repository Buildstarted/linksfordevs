      <title>A new coefficient of correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10140</link>
      <description>Is it possible to define a coefficient of correlation which is (a) as simple
as the classical coefficients like Pearson&amp;#39;s correlation or Spearman&amp;#39;s
correlation, and yet (b) consistently estimates some simple and interpretable
measure of the degree of dependence between the variables, which is 0 if and
only if the variables are independent and 1 if and only if one is a measurable
function of the other, and (c) has a simple asymptotic theory under the
hypothesis of independence, like the classical coefficients? This article
answers this question in the affirmative, by producing such a coefficient. No
assumptions are needed on the distributions of the variables. There are several
coefficients in the literature that converge to 0 if and only if the variables
are independent, but none that satisfy any of the other properties mentioned
above.</description>
