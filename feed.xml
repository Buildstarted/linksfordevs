      <title>Why Is Warner Brothers Discovery Dumping Old Movies On YouTube?
    </title>
      <link>https://tedium.co/2025/02/05/warner-bros-youtube-full-movie-releases/</link>
      <description>A major studio is apparently treating YouTube as a place to drop some of its archive films that have lost their cinematic luster. My mind is admittedly blown.

      <link>https://strongly-typed-thoughts.net/blog/zig-2025</link>
      <description>Ah, Zig. I have a love-hate relationship with this one. A “new” (reading: appeared a couple years ago,
already — yes, already), language with high ambitions. Zig was made to run at low-level, with a simple design
to solve many problems C has (macros, allocators, error handling, more powerful types like baked-in tagged
unions and bitsets, a better build system, no hidden control flow, etc.). The language claims to be the C
successor, and today, many people claim that Zig is simpler and even safer than most languages out there —
even Rust! — allowing to focus more on the technical challenges around your problem space rather
than — quoting from the Zig mantra — your language knowledge. I think I need to put the full mantra
because I will reuse it through this article:</description>

      <title>Many-to-Many Made Easy: Mastering Relationships in EF Core - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/many-to-many-made-easy-mastering-relationships-in-ef-core/</link>
      <description>Remember when dealing with many-to-many relationships in Entity Framework felt like trying to assemble IKEA furniture without instructions? You needed an extra join entity and sometimes a sprinkle of luck to get it all working. EF Core has come to the rescue, making many-to-many relationships as easy as pie (or a fully assembled bookshelf) and giving you improved configurations that put you in the driver&amp;#39;s seat.</description>

      <description>Website: https://infosecforactivists.org/
PDF: https://infosecforactivists.org/Infosec_for_Activists.pdf
Introduction America has a strong tradition of activism, dating back to slave revolts and indigenous uprisings even before the founding of the United States. Today, activism in the US remains critical. Street protests are an essential tool that activists use to raise awareness and push for institutional change. That being said, challenging existing power structures carries an element of risk - exposure can lead to harassment, arrest, or doxxing.</description>

      <description>Oracle filed a motion to dismiss in response to Deno’s petition to cancel its “JavaScript” trademark. But instead of addressing the real issue—that JavaScript is an open standard with multiple independent implementations—Oracle is trying to stall the process and sidestep accountability.</description>

      <title>Are Your Public Dotfiles Revealing Too Much?</title>
      <link>https://thoughts.theden.sh/posts/pub-dotfiles-opsec/</link>
      <description>Why is it a Problem? # Committing dotfiles to a public git repository is now pretty common. Oftentimes people include their .bashrc without much thought. However, information in one’s bashrc could potentially leak sensitive information —&amp;#160;for example:
ssh connection aliases that expose server IPs/hostnames, usernames, and potentially private key locations and ciphers AWS account IDs via aliases and functions, for example when a user aliases authentication with ECR —&amp;#160;a basic GitHub search reveals many in the wild A list of installed software on machine, via aliases, completions, functions etc. Absolute paths could reveal the home directory —&amp;#160;exposing the user id name Aliases that leak server information, for example kubectl aliases could reference a cluster name, or namespaces, deployments etc. There could be a lot more examples, but you get the idea.</description>

      <description>The tech hiring process hasn&amp;#39;t changed much in the last decade. Companies still rely on the same formula: resume screening, technical assessments, culture fit interviews, and eventually - if you&amp;#39;re lucky - an offer. Along the way, talented developers waste countless hours on theoretical exercises while companies struggle to evaluate real-world capabilities.</description>

      <link>https://iamevan.me/blog/the-theory-behind-understanding-failure/</link>
      <description>In the last 100 years, there’s been a lot of intense and distributed advancement in technology, and our use of it as a species. As technology advanced, it also brought catastrophic and costly failure. There’s a lot to be learned about the theory behind failure, safety and resiliency, on the back of the events of the 20th century.</description>
