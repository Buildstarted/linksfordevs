      <link>https://dhwthompson.com/2019/my-favourite-git-commit</link>
      <description>I like Git commit messages. Used well, I think they’re one of the most powerful tools available to document a codebase over its lifetime. I’d like to illustrate that by showing you my favourite ever Git commit.</description>

      <title>Jim Scheinman TED Talk: The Amazing true story of Galen Clark, the "Father of Yosemite"</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpccXl_B6Fs</link>
      <description>In this short TED Talk, Jim discusses the true meaning of finding one's passion and leaving one's legacy by weaving in the incredible untold true story of one of the key 'founders' of Yosemite, Galen Clark, an early pioneer and failed entrepreneur, who contracted tuberculosis while mining for gold and was told he had only months to live, yet who lived to 96 and is a key reason that we have the beauty of Yosemite to cherish today.  
Enjoy the journey and celebration of this soft-spoken true American hero, Galen Clark, as we celebrate the 150th Anniversary of Yosemite as National Treasure!</description>

      <title>Primes Demo - Making an 8 Bit pipelined CPU</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxScH_ZQAZA</link>
      <description>I've hit a big milestone in my CPU Build, the core of the processor is complete. There will be a few refinements as I convert more of it over to PCB's but the underlying functionality of the processor is done. 

As a demonstration and test I've implemented the "Sieve of Eratosthenes" it's an efficient prime number finding algorithm. I have two modifications from the simple form of the algorithm, even numbers are skipped entirely and the Sieve is segmented into blocks of 256 values. This prevents large delays between the early smaller primes as it fills in a larger table. 

Read more about the Sieve here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
Or Eratosthenes himself here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes

The "instructions per cycle" I give in the video is approximate, I'll build some hardware for measuring it more precisely in the future but it's inline with expectations. There is a larger table of processors for comparison here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_second

That bit where I say "the last few evenings" may have been a gross understatement.</description>

      <title>Firecracker</title>
      <link>https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/</link>
      <description>Until now, you needed to choose between containers with fast startup times and high density, or VMs with strong hardware-virtualization-based security and workload isolation. With Firecracker, you no longer have to choose. Firecracker enables you to deploy workloads in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which provide enhanced security and workload isolation over traditional VMs, while enabling the speed and resource efficiency of containers. Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to improve the customer experience of services like AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate.</description>
