      <title>Working with Sass in an ASP.NET Core application</title>
      <link>https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/367/working-with-sass-in-an-asp-net-core-application</link>
      <description>Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a is a scripting language that is used to generate cascading style sheets (CSS files). Its syntax is very 
            similar to CSS itself, but it supports the use of variables, nesting, mixins and selector inheritance, none of which are available in CSS itself.  
		However, these features help you to organise and manitain your web 
		application&amp;#39;s styles. In this article, I look at the steps required to incorporate and configure Sass in your ASP.NET Core project in both Visual Studio, and VS Code.</description>

      <title>.NET Rocks! Continuous Feedback with Roni Dover</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1842</link>
      <description>How do you know the code you write is being used in production? Carl and Richard talk to Roni Dover about his work with Digma to help bring code utilization into your development tooling. Roni talks about the challenges of getting and using production telemetry - often, it never reaches developers. But with OpenTelemetry, there&amp;#39;s a lot of data out there; the challenge is to present it helpfully - and that&amp;#39;s what Digma is all about. It&amp;#39;s still in beta, but sign up if you want to get involved!</description>

      <title>Why did Prolog lose steam?</title>
      <link>https://www.kmjn.org/notes/prolog_lost_steam.html</link>
      <description>An article making the rounds, &amp;quot;Who Killed
Prolog?&amp;quot;, asks: of the major programming traditions—imperative,
functional, object-oriented, and logic—why did the logic-programming one,
exemplified by Prolog, more or less die (to overstate its death a little)? The
author, prominent Prolog veteran Maarten van Emden, traces it back to a large
Japanese-government project, &amp;quot;Fifth-Generation Computer System&amp;quot;, active from
1982 to 1992, which could&amp;#39;ve been Prolog&amp;#39;s killer app, but instead failed and
took Prolog down with it.  I don&amp;#39;t doubt that history might have been different
if a few large Prolog projects in the 1980s turned out differently, and this
one in particular might be key. But with all due respect, I think a larger
reason for Prolog gradually losing steam is that its uniqueness as a
declarative language has been chipped away.</description>

The firmware image was about 21MB and took 11 days to send it over-the-air (or in this case, over-the-vacuum: Mars is currently 242 million kilometres from Earth).</description>

      <title>Where&amp;#39;s my feedback loop?</title>
      <link>https://www.felipehummel.com/wheres-my-feedback-loop/</link>
      <description>It was the end of 2019, and I had been a manager for just over a year. I was leading a small team, with fewer than 15 people. We were well-oiled and functioning smoothly, but there was one feature that customers kept complaining about, and it was way way down</description>

      <title>Simplifying B&amp;#233;zier paths</title>
      <link>https://raphlinus.github.io/curves/2023/04/18/bezpath-simplify.html</link>
      <description>Finding the optimal B&amp;#233;zier path to fit some source curve is, surprisingly, not yet a completely solved problem. Previous posts have given good solutions for specific instances: Fitting cubic B&amp;#233;zier curves primarily addressed Euler spirals (which are very smooth), while Parallel curves of cubic B&amp;#233;ziers rendered parallel curves. In this post, I describe refinements of the ideas to solve the much more general problem of simplifying arbitrary paths. Along with the theoretical ideas, a reasonably solid implementation is landing in kurbo, a Rust library for 2D shapes.</description>
