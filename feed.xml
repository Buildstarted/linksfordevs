      <title>On .NET Live - Operationalizing ML models with ONNX, C# .... and Pokemon!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBWqK-mDWSU</link>
      <description>ONNX defines a common set of operators and a common file format to enable AI developers to use models with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers.

In this live session, Cassie Breviu shows us how we can reuse existing machine learning models using .NET and ONNX. We&amp;#39;ll actually use a model that can classify wine quality based on the description from a wine magazine!

      <title>A Type of Useless</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-type-of-useless</link>
      <description>TypeScript offers certain advantages over JavaScript. Compile time type-checking can catch a lot of errors, it can move faster than browsers, so it offers the latest standards (and the compiler handles the nasty details of shimming them into browsers), plus it has a layer of convenient, syntactic sugar.

If you’re using TypeScript, you can use the compiler to find all sorts of ugly problems with your code, and all you need to do is turn the right flags on.

      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip293.html</link>
      <description>Artificial Intelligence enables you to creates smart applications that go beyond simple forms-over-data. Azure Cognitive Services (opens new window) is a family of APIs that provide AI capabilities out-of-the-box, without the need to create algorithms and train them with massive amounts of data. There are Cognitive Services that translate text into another language or synthesize text to speech, others that recognize faces and objects in images and many more.</description>
