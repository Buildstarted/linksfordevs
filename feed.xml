      <title>On my resignation as regulator of the Dutch intelligence and security services - Bert Hubert&amp;#39;s writings</title>
      <link>https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/resignation-as-intelligence-regulator/</link>
      <description>I’ve seen some mediocre automated translations of my Dutch language resignation statement go round. To prevent any confusion, please find the story here in English:
Until today I was one of the three members of the board that checks warrants for the Dutch intelligence and security services. This board is called “Toetsingscommissie Inzet Bevoegdheden” or TIB.
If either of the civil or the military intelligence and security services of The Netherlands want to use their lawful intercept, SIGINT or hacking (&amp;amp; some other) legal powers, they have to first convince their own jurists, then their ministry and finally the TIB.</description>

      <title>Being Opinionated for the Sake of Dialectics</title>
      <link>https://verzettelung.com/2022/09/08/</link>
      <description>I don&amp;#39;t consider myself opinionated, actually quite the opposite.
Often good arguments can be found for and against the same position and if you commit to one side too early, you may look pretty dumb in hindsight.
Most problems worth thinking about, by their very nature, cannot be solved by armchair science alone. 
You need to collect evidence, make inferences, maybe come up with a simplified model that represents only some aspects of reality.
There is ample opportunity for errors on each step of the way and even in the absence of errors, any new evidence has the potential to turn the tables.
Claiming to know the truth feels presumptuous.</description>
