      <title>Stay Out Of My (Project) $HOME</title>
      <link>https://jackson.dev/post/stay-out-of-my-project-home/</link>
      <description>Warning, I‚Äôm about to get on my mild OCD soapbox again.
Too many development tools expect to get the privilege of a config file in the root directory of my projects. Many of them don‚Äôt even allow it to be a hidden file‚Äîthey just require a fully unhidden ‚Äútool.yml‚Äù file sitting right there in the root of your project.
Stop it. Please.
Linux HOME Directory Link to heading Once upon a time this was a serious problem for organizing files in the Linux HOME directory too. Tools thought way too much of themselves and added files, directories, etc. to your HOME folder. A lot of them still do!</description>

      <title>Debouncing API Calls</title>
      <link>https://thomascountz.com/2025/07/02/debouncing-api-calls</link>
      <description>Debounce Delay: 500ms Hardware The term ‚Äúdebouncing‚Äù originates from electronics (at least that‚Äôs where I first came across it). When you press a physical button or flip a switch, its metal contacts don‚Äôt connect cleanly just once; they ‚Äúbounce,‚Äù opening and closing rapidly, creating multiple pulses of current as the circuit connects and disconnects. Although this happens on the order of milliseconds, filtering the rapid switching is necessary to prevent other components from misinterpreting the bounces as intentional signals. Debouncing in hardware ensures that only a single, clean signal is sent when the button is pressed. Software In software, we hit this same problem. Take search bars, for example. They often fire off an API call on every keystroke to give search results to users with broken enter keys. With a typing speed of around 200 characters-per-minute (3.33 characters-per-second), a user searching for ‚Äúparachute pants‚Äù could trigger 16 API calls in about 5 seconds‚Äîand that‚Äôs assuming they don‚Äôt make any typos. We can‚Äôt possibly know which of those 16 API calls actually improve the user experience, but if I had to guess, search suggestions are most effective when presented after a natural pause in typing‚Äînot during every keystroke. Debouncing with Delays This debounce function uses setTimeout to delay the execution of a callback. function debounce(callback, delay) { let timerId; return (...args) =&gt; { clearTimeout(timerId); timerId = setTimeout(() =&gt; { callback(...args); }, delay); }; } If the returned function gets called again before the timer finishes, it clears the previous timer and starts a new one. This resets the wait time and prevents callbacks from executing until there has been a pause in calls for the specified delay. This is exactly what the demo above does. It waits for you to stop typing for a set number of milliseconds before updating the output field with your input. Delays and Cancellations For input-triggered API calls (like the search bar example) we can take this further by combining debouncing with request cancellation. When the user stops typing in the search bar, the app waits until after a delay (similar to our earlier debounce implementation) before making an API call to fetch search suggestions. If, however, the user begins typing again before the fetch resolves, we need a way to throw away the request. This is because, by the time we would receive a response, the user has already moved on and started searching for something else. So, before making any new API requests, we first cancel the previous fetch, using the AbortController API. function debouncedFetch(delay) { let timerId; let controller; return (...args) =&gt; { clearTimeout(timerId); if (controller) { controller.abort(); } controller = new AbortController(); const signal = controller.signal; timerId = setTimeout(async () =&gt; { const response = await fetch(`https://example.com`, { signal: controller.signal }); // Handle the response here }, delay); }; } This debouncedFetch function works in three steps. First, it clears any pending timer and cancels any in-flight request. If there‚Äôs no previous request (like on the first call), the latter step is skipped. Then, it creates a new AbortController and extracts its signal. This signal acts like a remote control that can cancel the upcoming fetch request at any time. This works because the fetch API supports aborting requests using an AbortSignal. Finally, it starts a new timer. When the timer expires, it calls fetch. And when fetch resolves, we handle the response as needed. So, as before, if the user types again before the timer expires, the timer is restarted before a new fetch request is made. In addition to this, if the user types again while the previous fetch is still in progress, that request is cancelled, the new input is debounced, and then finally, a new fetch request is made with the latest input.</description>

      <title>I‚Äôve Got Better Things To Do Than This, and Yet</title>
      <link>https://lmnt.me/blog/ive-got-better-things-to-do-than-this-and-yet.html</link>
      <description>Last week, when I posted my Finder icon suggestion on Mastodon, I mentioned how I don‚Äôt really like spending my time talking about this kind of stuff. To clarify, I don‚Äôt like doing it when I have other things I would much rather be doing. Lately, I have an abundance of things I want to make, so spending any amount of time whining about Liquid Glass feels‚Ä¶ bad. It just feels bad.</description>

      <title>This Overly Long Variable Name Could Have Been a Comment | Jonathan's Blog</title>
      <link>https://jonathan-frere.com/posts/names-vs-comments/</link>
      <description>Here‚Äôs a belief I‚Äôve held for a while but only recently been able to put into words: explanatory comments are often easier to understand than explanatory variable or function names.
Consider a complicated expression with multiple sub-expressions. This expression is going to be difficult for the next person reading this code to decipher; we should make it easier for them.
There are a couple of ways to solve this. We could break down the expression into sub-expressions, and assign those sub-expressions to intermediate variables. Or we could pull the expression out into its own dedicated function. In each case, the goal is to give either part or all of the expression a dedicated name. This name helps the next reader to understand the purpose or meaning of the expression.</description>
