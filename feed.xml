      <title>System.Linq.Async is part of .NET 10 - LINQ for IAsyncEnumerable</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/e40aaedc-9e56-491f-9fe5-3bb0b162ae94</link>
      <description>IAsyncEnumerable is a type that was introduced in netcoreapp3.1 times. While somewhat an enumerable (even though async in nature), it never had the capabilities as its synchronous counterpart. Until dotnet 10! Now we have some feature-parity between those two.

      <description>A choice isn’t just about where it takes you immediately. It&amp;#39;s about the choices you get to make thereafter. The best choice is usually the one that opens the greatest number of promising branches (not just the one tied to a single, seemingly perfect outcome).</description>

      <title>Four Years of Jai</title>
      <link>https://smarimccarthy.is/posts/2024-12-02-four-years-of-jai/</link>
      <description>I’ve been programming for long enough to be righteously cantankerous about a lot of things. The list of languages, frameworks and libraries I’ve worked with professionally or on personal projects is too long to list – but it includes everything from C and assembly languages through C++, Pascal and Delphi, through Java and Clojure, through Perl, PHP, Python, Javascript, Typescript and so on. I’ve tinkered with Rust, APL, Uiua, Erlang and Haskell.</description>

      <title>The ESP32 &amp;quot;backdoor&amp;quot; that wasn&amp;#39;t | Dark Mentor LLC</title>
      <link>https://darkmentor.com/blog/esp32_non-backdoor/</link>
      <description>This post refutes the claim that researchers found a &amp;quot;backdoor&amp;quot; in ESP32 Bluetooth chips. What the researchers highlight (vendor-specific HCI commands to read &amp;amp; write controller memory) is a common design pattern found in other Bluetooth chips from other vendors as well, such as Broadcom, Cypress, and Texas Instruments. Vendor-specific commands in Bluetooth effectively constitute a &amp;quot;private API&amp;quot;, and a company&amp;#39;s choice to not publicly document their private API does not constitute a &amp;quot;backdoor&amp;quot;.</description>
