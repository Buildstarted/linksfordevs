      <title>A Personal Note From Our Founder – Hindenburg Research</title>
      <link>https://hindenburgresearch.com/gratitude/</link>
      <description>As I’ve shared with family, friends and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research. The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.</description>

      <description>I think about music in years. 2024 was the first year in a long time that I didn&amp;#39;t have anything to do with Spotify Wrapped, but that was never why I thought about music in years, and certainly never how. I like my music data to tell me stories about music not about graphic design, and in verifiable numbers not templated snarkiness. I want to stand at the end of one year and the brink of another and think clearly about how I&amp;#39;ve been listening, and thus living, and expansively about how I might.</description>

      <title>Beating cuBLAS in Single-Precision General Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://salykova.github.io/sgemm-gpu</link>
      <description>In this blog post, we’ll walk through an implementation of the SGEMM (Single-precision GEneral Matrix Multiply) operation defined as C := alpha*A*B + beta*C. We will review three different kernels, each optimized for specific matrix size problems. Our final implementation is optimized for Ampere architecture and outperforms cuBLAS on wide range of matrix size problems.</description>

      <title>Real Semantic Versioning</title>
      <link>https://kidger.site/thoughts/real-sem-ver/</link>
      <description>Semantic version (SemVer) is possibly the most widely used software versioning scheme.
We all know how SemVer works: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. The first number is for backward-incompatible changes, the middle number is for backward-compatible new features, and the last number is for backward-compatible bugfixes.
…it’s a shame how infrequently it actually seems to be used this way!
Backward incompatible changes on minor versions happen all the time. By far the most common example are deprecations, even amongst libraries that claim to follow SemVer.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial we’ll step-by-step optimize multi-threaded FP32 matrix multiplication on CPU outperforming OpenBLAS on wide range of matrix sizes. The algorithm follows the BLIS design and is implemented in simple, scalable C code parallelized with OpenMP. Tags: High-performance GEMM on CPU. Fast SGEMM in C.

      <link>https://louisabraham.github.io/articles/cached-stubs</link>
      <description>Imagine you have just written a complex piece of code (maybe an agent?) that interacts with several APIs and possibly uses large language models (LLMs). Now, you want to write tests but calling the APIs or LLMs during tests would make them slow, non-deterministic, and dependent on network availability.</description>
