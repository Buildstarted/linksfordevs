      <title>The IBM 1401 compiles and runs FORTRAN II</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFQ3sajIdaM</link>
      <description>We attempt to compile and run a simple FORTRAN program on our vintage 1959 IBM mainframe computer at the Computer History Museum. FORTRAN is a big stretch for this business oriented machine, with 16k memory and a CPU not meant at all for  scientific applications. Even integer multiply and divide instructions are  an optional feature on the base machine!  Success not guaranteed.

Files and more details on my website: https://www.curiousmarc.com/computing/ibm-1401
Mike Albaugh has made a page that explains how to run the same demonstration in the SIMH simulation: http://nulli.us/f1401/package.html

      <title>Godot Engine - Godot 4.0 will get a new, modernized lightmapper</title>

      <description>In most game engines, a lightmap is baked for a whole scene and there is only one of it at the same time. In Godot, different scenes can have their own ligthmaps and you can mix and match them however you like.</description>

      <description>A lot of times when you see someone report some result about
hashing, you have to wonder if they've even picked the optimal
form of hashing to try to improve (see, for instance, results
about Robin Hood hashing).</description>

      <title>Alternatives to PGP</title>
      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/502/alternatives-to-pgp/</link>
      <description>As part of my book's chapter on end-to-end encryption I've been writing about the horrors of PGP.
As a recap of what's bad with PGP:

No authenticated encryption. This is my biggest issue with PGP personally.
Receiving a signed message means nothing about who sent it to you (see picture below).
Usability issues with GnuPG (the main implementation).
Discoverability of public keys issue.
Bad integra ...</description>
