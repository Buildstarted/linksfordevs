      <title>Building Realtime applications on Angular with ASPNET Core and SignalR</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/realtime-apps-on-angular-with-aspnetcore-and-signalr/</link>
      <description>This article shows you how to build realtime applications on Angular with ASP.NET Core and SignalR. To get started you need to create an ASP.NET Core application and configure SignalR hub in that. I am using a Web API application. You can do this by dotnet new webapi command. Once it is created, you need to create a Hub - which the one of the core components in the SignalR framework. Here is the Hub implementation.</description>

      <title>I don&amp;#39;t want to do front-end anymore</title>
      <link>https://www.askonomm.com/blog/i-dont-want-to-do-frontend-anymore</link>
      <description>I started coding when I was 14, around 2007 or so. The very first thing I wrote was HTML, then CSS. I liked
making stupid little web pages containing youtube embeds and guest books (anyone remembers those?) full of
marquees, blinks
and gifs. Lots of gifs. The pages were very simple, but joyful to make and also to use. At the time I had no idea that
you could make any money with making web pages, I simply thought it was a silly hobby people could have.</description>

      <title>Monitor Azure WebJobs status with Azure Application Insights</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/monitor-azure-webjobs-status-with-application-insights/</link>
      <description>This article shows you how to monitor Azure WebJobs using Azure Application Insights. WebJobs is a feature of Azure App Service that enables you to run a program or script in the same instance as a web app, API app, or mobile app. There is no additional cost to use WebJobs. If you’re using Azure WebJobs monitoring WebJobs is little hard. You might need to login into Kudu and need to check the status. Recently I had to implement a solution which helps me to monitor Azure WebJobs. Basically by monitoring Web Jobs I wanted to verify whether the service is able to complete the operation successfully or it is still running or it is failed. In this post I am using Azure Application Insights and Kudu REST API to monitor the availability of the Web Jobs. You will be using the Availability feature of Application Insights with the help of MultiStep tests.</description>

      <title>Improving HTTP with structured header fields</title>
      <link>https://www.fastly.com/blog/improve-http-structured-headers</link>
      <description>The HTTP community has been busy modernizing the web’s protocol over the last decade, with multiple revisions of the core specification, a number of extensions, HTTP/2, and now HTTP/3. Unfortunately, the way we define and use HTTP header fields hasn’t changed much since the beginning, with underspecified headers (and lots of different ways to handle them) causing interoperability issues, developer pain, and even security problems. But help is coming.</description>

      <title>Structured Field Values for HTTP</title>
      <link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941.html</link>
      <description>This document describes a set of data types and associated algorithms
      that are intended to make it easier and safer to define and handle HTTP
      header and trailer fields, known as &amp;quot;Structured Fields&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Structured
      Headers&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Structured Trailers&amp;quot;. It is intended for use by
      specifications of new HTTP fields that wish to use a common syntax that
      is more restrictive than traditional HTTP field values.</description>
