      <link>https://jasonkerwin.com/nonparibus/2021/11/03/nothing-scales/</link>
      <description>I recently posted a working paper where we argue that appointments can substitute for financial commitment devices. I’m pretty proud of this paper: it uses a meticulously-designed experiment to show the key result, and the empirical work is very careful and was all pre-specified. We apply the latest and best practices in selecting controls and … Continue reading &amp;quot;Nothing Scales&amp;quot;</description>

      <title>I will pay you cash to delete your npm module</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2021/11/16/Cash-for-leftpad.html</link>
      <description>npm’s culture presents a major problem for global software security. It’s
grossly irresponsible to let dependency trees grow to thousands of dependencies,
from vendors you may have never heard of and likely have not critically
evaluated, to solve trivial tasks which could have been done from scratch in
mere seconds, or, if properly considered, might not even be needed in the first
place.</description>

      <title>The Many Uses of Schedulers</title>
      <link>https://eruhinim.com/post/many-uses-of-schedulers/</link>
      <description>Let’s say you don’t have unlimited resources. Be it RAM, access to files, CPU slots, whatever you can think of. And then you have multiple workloads that will need said resources. That’s where scheduling comes in. Scheduling comes in MANY shapes and sizes including ones you haven’t even suspected of.
Scheduler types Here we explore the various scheduler algorithms that deal with scheduling tasks. Keep in mind I also tried to unify the terminology used so a task forms a unit of work that scheduler schedules.</description>

      <title>What is Babel? &amp;#183; Karl Tarvas</title>
      <link>https://www.karltarvas.com/2021/10/16/what-is-babel.html</link>
      <description>Babel is a common part of many frontend build pipelines. But what is it, and what would you use it for? To answer that question, let’s first take a step back and talk about web browsers and Javascript. Modern Javascript has learned many tricks in the recent years (such as nullish coalescing, template literals, default parameters, and many more). These new language features often allow the developer to write code that’s either more robust, or shorter, or easier to reason about, or all of the above. Alas, many of your users may be using an older browser that was released before these features made it into the language spec. What’s a developer to do?</description>

It asks implementers to make addresses in the prior loopback range 127.1.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 fully usable for unicast use on the Internet.</description>

      <title>Bramble: A Purely Functional Build System and Package Manager</title>
      <link>https://maxmcd.com/posts/bramble/</link>
      <description>About a year and a half ago I decided to start working on a build system inspired by Nix called Bramble. Andrew Chambers had launched hermes and I was messing around with starlark-go a bit and it seemed like writing a Nix-inspired functional build system with Starlark would be a nice way to better understand how they work.
Bramble is no longer a test project, and has matured into something that I think has a few interesting ideas worth sharing.</description>
