      <title>Press release: Use of Google Analytics for web analytics</title>
      <link>https://www.datatilsynet.dk/english/google-analytics/use-of-google-analytics-for-web-analytics</link>
      <description>The Danish Data Protection Agency has looked into the tool Google Analytics, its settings, and the terms under which the tool is provided. On the basis of this review, the Danish Data Protection Agency concludes that the tool cannot, without more, be used lawfully. Lawful use requires the implementation of supplementary measures in addition to the settings provided by Google.</description>

      <title>AWS vs GCP reliability is wildly different</title>
      <link>https://freeman.vc/notes/aws-vs-gcp-reliability-is-wildly-different</link>
      <description>Cloud compute is usually seen as an ethereal resource. You launch VMs and spin them down, billed to the second. The billing and the mental model make it seem like these resources are limitless. That&amp;#39;s typically one of the selling points versus on-prem compute. They can scale responsively to your load so you&amp;#39;re not paying for excess compute that you don&amp;#39;t need but it&amp;#39;s there when you want it.</description>

      <description>There have been discussions in the aftermath of the log4j vulnerability about whether or not open source is broken or sustainable, what we can do to improve the sustainability of the open source ecosystem moving forwards, and the entitlement of users and companies in expecting maintainers to fix their problems.</description>

      <title>Spellcheckers exfiltrating PII… not so fast  ::  Aaron Gustafson</title>
      <link>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/spellcheckers-exfiltrating-pii_-not-so-fast/</link>
      <description>A recent post from the Otto JS research team highlighted how spellcheck services can inadvertently exfiltrate sensitive user data, including passwords, from your site. To be honest, I found the post a tad alarmist and lacking when it came to recommending solid protections. Consider this your no-nonsense guide to protecting your users’ sensitive information.</description>

      <title>Alfred, or &amp;quot;How to super-charge your Mac and automate routine tasks&amp;quot;</title>
      <link>https://blev.dev/articles/alfred/</link>
      <description>I’ve been reading The Productive Programmer for a book club and it’s put me on a productivity binge. It’s an older book and many of its recommendations no longer apply, so I got excited when, while researching modern alternatives for some of the tools the author recommends, I happened to stumble on Alfred. Alfred is a replacement for the Mac spotlight that has already changed how I work. In fact, I was so excited by Alfred that within ten minutes of downloading, I immediately bought a “mega-supporter” license!</description>

      <title>Branchable MySQL: Managing multiple dev environments</title>
      <link>https://mliezun.github.io/2022/09/20/branchable-mysql.html</link>
      <description>When teams start to grow, having a single dev environment becomes an issue. People start stepping on each others toes.
A common problem is that two people want to apply incompatible migrations on the database. That problem is impossible 
to fix if folks are working on parallel branches.
If we can have a database for each branch of a project, that will remove much of the pain of having multiple devs applying
changes to the db.</description>

      <title>Renaming Our Company Revealed a Critical Bug</title>
      <link>https://alic.dev/blog/renaming.html</link>
      <description>TL;DR: Our game had a bug that would erase all save files, 
					whenever the file path of the local storage directory contained the character &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;.
					If your Windows username contained an &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;, your data would be gone. Luckily
					renaming our company to one containing an &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; revealed my mistake

      <description>This is a small story about how memory operates in your .NET application. Well not only .NET but how memory does or does not get allocated.
We will see how a 1 Gigabyte big array is only a few megabytes big to some extend. Furthermore I will discuss working set and committed memory.

      <description>Fan grills are a component in a computer that is often underestimated in terms of their contribution to both system noise and airflow. Most often, grills are chosen based on aesthetics with only a small thought towards performance. In this article, we will be examining nine different grills to determine the effects of grill design on both noise and airflow.</description>

      <title>Open Web Search – Promoting Europe&amp;#39;s Independence in Web Search – Funded by the Horizon Europe Programme</title>
      <link>https://openwebsearch.eu/</link>
      <description>Despite being a backbone of our digital economy, web search is dominated by a few big tech gatekeepers. Thus, information as public good, with free, unbiased and transparent access is not under public control anymore. This imbalance of the search engine marketendangers democracy and limits the innovative potential of Europe’s research landscape and economy.</description>

      <title>TODO: Post an Article</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/todo-post-an-article</link>
      <description>Yesterday, I briefly mentioned the &amp;quot;TODO&amp;quot; comment as part of the WTF. Anyone who develops software for long enough is going to develop some pet peeves. Lord knows, my feelings on Hungarian Notation are well established. Or ternaries, though honestly, for ternaries, I mostly am in it for the puns.
But, I&amp;#39;ve got another pet peeve that&amp;#39;s crawling up my butt far enough that I felt the need to do a soapbox about it.
