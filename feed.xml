      <title>Microsoft: Rust Is the Industry’s ‘Best Chance’ at Safe Systems Programming – The New Stack</title>
      <link>https://thenewstack.io/microsoft-rust-is-the-industrys-best-chance-at-safe-systems-programming/</link>
      <description>Microsoft has deemed C++ no longer acceptable for writing mission-critical software. The industry sorely needs to move to a performant, memory-safe language for its low-low system work. And the best choice on the market today is Rust, Levick said.</description>

      <description>If you're using the Static File Provider in ASP.NET Core you might need to add some additional extensions that are not handled by default. For example, if you host a Blazor site in your own application an additional mime mapping for `.dll` is required. Here how you can map extra extensions to the Static File middleware.</description>

      <link>https://alexmoney.blog/posts/why-credit-scores-dont-matter/</link>
      <description>People who don’t use credit don’t need credit scores! It’s that simple. The credit card industry uses scare tactics to convince you that you can’t live without their stupid score. The truth is you don’t need one.
Credit scores are how banks have bullied and brainwashed Americans into using more and more credit, going deeper and deeper into debt. And it’s worked. The average American has $10,000 in credit card debt and worries about their credit score.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Nix</title>
      <link>https://blog.ojizero.tech/posts/getting-started-with-nix/</link>
      <description>Nix, the purely functional package manager.
 The Nix package manager has been, on and off, on my radar for a couple of years now, the premise of it, using “functional programing”-esque behaviours in order to create a reproducible package management, seemed very intriguing! I mean you know, it has to be cool because it has purely functional in its tagline! This post is a beginning of a group of posts as I experiment and play around with Nix, partially inspired (and tagged under the same name) by this ongoing playlist from Shopify’s Burke Libbey, who’s videos reignited my interest in Nix, enough to starts attempting to move to solely using it!</description>

      <link>https://smaslennikov.com/blog/2020/06/12/dependence/</link>
      <description>Today’s innovations and progress swoop humanity into a neat cycle of anticipation and acquisition through deceptive notions that guide it to dependence. We’re sold on products and ideas through questionable but politically acceptable marketing tactics. We buy, pre-order, take out loans, only to supposedly upgrade later to a somehow inferior product.</description>

      <link>https://deniskyashif.com/2020/06/12/introduction-to-bimachines/</link>
      <description>Bimachines are deterministic finite-state devices that represent the class regular string functions and are commonly used for text rewriting. What is fascinating about them is that they process the input text in both directions - from left to right and from right to left which makes them very efficient in practice as they guarantee linear time input processing.</description>
