      <title>Does unsafe undermine Rust's guarantees?</title>
      <link>https://steveklabnik.com/writing/does-unsafe-undermine-rusts-guarantees/</link>
      <description>When people first hear about unsafe in Rust, they often have questions. A very
normal thing to ask is, ‚Äúwait a minute, doesn‚Äôt this defeat the purpose?‚Äù And while
it‚Äôs a perfectly reasonable question, the answer is both straightforward and has a
lot of nuance. So let‚Äôs talk about it.</description>

      <title>.NET Aspire for Mobile Apps?!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=RCIM6qagZ-U</link>
      <description>You probably know about .NET Aspire by now and how great it is for web applications, containers and cloud apps. What if I told you that it can also be VERY useful for mobile app development? Insights in metrics, tracing those HTTP requests and no more fumbling with endpoint addresses? All possible with .NET Aspire!

In this video I will show you how to get started with .NET MAUI and .NET Aspire and how that can make your life a lot easier. I'd love to hear from you if this is something you would want to see supported and if and how its working for you if you decide to try it.

      <title>REST Constraint #2: Why Client-Server Separation is a Game Changer - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/rest-constraint-2-why-client-server-separation-is-a-game-changer/</link>
      <description>The internet as we know it thrives on separation‚Äîspecifically, the separation of clients and servers. It‚Äôs a fundamental principle of REST and a key factor in building scalable, maintainable, and flexible applications. But what exactly does this separation mean, and why does it matter? Let‚Äôs dive into the Client-Server constraint, one of REST‚Äôs six core architectural principles.</description>

      <description>This story is about concurrent data structures in the context of Ruby. The goal here is to demonstrate how true parallelism can be achieved with global mutable state (which at the time of writing, is not supported by built-in Ruby primitives).</description>

      <title>4 Learnings From Load Testing LLMs</title>
      <link>https://blog.christianposta.com/ai/learnings-from-load-testing-llms/</link>
      <description>The way LLMs run in Kubernetes is quite a bit different than running web apps or APIs. Recently I was digging into the benefits of the Inference Extensions for the Kubernetes Gateway API and I needed to generate some load for the backend LLMs I deployed (Llama, Qwen, etc). I ended up building an LLM load generation tool because I thought my use case needed some specific controls over how the test was run. In the end, I think about 90% of what I built was fairly generic for an LLM load test tool and I probably could have just tweaked the last 10% with an existing load tool to do what I needed. Nevertheless there were a few important things I learned about generating load against an LLM. Follow me (@christianposta /in/ceposta) for more thoughts on LLM perf as I will reslease some benchmarking results of running LLM inference workloads on GPUs in Kubernetes.

      <title>Pushing side projects forward with almost no free time</title>
      <link>https://rafaelcamargo.com/blog/pushing-side-projects-forward-with-almost-no-free-time/</link>
      <description>I once heard a programmer call GitHub a graveyard for side projects. Felt kinda unfair to all the folks out there grinding away, making progress day in and day out. But I get it. Getting a project off the ground takes the ability to push forward with something that never seems to fit into your free time. In this post, I share the strategy I have been using to push my side projects forward.</description>

      <description>As I wrote about in February, Ash and I are traveling to Japan for three months (May ‚Üí August). It's a trip I've always wanted to take, and since I'm between work engagements I've been taking some time to prepare.    Three months is a long time to spend in a country you've never visited, and I'm going to go over a few ways we've been preparing.</description>

aspects of the language, but won't be explaining the easy part. If you haven't read the Zig
Language Reference, you might start there. Additionally,
we will also learn the foundational trick for implementing relational model.</description>

      <title>REST Constraint #1: The Power of a Uniform Interface - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/rest-constraint-1-the-power-of-a-uniform-interface/</link>
      <description>A well-designed REST API isn‚Äôt just a random collection of endpoints‚Äîit follows a set of principles that make it predictable, scalable, and easy to use. One of the core constraints of REST is the Uniform Interface. This principle ensures that APIs are structured consistently, reducing complexity for both developers and systems interacting with them.</description>
