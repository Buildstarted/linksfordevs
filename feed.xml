PlaywrightSharp is a .Net library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browsers with a single API. Playwright delivers automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast. On May 2020, Microsoft introduced Playwright - an open-source Node.js library to write cross-browser automation tests - that are fast, reliable and capable.

      <description>For around a year and a half, I’ve been working with a project that was initially written in Vb.Net, but now newer code is written in C#. It’s a great example of how one project can be written in two languages, and code in Vb.net can reference C# and the other way round.</description>

      <description>I am learning C++, and what better way to make the learning stick more stronger than blogging about my journey and experience, especially thinking that the barrier to entry is quite high and there is too much to learn. So, the reason that this post exists is a bit selfish, but I am hoping it will be helpful to some other folks who are going through the same struggles as I am. In this post, I will go over details of what it takes to work with dependencies in C++ and how the compilation and linking process works.</description>

      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/the-problem-with-odoo/</link>
      <description>The history with Odoo started with TinyERP / OpenERP which was a free ERP System. This was a great idea and pioneered the open source ERP environment.
But in the last years the name and the vision changed. Now Odoo provides besides the ERP part also a CRM, CMS, Blogs, Forums, E-commerce (Online-Shops), Timesheet, Project Management, Inventory Management, Recruitment, Spreadsheet, Documents, Email Marketing&amp;amp;hellip;
So in short: Odoo changed from a focus on ERP to an all-in-one solution which seems to cover nearly every application a business needs.</description>
