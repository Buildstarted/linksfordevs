      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgMhLVa_VfA</link>
      <description>In this community standup, we&amp;#39;ll be showing new features around case sensitivity and collations in 5.0. We&amp;#39;ll also provide a glimpse into how these features were designed, and what considerations and constraints guide the EF team - performance, cross-database support, usability and more. Come see how we design EF features under the hood!

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRns0rqPonA</link>
      <description>Stop thinking of horizontal layers and start thinking about vertical slices.  Can you tell what an application does by looking at it&amp;#39;s file structure? What functionality it provides?  Tired of navigating through a pile projects and folders to implement a new feature?  Stop organizing by technical concern and start organizing by features and capabilities.  This means looking at your application in vertical slices rather than horizontal layers

      <description>As I noted some time ago, in the Windows Runtime, objects are represented at the ABI by a pointer to their default interface. The choice of default interface is usually obvious, but on occasion, the non-obvious choice may be better. If your runtime object supports only one interface,</description>

      <description>I was first diagnosed with depression when I was working on a startup in 2007. I went to the doctor, told him I was feeling mild flu symptoms for a couple of months, he asked me a few questions, determined that I had depression, gave my some SSRIs, and sent me home.</description>

      <title>Taming the Tech Giants – jake lazaroff</title>
      <link>https://jake.nyc/words/taming-the-tech-giants/</link>
      <description>Everyone&amp;#39;s angry at the tech industry these days! Tech companies continue to cement their place as some of the most powerful companies in the world, and taking shots at them has become a popular sport. Most recently, Facebook and Twitter suppressed a controversial New York Post article, raising accusations that the social networks are putting their thumbs on the scale of the upcoming election.
    In response, conservatives — led by the President — have set their sights on Section 230, the legislation that protects the right of Internet companies to moderate content. “Repeal Section 230” has become a popular rallying cry from people who believe that large social networks are abusing this ability to enact a political agenda. There’s a lot of rhetoric around “publishers” and “platforms” (the idea being that if you decide to moderate content on your app or website, you should assume legal liability for it) and that Internet companies are breaking the rules by deciding what content to allow.
    Naturally, the left disputes the claim that conservatives are being censored. But we can still analyze the power of gatekeeper platforms even if we disagree about how they&amp;#39;re wielding it.

      <description>Take Uncle Bob&amp;#39;s Clean Architecture and map its correspondences with Gary Bernhardt&amp;#39;s thin imperative shell around a functional core, and you get an understanding of how to cheaply maintain and scale software!

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve worked at a few places that had a large number of Linux boxes.  I&amp;#39;m 
talking about well over a million.  When you have that many cats which 
need herding, sometimes you have to do things to big groups of them at 
once.  Once in a while, you even have to touch all of them at once.</description>
