      <title>A Good Day | Jonathan Verrecchia</title>
      <link>https://verekia.com/good-day/</link>
      <description>Over the past few months I've been rating my days every evening from 0 to 10 by answering the following question: Was it a good day? The definition of a good day varies for everyone, but for me one important aspect of it is being proud of myself. Particularly having had the discipline to tackle important tasks and resist the temptation of destructive instant-gratification.</description>

      <title>Go Fuzz Yourself! Where do I even begin?! – MIKE CURNOW</title>
      <link>https://mikecurnow.com/2020/08/29/go-fuzz-yourself-where-do-i-even-begin/</link>
      <description>For those who are unfamiliar with the term or practice of Fuzz Testing, it’s essentially the combination of testing input validation coupled with stress testing, which is performed by spraying inputs of a target device, application, or system with random and crafted input at high velocity and observing the effects on the target. Use cases can involve testing input forms on a website to ensure it doesn’t accept foreign or script characters or ensuring that IIoT devices are programmed to be functionally robust.</description>

      <title>Follow My Explorations into AWS for .NET Developers</title>
      <link>http://thedatafarm.com/dotnet/aws-for-net-developers/</link>
      <description>Earlier this year, a friend who is a dev advocate for .NET on AWS reached out to me to see if I had any awareness at all about the support Amazon Web Services has for .NET developers and .NET applications. My answer was a definite no. I’m an Azure fan girl and had never even thought about .NET on AWS. When he started rattling off some of what’s available, APIs, tooling and a dedicated team, I was surprised.</description>

      <title>Programming with Proofs for High-assurance Software</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGIlWfnuTKA</link>
      <description>Programming critical systems with proofs, a long-standing goal of computer science, is beginning to come within reach of modern programming languages and proof assistants. I provide a brief overview of recent accomplishments in this space, related to work in the F* proof assistant and Project Everest, one of its flagship applications. Programs developed in F* with proofs of correctness are now deployed in wide variety of settings, ranging from Microsoft Windows and Hyper-V, Microsoft Azure, the Linux kernel, Firefox, mbedTLS, and several others production systems.

      <title>Life is Short</title>
      <link>http://paulgraham.com/vb.html</link>
      <description>Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder
about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining
about its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life was
short if we lived 10 times as long?</description>
