      <title>From Scratch - Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://ym2132.github.io/GenerativeAdversarialNetworks_Goodfellow</link>
      <description>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), discovered by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, were an early method in the area of generative AI. I will focus on image generation as set out in the paper Generative Adversarial Nets1. This paper is the focal point of this blog post, and I will guide you through the implementation of the paper. After reading this I hope you understand GANs better and how to build them.</description>

      <title>The Degradation of the Cinematic Experience</title>
      <link>https://julianyap.com/posts/2024-06-03-1717462692/</link>
      <description>This isn’t one of those rose-colored glasses “back in my day” feelings but a genuine technical explanation of the degradation of the cinematic experience. We focus on the topic of image resolution and the impact that has.
Growing up in the 80’s and 90’s, some of my fondest memories were of going to the cinema to watch a film for the first time on the “big screen”. It was often seen as an event, and as a family, we’d dress up to go and see The Last Emperor (is it just me or has this film been criminally buried over the years?</description>

      <title>How big a deal was the Industrial Revolution?</title>
      <link>https://lukemuehlhauser.com/industrial-revolution/</link>
      <description>Explanatory note: This page grew out of one of my investigations for Open Phil, but then I got fascinated and put a bunch of personal time into elaborating certain parts of it, and it evolved into something that I think is pretty cool, but which would take more work than it’s worth to vet and edit it such that it would be appropriate for Open Phil’s website, so we decided I should just post it here instead as a personal project. Hence, the below doesn’t represent Open Phil’s position on anything, and should be taken merely as my own personal guesses and opinions.</description>

      <title>Alice in Wonderland: Simple Tasks Showing Complete Reasoning Breakdown in State-Of-the-Art Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02061</link>
      <description>Large Language Models (LLMs) are often described as being instances of foundation models - that is, models that transfer strongly across various tasks and conditions in few-show or zero-shot manner, while exhibiting scaling laws that predict function improvement when increasing the pre-training scale. These claims of excelling in different functions and tasks rely on measurements taken across various sets of standardized benchmarks showing high scores for such models. We demonstrate here a dramatic breakdown of function and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art models trained at the largest available scales which claim strong function, using a simple, short, conventional common sense problem formulated in concise natural language, easily solvable by humans. The breakdown is dramatic, as models also express strong overconfidence in their wrong solutions, while providing often non-sensical &amp;quot;reasoning&amp;quot;-like explanations akin to confabulations to justify and backup the validity of their clearly failed responses, making them sound plausible. Various standard interventions in an attempt to get the right solution, like various type of enhanced prompting, or urging the models to reconsider the wrong solutions again by multi step re-evaluation, fail. We take these initial observations to the scientific and technological community to stimulate urgent re-assessment of the claimed capabilities of current generation of LLMs, Such re-assessment also requires common action to create standardized benchmarks that would allow proper detection of such basic reasoning deficits that obviously manage to remain undiscovered by current state-of-the-art evaluation procedures and benchmarks. Code for reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at https://github.com/LAION-AI/AIW</description>

      <title>Why Do Electronic Components Have Such Odd Values? – Digilent Blog</title>
      <link>https://digilent.com/blog/why-do-electronic-components-have-such-odd-values/</link>
      <description>If you’ve been around electronics for a while, you’ve probably noticed that components like resistors, capacitors, zener diodes, and inductors come in some odd values. Looking at the chart below, there seems to be no clear rationale&amp;#160;behind the values, but there is a pattern. 47kΩ resistors and 22μF capacitors are everywhere, but not 40kΩ or 50kΩ resistors, or 20μF or 30μF capacitors. So what’s the deal? It all has to do with preferred numbers.</description>
