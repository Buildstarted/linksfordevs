      <title>A Not So Gentle Introduction to PPO &amp; GRPO</title>
      <link>https://cyrilzakka.github.io/posts/ppo-grpo</link>
      <description>If you’re reading this, I’m stuck on a 9-hour SFO-LHR flight with nothing else to do but munch on some high-calorie snacks and endure a mediocre movie selection. Since I have nothing better to do and have been putting it off for quite some time, I figured now’s as good a time as any to finally do a deep dive on the DeepSeek R1 paper.</description>

      <title>glandium.org » Blog Archive » How I (kind of) killed Mercurial at Mozilla</title>
      <link>https://glandium.org/blog/?p=4346</link>
      <description>Did you hear the news? Firefox development is moving from Mercurial to Git. While the decision is far from being mine, and I was barely involved in the small incremental changes that ultimately led to this decision, I feel I have to take at least some responsibility. And if you are one of those who would rather use Mercurial than Git, you may direct all your ire at me.</description>

      <title>Stephen Kotkin's Hopeful Future for the West - Rik's Weblog</title>
      <link>https://huijzer.xyz/posts/71</link>
      <description>In 2017, Stephen Kotkin gave a 5 hour long talk about Spheres of Influence at the IWM Vienna.
The talk is long not because he repeats the same ideas, but because he doesn't give conclusions.
As I see it, his talks clearly step through both sides of an argument and then leave it up to the audience to decide what to believe; largely in-line with the Socratic method.
One part of the talk stood out to me:
he said that the West does not have a clear hopeful picture for the future anymore.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Branch Predictor Race Conditions – Computer Security Group</title>
      <link>https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/microarch/branch-privilege-injection/</link>
      <description>Branch Privilege Injection (CVE-2024-45332) brings back the full might of branch target injection attacks (Spectre-BTI) on Intel. Intel’s hardware mitigations against these types of attacks have held their ground for almost 6 years. In our work, we demonstrate how these mitigations can be broken due to a race condition in Intel CPUs.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Code Modularity  The Power of Simple Design #programming #coding #dotnet</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=jkb22ALN2lM</link>
      <description>Ports and adapters, clean architecture, hexagonal architecture. Call it whatever you want it doesn't have to mean unneccessary abstractions and misdirection in your code base.

It's simple, it's clean. And it ensures your code stays modular and the application and infrastructure concerns of your application say seperate.

      <title>I Removed MediatR – Building Your Own CQRS Handlers in .NET</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=j1OUToRyVHc</link>
      <description>Get the free Clean Architecture template: https://dub.sh/ca-template
Want to master Clean Architecture? Go here: https://bit.ly/3PupkOJ
Want to unlock Modular Monoliths? Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt

You've probably heard—MediatR is going commercial.

If you're using it in your Clean Architecture template (like I did), it might be time to explore alternatives. In this video, I’ll walk you through a full MediatR-free CQRS implementation using custom `ICommand`, `IQuery`, and handler interfaces.

✅ We’ll cover:
- Why I decided to remove MediatR
- How to build your own CQRS abstractions
- Replacing ISender with explicit handler injection
- Manual DI vs automatic scanning using [Scrutor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Scrutor)
- Fully working Command &amp; Query pipeline without third-party libraries

You'll see how to:
- Refactor a .NET API endpoint from MediatR to your own handler
- Register handlers manually and automatically
- Handle generic result types for commands and queries

👉 Want to skip ahead and use the updated template?
Check the pinned comment for a link to the Clean Architecture template without MediatR.
