      <description>The story of how I started game development is quite unusual, which led me to not using game engines and allowed me to get familiar with alternative tooling.</description>

      <title>Using Claude Code to modernize a 25-year-old kernel driver – Dmitry Brant</title>
      <link>https://dmitrybrant.com/2025/09/07/using-claude-code-to-modernize-a-25-year-old-kernel-driver</link>
      <description>As a bit of background, one of my hobbies is helping people recover data from old tape cartridges, such as QIC-80 tapes, which were a rather popular backup medium in the 1990s among individuals, small businesses, BBS operators, and the like. I have a soft spot for tape media; there’s something about the tactile sensation of holding these tapes in my hands that makes the whole process very joyful, even though QIC tapes are notorious for their many design flaws. With some careful inspection and reconditioning, the data on these tapes is still totally recoverable, even after all these years.</description>

      <title>Ten Years of D3D12</title>
      <link>https://therealmjp.github.io/posts/ten-years-of-d3d12/</link>
      <description>For those of us that have been using it from the start, it can be hard to believe that Direct3D 12 has been around for ten years now. Windows 10 was released on July 29th 2015, and D3D12 has been with us ever since. While it’s true that this is the longest we’ve gone between major D3D version updates, it’s also not fair to say that the API has remained static.</description>

“Don’t worry, we’ll put the company in our name, but you’ll still control it.”

      <title>My Video Production Stack (for YouTube)</title>
      <link>https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/my-video-production-stack/</link>
      <description>There are two barriers to publishing videos on YouTube. The first one is getting over thinking you are cringe and the second one is video editing. You have to battle the first one on your own, but I’m hoping that with what I share below, you can ease the burden of the latter.
No-hands editing, processing and publishing
The goal of this video production stack is to take a raw video, then automatically edit it, transcribe it, come up with timestamped chapter markers for the YouTube description, and upload it to my YouTube channel. Basically this is a fully automatic publishing workflow after the point I hit stop on the record button.</description>

      <title>Juggling multiple SSH_AUTH_SOCKs in tmux – mark shroyer, dot com</title>
      <link>https://markshroyer.com/2025/09/socklink/</link>
      <description>This post is about a portable Unix shell script, socklink.sh, written to
keep SSH_AUTH_SOCK working within a long-running tmux session—even when
switching between multiple clients that have different SSH agents, whether
those clients are simultaneously connected or attaching and detaching over
time.  I also digresses into what I’ve learned from writing and testing a
cross-platform shell script in 2025.</description>

      <link>https://www.nvegater.com/blog/TechExplorations2025</link>
      <description>Been thinking about LLMs as producing shadows rather than understanding - similar to Plato's cave allegory.
The outputs aren't grounded in true comprehension, but they're useful for structuring thoughts and generating starting points.
When code is involved, you can immediately test whether the shadow works in reality.</description>
