      <description>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) has published RFC8890, The Internet is for End Users, arguing that the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) should ground its decisions in whatâ€™s good for people who use the Internet, and that it should take positive steps to achieve that.

      <description>Here's what we need to know to consider your game for the Leftfield Collection at EGX 2020, which is online only, 12th - 20th September. Submissions close on Friday the 28th of August

If selected there's no cost to exhibit, but places are limited. Additionally, there must be some aspect of your project online and playable, preferably embeddable but at least a downloadable demo we can direct people to. This might be on Steam, Itch.io, or another marketplace.

All games and game-like things are welcome. The Leftfield is there to showcase everything from small hobby projects and interactive things, to interesting and beautiful commercial work.

There's a much longer FAQ here (much of which won't apply to an online only event): https://ympt.co.uk/leftfield-collection-faq/

If you have any questions not included in that, discuss with david.hayward@gamer-network.net

Sound good? In that case, we'd like to know this stuff please:</description>

      <title>How do I convert from the C++/WinRT projection type to the C++/WinRT implementation type? | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200828-00/?p=104138</link>
      <description>Last time, we looked at converting from the C++/WinRT implementation type to the corresponding C++/WinRT projection type. Going from the projection back to the implementation is a little trickier and relies on your own vigilance. Thereâ€™s no a priori guarantee that the projected pointer actually refers to your implementation.</description>

Holy crap, google is apparently taking down all/most fediverse apps from google play on the grounds that that some servers in the fediverse engage in hate speech. At least three apps I know of anyway and I'd imagine the others will follow soon under the exact same reasoning.} Seems to be the case with Husky, Fedilab, and "subway" tooter.

this is a scary precedent if google play is going to ban any apps that can in any way be used to access content with hate speech. So what about a forum client, do they take that down just because there is a forum somewhere on the internet posting hate speech?

This is particularly worrisome because for most people Google Play is the only way they understand to install apps at all.

Picture attached of one of the notices received by fedilab.

      <title>Asana S-1 Analysis - Comparing One Productivity Powerhouse to Another by @ttunguz
</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/asana-s-1/</link>
      <description>Asana filed their S-1 this week. Asana builds productivity and task management solutions. When they launched, their vision of eliminating email through task management made big waves in the market. Today, the company is a massively successful SaaS business and another example of the flywheel business model that creates demand at the individual user and leverages that interest to sell department and company-wide contracts.
Asana competes with SmartSheet, another publicly traded productivity company.</description>
