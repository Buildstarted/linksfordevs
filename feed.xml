      <title>Mapping the World with EF Core: Working with Spatial Data - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/mapping-the-world-with-ef-core-working-with-spatial-data/</link>
      <description>Have you ever needed to store coordinates, track locations, or perform distance calculations in your database? Whether you&amp;#39;re building a ride-sharing app, a location-based service, or an interactive map, working with spatial data is essential. Luckily, EF Core supports spatial data types, allowing you to store, query, and manipulate geographic data seamlessly. No more treating latitude and longitude as simple numbers—let’s bring real GIS (Geographic Information System) power to your EF Core apps!</description>

      <description>I figured I’d take some of these AI app builders for a run to see how capable they are. To date I’ve mainly just been taking advantage of the AI capabilities that are progressively being added to VS Code and Visual Studio though tooling such as Copilot but I’m hoping that these AI app builders, ...

      <title>Linear Relationships in the Transformer’s Positional Encoding</title>
      <link>https://blog.timodenk.com/linear-relationships-in-the-transformers-positional-encoding/</link>
      <description>In June 2017,&amp;#160;Vaswani et al. published the paper “Attention Is All You Need” describing the “Transformer” architecture, which is a purely attention based sequence to sequence model. It can be applied to many tasks, such as language translation and text summarization. Since its publication, the paper has been cited more than one thousand times and several excellent blog posts were written on the topic; I recommend&amp;#160;this one.
Vaswani et al. use positional encoding, to inject information about a token’s position within a sentence into the model. The exact definition is written down in section 3.5 of the paper (it is only a tiny aspect of the Transformer, as the red circle in the cover picture of this post indicates). After the definition, the authors state:
“We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset $k$, $PE_{pos+k}$ can be represented as a linear function of $PE_{pos}$.”
But why is that? In this post I prove this linear relationship between relative positions in the Transformer’s positional encoding.</description>

      <title>Managing Project Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://blog.apoorvkh.com/posts/project-dependencies.html</link>
      <description>Context: I am an AI researcher (currently a PhD student) and have been writing Python code for computer vision and NLP projects since 2018. While I actually really enjoy programming, I find writing code for research projects less satisfying and pretty tedious. The latter seems to be a very common sentiment among my peers: we spend a lot more time writing and debugging project boilerplate than actually building experiments! This post (hopefully, of several) begins to share how we can use modern tools in our workflows to both write less code and spend less time debugging.</description>
