      <title>Abusing AWS Lambda to make an Aussie Search Engine</title>
      <link>https://boyter.org/posts/abusing-aws-to-make-a-search-engine/</link>
      <description>TL/DR I wrote an Australian search engine. You can view it at bonzamate.com.au. It’s interesting because it runs its own index, only indexes Australian websites, is written by an Australian for Australians and hosted in Australia. It’s interesting technically because it runs almost entirely serverless using AWS Lambda, and uses bit slice signatures or bloom filters for the index similar to Bing. I also found out the most successful code I have ever written is PHP, despite never being a professional PHP developer.</description>

      <title>10 real-world stories of how we’ve compromised CI/CD pipelines</title>
      <link>https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/01/13/10-real-world-stories-of-how-weve-compromised-ci-cd-pipelines/</link>
      <description>Mainstream appreciation for cyberattacks targeting continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines has been gaining momentum. Attackers and defenders increasingly understand that build pipelines are highly-privileged targets with a substantial attack surface. But what are the potential weak points in a CI/CD pipeline? What does this type of attack look like in practice? NCC Group has found many attack paths through different security assessments that could have led to a compromised CI/CD pipeline in enterprises large and small. In this post, we will share some of our war stories about what we have observed and been able to demonstrate on CI/CD pipeline security assessments, clearly showing why there is the saying, “they are execution engines&amp;quot;</description>

      <link>https://toot.cat/@woozle/107634232290378715</link>
      <description>*crossposted from &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/woozle_tldr-why-isnt-there-a-universal-data-format-activity-6888590321362452480-_0rw&amp;quot;&amp;gt;LinkedIn&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;*

TL;DR: **Why isn&amp;#39;t there a universal data-format for r&amp;#233;sum&amp;#233;s?**

So, here&amp;#39;s a thing.

A lot of job application sites will ask you to upload a r&amp;#233;sum&amp;#233; (henceforth &amp;quot;CV&amp;quot;) and then attempt to parse it out into something more like a set of database entries, presumably with the idea of making it easier for prospective employers to search for people with particular types of experience.

The problem is, the parsing software they all seem to use is hot garbage.

I thought at first it was something to do with my CV&amp;#39;s decorative layout, so I tried creating a new one from scratch that&amp;#39;s laid out with the intention of being minimally confusing for a parsing algorithm. My name and contact info is at the top, then an &amp;quot;Experience&amp;quot; header, followed by sub-headers with the name of each job, with labeled bullet-items under each one which include things like dates worked, tech used, tasks performed, etc.

The algorithm doesn&amp;#39;t seem to do any better with this. It picked two work-experience items seemingly at random (including the oldest one, down at the end of the list), and it got the dates completely wrong for the first one (it showed dates which are not given *anywhere* on my CV; it seems to have completely invented them, for no apparent reason).

Yes, I can go in and manually enter all my work experience -- but I have to do this for every new site where I apply for work, AND -- this is the key thing -- there&amp;#39;s no way to SAVE THAT WORK in a format which I can reload elsewhere.

The larger employers and job-hosting web sites need to get their acts together and work this out. Some kind of XML microformat seems like a good idea to me, though JSON would probably work fine too (though I prefer XML because JSON doesn&amp;#39;t support comments).

Please.</description>
