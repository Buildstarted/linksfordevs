      <title>Rodney Littles II - Is there an echo?</title>
      <link>https://rodneylittlesii.com/posts/topic/foundation-echo-chamber</link>
      <description>When I ran for the .NET Foundation Board, I found it odd that the legacy members were silent.  There was no word from them on the experience.  There was no understanding of their thought on the state of affairs in the .NET Foundation.  There was an election.  We shuffled them out without a word and brought in new board members in total silence.  The silence I heard was loud enough for me to realize the potential problem.  I proceeded anyway, with caution.</description>

      <description>TL-DR version: If you ever change your email address, and you lose access to your old email address, you&amp;#39;ll no longer be able to reset your T-Mobile Money password via email. If you&amp;#39;re not a T-Mobile
Wireless customer, you won&amp;#39;t be able to reset your password via text message either. So, you may lose the ability to reset your password altogether.</description>

      <title>LinkedIn Safety Series: What is scraping?</title>
      <link>https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/july/15/linkedin-safety-series-what-is-scraping</link>
      <description>For our members to have the best possible experience, we want to keep them safe. We work every day to protect our members’ data and their ability to control the information they post on LinkedIn. Our Global Trust Teams create, deploy, and maintain models that detect and prevent abuse, stop attacks, thwart scams and generally limit the bad stuff that exists on the internet from ever reaching our members. Much of the detail on how companies do this has stayed behind the scenes, but we want to peel back the curtain in this first post in a series of safety topics.</description>
