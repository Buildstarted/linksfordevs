      <title>The Barbican</title>
      <link>https://arslan.io/2025/05/12/barbican-estate/</link>
      <description>Three years ago, while searching for Vitsoe setups, I stumbled upon Barbican. I delved deeper and discovered a building complex that was beyond my imaginations.

Young Fatih would definitely find it ugly; current me finds it beautiful. The estate was built between 1965 and 1976. And, since I first saw</description>

      <title>Embeddings are underrated</title>
      <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/ml/embeddings/overview.html</link>
      <description>Machine learning (ML) has the potential to advance the state of the
art in technical writing. No, I‚Äôm not talking about text generation models
like Claude, Gemini, LLaMa, GPT, etc. The ML technology that might end up
having the biggest impact on technical writing is embeddings.</description>

      <title>How I ruined my vacation by reverse engineering WSC</title>
      <link>https://blog.es3n1n.eu/posts/how-i-ruined-my-vacation/</link>
      <description>In this post I will briefly describe the journey I went through while implementing defendnot, a tool that disables Windows Defender by using the Windows Security Center (WSC) service API directly.
Even though this is most likely not what you expected to see here, but rather than going into full technical details on how everything works, I will describe what rabbitholes I went through and how painful everything was due to my ‚ú®special‚ú® environment.</description>

      <title>Alexander Sieradzki - Lights out solver or story about how to solve N^2 equations in O(N^3) time</title>
      <link>https://alexander.sieradzki.dev/posts/Lights_out_blogpost/</link>
      <description>Did you ever need to wake up at 5 am to go to the morning lecture where you are fighting for your life to stay awake and learn anything? Well, I know I did and it was a time when I kept myself focused by playing some logic games in the background. You know logic games like Minesweeper, simple games that once you learn you can solve absentmindedly. One game I kept thinking about over and over is Flip(which is an implementation of ‚ÄúLights Out‚Äù). Computers solve this game by just solving a system of linear equations, but I wanted to find a method that 5 am me could absentmindedly use. Well, I didn‚Äôt find it but I found a way to solve that specific system of equations with much fewer operations. And that different way of solving it is the topic of this blog post.</description>

      <title>Booting the RP2350 from UART</title>
      <link>https://pfister.dev/blog/2025/rp2350-uart-bl.html</link>
      <description>The RP2350 is a nice microcontroller from Raspberry Pi. Recently I thougt about a new project, where a lot of PWM channels would be needed. The RP2350B has 24 PWM channels, which is a lot - but not enough. I would need at least 33 PWM channels, and also some more GPIOs, so the RP2350 alone isn't enough. So I thought about a port expander... But what about using a second RP2350 as a port expander?</description>

      <title>How modern databases keep their cool</title>

      <description>So I've been thinking a lot about database internals the past few weeks. For instance, how do these things actually work under the hood? I mean, we're all writing code that hammers these poor databases with concurrent requests, and somehow they don't explode into a million conflicting pieces. Pretty wild,</description>

      <title>Fitting models from noisy heuristic labels - Emir's blog</title>
      <link>https://emiruz.com/post/2025-05-11-soft-labels/</link>
      <description>I present a weak supervision paradigm called ‚Äúdata programming‚Äù which uses
maximum likelihood estimation to produce soft labels from heuristics. These
soft labels can then be used to train other models, without true labels
being required at any stage. I‚Äôve included a simple example from first
principles to show that the methods work. The original authors have a fully
featured package called Snorkel which
provides sophisticated data programming and related features.</description>

      <title>Chris Henson - Beginner Resources for Formalizing Lambda Calculi</title>
      <link>https://chrishenson.net/posts/2025-05-10-formalized_lambda_calculus.html</link>
      <description>This started as a Twiter reply to @slimjimmy_dev
asking for some resources to help understand my Lean formalization of the
untyped lambda calculusNow that the groundwork is laid I should be able tackle the
categorical semantics of the untyped lambda calculus in Lean next! I claim
no originality for the confluence/progress pieces, they are an amalgamation
of the resources listed in this article., but quickly grew long enough that I decided to
make it into a post. Formalizing metatheory is a topic that is interesting to
beginner and experienced proof assistant users alike, but rife with tricky
technical issues that can dissuade one from making much progress. I hope by
collecting some resources here that I can provide a bit of help to those looking
for where to get started.</description>
