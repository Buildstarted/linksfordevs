      <title>What is OpenTelemetry?</title>
      <link>https://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/what-is-opentelemetry/</link>
      <description>Michael Outlaw is a father, husband, and software developer based out of Atlanta, GA. A fan of gadgets and all things technology, when he isn’t found behind the clickety clack of his favorite mechanical keyboard he’s usually found riding a bicycle on his favorite road or trail systems. A father of two boys, Michael often spends his free time teaching his boys how to lose with dignity as they destroy him in game franchises like Overwatch, Halo, and Call of Duty. When not sharing his love of Git, C#, and unit testing, he can be found spending his “study time” studying the sounds of guitar and music theory.</description>

      <title>SponsorLink: feedback and moving forward</title>
      <link>https://www.cazzulino.com/sponsorlink-feedback.html</link>
      <description>As I mentioned in my introduction post on SponsorLink, open source sustainability is a tricky topic. I have been doing open source for more than 20 years, so I’m not entirely n00b to the space. I don’t believe in “experts” anyway, so I’m just going off of my personal experience, things I read and saw other fellow developers do in the past and so on. So, if it wasn’t clear enough, I’m not speaking for anyone but myself. I don’t represent the “dotnet OSS community”, or speak as to “how OSS should be/is done” or what is “right” or “wrong”...</description>
