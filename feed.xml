      <title>SponsorLink: trying something new-ish for OSS sustainability</title>
      <link>https://www.cazzulino.com/sponsorlink.html</link>
      <description>Open source sustainability is a tricky topic. I would kindly refer you to the thoughtful post by Eric Sink and Six Labors’s license change post. Suffice to say, we all struggle to make this a sustainable proposition where we can dedicate full-time to the projects we love. Also, there doesn’t seem to be a perfect answer for all scenarios, so there’s always pros and cons. With that in mind, let me introduce you to SponsorLink. GitHub Sponsors GitHub Sponsors is a fantastic thing. I’m quite convinced it’s a step in the right direction, with availability throughout most of the world,...</description>

      <title>A WPF Statusbar Control</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2023/Aug/08/A-WPF-Statusbar-Control</link>
      <description>Statusbar controls are boring, but because of the way that they are used there are a number of caveats like ensuring the UI updates even in linear code, allowing for timeouts of status messages and resetting to default, and to provide some visual clues to draw attention to the status messages displayed. In this post I talk about a custom status bar control and helper that make it super easy to use a new status bar control or attach additional functionality to an existing status bar.</description>

      <title>On sound programming: Playing a single note with SDL2</title>
      <link>https://blog.fredrb.com/2023/08/08/audio-programming-note-sdl/</link>
      <description>Playing a single note with SDL2 I have successfully avoided sound programming for all my programming life. Even when I tried making games, sound was always an afterthought. However, recently I got a new pair of headphones, and wondered: “what makes sound good?”, or “how much of the quality can be improved by hardware?”, and even “what is the structure of a sound file?”. If you’re looking for answers to all these questions — sorry, you are in the wrong place.</description>

      <title>DIY Tailscale Funnel | Gabriel&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.gabrielsimmer.com/posts/diy-tailscale-funnel/</link>
      <description>I really do love Tailscale, if it wasn&amp;#39;t obvious by my previous infrastructure update post. When they announced their Funnel feature, I jumped on it as an opportunity to try an alternative to Cloudflare Tunnels. And while it worked pretty well, I was mildly disappointed by some missing features. Key among them being the ability to setup custom DNS entries to point to services. So not only was the URL really long, I also didn&amp;#39;t fully have control over it and I also had to do path routing to various services, which can be finicky at the best of times.</description>

      <title>Efficient Elliptic Curve Arithmetic in OpenSSL — Store Halfword Byte-Reverse Indexed</title>
      <link>https://sthbrx.github.io/blog/2023/08/07/going-out-on-a-limb-efficient-elliptic-curve-arithmetic-in-openssl/</link>
      <description>So I&amp;#39;ve just managed to upstream some changes to OpenSSL for a new strategy I&amp;#39;ve developed for efficient arithmetic used in secp384r1, a curve prescribed by NIST for digital signatures and key exchange. In spite of its prevalence, its implementation in OpenSSL has remained somewhat unoptimised, even as less frequently used curves (P224, P256, P521) each have their own optimisations.</description>

      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2023-08-05_one_year_into_phd/</link>
      <description>I started my PhD program about a year ago. In my first year I have:
Taken 4 “normal” 3-credit-hour classes Participated in 3 seminars Switched advisors Attended 2 conferences (PLDI @ FCRC, JuliaCon) Presented my work at JuliaCon It’s been a lot of work, and there’s been a lot of stress. I’m in a much better place now than when I started, and over all I’m happy where I’m at and where I’m headed.</description>

      <title>Overlooked on HN: Databases That Process Data Faster Than Memory Bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://taras.glek.net/post/overlooked-hn-databases-that-process-data-faster-than-memory-bandwidth/</link>
      <description>13 GiB/s per core!
Sneller posted a blog on HN
 on how they use AVX-512 to decompress data at 13 gigabytes per second per core.
This a fantastic ad for their “lets turn logs on S3 into cheap database” product. This is a solution I wanted multiple times, will definitely consider them next time the need comes up.
Faster than RAM
Now this post did not get overlooked, but what did get overlooked is that the post engaged the clickhouse CTO. He posted a link to a presentation on how Clickhouse uses compression to process in-memory data faster than RAM bandwidth
.
As a result of discussion in these comments, clickhouse might get even faster.</description>

      <title>Go 1.21 Release Notes - The Go Programming Language</title>
      <link>https://go.dev/doc/go1.21</link>
      <description>The latest Go release, version 1.21, arrives six months after Go 1.20.
  Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
  As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of compatibility;
  in fact, Go 1.21 improves upon that promise.
  We expect almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.</description>

      <title>Getting my library cards onto my phone the hard way — iliana.fyi</title>
      <link>https://iliana.fyi/blog/ios-wallet-library-card/</link>
      <description>Our local libraries, The Seattle Public Library and the King County Library System, issue pieces of plastic with barcodes printed on the back assigned to your borrower account. These cards are not strictly necessary in 2023; most everything at Seattle libraries is self-service, including circulation, and these self-service entrypoints usually have a way to type in a library barcode manually. But having the barcode is far more convenient, and I’d like to have it without having to keep yet another plastic card I rarely use in my wallet.</description>
