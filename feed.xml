      <title>How to build a BVH – Part 1: Basics – Jacco’s Blog</title>
      <link>https://jacco.ompf2.com/2022/04/13/how-to-build-a-bvh-part-1-basics/</link>
      <description>In this series we explore the wonderful world of the bounding volume hierarchy: the mysterious data structure that enables real-time ray tracing on recent GPUs, in complex, animated scenes. Despite the broad adoption of ray tracing in games, in-depth understanding of the underlying technology seems to be reserved to a select few. In this article we show how a proper BVH is implemented without support from DXR / RTX / OptiX / Vulkan, in easy-to-read ‘sane C++’. Whether this is actually useful for you, or just interesting as background information, depends on your needs, obviously.</description>

      <title>Azure DevOps Podcast: Mark Seemann: Code That Fits In Your Head - Episode 189</title>
      <link>http://feed.azuredevops.show/mark-seemann-code-that-fits-in-your-head-episode-189</link>
      <description>Mark Seemann is a Danish software developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. His professional interests include functional programming, object-oriented development, as well as software development in general. Apart from writing two books, he has also written numerous articles and blog posts about related topics. Despite being a mostly .NET developer, Mark takes most of his inspiration from sources across a wide range of technologies, including Haskell and lots of pattern books. Originally poised to become a rock star or (failing that) graphic novelist (in the European tradition) he one day found himself with insufficient talent for either, a master&amp;#39;s degree in Economics, and a desire for working with computers. He has been doing the latter intermittently since 1995. &amp;amp;nbsp; Mark is the author of two books so far: Author of  as well as . &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [4:55] Mark talks about the thought process behind writing Code That Fits In Your Head. [10:10] Why doesn’t Mark like software projects? [13:06] Yes, we want to create value for the businesses when we write code, but we also have to have a longer view on things as well. [17:11] Mark shares three of the most things for getting started with a new application. [19:46] Mark walks us through the process of automating a build. [22:42] Most compiler warnings indicate that you have problems with your code. [28:29] What are some of Mark’s resources and pieces of advice for younger programmers? [35:31] In Denmark and Scandinavian cultures, you often feel like the CEO is within close reach and someone that you could easily have lunch with. Mark talks about overcoming resistance in long-time developers when learning something new that may cause some anxiety or insecurity. &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  — New video podcast!

      <description>It&amp;#39;s now mid 2021, and my wife and I have arrived in Dreieich, outside of  Frankfurt, Germany. We took a cab from the airport to the long-term Airbnb rental we&amp;#39;ll be staying in. When I tried to pay for the cab, the driver told me that he doesn&amp;#39;t accept a card...this bears repeating, the airport cab I took doesn&amp;#39;t accept card payment...No worries, there&amp;#39;s an ATM around the corner, and I pay in cash.</description>

      <title>Laurence Tratt: Practising Programming</title>
      <link>https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2022/practising_programming.html</link>
      <description>When we see a world-class musician flawlessly play challenging music, it can be
tempting to imagine that they were always able to do so. A moment&amp;#39;s thought
makes it obvious that they must have had to spend huge amounts of time
practising basic techniques in order to reach that level. What&amp;#39;s less obvious
is that they have to continue spending considerable
amounts of time simply to maintain that technique, let alone expand it.</description>

      <title>Away team work – Sledgeworx Software</title>
      <link>https://www.sledgeworx.io/away-team-work/</link>
      <description>Away team work is a critical component of high performance software organizations. It is a way for high priority teams to work around other teams’ manpower constraints to deliver software. Without a well established culture of away team project work your organization will default to a standard of ‘shut up and wait while your item is in the backlog’.</description>

      <title>Choose Your Cloud Dependencies Wisely</title>
      <link>https://lackofimagination.org/2022/04/choose-your-cloud-dependencies-wisely/</link>
      <description>Vendor lock-in: An unfortunate condition that forces a person or company to continue using a disliked product or service just because they invested in it so much. Vendor lock-in used to affect mostly large companies using mission critical legacy applications, but as more and more companies move to the cloud, cloud providers started to rediscover the joys of vendor lock-in by offering “value-added” services that simplify the lives of software developers who have better things in life than managing servers and databases…</description>

      <title>Fast thinking on lichess.org - Emir&amp;#39;s blog</title>
      <link>https://emiruz.com/post/2022-04-15-lichess1/</link>
      <description>I use lichess.org games data to investigate the extent to which
fast thinking is the dominant factor affecting game outcomes at
any time control. I show how to (1) frame a pseudo-experiment,
(2) database lichess.org data, and (3) carry out the analysis.
I argue that fast thinking is most prominent in quick games.
I analyse a sample containing games from pairs of users who have
played each other at multiple time controls and show that win
probabilities established using 180 sec Blitz games are heavily
discounted in 600 sec Rapid games. I tentatively conclude that
the dominance of fast thinking is significantly reduced at longer
time controls.</description>

      <title>Monetizing hobbies</title>
      <link>https://tegowerk.eu/posts/monetizing-hobbies/</link>
      <description>I don’t know if this is a new trend or if I’m just noticing it now, but more and more the popular wisdom seems to be that you shouldn’t monetize your hobby. That if you do, it turns it into a job, a hustle1; that it sucks all the fun out of it. Putting aside for now the fact that some people might want to turn their hobby into a job, monetizing a hobby seems to me to have some pretty big advantages for the rest of us, too:</description>
