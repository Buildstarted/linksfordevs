      <description>If at some point you realize that doing cryptography means having to manage long-term keys, it means you’re standing in the world of key management.

      <description>Building distributed applications is a tough job! To get it right you will need lots of tools just to get started. Think about availability, scalability, service discovery, data consistency, developer productivity... Now you have chosen some kind of a container-orchestration system like Kubernetes (K8s) to address some of the challenges.</description>

      <description>The hardest program I’ve ever written, once you strip out the whitespace, is
3,835 lines long. That handful of code took me almost a year to write. Granted,
that doesn’t take into account the code that didn’t make it. The commit
history shows that I deleted 20,704 lines of code over that time. Every
surviving line has about three fallen comrades.</description>

      <title>Flow Leak - Apps on Google Play</title>
      <link>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockia.flowleak&amp;hl=en_US</link>
      <description>Online security is extremely important in our rapidly growing technological world. Oftentimes passwords will inevitably be leaked online because some online websites that we signed up for was hacked. We often don't even know when account information are exposed and will continue to use the same password for other online services and websites.

Flow Leak can help you:
* Check if any email account info was exposed from previous data breaches
* Verify if any passwords have already been leaked
* Provide notifications for future breaches

Note that this app does not check your current account status. It will only check if your account shows up in online leaked databases.</description>

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.
