      <title>Some common gotchas when trying to deploy a dotnet gRPC app to AWS ECS</title>
      <link>https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/some-gotchas-when-deploying-a-dotnet-grpc-app-to-ecs/</link>
      <description>Just show me the code
As always if you don’t care about the post I have upload a few examples on my Github.
 Nowadays creating a new dotnet gRPC application is pretty straightforward. From the developer standpoint the experience of creating a gRPC app it’s quite similar to creating an API, furthermore, Visual Studio also offers Intellisense support for gRPC services and proto files.
As I stated before developing a dotnet gRPC app right now is an easy feat, but when you try to deploy it in some cloud provider that’s when some wrinkles might appear.</description>

      <title>How I Got Started with NeoVim’s Lua Configuration</title>
      <link>https://cj.rs/blog/my-setup/nvim-0-5/</link>
      <description>Four months ago I was still using SpaceVim when I stambled upon a blog post on how to configure NeoVim with Lua. I then started to create my own configuration. In this post I’ll share the learnings acquired in the process. I hope you will find this useful to create your own configuration!
