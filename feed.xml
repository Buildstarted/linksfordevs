      <title>Windows Authentication with HttpClient</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2021/Nov/27/NTLM-Windows-Authentication-Authentication-with-HttpClient</link>
      <description>In this short post I review how to use HttpClient with Windows Authentication security using Negotiate or NTLM authentication schemes, which oddly is not documented in the official documentation for the `CredentialCache` class used to handle authentication header generation in HttpClient. </description>

      <title>The fastest way to copy a file</title>
      <link>https://alexsaveau.dev/blog/performance/files/kernel/the-fastest-way-to-copy-a-file</link>
      <description>I’m on a mission to find the fastest way to copy and delete files on a modern machine. I thought a quick Google search would reveal the answer, but I only found this Stack Overflow post with people’s opinion on the matter (but no proof), a discussion on what the kernel can do to improve performance, and various articles claiming you should tar directories to copy them faster (there’s no chance of that being faster than a properly written parallel cp implementation).</description>

      <title>Don&amp;#39;t be a copy-paste dev</title>
      <link>https://bruno-oliveira.github.io/techblog/Dont-be-a-copy-paste-dev/</link>
      <description>Every once in a while there is a popular tweet, either with some strong statement in it or some controversial opinion that makes the internet blow up, ensuing endless retweets and many separate discussions about the content, or the person, who tweeted it. The most recent one has been this post by DHH (for context, he is the one who created Ruby on Rails - let that sink in by thinking just how many jobs this one guy ended up, indirectly, creating in the industry over the years. His impact in the field, like it or not, can’t be dismissed, period) that summarizes the key idea of an article he published, which you can (and definitely should!) read here:
