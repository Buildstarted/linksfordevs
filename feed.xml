Hey! I&amp;#39;m Pavel from London, I&amp;#39;m CTO of FastNetMon and we run DDoS attack detection with on premise installations in 146 countries.

This post was inspired by GitHub conversation which was triggered by Clickhouse&amp;#39;s team decision to start asking for CPU feature called AVX for all new installations.

      <title>Less is more agile</title>
      <link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/my_take_on_engineering_room_9/</link>
      <description>Dave Farley and Allen Holub are two people that I respect hugely when it comes to Software Development. I’ve been following them on twitter for quite a while, and am always taken in about their takes on driving continuous delivery and “lowercase agile” forward. So when both came together for Dave’s Engineering Room (sponsored by Equal Experts, who I work with), it was bound to be very interesting.
In this post I try to outline my key takeaways from watching the chat.</description>

      <title>Embracing Hypocrisy</title>
      <link>https://verzettelung.xyz/2022/09/02/</link>
      <description>Do you wince when celebrities point fingers at corporations and consumers for excess emissions while cruising the oceans on their yacht or flying from one continent to another on their private jet?
Does your blood pressure reach unhealthy levels when politicians accuse their rivals of embezzlement or tax evasion and the public later learns that this is exactly what they are guilty of themselves?
We dislike selfish people, but we hate hypocrites that are selfish and call out or punish others for being selfish.
This seems like a morally justifiable position, however, maybe we should reconsider our judgement and give ourselves some inner peace by seeing these hypocrites as second-order altruists that actually help society. &amp;#128579;</description>
