      <title>Azure Container Apps</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/azure-container-apps/</link>
      <description>Microsoft recently announced Azure Container Apps in Preview – a new serverless container platform. The idea behind this offering is to run your microservices style applications without needing to focus on the infrastructure and is built on top of industry standard Kubernetes. This platform provides value added services like out of the box Ingress, Auto Scale, Dapr integration with features like pubs/sub, service invocation and CI/CD pipeline support.</description>

      <title>SPAs in ASP.NET Core - Another Attempt 
</title>
      <link>https://wildermuth.com/2022/04/20/spas-in-aspnetcore-another-attempt/</link>
      <description>After discussing this topic with a client, I realized that my old method of hosting SPAs in 
ASP.NET Core didn&amp;#39;t handle resources correctly, so I dug in and came up with **yet another** technique. This one is the simpliest and the least intrusive and works better than most. Let me know what you think about it:

      <title>Planting Undetectable Backdoors in Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06974</link>
      <description>Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train
machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service
provider. We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor
into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves
normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the
classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly,
without the appropriate &amp;quot;backdoor key&amp;quot;, the mechanism is hidden and cannot be
detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks
for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees.
  First, we show how to plant a backdoor in any model, using digital signature
schemes. The construction guarantees that given black-box access to the
original model and the backdoored version, it is computationally infeasible to
find even a single input where they differ. This property implies that the
backdoored model has generalization error comparable with the original model.
Second, we demonstrate how to insert undetectable backdoors in models trained
using the Random Fourier Features (RFF) learning paradigm or in Random ReLU
networks. In this construction, undetectability holds against powerful
white-box distinguishers: given a complete description of the network and the
training data, no efficient distinguisher can guess whether the model is
&amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; or contains a backdoor.
  Our construction of undetectable backdoors also sheds light on the related
issue of robustness to adversarial examples. In particular, our construction
can produce a classifier that is indistinguishable from an &amp;quot;adversarially
robust&amp;quot; classifier, but where every input has an adversarial example! In
summary, the existence of undetectable backdoors represent a significant
theoretical roadblock to certifying adversarial robustness.</description>

      <title>Feature-Less Software</title>
      <link>https://feifan.blog/posts/feature-less-software</link>
      <description>Most software is feature-ful: built from an amalgamation of individual features, which are usually atomic ways to do something specific, arranged in a singular interface that has to work for every user of that piece of software. Each feature is usually built with a small number of end-to-end user experiences in mind (often in the form of &amp;quot;user stories&amp;quot;). Each feature has to live somewhere in the UI; sometimes they&amp;#39;re put in unexpected or awkward places, and every so often the whole UI gets shuffled up in a redesign.</description>

      <title>The Anti-Thiel Principle</title>
      <link>https://stakedy.com/long/the-anti-thiel-principle.html</link>
      <description>Peter Thiel describes a process where the best companies avoid competition and aim for ubiquitous monopolies. These companies focus on sales, marketing and business development at least as much as product. In contrast, the Anti-Thiel Principle holds that the best products are products that you will never know about because they focus only on products.</description>

      <title>Translate terms using Wikipedia articles</title>
      <link>https://marienraat.nl/blog/posts/translatewith-wiki/</link>
      <description>Some concepts have very specific translations in different languages that ordinary machine translations services like Google Translate and DeepL fail to grasp. A good way to really get the right translation for such concepts is to look up the article on Wikipedia and look at the different language versions of the article. I made https://TranslateWith.Wiki to make this process more convenient.</description>

      <title>That Time I Lost Control of a Server</title>
      <link>https://brianschrader.com/archive/that-time-i-lost-control-of-a-server/</link>
      <description>Good security hygiene is essential for software developers. The thing is: we tell ourselves that, but rarely ever do we actually experience the effects of bad security hygiene. While deterrence is the point of good hygiene, it&amp;#39;s helpful to walk through the real world consequences of bad hygiene and not just talk about the theoretical side of things.</description>

      <title>The Next COVID Crisis: Funding (with Jeff Zients and Zeke Emanuel)</title>
      <link>https://player.fm/series/in-the-bubble-with-andy-slavitt/the-next-covid-crisis-funding-with-jeff-zients-and-zeke-emanuel</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Andy tackles the pressing need for more COVID funding with two guests who are fighting to make it happen: outgoing White House Coronavirus Coordinator Jeff Zients and former COVID Transition Team member Dr. Zeke Emanuel. What will happen if the U.S. can&amp;#39;t afford to pay for a fourth round of vaccines? And what is holding Congress up? Zeke and Andy also discuss the plan Zeke is spearheading for the next phase of the pandemic, and Andy puts Zeke through a lightning round where he asks him about variant-specific vaccines, the potential return of mask mandates, how best to use oral antivirals like Paxlovid, and much more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Keep up with Andy on Twitter @ASlavitt and Instagram @andyslavitt. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Follow Zeke @ZekeEmanuel on Twitter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Joining Lemonada Premium is a great way to support our show and get bonus content.
