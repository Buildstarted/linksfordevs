      <description>The tech media is obsessed with data. But after eight years of measuring corporate data literacy, only 24% of companies  report  having reached data-driven nirvana.

      <title>Amazon Refused to Refund $7,000 After Shipping an Empty Box Instead of a Sony a1</title>
      <link>https://fstoppers.com/news/amazon-refused-refund-7000-after-shipping-empty-box-instead-sony-a1-564979</link>
      <description>A couple in Alabama were left shocked after Amazon delivered an empty box instead of the Sony a1 worth $7,000 that they ordered — and then refused to give them a refund. As reported by PetaPixel and The Denver Channel (skip to 1:03), Bill and Kelly Chiles ordered the Sony a1 back in mid-March and waited patiently for it to arrive. Upon delivery, they opened their package and were confused to find two boxes for the Sony a1, both of which were empty. Upon contacting Amazon, the company insisted that the product had been delivered and refused to offer a refund.</description>
