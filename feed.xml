      <title>Using DeepSeek R1 for RAG: Do&amp;#39;s and Don&amp;#39;ts</title>
      <link>https://blog.skypilot.co/deepseek-rag/</link>
      <description>DeepSeek R1 has shown great reasoning capability when it is firstly released. In this blog post, we detail our learnings in using DeepSeek R1 to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, tailored for legal documents.
We choose legal documents because legal professionals often face a daunting task: navigating libraries of cases, statutes, and informal legal commentary. Even the best-intentioned research can get bogged down in retrieving the right documents, let alone summarizing them accurately.</description>

      <title>What I Use to Make Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://cubbk.de/posts/drawio-vscode-plugin/</link>
      <description>There’s tools like Miro and Lucidchart which are very good for making diagrams and have cool multiplayer(gen z talk) features but with 2 major drawbacks:
separate from code not free The payed part can be ignored even though it’s a pain to switch tools every new company and not being to use it in personal projects but the separation from code does not cut it for me.
I’ve been using draw.io and exporting pngs for quite a while but recently I discovered a vscode plugin that fixed it all for me.</description>

      <title>Jeremy A Boyd | The False Summit</title>
      <link>https://jeremyaboyd.com/post/the-false-summit</link>
      <description>A friend of mine is always calling me out for never finishing anything, and never writing anything, and never responding to him after 5 PM or on weekends. I&amp;#39;m a bad friend, and I have accepted that, but he&amp;#39;s always asking me about whatever my latest hyperfixation project is. Did I finish it; did I write a post about it; did I release it to the app store. The question is triggering because the answer is almost always &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;.</description>

      <title>Devcontainers: I love you, I hate you</title>
      <link>https://www.mitchellrysavy.com/blog/2025/02/26/devcontainers.html</link>
      <description>When I joined GitHub in 2021, they were on the cusp of launching GitHub Codespaces. Codespaces is one part cloud IDE, one part VM; the key selling point is that you can go to any Codespaces-enabled repo in your browser, click “New Codespace,” and you’ll be launched into an environment where you can write, test, and commit code, without a lot of setup. This is powered primarily by Visual Studio Code’s devcontainer feature.</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding With Aider: Tips And Tricks</title>
      <link>http://mitchgordon.me/tools/2025/02/26/aider.html</link>
      <description>I started using aider last month as a way to get back in shape after a long leave from work. Eventually aider sped me up a lot, but I had to learn some new ways of approaching development. It was different from using cursor in that you don’t really see the code until it’s being edited. This doc is a compilation of the notes I took as I worked on a few projects, which I think will be helpful to others using aider for the first time.</description>

      <description>Cloud bills piling up faster than you expected? Terraform isn&amp;#39;t just for deploying infrastructure—it’s also an awesome cost optimization tool! Instead of manually tracking expenses and hoping for the best, Terraform helps you: Monitor and control cloud costs before they spiral out of control. Automate cost-efficient resource provisioning (no more oversized VMs!). Enforce budget limits and alerts so there are no nasty surprises.</description>
