      <title>Lazy Combinations in Elixir</title>
      <link>https://blog.smaller-infinity.com/posts/lazy-combinations-in-elixir/</link>
      <description>When building Guesswork, a logic programming library for Elixir, I ran into an interesting problem: supporting both logical And as well as infinite streams of possibilities. To give an example, the statement ‘Let A be some positive number, and let B be some factorial of A’, has both an infinite stream of values (A could be 1, 2, 3, etc.) and a logical conjunction; it cannot be represented without both.</description>

      <title>On Not Liking Computers « Paul Boddie's Free Software-related blog</title>
      <link>https://blogs.fsfe.org/pboddie/?p=1497</link>
      <description>Adam Williamson recently wrote about how he no longer really likes computers. This attracted many responses from people who misunderstood him and decided to dispense career advice, including doses of the usual material about “following one’s passion” or “changing one’s direction” (which usually involves becoming some kind of “global nomad”), which do make me wonder how some of these people actually pay their bills. Do they have a wealthy spouse or wealthy parents or “an inheritance”, or do they just do lucrative contracting for random entities whose nature or identities remain deliberately obscure to avoid thinking about where the money for those jobs really comes from? Particularly the latter would be the “global nomad” way, as far as I can tell.</description>

      <link>https://vitonsky.net/blog/2025/05/15/zeros-in-ux/</link>
      <description>User interfaces everywhere are a bit too generic nowadays, as they must be efficient in terms of maintenance and release time. However, that is not a reason to create a pointless and bad UX. It's enough to monitor the meaningfulness of interfaces and ask yourself, "Does it make sense?" to make the user experience great.</description>
