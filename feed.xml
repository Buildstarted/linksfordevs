      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2JT_q0eW7Q</link>
      <description>React Hooks is an amazing feature in React that allows you to leverage state and lifecycle methods inside of a functional component. You'll see more and more libraries updated to take advantage of React Hooks, so it's in your best interest to learn about them. In this video, we will convert a couple of React class components to functional components using React Hooks.

      <description>I've been shopping around for a back end framework to support a tabletop game

[https://restfulapi.net/] that would allow a front end app to perform basic CRUD

providing me with an introduction to what the development process would look

      <link>https://www.thingiverse.com/svenpetersen1965/about</link>
      <description>I am an engineer in electronic hardware development since 1994. The 3D printing and 3D design came to me in September 2019 and I really enjoy using these tools for my hobbies (or just for fun). My interests are retro computing and electronics. I like to develop new hardware for the 1980's Commodore C64 computer, which still seems to be popular among those, who ever owned one. </description>

        methods with minimal integration. User agents (e.g., browsers)
        facilitate the payment flow between merchant and user.</description>

      <title>Relating Natural Language Aptitude to Individual Differences in Learning Programming Languages</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8</link>
      <description>This experiment employed an individual differences approach to test the hypothesis that learning modern programming languages resembles second “natural” language learning in adulthood. Behavioral and neural (resting-state EEG) indices of language aptitude were used along with numeracy and fluid cognitive measures (e.g., fluid reasoning, working memory, inhibitory control) as predictors. Rate of learning, programming accuracy, and post-test declarative knowledge were used as outcome measures in 36 individuals who participated in ten 45-minute Python training sessions. The resulting models explained 50–72% of the variance in learning outcomes, with language aptitude measures explaining significant variance in each outcome even when the other factors competed for variance. Across outcome variables, fluid reasoning and working-memory capacity explained 34% of the variance, followed by language aptitude (17%), resting-state EEG power in beta and low-gamma bands (10%), and numeracy (2%). These results provide a novel framework for understanding programming aptitude, suggesting that the importance of numeracy may be overestimated in modern programming education environments.</description>
