      <title>2022 Mac Studio (20-core M1 Ultra) Review</title>
      <link>http://hrtapps.com/blogs/20220427/</link>
      <description>I do a lot of writing as an engineer, but it’s technical writing.  It’s all about documenting facts and data in a direct manner, in tables and charts, without much emotion or creativity.  So when I get to review new        
pro 
Macs, I always look for some sort of inspiration, some sort of creative hook that leads me to an interesting theme.  With the Mac Studio Ultra, the theme was direct and turned out to be technical after all: this 8x8x4&amp;quot; supercomputer is off the charts. More on that in a bit.</description>

      <title>Real World Cryptography Conference 2022</title>
      <link>https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/04/26/real-world-cryptography-conference-2022/</link>
      <description>The IACR’s annual Real World Cryptography (RWC) conference took place in Amsterdam a few weeks ago. It remains the best venue for highlights of cryptographic constructions and attacks for the real world. While the conference was fully remote last year, this year it was a 3-day hybrid event, live-streamed from a conference center in charming central Amsterdam with an audience of about 500 cryptographers.

Some members of our Cryptography Services team attended in person, while others shifted their schedules by six hours to watch the talks live online. In this post, we share summaries of some of our favorite talks. Have a stroopwafel and enjoy!</description>

      <title>CoreWCF 1.0.0 Release</title>
      <link>https://corewcf.github.io/blog/2022/04/28/corewcf-1_0_0_release</link>
      <description>Today we&amp;#39;ve hit a big milestone and have released version 1.0.0 of CoreWCF. This is the end of the beginning of a long journey for me that started just over 5 years ago back in January of 2017. I was given 3 weeks to put together a basic prototype of what a WCF service implementation would look like built on .NET Core. At the end of the 3 weeks, I had a working implementation which could host a service using BasicHttpBinding. My prototype then sat there gathering dust as a proof of concept while it was decided what to do with it. There weren&amp;#39;t the resources to develop this into a full product with feature parity to WCF, but there were many customers blocked unable to move to .NET Core without doing a complete rewrite of their service. It was eventually decided that I would spend some time cleaning up my prototype implementation, including adding NetTcp support, and the code would be donated to the open source community to see if this was something that a community would build around for it to live outside of Microsoft.</description>

      <title>Creating Offline Custom Style Maps With tileserver-gl - Yasoob Khalid</title>
      <link>https://yasoob.me/posts/custom-map-with-tileserver-gl/</link>
      <description>Hi lovely people! &amp;#128075; Last year, I saw a project on Product Hunt which allowed people to generate posters from maps. The website has since closed down and the company has been acquired by Airbnb. This is what the output looked like:
Now, I was interested in figuring out how they were able to render this map. My experience with maps was limited to Google Maps only so I was excited to explore the world of custom map generation.</description>

      <description>The current &amp;quot;race&amp;quot; debate (or lack thereof) is essentially about the honoring of 
opinions from one side, but not the other. There is no equal footing here. 
The only way to get on common ground is to put both sides in an equivalent 
place - Only my opinion and worldview matters to me and the attitudes of 
others are irrelevant. Now, we are both fighting with swords.</description>
