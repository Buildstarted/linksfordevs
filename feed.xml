      <title>The GNU Name System</title>
      <link>https://lsd.gnunet.org/lsd0001/</link>
      <description>This document contains the GNU Name System (GNS) technical
      specification.
      GNS is a decentralized and censorship-resistant name
      system that provides a privacy-enhancing alternative to the Domain
      Name System (DNS).
       
       
      This document defines the normative wire format of resource records,
      resolution processes, cryptographic routines and security
      considerations for use by implementers.
      It is published here to inform readers about the function
      of GNS, guide future GNS implementations, and ensure
      interoperability among implementations including with the
      pre-existing GNUnet implementation.
       
       
      This specification was developed outside the IETF and does not have
      IETF consensus.  It is published here to guide implementation of GNS
      and to ensure interoperability among implementations.</description>

      <link>https://harshal.sheth.io/2022/01/31/webassembly.html</link>
      <description>WebAssembly is at an inflection point. Over the next few years, I expect to see increased adoption of WebAssembly across the tech sphere, from containerization to plugin systems to serverless computing platforms. The following is a discussion of what WebAssembly is, what makes it a relevant technology, and where it’s being used today. I’ll also describe some potentially high-impact applications and make some predictions about its future.</description>

      <description>I was listening to the Tim Ferriss Show podcast episode #532 with Sheila Heen (Harvard Negotiation Project, co-author of Difficult Conversations: How To Discuss What Matters Most) and a specific story she told during the conversation really resonated with me and I have been thinking alot about it since I heard it. Below is the excerpt of that story in her own words.
 It reminds me, I sometimes tell this story about my eldest son.</description>

      <title>Discord Holds the Keys to Your Heart</title>
      <link>https://artemis.sh/2022/01/30/discord-holds-the-keys-to-your-heart.html</link>
      <description>A friend of ours has been struggling with RSI. As part of their plans to address this, they decided to create a secondary Discord account to use on their phone, for direct messaging purposes. That way, they could still talk to people from their phone, but wouldn’t be tempted to participate in active discussions in group channels. As part of the signup process, Discord forced them to provide a phone number for account verification. They provided the same phone number they used for their primary Discord account, and in response, Discord locked both accounts, cutting them off from a huge part of their social circle. Discord’s support was unable to unlock the account or provide any information on when it might be unlocked.</description>

      <title>10 lessons from a 5 year Meta-rollercoaster ride</title>
      <link>https://zakelfassi.com/2022/02/01/10-lessons-from-a-5-year-meta-facebook-rollercoaster-ride/</link>
      <description>I joined Facebook (before it went Meta) in 2016. At that time, the company size was just shy of 15,000 employees, which, even at that scale, is much much more manageable than what it is today (the only publicly available number so far is 58K by the end of 2020 – watch out for the company’s earnings Feb 2 as that number can only go up). That is close to a +400% growth, just in employee size.</description>

      <title>My most meaningful work of 2021 – not falling down</title>
      <link>https://www.xorph.com/nfd/2022/01/04/my-most-meaningful-work-of-2021/</link>
      <description>Last year, in cooperation with many of my friends on a private social network, I took an idea from neighborhood organizations here in Chicago and started a small online-only mutual aid fund. Over twelve months, we distributed more than seven thousand dollars from some friends to others, mostly in increments of $100 USD. I want to be clear that everyone involved in that system was of equal importance to its operation: people have to identify and articulate their need for help in order for donations to have a place to go, and both asking and donating take courage and labor. A number of the people involved made requests at one point and donations at another, which I think illustrates how important the fluidity of a mutual aid project can be. Here are the steps we took to get it running.</description>

      <title>Reflections on six months of fatherhood</title>
      <link>https://jasoncrawford.org/reflections-on-six-months-of-fatherhood</link>
      <description>To be fed from a spoon requires three distinct skills. First, you must open your mouth when the spoon approaches. Second, you must close your mouth around the spoon once it has fully entered the mouth (and not before). Third, you must swallow the food that remains in your mouth after the spoon is withdrawn, rather than spitting it out.

      <title>A Better Turing Machine Tape Model</title>
      <link>https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/12/31/turing-machine-tape.html</link>
      <description>A Turing machine is a simple type of computer. Its memory consists of a single strip of tape that is divided into discrete cells, each one of which is marked with one of a fixed number of colors. Data is read from and written to the tape by means of a tape head. Turing machine memory is not random-access; the machine head can reach any cell on the tape, but it must move cell by cell to get there. At any given time the tape head is scanning just one cell.</description>

      <title>Hello OmniSharp on .NET 6.0!</title>
      <link>https://www.strathweb.com/2022/01/hello-omnisharp-on-net-6-0/</link>
      <description>On December 15, 2021 we released version 1.38.0 of OmniSharp which, for the first time, included .NET 6.0 builds of the OmniSharp server. The related feature branch was maintained for over a year, and previously contained a .NET 5-based variant of OmniSharp, though that one was never released.</description>

      <link>http://feed.azuredevops.show/net-6-iot-with-bryan-costanich-episode-177</link>
      <description>This week, Jeffrey welcomes Bryan Costanich, Founder of Wilderness Labs and former VP of Xamarin. Bryan talks with us about the state of .NET, the advantages and disadvantages of moving into the embedded space, and how embedded computing is the new revolution. Bryan is also on a mission to leave the world a little better than he found it. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [2:04] Bryan talks about his background and time at Xamarin, Microsoft, and the origins of Wilderness Labs. [4:16] What is the state of .NET? In the embedded system world, what are the realistic options and future in 2022 and beyond? [8:04] What are both the advantages and disadvantages of moving into the embedded space? [11:04] Bryan discusses how a lot of the advantages of microcontrollers moving to embedded are historical in the sense that you are developing for embedded devices that haven’t changed a lot since the ’70s and ’80s. [12:30] Seventy percent of all security bugs aren’t even an issue in .NET. [15:05] Bryan talks about his intent to make it easier for people to use and to create the ideal experience through Xamarin. [15:41] The next phase of humankind’s technological computing journey is embedded computing. This is the new revolution. [16:45] There are three parts of the IoT market: consumer, commercial, and industrial. [20:23] Bryan talks about how Xamarin’s main products are compromised and where they land on the spectrum. He discusses Azure Sphere and Raspberry Pi. [26:29] What exactly does Bryan develop with? He describes his setup. [31:09] Some fun smart chicken coop talk! [34:42] How does crash reporting work in Xamarin? [36:55] In the core compute module, how does one build the enclosure that it snaps into? [39:11] What is the most common product mix? [39:30] When will Xamarin’s products be released? &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  — New video podcast!   (Sponsor)  — Available on Amazon!   — Follow to stay informed about future events!     &amp;amp;nbsp; Want to Learn More? Visit  for show notes and additional episodes. </description>

      <link>https://blog.codingmilitia.com/2022/01/31/array-or-object-deserialization/</link>
      <description>Ah, the joys of integrating with third-party APIs… We always end up having to hammer something to get things working &amp;#129315;. This is a post about one of such situations, resorting to some JSON deserialization trickery (via JsonConverter) to be able to get things working.</description>
