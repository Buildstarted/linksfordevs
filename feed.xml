      <title>5G: The outsourced elephant in the room - Articles</title>
      <link>https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/5g-elephant-in-the-room/</link>
      <description>In a break from the usual GPS/Galileo, DNA and C++ posts, here is a bit on 5G and national security. It turns out that through PowerDNS and its parent company Open-Xchange, we know a lot about how large scale European communication service providers work - most of whom are our customers in some way.
In addition, in a previous life I worked in national security and because of that I have relevant knowledge of how governments (your own and foreign ones) “interact” with telecommunication providers.</description>
