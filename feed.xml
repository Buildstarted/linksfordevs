      <description>Awaitables are the types on which await can be called. It happens due to “duck typing” – the only thing which makes type “awaitable” is an existence of the GetAwaiter() method that returns type implementing INotifyCompletion interface. That’s it.</description>

      <title>JUNETEENTH WORLD WIDE CELEBRATION</title>
      <link>http://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm</link>
      <description>Juneteenth 

                is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of 

                slavery in the United States.  Dating back to 1865, it was on 

                June 19th that the Union soldiers, led by Major 

                General Gordon Granger, landed at Galveston, Texas with news 

                that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free. Note 

                that this was two and a half years after President 

                Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation - which had become official 

                January 1, 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation had little impact 

                on the Texans due to the minimal number of Union troops to 

                enforce the new Executive Order. However, with the surrender of 

                General Lee in April of 1865, and the arrival of General 

                Granger’s regiment, the forces were finally strong enough to 

                influence and overcome the resistance.</description>

      <title>The One About Giving &amp; Receiving Feedback</title>
      <link>https://dariagrudzien.com/posts/the-one-about-giving-and-receiving-feedback/</link>
      <description>Or How To Develop Yourself The Hard Way.
 For a long time I’ve been interested in the topic of feedback—learning from others things that allow us to grow and develop ourselves, as well as improve our cooperation with other people. Recently I’ve been wondering why it’s so rare for people in my culture (Central/Eastern Europe) to share feedback—it’s particularly surprising to me when people struggle finding things to praise for. Giving someone positive feedback feels like such an easy way to do something nice for the person, to make them feel appreciated.
My conclusion is that both giving and receiving honest feedback requires us to open up, cut through our armour all the way to our guts and become vulnerable to the other person.</description>

      <title>my love letter to redo</title>
      <link>https://fzakaria.com/2020/06/08/my-love-letter-to-redo.html</link>
      <description>This is a public love letter to redo &amp; the joy it brings building software. I remember when I first finished The Little Schemer and wrote my first semi useful “JSON Diff” program. I was exalted. I was elated. I was ecstatic. There is something magical when you learn Lisp that is really tough to convey over a blog post or short article. One must try it, to grok it. I have not professionally used Lisp much since however it’s been immensely impactful in the way I think about &amp; construct software. Redo is this for build systems.</description>

      <link>https://staysaasy.com/engineering/2020/06/09/Don%27t-Joke.html</link>
      <description>One of the most narrow pieces of feedback I give to people being promoted to manager is simple - don’t joke about firing people. When I deliver this feedback people will often respond with some form of befuddlement: “I wasn’t planning to”, “Ummm….OK”, “Obviously”. However, this feedback is driven by knowledge of mistakes made by a number of new managers.</description>

      <title>Create diagrams with code using Graphviz</title>
      <link>https://ncona.com/2020/06/create-diagrams-with-code-using-graphviz/</link>
      <description>Have you ever had to draw an architecture diagram and found the repetitive clicking and dragging tedious? Did you have to do modifications to that diagram and found it complicated?

Graphviz is an open source graph visualization software that allows us to decribe a diagram using code, and have it automatically drawn for us. If the diagram needs to be modified in the future, we just need to modify the description and the nodes and edges will be repositioned automatically for us.

Drawing graphs

Before we start writing graphs, we need to learn how we can convert our code into an image so we can test what we are doing.
