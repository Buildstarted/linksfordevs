      <description>Think about your team workflow. Then try what makes sense for your context. Then adjust. The most exciting words in engineering are, “It turns out…”. A recent Twitter kerfuffle about the pull request team workflow happened to mention me. The last thing I want to do is to participate in another pissing contest about code reviews, but here I am.</description>

      <title>.NET Rocks! Making a Copilot with Phil Haack</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1841</link>
      <description>Microsoft is making several Copilot products - should you? Carl and Richard talk to Phil Haack about the latest version of ab.bot, his customer success startup. Now Phil is calling ab.bot a Copilot for Customer Success since he incorporated OpenAI ChatGPT into it. The conversation tries to steer clear of the hysteria around modern large language models (although it is hard!) and more into the practical applications - using large language models to summarize long customer support conversations and find related conversations to current ones - perhaps identifying new high-priority features! The wave of large language models is in its early days, and with the new APIS available, it may be time to make them part of your projects too!</description>

      <title>Controlling My AC Unit With nanoFramework</title>
      <link>https://blog.mrcsharp.com.au/post/controlling-my-ac-unit-with-nanoframework/</link>
      <description>Why My room’s AC unit (Panasonic) is quite old. It does a great job cooling/heating the place after all these years, but also lacks any “smart” capabilities found on modern units.
Personally, I am not a fan of making everything at my home internet-connected for reasons I won’t delve into now, and I certainly don’t want my AC unit to be internet-connected either. However, I want to be able to expand on its functionality as needed.</description>

      <link>https://sreyaj.dev/implementing-feature-flags-in-angular</link>
      <description>Feature flags are basically a configuration for your application where we specify which features are enabled/disabled. We would normally just comment out that part of the code which we don&amp;#39;t want to be made available and then later come back and unco...</description>

      <title>Recursive LLMs</title>
      <link>https://tevfik.xyz/posts/recursive-llms/</link>
      <description>Last week was a thrilling week for the world of AI, and I had two significant realizations that I want to share with you.
Realisation 1: Language Models (LLMs) are stateful and become more powerful with more context. Most software we use is stateless, meaning that each time we open an app, it behaves almost the same way and stores minimal information about our past. This is easier for engineers, but it is limiting.</description>

      <title>Why Janet?</title>
      <link>https://ianthehenry.com/posts/why-janet/</link>
      <description>I never thought it could happen to me. I mean, parentheses? In this day and age? But for the past couple years, my go-to programming language for fun side projects has been a little Lisp dialect called Janet.
(print &amp;quot;hey janet&amp;quot;)
I like Janet so much that I wrote an entire book about it, and put it on The Internet for free, in the hopes of attracting more Janetors to the language.
I think you should read it, but I know that you don’t believe me, so I’m going to try to convince you. Here’s my attempt at a sales pitch: here is why you – you of all people – should give Janet a chance.</description>
