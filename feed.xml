      <title>YouTube&amp;#39;s Fake Animal Rescue Ring</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqPXcv-IE0k</link>
      <description>Since my latest video “YouTube&amp;#39;s Fake Animal Rescue Channels” I decided to do a bit more digging in the fake animal rescue genre. And what I found was a disturbing connection between multiple channels, that seems to be a legitimate animal abuse ring right here on YouTube.

The Channels Discussed:
KM Daily
Happy Dog
The Rescue Journey TV
pabloxito17
Love Rescue Animals
yorquy
Animal Lighthouse
Little Furry Friends
Animal SafeGaurd
The Rescue Journey

MUSIC USED:
Haunted by CO.AG - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0WjL4phiuk
The Lost by CO.AG - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpowIDAOMhc&amp;amp;t=3s
A Dark Myth by CO.AG - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXbb7cuGf5M&amp;amp;t=103s

      <description>If you have a Windows Runtime class with a property whose Windows Runtime type is an array, then the C++/WinRT projection expresses the property setter and getter as follows: // Set array void IntArray(winrt::array_view&amp;lt;int32_t const&amp;gt; const&amp;amp; value);  // Get array winrt::com_array&amp;lt;int32_t&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Optimization: what I did to make the game 300 times faster</title>
      <link>https://thesaplinggame.com/devlogs/optimization.html</link>
      <description>A major point of feedback for evolution simulator The Sapling is that the players wanted larger levels. To make this possible, I spent three months optimizing the underlying game engine. This article is an in-depth explanation of one of the main insights I had. There are several interactive simulations you can play with in your browser to get a deeper understanding of how everything works.</description>

      <title>Deprecating scp</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/835962/ae41b27bc20699ad/</link>
      <description>The scp
command, which uses the SSH protocol to
copy files between 
machines, is deeply wired into the fingers of many Linux users and
developers — doubly so for those of us who still think of it as a more
secure replacement for rcp.  Many users may be surprised to learn,
though, that the resemblance to rcp goes beyond the name; much of
the underlying protocol is the same as well.  That protocol is showing its
age, and the OpenSSH community has
considered it deprecated for a while. 
Replacing scp in a way that keeps users happy may not be an easy
task, though.</description>

      <title>The Most Confusing Grep Mistakes I&amp;#39;ve Ever Made</title>
      <link>https://blog.robertelder.org/top-5-grep-mistakes/</link>
      <description>In this article, I&amp;#39;ll discuss 5 very confusing mistakes that have caused me to waste significant amounts of time when using the command-line tool known as &amp;#39;grep&amp;#39; to search for things. &amp;#160;I have chosen to document these mistakes in detail because they are mistakes that beginners are very likely to make at some point, but also to know be able to debug on their own. &amp;amp;nsbp;The root causes of these mistakes are: &amp;#160;Not knowing what flavour of regular expression that grep is currently using (and/or not understanding what features that flavour supports); Not considering the escaping rules of your shell; Issues with character encodings.</description>

      <title>Add natural language understanding to your bot - Part 2</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/add-natural-language-understanding-to-your-bot-part2/</link>
      <description>This blog post is about adding natural language understanding to your bot. Language Understanding (LUIS) is a cloud-based API service that helps you to recognize the intent of user input and better direct the conversation flow. In the previous post I configured LUIS and in this post I will explain how we can use the LUIS service in a Bot Application.</description>

      <title>Underjord | The BEAM marches forward</title>
      <link>https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html</link>
      <description>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don&amp;#39;t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn&amp;#39;t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I&amp;#39;d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</description>

      <description>Online advertising is, in my opinion, intrusive, invasive, and, in the case of accessibility, frequently destructive. Yet since it first emerged in 1994, online advertising has been one of the few ways content creators have had to be compensated for their efforts. Until now.</description>

      <title>Life and Death of a Linux Process</title>
      <link>https://natanyellin.com/posts/life-and-death-of-a-linux-process/</link>
      <description>This post contains a rough sketch of the life and death of a process on Linux. It is a first-order approximation only. A later post will refine this further and provide a more precise description, adding details about pid namespaces, obscure syscalls, and little known flags.
Birth Every time a process is created, really another process split itself using the fork or clone syscall. After forking, processes usually run the execve syscall to swap the currently executing binary with another one.</description>

      <link>https://www.krewast.de/artikel/dont-make-me-think-about-whether-i-should-pay-you/</link>
      <description>I recently watched a few videos on YouTube about the latest and greatest LEGO sets. I didn’t do it because I’m super interested in LEGO (that was a while ago) but because the YouTube algorithm decided that I had to. I naturally obeyed. The results were as expected: I felt old and none of those sets triggered any kind of “I need to have this” response. Until I saw this:</description>

      <title>A Productive Productivity System</title>
      <link>https://mrbalihai.github.io/2020/11/05/a-productive-productivity-system.html</link>
      <description>I’ve tried many different systems and tools over the years: Getting Things Done (GTD), todo.txt, Taskwarrior, Org Mode to name a few. One thing I’ve discovered is that productivity systems are like dieting; you feel really motivated when starting out but after a few weeks the enthusiasm starts to wane and you quickly start to fall out of practice. I’ve been trying GTD on and off for several years now but failed to really gel with it meaningfully. The one I’ve had the most success with so far is Bullet Journaling. I want to add that I’m not Bullet Journaling on the same level as all these creative hand drawn Instagram masterpieces you see; my approach is very much messy, minimal and functional. I follow most of the principles outlined on the Bullet Journal Website: a dot for a task, a dash for a note, a small circle for an event, each day has it’s own heading, once a task is complete I put a cross through the dot, if I carry forward a task the dot becomes an arrow, if the task is no longer relevant I put a line through it. I suspect the reason this has worked so well for me is because it’s the first time I’ve tried hand-written notes rather than a digital system and perhaps if I had tried hand written lists with GTD it would have been equally successful.</description>
