      <title>The code I’m still ashamed of</title>
      <link>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/</link>
      <description>If you write code for a living, there’s a chance that at some point in your
career, someone will ask you to code something a little deceitful – if not
outright unethical.

This happened to me back in the year 2000. And it’s something I’ll never be able
to forget.

I wrote my first line of code at 6 years old. I’m no prodigy though. I had a lot
of help from my dad at the time. But I was hooked. I loved it.

By the time I was 15, I was working part-time for my dad’s consulting firm. I

      <description>You can use Cosmos DB to
burn money,
but you can also use it as a database. Cosmos DB is horizontally scalable,
which means that you can always increase the capacity of the system on the fly,
as long as you partition your data well enough. Here is what Cosmos DB
documentation says about choosing a good partition key:</description>

      <description>Slowsort is a pessimal sorting algorithm based on the Multiply and Surrender paradigm. The algorithm is designed to be deterministically sub-optimal and it could easily be the worst way anyone could sort an array.</description>

      <description>Excellent fresh mozzarella is milky, tender, and mild, with a faint layer of cream beneath the skin that gushes a little when you slice it. This is mozzarella you eat when it's still warm, and it never goes into the fridge. Here's how to make it at home.</description>

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Foster (Paul Soter) tries to fit the word "Meow" into a routine traffic stop.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A handful of state troopers are put in the uncomfortable position of having to actually enforce the law in this high-spirited comedy. Mac (Steve Lemme), Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar), Foster (Paul Stoter), and Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske) are four Vermont state troopers whose dedication to duty is not exactly an inspiration to law enforcement officers everywhere. Stationed in a small town near the Canadian border, the troopers don't have much to do, so they while away their hours smoking dope and harassing hapless motorists. Their superior officer, Capt. O'Hagan (Brian Cox), likes the boys and they try to keep their more outrageous antics out of his earshot, but they often run afoul of fellow trooper Farva (Kevin Heffernan), who insists on doing things by the book. When Governor Jessman (Lynda Carter) announces massive budget cuts for Vermont law enforcement personnel, things look bad for the troopers and they must quickly prove their worth or they'll be forced to look for real jobs. Appropriately enough, the troopers stumble upon some information regarding a group of marijuana dealers operating along the border; the guys figure this is just the sort of high-profile bust that could save their careers, but the police department of a nearby town gets wind of the troopers' plans. The Earlville police are no friends of the troopers, and they set out to ruin their moment of glory. Super Troopers was written by the five-man comedy troupe Broken Lizard, who also star as the five troopers; the group's leader, Jay Chandrasekhar, directed.

When I see that a name can be improved I always think this is priority number one. My colleagues often say “later”.</description>

a friend asked me to turn it into a blog post.  I've edited it, mostly
adding more links to elsewhere, but there are some additions here.)</description>

      <title>Lets stop being stupid about security</title>
      <link>http://www.adambourg.com/security/sql/2020/07/26/Lets-stop-being-stupid-about-security.html</link>
      <description>I hate it when I run across what is reported to be an epic hack involving Russians, Chinese or spies only it turns out the hacking victims were not taking any form of basic security seriously. Its like asking Bonnie and Clyde to rob a bank where the combo is printed on a large banner outside the vault and there are no keys to any safe deposit boxes. Or it’s like letting the fox get inside the hen house.</description>
