      <title>If Worker Pay Had Kept Pace With Productivity Gains Since 1968, Today&amp;#39;s Minimum Wage Would Be $24 an Hour</title>
      <link>https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/01/21/if-worker-pay-had-kept-pace-productivity-gains-1968-todays-minimum-wage-would-be-24</link>
      <description>In such a world, a full-time minimum wage worker would be earning $48,000 a year in the United States... If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would be close to $12 an hour today, more than 65 percent higher than the national minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. While this would make a huge difference in the lives of many people earning close to the national minimum wage, it is actually a relatively unambitious target.</description>

      <title>Blazor in Action</title>

      <description>An example-driven guide to building reusable UI components and web frontends—all with Blazor, C#, and .NET.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

Blazor, a powerful C#-based frontend framework from Microsoft, makes it easy to create fast rich web applications without the limitations of typical JavaScript-based tools. Blazor components seamlessly blend C# and standard HTML markup, so you can build web frontends using the same technology as your server-side code. With Blazor WebAssembly, you can also run your C# code natively in the browser.</description>

Testing is not dead
Lee Hawkins
@therockertester   
I will explain what testing *really* is and why we can&amp;#39;t automate everything. I&amp;#39;ll also provide some tips for improving the testing skills of those not in specialized testing roles.

      <title>What Working At Stripe Has Been Like</title>
      <link>https://kalzumeus.com/2020/10/09/four-years-at-stripe/</link>
      <description>I joined Stripe four years ago to make starting an Internet business easier, mostly by work on Stripe Atlas. This has been a series of adjustments for me: to working as an employee, to experiencing hypergrowth, to being closer to the Silicon Valley culture, and to some of the challenges in balancing career and other commitments during my life stage and the global coronavirus pandemic of 2020.</description>

      <title>Who cares about security by&amp;#160;obscurity</title>
      <link>https://blog.viraptor.info/post/who-cares-about-security-by-obscurity</link>
      <description>I end up taking about the security by obscurity with other engineers and it’s
sometimes not easy to classify what solution is or isn’t of that kind.
Recently the conversation online was restarted with a post.
I’d like to propose a different way to look at this issue. Replacing the
whole concept with costs, benefits and&amp;#160;context.</description>

      <title>Normalizing Failure with Susana Benavidez | Hanselminutes with Scott Hanselman</title>
      <link>https://hanselminutes.simplecast.com/episodes/normalizing-failure-with-susana-benavidez-SzXBgV6Y</link>
      <description>Susana Benavidez has had an interesting path into technology and she wants to normalize it. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s not straight and narrow, sometimes it&amp;#39;s windy and filled with bumps. What would tech look like if we normalized failure and gave folks a safe place to fail fast, fail often, and come out on the other side better than ever?</description>

      <title>How Spotify is Killing the Open Podcast Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://www.singhkays.com/blog/how-spotify-is-killing-the-open-podcast-ecosystem/</link>
      <description>Earlier this year, when Spotify announced that “The Joe Rogan Experience” would stream exclusively on Spotify, it sent shockwaves throughout the podcast ecosystem. This deal – reportedly worth over $100 million – is one of the most lucrative podcast deals. The presence of this deal, let alone the magnitude, is rare for the podcast ecosystem, which is built on open principles i.e. all podcasts are available everywhere. Therefore, the concept of exclusivity does not exist in the vocabulary of podcast listeners nor podcast creators.</description>

      <description>I was first diagnosed with depression when I was working on a startup in 2007. I went to the doctor, told him I was feeling mild flu symptoms for a couple of months, he asked me a few questions, determined that I had depression, gave my some SSRIs, and sent me home.</description>
