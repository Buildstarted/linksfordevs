      <title>SimulaVR</title>
      <link>https://simulavr.com/blog/2023-timeline/</link>
      <description>Last year, we finished an early version of our Review Unit prototype, which showcased our displays, optics, and primary boards functioning together with our software. Our next major milestone is to deliver a more polished Review Unit (henceforth referred to as Simula&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Polished Review Unit&amp;quot;) into the hands of YouTubers. After that, we will release a small early batch of Founders Edition units to our earliest preorderers. And after that, the remainder of our units will be distributed to the rest of our preorderers (in the order they were purchased, with preference for Founders Edition units first).</description>

      <title>Project Шайба - Blago&amp;#39;s blog</title>
      <link>https://petrovs.info/post/2023-01-12-shaiba/</link>
      <description>Update So, here is the code. It’s really simple gadget. The whole setup took me less than a hour for building and coding.
I got the rotary dialer from a local auction site, like Ebay. My first idea was to include everything inside it’s box and leave only the USB cable outside but it was encapsulated and I didn’t have any success for opening it. Originally, the cable had 5 pin DIN connector but only three pins were connected ( White, Brown and Green):</description>

      <title>Building general artificial intelligence… for board games.</title>
      <link>https://www.adama-platform.com/2023/01/10/general-artificial-intelligence.html</link>
      <description>Much has been written about perfect information games like chess, and I am reviewing literature on imperfect games like hearts. As many of you know, I am a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica (BSG) and the associated board game. I believe there is a level beyond imperfect games that requires deception. Honestly, it seems like a bad idea to teach machines how to lie, but as a hacker, I am focused on building a worthy adversary.

      <title>Large Transformer Model Inference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-01-10-inference-optimization/</link>
      <description>Large transformer models are mainstream nowadays, creating SoTA results for a variety of tasks. They are powerful but very expensive to train and use. The extremely high inference cost, in both time and memory, is a big bottleneck for adopting a powerful transformer for solving real-world tasks at scale.
Why is it hard to run inference for large transformer models? Besides the increasing size of SoTA models, there are two main factors contributing to the inference challenge (Pope et al.</description>

Support raw SQL queries without defining an entity type for the result
That means less boilerplate code!

      <title>Code is not Prose</title>
      <link>https://joeblu.com/blog/2023_01_code_prose/</link>
      <description>Once a month or so, this idea comes rambling out of the programming community1:
 Software is prose. It is written to communicate ideas to others, it has the interesting side effect that it can be transformed into something a computer can execute.
- Chet Hendrickson
 This sounds nice on paper. It makes for a good conference talk about how to structure software, how to design programming languages, and how to collaborate.</description>

      <description>In my blog series, Nullable reference types in C# - Migrating to nullable reference types, we discussed the benefits of enabling nullable reference types in your C# code, and annotating your code so the compiler and IDE can give you more reliable hints about whether a particular variable or property may need to be checked for being null before using it.</description>

      <title>9 Best Practices to Safely Deploy and Keep Your Application Healthy at Scale</title>
      <link>https://michaelscodingspot.com/safe-application-deployment/</link>
      <description>Disclaimer: This blog post was written by a human, with no AI-generated text. An application’s code base is a living entity. It keeps growing, changing, and adapting. There’s always a new feature to add, more bugs to solve, and new bugs that are created as a result. As the teams grow, the code changes more often and there are ever more features, more issues, and more bugs. Thorough manual testing becomes impossible the bigger your application gets and as you ship more frequently.</description>
