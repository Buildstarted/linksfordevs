      <title>Quick overview and use case with EventFlow - DDD #1</title>
      <link>https://goatreview.com/quick-overview-with-usecase-eventflow-ddd/</link>
      <description>Introduction


In the ever-evolving world of software architecture, one concept that stands out for its ability to manage complexity and align development with business needs is Domain-Driven Design (DDD). A brainchild of Eric Evans, DDD has emerged as a fundamental approach for professionals seeking to build robust, scalable systems that</description>

      <title>Colin Woodbury - A Tour of the Lisps</title>
      <link>https://www.fosskers.ca/en/blog/rounds-of-lisp</link>
      <description>2023 seems to have been the year where I &amp;quot;made the rounds&amp;quot; of a number of major Lisps. There were several elements that lead to this. Firstly must have been my exposure to Elixir in 2022, which introduced me to the idea of debugging live systems and &amp;quot;staying in your program&amp;quot;. Secondly must have been my chief complaint of Rust; although it is a wonderful language and ecosystem in many ways, you can&amp;#39;t say that it&amp;#39;s beautiful, which my previous love Haskell very much was. Thirdly then must been the talk Stop Writing Dead Programs by Jack Rusher, which opened my eyes to the prevalence of the write-compile-run development cycle and how we can escape from it. And last was my day-to-day usage of Emacs, whose configuration language is also a Lisp. Thanks Henrik.</description>

      <title>HTTP at Thirty-Three</title>
      <link>https://www.simplethread.com/http-at-thirty-three/</link>
      <description>Explore the enduring significance of HTTP in its 33rd year with Homer Painter&amp;#39;s insightful blog &amp;#39;HTTP at Thirty-Three&amp;#39;. Published on January 26, 2024, this piece delves into the foundational role of HTTP 1.1 in the web&amp;#39;s evolution and its continued relevance in today&amp;#39;s rapidly changing technology landscape. Painter examines the protocol&amp;#39;s simplistic yet powerful nature, notably its stateless request/response framework, and how this has enabled a flexible and integrated web ecosystem. The blog also addresses the challenges and adaptations needed for modern applications, discussing alternative protocols like WebSockets and HTTP/3, yet emphasizing HTTP 1.1&amp;#39;s capabilities in providing fluid user experiences. With practical examples, like a collaborative document editing app, Painter showcases HTTP&amp;#39;s adaptability in meeting complex requirements of dynamic user interactions. This reflective piece is a must-read for anyone interested in the web&amp;#39;s past, present, and future, emphasizing the protocol&amp;#39;s versatility and importance in shaping the internet as we know it.</description>

      <title>Azure DevOps Podcast: Andrew Lock: Containers in .NET 8 - Episode 281</title>
      <link>http://azuredevopspodcast.clear-measure.com/andrew-lock-containers-in-net-8-episode-281</link>
      <description>Andrew Lock is a senior software engineer at Datadog, working out of Devon, in the UK. He is a Microsoft MVP, Author of  Core in Action, and has an active blog all about his experience working with .NET and  Core. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [3:08] What is Andrew working on these days? [3:42] The push towards open telemetry in .NET and the ecosystem in general. [4:49] In Andrew’s opinion, open telemetry is ready for use, but there is still much to learn. [6:58] The state of containers for .NET developers. [9:48] The use of chiseled containers. [15:46] Using chiseled containers for that extra level of security. [17:01] The different levels of chiseling. [19:04] What does it mean to be a self-contained ASP.NET application? [23:52] Other big container changes, including running as a non-root user and the default port inside the Docker container changing. [28:18] Port 8080 and the user App. [30:12] Windows containers for testing. [33:14] The repeatability of Dockers containers.   Mentioned in this Episode:     — New Video Podcast! Email us at .

      <title>The art of good code review</title>
      <link>https://philbooth.me/blog/the-art-of-good-code-review</link>
      <description>This post is an extension
to a talk I gave recently at work.
It was arranged at short notice
and the audience were experienced engineers,
so I kept it brief and tried not to be patronising.
But the feedback afterwards was quite positive
and there were some questions too,
so here&amp;#39;s the extended version
for anyone interested.
Note that our team conducts pre-merge reviews,
and some of the suggestions are specific to that context.
I actually prefer post-merge reviews,
but am yet to persuade everyone I work with
that they&amp;#39;re better.
Oh, and trigger warning:
this post contains opinions.</description>

      <title>MPAs vs SPAs: The False Dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://thomascothran.tech/2024/01/the-false-dichotomy-mpas-spas/</link>
      <description>This is the second post in the series “Have Clojure UIs Taken the Wrong Path?”. The first post is here.
How do we choose between building an application using a hypermedia approach versus the client-side SPA? This post won’t answer that question. But it will say how not to make that choice.
A common heuristic is the spectrum that stretches between old fashioned “Multi Page Apps” (MPAs) for basic use cases, to Single Page Applications for rich client interactivity.</description>

      <title>Leopard: Sublinear Verifier Inner Product Argument Under Discrete Logarithm Assumption</title>
      <link>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10198341</link>
      <description>An inner product (IP) argument is a proof system that convinces the verifier of an IP relation between committed integer vectors. IP arguments are crucial building blocks for range proof and zero knowledge arguments, which can be applied to verifiable computation, confidential transactions, decentralized identification, and so on. This paper proposes a novel efficient IP argument with a trustless setup. For integer vectors of size 
&amp;lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&amp;quot; xmlns:xlink=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tex-math notation=&amp;quot;LaTeX&amp;quot;&amp;gt;$N$ &amp;lt;/tex-math&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/inline-formula&amp;gt;
, the proposed IP argument provides a proof size of 
&amp;lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&amp;quot; xmlns:xlink=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tex-math notation=&amp;quot;LaTeX&amp;quot;&amp;gt;$O(\log _{2}{N})$ &amp;lt;/tex-math&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/inline-formula&amp;gt;
, a verification cost of 
&amp;lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&amp;quot; xmlns:xlink=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tex-math notation=&amp;quot;LaTeX&amp;quot;&amp;gt;$O(\sqrt {N})$ &amp;lt;/tex-math&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/inline-formula&amp;gt;
, and a size of public parameter size of 
&amp;lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&amp;quot; xmlns:xlink=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tex-math notation=&amp;quot;LaTeX&amp;quot;&amp;gt;$O(\sqrt {N})$ &amp;lt;/tex-math&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/inline-formula&amp;gt;
. The construction relies solely on the discrete logarithm (DL) assumption, a well-established standard cryptographic assumption. Consequently, we obtain the first DL-based IP argument with a trustless setup that achieves a sublinear verifier and logarithmic proof size, which we call Leopard. Furthermore, We empirically evaluate the performance of Leopard. The experimental results demonstrate that Leopard is highly efficient and scalable compared to previous works.</description>
