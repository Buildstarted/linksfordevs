      <description>Winnie Wu&amp;#39;s answer: Ok I give in because I got an A2A -- I don&amp;#39;t really consider this catastrophic, but it&amp;#39;s a funny story and I had people messaging me from all around the company telling me what a great laugh they had encountering this bug (including the team that had to fix it!):

      <title>Implicit Overflow Considered Harmful (and how to fix it)</title>
      <link>https://blog.polybdenum.com/2021/10/03/implicit-overflow-considered-harmful-and-how-to-fix-it.html</link>
      <description>A common problem in programming language design is the question of what the type of integral literals should be, and if they are untyped, what the rules for implicitly converting them to regular integer types should be. This is part of the more general problem of how to handle having multiple integer types with overflow and the conversions between them. There are many approaches to this problem, but they all have significant downsides.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty, Mental Shortcuts, and Errors in Technology Decisions</title>
      <link>https://parijatmishra.github.io/2021/10/03/decisions-uncertainty-heuristics.html</link>
      <description>If you are a technology leader, you know you make decisions, big or small, all the time. You also know that each decision carries some risk. Risks arise from several sources. We know how to mitigate many of the sources, but one of them is insidious: uncertainty due to lack of information. Behavioral phychologists and economists have spent decades researching how humans make decisions under uncertainty, and have found that a very wide variety of errors in decisions arise due to a few—just three, in fact—mental shortcuts humans use on a daily basis. These shortcuts, while useful in some circumstances, create systematic and even predictable errors. Sadly, we are largely unaware we are using them. In this article I will discuss what we know about how humans deal with uncertainty intuitively, the kinds of errors this can create, and how to identify and stop the mental shortcuts that can lead us to make errors. I hope this will help you increase the quality of your decisions and reduce risk, with only a little effort.</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20211004-00/?p=105754</link>
      <description>C++17 introduced std::optional&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; which lets you augment the values of a type T with a bonus value known as std::nullopt which semantically represents the absence of a value. A std::optional which holds the value std::nullopt is known as empty. The basic operations on std::optional are Checking if it holds a value (has_value()) Retrieving the value (value()) Assigning a value (=) Clearing the value and returning to the empty state (reset()) There are other lesser-known powers of the std::optional.</description>
