      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Jun/12/Adding-Additional-Mime-Mappings-to-the-Static-File-Provider</link>
      <description>If you're using the Static File Provider in ASP.NET Core you might need to add some additional extensions that are not handled by default. For example, if you host a Blazor site in your own application an additional mime mapping for `.dll` is required. Here how you can map extra extensions to the Static File middleware.</description>

      <description>People who don’t use credit don’t need credit scores! It’s that simple. The credit card industry uses scare tactics to convince you that you can’t live without their stupid score. The truth is you don’t need one.
Credit scores are how banks have bullied and brainwashed Americans into using more and more credit, going deeper and deeper into debt. And it’s worked. The average American has $10,000 in credit card debt and worries about their credit score.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Nix</title>
      <link>https://blog.ojizero.tech/posts/getting-started-with-nix/</link>
      <description>Nix, the purely functional package manager.
 The Nix package manager has been, on and off, on my radar for a couple of years now, the premise of it, using “functional programing”-esque behaviours in order to create a reproducible package management, seemed very intriguing! I mean you know, it has to be cool because it has purely functional in its tagline! This post is a beginning of a group of posts as I experiment and play around with Nix, partially inspired (and tagged under the same name) by this ongoing playlist from Shopify’s Burke Libbey, who’s videos reignited my interest in Nix, enough to starts attempting to move to solely using it!</description>

      <link>https://smaslennikov.com/blog/2020/06/12/dependence/</link>
      <description>Today’s innovations and progress swoop humanity into a neat cycle of anticipation and acquisition through deceptive notions that guide it to dependence. We’re sold on products and ideas through questionable but politically acceptable marketing tactics. We buy, pre-order, take out loans, only to supposedly upgrade later to a somehow inferior product.</description>

      <link>https://deniskyashif.com/2020/06/12/introduction-to-bimachines/</link>
      <description>Bimachines are deterministic finite-state devices that represent the class regular string functions and are commonly used for text rewriting. What is fascinating about them is that they process the input text in both directions - from left to right and from right to left which makes them very efficient in practice as they guarantee linear time input processing.</description>

      <title>Jepsen: PostgreSQL 12.3</title>
      <link>http://jepsen.io/analyses/postgresql-12.3</link>
      <description>PostgreSQL is a widely-known relational database system. We evaluated PostgreSQL using Jepsen’s new transactional isolation checker Elle, and found that transactions executed with serializable isolation on a single PostgreSQL instance were not, in fact, serializable. Under normal operation, transactions could occasionally exhibit G2-item: an anomaly involving a set of transactions which (roughly speaking) mutually fail to observe each other’s writes. In addition, we found frequent instances of G2-item under PostgreSQL “repeatable read”, which is explicitly proscribed by commonly-cited formalizations of repeatable read. As previously reported by Martin Kleppmann, this is due to the fact that PostgreSQL “repeatable read” is actually snapshot isolation. This behavior is allowable due to long-discussed ambiguities in the ANSI SQL standard, but could be surprising for users familiar with the literature. A patch for the bug we found in serializability is scheduled for the next minor release, on August 13th, and the presence of G2-item under repeatable read could be readily addressed through documentation. This work was performed independently, without compensation, and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy.</description>
