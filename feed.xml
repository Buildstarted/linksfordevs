      <title>Why do software developers love complexity?</title>
      <link>https://kyrylo.org/software/2025/08/21/why-do-software-developers-love-complexity.html</link>
      <description>The Great Pyramids took decades to build. It was a monumental feat of human ingenuity and collaboration. Today, we software developers erect our own pyramids each day - not from stone, but from code. Yet despite far more advanced tools, these systems don’t always make the experience better. So why, when KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is a well-known mantra, do we keep gravitating toward complexity?</description>

      <title>Using Devcontainers to Fix Coding Agent's Foibles</title>
      <link>https://dylanwatt.com/posts/2025-08-20-template/</link>
      <description>I’m publishing the template I use for AI Coded projects here.
For the last two years, I’ve been forcing myself to use AI to write as much of my code as possible, because I want to understand the technology’s weaknesses and strengths. Things started to take off with Cursor’s agent mode, and the release of Anthropics Sonnet 3.7 model and then Claude Code rocketed it to a place where it could write all of my code… with caveats.</description>

      <description>For months, my social feeds on Twitter (yes, I’m still calling it Twitter) and Reddit have been ablaze with chatter about Ani, xAI’s AI companion. When the company recently rolled out new virtual outfits, the buzz reached a fever pitch, and my curiosity finally got the better of me. I decided it was time to see what all the hype was about.After a quick app update, I was greeted by Ani herself. The first impression is… a lot. She leans into the frame, emphasizing her digital figure, sways gently,</description>

      <description>In this blog post, we’ll detail how attackers can exploit image scaling on Gemini CLI, Vertex AI Studio, Gemini’s web and API interfaces, Google Assistant, Genspark, and other production AI systems. We’ll also explain how to mitigate and defend against these attacks, and we’ll introduce Anamorpher, our open-source tool that lets you explore and generate these crafted images.</description>

      <title>Advice for Tech Non-Profits</title>
      <link>https://mitchellh.com/writing/advice-for-tech-nonprofits</link>
      <description>My family and I regularly contribute to various philanthropic causes.

compared to other causes.</description>

      <title>K-Nearest Neighbors – Running on Numbers</title>
      <link>https://runningonnumbers.com/posts/k-nearest-neighbors/</link>
      <description>Pitch tunneling is the art of deception. It’s a pitcher’s ability to make multiple, distinct pitches look identical as they leave the hand. From the batter’s perspective, two pitches can travel through the same “tunnel” partway to the plate before diverging. What looked like a hittable fastball suddenly drops off the table - a devastating curveball for a swinging strike. Effective tunneling neutralizes a batter’s ability to recognize a pitch, forcing a split-second, and often wrong, decision.</description>

      <title>what's up 🗒️ 💻</title>
      <link>https://epan.land/essays/2025-8_FancyRugDilemma</link>
      <description>This essay explores what I'll call the "Fancy Rug Effect" - how as means improve, abstract concepts gain value over practical ones. It also examines the corresponding dilemma: developing skills in the abstract increases the temptation to avoid practical problems. While not entirely new [1], hopefully this interpretation makes it more personal and possibly less ...fancy.</description>
