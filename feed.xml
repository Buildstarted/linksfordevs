      <title>Drapetomania - Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania</link>
      <description>Drapetomania was a conjectural mental illness that, in 1851, American physician Samuel A. Cartwright hypothesized as the cause of enslaved Africans fleeing captivity.[1]:41 Contemporarily reprinted in the South, Cartwright&amp;#39;s article was widely mocked and satirized in the northern United States. The concept has since been debunked as pseudoscience[2]:2 and shown to be part of the edifice of scientific racism.[3]</description>

      <title>Tearing Down a Humidifier - Lei&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.leiy.me/post/tear-down-humidifier/</link>
      <description>Last Black Friday, I got an Apple HomePod, so I’m in the process of hooking everything onto HomeKit.
(Nesthub, a Nest Thermostat to Apple HomeKit bridge in pure Golang,
was my most recent undertaking in this department.) Winters in New England can be pretty dry,
so we have a $40 humidifier 1 at home that, well, humidifies the room. Naturally, I want a HomeKit-enabled
humidifier. However, Apple’s website lists only one model currently on sale, and that model has a very
small water tank which won’t last even a day. Meanwhile, I have a Raspberry Pi Zero W lying around, so it seems
a good idea to put the Raspberry Pi into the humidifier to add HomeKit support. After all, everyone wants
a humidifier with an 1 GHz ARM processor inside, isn’t it?</description>

      <description>Around 2015, I started to realize that I was no longer part of Apple’s target audience. I’ve since found that Windows, and the devices available on the Windows side, from gaming laptops to convertibles to custom-built PCs, are just a better match for my requirements.</description>
