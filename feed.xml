You'll see more and more libraries updated to take advantage of React Hooks, so it's in your best interest to learn about them.

      <description>I am an engineer in electronic hardware development since 1994. The 3D printing and 3D design came to me in September 2019 and I really enjoy using these tools for my hobbies (or just for fun). My interests are retro computing and electronics. I like to develop new hardware for the 1980's Commodore C64 computer, which still seems to be popular among those, who ever owned one. </description>
