      <title>Insulation: first the body, then the home</title>
      <link>https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/02/body-insulation-thermal-underwear.html</link>
      <description>You could fill a library with reports and books describing the importance of energy-efficient heating systems and home insulation. However, not a word has been said or written about the energy savings potential of clothing, even though there has been a lot of progress in this area too. Modern thermal underclothing offers the possibility to turn the thermostat much lower without sacrificing comfort or sex appeal. The potential energy savings are huge; the costs are almost nil. This article explains through science and statistics how to maintain thermal comfort at any given indoor temperature using only clothes. Photo credit: Woolpower. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This article has been translated into French and Spanish. Over the last decades, both the insulation of homes...</description>

      <title>Top Articles I&amp;#39;ve Read in 2020</title>
      <link>https://bcmullins.github.io/top-articles-2020/</link>
      <description>Below are the top articles I’ve read in 2020. This year’s list contains a nice mix of types of articles. A prominent theme in the list is economics and economic methodology with A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas, Economic Modelling as Robustness Analysis, and Thoughts on DSGE Macroeconomics. The Theory of Interstellar Trade is an oddball article from a young Paul Krugman. An introduction to (algorithmic) randomness is an excellent invitation to a technical area of mathematical logic, and Comments on Economic Models, Economics, and Economists is a fun and effective book review on methodology. Finally, there’s four thought provoking articles across political rhetoric, machine learning privacy, social contract theory, and international relations with The Paranoid Style in American Politics, Stealing Machine Learning Models via Prediction APIs, Self-organizing moral systems, The End of Grand Strategy.
