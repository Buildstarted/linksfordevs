      <title>Episode 29: Snapshot Testing with Simon Cropp</title>
      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0029-snapshottesting/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Simon Cropp to chat about a form of testing called Snapshot testing! Simon is the author of Verify, which is a library that I’m quickly discovering is going to save me a HUGE amount of time when writing tests in dotnet! We chatted about snapshot testing in general; the various helper extensions that Verify has, which adds support for lots of different technologies; and also about testing in general.</description>

      <title>I called AdjustTokenPrivileges, but I was still told that a necessary privilege was not held, redux</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20211126-00/?p=105973</link>
      <description>A customer had a service and wanted to change some token information. The information that they wanted to change required Se&amp;#173;Tcb&amp;#173;Privilege, so they adjusted their token privileges to enable that privilege, but the call still failed with ERROR_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD: “A required privilege is not held by the client.”</description>

      <title>Involve clients in the feedback loop</title>
      <link>https://bruno-oliveira.github.io/techblog/Involve-clients-in-the-feedback-loop/</link>
      <description>One of the biggest struggles for any product-based company is to know exactly what to build. What to build is really important because that’s what ends up driving your business forward and it’s also the only way to attract, and eventually retain customers. Then, word of mouth, will do a lot of the “marketing” in spreading the word and expand the influence of your product to prospective new customers and that’s how part of the initial growth can happen.
