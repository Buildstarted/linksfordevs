      <title>Practice and Experience — bayindirh</title>
      <link>https://blog.bayindirh.io/blog/practice-and-experience/</link>
      <description>During my lifetime, I have met with people who had certain skills, like reading the weather, or knowing a technical subject inside out, or being able to learn pretty quickly while being thorough. I have admired these people, and wanted to learn what made them tick. The main question was &amp;quot;How is this possible, and what can I learn from these people&amp;quot;, and the feeling accompanying this question was always a healthy wonder and awe, not envy or anger.</description>

      <title>Nugs And Negative Failure Demand</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/nugs-and-negative-failure-demand/</link>
      <description>In this article I’m going to take a look at software quality as a way to
differentiate between junior, mid-level, and senior software engineers, through
the lens of failure demand, purely so that I can introduce a new concept that
I thought up on a walk today, which I’m calling negative failure demand.</description>

      <description>Our performance ratings influence our ability to get raises, promotions, and our long term career success. They&amp;#39;re not a simple meritocracy, but are a coarse-grained way of estimating our value to our company. Here&amp;#39;s a bit on making certain you get a rating you deserve.</description>

      <description>Wayland does not support screen savers: it does not have any provision that allows screen savers to even exist in any meaningful way. If you value screen savers, that&amp;#39;s kind of a problem. Why doesn&amp;#39;t it? Well, I suppose the designers of Wayland have no joy in their cold, black hearts simply do not value screen savers. I suspect that some day someone will graft screen saver support onto ...</description>

      <title>How to write a renderer for modern graphics APIs</title>
      <link>https://blog.mecheye.net/2023/09/how-to-write-a-renderer-for-modern-apis/</link>
      <description>Tell me if this sounds familiar. You want to write a renderer. OpenGL seems beginner-friendly, and there’s lots of tutorials for you to get started, but you also know it’s deprecated, kind of dead, and mocked; not for “real graphics programmers”, whatever that means. Its replacement, Vulkan, seems daunting and scary to learn, tutorials seem to spin for hours without seeing a single pixel on the screen, and by the time you’re done, you’re no closer to making that low-latency twitchy multiplayer FPS game you’ve always wanted to make.</description>

      <title>Vector search for dummies</title>
      <link>https://philbooth.me/blog/vector-search-for-dummies</link>
      <description>Recently I built a system
that uses vector search to logically truncate long documents
and retain the most significant parts
according to some search term.
I&amp;#39;m a dummy,
with no background in machine learning or mathematics,
so there were new concepts for me to understand
and implementation details to figure out.
This post summarises what I learned.</description>

      <title>Why is Bitwarden returning 503s to my Windows app?</title>
      <link>https://www.lkoskela.fi/blog/2023-09-02-wden-windows-503/</link>
      <description>For a few years now, I&amp;#39;ve been developing a TUI Bitwarden client app called Wden. While Bitwarden does not have a stable API for writing alternative clients, the APIs for the official clients have been pretty well documented by third parties. It&amp;#39;s not too difficult to write a client against those, but it will occasionally break when Bitwarden makes changes to their servers.</description>
