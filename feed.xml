      <title>Keyboards, Cloud Costs, Static Analysis, and Philosophy</title>
      <link>https://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/keyboards-cloud-costs-static-analysis-and-philosophy/</link>
      <description>Michael Outlaw is a father, husband, and software developer based out of Atlanta, GA. A fan of gadgets and all things technology, when he isn’t found behind the clickety clack of his favorite mechanical keyboard he’s usually found riding a bicycle on his favorite road or trail systems. A father of two boys, Michael often spends his free time teaching his boys how to lose with dignity as they destroy him in game franchises like Overwatch, Halo, and Call of Duty. When not sharing his love of Git, C#, and unit testing, he can be found spending his “study time” studying the sounds of guitar and music theory.</description>

      <description>I am no NixOS expert by any means, I only recently switched to it as my daily driver. I have rebuilt my workstation and home server on top of it, and am in the process of rebuilding my public facing server with it, too. Nevertheless, when I read Xe Iaso&amp;#39;s latest blog post, and the ensuing discussion on lobste.rs, I had Thoughts.</description>

      <title>Deshittifying the Internet of Things starts with me. – Supermechanical</title>
      <link>https://blog.supermechanical.com/2023/10/15/deshittifying-the-internet-of-things-starts-with-me/</link>
      <description>What was once a promise of technology to allow us to automate and analyze the environments in our physical spaces is now a heap of broken ideas and broken products. Technology products have been deployed en masse, our personal data collected and sold without our consent, and then abandoned as soon as companies strip mined all the profit they thought they could wring out. And why not? They already have our money.</description>
