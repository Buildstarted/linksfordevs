      <title>Ultra Cheap VPS hosts for Tor Bridges</title>
      <link>https://worldofmatthew.com/post/webhosting-for-tor-bridge/</link>
      <description>EAs of the 5th July 2020, there are 1357 Tor bridges available for users in countries who censor the Tor network to use. Having just over 1,000 IP addresses is not a lot for such a big privacy network as Tor is, especially considering that the number of Tor Bridges peaked at 4,227 on the 4th January 2015. That means since then the network has lost more than two-thirds of its bridges.</description>

      <link>https://www.bargava.com/blog/disrupt-enterprise-search/</link>
      <description>We, human beings, are quite good at processing new information, but are terrible in storing them in long-term memory(LTM). LTM is finite and very limited. Many centuries ago, the printing press took a giant step in alleviating this problem. And then, distribution boomed. The number of printed content exploded.
Humans are a sucker for information. How do you find if the information you are searching for exist in that book?</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core Series: Route To Code</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-33Uz32hG0</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud ready, connected applications

In this episode, Ryan Nowak shows us a feature in ASP.NET Core called route to code that allows us to quickly create HTTP endpoints with some of the additional work that comes along with controllers.

[00:57] - Where would you use route to rode?
[02:49] - Getting started Demo
[05:47] - Using the service provider 
[08:58] - Additional JSON methods for HTTP client 
[12:18] - Choosing to use route to code

      <title>Concurrent Reference Counting and Resource Management in Wait-free Constant Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07053</link>
      <description>A common problem when implementing concurrent programs is efficiently
protecting against unsafe races between processes reading and then using a
resource (e.g., memory blocks, file descriptors, or network connections) and
other processes that are concurrently overwriting and then destructing the same
resource. Such read-destruct races can be protected with locks, or with
lock-free solutions such as hazard-pointers or read-copy-update (RCU).
  In this paper we describe a method for protecting read-destruct races with
expected constant time overhead, $O(P^2)$ space and $O(P^2)$ delayed destructs,
and with just single word atomic memory operations (reads, writes, and CAS). It
is based on an interface with four primitives, an acquire-release pair to
protect accesses, and a retire-eject pair to delay the destruct until it is
safe. We refer to this as the acquire-retire interface. Using the
acquire-retire interface, we develop simple implementations for three common
use cases: (1) memory reclamation with applications to stacks and queues, (2)
reference counted objects, and (3) objects manage by ownership with moves,
copies, and destructs. The first two results significantly improve on previous
results, and the third application is original. Importantly, all operations
have expected constant time overhead.</description>

▶SEND ME THEORY QUESTIONS◀
ryan.e.dougherty@icloud.com

▶ABOUT ME◀
I am a professor of Computer Science, and am passionate about CS theory. I have taught over 12 courses at Arizona State University, as well as Colgate University, including several sections of undergraduate theory.

▶ABOUT THIS CHANNEL◀
The theory of computation is perhaps the fundamental theory of computer science. It sets out to define, mathematically, what exactly computation is, what is feasible to solve using a computer, and also what is not possible to solve using a computer. The main objective is to define a computer mathematically, without the reliance on real-world computers, hardware or software, or the plethora of programming languages we have in use today. The notion of a Turing machine serves this purpose and defines what we believe is the crux of all computable functions.

This channel is also about weaker forms of computation, concentrating on two classes: regular languages and context-free languages. These two models help understand what we can do with restricted means of computation, and offer a rich theory using which you can hone your mathematical skills in reasoning with simple machines and the languages they define. 

However, they are not simply there as a weak form of computation--the most attractive aspect of them is that problems formulated on them are tractable, i.e. we can build efficient algorithms to reason with objects such as finite automata, context-free grammars and pushdown automata. For example, we can model a piece of hardware (a circuit) as a finite-state system and solve whether the circuit satisfies a property (like whether it performs addition of 16-bit registers correctly). We can model the syntax of a programming language using a grammar, and build algorithms that check if a string parses according to this grammar.

On the other hand, most problems that ask properties about Turing machines are undecidable. This Youtube channel will help you see and prove that several tasks involving Turing machines are unsolvable---i.e., no computer, no software, can solve it. For example, you will see that there is no software that can check whether a  C program will halt on a particular input. To prove something is possible is, of course, challenging. But to show something is impossible is rare in computer science, and very humbling.</description>

      <title>Dark Patterns after the GDPR: Scraping Consent Pop-ups and Demonstrating their Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02479</link>
      <description>New consent management platforms (CMPs) have been introduced to the web to
conform with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, particularly its
requirements for consent when companies collect and process users' personal
data. This work analyses how the most prevalent CMP designs affect people's
consent choices. We scraped the designs of the five most popular CMPs on the
top 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied
consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8% meet the minimal requirements that we set
based on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40
participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent
choices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect;
removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22--23
percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page
decreases consent by 8--20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical
basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular
the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an
effective way to increase compliance.</description>

      <description>Testing gives confidence in written code. In the context of this article, ‘testing’ means ‘automated testing’. Without automated testing, it is significantly harder to ensure the quality of a web application of significant complexity. Fails caused by automated testing may lead to more bugs in production. In this article, we’re going to show how React developers can quickly start testing their app with the React Testing Library (RTL).</description>
