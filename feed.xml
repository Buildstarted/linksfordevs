      <title>Terry Lambert&amp;#39;s answer to What’s your opinion about macOS Big Sur?</title>
      <link>https://www.quora.com/What-s-your-opinion-about-macOS-Big-Sur/answer/Terry-Lambert?ch=2&amp;srid=povO</link>
      <description>From what I’ve seen of the beta, they’ve taken precisely the wrong approach, in forcing third party drivers out of the kernel and into user space. Obviously their point in doing this was to ensure driver portability between x86 and ARM; what they’ve done, instead, given the development model for most peripheral companies that need device drivers for their devices to be usable on an OS, is orphan all existing hardware of that class. Probably uo are going to have to be buying a new printer, in particular, because once they are working, like cell phone manufacturers oof Android phones, there is never an update to the driver. The hardware device companies have very limited software engineering resources, and they will put them to the next device — like the next model of printer — and totally “screw anyone” who is no longer giving them money, because It’s All About The Benjamins™. They did this in the switch to PPC, and they did it again in the switch from PPC to Intel. It means having to re-buy perfectly good peripheral hardware, because no one will write a driver for it for the new architecture. Apple is wrong about the “if the driver is in user space, the manufacturer will surely just recompile!”. They won’t. It doesn’t sell new devices for them, and for loss-leader products like printers, it doesn’t sell more ink cartridges on the older printers where the DRM has been broken, and most ink cartridges are now purchased from third parties, rather than the manufacturer of the printer. Note: It was in fact entirely possible to run third party kernel drivers in such a way that they believed they were running in kernel space, but run them under Rosetta. Apple simply fell down on the job here. Again.</description>

      <title>How to create a QR Code generator with Azure Functions</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/create-qr-code-generator-azure-function/</link>
      <description>This post is about creating a QR Code generator using Azure Functions. A QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) first designed in 1994 for the automotive industry in Japan. QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application. I will be using a library - QRCoder to generate the QR Code for a URL. So first I have created a function with Http Trigger.</description>

      <title>Watch out for .NET Core Runtime Bitness for IIS Installs</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Nov/25/Watch-out-for-NET-Core-Runtime-Bitness-for-IIS-Installs</link>
      <description>I recently ran into a snag with one of the my Windows Server installs of an upgraded .NET Core 5.0 application. It turns out I didn&amp;#39;t install .NET Core 5.0 correctly because I made some bad assumptions of what I needed to install to run my application, even though it previously ran on .NET Core 3.1. Here&amp;#39;s more detail on what the failure looks like and how to properly install .NET Core 5.0. </description>

      <title>Caching - Simply Explained</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FyXURRVmR0</link>
      <description>What is a cache? How does it work, and why is it important?

Caches are used everywhere in our modern devices. It&amp;#39;s found in many hardware components and throughout software. The goal of caching is to store data from slow memory into fast memory so it can be retrieved quicker.

That&amp;#39;s why browsers keep a cache: so they don&amp;#39;t have to re-download everything from the internet over and over again.

      <title>Reliably Save State &amp;amp; Publish Events (Outbox Pattern)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8fOnxAxKHk</link>
      <description>What&amp;#39;s the Outbox Pattern? A reliable way of saving state to your database and publishing a message/event to a message broker.

Why do you need it? When you get into messaging, you will often find code that needs to save state to your database, and then publish an message/event to a message broker.  Unfortunately because they are two different resources, you need a distributed transaction to make these atomic.  There is another option to use the Outbox Pattern which does not require a distributed transaction and most messaging libraries support it.
