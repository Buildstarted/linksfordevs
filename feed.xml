He talks to use about the need for autoscaling Kubernetes workloads and how KEDA helps to realize that pattern. He provides tips for using KEDA and a roadmap of new features.</description>

      <title>deWiTTERS Game Loop – deWiTTERS</title>
      <link>https://dewitters.com/dewitters-gameloop/</link>
      <description>The game loop is the heartbeat of every game, no 		  game can run without it. But unfortunately for every 		  new game programmer, there aren’t any good articles 		  on the internet who provide the proper information 		  on this topic. But fear not, because you have just 		  stumbled upon the one and only article that gives 		  the game loop the attention it deserves.  Thanks to my job as a game programmer, I come into 		  contact with a lot of code for small mobile 		  games. And it always amazes me how many game loop 		  implementations are out there. You might wonder 		  yourself how a simple thing like that can be written 		  in different ways. Well, it can, and I will discuss 		  the pros and cons of the most popular 		  implementations, and give you the (in my opinion) 		  best solution of implementing a game loop.</description>

      <link>https://exceptionless.com/why-we-upgraded-our-production-application-to-net-5-0/</link>
      <description>For anyone who has built an application, you’ve probably built it on some library or framework that changes over time. To keep up, you have to upgrade your application. However, there are varying schools of thought around when you should upgrade. At Exceptionless, we like to be on the bleeding edge. As an open-source company, we feel a responsibility to the community to know and understand the open-source tools we use. As such, we have already upgraded Exceptionless to use .NET … Continued</description>

      <title>Shukri Abdullahi - Through Programming I Became a Better Artist [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqxf-shA0UQ</link>
      <description>Code is my new favorite artistic medium. Creating art was once the only activity that put me in a flow state that was until I started coding. Programming like art is full of processes, speed bumps, errors, eustress, and joy. My skills as an artist have proven to be an asset in programming. While programming has cultivated artistic improvements.

What: More artists should learn to code.
Why: You’re skills as an artist are an asset in the programming world and vice versa programming can cultivate artistic improvements.
How: Personal Anecdote detailing skills.

      <title>Inside C++/WinRT: How does C++/WinRT represent ABI types? | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200924-00/?p=104275</link>
      <description>C++/WinRT offers a high-level interface to the the low-level Windows Runtime ABI (application binary interface). It does this without any dependency on the Windows header files, which means that it needs some way to talk about the ABI types without actually using the ABI types.</description>

      <description>Language is a core component of the human condition. According to the Washington Post, at least 50% of the world’s population is bilingual. That’s a fantastic statistic, that means every second user to our application could be bilingual. Sadly, most app implementations do not support multiple languages and could be missing serving an audience.</description>

      <title>Method `.item()` for Arrays, Typed Arrays, and strings</title>
      <link>https://2ality.com/2020/09/item-method.html</link>
      <description>The ECMAScript proposal “.item()” (by Shu-yu Guo and Tab Atkins) introduces the mentioned method for indexable values (Arrays, Typed Arrays, strings). Given an index, the method returns the corresponding element. Its key benefit is that indices can be negative (-1 gets the last element, -2 the second last, etc.). This blog post examines .item() in detail.</description>

      <title>Blackfacts and the Wakanda Technology Platform - Technology By Us, for Us, About Us [w/ASL]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7bWu5_I-QQ</link>
      <description>The subject of 'Inclusion' in the Tech Industry is a hot topic today.

In 1990, when my employer at the time declined to offer to reimburse me for programming classes I was thinking of taking, the only thing I asked them for was to amend my employment agreement to not claim ownership of anything I built, or in other words, not get in my way.

They agreed, and I taught myself to code by reading books and launched a programming career that has now spanned close to three decades.

When I was able to quit that job a couple of years later from revenue from a product I wrote in my basement apartment, I realized the wide open opportunities available in the world of technology, and committed myself to creating technologies to help 'Bring Communities of Color Into the Information Age.'

Today, I have built a technology platform that powers my 23-years-running website Blackfacts.com, designed to provide Black schools, organizations and businesses with content and technology services on a global basis.

This talk will describe and demonstrate some of the components of the platform, called the Wakanda Technology Platform, inspired by a sub-text of the fictional nation of Wakanda, who was able to protect its culture and people because they were in possession of superior technology.
