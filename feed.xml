      <title>The darker side of being a doctor</title>
      <link>https://drericlevi.substack.com/p/the-darker-side-of-being-a-doctor</link>
      <description>I’m a surgeon. I’d like to think that I’m resilient and well adjusted, having gone through medical school and rigorous surgical training. I’ve been a doctor for 13 years and much of that period has been spent training to be as good a surgeon as I could ever be. I have great family support, a physician wife who understands my work and I’ve never been diagnosed with a mental illness.</description>

      <description>Hurl is a dynamically-typed programming language that uses
exception handling as its only form of control flow.
Much of the syntax is unsurprising, but the forms of exception raising and
handling deserve close examination.</description>

      <description>Ask ten developers how they think a certain piece of code should be formatted,
and you&amp;#39;ll likely get ten different opinions. Worse, these opinions are almost
never based on facts. Instead, when you ask why they prefer style X over Y the
answer is almost always the equivalent of &amp;quot;I just do&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, especially in high-traffic scenarios, you absolutely need to ensure that only one process can modify a piece of data at a time. Entity Framework Core is a fantastic tool, but it doesn&amp;#39;t have a direct mechanism for pessimistic locking. In this article, I&amp;#39;ll show you how we can solve that problem with raw SQL queries.</description>

      <title>Notes on Learning Japanese</title>
      <link>https://alexanderweichart.de/2_Areas/Japanese/Notes-on-Learning-Japanese</link>
      <description>12.04.2024 A random stream of consciousness on learning Japanese. it is a great joy to learn such a logical and beautiful language with very few exceptions or rules you have to learn by heart it feels like playing Lego for example: 食べる(“taberu”) (to eat) replace ending “ru” with “tai”: 食べたい (“tabetai”) (want to eat) replace “i” with “kunai”: 食べたくない(“tabetakunai”) (do not want to eat) replace “i” with “katta”: 食べたかった (“tabetakunakutta”) (did not want to eat) words are ‘conjugated’ by attaching helper words in a sense, it’s similar to functional programming however, every now and then learning Japanese feels impossible like a mountain that’s too high to climb spending the few hours I have left each day after work and chores in an artificial Japanese environment consisting of recursively reviewing Anki flashcards writing out Kanji and watching Japanese videos just to progress forward a bit and not forget what I’ve learned so far knowing full well it’s no natural way to acquire the language but having no other choice since I’m stuck on the other side of the world limited by time and not at the point yet where I can fully “immerse” myself yet I sometimes wish I could just go Japan not just for a two week vacation but for a few years not just as a foreign tourist but as a someone who ‘lives there’ but I’m also fully aware of my inability to speak the language fluently find a job there or live a ‘normal’ live in Japan so I stop thinking about it and enter my artificial environment again since it’s the best tool I have right now to make this wish a reality .</description>

      <title>Ten Years and Counting: My Affair with Microservices</title>
      <link>https://blog.allegro.tech/2024/04/ten-years-microservices.html</link>
      <description>In early 2024, I hit ten years at Allegro, which also happens to be how long I’ve been working with microservices.
This timespan also roughly corresponds to how long the company as a whole has been using them, so I think it’s a good time to outline the story of project
Rubicon: a very ambitious gamble which completely changed how we work and what our software is like. The idea probably seemed rather extreme at the time, yet I
am certain that without this change, Allegro would not be where it is today, or perhaps would not be there at all.

      <title>YouTube’s Screen Stealer</title>
      <link>https://joe-steel.com/2024-04-12-YouTubes-Screen-Stealer.html</link>
      <description>Something&amp;#39;s distinctly different about this &amp;quot;aerial&amp;quot; still frame.

Yesterday, I had the YouTube app open on my Apple TV in my office. I went to do something else, and when I looked back it wasn’t the Apple TV aerial screensaver, but a YouTube app “screen saver” with a slideshow of heavily compressed still images.
The Apple TV in my living room had an older version of the YouTube app (presumably from April 2nd if the dates in the version names are to be believed.) That version didn’t try to override my screensaver like the one in my office.
It seems the YouTube app, if the app is open, will start a screensaver slideshow of generic still images taken from videos if there isn’t a video that I’ve paused.
Look at the compression shred this still.

If there is a paused video it will be a slideshow of the YouTube thumbnail art endlessly zooming in, fading to black, and starting over.
Some of the worst sins of mankind exist in YouTube thumbnails, and they’re not designed to be screensavers.
You know what is designed to be a screensaver? The Apple TV’s aerial screensaver. Far and away the most lauded feature of the Apple TV platform. Beloved by all (except people that get creeped out by jellyfish) and yet replaced by either chunky-compressed stills from drone footage, or looping thumbnails.
To top it all off, it has static, white text (famously the best to use for screensavers) for video details, static YouTube logo, and a graphic for the directional pad, indicating that pressing the top will start playing the video being used in the screensaver. If you have an older Apple TV in your house (my office Apple TV is the 4th gen one) with the awful touchpad you can even trigger it when you try and pick up the remote from the furniture.
YouTube’s not the first company to “innovate” in the screensaver space, and it’s not exclusive to the Apple TV. A few years ago my boyfriend had a set-top box that would initial start a slideshow of ugly nature photos, and then after a while they started dropping in ads into the slideshow.
I fully expect YouTube’s aim here is to capitalize on all this “free” real estate and start sliding in ads, promoting specific videos from partners, or showcasing movies available to rent or buy. I know that’s cynical, but so is YouTube as a business.
Setting that aside, I pay for YouTube Premium because the ads are so awful I can’t stand them, but because there’s some pretense of this being a screensaver I still get these slideshows that are the future home of ads for other people.
On April 4th, Janko Roettgers published a piece about a recent Roku patent filing about injecting ads over the source input feed when the source input feed is paused. The patent also says the display device will discern content and context to place a relevant ad over the paused video stream.
As Janko points out, Roku already monetizes screensavers on its platform. Feel free to peruse Roku’s site where they brag about chunks of the screen they’re willing to sell.
I don’t think advertising, in the abstract, is evil. I do, however, think it’s insidious to inject advertising into every pore —especially when those pores don’t belong to you, like when you’re the YouTube app, not even a platform.

If you want to bypass the YouTube app change, I heard from Rob Bhalla on Mastodon that if you change the screensaver to start at 2 minutes, instead of the Apple TV’s default 5 minutes, then the Apple TV’s screensaver kicks in before the YouTube one and you never see theirs. Thanks to  YouTube not having any screensaver controls, and no idea what your actual screensaver settings on the Apple TV are, they hard coded in a start time just prior to the default 5 minutes.
That’s how you know it’s really there to help improve user experience, and not just a craven money grab by absolute hacks.
Sure, they might change this to start even earlier. In which case, we’re at the mercy of Apple to protect customer experience. I wouldn’t hold my breath on that one. App Store rejections are for indie devs, and people trying to skirt giving Apple money, not YouTube overriding the screensaver.</description>

      <description>I built a magical meme search engine using siglip/CLIP and vector encoding images. It was a fun way to learn about this powerful technology. I&amp;#39;m sharing the code so you can build your own and discover forgotten gems in your photo library. Let&amp;#39;s unleash the power of AI on our images!</description>

      <title>Data-as-a-Product and Data-Contract: An evolutionary approach to data maturity</title>
      <link>https://blog.owulveryck.info/2024/04/09/data-as-a-product-and-data-contract-an-evolutionary-approach-to-data-maturity.html</link>
      <description>Using Simon Wardley’s evolution model, I propose a framework for visualizing the maturity of data within a business context, emphasizing the importance of treating data as a product and implementing data contracts to facilitate integration and ensure trust. Ultimately, I suggest that starting with a focus on data-as-a-product is crucial for organizations embarking on their data mesh journey, paving the way for a comprehensive and agile transformation.</description>

      <title>asymmetric routing around the firewall</title>
      <link>https://devnonsense.com/posts/asymmetric-routing-around-the-firewall/</link>
      <description>This is a follow-up to my previous post about some mysterious TCP connection timeouts in the UC Berkeley wired network.
I received many thoughtful emails in response to that post, and there was an excellent discussion on Hacker News. I’m very grateful to everyone who spent time helping with my ridiculous home networking issues.
Since then, I’ve learned some new information that (mostly) solves the mystery. In this post, I’ll first summarize the main theories people suggested, then tell the story of how a Bunny CDN engineer came to the rescue, and finally describe the root cause.</description>
