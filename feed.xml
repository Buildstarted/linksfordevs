      <description>If xx is a number and x^\hat x is its approximation, then the are two notions of
error:
 absolute errror: ∣x−x^∣|x - \hat x|. relative error: ∣x−x^∣/∣x∣|x - \hat x|/|x|. 
Since the relative error is invariant under scaling (x↦αx)(x \mapsto \alpha x), we
will mostly be interested in relative error.
 &amp;#167;  Significant digits
The significant digits in a number are the first nonzero digit and all
succeeding digits. Thus 1.7320 has five significant digits. 0.0491 has
only three significant digits.
It is not transparent to me why this definition is sensible.
 &amp;#167;  Correct Significant digits --- a first stab
We can naively define x^\hat x agrees to xx upto pp significant digits
if x^\hat x and xx round to the same number upto pp significant digits.
This definition is seriously problematic. Consider the numbers:
 x=0.9949x = 0.9949, x1=1.0x_1 = 1.0, x2=0.99x_2 = 0.99, x3=0.9950x_3 = 0.9950 y=0.9951y = 0.9951, y1=1.0y_1 = 1.0, y2=1.0y_2 = 1.0, y3=0.9950y_3 = 0.9950
Here, yy has correct one and three significant digits relative to xx,
but incorrect 2 significant digits, since the truncation at x2x_2 and y2y_2 
do not agree even to the first significant digit.
 &amp;#167;  Correct Significant digits --- the correct definition
We say that x^\hat x agress to xx upto pp significant digits if ∣x−x^∣|x - \hat x|
is less than half a unit in the pth significant digit of xx.
 &amp;#167;  Accuracy v/s precision
 Accuracy: absolute or relative error of a quantity. Precision: accuracy with which basic arithmetic +, -, *, / are performed.for floating point, measured by unit round-off (we have not met this yet).
Accuracy is not limited by precision: By using fixed precision arithmetic,
we can emulate arbitrary precision arithmetic. The problem is that often
this emulation is too expensive to be useful.
 &amp;#167;  Backward, Forward errors
Let y=f(x)y = f(x), where f:R→Rf: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R. Let us compute y^\hat y as an approximation to 
yy, in an arithmetic of precision uu. How do we measure the quality of y^\hat y?
 In many cases, we maybe happy with an y^\hat y such that the relative error betweenyy and y^\hat y is equal to uu: we did the best we can with the precisionthat was given. This is the forward error.  An alternative question we can ask is, for what δx\delta x do we have that y^=f(x+δx)\hat y = f(x + \delta x). That is, how far away from the input do we need to stray, to get a matching output? There maybe many such δx\delta x,so we ask for min⁡∣δx∣\min |\delta x|. We can divide this error by xx as a normalization factor. This is the backward error.

There are two reasons we prefer backward error.
 It converts error analysis into &amp;quot;data analysis&amp;quot;. The data itself tendsto be uncertain. If the error given by the backward analysis is smallerthan the data uncertainty, then we can write off our error as beingtoo small. Since for all we know, we have &amp;#39;fixed&amp;#39; the uncertain datawith our small error. It reduces the question of error analysis into perturbation theory,which is very well understood for a large class of problems.
 &amp;#167;  Backward stable
A method for computing y=f(x)y = f(x) is called backward stable
if it produces a y^\hat y with small backward error. That is, we need a 
small δx\delta x such that y^=f(x+δx)\hat y = f(x + \delta x).
 &amp;#167;  Mixed forward-backward error
We assume that addition and subtraction are backward stable, where uu
is the number of significant digits to which our arithmetic operations
can be performed:
x&amp;#177;y=x(1+Δ)&amp;#177;y(1+Δ)∀∣Δ∣≤u
x \pm y = x(1 + \Delta) \pm y(1 + \Delta) \forall |\Delta| \leq u

Another type of error we can consider is that of the form:
y^+δy=f(x+Δx)                                                                              
\hat y + \delta y = f(x + \Delta x)

That is, for a small perturbation in the output (δy)(\delta y), we can get a
backward error of δx\delta x. This is called as mixed forward backward error.

We can say that an algorithm with mixed-forward-backward-error is stable iff:
y^+δy=f(x+Δx)∣Δy∣/∣y^∣&amp;lt;ϵ∣Δx∣/∣x^∣&amp;lt;ηϵ,η&amp;#160;are&amp;#160;small
\begin{aligned}
&amp;amp;\hat y + \delta y = f(x + \Delta x) \\
&amp;amp;|\Delta y|/|\hat y| &amp;lt; \epsilon \\
&amp;amp;|\Delta x|/|\hat x| &amp;lt; \eta \\
&amp;amp;\text{$\epsilon, \eta$ are small}
\end{aligned}

This definition of stability is useful when rounding errors are the dominant
form of errors.
 &amp;#167;  Conditioning
Relationship between forward and backward error is govered by conditioning:
the sensitivity of solutions to perturbations of data. Let us have an approximate
solution y^=f(x+δx)\hat y = f(x + \delta x). Then:
y^−y=f(x+δx)−f(x)=f′(x)δx+O((δx)2)(y^−y)/y=(xf′(x)/f(x))(Δx/x)+O((Δx)2)(y^−y)/y=c(x)(Δx/x)+O((Δx)2)c(x)≡∣xf′(x)/f(x)∣
\begin{aligned}
&amp;amp;\hat y - y = f(x + \delta x) - f(x) = f&amp;#39;(x) \delta x + O((\delta x)^2) \\
&amp;amp;(\hat y - y)/y = (x f&amp;#39;(x)/f(x)) (\Delta x/x) + O((\Delta x)^2) \\
&amp;amp;(\hat y - y)/y = c(x) (\Delta x/x) + O((\Delta x)^2)\\
&amp;amp;c(x) \equiv |x f&amp;#39;(x)/f(x)|
\end{aligned}

The quantity c(x)c(x) measures the scaling factor to go from the relative
change in output to the relative change in input. Note that this is a property
of the function ff, not any particular algorithm.
 &amp;#167;  Example: log⁡x\log x
If f(x)=log⁡xf(x) = \log x, then c(x)=∣(x(log⁡x)′)/log⁡x∣=∣1/log⁡x∣c(x) = |(x (\log x)&amp;#39;) / \log x| = |1/\log x|. This
quantity is very large for x≃1x \simeq 1. So, a small change in xx can 
produce a drastic change in log⁡x\log x around 11.
 Note the the absolute change is quite small: log⁡(x+δx)≃log⁡x+δx/x\log(x + \delta x) \simeq \log x + \delta x/x.However, relative to log⁡x\log x, this change of δx/x\delta x/x is quite large.
 &amp;#167;  Rule of thumb
We now gain access to the useful rule:
forward&amp;#160;error≲condition&amp;#160;number&amp;#215;backward&amp;#160;error
\text{forward error} \lesssim \text{condition number} \times \text{backward error}

 Glass half empty: Ill-conditioned problems can have large forward error. Glass half full: Well-conditioned problems do not amplify error in data.
 &amp;#167;  Forward stable
If a method produces answers with forward errors of similar magnitude to those
produced by a backward stable method, then it is called forward stable. 
Backward stability implies forward stability, but not vice-versa (TODO: why?)
 &amp;#167;  Cancellation
Consider the following program:
#include &amp;lt;cmath&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

int main() {
    double x = 12e-9;
    double c = cos(x);
    double one_sub_c = 1 - c;
    double denom = x*x;
    double yhat = one_sub_c / denom;

    printf(&amp;quot;x:         %20.16f\n&amp;quot;
           &amp;quot;cx:        %20.16f\n&amp;quot;
           &amp;quot;one_sub_c: %20.16f\n&amp;quot;
           &amp;quot;denom:     %20.16f\n&amp;quot;
           &amp;quot;yhat:      %20.16f\n&amp;quot;,
            x, c, one_sub_c, denom, yhat); 
}

which produces the output:
x:           0.0000000120000000
cx:          0.9999999999999999
one_sub_c:   0.0000000000000001
denom:       0.0000000000000001
yhat:        0.7709882115452477

This is clearly wrong, because we know that (1−cos⁡x)/x2)≤1/2(1-\cos x)/x^2) \leq 1/2.
The reason for this terrible result is that:
 we know cos⁡x\cos x to high accuracy, since xx was some fixed quantity. 1−cos⁡x1 - \cos x converted the error in cos⁡x\cos x into its value. 1−cos⁡x1 - \cos x has only one significant figure. This makes it practically useless for anything else we are interested in doing.
In general:
x≡1+ϵerror&amp;#160;of&amp;#160;order&amp;#160;ϵy≡1−x=ϵvalue&amp;#160;of&amp;#160;order&amp;#160;ϵ
\begin{aligned}
&amp;amp;x \equiv 1 + \epsilon \text{error of order $\epsilon$} \\
&amp;amp;y \equiv 1 - x = \epsilon \text{value of order $\epsilon$} \\
\end{aligned}

That is, subtracting values close to each other (in this case, 11 and xx)
converts error order of magnitude into value order of magnitude. 
Alternatively, it brings earlier errors into promience as values.
 &amp;#167;  Analysis of subtraction
We can consider the subtraction:
x=a−b;x^=a^−b^a^=a(1+Δa)b^=b(1+Δb)∣x−x^x∣=∣−aΔa−bΔba−b∣=∣−aΔa−bΔb∣∣a−b∣=∣aΔa+bΔb∣∣a−b∣≤max⁡(∣Δa∣,∣Δb∣)(∣a∣+∣b∣)∣a−b∣
\begin{aligned}
&amp;amp;x = a - b; \hat x = \hat a - \hat b \\
&amp;amp;\hat a = a(1 + \Delta a) \\
&amp;amp;\hat b = b(1 + \Delta b) \\
&amp;amp;\left| \frac{x - \hat x}{x} \right|  \\
&amp;amp;= \left| \frac{-a\Delta a - b\Delta b}{a - b} \right| \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{|-a\Delta a - b\Delta b|}{|a - b|} \\
&amp;amp;=  \frac{|a\Delta a + b\Delta b|}{|a - b|} \\
&amp;amp;\leq  \frac{\max(|\Delta a|, |\Delta b|) (|a| + |b|)}{|a - b|}
\end{aligned}

This quantity will be large when ∣a−b∣≪∣a∣+∣b∣|a - b| \ll |a| + |b|: that is, when
there is heavy cancellation in the subtraction to compute xx. 
 &amp;#167;  Underflow
#include &amp;lt;cmath&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

int main() {
    double x = 1000;
    for(int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 60; ++i) {
        x = sqrt(x);
    }
    for(int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 60; ++i) {
        x = x*x;
    }
    printf(&amp;quot;x: %10.20f\n&amp;quot;, x);
}

This produces the output:
./sqrt-pow-1-12
...
x: 1.00000000000000000000

That is, even though the function is an identity function, the answer collapses
to 1. What is happening?
 &amp;#167;  Computing (ex−1)/x(e^x - 1)/x
One way to evaluate this function is as follows:
double f(double x) { return x == 0 ? 1 : (pow(M_E, x) - 1) / x; }

This can suffer from catastrophic cancellation in the numerator. When
xx is close to 00, exe^x is close to 1, and ex−1e^x - 1 will magnify the
error in exe^x.
double f(double x) { 
   const double y = pow(M_E, x);
   return y == 1 ? 1 : (y - 1) / log(y);
}

This algorithm seems crazy, but there&amp;#39;s insight in it. We can show that
the errors cancel! The idea is that neither (y−1)(y - 1) nor log⁡y\log y are
particularly good, the errors accumulated in them almost completely
cancel out, leaving out a good value:
assume&amp;#160;y^=11=y^≡ex(1+δ)log⁡1=log⁡(ex)+log⁡(1+δ)x=−log⁡(1+δ)x=−δ+O(δ2)
\text{assume $\hat y = 1$} \\
1 = \hat y \equiv e^x(1 + \delta) \\
\log 1 = \log (e^x ) + \log(1 + \delta) \\
x = -\log(1 + \delta) \\
x = -\delta + O(\delta^2)

If y^≠1\hat y \neq 1:
f^=(y^−1)/log⁡y^=(1+ϵ3)(y^−1)(1+ϵ+1)/(log⁡y^(1+ϵ2))
\hat f = (\hat y - 1)/\log{\hat y} = (1+\epsilon_3)(\hat y - 1)(1 + \epsilon+1)/(\log \hat y(1 + \epsilon_2))

 &amp;#167;  IEEE floating point fun: +0 and -0 for complex analysis
 Rather than think of +0 and -0 as distinct numerical values, think of their sign bit as an auxiliary variable that conveys one bit of information (or misinformation) about any numerical variable that takes on 0 as its value.
We have two types of zeroes, +0 and -0 in IEEE-754. These are used in some
cases. The most famous is that 1/+0=+∞1/+0 = +\infty, while 1/−0=−∞1/-0 = -\infty. Here,
we proceed to discuss some complex-analytic considerations.
 Therefore. implementers of compilers and run-time libraries bear a heavy burden of attention to detail if applications programmers are to realize the full benefit of the IEEE style of complex arithmetic. That benefit deserves Some discussion here if only to reassure implementers that their assiduity will be appreciated.
−1+0i=+0+i−1−0i=+0−i
\sqrt{-1 + 0 i} = +0 + i \\
\sqrt{-1 - 0 i} = +0 - i \\

These will ensure that z∗=(z)∗\sqrt{z*} = (\sqrt{z})*:
copysign(1,+0)=+1copysign(1,−0)=−1
\texttt{copysign}(1, +0) = +1 \\
\texttt{copysign}(1, -0) = -1 \\

These will ensure that copysign(x,1/x)=x\texttt{copysign}(x, 1/x) = x when x=&amp;#177;∞x = \pm \infty.
An example is provided where the two limits:
f(x+i0)=lim⁡y→0−f(x+iy)f(x+i0)=lim⁡y→0−f(x+iy)
\begin{aligned}
&amp;amp;f(x + i0) = \lim_{y \rightarrow 0-} f(x + i y) \\
&amp;amp;f(x + i0) = \lim_{y \rightarrow 0-} f(x + i y) \\
\end{aligned}

 &amp;#167;  Complex-analytic considerations
The principal branch of a complex function is a way to select one branch
of a complex-function, which tends to be multi-valued. A classical example
is the argument function, where arg⁡(reiθ=θ\arg(r e^{i \theta} = \theta. 
However, this is ambiguous: we can map θ↦θ+2π\theta \mapsto \theta + 2 \pi
and still have the same complex number. So, we need to fix some standard.
We usually pick the &amp;quot;branch&amp;quot; where 0≤θ&amp;lt;2π0 \leq \theta &amp;lt; 2 \pi.
In general, we need to carefully handle what happens to the function at
the discontinuity.
 What deserves to be undermined is blind faith in the power of Algebra. We should not believe that the equivalence class of expressions that all describe the same complex analytic function can be recognized by algebraic means alone, not even if relatively uncomplicated expressions are the only ones considered.

      <description>Making a demo in just 256 bytes would be a formidable challenge
regardless of platform. A&amp;#160;Mind&amp;#160;Is&amp;#160;Born is my attempt to do it
on the Commodore&amp;#160;64. In the absence of an actual 256-byte compo, it was
submitted to the Oldskool&amp;#160;4K&amp;#160;Intro compo at Revision&amp;#160;2017, where it ended
up on 1st place.</description>

      <description>We’re reaching the end of this series on records as strongly-typed ids. Sorry for the long delay since the last post… life happened! So far we’ve covered ASP.NET Core model binding, JSON serialization, and EF Core integration. Almost everything is working, we just need to fix a few more details.

      <description>Last time, we tried to make an awaitable shared mutex, but ran into some problems. The first problem was that shared locks can starve out exclusive locks. To fix that, we say that you cannot steal the lock if there is already anybody waiting.</description>
