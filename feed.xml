      <title>The Equinox Programming Model</title>
      <link>https://nordfjord.io/2022/12/05/equinox.html</link>
      <description>My team at birdie recently moved from a home-rolled event-sourcing library to Equinox in one of our services. Equinox describes itself as a set of low-dependency libraries allowing event-sourced processing against stream-based stores. While this description is technically accurate, a cursory look at the codebase reveals that a programming model has formed around the library over time. This article seeks to explore that programming model.</description>

      <title>Treating Devs Like Human Beings | A Conversation w/ Kelly Vaughn, Jean Hsu &amp;amp; Lena Reinhard</title>
      <link>https://devinterrupted.substack.com/p/treating-devs-like-human-beings-a</link>
      <description>Sometimes among all the sprints, the pressure to ship faster, tools to measure lines of code written, it seems like we as an industry forget a simple fact: developers are knowledge workers, not robots To remind us what it means to be a human, we invited some of the most empathetic engineering leaders we know to Interact and asked them to sit on a panel together. The conversation that followed is one of the most insightful and relevant conversations we&amp;#39;ve heard all year. Whether you are an IC, manager or manager of managers, we promise this conversation will help you become a more empathetic leader and colleague.</description>

      <description>Azure Sign Tool is similar to signtool in the Windows SDK, with the major difference being that it uses Azure Key Vault for performing the signing process.
