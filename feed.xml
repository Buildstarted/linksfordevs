      <title>Comparing Raw ASP.NET Request Throughput across Versions</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2024/Mar/08/Comparing-Raw-ASPNET-Request-Throughput-across-Versions</link>
      <description>When I set up a new machine I usually use a small ASP.NET test project to get a feel of performance of the machine and when that happens I also take a moment to compare performance across recent versions of .NET to see how things are improving - and improved they have. Both due to the new hardware I&amp;#39;m using but also ASP.NET continues to bump up performance in every new version that comes out. In this post I describe a simple project with minimal do nothing requests to test the ASP,.NET pipeline locally and how to test these request as well as discussing the results.</description>

      <title>A primer on transaction management in Entity Framework</title>
      <link>https://dateo-software.de/blog/transaction-entity-framework</link>
      <description>Whenever you are doing work within Entity Framework, there is (almost) no chance that you are doing it without transactions - whether you are aware of it or not. If you are aware of it, you&amp;#39;ll likely not need this introduction. If you are not, stay with me for this short primer on that topic.</description>

Hi Link to heading Recently, I finished a batch at the Recurse Center… is what I would have said if this post were written when I intended to write it (i.e. 3 months ago). My project there focused on a questionable application of CUDA (mostly irrelevant to this post), but it got me thinking more about other GPU-friendly algorithms.
Instead of my Recurse project (which I hope to write about in a later post), I want to simply begin writing about technical stuff I’ve played around with.</description>
