      <description>Thereâ€™s a lot to like about the Rationalist community, but they do have a certain tendency to spawnâ€‰â€”â€‰shall we sayâ€‰â€”â€‰high demand groups. We sent a card-carrying Rat to investigate whatâ€™s really going on.</description>

Keeping NuGet package versions in sync across a large .NET solution can be a nightmare.
Central Package Management fixes that â€” and in this video, Iâ€™ll show you how I migrated 40 projects in just minutes.

Youâ€™ll learn:

- What Central Package Management is and why it matters.
- How to set it up with Directory.Packages.props.
- Using the Central Package Converter CLI to migrate an existing solution.
- Tips to reduce merge conflicts and keep dependencies consistent.
- If youâ€™re tired of version drift and juggling multiple .csproj edits, this is a must-watch.

      <title>LLMs arenâ€™t world models</title>
      <link>https://yosefk.com/blog/llms-arent-world-models.html</link>
      <description>I believe that language models arenâ€™t world models. Itâ€™s a weak claim â€” Iâ€™m not saying theyâ€™re useless, or that weâ€™re done
milking them. Itâ€™s also a fuzzy-sounding claim â€” with its trillion weights, who can prove that thereâ€™s something an LLM isn't a
model of? But I hope to make my claim clear and persuasive enough with some examples.</description>
