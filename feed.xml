      <title>Practical Guide To Not Blocking The Event Loop</title>
      <link>https://www.bbss.dev/posts/eventloop/</link>
      <description>JavaScript runs in a single-threaded environment with an event loop, an architecture that is very easy to reason about. It&amp;#39;s a continuous loop executing incoming work. Synchronous work runs immediately; asynchronous work runs when there is no synchronous work to left to perform. This design implies that performing synchronous work is a Big Deal: for every continuous moment that it runs, the event loop cannot perform any work -- none!</description>

      <title>Error handling patterns</title>
      <link>https://andreabergia.com/blog/2023/05/error-handling-patterns/</link>
      <description>Error handling is a fundamental aspect of programming. Unless you are writing “hello world”, you will need to handle errors in your code. In this post, I will discuss a bit the most common approaches used by various programming languages.
Return error codes    This is one of the most ancient strategies - if a function can fail, it can simply return an error code - often a negative number, or null.</description>

      <title>The Curse of Performative User Studies</title>
      <link>https://aaronhertzmann.com/2023/04/27/user-studies.html</link>
      <description>Anyone who has spent enough time publishing some kind of artistic tools in computer graphics—even in computer vision conferences—has probably gotten reviews that praised a paper’s ideas and results, but required a user study. Or the reviewers didn’t like the paper’s methods or results, but still said the authors should add a user study. And so, maybe you added user studies to your next paper solely because you believed reviewers would require it.</description>

      <title>Ranking Anything with GPT4</title>
      <link>https://binal.pub/2023/04/ranking-anything-with-gpt4/</link>
      <description>I’ve been fascinated by this paper: Is ChatGPT Good at Search? Investigating Large Language Models as Re-Ranking Agent and have been trying out the ideas with success in a few personal projects.
They essentially found that GPT4 is excellent at ranking things. Given a set of items (candidates) and some query it can rank these items very well (as well as or better than the current SOTA models for the benchmarks they evaluated).</description>

      <link>https://indoxicate.me/the-right-to-encrypt/</link>
      <description>It can be hard to find your bearings in the discussion about online communication and end-to-end encryption. The current rhetorical focus on crime is a red herring, given that the police already has plenty of powers to track down and spy on criminals. What is really at stake is our right to privacy, and whether it is worth anything still. As I see it, it has never been more important to stand up for online privacy and argue that we have a right to encrypt. Join me on a dive into this rabbit hole...</description>

      <title>Shaping LLM Responses &amp;#183; Way Enough</title>
      <link>https://www.danielcorin.com/posts/shaping-llm-responses/</link>
      <description>It’s necessary to pay attention to the shape of a language model’s response when incorporating it as a component in a software application.
You can’t programmatically tap into the power of a language model if you can’t reliably parse its response.
In the past, I have mostly used a combination of prose and examples to define the shape of the language model response in my prompts.
Something like:</description>

      <title>I Was Laid Off In Retaliation for Anti-Discrimination Whistleblowing – Haste Makes Waste</title>
      <link>https://evhaste.com/blog/silenced-no-more</link>
      <description>In order to protect women, gender nonconforming folks, people of color, and members of the LGBTQ+ community from suffering as my peers and I have, I feel ethically obligated to go public with my experience.
In this article, I will outline why I have sufficient reason to believe that my former employer Rune Labs has violated US anti-discrimination labor laws.</description>

      <title>Radical Incrementalism</title>
      <link>https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_sustainability-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/s08-06-radical-incrementalism.html</link>
      <description>Some companies enter the market with a mission of challenging existing products with sustainable replacements. Their strategy is radical from the start. Others, typically larger established firms, gain momentum in sustainability innovation by building upon incremental improvements in products and systems. Business analysis often juxtaposes incremental change with radical or dramatic change; a common assumption is that the two are mutually exclusive. Moreover, literature in the sustainability field privileges the latter over the former, dismissing incremental change as timid at best and “greenwash” at worst—accusations that may indeed hold true at times. Separating the two concepts, incremental and radical, can be useful for heuristic purposes. Perhaps doing so is also psychologically satisfying; it’s either this or it’s that.</description>
