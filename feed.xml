      <title>Mastodon now a non-profit organisation</title>
      <link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/08/mastodon-now-a-non-profit-organisation/</link>
      <description>In June, I was able to officially register Mastodon gGmbH after nearly 8 months of legal work (“gGmbH” means “non-profit limited liability company”). A non-profit limited liability company in Germany is structered and operates similarly to a for-profit limited liability company with a few key differences. The founding document of the company is written such that the activity of the company is working towards goals that benefit the public; the shareholders may not receive any revenue from the company’s activities and can at most withdraw the funds that they originally paid in; employees may not receive extraordinarily high wages; and the company can receive donations which are then tax-free, although any other income that does not fit the definition of a donation continues to incur various taxes.</description>

      <title>Debugging External Sources with Visual Studio</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugging-external-sources-with-visual-studio/</link>
      <description>Have you ever needed to debug and step into a code of dependent NuGet or .NET libraries that do not build as part of your solution? Today, debugging through them is not so easy as debugging your projects that are part of your solution. Starting with Visual Studio 2022 Preview 3, we are adding a new &amp;quot;External Sources&amp;quot; node in the Solution Explorer which will make debugging external sources files much easier. This node appears while debugging and will show sources for managed modules with symbols loaded containing Source Link or Source Server information. You can effortlessly browse those sources files and debug through them by placing breakpoints if needed.</description>

      <title>Automate commit co-authors when pairing — Alex Blackie</title>
      <link>https://www.alexblackie.com/articles/automate-commit-coauthors-pairing/</link>
      <description>Pairing is a fantastic way to quickly bounce ideas around, get help with
	something, or even as a tool for mentoring and growth. In recent times,
	most Git-based tools have adopted the Co-Authored-By trailer
	to identify when there are multiple authors to a commit. This is great, but
	often a pain to type out manually, especially if there are many commits or
	multiple people involved.</description>
