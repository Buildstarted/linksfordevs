      <title>You Don’t Really Ever Own an EV</title>
      <link>https://www.reviewgeek.com/111381/you-dont-really-ever-own-an-ev/</link>
      <description>Buying an electric vehicle is a lot like buying a subscription to a car.&amp;#160;Almost no one can work on them except the&amp;#160;manufacturer, features get locked behind in-app purchases or software updates, and those features can get disabled at the flip of a switch.&amp;#160;If carmakers can dictate how you use your car, do you really even own it?</description>

      <title>Guess the Startup by @ttunguz
</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/tale-of-two-databases/</link>
      <description>I’m going to tell you a bit about two startups and I’d like you to guess the name of each company.
Both of these businesses are publicly traded. Both startups provide database software to developers to build applications. Both have grown very fast. In fact, their revenue trajectories through 2020 are nearly identical. Both companies employ a usage-based pricing model: pay for what you use.
In 2016, each company recorded less than $50m in revenue.</description>
