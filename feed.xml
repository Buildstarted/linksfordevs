      <title>POSIX 2024 Changes</title>
      <link>https://sortix.org/blog/posix-2024/</link>
      <description>POSIX.1-2024 has just been released with a lot of exciting and interesting
improvements and removals compared to POSIX-1.2008. The html version of the
standard has not been uploaded yet as of this writing. The official list of new
functions in the standard itself is very incomplete, so I combed through the
CHANGE HISTORY sections in the official pdf, and I present you with the most
accurate list of the changes so far.</description>

      <link>https://blogs.gnome.org/jdressler/2024/06/26/do-a-firmware-update-for-your-airpods-now/</link>
      <description>tldr: There’s a security vulnerability (CVE-2024-27867) in the firmware of Apple AirPods.
