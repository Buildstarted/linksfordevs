      <title>Pythagoras: Everyone knows his famous theorem, but not who discovered it 1000 years before him - Journal of Targeting, Measurement and Analysis for Marketing</title>
      <link>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16</link>
      <description>Everyone who has studied geometry can recall, well after the high school years, some aspect of the Pythagorean Theorem. However, the story of Pythagoras and his famous theorem is not well known. Some of the plot points of the story are presented in this article. The famous theorem goes by several names, some grounded in the behavior of the day, including the Pythagorean Theorem, Pythagoras’ Theorem and notably Euclid I 47. The Pythagorean Theorem is arguably the most famous statement in mathematics, and the fourth most beautiful equation. There are well over 371 Pythagorean Theorem proofs, originally collected and put into a book in 1927, which includes those by a 12-year-old Einstein (who uses the theorem two decades later for something about relatively), Leonardo da Vinci and President of the United States James A. Garfield. Pythagoras is immortally linked to the discovery and proof of a theorem that bears his name – even though there is no evidence of his discovering and/or proving the theorem. There is concrete evidence that the Pythagorean Theorem was discovered and proven by Babylonian mathematicians 1000 years before Pythagoras was born.</description>

      <title>.NET Rocks! Kubernetes Tooling with Annie Talvasto</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1866</link>
      <description>How do you make Kubernetes easier to use? While at the Copenhagen Developers Festival, Carl and Richard talked to Annie Talvasto about her work with Kubernetes and the Cloud Native Compute Foundation. Annie talks about the easy and hard ways to work with Kubernetes and why you might choose either approach - it comes down to how much control you want. The CNCF supports many tools for Kubernetes in various stages of development to make your life easier to orchestrate containers at scale - when you need them, you&amp;#39;ll really need them!</description>

      <title>McKinsey Developer Productivity Review</title>
      <link>https://dannorth.net/mckinsey-review/</link>
      <description>McKinsey recently published an article claiming they can measure developer productivity. This has provoked something of a backlash from some prominent software people, but I have not seen anyone engage with the content of the article itself, so I thought this would be useful.
I am writing this as though the authors have approached me for a technical review of their article. You can think of it as an open letter.</description>

      <description>Copy and paste &amp;quot;&amp;#129489;‍&amp;#127806;&amp;quot; in your terminal emulator. How many cells forward
did your cursor move? Depending on your terminal emulator, it may have moved
2, 4, 5, or 6 cells1. Yikes. This blog post describes why this happens
and how terminal emulator and program authors can achieve consistent spacing
for all characters.</description>
