      <title>Lean Scala</title>
      <link>https://odersky.github.io/blog/2024-04-11-post.html</link>
      <description>Program code is for communicating between humans, not just for instructing computers. So we strive for code to be lean. Lean code is simple and understandable. It is as concise as possible without losing clarity. It avoids lingo, over-abstraction, and obscure features. It does not mislead, that is, it expresses the meaning of a program clearly and without fault. All these properties are desirable for code just as they are desirable for technical prose.</description>

Let me give you the lens of someone who&amp;#39;s built a business, someone with strong beliefs around what does and doesn&amp;#39;t work, but otherwise has no clue what they&amp;#39;re talking about.  This is all grounded in what I&amp;#39;ve seen at Sentry over the years, so let me take you through our go-to-market journey a little bit.</description>

      <title>Stopping a badly behaved bot the wrong way. - Lemmy</title>
      <link>https://lemmy.ml/post/14612626</link>
      <description>I host a few small low-traffic websites for local interests. I do this for free
- and some of them are for a friend who died last year but didn’t want all his
work to vanish. They don’t get so many views, so I was surprised when I happened
to glance at munin and saw my bandwidth usage had gone up a lot. I spent a
couple of hours working to solve this and did everything wrong. But it was a
useful learning experience and I thought it might be worth sharing in case
anyone else encounters similar. My setup is: Cloudflare DNS -&amp;gt; Cloudflare Tunnel
(Because my residential isp uses CGNAT) -&amp;gt; Haproxy (I like Haproxy and amongst
other things, alerts me when a site is down) -&amp;gt; Separate Docker containers for
each website. On a Debian server living in my garage. From Haproxy’s stats page,
I was able to see which website was gathering attention. It’s one running PhpBB
for a little forum. Tailing apache’s logs in that container quickly identified
the pattern and made it easy to see what was happening. It was seeing a lot of
404 errors for URLs all coming from the same user-agent “claudebot”. I know what
you’re thinking - it’s an exploit scanning bot, but a closer look showed it was
trying to fetch normal forum posts, some which had been deleted months
previously, and also robots.txt. That site doesn’t have a robots.txt so that was
failing. What was weird is that the it was requesting at a rate of up to 20 urls
a second, from multiple AWS IPs - and every other request was for robots.txt.
You’d think it would take the hint after a million times of asking. Googling
that UA turns up that other PhpBB users have encountered this quite recently -
it seems to be fascinated by web forums and absolutely hammers them with the
same behaviour I found. So - clearly a broken and stupid bot, right? Rather than
being specifically malicious. I think so, but I host these sites on a rural
consumer line and it was affecting both system load and bandwidth. What I did
wrong: 1. In docker, I tried quite a few things to block the user agent, the
country (US based AWS, and this is a UK regional site), various IPs. It took me
far too long to realise why my changes to .htaccess were failing - the phpbb
docker image I use mounts the root directory to the website internally, ignoring
my mounted vol. (My own fault, it was too long since I set it up to remember
only certain sub-dirs were mounted in)
2. Figuring that out, I shelled into the container and edited that .htaccess,
but wouldn’t have survived restarting/rebuilding the container so wasn’t a real
solution. Whilst I was in there, I created a robots.txt file. Not surprisingly,
claudebot doesn’t actually honour whats in there, and still continues to request
it ten times a second. 3. Thinking there must be another way, I switched to
Haproxy. This was much easier - the documentation is very good. And it actually
worked - blocking by Useragent (and yep, I’m lucky this wasn’t changing) worked
perfectly. I then had to leave for a while and the graphs show it’s working.
(Yellow above the line is requests coming into haproxy, below the line are
responses).
[https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/2bc99426-0356-4010-a0e5-f7b8dbfeb14a.png] Great -
except I’m still seeing half of the traffic, and that’s affecting my latency.
(Some of you might doubt this, and I can tell you that you’re spoiled by an
excess of bandwidth…) 4. That’s when the penny dropped and the obvious occured.
I use cloudflare, so use their firewall, right? No excuses - I should have gone
there first. In fact, I did, but I got distracted by the many options and
focused on their bot fighting tools, which didn’t work for me. (This bot is
somehow getting through the captcha challenge even when bot fight mode is
enabled) But, their firewall has an option for user agent. The actual fix was
simply to add this in WAF for that domain.
[https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/98041b82-de04-4cdc-bfb1-05f4e5656903.png] And
voila - no more traffic through the tunnel for this very rude and stupid bot.
After 24 hours, Cloudflare has blocked almost a quarter of a million requests by
claudebot to my little phpbb forum which barely gets a single post every three
months.
[https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/f3170d6c-fec1-4820-9fbb-b54b14db46f8.png] Moral
for myself: Stand back and think for a minute before rushing in and trying to
fix something in the wrong way. I’ve also taken this as an opportunity to
improve haproxy’s rate limiting internally. Like most website hosts, most of my
traffic is outbound, and slowing things down when it gets busy really does help.
This obviously isn’t a perfect solution - all claudebot has to do is change its
UA, and by coming from AWS it’s pretty hard to block otherwise. One hopes it
isn’t truly malicious. It would be quite a lot more work to integrate Fail2ban
for more bots, but it might yet come to that. Also, if you write any kind of web
bot, please consider that not everyone who hosts a website has a lot of
bandwidth, and at least have enough pride to write software good enough to not
keep doing the same thing every second. And, y’know, keep an eye on what your
stuff is doing out on the internet - not least for your own benefit. Hopefully
AWS really shaft claudebot’s owners with some big bandwidth charges… EDIT: It
came back the next day with a new UA, and an email address linking it to
anthropic.com [http://anthropic.com] - the Claude3 AI bot, so it looks like a
particularly badly written scraper for AI learning.</description>

      <title>CS Certification - I should be exempt</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/i-should-be-exempt/</link>
      <description>Over the past few years, a number of states have acknowledged Computer Science as an academic area of study and have created pathways for certification. The actual requirements vary from state to state and indeed, even within a given state, there&amp;#39;s a lot of variation. Here in New York, for instance there are some strong programs that will truly prepare a candidate to teach CS in K12 but too many others that are just &amp;quot;certificate mills&amp;quot; and the state doesn&amp;#39;t seem to care.</description>
