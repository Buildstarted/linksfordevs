      <title>The only computer science book worth reading twice?</title>
      <link>https://simondobson.org/2010/05/14/cs-book-worth-reading-twice/</link>
      <description>I was talking to one of my students earlier, and lent him a book to
read over summer. It was only after he’d left that I realised that —
for me at any rate — the book I’d given him is probably the most
seminal work in the whole of computer science, and certainly the book
that’s most influenced my career and research&amp;#160;interests.</description>

      <title>Twitter is the worst global social network—except for all the others</title>
      <link>https://cfenollosa.com/blog/twitter-is-the-worst-global-social-network--except-for-all-the-others.html</link>
      <description>It seems &amp;#39;bashing Twitter&amp;#39; is the new countercultural trend.  I grew up in Spain in the 90s, and many people either don&amp;#39;t remember or nostalgically idealize the credibility of traditional media.  Like many 90s kids, I discovered role-playing games,</description>

      <description>The most liked comment answers 1/2, but the user got worn down by others
        until he recanted and agreed that the answer is 1/3. Many other comments
        give lengthy explanations as to why the answer is 1/3.</description>

      <description>For the last decade, I&amp;#39;ve neglected my personal relationships.

That mindset was... incredibly stupid, and it became obvious in an exchange I had</description>

      <description>We&amp;#39;ve all been there - staring at Google&amp;#39;s search box, overwhelmed by the maze of complexity hiding behind that minimalist interface, thinking it&amp;#39;s impossible to break in.

      <title>Reverse Engineering a trojan Telegram Clone</title>
      <link>https://dozheiny.net/2024/11/15/Reverse-Engineering-Trojan-Telegram-clone.html</link>
      <description>Telegram is one of the largest platforms where individuals can commit digital crimes without being noticed, unless someone reports their content.
You can easily find related material with a simple search through channels. On channels managed by Iranians, in particular, there are sometimes disturbing contents like child abuse, violence, and more.
Additionally, it can be an ideal platform for deploying trojan on a large scale.</description>

      <title>ByeBye &amp;quot;Expert&amp;quot;: Refactoring Prompts</title>
      <link>https://zhangluyao.com/blog/byebye_expert/</link>
      <description>When using AI to generate code, I keep running into the same frustrating problem: it tends to split my code excessively. A single function gets broken into multiple smaller ones, and a single file becomes a collection of scattered files. It seems to believe this approach aligns with “industry best practices.”
Take a simple task like sendMessage(user, message). Instead of keeping it straightforward, the AI splits it into a message builder, a message sender, message types, and so on—scattered across five or six files.</description>
