      <link>https://www.cryptography.fm/16</link>
      <description>Do we really need to rely on sharing every phone number on our phone in order for mobile messengers to be usable?

      <title>Soviet Venus Images</title>
      <link>http://mentallandscape.com/C_CatalogVenus.htm</link>
      <description>A digital video signal was transmitted from the lander to the orbiting main spacecraft and recorded on tape.  It consisted of 6 bits per pixel (plus a 7th parity bit) encoding a logarithmic brightness value.
Each scanline consists of 128 pixels, 11 of which are calibration and synchronization sent during the return stroke of the scanner.
This was relayed in real time and retransmitted a few times from the tape recording.
The complete video transmission seen below is reconstructed from digital data and photographic records.  After completing one panorama, the scanner reversed its motion, generating a second partial panorama, which appears upside down:</description>

      <title>Things I wish Git had: Commit groups</title>
      <link>http://blog.danieljanus.pl/2021/07/01/commit-groups/</link>

In 13 years of using it, I’ve never found myself needing a&amp;#160;feature it didn’t have. Until recently.</description>
