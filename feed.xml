      <title>I&amp;#39;m A Developer Not A Compiler</title>
      <link>https://blobstreaming.org/im-a-developer-not-a-compiler/</link>
      <description>Recently I had a phone interview where I got asked a variety of Java questions. This kind of thing is standard, and most of the questions were somewhat standard:

 * What is polymorphism?
 * What’s the difference between a List and a Set? When would you use one over the other?</description>

      <description>One of the common misconceptions of Windows applications are that they are inherently insecure and that it’s not possible to build and deploy applications that are secure by default. If you look at other platforms, such as iOS and Android, applications have restricted permissions and have to opt in (often requiring explicit user consent) to ... Read more</description>

      <link>https://awaisrauf.github.io/deepCuriosity/Attending-NeurIPS2023</link>
      <description>NeurIPS is the top conference for artificial intelligence (AI) research [2]. It offers an excellent opportunity to present your work to fellow researchers, gain a sense of the latest developments in AI, and connect with the people driving the field. Despite having my paper accepted, I couldn’t attend the last two sessions due to COVID and visa issues. However, I managed to participate in this year’s conference in New Orleans, United States. It was an incredible week filled with all things AI. In the following, I will document the talks I attended, the papers I liked, the people I met, and the things I learned.</description>

      <title>Programming in just ONE language should be lauded. – Cliffski&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://www.positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2023/11/02/programming-in-just-one-language-should-be-lauded/</link>
      <description>I recently read about the news that garbage collection support, which was added to C++, is now actually being removed from it. Apparently most people didn’t use it, or even knew it was officially added, so it is no great loss. It always shocks me to read articles about C++ with a version number, because as far as I am concerned, C++ has no version number and never will, in the same way that a language such as English has no ‘version number’. I’m 54 and its pretty rare that I add a new word to my English vocabulary, and its even rarer for me to learn something new about C++ that I start to use in my code.</description>

              This website has gone through countless rewrites – from
              WordPress to Jekyll to multiple static site
              generators of my own – but this is the final one. I know
              so, because I&amp;#39;ve found the ultimate method for writing

      <title>Content Moderation APIs are Really, Really Bad</title>
      <link>https://blog.haizelabs.com/posts/content-moderation-apis-are-bad/</link>
      <description>With an ever-growing collection of text content on the web, and ever-growing LLM-powered systems that automatically interact with such data, scalable content moderation emerges as a significant challenge.
One seemingly reasonable solution is from OpenAI. Since a tenet of their mission is to ensure AI benefits all of humanity, careful development and deployment of their models is top of mind.
As part of this effort, OpenAI offers the free Moderation API.</description>

      <link>https://gagor.pl/2023/04/the-best-way-to-get-nvm-working-in-ci/cd-systems/</link>
      <description>TL;DR While reasoning is important, readers may not be interested in all the frustrations I experienced while figuring out how to get things done. If you’re looking for a quick solution, skip to the “What eventually worked?” section. However, if you’re interested in the thought process behind the solution, keep reading.

      <title>What I learned selling my company</title>
      <link>https://www.harryglaser.com/what-i-learned-selling-my-company/</link>
      <description>At my first company, I internalized the standard advice to never think about M&amp;amp;A. The consensus was, and is, to just keep growing the business and good things will come. I did that, and I was lucky that good things did come in the form of a $130M acquisition</description>

      <title>What are you producing?</title>
      <link>https://destructive-thoughts.com/2024/01/12/what-are-you-producing.html</link>
      <description>People are obsessed with productivity. There are apps that claim to
boost your productivity, courses, blog posts, entire books. A question
that is rarely asked is: what are you producing? Are you creating
worthless proofs of concept for a startup that siphons off money from
rich people or the state? Don’t worry about productivity, you’re doing
just fine. Do you help pushing out tank-like vehicles that pollute the
environment and turn our cities into dystopian hellscapes? By all means,
consider being less productive. Are you developing surveillance tools
for a corporation that thrives on ad money? I implore you, be as
unproductive as you can.</description>
