      <title>Common mistakes by indie game developers – Cliffski&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://www.positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2021/10/14/common-mistakes-by-indie-game-developers/</link>
      <description>Background: I’ve been a one-man indie studio for over 20 years, sold millions of games on steam, direct, and on mac and even some console stuff. I’ve arguably had 4 ‘hit games’ over that period (seven figure revenue). This is all just my opinion, but its based on long experience. I’ve been programming for 40 years.</description>

      <title>How I Helped ‘hack’ the 2016 Election via Information Warfare – @rej_ex</title>
      <link>https://robertwillishacking.com/the-machine-enabled-by-facebook-how-i-helped-hack-the-2016-election-via-information-warfare/</link>
      <description>Before QAnon, before COVID, fake news as we know it was born during the 2016 election. The following is my story, a whistleblowers account on how I was able to manipulate a reach of tens of millions of targeted Americans weekly during the 2016 election cycle after building/overseeing a fully funded one-of-a-kind syndication machine consisting of a couple hundred targeted websites. Some people will be disappointed that there was no connection to Trump’s campaign. He did benefit greatly from it though.</description>

      <title>How opcache works</title>
      <link>https://www.npopov.com/2021/10/13/How-opcache-works.html</link>
      <description>The opcache PHP extension implements various functionality to speed up PHP in a transparent manner. As the name indicates, its origin and primary purpose is opcode caching, but nowadays it also contains an optimizer and just-in-time compiler. However, this blog post will focus only on the opcode caching aspect.</description>

      <description>I’m currently enjoying being unemployed, and I won’t be looking for a new position until some time in 2022, but I’ve been thinking about what I want from next position. There are many things I’d like, but what are my priorities?
This post is my attempt to organize my own thoughts about this so I can be more careful and systematic when I start looking for my next position.

      <title>A viable solution for Python concurrency</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/872869/0e62bba2db51ec7a/</link>
      <description>Concerns over the performance of programs written in Python are often
overstated — for some use cases, at least.  But there is no getting around
the problem imposed by the infamous global interpreter lock (GIL), which
severely limits the concurrency of multi-threaded Python code.  Various
efforts to remove the GIL have been made
over the years, but none have come anywhere near the point where they would
be considered for inclusion into the CPython interpreter.  Now, though, Sam
Gross has entered
the arena with a proof-of-concept implementation that may solve the
problem for real.</description>
