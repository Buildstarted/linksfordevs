      <description>The binary array set[0] is a very space-efficient data structure that supports adding elements and testing membership reasonably quickly. It basically works as a collection of sorted arrays with power-of-2 sizes.</description>

      <title>Neatnik Notes &amp;#183; A Fediverse, if you can keep it</title>
      <link>https://notes.neatnik.net/2024/03/a-fediverse-if-you-can-keep-it</link>
      <description>Before information about Meta’s “Project 92” (which would later become Threads) first surfaced last year, most of the discussion around blocking entire instances on the Fediverse was centered around the nature of member behavior on any given instance. If an instance was overrun with people posting abhorrent content, or was poorly moderated and allowed a number of their members to cause problems for other instances, there’s a good chance that the instance would be cut off.</description>

      <title>You&amp;#39;re Not a CEO</title>
      <link>https://cra.mr/youre-not-a-ceo/</link>
      <description>In 2019 I stepped down as CEO at Sentry. I remember when talking to our CFO about considering the transition his response (whether considered or not) was that he thought I was capable of doing the job. I hired a CEO not because I didn&amp;#39;t think I could do the job, but because I didn&amp;#39;t think I was the best person for the job. You might not be either, and there&amp;#39;s a good chance that even if you&amp;#39;re calling yourself a CEO, you&amp;#39;re not operating like one.</description>

      <title>On using screens intentionally – Writings and rehearsals by Nathan Schneider</title>
      <link>https://nathanschneider.info/2024/03/clearing-my-desk-on-using-screens-intentionally/</link>
      <description>What follows are some notes about how I use screens, which I am bothering to write because I increasingly notice how my habits diverge from those of people around me. I have not bothered to validate the effectiveness of these practices in any statistical or otherwise scientific way. But people do frequently ask about my productivity habits, and, with an n of 1, these notes are part of the answer. Perhaps they will be helpful for you.</description>

      <description>Feature flags are amazing. No, really, did I tell you that feature flags are amazing? They are. But you might be running a thousand applications. When this kind of complexity gets involved you might need to test combinations of feature flags, sometimes - dozens of those combinations. Exhaustive testing to the rescue!</description>

      <title>`async: false` is the worst. Here&amp;#39;s how to never need it again.</title>
      <link>https://saltycrackers.dev/posts/bye-bye-async-false/</link>
      <description>A common challenge when testing Elixir apps is dealing with shared/global state. When multiple tests modify/access the same piece of state, in order to ensure the tests don’t interfere with each other, we need to serialize the tests using async: false.
To isolate tests from each other and avoid async: false, here we explore a technique for “localizing” global state. That is, we reduce the scope of in-memory state such that each ExUnit test has its own private copy of the state. With global state thus localized, our ExUnit tests are decoupled and safe for async: true.</description>
