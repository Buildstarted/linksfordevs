      <description>Let&amp;#39;s Encrypt is an amazing organisation doing an amazing thing by providing certificates at scale, for free. The problem though was that they were the only such organisation for a long time, but I&amp;#39;m glad to say that the ecosystem is changing.    It&amp;#39;s always a good idea to have another</description>

In many of those decisions, the options have order to them. A joke can be more or less dirty. We can over or under mix batter.</description>

      <description>A customer was looking for a thread-safe collection type, and they found the Windows Runtime PropertySet object. Is this thing thread-safe? Yes, the PropertySet object is thread-safe. However, it still may not be what you want. The PropertySet object is thread-safe in the sense that all of its operations are atomic.</description>

      <title>Batteries included with Emacs</title>
      <link>https://karthinks.com/software/batteries-included-with-emacs/</link>
      <description>Emacs has a reputation for being borderline unusable out of the box, of being bloated but somehow surprisingly bare.
This is largely a discoverability problem1. The solution the Internet has settled on seems to be “Emacs distributions” like Doom, Spacemacs or Prelude that glue together dozens (sometimes hundreds) of addons to deliver a batteries included, finely tuned and user-friendly experience from first launch. While it’s not for me, this does work great&amp;#160;2, and many of these packages will probably make their way into the default Emacs experience in due time.</description>

      <title>Eight years at Roblox</title>
      <link>https://zeux.io/2020/08/02/eight-years-at-roblox/</link>
      <description>I joined Roblox at the end of 2012 as a rendering engineer; I had just spent more than a year working on various titles from FIFA franchise after years of console game development and was becoming a bit tired of the “big game development”. My work on FIFA was as a contractor and I got an offer for a full-time position, but I also had a friend who worked at Roblox reach out and offer me to move to California and work on Roblox. I knew absolutely nothing about Roblox, but California was nice and my friend told me it would be awesome. The platform was so different (and so strange!) that I decided to take a chance - here I am, 8 years later, still working at Roblox and enjoying it. I started on my first full time job in April 2007 so at this point I’ve worked for 13 years in game development and 8 of them were at Roblox.</description>

      <title>Windows Subsystem for Linux: The lost potential - jmmv.dev</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/wsl-lost-potential.html</link>
      <description>If you have followed Windows 10 at all during the last few years, you know that the Windows Subsystem for Linux, or WSL for short, is the hot topic among developers. You can finally run your Linux tooling on Windows as a first class citizen, which means you no longer have to learn PowerShell or, god forbid, suffer through the ancient CMD.EXE console.
Unfortunately, not everything is as rosy as it sounds.</description>

      <title>Announcing TypeScript 4.1 | TypeScript</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/</link>
      <description>Today we’re proud to release TypeScript 4.1! If you’re unfamiliar with TypeScript, it’s a language that builds on JavaScript by adding syntax for type declarations and annotations. This syntax can be used by the TypeScript compiler to type-check our code, and then output clean readable JavaScript that runs on lots of different runtimes.</description>

      <title>Understanding Disposables In .NET Dependency Injection - Part 1 - Steve Talks Code</title>
      <link>https://stevetalkscode.co.uk/disposables-in-di-part-1</link>
      <description>In this post I will be discussing the traps that can catch you out by potentially creating memory leaks when registering types that implement the IDisposable interface as services with the out-of-the-box .NET Dependency Injection container.</description>

      <title>Understanding Disposables In .NET Dependency Injection - Part 3 - Steve Talks Code</title>
      <link>https://stevetalkscode.co.uk/disposables-in-di-part-3</link>
      <description>Following on from Parts 1 and 2, in this final part of the series, I move on to dealing with types that you do not have source control for and therefore cannot change directly to hide the Dispose method using the techniques I have described in the previous posts.</description>
