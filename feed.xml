      <title>Plan 9 Desktop Guide</title>
      <link>https://pspodcasting.net/dan/blog/2019/plan9_desktop.html#intro</link>
      <description>Briefly,
            Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a computer operating system designed by the original UNIX design team,
            after decades of work on Research UNIX in the late 80&amp;#39;s,
            the team decided to write a new operating system from scratch,
            Plan 9 was finally released in 1992,
            and a few years later they released yet another operating system called
            Inferno,
            which share many of the same characteristics as its sister project.
            These systems,
            and variations thereof,
            have more or less been in continual development since.
            The history and design philosophy behind these operating systems,
            is interesting,
            but we will not talk about that here.
            Instead,
            this article will focus on the practical aspects of using Plan 9 as day-to-day desktop system.</description>

      <title>Open Source Tax Software | Connor Skennerton</title>
      <link>http://ctskennerton.github.io/2021/08/30/open-source-tax-software/</link>
      <description>Filing taxes in America sucks. Your options are to do it by hand, pay someone like Intuit, or if you are below a certain income threshold get some tax software for free. The kicker is that free tax software is from Intuit who will try very hard to make sure that you either don’t find it in the first place, or try to get you to pay for it and upsell you on something that should be free.</description>
