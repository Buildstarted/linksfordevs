      <description>If you’ve read my first post about assembly language, you might expect that this is another post on how to understand assembly language. I will write more about that at some point, but this post is not that. Instead, this post is going to talk about some of the weird things and random trivia I learned while writing an x86 and amd64 emulator. The emulator I wrote was for Time Travel Debugging.</description>

      <link>https://tomlee.wtf/2023/02/03/fake-tags-are-a-real-problem/</link>
      <description>As a bicyclist I am always ready to believe the worst about drivers. Drivers are why I’m woken up by gunning engines in the middle of the night. Drivers are why I have titanium screwed into my collarbone. Drivers! That I bring my children to school by bicycle every weekday morning has only raised the stakes and, along with it, my ire.</description>

      <title>Names can be so much more</title>
      <link>https://kodare.net/2023/02/02/names-can-be-so-much-more.html</link>
      <description>We programmers say names (of variables, functions, classes, etc.) are extremely important. The debate over how much code should be self-documenting is largely a debate about how good names can be. I think this all misses a bigger problem: names are for humans only, but they don’t have to be.</description>

      <title>Stuff I Don&amp;#39;t Like About Netflix</title>
      <link>https://ghvsted.com/blog/stuff-i-dont-like-about-netflix/</link>
      <description>Over the past few months, I have noticed my usage of Netflix has increased. I typically watch Netflix on my Macbook using a Safari browser. While I love that Netflix exists to fill those 10, 15-minute breaks when I am having lunch, there’s just some stuff I do not quite like about using Netflix. I list some of them below:
 Content I have seen before still gets recommended to me Movies and shows I have previously seen still show up on “My List” —&amp;#160;It would be nice to have them move to a separate category.</description>

      <link>https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/postgresql/postgresql-constraints-learning-postgresql-with-grant/</link>
      <description>One of the most important aspects of data management is the ability to ensure that the data in your database is well defined and consistent. Some aspects of that are ensured through the relational data structures you design. Another piece of control is using the correct data type. Then, we get to constraints. A constraint is a way to validate data prior to adding it to your database. This is one more tool in the toolbox that helps you maintain good data.</description>
