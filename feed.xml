      <title>Answering &amp;quot;Why did the KPI change?&amp;quot; using decomposition</title>
      <link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/kpi-evolution-decomposition/</link>
      <description>Motivation Say you’re a data analyst at a company. You’ve built a dashboard with several KPIs. You’re happy because it took you a couple of days of hard work. You even went the extra mile of writing unit tests. You share the dashboard on Slack with the relevant stakeholders, call it a day, and go grab a beer.
A couple of weeks later, a stakeholder pings you on Slack, asking why some KPI changed.</description>

      <title>Reminder of Negative Work</title>
      <link>https://theochri.gitlab.io/my-personal-website/posts/reminder-of-negative-work/</link>
      <description>The idea of being hyper-productive every day might seem like a good thing, but it can actually lead to “negative work”.
Negative work is when you think you are doing great work, but actually, it’s setting you back because you lack the clarity of mind to realize that the work you are doing will not get you closer to your goals.
Often in the past, I would think, let us go for another hour just to squeeze out a bit more.</description>

      <title>Using nix-shell to create and share reproducible embedded development environments</title>
      <link>https://dnedic.github.io/blog/nix-shell-embedded-development-environment/</link>
      <description>Historically, working on embedded software meant using proprietary manufacturer-provided IDEs with tools like the toolchain, build system and debugger all integrated.
As open source tooling eventually caught up and even surpassed closed source solutions in many regards we often no longer have to rely on closed solutions and can adopt traditional software development tools and practices.</description>

      <title>Premature Optimization: Universally Misunderstood</title>
      <link>https://milen.me/writings/premature-optimization-universally-misunderstood/</link>
      <description>“Premature Optimization” You might have come across the famous software optimisation quote popularised by Donald Knuth:
Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
– Sir Tony Hoare
It has been commonly interpreted as “don’t think about performance in the beginning, you can fix any performance problem later”. This interpretation is completely and categorically wrong.
Original Quote It’s very common for statements to lose their original meaning when context has been stripped and that’s exactly what happened here.</description>

      <title>The Tale of a Corrupt Backup</title>
      <link>https://blog.cskr.dev/posts/corrupt-backup/</link>
      <description>As I mentioned in the post about my backup system, I run restic check
regularly, to test the integrity of my backup. It has never reported any error
in my repository. It performs a quick, shallow check, and does not verify that
all the data is intact. I also restore a random file, whenever I run restic check, to test recoverability.
Shortly after I wrote the previous post, I decided to run restic check --read-data for the first time ever. This reads every file in the repository
and simulates a full restore. To my utter horror, it reported many errors like
these!
Pack ID does not match, want 5e66c2ac, got e80051de
pack d64be86d contains 1 errors: [Blob ID does not match, want 8ebf2c10, got 350f6ba1]</description>
