      <description>One of the most time-consuming parts of application development is debugging. This already hard part of our day to day life can easily become a nightmare if the application crashes only on production and you cannot reproduce it on your local machine. Fortunately, we have .NET tools which can come really handy in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Why Massachusetts Struggled to Make a Vaccine Website</title>
      <link>https://www.zagaja.com/2021/02/vaccine-websites/</link>
      <description>In 1872, a fire broke out in the basement of a warehouse on Summer Street in Boston. As flames spread to nearby buildings, Boston firefighters called for backup. Neighboring towns responded, only to discover that their hoses would not fit into the hydrants. The couplings that connect the hydrants to the hoses had not been standardized. This hampered the help the firefighters could give, and thirty people died. 776 buildings burned. Fast forward to 2021. Companies and governments are trying to share information about vaccine appointments. Their systems cannot connect with each other. People cannot get shots. The death toll is ongoing. History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.</description>

      <title>ISO 8601: the better date format | Blog</title>
      <link>https://kirby.kevinson.org/blog/iso-8601-the-better-date-format/</link>
      <description>If you haven’t been living under a rock, you’ve probably heard that
there are different date formats in the world such as the American one
(mm/dd/yyyy) and the European one (dd.mm.yyyy). If you’re smart
enough, you’ve probably also noticed that the American one makes no
sense and is just awful. A simple conclusion that many people draw out
of this is that the European format is the best one, however I don’t
think this is true. If you’re one of these people who think so, I’m
here to (hopefully) change your mind by introducing you to a
lesser-known date format called ISO 8601.</description>

      <description>A customer reported that they program was crashing because it got the error E_ILLEGAL_DELEGATE_ASSIGNMENT.
