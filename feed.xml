      <title>How to process large file?</title>
      <link>https://nanxiao.me/en/how-to-process-large-file/</link>
      <description>In&amp;#160;Process large data in external memory, I mentioned: Update: Split large file into smaller ones, and use multiple threads to handle them is a good idea. I want to elaborate how to process large file here: (1) Split the large file into small ones which are independent from each other. E.g., based on users. Then you can spawn multiple threads to process each small file. (2) For the output: if all threads output to same file, the write operations must be atomic and it will become bottleneck of the program. So every thread should have its own output file. (3) After all threads exit, main thread can use&amp;#160;cat&amp;#160;or other methods to consolidate all output files into one.</description>

      <description>Giving talks has been one of the pillars of my career. I’ve given keynotes at software events all over the world. Some of these talks have tens, even hundreds, of thousands of views on youtube. I keep being asked back, so I assume I do a pretty decent job. But those who don’t know me well are often surprised when they learn the most important thing about my speaking profession.</description>

      <description>It might not seem there&amp;#39;s much to learn about how to work hard.
Anyone who&amp;#39;s been to school knows what it entails, even if they
chose not to. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And
yet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I
was in school, the answer is definitely yes.</description>
