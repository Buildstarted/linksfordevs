      <description>I used to like vscode. I&amp;#39;ve been using it since it could run and debug C#. Last year, I noticed I frequently hit bugs where I couldn&amp;#39;t type until I switched out and back into the editor with alt-tab. That&amp;#39;s not so bad but it got annoying when I couldn&amp;#39;t build or debug until I restarted the program</description>

      <description>In the last post, I talked about the hunt for liquidity in VC and the role that transparency has in building a healthy secondary market.

      <title>The Real C++ Killers (Not You, Rust)</title>
      <link>https://wordsandbuttons.online/the_real_cpp_killers.html</link>
      <description>All the “C++ killers”, even these which I wholeheartedly love and respect like Rust, Julia, and D, help you write more features with fewer bugs, but they don&amp;#39;t much help when you need to squeeze the very last FLOPS from the hardware you rent. As such, they don’t have a competitive advantage over C++. Or, for that matter, even over each other. Most of them, for instance, Rust, Julia, and Clang even share the same backend. You can’t win a car race if you all share the same car. So, which technologies do hold a competitive advantage over C++ or, speaking generally, all the traditional ahead-of-time compilers?</description>

      <title>DO NOT BUY HISENSE TV&amp;#39;S LOL (Or at least keep them offline)</title>
      <link>https://cohost.org/ghoulnoise/post/5286766-do-not-buy-hisense-t</link>
      <description>holy fucking shit!!!!!!!!!!

I&amp;#39;ve had this in my drafts to finish writing up for a few weeks but today I made another discovery that has pushed me to finally write it up lol.

My PC had a few hiccups over the past couple of years. Nothing so serious that I was truly concerned (at first) but, annoyances, to be sure. (&amp;quot;PC? Weren&amp;#39;t you talking about a TV??&amp;quot; you might be thinking to yourself. Yes. I&amp;#39;ll get there. Oh, will I ever get there.)

For a long time, the most serious hiccup with my PC was being unable to open Display Settings on my PC. I had to use Nvidia control panel to make adjustments. Whatever. Didn&amp;#39;t affect my ability to work or anything. I had just updated to Windows 11 so I thought maybe something went wrong in the update. So I did another install (which meant I had to re-install a ton of music plugin stuff on my computer which takes ages given all the stuff I use.)

The fresh install still didn&amp;#39;t fix it. So I simply ignored it for the better part of 2 years.

Over time, so slowly I didn&amp;#39;t really clock them as being related, other things started to fail.

I have a Komplete Kontrol S88 midi Keyboard that interfaces with Kontakt and Komplete Kontrol in my DAW. I can use the keyboard to adjust settings or select instruments without having to look at my computer screen. At some point last year this stopped working. I could still use it to input midi, and I was afraid I&amp;#39;d have to do a fresh install of all the Native Instruments stuff I use, so I kept putting off trying to fix it until I had less going on with work. It worked, just not as well as it should!

Then, Task manager started to hang in weird ways. It wouldn&amp;#39;t close unless I forced it closed with ProcExp. Whatever! Computers are weird!

I had trouble getting video capture cards to connect when I considered streaming Splatoon. Whatever! I&amp;#39;m not a streamer, I should probably use that energy on something else.

But then, in March, I had some things fail that, turns out, are pretty necessary to using the computer.

I was trying to get remote desktop to work on my tablet so I could work in the living room closer to my cat, Grendel, who was still very much in mourning for his best friend (&amp;lt;3 Guts). Grendel is at his happiest when he&amp;#39;s napping on the couch next to a human. So I thought, hey, I could do some stuff in remote desktop mode! It wasn&amp;#39;t something I used very often because it doesn&amp;#39;t play super nice with audio, it&amp;#39;d been probably over a year since I last used it, but I knew it had worked and had been easy to set up.

Well. It refused to connect despite appearing as an option on my tablet. And as I was trying to troubleshoot this problem...

My task bars on my PC disappeared! If I moused over the spot they should have been I got the loading circle. And my monitors would jitter!

System settings were nowhere to be found. To navigate I had to open Task Manager (which if you recall was already acting strange and sluggish for the past year) in order to open the command panel, which I&amp;#39;d then use to launch programs. Or, attempt to. If I tried to open the system settings, my PC spat out &amp;quot;Uhhh what&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Settings&amp;quot;? We ain&amp;#39;t got settings&amp;quot; (in command I got &amp;quot;C:\Windows\System32&amp;gt;start ms-settings: Access is denied.&amp;quot; despite being in admin mode)

SO I started to panic a wee bit. It&amp;#39;s not a great time for me to possibly need a new PC! Plus, it works great when it works.

I manually backed up everything important from my main PC drive (as I could not access the windows backup program because it lived in settings!!!!!!!!) and downloaded the Windows 11 installer to a drive in case I needed to completely wipe my computer and start fresh.

In a last ditch effort, I tried updating my Nvidia GeForce graphics driver and restarted.

Lo and behold, my taskbars came back and I could access settings again! Huzzah!

This lasted for 6 days. And then the taskbars disappeared AGAIN along with Settings.

At least by now I&amp;#39;d become somewhat comfortable using command to get around, so I was less panicked than I was in round 1. I at least knew the computer wouldn&amp;#39;t crash and delete all my shit suddenly (plus I had my backups that were up-to-date).

I asked my friends if they&amp;#39;d ever heard of anything like this, and Cohost&amp;#39;s own @vogon helped me poke around some additional graphics driver stuff in case updating to the new Nvidia program that&amp;#39;s in beta would solve my issue. This felt super promising when I went into safe mode and saw taskbars. So, I did the update, and, as before, when I updated, the taskbars came back! But there were gone again almost immediately. My screen literally started flickering and they vanished. It was so fucking bizarre.

I turned to google once more, hoping that somehow, as useless as google is these days, maybe I&amp;#39;d find what I needed to fix my damn computer!

Somehow, against all odds, I found it. I happened to use the exact right string in my search to pull up some reddit threads. The first one didn&amp;#39;t have anything useful, but a few results down I spotted &amp;quot;no taskbar and task manager freezes&amp;quot; holy moly!!!

At first glance however, there wasn&amp;#39;t anything useful. But then I spotted some collapsed comments at the bottom of the thread. I knew more than likely they just had comments like &amp;quot;sucks bro&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;this is why i use linux :/&amp;quot; But I expanded them and inside was a link to a Microsoft forum post. I kept my expectations in check and clicked on the link. What I saw had my nearly vibrating in my seat.

Screenshots showing the path from my google search to reddit to a minimized comment that contained a link to a microsoft forum post with the solution to my several year long problem - caused by our TV [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/d9f5719e-fe05-4247-9c27-39c3381f0648/screenshot%20collage.png?width=675&amp;amp;#x26;auto=webp&amp;amp;#x26;dpr=1]

This was the solution. [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1339707/help-with-figuring-out-what-is-causing-waitchain-d]

So I finally solved it!

Source of the problem: an Android TV (HiSense model) connected to my network. Yes. A TV caused this issue.

HISENSE? LIKE THE SAME BRAND OF TV I HAVE HAD SINCE 2020???

I followed the instructions. I deleted keys generated by our TV for 5 straight minutes. 5 Minutes of like 200BPM clicking. I restarted. Everything worked again. I laughed so hard I cried. I felt like I&amp;#39;d solved a murder. The main suspect was the PC but the culprit was the TV in the other room. And he almost got away with it!!! If I had spent a few days carrying out a clean install and re-installing all my work stuff, my problem would have come back. If I had taken the PC out back and shot it and replaced it with a fancy new computer, the problem would have come back.

Because the problem was never the PC. The Problem was my Hisense TV in the next room.

Once I carried this out, I was able to open display settings for the first time (outside of safe mode) in 2 years. When I deleted the keys, my Task Manager started behaving normally again. I turned around and saw that my keyboard was once again displaying the VST controls on its screen. The fancy midi keyboard was back at full functionality. I was able to connect my CRT as a display again using the HDMI -&amp;gt; RCA converters I&amp;#39;d assumed had stopped working (nope! they still worked, they always worked!)

Which brings me to today. Almost a month later everything still works. So, I decided to see if remote desktop would magically work again. The answer is: Yes. Yes, in fact, my TV was the reason my remote desktop connection had failed the month before.

So here I am, sitting on my couch with my tablet and bluetooth keeb and mouse, writing this post in remote desktop mode so I could attach screenshots of this saga to my post without sitting at my PC. Grendel is snoring beside me as I write.

As a treat for reading this far, please enjoy two screenshots of my friends reacting to the solution of my great mystery.
