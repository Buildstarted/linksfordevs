      <description>Anyway, a few people from SVLUG, including
Don Marti, Rick Moen (yes he was 
there), Chris DiBona,
the world famous Nick Moffitt, and Tabinda Khan, organized the Bay Area windows
refund effort.
Since at the Linux tea party, microsoft showed up at
our meeting point to try to deter us from going to their offices in Palo Alto,
this time, the ultimate meeting point was kept secret, and 4 officers revealed
it at the last minute to the crowd that had gathered, as planned, at the four
meeting points around the Bay Area.</description>

Let&amp;#39;s give Apple the benefits of the doubt and not get too deep into how they got that number, and put it to perspective and compare the iPhone with the Top 500 Supercomputers in the world over the years:</description>

      <title>The Database Inside Your Codebase</title>
      <link>https://feifan.blog/posts/the-database-inside-your-codebase</link>
      <description>Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer&amp;#39;s time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers&amp;#39; heads. It&amp;#39;s difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack &amp;quot;code browsers&amp;quot; that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we&amp;#39;ll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes.</description>

      <title>I Really Blew It | Interactive Storytelling Tools for Writers</title>
      <link>http://www.erasmatazz.com/personal/self/i-really-blew-it.html</link>
      <description>I recently realized that I have been wasting my time on a dumb effort for the last 35 years. It all started back in 1983. My game for the Atari, Eastern Front (1941), had been a big hit, and Dale Yocum of the Atari Program Exchange suggested that I release the source code for it. This was an exciting idea, as nobody had ever release source code for a commercial game before then, and I readily agreed. However, I insisted that the source code be thoroughly explained, so I spent some months writing up a long explanation of all the algorithms used in the game. The entire package came to some 150 pages. We charged a lot of money for it, so it didn’t sell many copies. Still, I hoped that the buyers would use the ideas in the package. I was disappointed, because only one game appeared using any of the ideas we published in the source code: Ghost Ship, by Kellyn Beeck. Perhaps somebody else used some of the ideas without my knowing, but I rather doubt it.</description>

      <title>OTCC : Obfuscated Tiny C Compiler</title>
      <link>https://bellard.org/otcc/</link>
      <description>My goal was to write the smallest C compiler which is able to compile
itself. I choose a subset of C which was general enough to write a
small C compiler. Then I extended the C subset until I reached the
maximum size authorized by the contest: 2048 bytes of C source
excluding the &amp;#39;;&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;{&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;}&amp;#39; and space characters.</description>

      <description>In January 2007 I was introduced to some interesting photos 
      of ice growing from a metal fence on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, 
      Canada.&amp;#160; I corresponded with Sheryl Terris about her photos and she 
      gave me permission to use them on my web page.&amp;#160; In these three photos 
      we see ribbons of ice emerging from where the top beam sits on the 
      vertical support posts.</description>

      <description>Last time, we looked at using a COM weak reference to access our singleton quickly. so you can access them all at once. That improves the efficiency of accessing objects in the COM static store, but you can do even better.</description>

      <link>https://www.oxinabox.net/2021/02/13/Julia-1.6-what-has-changed-since-1.0.html</link>
      <description>Julia 1.0 came out well over 2 years ago.
Since then a lot has changed and a lot hasn’t.
Julia 1.0 was a commitment to no breaking changes, 
but that is not to say no new features have been added to the language.</description>
