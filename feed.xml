      <title>Set Replication - fault tolerance without total ordering</title>
      <link>https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-12-27-set-replication/</link>
      <description>While state machine replication is the gold standard for implementing any (public) ideal functionality, its power comes at the cost of needing to totally order all transactions and as a consequence solve (Byzantine) agreement. In some cases this overhead is unnecessary. In the non-byzantine setting, the fundamental observation that sometimes...</description>

      <title>Introduction to Code Golf and Golflangs</title>
      <link>https://blog.vero.site/post/golf</link>
      <description>Code golf is the recreational activity1 of trying to write programs that are as short as possible.2 Golfed programs still have to be correct, but brevity is prioritized above every other concern — e.g., robustness, performance, or legibility — which usually leads to really interesting code.
I think code golf is a lot of fun (although I think a lot of things are fun, so it’s one of those hobbies that I get really into roughly one month every year and then completely forget about for the remaining eleven). I wanted to write an introduction because I don’t know of any good general introductions to code golf, particularly ones that try to be language-agnostic and that cover the fascinating world of programming languages designed specifically for code golf, which I’ll call golflangs for short. But more on that later.
Note: If you are the kind of person who prefers to just dive in and try golfing some code without guidance, you should skip to the code golf sites section.
A simple example Of course, there’s a reason most code golf tutorials focus on a single language: most code golf techniques are language-specific. The Code Golf &amp;amp;amp; Coding Challenges (CGCC) StackExchange community has a list of some golfing tips that apply to most languages, but there are far more tricks in just about any language-specific list, and most of the intrigue lies in knowing the language you’re golfing well. So to provide a taste of the code golf experience, let’s golf a simple problem, Anarchy Golf’s Factorial, in Python.
In this problem, we have to read a series of positive integers from standard input, one per line, and output the factorial of each, also one per line. Here’s a stab at a simple, direct implementation with no golfing at all:3
def factorial(n): if n &amp;amp;lt;= 1: return 1 return n * factorial(n-1) try: while True: print(factorial(int(input()))) except EOFError: pass</description>

      <title>Deploy != Release</title>
      <link>https://andydote.co.uk/2022/11/02/deploy-doesnt-mean-release/</link>
      <description>Recently we were having a debate about release processes, and I wrote that deployments are not always equal to releases.
also deploy != release
—Andy, baiting discussion in Slack This turned out to be somewhat controversial until we discussed what I specifically meant by deploy and release.
As with all things, agreeing on definitions or understanding what someone means when they use a specific term is essential, so I thought I would write down a short blog post on it.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Hanukkah of Data 2022</title>
      <link>https://www.georgeho.org/hanukkah-of-data-2022/</link>
      <description>This blog post contains spoilers for Hanukkah of Data 2022.
This holiday season I’ve been doing the Hanukkah of Data, which is a puzzle suite by a group of hackers called the Devottys. It’s a sequence of programming puzzles, with one puzzle dropping for every day of Hanukkah. If you’re familiar with Advent of Code, it’s very similar to that, except (a) it only lasts 8 days instead of 25, and (b) it’s more data-oriented, instead of coding or algorithms-oriented.</description>
