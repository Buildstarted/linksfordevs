      <title>Jujutsu For Busy Devs | maddie, wtf?!</title>
      <link>https://maddie.wtf/posts/2025-07-21-jujutsu-for-busy-devs</link>
      <description>Jujutsu (jj) is a version control system with a
significantly simplified mental model and command-line interface compared to Git, without
sacrificing expressibility or power (in fact, you could argue Jujutsu is more powerful).
Stacked-diff workflows, seamless rebases, and ephemeral revisions are all natural with jj, and it
uses Git as a backend, which means you can begin using it non-destructively with a single command
and can always drop back down to Git if you need to.</description>

      <title>Mentoring junior engineers in the age of coding agents</title>
      <link>https://blog.marcua.net/2025/07/21/mentoring-junior-engineers-in-the-age-of-coding-agents.html</link>
      <description>A decent amount of digital ink has been spilled about the future of software engineering in light of increasingly powerful coding agents. Will software engineers, especially junior ones, be able to find jobs in the future as coding agents become more powerful? I‚Äôm not a futurist, so I‚Äôll make some observations informed by my own increasingly productive use of coding agents like Claude Code and Aider: Today‚Äôs best coding agents still very much require a human operator, To effectively use these coding agents in a professional context, you have to make some big changes to how you work, and There are many elements of professional software engineering that coding agents don‚Äôt meaningfully enhance.</description>
