      <title>The Frink is Good, the Unit is Evil • Hillel Wayne</title>
      <link>https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/frink/</link>
      <description>One day Alan Eliasen read a fart joke and got so mad he invented a programming language. 20 years later Frink is one of the best special purpose languages for dealing with units.
“But why do we need a language just for dealing with units?” Glad you asked!
Intro to Units A unit is the physical property a number represents, like distance or time. We almost always are talking about SI units, or Système international.</description>

      <title>The Value of Alternative Investments · Sturm Mabie</title>
      <link>https://cryptm.org/posts/2020/07/09/alt.html</link>
      <description>A retail investor would be forgiven for assuming that there are really
only two assets classes one should consider for personal investments:
equities (stocks) and fixed income (bonds). Wherever you look, these two
asset classes dominate the financial landscape. All robo-advisors and
most personal advisors implement a mix of bonds and equities for the
portfolio's of their clients. The idea behind this mix is simple: bonds
are low risk and will earn you a marginal return, while equities are
riskier and will be the real engine of returns in good times. In bad
times, bonds will rise, mitigating some of the losses of your equity
portfolio: it's been long known and accepted that stocks and bonds have
a negative correlation. Tying this strategy together is periodic
rebalancing, taking money off the table during bull markets (and moving
them to the safer bonds), and deploying money to the equity portion
during bear markets. This in effect overlays a mean-reversion strategy
onto the portfolio, boosting the returns of an otherwise static
portfolio. The archetypal allocation is 60% equities, and 40% bonds,
though each investor's allocation is going to differ based on his risk
tolerance, age, and personal goals.</description>

      <title>Strong Generalization and Efficiency in Neural Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03629</link>
      <description>We study the problem of learning efficient algorithms that strongly
generalize in the framework of neural program induction. By carefully designing
the input / output interfaces of the neural model and through imitation, we are
able to learn models that produce correct results for arbitrary input sizes,
achieving strong generalization. Moreover, by using reinforcement learning, we
optimize for program efficiency metrics, and discover new algorithms that
surpass the teacher used in imitation. With this, our approach can learn to
outperform custom-written solutions for a variety of problems, as we tested it
on sorting, searching in ordered lists and the NP-complete 0/1 knapsack
problem, which sets a notable milestone in the field of Neural Program
Induction. As highlights, our learned model can perform sorting perfectly on
any input data size we tested on, with $O(n log n)$ complexity, whilst
outperforming hand-coded algorithms, including quick sort, in number of
operations even for list sizes far beyond those seen during training.</description>

      <description>The LibreOffice project would
seem to be on a roll.  It produces what is widely seen as the leading
free office-productivity suite, and has managed to move out of the shadow
of the moribund (but brand-recognized) Apache
OpenOffice project.  The 
LibreOffice 7 release is coming within a month, and the tenth
anniversary of the founding of the Document Foundation arrives in
September.  Meanwhile, LibreOffice
Online is taking off and, seemingly, seeing some market success.
So it is a bit surprising to see the project's core developers
in a sort of crisis mode while users worry about a tag that showed up in
the project's repository.</description>

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU-isq-PQ_Y</link>
      <description>A recorded live stream, where we go ahead and install SignalR onto an ASP.NET Core MVC API &amp; React application.

From there, we will create an endpoint in our API where we can send messages to. After that, the API will send out a message to all clients connected stating that the message has been received.

The React application is used to send messages through SignalR. It also is used as a listener, where it receives any message that SignalR sends out.</description>

      <title>Pokémon Sprite Decompression Done By Hand</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVwnUH8Eek</link>
      <description>Donate to The Bail Project here: https://donate.tiltify.com/@retro-game-mechanics-explained/decompress

Don't know what's going on? Check out the video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF1Yw_wu2cM

Webapp for decompressing &amp; compressing sprites: http://www.dotsarecool.com/rgme/tech/gen1decompress.html

During this livestream, I will be collecting donations for The Bail Project. The Bail Project is a non-profit organization that aims to pay bail for those faced with unaffordable cash bail. While bail is intended to be used as an incentive to return to trial, in the recent years it has been used unfairly as a form of pretrial detention. After bail is returned, The Bail Project uses the same money to pay additional bail for others. For more information on The Bail Project, please visit https://bailproject.org/ .

Donations will be done through Tiltify, so your money will be sent directly to The Bail Project without going through me first. Additionally, advertisements and other monetizations like super chats will be disabled for this livestream.
