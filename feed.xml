      <description>This blog post explores how Nietzsche&amp;#39;s concept of Eternal Return applies to software program management and planning, particularly in startups.

      <description>The article discusses the challenges faced by scalable data teams in managing and processing large amounts of data and proposes a system that includes separating storage, compute, and metadata, using distributed file systems and columnar data formats, real-time data ingestion with CDC tools, and efficient querying through composable components and a joint query/compute engine.</description>

      <title>I&amp;#39;ll read it – Manu</title>
      <link>https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it</link>
      <description>&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what to write about&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;what if no one will read it?&amp;quot;. These are the two most common reasons why people don&amp;#39;t want to start a personal blog. I already addressed the first one, so let me tackle the second one in the easiest way possible: I&amp;#39;ll read it. If you decide to start a blog in either English or Italian, I&amp;#39;ll read it. I don&amp;#39;t care about the topic. Start a blog, write something, send it to me, and I&amp;#39;ll read it. And you&amp;#39;ll have your first reader. If you add an RSS feed to your blog, I&amp;#39;ll add you to my reading list, and I&amp;#39;ll keep reading what you post. As soon as a bunch of you have blogs, I&amp;#39;ll compile a list and make it available on this site. Hopefully, more people will read what you write. But I promise you that if you start writing, you&amp;#39;ll have a reader.</description>

      <title>Do multi-gaming apps make sense?</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2023/04/09/multi-vs-single-gaming.html</link>
      <description>I’ve been thinking about multi-gaming platforms due to their recent meteoric rise to capture about 10% of the RMG market and the fact that I have to make a decision at work on bundling a mini-game with our main app. The multi-gaming segment is also growing at about 40% y-o-y which is the highest among all RMG segments. While one can argue that this growth was mostly driven by monstrous advertisement spends, this document tries to dig a bit deeper into the user behavior/personas between Multi Gaming Platforms and Single Gaming Platforms, framework to define value of adding/removing each game in the bundle, mental models for packaging games and finally some perspectives on user requirements/needs and way forward for building multi gaming apps. We want to basically explore why everybody is packaging games together or building yet another subscription service?</description>

      <link>https://nestenius.se/2022/01/18/how-i-built-my-own-sega-mega-drive-hardware-dev-kit-from-scratch/</link>
      <description>About 30 years ago (when I was around 20) I wanted to develop games, like most developers dream of doing. However, I had one open question: which platform should I write it for? Of course I could do it on the Atari 1040 STE that I had at the time, but I wanted to aim higher and do something cooler and more challenging.</description>

      <title>Working With GPT</title>
      <link>https://danangell.com/blog/posts/working-with-gpt/</link>
      <description>The programmer internet is polarizing over ChatGPT. Some claim that it is nearly AGI, some claim it cannot do anything of value, with plenty of people in between. I’ve worked with GPT-3 professionally, used CoPilot for over a year, and recently started programming side-projects with the assistance of ChatGPT (I pay for GPT-4 access). I’m considering working with LLMs full time again, so I pay close attention to what the GPT models can actually do.</description>
