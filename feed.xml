      <link>https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/dram/zenhammer/</link>
      <description>Our work shows that it is possible to trigger Rowhammer bit flips on DDR4 devices on AMD Zen 2 and Zen 3 systems despite deployed TRR mitigations. This result proves that AMD systems are equally vulnerable to Rowhammer as Intel systems, which greatly increases the attack surface, considering today’s AMD market share of around 36%… Read</description>

      <title>Notes on debugging HotSpot’s JIT compilation</title>
      <link>https://jornvernee.github.io/hotspot/jit/2023/08/18/debugging-jit.html</link>
      <description>Typically when you compile a Java program, it is first compiled into bytecode by a Java compiler. However, this bytecode is not optimized yet. In HotSpot (OpenJDK’s JVM) this instead happens at runtime, and is done by a JIT, a Just-In-Time compiler. This way of doing things allows the JIT to take maximum advantage of the conditions that the code is running in, such as hardware, and even to a certain degree the specific data that is fed into the program.</description>

      <description>Almost all projects I&amp;#39;ve worked on have scripts we wrote to automate a repetitive process. Consecutively, the majority of the scripts became obsolete and unmaintainable after some weeks, because we either didn&amp;#39;t need them anymore or they have become too complex to be looked at. Afterwards, these scripts are either refactored or they stay forever in the scripts graveyard</description>
