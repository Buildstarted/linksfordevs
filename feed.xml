      <title>mjg59 | The GPU, not the TPM, is the root of hardware DRM</title>
      <link>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/70954.html</link>
      <description>As part of their &amp;quot;Defective by Design&amp;quot; anti-DRM campaign, the FSF recently made the following claim:Today, most of the major streaming media platforms utilize the TPM to decrypt media streams, forcefully placing the decryption out of the user&amp;#39;s control (from here).This is part of an overall argument that Microsoft&amp;#39;s insistence that only hardware with a TPM can run Windows 11 is with the goal of aiding streaming companies in their attempt to ensure media can only be played in tightly constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Fluent Builder Design Pattern in C#</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=_qdLpojlAoQ</link>

The Fluent builder pattern is a powerful creational design pattern that offers a structured approach to constructing complex objects. It provides a solution to the telescoping constructor problem by encapsulating the logic for object creation in a separate builder class. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with objects that have numerous optional parameters or when the object construction process involves multiple steps. In C#, the Builder pattern can be implemented with a fluent interface, resulting in a highly expressive and readable API. This approach allows developers to chain method calls, creating a more intuitive and flexible way of constructing objects.

This video tutorial will guide you through the process of implementing the fluent builder pattern in C#. You&amp;#39;ll learn how to create a builder class, implement method chaining, and construct complex objects step by step.</description>

      <title>Year of embracing curiosity</title>
      <link>https://kg.dev/thoughts/embracing-curiosity</link>
      <description>Resolutions don’t work. Though it may be limited to my own social bubble, it seems like most people have come to this same conclusion. What does seem to work, though, is themes. You choose a theme and use it as a guiding principle for the countless decisions you’ll face throughout the year.This will be my 4th year of using the theme-based resolution method. I usually take the holiday break to think about what sort of theme would truly make a difference in my life were I to focus on it for a whole year. For the past two weeks, I’ve thought deeply about this and have come up with my theme:Year of embracing curiosityTo those unfamiliar with this method, it may seem oddly vague. The absence of metrics, accountability, or even a clear goal makes it feel like just another sentence. But this is the whole point of a theme: the antithesis of the familiar disappointment that typical resolutions bring – a guiding light on the unbeaten path of a new year.So, why this theme? Phrases like “I just don’t understand,” “that’s over my head,” or “I’m not smart enough for this” have always left a bitter taste in my mouth. Yet, I often find myself relying on them. I’ve denied myself knowledge with the underlying notion that my brain wasn’t wired to understand certain things.Over the last decade, I’ve done away with certain phrases that I didn’t want to be associated with anymore:- I’m bored- I’m lazy- I regret xyzI don’t say these anymore – ever. Phrases like that carve the version of you that exists in your head. This year, I’ll be discontinuing any phrases hinting at an aversion to embracing curiosity. Instead, when I come across something unfamiliar or daunting in complexity, I want to approach it with curiosity. I want to ask more questions about it, do research, and maybe even master a few topics.I’m starting 2025 by learning Vim – an open-source method for editing text and code. It’s something that I always found intimidating due to its complexity and steep learning curve, but I’m already 2 weeks in and getting the hang of it. Throughout the year, I plan on tackling other things that I found to be too hard for me to understand or master. Things such as higher-level math, C (programming language), kickboxing, the tax code, and sales.With enough time and effort, anything can be learned.2025 - Year of embracing curiosity2024 - Year of dedicated focus2023 - Year of leap of faith2022 - Year of travel</description>

      <title>Async I/O Is Not Enough</title>
      <link>https://astronautas.github.io/2024/12/28/async-io-is-not-enough.html</link>
      <description>For the past few months, I’ve been exploring Go. Having done quite a bit of grueling work shaving off milliseconds from Python web apps, I’ve found Go to be incredible. You can schedule dirt cheap concurrent operations — simply by adding go in front of a function call — and achieve true parallelism across cores.</description>

      <description>One of my papers got declined today by the journal I submitted it to, with a polite letter saying that while they found the paper interesting, it was not a good fit for the journal.  In truth, I largely agreed with their conclusions, and the paper is now submitted to a different (and hopefully more appropriate) journal.

Rejection is actually a relatively common occurrence for me, happening once or twice a year on average.  I occasionally mention this fact to my students and colleagues, who are sometimes surprised that my rejection rate is far from zero.  I have belatedly realized our profession is far more willing to announce successful accomplishments (such as having a paper accepted, or a result proved) than unsuccessful ones (such as a paper rejected, or a proof attempt not working), except when the failures are somehow controversial.  Because of this, a perception can be created that all of one&amp;#39;s peers are achieving either success or controversy, with one&amp;#39;s own personal career ending up becoming the only known source of examples of &amp;quot;mundane&amp;quot; failure.  I speculate that this may be a contributor to the &amp;quot;impostor syndrome&amp;quot; that is prevalent in this field (though, again, not widely disseminated, due to the aforementioned reporting bias, and perhaps also due to some stigma regarding the topic).  So I decided to report this (rather routine) rejection as a token gesture towards more accurate disclosure.   (1/2)</description>
