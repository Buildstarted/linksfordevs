      <description>You can find audio to this post here.
The Garage Sale It was the summer of 1996, and I was a carefree kid whose only goal in life where to ride my bike faster and farther each day. Sega Genesis was the console of choice, soon to be blown up by the Nintendo 64. Kids were still shouting, “To infinity and beyond.”
Garage sales were still a thing people regularly did, and you could often find hidden gems there.</description>

      <title>Developing and Maintaining Gratitude</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2021/gratitude/</link>
      <description>As I reflect back on 2020, a year that was tough on human civilisation
as a whole, I am nevertheless grateful for the many positive experiences
of this year. This post is not a ‘humblebrag’ or a denial of the many
negative things of 20201, but rather a brief recipe and reminder to
my future self to&amp;#160;(further) develop and maintain an attitude of
gratitude. This post is written in the form of questions that I used to
ask myself, as well as the current set of answers I came up with. It is
my hope that readers will find some wisdom here.</description>

      <link>https://www.jmilinovich.com/blog/startup-decision-making/</link>
      <description>As a startup founder, it&amp;#39;s mission critical to know what decisions you should make quickly, and which you should make slowly. It&amp;#39;s common to think that at the earliest stage your approach should be to, &amp;quot;move fast and break things&amp;quot;, but not only did Facebook ditch that approach, there&amp;#39;s mounting evidence that it was never a good idea in the first place.</description>

      <title>Make smaller console apps with .NET and CoreRT - { Destructured }</title>
      <link>https://blog.kalalau-cantrell.com/2021/01/make-smaller-console-apps-with-net-and-corert/</link>
      <description>There’s something satisfying about slimming down an app’s executable file(s) to be as small as possible. It’s not unlike the joy of removing dead code from a codebase; or, to use a non-programming example, the satisfaction of emptying your home of clutter. It feels good to remove clutter, whether that clutter is unneeded lines of code, bloated file sizes, or things in your home that you just don’t need anymore.</description>
