      <title>Open, rigorous and reproducible research: A practitioner’s handbook</title>
      <link>https://stanforddatascience.github.io/best-practices/index.html</link>
      <description>Even though many scientists are expected to abide by the principles of open, rigorous and reproducible research, few scientists actually receive formal training in this. Indeed, there is no collection written by workings scientis for working scientists about the principles of open, rigorous and transparent research and how to go about practicing such research, beyond theory. This handbook represents a constantly updated guide aiming to fulfil this gap and by doing so actively assist all researchers in producing informative research.</description>

A couple of days ago at work we announced the Steam Deck OLED.  It’s available next week (Nov 16) and though it’s got a bunch of great improvements like longer battery life, faster downloads, the star is the ultra-bright HDR OLED screen. 

The screens are ridiculously bright and vibrant, so we thought it would be fun to use actual Steam Deck OLEDs as lighting sources to light our entire launch trailer.

However, the problem with CPUs is that they rely</description>

      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2023/11/12/quitting-fulltime-poker.html</link>
      <description>I used to play Poker for a living from 2018-2021. These days whenever I recount my past with new people, everyone inevitably asks me why I stopped playing the game (full time) if it was profitable to do so. Its understandably hard to comprehend why anybody would stop pursuing a money making endeavour. So, I want to write this post to summarily answer most questions around this topic and mostly because I am tired of repeating myself again and again.</description>
