      <description>Around 6-ish years ago, NodeJS really hit it’s peak in popularity. In part, it was because people had no choice but to learn Javascript because of the popularity of front end JS frameworks at the time, so why not learn a backend that uses Javascript too? But also I think it was because of the […]</description>

      <title>Cryptographers unearth vulnerabilities in Telegram&amp;#39;s encryption protocol - CyberScoop</title>
      <link>https://www.cyberscoop.com/telegram-app-security-encryption/</link>
      <description>An international team of computer scientists reported on Friday that they found four cryptographic vulnerabilities in the popular encrypted message app Telegram. The weaknesses range “from technically trivial and easy to exploit to more advanced and of theoretical interest,” according to the security analysis. But ultimately they prove that the four key issues “could be done better, more securely and in a more trustworthy manner with a standard approach to cryptography,” said ETH Zurich Professor Kenny Paterson, who was part of the team that uncovered the flaw. The most significant of the vulnerabilities the researchers uncovered is what they called the “crime-pizza” vulnerability. In it, an attacker could alter the order of messages coming from a client to a cloud server that Telegram operates. “For example, if the order of the messages in the sequence ‘I say “yes” to’, ‘pizza’, ‘I say “no” to’, “crime” was altered then it would […]</description>

      <title>Looking Glass - Looking Glass</title>

This is possible through the use of a shared memory segment which enables extremely high throughput low latency guest to host communication.</description>
