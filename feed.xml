      <title>Today’s Javascript, from an outsider’s perspective – Lea Verou</title>
      <link>https://lea.verou.me/2020/05/todays-javascript-from-an-outsiders-perspective/</link>
      <description>Today I tried to help a friend who is a great computer scientist, but not a JS person use a JS module he found on Github. Since for the past 6 years my day job is doing usability research &amp;amp; teaching at MIT, I couldn’t help but cringe at the slog that this was. Lo and behold, a pile of unnecessary error conditions, cryptic errors, and lack of proper feedback. And I don’t feel I did a good job communicating the frustration he went through in the one hour or so until he gave up.</description>

      <title>OpenTelemetry .NET Automatic Instrumentation Releases its first Beta</title>
      <link>https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2022/dotnet-instrumentation-first-beta/</link>
      <description>We’re excited to announce the first beta release of the OpenTelemetry .NET Automatic Instrumentation project!
Without this project, .NET developers need to use instrumentation packages to automatically generate telemetry data. For example, to instrument inbound ASP.NET Core requests, you need to use the ASP.NET Core instrumentation package and initialize it with the OpenTelemetry SDK.
Now with the .NET Automatic Instrumentation project, developers can run the agent side-by-side with their application and get telemetry automatically.</description>

      <title>Answer engines</title>
      <link>https://seirdy.one/notes/2022/05/25/answer-engines.html</link>
      <description>Reply to Is DuckDuckGo, DuckDuckDone? by Kev Quirk  I read your article and share similar concerns. Using Microsoft Bing and Google Search’s commercial APIs generally requires accepting some harsh terms, including a ban on mixing SERPs from multiple sources (this is why Ixquick shut down and the company pivoted to the Google-exclusive Startpage search service). But the requirement to allow trackers in a companion web browser was new to me. Most of these agreements are confidential, so users don’t really get transparency. On rare occasions, certain engines have successfully negotiated exceptions to result-mixing, but we don’t know what other terms are involved in these agreements. I’ve catalogued some other engines in my post A look at search engines with their own indexes , and there are many alternatives that don’t have this conflict of interest. Most of these are not as good as Google/Bing when it comes to finding specific pieces of information, but many are far better when it comes to website discovery under a particular topic.</description>

      <title>Why are tools such as Docker and Kubernetes written in Go and not C#? : csharp</title>
      <link>https://teddit.mha.fi/r/csharp/comments/uxh2oa/why_are_tools_such_as_docker_and_kubernetes/</link>
      <description>A lot of new tools that devs use seem to be written in Go. But why not C#? I know that C# and .Net is more than capable. Is it a lack of that kind of culture? How can we foster a more open source culture because it still seems like a lot of devs have old prejudices towards C# and .Net. I think having more interesting and useful open source tools written in C# would go a long way to change perceptions.</description>
