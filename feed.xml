      <title>How to do Validation in Windows and Uno Platform Applications - the Easy Way - Nick's .NET Travels</title>
      <link>https://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/winui-validation/</link>
      <description>Quite often I hear the complaint that WinUI, and thus Uno Platform, doesn’t include validation.

      <description>The command 'mkdir' is often followed by 'cd' to the same directory, suggesting 'mkcd'. I analyze my usage, look for the origin of 'mkcd', and implement it for fish.</description>

      <link>https://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/stop-using-mvvm/</link>
      <description>The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern has long been a cornerstone in building maintainable and testable UIs across frameworks like WPF, Xamarin, Uno Platform, and others. It provides a clean separation of concerns and enables powerful data binding. But despite its popularity and maturity, MVVM often introduces unnecessary complexity and friction—particularly when it comes to state management ... Read more</description>

      <title>Let me pay for Firefox!</title>
      <link>https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/let-me-pay-for-firefox/141297</link>

I was active in the Spread Firefox project, where I ran a contest that encouraged others to promote Firefox in the most creative ways they could imagine. In hindsight, I guess it could have been called a...</description>
