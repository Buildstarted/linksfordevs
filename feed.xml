      <title>Vibe Coding Is Fun‚ÄîBut Vibe Refactoring Pays the Bills</title>
      <link>https://dawidmakowski.com/en/2025/04/vibe-coding-is-fun-but-vibe-refactoring-pays-the-bills/</link>
      <description>So let‚Äôs flip the script to something that actually compounds: vibe refactoring. Same spontaneous energy, but aimed at shrinking technical debt and sharpening your architecture instead of amping up the commit count.</description>

      <title>The Seven-Year Rule - MacSparky</title>
      <link>https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2025/04/the-seven-year-rule/</link>
      <description>Years ago, I encountered a fascinating concept in a book by the Dalai Lama: every seven years, human beings transform into entirely new versions of themselves. This idea stems from the biological principle that our bodies replace virtually all their cells over a seven-year cycle. The person you are today doesn‚Äôt share a single cell...

      <title>TPSV</title>
      <link>https://chtenb.dev/?page=tpsv</link>
      <description>Despite CSV (Comma-Separated-Values) being ubiquitous, its cousin TSV (Tab-Separated-Values) has
direct advantages over CSV in many situations. Tab characters don‚Äôt
normally occur in the data being encoded, which avoids the need for
quoting. Moreover, if your columns all have a similar width, you can
configure the tab-width in any text editor such that all columns align
nicely. Unfortunately, in many cases columns do not have a similar
width.</description>

      <title>An end to all this prostate trouble?</title>
      <link>https://yarchive.net/blog/prostate/</link>
      <description>The prostate gland causes entirely too many problems.  In the US,
prostate cancer kills about one man of every forty.  ‚ÄúBenign
prostate hyperplasia‚Äù (BPH) is even more common, affecting most
men over age 60.  It pinches the urinary tract, making it hard to
urinate, and is constantly in danger of transforming from
‚Äúbenign‚Äù to ‚Äúmalignant‚Äù.  Even the difficulty urinating is enough
of a problem that men often get surgery for it, usually TURP, a
sort of roto-rooter job (except cutting through the pipe instead
of just cleaning it out).</description>

      <title>Strategic Networking For Software Engineers - Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=h9N46FX0snM</link>
      <description>Everyone is focused on getting their LeetCode skills ramped up and building side projects -- two things I think definitely help when it comes to interviewing in general.

But... you're not even getting interviews. What's going on? How are those OTHER people doing it?! Let's discuss some options.

As with all livestreams, I'm looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.
