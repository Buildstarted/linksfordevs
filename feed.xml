      <title>What I did on my winter vacation</title>
      <link>https://blog.urth.org/2021/01/09/what-i-did-on-my-winter-vacation/</link>
      <description>TLDR: Helped my father move. Then I shaved all the yaks. Fur everywhere. Very messy.
Because of the way holidays at ActiveState work, it’s very economical in terms of vacation days to take the last two weeks of the year off (Christmas and New year’s weeks).
