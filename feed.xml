      <title>New Improved Attach to Process Dialog Experience</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/new-improved-attach-to-process-dialog-experience/</link>
      <description>With Visual Studio 2022, we promise to bring new tooling to improve the inner loop productivity and debugging experience. In addition, we have several exciting debugging updates, and the new attach to process dialog experience is one of them. We have added command-line details, app pool details, parent/child process tree view, and the Select running window from the desktop option in the attach to process dialog. This makes it convenient to find the right process you need to attach. Also, the Attach to Process dialog is now asynchronous, making it interactive even when the process list is updating. All these features should be available in the latest Visual Studio 2022 preview version.</description>

      <title>Google APIs: authentication with TypeScript | I CAN MAKE THIS WORK</title>
      <link>https://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2021/09/10/google-apis-authentication-with-typescript/</link>
      <description>Google has a wealth of APIs which we can interact with.  At the time of writing, there&amp;#39;s more than two hundred available; including YouTube, Google Calendar and GMail (alongside many others). To integrate with these APIs, it&amp;#39;s necessary to authenticate and then use that credential with the API. This post will take you through how to do just that using TypeScript. It will also demonstrate how to use one of those APIs: the Google Calendar API.</description>

      <link>https://news.mit.edu/2021/MIT-CFS-major-advance-toward-fusion-energy-0908</link>

The demonstration helps resolve the greatest uncertainty in the quest to build the first fusion power plant that can produce more energy than it consumes, according to project leaders at MIT and startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS).</description>

      <link>https://www.arahansen.com/the-compiled-future-of-front-end/</link>
      <description>When I learned React in 2014 it was a revelation. Coming from Angular 1, React was a breath of fresh air in a world full of foot-guns, confusing best practices, and unclear jargon (services, models, directives, oh my!) Instead, the future was simple: &amp;quot;everything is a component&amp;quot;. Components have props,</description>

      <link>https://mentor-crypto-2021.github.io/</link>
      <description>This workshop aims to provide advice for researchers in early stages (students and junior faculty) and women researchers in the area of cryptography. The workshop will bring together cryptography researchers at different stages of their career to form panels and answer questions for these groups. Besides the live events, the organizers will turn to a large group of cryptography researchers and collect pre-recorded answers and advice from them on a list of interesting questions. These answers will be combined into a set of videos showing various perspectives and be publicly available for the community. As the outcome of this workshop, our mission is to foster a friendly environment where the community can openly share their academic experiences.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I found this Hacker News post about the AirGradient DIY Air Quality Monitor. I had already been considering buying an AirThings Wave Plus sensor to monitor my home&amp;#39;s CO2 levels, but the high price and limited &amp;#39;ownership&amp;#39; of the data coming from it turned me off.</description>
