      <title>.NET Conf 2024 - Day 2</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=aSj4Z8MMfkQ</link>
      <description>Full agenda: https://dotnetconf.net/agenda

.NET Conf has been a virtual event since the beginning, and this year we’re celebrating our 14th online conference. We always strive to create a world class, engaging, virtual experience for all our attendees no matter where they are. Over the years we&amp;#39;ve expanded our content and our reach. We now draw over 100 thousand live viewers and sponsor hundreds of local events around the world.

Over the course of the three days we provide a wide selection of live sessions that feature speakers from the community and .NET team members. We have sessions streaming 24/7 between day two and three of the conference so everyone can get involved no matter what their time zone. You can ask questions live on Twitter, join the fun on Twitch, attend the virtual attendee parties where you can play trivia games and win prizes. Best of all, you can take what you learn here and be a better .NET developer.

      <title>Grouping Smarter: LINQ GroupBy Enhancements in EF Core - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/grouping-smarter-linq-groupby-enhancements-in-ef-core/</link>
      <description>Grouping data in Entity Framework Core (EF Core) used to feel a little… clunky. Sometimes, LINQ’s GroupBy() worked beautifully in-memory but got lost in translation when executing SQL queries. You’d write a simple GroupBy(), and EF Core would pull all the data into memory before doing the grouping—not good! But things are getting smarter and more efficient in recent versions of EF Core! With LINQ GroupBy enhancements, EF Core now translates more grouping operations into optimized SQL queries, saving memory and improving performance.</description>

      <link>https://phaazon.net/blog/zig-2025</link>
      <description>Ah, Zig. I have a love-hate relationship with this one. A “new” (reading: appeared a couple years ago,
already — yes, already), language with high ambitions. Zig was made to run at low-level, with a simple design
to solve many problems C has (macros, allocators, error handling, more powerful types like baked-in tagged
unions and bitsets, a better build system, no hidden control flow, etc.). The language claims to be the C
successor, and today, many people claim that Zig is simpler and even safer than most languages out there —
even Rust! — allowing to focus more on the technical challenges around your problem space rather
than — quoting from the Zig mantra — your language knowledge. I think I need to put the full mantra
because I will reuse it through this article:</description>

      <description>One of the first things new French learners notice early on is just how hard the language is to understand. It’s not obvious to most French learners why this is; only that French seems to become significantly harder when it moves from words on a page to words coming out of a person’s mouth.</description>

- training set
- weights
- constraints on the model
- layers between you and the model that transform both your input and the model&amp;#39;s output that can change at any time
- availability of compute for your specific query</description>
