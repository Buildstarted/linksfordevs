      <description>We recently got back from a big trip, and that reminded me I’ve been meaning to publish a tip on how Trello has saved me a lot of time and hassle around travel – and how to set it up so that it can benefit you as well. I’m a big fan of kanban boards in general but this may have helped me more than any other.</description>

      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1859</link>
      <description>How is Chocolatey evolving? Carl and Richard talk to Gary Ewan Park about the latest with the open-source Windows package management solution. Gary discusses some of the differences between the various package managers for Windows these days, including WinGet. Each product has its niche, and Chocolatey has done a good job of evolving into a broader product, including Chocolatey for Business, to allow a view of applications installed across all your machines - and being able to push updates out to them.</description>

      <title>How to DIY home security</title>
      <link>https://vedard.com/blog/how-to-diy-home-security/</link>
      <description>How to DIY home security? It is easy to buy an IP camera and place it in the living room and remote monitor your home. But it is not enough to secure your home. To completely secure your home and prevent any intrusion, you need to know how to choose the detectors, where to install the detectors and how to set up the home security system. We will analyze the actual case of home security solution. We hope that can help you understanding home anti-theft and monitoring systems.
Step1:Determine the scope of prevention according to the home situation

From Figure 1, we can see that the 2 balconies and doors are in the most vulnerable areas. The second one is the kitchen and the study room windows (because the study room and kitchen are usually unoccupied, especially at night, they are usually vacant, which can easily become the entrance of thieves). The third is the master bedroom ①, children’s room ② and bathroom ③. So we firstly determined the areas that need to be protected. Then we need to determine the priority of the prevention area (the intrusion position is indicated by the priority of the prevention in the figure)
Step 2:Determine the defense area and the prevention method and equipment of each defense
After the location and area that are vulnerable to intrusion are determined, we need to determine the prevention method and equipment for each defense area.  It is better to have all areas protected. But if the environment situation and community security is good, you can only have the main entrance areas protected.

1)Basic home security solution
This security solution only set defense areas of gate, both balconies, kitchen, and study room. Wireless door contacts are used for protection of gate, kitchen and study room. PIR motion sensors are used for protection of living room and bed room.
When the gate or study room, kitchen room door or windows are open, or body motion detected in living room and bed room, the detector will trigger alarm panel and loud sound siren strobe goes alarm, at the same time, alarm signal will be sent to mobile phone or security service center.
The shortage: When using door contact, the windows should be closed even in summer. Bathroom and children room is not protected and with security hazard.
2)Complete home security solution

On the basis of basic home security solution, one added infrared detector is installed in children’s room, living room and study room, and one door magnetic detector is installed in the window of the bathroom. In this way, we have completed a basic family anti-theft system, and at the same time, double detection equipment is installed in the key defense area (gate and study room)
When the gate or the study room, kitchen, bathroom window is opened, or have human body movement detected in balcony, children room, study room, the alarm will go off. At the same time, double defend of different types sensors installed in gate and study room to ensure the defense of the main entrance.
The shortage: although all the indoor scope has been in the protection, but the passive infrared detector can only active after the invasion. The perimeter protection of the balcony and the window is not very effective with door contact.
3)Improved home security solution

In order to solve the problem that the balcony and windows intruders can not be prevented at first time. We installed infrared barriers on the balcony and windows, and remove some indoor infrared detectors.
So, the infrared barriers outside the balcony and windows can promptly alarm when someone approaches the balcony and the window. Keep the intruder outside, prevent the intruder from entering the room. The improved home security solution can better protect the personal and property safety.
Shortages:&amp;#160;No video monitoring function and linkage equipment, and unable to use technical means to retain evidence while alarming

Step3: Optional equipment to enhance the prevention function
Based on the above setting, we can choose smart detectors or microwave detectors to replace the above ordinary infrared detectors; add harmful gas detectors in the kitchen, Add linkage lighting control equipment in the living room (when someone approaches the window, the lights in the living room will automatically turn on when the alarm is issued); the door is equipped with a digital anti-theft lock; the glass is equipped with a vibration detector to further enhance the prevention ability.&amp;#160;One thing to note is that, while focusing on new technologies and new products, security products should also focus on stable and mature conventional and reliable ability.</description>

      <title>Home Assistant compatible desk fan (120mm) – Tristam</title>
      <link>https://tristam.ie/2023/663/</link>
      <description>Frustrated by the lack of fans that integrate with Home Assistant, I decided to modify this 120mm fan stand  to include a compartment for a Wemos D1 mini and a buck converter. This allows us to run ESPHome on a Wemos D1 mini which outputs a 25khz PWM signal to control the speed of an off the shelf 120mm computer fan. The whole setup is powered from a single micro USB port and with this fan, draws a max of 0.3A at 5v so it’ll run off a power bank for hours.</description>

      <description>In 2020 I wanted to create annotated charts showing events influencing the COVID-19 numbers. I looked around and didn’t find great ways to do it, so of course, as a software engineer, I started building a thing: contextualize.ai.
Fast forward many weekends, and lots and lots of hours around my 9-5s, I get the project to a level where I’m not absolutely embarrassed by around a month ago and start building and sharing charts with it.</description>

      <title>My bug finding chronicles (and how to earn money through vulnerability research)</title>
      <link>https://mijailovic.net/2023/08/16/bug-finding-chronicles/</link>
      <description>At least one person has asked me about my thought process when searching for denial-of-service
vulnerabilities: how do I choose the target libraries, what specifically I look for in them, etc.
“At least one person” meaning “exactly one person”, and that one person happens to be my wife, but
I decided to write a whole post on this topic anyway! In this half-memoir,
half-tutorial post, I’ll show you the most interesting bugs I’ve found so far and the methods I
used to find them. I wouldn’t say I have any advanced bug finding skills, but I do know a few useful
techniques, so I hope you will learn something new today.</description>

      <title>You don&amp;#39;t hate JIRA, you hate your manager</title>
      <link>https://jarvispowered.com/you-dont-hate-jira-you-hate-your-manager/</link>
      <description>It seems like it has become popular to hate on JIRA. In fact, a good friend of mine sent me this, which is what triggered this post: (if you&amp;#39;re the owner of the image, reach out to me and I&amp;#39;ll attribute it properly) I&amp;#39;m usually…</description>

      <title>Tales from the .NET Migration Trenches - Intro</title>
      <link>https://www.jimmybogard.com/tales-from-the-net-migration-trenches/</link>
      <description>Over the past year or so I&amp;#39;ve been part of a large-ish modernization effort, both migrating from .NET 4.8 to .NET 6 (the latest LTS at the time) and from an on-premise deployment to Azure. While these two workstreams were largely independent (luckily), we did have some dependencies between</description>

      <description>I didn’t want to write this for a long time. I feel disgusted, afraid, ashamed. I can’t write about everything I know because I have to protect the people who’ve saved my life. On February 24, 2022, my country attacked Ukraine.</description>
