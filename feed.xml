      <title>Desktop is Dead</title>
      <link>https://rusz.space/posts/os?hn=</link>
      <description>The desktop metaphor, first in the Xerox Alto and then the Macintosh, is now 52 years old. It was a good solution to the problem of making non-technical knowledge workers use the computer effectively. But the real fact is that the desktop metaphor has died, and it is limiting computers.</description>

      <title>Coding NEON kernels for the Cortex-A53 ‚Äì Daniel Est√©vez</title>
      <link>https://destevez.net/2025/02/coding-neon-kernels-for-the-cortex-a53/</link>
      <description>Some weeks ago, I presented at FOSDEM my work-in-progress high performance SDR runtime qsdr. I showed a hand-written NEON assembly implementation of a kernel that computes y[n]=ax[n]+b, which I used as the basic math block for benchmarks on a Kria KV260 board (which has a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 at 1.33 GHz). In that talk I glossed over the details of how I implemented this NEON kernel. There are enough tricks and considerations that I could make a full talk just out of explaining how to write this kernel. This will be the topic for this post.</description>
