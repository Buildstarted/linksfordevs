      <title>A Software Engineering Career Ladder</title>
      <link>https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2024/a-software-engineering-career-ladder</link>
      <description>I’ve been quiet lately, and that’s because I’ve joined OpenSesame as Vice President of Engineering. It’s been a fascinating opportunity to rebuild an engineering organization from the inside, and I’m loving every minute. We’re introducing a lot of cutting-edge software development practices, such as self-organizing vertically-scaled teams and Extreme Programming.</description>

      <title>things I tell myself to be more agentic – Daniel Frank</title>
      <link>https://danfrank.ca/things-i-tell-myself-to-be-more-agentic/</link>
      <description>This is written as a personal self-affirmation — my hope is that by writing it up and sharing it publicly, I will internalize these words more and act on them. In the context of this post, being agentic means being more ambitious, doing more things out in the world, putting myself out there more, and tolerating higher levels of rejection, discomfort, and failure.</description>

      <title>Harry Chapin and RATM: the problem with bleeding interests</title>
      <link>https://alexanderell.is/posts/playlist/</link>
      <description>Note: this post requires a basic familiarity with the songs discussed. If you’re not familiar with them, I’d recommend you listen to at least a portion of the following three songs:
 Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd (YouTube) Cat’s in the Cradle by Harry Chapin (YouTube) Killing In The Name by Rage Against The Machine (YouTube)   There are many musical genres I like, and what I listen to usually depends on my mood at the time.</description>

      <description>I converted Grant Jenks’s Python library Sorted Containers to Ruby. If you are interested in the details of this data structure, I recommend reading his website. His documentation is much more detailed, and I used it as a reference for this implementation.</description>

      <title>So what’s the point of linear algebra, anyway?</title>
      <link>https://chittur.dev/math/2024/04/21/linear-algebra.html</link>
      <description>Asking someone in a STEM field to justify linear algebra concepts is a bit like asking a Haskell programmer about monads. The best case scenario is that you’ll get a shrug and a “don’t worry about it, just learn when to use it”. The more common scenario is an hour-long explanation that leaves you more confused than when you started. In keeping with my lifelong passion for confusing and upsetting as many people as possible, today I would like to talk about linear algebra. (I’ll save the monads for a later date. Don’t worry, they’re just burritos.)</description>

      <title>Metric learning with linear methods - Emir&amp;#39;s blog</title>
      <link>https://emiruz.com/post/2024-04-24-metric-learning/</link>
      <description>I read this paper a
while ago, which sets out the problem of linear metric learning nicely but
then proceeds to solve it in a way I personally thought unnecessarily
indirect. It seemed to me that there was a neat analytical solution, so I
thought I’d have a go. It turned out to be quite straightforward.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on WASM</title>
      <link>https://matradomski.com/posts/wasm_thoughts/</link>
      <description>WASM has this great veil of misunderstanding around it and I don’t want to try to remove it because in the process I might end up creating more confusion. All I want to do is give you some ideas and experiences I’ve had writing a simple library in C, compiling it to WASM and using it from JavaScript. Because of timing, some soft requirements and pure curiosity I’ve ended up writing fast-solidity-parser.</description>

      <title>Fully Decentralized Forum With 60 Lines of Code</title>
      <link>https://zhangluyao.com/blog/how_bodhi_space_works/</link>
      <description>Try it here: Bodhi Space
Last year, I built a 100-line protocol called Bodhi, designed to store content and incentivize high-value content at a basic protocol level. If you’re intrigued about why this might work, you can check out the details here.
Theoretically, it can be used to build any kind of application (like Reddit, Twitter, or YouTube) with very few lines of code (less than 100 lines).
When I launched it in the Chinese community four months ago, it became popular among speculators, but many developers overlooked it, assuming it was just another speculative token project and not delving into the concept behind it.</description>
