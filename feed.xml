      <title>Query Tags: Debugging EF Core Like a Detective - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/query-tags-debugging-ef-core-like-a-detective/</link>
      <description>Imagine you’re a detective working on a big case. You’ve got a pile of clues (queries), but they’re all mixed together with no labels. Which one belongs to which part of the case? Frustrating, right? That’s what debugging EF Core queries feels like without Query Tags. But with Query Tags, it&amp;#39;s like a breath of fresh air, relieving the frustration and making the process more manageable. Query Tags in EF Core are like sticky notes for your SQL. They allow you to label your queries, making it significantly easier to track down problems, optimize performance, and appear as a debugging wizard.</description>

      <description>The .NET provided DI container has some means to check if the container can be created. This is useful to ensure that all dependencies can be resolved and that the container is correctly configured. Let&amp;#39;s have a quick look.

      <title>Why Codecation is Important: Taking a Break to Level Up</title>
      <link>https://kaldheim.org/posts/why-codecation-is-important/</link>
      <description>As software developers, we always talk about feeling burnt out, having to constantly switch gears, and trying to keep up with all the new tech stuff. We’re always racing against the clock to get projects done, putting out fires, and sitting through never-ending meetings. Eventually, our creative juices just run dry and our drive starts to fade.
This is where Codecation comes in — a dedicated time away from from the usual grind to really dive into coding, learn new stuff, and work on projects that you’re super passionate about, without all the usual distractions from everyday life.</description>

      <title>Semi-Open Heart Protocol</title>
      <link>https://ogbe.net/blog/semi-open-heart</link>
      <description>About a week ago, the Open Heart Protocol made its way to the front page of Hacker News. I immediately thought that this looked like a lot of fun and a cool opportunity to add some more bells and whistles to this website. There is a public API, but the devs (muan and robb) also provide some code examples to self-host the backend using the Cloudflare Workers free tier. Since I am already using Cloudflare for this website, I figured I&amp;#39;d give this a try. Surprising absolutely no-one, I had to add some slight customizations to my setup.</description>
