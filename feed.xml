      <title>Map Physical Paths with an HttpContext.MapPath() Extension Method in ASP.NET</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2023/Aug/15/Map-Physical-Paths-with-an-HttpContextMapPath-Extension-Method-in-ASPNET</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core doesn&amp;#39;t have a Server.MapPath() method as classic ASP.NET had, and getting at the root path in Core is a little bit more involved than in those older versions. In this post I describe how to find the application Content and Web root folders and describe a MapPath() helper that simulates the old behavior.</description>

      <description>I’m two weeks into owning a Remarkable 2. I spent at least a year, maybe two, circling around whether to get one or not and finally took the plunge at the end of July. Key to the whole project to me was spending less time staring at the glare. I wanted something to read and scribble on but without the distraction that comes with All The Things.</description>

      <title>The Irrational Planning Process – The Antiplanner</title>
      <link>https://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=21276</link>
      <description>Land-use and transportation planning is supposed to follow a rational planning process. That process includes defining the problem that needs to be solved, identifying alternative solutions, evaluating the alternatives, developing a final plan based on the best alternative or combination of alternatives, implementing the plan, monitoring the effects to see how well reality matches planning assumptions, and using the results of that monitoring as feedback into future plans.</description>

  A diamond is very pretty. But it is very hard to add to a diamond. A ball of mud is not so pretty. But you can always add more mud to a ball of mud.
– Gerald Sussman, paraphrasing Joel Moses
  A common problem with Emacs’ giant ball of shared state: Any code can step on the feet of any other – including yours.</description>
