                Excited to try it, I connected to the local network on the plane and scanned the QR code to purchase access.

      <description>OpenZFS 2.3.0 will be released any day now, and it includes the new “Fast Dedup” feature. My team at Klara spent many months in 2023 and 2024 working on it, and we reckon its pretty good, a huge step up from the old dedup as well as being a solid base for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Vulnerabilities of Realtek SD card reader driver, part 1</title>
      <link>https://zwclose.github.io/2024/10/14/rtsper1.html</link>
      <description>I discovered multiple vulnerabilities in RtsPer.sys, an SD card reader driver developed by Realtek. These vulnerabilities enable non-privileged users to leak the contents of kernel pool and kernel stack, write to arbitrary kernel memory, and, the most interesting, read and write physical memory from user mode via the DMA capability of the device. The vulnerabilities have remained undisclosed for years, affecting many OEMs, including Dell, Lenovo, and others. If your laptop is equipped with an SD card reader, it is highly likely to be manufactured by Realtek, making it susceptible to these vulnerabilities as well.</description>

that can complete simple request tests in under a second. In this article we’ll focus on
Rails apps. We’ll identify what causes a big app to take a long time to boot and run
simple tests and what we can do to improve the situation.</description>

      <title>Getting Ahead: Pathways to Comfortable Career Satisfaction for the Aspirational • Dylan Fitzgerald</title>
      <link>https://dylanfitzgerald.net/blog/comfortable-satisfaction-pathways-for-the-aspirational/</link>
      <description>Looking at software career options from an earlier place, many folks find themselves both aspiring for career growth and wanting not to be plugging in 60+-hour weeks by mid-career (and rightly so!). There’s a lot of hustle culture out there that promises to get you there right away; while a few folks out there get lucky, most of this is just concealing the outside-the-office time its purporters are plugging in. In hopes of making this wide range of possibilities a little easier to navigate (and with the wish that I could give myself this same resource some twenty years ago), here’s a breakdown of some common and reliable actual paths towards career satisfaction, particularly for those that are young and hungry:</description>

      <title>Password managers aren&amp;#39;t replacements for passkeys</title>
      <link>https://blog.millerti.me/2024/10/18/password-managers-arent-replacements-for-passkeys/</link>
      <description>There was some recent discourse about passkeys that bemoaned that they have so many issues that it’s better to stick with a password manager. The idea is that maintaining strong, unique passwords via a password manager is easier for users to understand.
This completely misses the key point about why passkeys are such a stronger way of protecting login, though, so I decided to spend some time to compare the two approaches.</description>

      <title>Why authorization architecture is probably fragile</title>
      <link>https://ennabah.com/authz</link>
      <description>We initially built our own authorization system in PostgreSQL, but as requirements grew more complex, we had to evolve toward a relation-based authorization service. We chose SpiceDB to handle advanced use cases like organizational hierarchies and temporary access. However, while solving many technical challenges, it also opened up new security risks, particularly around ensuring consistent and reliable enforcement of authorization decisions across applications.</description>
