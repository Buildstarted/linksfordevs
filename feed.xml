      <title>Insulation: first the body, then the home</title>
      <link>https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/02/body-insulation-thermal-underwear.html</link>
      <description>You could fill a library with reports and books describing the importance of energy-efficient heating systems and home insulation. However, not a word has been said or written about the energy savings potential of clothing, even though there has been a lot of progress in this area too. Modern thermal underclothing offers the possibility to turn the thermostat much lower without sacrificing comfort or sex appeal. The potential energy savings are huge; the costs are almost nil. This article explains through science and statistics how to maintain thermal comfort at any given indoor temperature using only clothes.

Over the last decades, both the insulation of homes...</description>

      <title>Top Articles I&amp;#39;ve Read in 2020</title>
      <link>https://bcmullins.github.io/top-articles-2020/</link>
      <description>Below are the top articles I’ve read in 2020. This year’s list contains a nice mix of types of articles. A prominent theme in the list is economics and economic methodology with A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas, Economic Modelling as Robustness Analysis, and Thoughts on DSGE Macroeconomics. The Theory of Interstellar Trade is an oddball article from a young Paul Krugman. An introduction to (algorithmic) randomness is an excellent invitation to a technical area of mathematical logic, and Comments on Economic Models, Economics, and Economists is a fun and effective book review on methodology. Finally, there’s four thought provoking articles across political rhetoric, machine learning privacy, social contract theory, and international relations with The Paranoid Style in American Politics, Stealing Machine Learning Models via Prediction APIs, Self-organizing moral systems, The End of Grand Strategy.

      <title>Major leak &amp;#39;exposes&amp;#39; members and &amp;#39;lifts the lid&amp;#39; on the Chinese Communist Party  | Sky News Australia</title>
      <link>https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6215946537001</link>
      <description>A major leak containing a register with the details of nearly two million CCP members has occurred – exposing members who are now working all over the world, while also lifting the lid on how the party operates under Xi Jinping, says Sharri Markson. 

Ms Markson said the leak is a register with the details of Communist Party members, including their names, party position, birthday, national ID number and ethnicity. 

“It is believed to be the first leak of its kind in the world,” the Sky News host said. 

“What&amp;#39;s amazing about this database is not just that it exposes people who are members of the communist party, and who are now living and working all over the world, from Australia to the US to the UK,” Ms Markson said. 

“But it&amp;#39;s amazing because it lifts the lid on how the party operates under President and Chairman Xi Jinping”. 

Ms Markson said the leak demonstrates party branches are embedded in some of the world’s biggest companies and even inside government agencies. 

“Communist party branches have been set up inside western companies, allowing the infiltration of those companies by CCP members - who, if called on, are answerable directly to the communist party, to the  Chairman, the president himself,” she said. 

“Along with the personal identifying details of 1.95 million communist party members, mostly from Shanghai, there are also the details of 79,000 communist party branches, many of them inside companies”. 

Ms Markson said the leak is a significant security breach likely to embarrass Xi Jinping. 

“It is also going to embarrass some global companies who appear to have no plan in place to protect their intellectual property from theft. From economic espionage,” she said. 

Ms Markson said the data was extracted from a Shanghai server by Chinese dissidents, whistleblowers, in April 2016, who have been using it for counter-intelligence purposes. 

“It was then leaked in mid-September to the newly-formed international bi-partisan group, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China - and that group is made up of 150 legislators around the world.

“It was then provided to an international consortium of four media organisations, The Australian, The Sunday Mail in the UK, De Standaard in Belgium and a Swedish editor, to analyse over the past two months, and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve done&amp;quot;. 

Ms Markson said it, “is worth noting that there&amp;#39;s no suggestion that these members have committed espionage - but the concern is over whether Australia or these companies knew of the CCP members and if so have any steps been taken to protect their data and people”.

 I was having a chat with a friend about what types of problems are good candidates for Mathematical Planning. He posed the question, “Would a Secret Santa exchange be a good candidate?” At first, I thought, “no.” As we kept chatting though, I changed my mind.</description>
