      <title>Using a &amp;quot;Proper&amp;quot; Camera as a Webcam</title>
      <link>https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2022/using_a_proper_camera_as_a_webcam.html</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s 2022, so many of us now have 2 years experience of online meetings.
My experience is that the better that I can see and
hear someone in an online call, the more natural the conversation feels. Put
another way, I think one does a courtesy to the other person by improving the
quality of how you appear in a video call.</description>

      <title>The impact of digital media on children’s intelligence while controlling for genetic differences in cognition and socioeconomic background - Scientific Reports</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11341-2</link>
      <description>Digital media defines modern childhood, but its cognitive effects are unclear and hotly debated. We believe that studies with genetic data could clarify causal claims and correct for the typically unaccounted role of genetic predispositions. Here, we estimated the impact of different types of screen time (watching, socializing, or gaming) on children’s intelligence while controlling for the confounding effects of genetic differences in cognition and socioeconomic status. We analyzed 9855 children from the USA who were part of the ABCD dataset with measures of intelligence at baseline (ages 9–10) and after two years. At baseline, time watching (r = −&amp;amp;nbsp;0.12) and socializing (r = −&amp;amp;nbsp;0.10) were negatively correlated with intelligence, while gaming did not correlate. After two years, gaming positively impacted intelligence (standardized β =  + 0.17), but socializing had no effect. This is consistent with cognitive benefits documented in experimental studies on video gaming. Unexpectedly, watching videos also benefited intelligence (standardized β =  + 0.12), contrary to prior research on the effect of watching TV. Although, in a posthoc analysis, this was not significant if parental education (instead of SES) was controlled for. Broadly, our results are in line with research on the malleability of cognitive abilities from environmental factors, such as cognitive training and the Flynn effect.</description>

      <title>Dolphin Progress Report: February, March, and April 2022</title>
      <link>https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2022/05/17/dolphin-progress-report-february-march-and-april-2022/</link>
      <description>After a long wait, the Progress Report is back! This time it wasn&amp;#39;t so much from a lack of content, but from a lack of content creators. The past three months had illnesses hit one of our writers and the other had a very challenging move. Even with these major hurdles jumped, we&amp;#39;re not even close to 100% yet. It&amp;#39;s been a battle to get caught up with all of the big changes to Dolphin the past couple of months and because of that this report is a tad late.
Needless to say, there&amp;#39;s only one way to start catching up, and that&amp;#39;s to get to digging through the past three months of Notable Changes. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>I love flags. The power of a piece of cloth to motivate people to fight, revere, or weep is inherently interesting. Flag design is also a constrained optimisation problem: how do you trade off symb…</description>

      <title>Remembering Buildtool - Julio Merino (jmmv.dev)</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/05/remembering-buildtool.html</link>
      <description>Build systems are one of my favorite topics in software engineering. If I recall correctly, my interest in this area started when I got into NetBSD in 2002&amp;amp;mdash;20 years ago&amp;amp;mdash;and became a pkgsrc contributor. Packaging software for NetBSD made me fight various build systems and, in particular, experience the pains of debugging the GNU Autotools.
Around that same time, I was also writing small tools here and there. Out of inertia, I used the GNU Autotools for these and, the more I used them, the more I saw an opportunity for improvement.</description>
