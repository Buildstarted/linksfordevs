      <title>Building a GPS Receiver, Part 1: Hearing Whispers</title>
      <link>https://axleos.com/building-a-gps-receiver-part-1-hearing-whispers/</link>
      <description>Have you ever noticed that your Maps app still works during a flight? It can feel illicit, like someone just forgot to turn off the signal, and that watching yourself crawl along the earth should be done without drawing undue attention. A few months ago I learned that there were only around 30 GPS satellites serving the entire planet. This piqued my interest, because it reminded me of the 13 root DNS servers from which all resolution flows. Perhaps GPS has a similar design in which the ‘source of truth’ is diluted by several layers of signal repeaters? I navigated to gps.gov, and was presented with this delightful image. I became even more excited to learn about what these satellites do!</description>

      <title>Make it easy for me to review your code</title>
      <link>https://gaurangtandon.com/blog/easy-code-review</link>
      <description>Almost every software engineer - irrespective of their tech stack - writes code collaboratively via Git. They submit their fixes or features as changesets. One of their colleagues then reviews the changeset and approves or rejects it. This reviewer must approve your changeset before it can be merged and deployed.</description>

Some are brilliant. And, almost always, most would have made more money and had a more profitable career if they had simply stopped stealing and starting working honestly.</description>
