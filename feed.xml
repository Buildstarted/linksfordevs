      <title>What to learn</title>
      <link>https://danluu.com/learn-what/</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s common to see people advocate for learning skills that they have or using processes that they use. For example, Steve Yegge has a set of blog posts where he recommends reading compiler books and learning about compilers. His reasoning is basically that, if you understand compilers, you&amp;#39;ll see compiler problems everywhere and will recognize all of the cases where people are solving a compiler problem without using compiler knowledge. Instead of hacking together some half-baked solution that will never work, you can apply a bit of computer science knowledge to solve the problem in a better way with less effort. That&amp;#39;s not untrue, but it&amp;#39;s also not a reason to study compilers in particular because you can say that about many different areas of computer science and math. Queuing theory, computer architecture, mathematical optimization, operations research, etc.</description>

      <title>My indoor rowing tips after 15 million meters</title>
      <link>https://onlyrss.org/posts/my-rowing-tips-after-15-million-meters.html</link>
      <description>I bought my Concept 2 Model C
                    rower
                    in 2001, my plan (like most people who buy exercise equipment) was to use it every week. And, like
                    most
                    people, I failed. I used the rower sporadically for a while, and then I moved house, and it just sat
                    there in my new home, gathering dust. I&amp;#39;d get the urge to start using it again (yes...January) and
                    as usual, it didn&amp;#39;t last. I&amp;#39;ve always done some form of exercise, either in the gym or running,
                    and have had some long periods of running every week, but I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever exercised
                    consistently every week for a period longer than a year.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I got to wondering - if my work dried up and I had to minimize my expenses, how long could I last on savings? Or, if work continued and I minimized expenses anyway, how little would I have to work to break even?</description>
