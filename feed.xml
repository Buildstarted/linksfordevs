      <link>http://feed.azuredevops.show/philip-japikse-professional-c-in-net-episode-230</link>
      <description>An international speaker, Microsoft MVP, ASPInsider, MCSD, PSM II, PSD, and PST, and a passionate member of the developer community, Phil has been working with .NET since the first betas, developing software for over 35 years, and heavily involved in the agile community since 2005 as well as a Professional Scrum Trainer.

Phil always enjoys learning new tech and is always striving to improve his craft. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [2:22] What were the key points that steered Philip along his career and watershed moments? [6:42] The importance of having a contract in place for every job. [8:14] Philip talks about honing his craft and putting himself in rooms with people he admired. [11:01] What did the Library of Congress have to do with Philip’s book? [18:00] As the CTO of a private company, what does Philip think about the software executive role? [19:33] Don’t ask your employees to do anything they’re not willing to do for you. Trust your employees and let them grow. [24:11] The best leaders don’t have to be in management. [24:53] What is an NCO, non-commissioned officer? [27:15] Phil shares his view on object-oriented programming in the modern C#. [32:19] What is technical debt?

      <title>Rule of Four</title>
      <link>https://andrew-quinn.me/rule-of-four/</link>
      <description>A communication heuristic, optimized for asynchronous communication of detailed concepts between human beings.
Rationale Existence “proof”  Our short term memory can hold at best about 7 +/- 2 chunks of information at a time. Start with the lower end of that: 5 chunks. Assume that whatever someone is “really” trying to do takes up 1 of those 5. We’re left with 4 chunks.  Conclusion Organize your work processes as much as possible so that they can be effectively understood using at most 4 chunks of short-term memory.</description>

      <description>While in Lisbon at the end of 2022 I heard about the Filecoin Saturn launch and thought this was a pretty cool idea to create an on-chain CDN on-top of IPFS. The idea intrigued me to go through the process to setup a node. My setup notes were pretty involved so I figured I&amp;#39;d share it with community.</description>

      <description>Multi-tenancy is a software architecture pattern where a single instance of a software application is used by multiple customers, with each customer having separate and isolated data, configurations, and resources. RavenDB is a NoSQL document database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for multi-tenant applications. This blog post will explore why multi-tenancy exists, the advantages of using RavenDB for multi-tenant applications, and provide code examples to get you started.
