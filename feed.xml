      <title>.NET Rocks! The Inflection Point of Large Language Models with Grant Barrett</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1836</link>
      <description>ChatGPT, BingAI, and Google Bard are the latest examples of large language model machine learning - are we at an inflection point in technology? Carl and Richard talk to Grant Barrett of A Way with Words about the power of these new technologies to solicit reactions from many folks, including many tech journalists. Grant talks about how language conveys a sense of intelligence even when there is none to be had and the problems created by those assumptions. It is still the early days for these chatbots - will they rapidly improve or fade into another AI winter?</description>

      <title>What I Learnt From SICP</title>
      <link>https://kaustubh.page/posts/what-i-learnt-from-sicp/</link>
      <description>I had started with SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) some time early last year. I had read through one and a half chapters and then stopped because it felt too mathematical and I didn’t know what I was getting from it. Then later that year, I attended Lambda Retreat, conducted by Anand, who is my colleague and has found SICP to be quite profound himself.
It changed the way I think about programs, added new perspective, and got me interested in the design and implementation of programming languages.</description>

      <description>One of the first jobs I had gave me the opportunity to work with James King, and one of the great habits I picked up from him was making sure to set aside time to learn from others. He would set aside an hour or so a day, sometimes less, sometimes more, to read through the RSS feeds he had subscribed to in Google Reader (RIP), and he encouraged me to always do the same.</description>

      <description>A common trope is how, if one wants to build a game, one should build a game, rather than a game engine, because it is all too easy to fall into a trap of building a generic solution, without getting to the game proper.
It seems to me that the situation with code editors is the opposite --- many people build editors, but few are building editor engines.
What&amp;#39;s an editor engine? A made up term I use to denote a thin waist the editor is build upon, the set of core concepts, entities and APIs which power the variety of editor&amp;#39;s components.
In this post, I will highlight Emacs&amp;#39; thin waist, which I think is worthy of imitation!</description>

      <description>In recent months and years, there was a certain hype around benchmarking, also in the .NET community.
This blog post is meant to ground some of the benchmarking topics and put this into relation to other things so you get a better understanding if it&amp;#39;s worth the effort.
