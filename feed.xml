      <title>The One Where I Lie To The CTO</title>
      <link>https://grumpyolddev.com/post/the-one-where-i-lie-to-the-cto/</link>
      <description>This was several years back. Keep in mind that early in my career, my father had told me that doing a good job often meant doing what needed to be done in spite of your boss. And by that he meant that you can either make your boss successful and happy or you can run every decision by your boss. In which case no one is successful or happy.
I was working at the time for a Fortune 500 company and our CTO had signed up to deliver a big project for an important client with whom he had personal connections.</description>

      <title>Consistency Large Language Models: A Family of Efficient Parallel Decoders</title>
      <link>https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/blogs/cllm/</link>
      <description>TL;DR: LLMs have been traditionally regarded as sequential decoders, decoding one token after another. In this blog, we show pretrained LLMs can be easily taught to operate as efficient parallel decoders. We introduce Consistency Large Language Models (CLLMs), a new family of parallel decoders capable of reducing inference latency by efficiently decoding an $n$-token sequence per inference step. Our research shows this process – mimicking human cognitive process of forming complete sentences in mind before articulating word by word – can be effectively learned by simply finetuning pretrained LLMs.</description>

      <description>Would that we all know what we want. Or at least what we don&amp;#39;t.

People who tell others to learn to code pile implicit assumptions into the statement.

Learn to code...

...to fix your tools.

...to make your own tools.

...for fun.

...for freedom!

...for money!

...to understand your computer!</description>

      <title>Canada’s most important Canadian thinker – Daniel Frank</title>
      <link>https://danfrank.ca/my-favourite-joseph-heath-articles-canadas-most-important-canadian-thinker/</link>
      <description>There are a lot of Canadian superstars. In the world of ideas, there are individuals like Philip Tetlock, Steven Pinker, Alex Tabarrok, and David Card. But like most Canadian superstars, these people became recognized in the context of working in the United States, and speaking about American or global issues. In contrast, Joseph Heath is a Canadian superstar, who works in Canada and primarily publishes in the Canadian context. Heath is as sharp as any thinker in the US and merits my strongest endorsement.</description>

      <title>Naming Things is Hard (Game Genre Edition)</title>
      <link>https://anderegg.ca/2024/05/08/naming-things-is-hard-game-genre-edition</link>
      <description>Stuart Brown (aka Ahoy) 1 released What genre is DOOM? on YouTube recently. It’s a great video and I recommend checking it out. His point seems mostly tongue-in-cheek, but about halfway through the video I thought he was going in a completely different direction. Originally “XboxAhoy”, I’ve been watching Brown’s stuff since 2012 after finding his Call of Duty: Black Ops II weapon guide series. His videos were exceptionally well produced, especially relative to 2012 YouTube quality, and he’s only improved over time. Check out FLATLINE: How The Amiga Languished for another great example of his work.&amp;#160;↩</description>

      <title>Broken Promises: The Nix Governance Discussions</title>
      <link>https://shealevy.com/blog/2024/05/08/broken-promises-the-nix-governance-discussions/</link>
      <description>This post presupposes some level of familiarity with the ongoing work to establish new governance in the Nix project. If you don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s been going on, this is almost certainly not interesting to you.


Summary: I have been unjustly suspended from the NixOS governance discussion. The manner and rationale of the suspension reveals corruption of the promised objective process, and the fact of the suspension deprives the project of valuable contributions. Everyone should accept that the NixOS Foundation Board has made its decision that certain positions are not up for discussion, and either engage on their (actual, not promised) terms or part ways.</description>
