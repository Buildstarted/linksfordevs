      <title>How I Growth Hacked Instagram to Drive $13,000 of Card Game Sales - David Kemmerer</title>
      <link>https://davidkemmerer.co/growth-hacking-instagram/</link>
      <description>In 2017 I launched a College and University themed version of the game Cards Against Humanity. College Cards, as I dubbed it, was my first ever ‘official business’, and as a 22 year old recent college grad, I was pretty excited when I sold $13,000 of the game to University of Wisconsin students just 45 days after launch.</description>

      <title>Goodbye NancyFX, Hello F#!</title>
      <link>https://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2020-06-16-goodbye-nancyfx-hello-fsharp/</link>
      <description>As some of you may already know, NancyFX has been archived 11 years after its first commit.  You can read the announcement here for further information but I will never forget what I learnt from this codebase, the community around it and most especially the people involved with it.  I am very proud and honoured to have been involved with it and a massive thank you to Andreas Håkansson for teaching me plenty via the 1:1 Skype calls we had in the early days.  As many of you also know I created Carter which in my mind was Nancy v2 but sat on top of ASP.NET Core with the same approaches as Nancy, offering many things a web framework should have.  The usage of Carter has steadily increased which is good to know people value similar things we achieved with Nancy.  However, paradoxically I have had a feeling brewing for sometime that this effort is almost futile.</description>
