      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/04/always-be-quitting.html</link>
      <description>A good philosophy to live by at work is to &amp;amp;ldquo;always be quitting&amp;amp;rdquo;. No, don&amp;amp;rsquo;t be constantly thinking of leaving your job &amp;#128561;. But act as if you might leave on short notice &amp;#128526;. Counterintuitively, this will make you a better engineer and open up growth opportunities. A thread &amp;#128071;.

      <link>https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/2021-06-08-certificate-lifetime-incident-valid-for-an-extra-one-second/153426</link>
      <description>Let’s Encrypt is well-known for issuing certificates that are valid for only 90 days. Since the very first certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt’s infrastructure, those certificates have been given a 90 day validity period by our CA software by taking the issuance time and adding exactly 2,160 hours to yield the certificate’s “not after” date. However, RFC 5280 defines the validity period of a certificate as being the duration between the “not before” and the “not after” timestamps, inclusive. Th...</description>

      <title>ALPACA Attack</title>

      <description>TLS is an internet standard to secure the communication
      between servers and clients on the internet, for example
      that of web servers, FTP servers, and Email servers. This
      is possible because TLS was designed to be application
      layer independent, which allows its use in many diverse
      communication protocols.</description>

      <title>Engineering a chess match against my brother</title>
      <link>https://blog.mbrt.dev/posts/chess-eng/</link>
      <description>This is the story of me trying to win a game of chess against my brother. A single freaking game. What’s so special about it? Am I good at chess? Not at all. Did I improve at my game in the process? Also no. Is it a story about “the journey rather than the destination”? Not really. Did I at least have fun in the process? Not so sure. This is the story of me trying to be unconventional at probably the most studied game in existence and using my software engineering background for something that probably doesn’t need it.</description>
