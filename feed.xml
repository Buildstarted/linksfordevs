      <title>Jujutsu: A Haven for Mercurial Users at Mozilla</title>
      <link>https://ahal.ca/blog/2024/jujutsu-mercurial-haven/</link>
      <description>One of the pleasures of working at Mozilla, has been learning and using the
Mercurial version control system. Over the past decade, I’ve spent countless
hours tinkering my worfklow to be just so. Reading docs and articles,
meticulously tweaking settings and even writing an extension.
I used to be very passionate about Mercurial. But as time went on, the
culture at Mozilla started changing. More and more repos were created in
Github, and more and more developers started using git-cinnabar to work on
mozilla-central. Then my role changed and I found that 90% of my work was
happening outside of mozilla-central and the Mercurial garden I had created
for myself.
So it was with a sense of resigned inevitability that I took the news that
Mozilla would be migrating mozilla-central to Git. The fire in me was all but
extinguished, I was resigned to my fate. And what’s more, I had to agree. The
time had come for Mozilla to officially make the switch.
Glandium wrote an excellent post outlining some of the history of the
decisions made around version control, putting them into the context of the
time. In that post, he offers some compelling wisdom to Mercurial holdouts like
myself:

I’ll swim against the current here, and say this: the earlier you can switch
to git, the earlier you’ll find out what works and what doesn’t work for you,
whether you already know Git or not.

When I read that, I had to agree. But, I just couldn’t bring myself to do it.
No, if I was going to have to give up my revsets and changeset obsolesence and
my carefully curated workflows, then so be it. But damnit! I was going to
continue using them for as long as possible.
And I’m glad I didn’t switch because then I stumbled upon Jujutsu.</description>

      <title>Deanna Dikeman - Leaving and Waving</title>
      <link>https://deannadikeman.com/leaving-and-waving</link>
      <description>For 27 years, I took photographs as I waved good-bye and drove away from visiting my parents at their home in Sioux City, Iowa. I started in 1991 with a quick snapshot, and I continued taking photographs with each departure. I never set out to make this series. I just took these photographs as a way to deal with the sadness of leaving. It gradually turned into our good-bye ritual. And it seemed natural to keep the camera busy, because I had been taking pictures every day while I was there. These photographs are part of a larger body of work I call Relative Moments, which has chronicled the lives of my parents and other relatives since 1986. When I discovered the series of accumulated “leaving and waving” photographs, I found a story about family, aging, and the sorrow of saying good-bye.

In 2009, there is a photograph where my father is no longer there. He passed away a few days after his 91st birthday. My mother continued to wave good-bye to me. Her face became more forlorn with my departures. In 2017, my mother had to move to assisted living. For a few months, I photographed the good-byes from her apartment door. In October of 2017 she passed away. When I left after her funeral, I took one more photograph, of the empty driveway. For the first time in my life, no one was waving back at me. </description>

      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=fNDdOntkIeI</link>
      <description>If you&amp;#39;re familiar with ASP NET Core, then you&amp;#39;re likely familiar with using appsettings.json files for your applications.

But... What happens if you want to use a console application and have the same type of configuration?

No sweat!

We can enable this functionality with ease -- only a few lines of code!
