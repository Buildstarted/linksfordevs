      <title>Plan 9 Desktop Guide</title>
      <link>https://pspodcasting.net/dan/blog/2019/plan9_desktop.html#intro</link>
      <description>Briefly,
            Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a computer operating system designed by the original UNIX design team,
            after decades of work on Research UNIX in the late 80&amp;#39;s,
            the team decided to write a new operating system from scratch,
            Plan 9 was finally released in 1992,
            and a few years later they released yet another operating system called
            Inferno,
            which share many of the same characteristics as its sister project.
            These systems,
            and variations thereof,
            have more or less been in continual development since.
            The history and design philosophy behind these operating systems,
            is interesting,
            but we will not talk about that here.
            Instead,
            this article will focus on the practical aspects of using Plan 9 as day-to-day desktop system.</description>

      <title>Open Source Tax Software | Connor Skennerton</title>
      <link>http://ctskennerton.github.io/2021/08/30/open-source-tax-software/</link>
      <description>Filing taxes in America sucks. Your options are to do it by hand, pay someone like Intuit, or if you are below a certain income threshold get some tax software for free. The kicker is that free tax software is from Intuit who will try very hard to make sure that you either don’t find it in the first place, or try to get you to pay for it and upsell you on something that should be free.</description>

      <title>Implicit Overflow Considered Harmful (and how to fix it)</title>
      <link>https://blog.polybdenum.com/2021/10/03/implicit-overflow-considered-harmful-and-how-to-fix-it.html</link>
      <description>A common problem in programming language design is the question of what the type of integral literals should be, and if they are untyped, what the rules for implicitly converting them to regular integer types should be. This is part of the more general problem of how to handle having multiple integer types with overflow and the conversions between them. There are many approaches to this problem, but they all have significant downsides.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty, Mental Shortcuts, and Errors in Technology Decisions</title>
      <link>https://parijatmishra.github.io/2021/10/03/decisions-uncertainty-heuristics.html</link>
      <description>If you are a technology leader, you know you make decisions, big or small, all the time. You also know that each decision carries some risk. Risks arise from several sources. We know how to mitigate many of the sources, but one of them is insidious: uncertainty due to lack of information. Behavioral phychologists and economists have spent decades researching how humans make decisions under uncertainty, and have found that a very wide variety of errors in decisions arise due to a few—just three, in fact—mental shortcuts humans use on a daily basis. These shortcuts, while useful in some circumstances, create systematic and even predictable errors. Sadly, we are largely unaware we are using them. In this article I will discuss what we know about how humans deal with uncertainty intuitively, the kinds of errors this can create, and how to identify and stop the mental shortcuts that can lead us to make errors. I hope this will help you increase the quality of your decisions and reduce risk, with only a little effort.</description>
