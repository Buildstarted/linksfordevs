      <title>Because I am bored ...</title>
      <link>https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2021/05/because-i-am-bored.html</link>
      <description>While Bitcoin was originally proposed as a currency, it has most of the attributes of a commodity bubble, including a huge halo of swindlers and scam artists working to exploit it. It&amp;#39;s also horribly energy-inefficient and contributes to the current global semiconductor shortage, neither of which are desirable. Even worse: attempts at fixing Bitcoin mostly revolve around tweaking the &amp;quot;proof of work&amp;quot; required to add a transaction to the blockchain. Currently, BtC and relatives are computation-intensive. Other paradigms exist, including the new fad for Chiacoin, currently big in China, which is storage intensive — this is what happens when the designer of Bittorrent brings his own personal obsessions to bear on the problem of manufacturing scarcity, and if you want to upgrade your SSD or hard drive in the near future you&amp;#39;d better get right to it before this catches on.</description>

      <description>A customer had a shell namespace extension and discovered that when the user dragged an item, their custom drop target gets Drag&amp;#173;Enter and Drag&amp;#173;Leave method calls as expected, but the Drag&amp;#173;Over method calls are being throttled. Specifically, they get a new Drag&amp;#173;Over call only if the keyboard modifier state changes.</description>

      <title>Why load balancing gRPC is tricky?</title>
      <link>https://majidfn.com/blog/20201222-grpc-load-balancing/</link>
