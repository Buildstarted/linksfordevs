      <link>https://joel.sna.pe/b/homepod-temp-humidity-coming-soon.html</link>
      <description>TLDR: Apple has added some extra request IDs to the Companion-Link protocol that&amp;#39;s used to talk between Apple devices and the HomePod Mini. These keys show that it&amp;#39;s possible to check whether temperature and humidity measuring is enabled, and fetch readings if it is. I&amp;#39;m working on reverse engineering the protocol, plan to publish more soon, and this would be great to get into something like HomeAssistant.</description>

      <title>Abstract Syntax Tree for Patching Code and Assessing Code Quality</title>
      <link>https://engineering.soroco.com/abstract-syntax-tree-for-patching-code-and-assessing-code-quality/</link>
      <description>Abstract Syntax Tree is an extremely useful tool. It provides a tree representation of a source code, that can be traversed to parse the code while understanding the code’s language constructs. In this article, we explain how we have used ASTs to write IntelliPatch scripts that can...</description>

      <title>Dolphin Emulator</title>
      <link>https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2021/06/06/dolphin-progress-report-april-and-may-2021/</link>
      <description>After finishing up the macOS M1 article the blog staff took a little break. Then they saw the date.

Upon looking at the actual changelog, however, something became readily apparent: this wasn&amp;#39;t going to be just a progress report; this was going to be a MEGA Progress Report. The long rumored time era of developers merging everything at once had finally come to pass. We have graphical fixes for Super Mario Galaxy and Luigi&amp;#39;s Mansion, crash fixes for Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III, Xenoblade Chronicles, Ultimate Spider-Man, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (AArch64), and new features that make playing games more pleasant! And about AArch64, there are a litany of optimizations and fixes that will change things across most of the library.

And we could go on: Bounding Box, Interpreter, GBA to GCN connectivity, GPU Syncing, Mouse Locking, and still more! There&amp;#39;s even a lengthy dev diary at the end for good measure explaining how the great mystery of Pokemon Box&amp;#39;s was finally solved. The only way to do it justice is to do it right. So buckle up and get ready for the April and May MEGA Progress Report.</description>

      <title>RISC vs. CISC Is the Wrong Lens for Comparing Modern x86, ARM CPUs - ExtremeTech</title>
      <link>https://www.extremetech.com/computing/323245-risc-vs-cisc-why-its-the-wrong-lens-to-compare-modern-x86-arm-cpus</link>
      <description>Try to investigate the differences between the x86 and ARM processor families (or x86 and the Apple M1), and you&amp;#39;ll see the acronyms CISC and RISC. It&amp;#39;s a common way to frame the discussion, but not a very useful one. Today, &amp;quot;RISC versus CISC&amp;quot; obscures more than it explains.</description>

      <description>An Oceana analysis found hundreds of foreign fishing vessels, primarily Chinese, pillaging the waters off Argentina and disappearing from public tracking systems. These distant-water fleets mainly fish for shortfin squid, which are vital to Argentina’s economy and the diet of numerous commercial and recreational species, such as tuna and swordfish.</description>
