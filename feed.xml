      <title>Wiki - PinebookProSixMonthsIn</title>
      <link>https://wiki.alopex.li/PinebookProSixMonthsIn</link>
      <description>There’s been a lot of excited reviews among the more nerdly segments of society about the Pinebook Pro, a 14-inch, $200 Linux laptop using an ARM CPU and generally open-source hardware. Rumors are it’s extremely solid for a piece of hardware that’s far below the “bargain” price range and into the “fell off the back of a truck” pile. However, I recently read someone complaining that there’s been lots of “fresh new user” blog posts and no “how does this actually work six months in” write-ups. It just so happens that I’ve had my Pinebook Pro as my main laptop for nearly six months now, so I thought I’d write up my experiences with it so far.</description>

      <title>How We Solved the Worst Minigame in Zelda's History</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1hs451PfFzQ</link>
      <description>Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/linkus7/

After Years of having to deal with Sploosh Kaboom, the Battleship Minigame in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, we have finally found a way to beat it consistently. This is the result of many people's efforts to Reverse Engineer Wind Waker and craft a program that can take advantage of its structure.

This video would have not been possible without Peter Schmidt-Nielsen.
All the Animations in this video were created by Peter in Javascript using d3, so huge shout out to him for putting in such great work!

      <description>A few years ago I wrote about how I'd been playing a  simplified version of Carcassonne with Lily. We stopped for a while, but recently we've played simplified versions of Ticket to Ride, Race for the Galaxy, Guillotine, and Settlers of Catan. My general approach here is to find a core piece of the game that will be fun on its own, and then add to it as Lily wants more complexity.  While the parti</description>

      <title>The danger of async/await and .Result in one picture – TooSlowException</title>
      <link>https://tooslowexception.com/the-danger-of-asyncawait-and-result-in-one-picture/</link>
      <description>Sync over async in .NET is always bad and there is no better advice than just to avoid it. What does “Sync over async” mean exactly? It happens if you synchronously wait on an asynchronous operation result with the help of .Result, .Wait or similar. Why is it bad? First of all, it blocks (wastes) one thread to wait on a result – which may lead to threads starvation. But even worse, it may deadlock your operation and (sometimes) the whole application.</description>

      <title>As Qualified Immunity Takes Center Stage, More Delay from SCOTUS</title>
      <link>https://www.unlawfulshield.com/2020/06/as-qualified-immunity-takes-center-stage-more-delay-from-scotus/</link>
      <description>I fear I may have become trapped in a time loop, in which every week I am doomed to write the same blog post about how the Supreme Court has delayed consideration of its qualified immunity docket. Back in April, I noted that the Court had scheduled thirteen different qualified immunity cases for its May 15th conference, including three cases explicitly calling for the Court to reconsider the doctrine entirely. Many of these petitions had already been fully briefed and ready for consideration since last October. But the Court then rescheduled the bulk of those cases again, and again, and again.</description>

Or you can use VS Code or Visual Studio (available soon) on your local machine and connect that to Visual Studio Codespaces. This is a great way to develop a resource-intensive application on a simple device. You run VS Code on a laptop without much power and Visual Studio Codespaces does the heavy lifting in he cloud.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Microsoft.FeatureManagement library</title>
      <link>https://daveabrock.com/2020/05/26/introducing-feature-management-copy.html</link>
      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I needed to find a way to better manage new functionality for a feature that was not ready yet (it broke stuff). We didn’t know exactly when the feature would be shipped, but we also didn’t want to deal with branch and merging headaches when the moment came. My first thought: this was a perfect candidate for feature flags (or feature toggles). This allows you to merge code into a production branch, but only enable when ready. Instead of waiting for developers to be ready, you’re waiting for the end user to be ready.</description>
