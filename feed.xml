      <title>Healthspan Blog | Zone 2 Endurance Training and Its Relationship With Longevity, Cardiovascular, and Musculoskeletal Health</title>
      <link>https://gethealthspan.com/blog/articles/zone-2-endurance-training-longevity-cardiovascular-musculoskeletal-health/5uqofwkeo2qeq8th3lm4n7/</link>
      <description>For a decade, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has dominated the fitness world, thanks to its touted ability to enhance health and performance. Recent advances have begun to explore the impact of much slower endurance-based training on metabolic health and potentially longevity. We will deep dive into this training practice to discuss how to incorporate this into your daily life and what&amp;#39;s going on at the cellular, molecular &amp;amp; whole-body level when you train in zone 2 &amp;amp; 5. Lastly, we&amp;#39;ll look at how these training modalities impact longevity, reduced risk of all-cause mortality, and the benefits of maintaining endurance exercise your entire life.  </description>

      <title>Architect your project with Framed: effortless files and directories management</title>
      <link>https://blog.mactat.dev/posts/framed/</link>
      <description>Framed is a CLI tool that simplifies the organization and management of files and directories in a reusable and architectural manner. It provides YAML templates for defining project structures and enables workflows based on those. To always be in sync with the YAML template, Framed provides a built-in test command that can be used in CI/CD pipelines to verify the project structure. It was just a project to learn some golang, but i think that the idea is quite nice. Let me know what do you think.</description>

      <title>On The Minimalist Entrepreneur book</title>
      <link>https://efe.me/2023/06/on-the-minimal-entrepreneur-book</link>
      <description>I’m always coming up with side project ideas. As a product-minded developer, I strive to understand the flow of everyday applications and generate new ideas. I envision prototypes in my mind, create their basic flow, and even purchase domains for them. However, I have never successfully turned any of these side projects into revenue-generating ventures. Consequently, they all end up languishing in my “side-projects list”.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Illusion of Sentience in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://aarushgupta.com/blog/2023/05/18/illusion-of-sentience.html</link>
      <description>After the release of the seminal film The Terminator (1984), the most prominent question in advancements in artificial intelligence was whether our future would be met with a Skynet-esque doom. An astonishing and unbelievable 39 years later, the looming question is approaching reality. Companies, organizations, and individuals now have the power to interact, create, and integrate these models into their daily lives. With every conversation with the models, the notions generated and the flow of words make it increasingly apparent – the models we considered toys with the release of the Transformer architecture have surpassed the earlier realization. They exhibit a remarkable ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, a trait that used to be the standard of what it meant to be human. Simply put, the argument that only humans can comprehend and respond against the notion of a robot uprising has been rendered null.</description>
