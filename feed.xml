      <title>Alexander Sieradzki - Lights out solver or story about how to solve N^2 equations in O(N^3) time</title>
      <link>https://alexander.sieradzki.dev/posts/Lights_out_blogpost/</link>
      <description>Did you ever need to wake up at 5 am to go to the morning lecture where you are fighting for your life to stay awake and learn anything? Well, I know I did and it was a time when I kept myself focused by playing some logic games in the background. You know logic games like Minesweeper, simple games that once you learn you can solve absentmindedly. One game I kept thinking about over and over is Flip(which is an implementation of “Lights Out”). Computers solve this game by just solving a system of linear equations, but I wanted to find a method that 5 am me could absentmindedly use. Well, I didn’t find it but I found a way to solve that specific system of equations with much fewer operations. And that different way of solving it is the topic of this blog post.</description>

      <title>Booting the RP2350 from UART</title>
      <link>https://pfister.dev/blog/2025/rp2350-uart-bl.html</link>
      <description>The RP2350 is a nice microcontroller from Raspberry Pi. Recently I thougt about a new project, where a lot of PWM channels would be needed. The RP2350B has 24 PWM channels, which is a lot - but not enough. I would need at least 33 PWM channels, and also some more GPIOs, so the RP2350 alone isn't enough. So I thought about a port expander... But what about using a second RP2350 as a port expander?</description>

      <title>Quick thoughts on evaluating agents</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2025/02/27/short-note-evaluating-agents</link>
      <description>I recently encountered some companies which are in the due diligence and report generation space. They all use a multitude of AI agents to plan and do the research and this made me wonder how these agent stacks are evaluated.</description>

      <title>How modern databases keep their cool</title>
      <link>https://blog.canoozie.net/how-modern-databases-keep-their-cool/</link>
      <description>So I've been thinking a lot about database internals the past few weeks. For instance, how do these things actually work under the hood? I mean, we're all writing code that hammers these poor databases with concurrent requests, and somehow they don't explode into a million conflicting pieces. Pretty wild,</description>

      <description>I build tools to fix my own life — then write about the code, the crashes, and what actually worked.
No growth hacks. No platitudes. Just experiments, LLMs, and digital duct tape.</description>

      <title>Fitting models from noisy heuristic labels - Emir's blog</title>
      <link>https://emiruz.com/post/2025-05-11-soft-labels/</link>
      <description>I present a weak supervision paradigm called “data programming” which uses
maximum likelihood estimation to produce soft labels from heuristics. These
soft labels can then be used to train other models, without true labels
being required at any stage. I’ve included a simple example from first
principles to show that the methods work. The original authors have a fully
featured package called Snorkel which
provides sophisticated data programming and related features.</description>

      <title>Chris Henson - Beginner Resources for Formalizing Lambda Calculi</title>
      <link>https://chrishenson.net/posts/2025-05-10-formalized_lambda_calculus.html</link>
      <description>This started as a Twiter reply to @slimjimmy_dev
asking for some resources to help understand my Lean formalization of the
untyped lambda calculusNow that the groundwork is laid I should be able tackle the
categorical semantics of the untyped lambda calculus in Lean next! I claim
no originality for the confluence/progress pieces, they are an amalgamation
of the resources listed in this article., but quickly grew long enough that I decided to
make it into a post. Formalizing metatheory is a topic that is interesting to
beginner and experienced proof assistant users alike, but rife with tricky
technical issues that can dissuade one from making much progress. I hope by
collecting some resources here that I can provide a bit of help to those looking
for where to get started.</description>

      <title>15 Years of Shader Minification - Ctrl-Alt-Test</title>
      <link>https://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/2025/15-years-of-shader-minification/</link>
      <description>How do demosceners create complex computer animations in just a few kilobytes? One of our secret weapons is Shader Minifier, a tool that minifies GLSL code. Over the years, it has evolved to pack more data into tiny executables, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. In this blog post, we'll go through its evolution.</description>
