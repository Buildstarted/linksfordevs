      <link>https://davidyat.es/2022/08/31/stable-diffusion/</link>
      <description>On the 22nd of this month, Stability.ai released Stable Diffusion, a free, open-source AI tool for generating images from text prompts (and other images). Previously, access to this technology was available through Open AI’s commercial, invite-only DALL-E 2 platform, Midjourney’s commercial Discord bot, and, in a significantly reduced free-to-use form, Craiyon/DALL-E Mini. Basically, you had to use a hosted service and pay per image, or use something too simple to be much user for anything more than amusing jokes to post on social media.</description>

      <title>On Security Against Time Traveling Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1148</link>
      <description>If you had a time machine, what cryptography would you be able to break?

In this work, we investigate the notion of time travel, formally defining models for adversaries equipped with a time machine, and exploring the consequences for cryptography. We find that being able to rewind time breaks some cryptographic schemes, and being able to freely move both forwards and backwards in time breaks even more schemes.

We look at the impacts of time travel on encryption and signatures in particular, finding that the  and  security games are broken, while  and  remain secure.</description>

      <description>Mathias Brandewinder enjoys solving challenging business problems with software engineering and applied mathematics techniques, and some creativity. His current focus is on functional programming with F#, machine learning, and data science, and on putting them together to help companies make smarter decisions with their data. He loves teaching and mentoring, and is a regular speaker at conferences and community events all over the world. A former Microsoft F# MVP, he holds an MS in Operations Research from Stanford, an MS in Economics from University of Paris X, and an MBA from ESSEC. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [3:15] Mathias talks about how his love of math got him into programming. [5:57] Mathias discusses what intrigued him about F# and the scripting environment. [6:29] What about when a computer’s version of a number doesn’t really line up with the math version of a number? [11:51] What issues does F# help more than C#? [15:22] What is Mathias’s favorite charting component for .NET? [18:27] What inspired Mathias to write his book, , and is there a new book on the horizon? [20:09] Mathias is here to say math can be genuinely fun! [24:03] Jupiter appears to be an on-the-fly evaluator of code that runs on a server somewhere through the browser. [29:13] What other math-related libraries should we be aware of, and what are some other resources we can check out? &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  — New video podcast!
