      <title>A new wave of analyzers in .NET8</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/1a03a998-e428-4a42-9c30-1cfbf6ac5f4c</link>
      <description>Analyzers did become an integral part of the .NET ecosystem. Their main responsibility is to find potential code issues and warn you. Often times this comes even with potential fixes you can directly apply.
And Microsoft will continue this journey with the upcoming .NET 8 release. This blog post will show you potential candidates, which will make the cut.

      <title>Episode 46: Vim - with Joseph Woodward</title>
      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0046-vim/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I was joined again by Joseph Woodward to geek out on Vim! Joe joined us on the last episode to talk about the Go programming language - and as we’re both huge fans of Vim, we decided to stay on and record a second episode chatting about it!
In it, we talk about both the Vim way of using the keyboard (Vim keybindings), and also Vim the editor and its plugin ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity Grads Should Consider Consulting - Andrew Katz</title>
      <link>https://www.akatz.org/posts/cybersecurity-grads-should-consider-consulting/</link>
      <description>The Problem Too many times, I have heard this plea from college grads on /r/cybersecurity and LinkedIn:
“My BS in Cybersecurity didn’t teach me useful skills, and I can’t find a job.”
These grads are faced with the beaten-to-death conundrum: you need experience to get experience. On top of that, there are applicants with a few years under their belt to compete against for these jobs.
Unless you know someone or convince a hiring manager to take a chance on you, getting an entry-level, in-house cybersecurity job without experience is exceedingly difficult.</description>

      <description>After having worked in different organization with different levels of maturity, and different backgrounds I mature some opinion on why software is difficult.
But the answer is difficult and messy, and nobody like it.

      <description>Twitter is - was - such a unique place. Somewhere where you can have the President
of the United States coexist with teenagers writing fan fiction; where
celebrities give personal insights into their lives while government
departments post memes about public safety;
the place that gave us @Horse_ebooks and @dril.</description>
