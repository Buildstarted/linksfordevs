      <title>Record and publish your meeting</title>
      <link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/screen_record_meetings/</link>
      <description>Scenario: You’re in a handover session and explain everything in great detail but Dave is too hungover, Jim is on holiday and Jane is at another meeting and Chris isn’t asking any questions and in any case Trevor (who is actually going to be looking after this system after handover) hasn’t been recruited yet.
Wouldn’t it be useful to record the session and make it available? Now, this piece of writing does not explore whether we should be recording meetings, nor does it attempt to answer the question of whether good documentation wouldn’t be preferable to having to sit and spend hours watching someone droning on about something that could be condensed into a five minute read of a blog post.</description>
