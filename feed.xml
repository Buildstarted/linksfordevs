      <title>Stripe Subscription States</title>
      <link>https://solmaz.io/stripe-subscription-states</link>
      <description>This is a quick note on Subscription states on Stripe. Subscriptions are objects which track products with recurring payments. Stripe docs on Subscriptions are very comprehensive, but for some reason they don’t include a state diagram that shows the transitions between different states of a subscription. They do have one for Invoices, so maybe this post will inspire them to add one.</description>
