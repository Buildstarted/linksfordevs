      <title>How to prioritize work for MVP — todo.space blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.todo.space/2024/03/16/how-to-prioritize-work-for-mvp/</link>
      <description>Prioritization is a perplexing thing. It&amp;#39;s a universally familiar term. However, when people attempt to prioritize anything — it becomes surprisingly hard to do. Even if they don&amp;#39;t end up arguing, the typical outcome of a prioritization exercise is a pile of tasks assigned to a particular bucket like P0, P1, P2 or P3 — corresponding to Critical, High, Medium and Low priority. Usually, this will yield enough confidence to feel satisfied and to believe that the job is done and everything is clear. But before long, it&amp;#39;ll be clear that nothing is clear at all. Why is that?</description>

      <title>My Home Server Journey - From Raspberry Pi to Ryzen</title>
      <link>https://blog.viktorpetersson.com/2024/05/04/home-server-journey.html</link>
      <description>Introduction Back when I was living in a snug studio flat in London, I began my home server adventure with a Raspberry Pi 3. This move to a settled lifestyle came after years of living as a digital nomad, during which I had fully minimized my personal belongings to adapt to a constantly mobile life. The shift to a more permanent base in London marked a new chapter where I could explore more stationary tech projects like setting up a home server.</description>

      <title>Transformers Dashboard &amp;#129302;&amp;#128200;</title>
      <link>https://v4nn4.github.io/posts/transformers-dashboard/</link>
      <description>➡️ https://transformers-dashboard.vercel.app
Since the publication of the now famous 2017 paper Attention is All You Need1, many large language models based on the transformer architecture have emerged. Fortunately, some studies 2 3 have compiled extensive data on many published models, including the dimensions of their transformers.
Much like my experience learning about CNNs and their growth in complexity, I wanted to analyze LLM transformers. Which models are the largest? What is the optimal size for the feed-forward layer?</description>

      <title>Time-based CSS Animations</title>
      <link>https://yuanchuan.dev/time-based-css-animations</link>
      <description>In my earlier post Time Uniform For CSS Animation,
    I took a note about a way to do CSS animations with time ticks instead of keyframes.
    It was limited applicable because CSS lacked the ability of doing complex Math calculations.
  
  
    After years of wait, CSS now has enough Math functions supported,
    particularly mod(), round(),
    and trigonometric functions.
    It&amp;#39;s time to revisit the time-based way of animation, hope it&amp;#39;ll be more useful this time.</description>
