      <title>The updated GetGCMemoryInfo API in .NET 5.0 and how it can help you | .NET Blog</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-updated-getgcmemoryinfo-api-in-net-5-0-and-how-it-can-help-you/</link>
      <description>A bit of history In .NET 3.0 we introduced a GC.GetGCMemoryInfo API for library code to get memory load related things (this was used in ArrayPool for example) so it exposed things library folks wanted at the time. In 5.0 I got requests from folks to monitor more things about the GC.</description>

      <title>「Dflat」Structured Data Store for Mobile</title>
      <link>https://dflat.io/</link>
      <description>If you are familiar with Core Data or Realm, Dflat occupies the same space as these two in your application. Unlike these two, Dflat has a different set of features and makes very different trade-offs. These features and trade-offs are grounded from real-world experiences in writing some of the world largest apps. Dflat is also built from ground-up using Swift and hopefully, you will find it is natural to interact with in the Swift language.</description>

      <title>How to Think for Yourself</title>
      <link>http://paulgraham.com/think.html</link>
      <description>There are some kinds of work that you can&amp;#39;t do well without thinking
differently from your peers. To be a successful scientist, for
example, it&amp;#39;s not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be
both correct and novel. You can&amp;#39;t publish papers saying things other
people already know. You need to say things no one else has realized
yet.</description>

      <description>Building upon the preliminary notes on analyzing Disk and File I/O performance with ETW traces, I’ll go into some more of the columns in the data. The Priority column represents the I/O priority, where higher numbers are more urgent and lower numbers are less urgent.</description>
