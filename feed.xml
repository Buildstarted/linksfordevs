      <description>I recently came across a post about &amp;quot;The Energy Bill 2023 and the Fusion of Technology and Law - We are going to be governed under &amp;#39;Law 3.0&amp;#39;, and we won&amp;#39;t like it one little bit&amp;quot;.

      <link>https://vancelucas.com/blog/the-emails-you-send-when-running-a-saas-business/</link>
      <description>Nobody really prepared me for the amount of different emails I would have to send when running a SaaS business. It&amp;#39;s something I didn&amp;#39;t even think about - all I was thinking about was what to build, and what problems I wanted to solve with my software. Now after running…</description>

      <title>Potentials of Multitenancy Fine-Tuned LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://le.qun.ch/en/blog/2023/09/11/multi-lora-potentials/</link>
      <description>As open-source pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) become more powerful and permissive, more and more users are incorporating LLMs into their projects. An essential adaptation step is the integration of domain-specific documents into the pre-trained model, known as fine-tuning. Often, the additional knowledge from domain-specific documents is minuscule compared to what the pre-trained model already knows. In such scenarios, the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique proves valuable. With LoRA, a fine-tuned model adds fewer than 0.1% of parameters to the pre-trained model. In concrete terms, this means a LoRA fine-tuned model increases storage by only 10~200 MB, depending on the configuration. From a computational standpoint, given the marginal increase in parameters compared to the pre-trained model, the additional computational load is relatively small. Considering the minimal storage addition and computational overhead, I believe there’s potential in developing a multitenancy fine-tuned LLM serving service. This service could host thousands of LoRA models, all sharing the same backbone LLM. With batching, each user request would invoke a distinct fine-tuned model, thereby amortizing storage and computational costs across various models. In my previous blog post, I delved into the batching effects in LLM serving. In this post, I’ll detail why multitenancy LoRA serving has immense potential.</description>

      <title>Software engineer titles - let&amp;#39;s get rid of them (??)</title>
      <link>https://workdad.dev/posts/software-eng-titles/</link>
      <description>One of the worst ideas that I’ve seen in tech companies is to strip away titles from software engineers and just call them that. Levels are obviously preserved1, because you still need to be able to compensate according to them but they are internal and not supposed to be divulged.
The justifications I’ve seen for this have been along the lines of
Some people feel intimidated by a person’s title, particularly if the gap is big (say, junior and staff); It puts everyone in the same bucket, erasing differences and giving everyone a “we are all just software engineers, let’s work together” vibe; It allows everyone to be able to step up and own any engineering problem because, again, “we are all just software engineers here”; I’ve also heard of something-something solves under-slotting of minorities (seriously, can’t remember the reason exactly because it was just too wrong).</description>

      <title>.NET Rocks! IoT Development using Particle Photon with Colleen Lavin</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1863</link>
      <description>What can you do with a Particle Photon? While in an aluminum Airstream trailer in a thunderstorm at the Copenhagen Developers Festival, Carl and Richard talked to Colleen Lavin about her work with the Particle Photon IoT device - and its many maker possibilities! Colleen talks about making it easy to start building a device - but the struggle with so many choices to actually pick a project. The conversation also digs into making production versions of your device so that they are smaller, cheaper, and very reliable - it&amp;#39;s a fun time to be a maker!</description>

      <title>Building a Minimal ASP.NET Core clone</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/e84dec43-51f1-4c70-8b3b-dcdb1c3164ce</link>
      <description>In this article, we will build a minimal version of what ASP.NET Core does - yes, you read right. We will create a very simplistic clone of ASP.NET Core to discuss how the whole thing works. Beginning with a simple console application, we will add the necessary components to make it work as a web server. Bonus points for our own middleware pipeline and dependency injection.

      <title>Exploring the expander from .NET MAUI Community Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://askxammy.com/exploring-the-expander-from-net-maui-community-toolkit/</link>
      <description>Imagine designing a user interface filled with distinct elements, each boasting its unique header and intricate details. To achieve a streamlined visual layout and save space, consider displaying only the headers and revealing the details upon selection. With the Expander control from the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit, this vision is entirely attainable. Join me, and I&amp;#39;ll guide you step-by-step to a implementation. &amp;#128149;
The explanation will be divided into the following points:


&amp;#128313; .NET MAUI Community Toolkit: Implementation
&amp;#128313; &amp;#160;What is a Expander?
&amp;#128313; &amp;#160;How to implement it?




&amp;#128295;&amp;#160;First of all... What do I need to know?
What is .NET MAUI Community Toolkit??

 	It’s a collection of reusable elements such as animations, behaviors &amp;#160;converters, among others, for developing applications for iOS, Android, macOS and WinUI using MAUI.

✍️ Important!&amp;#160;Adding this configuration to your project just once is enough to fully benefit from the Community Toolkit. If you&amp;#39;ve already implemented it using another NuGet feature, feel free to skip this step.



[expand title=&amp;#128295; Still haven&amp;#39;t implemented it? Check it here!

]

 	Add from NuGet Package: Community.Toolkit.Maui



 	Now let’s initialize:&amp;#160;Go to your MauiProgram.cs file

In the CreateMauiApp method, place in the .UseMauiApp&amp;lt;App&amp;gt;()&amp;#160;line and just below it add the following line of code:



⚠ Don’t forget to add the using CommunityToolkit.Maui;at the top of the class.

[/expand]

 	Finally, add the following namespace:





Let&amp;#39;s start!
What is a Expander?
The Expander serves as an expandable container which is composed of a header (the content visible before expansion) and a container, designed to hold the detailed content linked to each header.




How to implement it?&amp;#160;
In order to show the Expander on screen, you must utilize two elements: The Header and The Content. Each one of these includes specific properties that help in the Expander configuration.
Let&amp;#39;s see a preview of what the structure should be like, and consequently we will start detailing the explanation.


However, before delving into incorporating the two previously mentioned elements, it is important to add the tags that will house them. To establish this foundation, you simply need to integrate the following tags provided below:





&amp;#128313; Header
The header remains constantly in view, and a simple click or tap will expand or hide the content. Ensure you populate it with read-only material, steering clear of controls demanding further user engagement.
Exactly where it says &amp;lt;!-- The Header element goes here--&amp;gt; in the previous block, add the &amp;lt;Expander.Header&amp;gt; tags, here&amp;#160;you can add all the visual elements you need, for this example I have only added a Label.


&amp;#128313; Content
The content is what the user will see when interacting with the header, fluidly alternating between its visibility and hiding each time the header is selected.
The integration is intuitive and you do not need additional tags. Once you&amp;#39;ve set your header tags, simply add an element to hold the detailed content. For this example I will use the VerticalStackLayout, within the layout I can add all the visual elements I need.

&amp;#128683; Limitations
➖ Expander does not support ListView on iOS/MacCatalyst.




And done! &amp;#128526; From now on, you are ready to use Expander in your .NET MAUI applications! &amp;#128154;&amp;#128149;

&amp;lt;Label Text=”Thanks for reading!&amp;#160;&amp;#128075; ” /&amp;gt;
