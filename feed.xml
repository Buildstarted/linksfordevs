      <title>What&amp;#39;s in a name?</title>
      <link>https://joshcannon.me/2024/07/05/package-names.html</link>
      <description>Background Naming is important (as well as hard). Good names are good. Bad names are… bad. And we name a lot of things. In Python (a name) code is bundled and uploaded as a package (another name), usually to the Python Package Index (PyPI, a third name). Inside of these...</description>

      <title>Learn Nix the Fun Way</title>
      <link>https://fzakaria.com/2024/07/05/learn-nix-the-fun-way.html</link>
      <description>This is a post inspired by many talks I’ve given to engineering groups about Nix. You can see an example of one such talk Why I love Nix, and you should too I’ve given a lot of Nix talks. I’ve given Nix talks internally at companies where I’ve introduced it, at local meetups and even at NixCon. Giving a talk about Nix is hard. As engineers I find often we try to explain why or how Nix works but never show the end result. Many of the talks I’ve given start explaining “Nix developed as part of Eelco’s PhD thesis in 2003” and immediately eyes roll. Let’s do it different this time. Let’s learn Nix the fun way.</description>

      <title>(modal)</title>
      <link>https://wryl.tech/projects/modal.html</link>
      <description>Modal is a flexible general purpose programming language based on the concept of rewriting. It was created in 2018 as a response to the rise in implementation complexity for high-level languages.

The language has a single operation:
    * Find a pattern.
    * Replace that pattern with another pattern.

All Modal code is phrased in terms of &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot;, which specify a pattern and a replacement.

Modal programs &amp;quot;evolve&amp;quot; over the course of multiple replacement operations, replacing parts of themselves and morphing into a final &amp;quot;result&amp;quot; where no more rules may be applied.

Modal programs manipulate a global &amp;quot;tree&amp;quot; structure, similar to (term rewriting systems). All search-and-replace operations happen on this single, global tree.</description>

      <title>Properly Testing Concurrent Data Structures</title>
      <link>https://matklad.github.io/2024/07/05/properly-testing-concurrent-data-structures.html</link>
      <description>There&amp;#39;s a fascinating Rust library, loom, which can be used to
thoroughly test lock-free data structures. I always wanted to learn how it works. I still do! But
recently I accidentally implemented a small toy which, I think, contains some of the loom&amp;#39;s ideas,
and it seems worthwhile to write about that. The goal here isn&amp;#39;t to teach you what you should be
using in practice (if you need that, go read loom&amp;#39;s docs), but rather to derive a couple of neat
ideas from first principles.</description>
