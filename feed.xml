      <title>Check if NuGet packages are publicly available</title>
      <link>https://jan-v.nl/post/2025/check-if-nuget-packages-are-publicly-available/</link>
      <description>When creating solutions for a company, you often use an internal package feed.
There might come a time when you need to provide the source code to an external party or you want to make the solution open source.
If this has ever happened to you, you know one of the first things to validate if all dependencies (NuGet packages) are available to the public. Especially in large corporations it‚Äôs easy to use some platform packages used throughout the company but should not be shared with the public.</description>

      <title>Building Real-Time Applications With SignalR &amp; .NET 9 (full tutorial)</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=Oiepl-LLfIs</link>
      <description>Want to master Clean Architecture? Go here: https://bit.ly/3PupkOJ
Want to unlock Modular Monoliths? Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt
Get the source code here: https://www.patreon.com/milanjovanovic

Tired of polling your backend every 5 seconds for updates? In this full tutorial, I‚Äôll show you how to build real-time functionality into your .NET application using SignalR ‚Äî no page reloads, no polling, just smooth, live updates!

In this video, you'll learn:

- How to configure SignalR in your .NET backend
- Building and exposing a SignalR Hub
- Sending targeted updates to users (not just broadcasting!)
- Securing SignalR connections with JWT authentication
- Setting up a simple HTML/JS client to receive live messages
- Bonus: Strongly-typed client methods for cleaner code

We‚Äôll build a small order tracking app that updates order statuses live in the browser as they change on the backend.

Whether you‚Äôre new to SignalR or looking to implement advanced features like authenticated hubs and user-specific notifications, this tutorial has you covered.

üìå Watch till the end to see how to send secure, targeted messages with just a few lines of code!

      <description>When building Guesswork, a logic programming library for Elixir, I ran into an interesting problem: supporting both logical And as well as infinite streams of possibilities. To give an example, the statement ‚ÄòLet A be some positive number, and let B be some factorial of A‚Äô, has both an infinite stream of values (A could be 1, 2, 3, etc.) and a logical conjunction; it cannot be represented without both.</description>

      <title>On Not Liking Computers ¬´ Paul Boddie's Free Software-related blog</title>
      <link>https://blogs.fsfe.org/pboddie/?p=1497</link>
      <description>Adam Williamson recently wrote about how he no longer really likes computers. This attracted many responses from people who misunderstood him and decided to dispense career advice, including doses of the usual material about ‚Äúfollowing one‚Äôs passion‚Äù or ‚Äúchanging one‚Äôs direction‚Äù (which usually involves becoming some kind of ‚Äúglobal nomad‚Äù), which do make me wonder how some of these people actually pay their bills. Do they have a wealthy spouse or wealthy parents or ‚Äúan inheritance‚Äù, or do they just do lucrative contracting for random entities whose nature or identities remain deliberately obscure to avoid thinking about where the money for those jobs really comes from? Particularly the latter would be the ‚Äúglobal nomad‚Äù way, as far as I can tell.</description>

      <link>https://vitonsky.net/blog/2025/05/15/zeros-in-ux/</link>
      <description>User interfaces everywhere are a bit too generic nowadays, as they must be efficient in terms of maintenance and release time. However, that is not a reason to create a pointless and bad UX. It's enough to monitor the meaningfulness of interfaces and ask yourself, "Does it make sense?" to make the user experience great.</description>
