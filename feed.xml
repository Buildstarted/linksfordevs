      <title>Stop Letting Algorithms Define Your Relationships</title>
      <link>https://kwakubiney.github.io/posts/Stop-Letting-Algorithms-Define-Your-Relationships/</link>
      <description>Why do we give social media so much power over our lives? I’m fairly young, but I’ve had a good experience of life without social media as it exists today. There was a time when we gauged how close certain friends were using much more realistic metrics—but it seems that’s lost among the youth now. I recently got into an argument with a friend, mainly because she was not my number one best friend on Snapchat, and I was very confused. If you don’t use Snapchat a lot, you probably won’t know what I’m talking about, so here’s some brief context. Social media platforms like Snapchat assign “best friend” tags to people you interact with, based on some algorithm that obviously isn’t public. Now, was this person wrong for being jealous? Maybe not. But I’m alarmed at the level of trust and reliance people place on such tagging to make real life decisions. I’m not sure how the tagging works exactly, but the more you interact with someone, the higher they appear on your best friend list. My issue is with Snapchat. Judging who my best friend is based solely on conversation frequency is weird. Conversations have so much more depth to them—context matters. Overall, I just feel like I should be able to opt out of that feature entirely, so I don’t appear on anyone’s best friend list and no one appears on mine. I can only control what I can control, so I’ve deleted Snapchat and ended the friendship.</description>

      <title>Ideas for Super Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://rohan.ga/blog/asi/</link>
      <description>This essay is about the nature and character of algorithms that would lead to artificial super intelligence (ASI) primarily through recursive self improvement. It is a window into my intuitions at the current time.
current bottlenecks OpenAI just recently released a long form podcast talking about primarily pre-training gpt4.5 and the various lessons that it taught them. I never thought I would see such transparency from OpenAI and it serves as valuable insight into the current state of ML research.</description>

      <title>How Claude avoids JSON accuracy issue in tool calling</title>
      <link>https://arcfu.com/post/claude-json-solution/</link>
      <description>There’s an article from Aider that demonstrates reduced accuracy of code generation in LLMs when using tool calls.
In essence, their exercise demonstrates that asking an LLM to return JSON reduces the accuracy of code generation.
Reduced accuracy { "file_path": "package.json", "content": "{"name": "test"}" }  Better ``` // package.json {"name": "test"} ```  The primary hypothesis is that since per-token computation is limited, a part of the computation is instead directed toward getting proper escaping.</description>

      <title>Getting Work Done Using Only TTY</title>
      <link>https://pez.solutions/deep-thoughts/tty-only/</link>
      <description>Picture this: It's a sunny Sunday morning in 1990. You rise, brew a
                fresh cup of coffee, and settle in front of the family computer. With a
                flick of the power switch, the CRT monitor hums to life, degaussing into
                a shaky boot sequence. Lines of text scroll down the screen, and
                finally, the familiar prompt C: awaits your command.</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding without worry or care</title>
      <link>https://prashanth.world/carefree-careless/</link>
      <description>Without a worry
At this point in time, Vibe Coding is probably even past the hype cycle. Just describing to cursor what you want to do and having the editor generally get it right has been extremely liberating for me and many people. My drive to build things in software had waned, mainly because setting up new projects tended to be a lot of busywork. But with Cursor those pieces of busywork are now hyper automated. I don’t have to worry about being derailed due to e.g. updated interfaces to libraries, I can just tell Cursor to “fix it” and continue my main quest.
