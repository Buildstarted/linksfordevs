      <title>Motorway: Seamless high speed BFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10369</link>
      <description>Today&amp;#39;s practical, high performance Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols operate in the partial synchrony model. However, existing protocols are often inefficient when networks are indeed partially synchronous. They obtain either low latency during synchrony or robust recovery from periods of asynchrony. At one end, traditional, view-based BFT protocols optimize for latency in the sunny-network case, but when faced with periods of asynchrony are subject to performance degradations (hangovers) that can last beyond the return to synchrony. At the other end, modern DAG-based BFT protocols recover gracefully from asynchrony, but exhibit lackluster latency during synchronous intervals. To close the gap, this work presents Motorway, a novel high-throughput BFT protocol that offers both low latency and seamless recovery from periods of asynchrony. Motorway combines a highly parallel asynchronous data dissemination layer with a low-latency, partially synchronous consensus mechanism to construct an efficient consensus protocol for partial synchrony. Motorway (i) avoids the hangovers incurred by traditional BFT protocols and (ii) matches the throughput of state of the art DAG-BFT protocols while reducing latency by 2.1x, matching the latency of traditional BFT protocols.</description>

      <title>The Story of Hacking My Air Purifier – Unethical Info</title>
      <link>https://unethical.info/2024/01/24/hacking-my-air-purifier/</link>
      <description>I searched the web for a deal on a decent air purifier and the Xiaomi 4 Pro seemed to meet all my requirements. The filter size, scheduler and air volume ticked all the boxes. I set it up and thought nothing of it until last week my room was lit with the ‘0% remaining’ replace filter warning. I had set my unit up to disable the LCD so this was an unwelcome surprise. I dismissed the warning by clicking the user button to dismiss the error and 15 minutes later it lit up my room again…</description>

      <description>Last year, the company I work for was looking to hire a Backend Engineer. We wanted somebody who was a senior or on their way to becoming one.
The Backend Squad was tasked with designing an interview to help decide who to hire based on technical merit. Above all, we wanted our interview to favor candidates that are good fits. Now, after working with our new hire for about 11 months, we know that we succeeded.</description>

      <link>https://dhruvbindra.com/blogs/containers/</link>
      <description>Containers have emerged as a revolutionary way to deploy applications, offering a unique approach to running software in an isolated environment. This isolation ensures that your application operates independently, safeguarding both the applications running on the host machine and the host machine itself. A container provides a contained space to your application where it is shielded from the external interference of the host machine or other applications running on host machines.</description>
