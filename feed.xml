      <title>Chernobyl Fungus Eats Nuclear Radiation Via Radiosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://www.technologynetworks.com/applied-sciences/videos/chernobyl-fungus-eats-nuclear-radiation-via-radiosynthesis-338464</link>
      <description>A fungus growing near the Chernobyl site was thriving on nuclear radiation thanks to radiosynthesis, using melanin to convert gamma radiation into chemical energy. Scientists are exploring whether its radiation-absorbing properties could be used to protect astronauts in space.</description>

      <description>In July, I promised to begin a trial for fortnightly newsletters, as opposed to the monthly schedule from previously. Today was meant to be the day where the next newsletter was meant to be sent out, but I decided to delay it as I had been busy building a website via Ghost.org and I wanted to start posting there as soon as it was built, so there was minimum interruption in your access to Post Apathy content.</description>

Mozilla needs to focus on Firefox and core technologies, sell privacy-first software as a service, and bring back technical leadership if it truly wants to execute on its mission.</description>
