      <description>A 192-channel phased array microphone, with FPGA data acquisition and beamforming/visualization on the GPU. Phased arrays allow for applications not possible with traditional directional microphones, as the directionality can be changed instantly, after the recording is made, or even be focused at hundreds of thousands of points simultaneously in real time.</description>

      <title>Estimating gym goers: a mark and recapture experiment - Emir&amp;#39;s blog</title>
      <link>https://emiruz.com/post/2023-07-05-gym-mark-recapture/</link>
      <description>I had recently started going to a new specialist gym that runs 3 classes per
day during the working week and is closed the rest of the time. I’ve been at a
few different times on a few different days, and already I was seeing many of
the same people from the first class. It occurred to me that the chance of
seeing the same faces should somehow scale with the number of people going to
the gym, hence it may be possible to estimate the total number of gym members
from the number of people I repeatedly see. I then realised that sounds very
much like a
mark and recapture (MR)
experiment from Ecology, so I did a little bit of research to see how difficult
it would be to estimate the gym members using MR techniques.</description>

      <description>I want to tell you about an idea called that has had a huge influence on the way that I write software. And I mean that in the literal sense: it’s changed the way that I write software; it’s re-shaped my development workflow.
The idea is this: you can write programs that modify themselves.
And I don’t mean macros or metaprogramming or anything fancy like that. I mean that you can write programs that edit their own source code.</description>

      <title>Accessing AVACloud Directly with User Accounts - Dangl.Blog();</title>
      <link>https://blog.dangl.me/archive/accessing-avacloud-directly-with-user-accounts/</link>
      <description>With AVACloud, you would usually use service based accounts to access the API. However, recently we&amp;#39;ve had an interesting use case: A client did the integration for AVACloud in an Excel AddIn, and for this, we wanted to go with individual Dangl.Identity user accounts instead of centrally managed OAuth2 clients.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a super-transmission of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant BA.5.2 in the outdoor night market</title>
      <link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1153303/full</link>
      <description>IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, and mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 continues. The new strain has become more transmissible. The role of aerosol transmission in the pandemic deserves great attention.MethodsIn this observational study, we collected data from market customers and stallholders who had been exposed to the virus in the Qingkou night market on July 31 and were subsequently infected. We analyzed the possible infection zones of secondary cases and aerosol suspension time in ambient air. We described and analyzed the characteristics of the secondary cases and the transmission routes for customers.ResultsThe point source outbreak of COVID-19 in Qingkou night market contained a cluster of 131 secondary cases. In a less-enclosed place like the Qingkou night market, aerosols with BA.5.2 strain released by patients could suspend in ambient air up to 1 h 39 min and still be contagious.ConclusionAerosols with viruses can spread over a relatively long distance and stay in ambient air for a long time in a less enclosed space, but shorter than that under experimental conditions. Therefore, the aerosol suspension time must be considered when identifying and tracing close contact in outbreak investigations.</description>
