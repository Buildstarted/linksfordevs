      <title>A Brillant Copilot</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-brillant-copilot</link>

      <description>In Breaking off the
engagement
Chris Best (Substack CEO) argues that ad-based revenue models are the root

      <title>What happens if I use a squash instead of a true merge when performing one of the git tricks?</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210706-00/?p=105406</link>
      <description>A customer wanted to know which of the git tricks I’ve shared still work if you use a squash instead of a true merge. For example, in the case of splitting a file in two while preserving line history, can this be done with squashing?</description>

      <title>No More Movies</title>
      <link>https://jayriverlong.github.io/2021/07/05/movies.html</link>
      <description>In my junior year of high school, I started getting into movies. My English teacher, who was a serious film buff, warned me half-jokingly: in film, you start with the best and make your way down to the worst. With literature, you grow as a reader and work your way up to the greatest works, many of which are quite difficult. But movies are much more accessible and don’t require nearly as much time, so it’s easier to start with the great works. Over the years you progress to movies that are more obscure, but not necessarily better.</description>

      <description>John Wooden died in 2009. But if you&amp;#39;re a basketball coach today, you&amp;#39;re still living in his shadow.

And for good reason. Wooden&amp;#39;s&amp;#160;record as a basketball coach for UCLA remains&amp;#160;unmatched. He was notorious for his attention to detail, down to&amp;#160;training his players how to put on their socks and lace</description>

      <title>Tech Notes: Leaving Google</title>
      <link>http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2021/07/leaving-google.html</link>
      <description>I left Google this month, after 17 years working there. At the time I left, out
of ~150k employees, only ~300 had worked there longer than me. I have many
stories, and I imagine I might tell some of them on this blog at some point.
Rather than try to fit everything into one post I thought I&amp;#39;d instead use this
post just as a brief announcement and small summary of my career there.</description>
