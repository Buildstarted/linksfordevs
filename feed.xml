      <title>How I Estimate My Tasks</title>
      <link>https://jaitl.pro/post/2021/05/08/task-estimation/</link>
      <description>Estimating a simple task isn’t a problem. The problems arise when the task is complex and unclear. Sometimes I have to estimate complex tasks to measure the sprint time or other activities. To estimate such tasks I have developed my approach over time.</description>

      <title>How to Learn Nix, Part 1: What&amp;#39;s all this about?</title>
      <link>https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-learn-nix/introduction/</link>
      <description>Five years ago, I migrated my VPS from Arch Linux to NixOS.
I had no idea what I was doing. I had never used Nix before. I thought I could figure it out.
Five years later, I’m still running NixOS. And I still have no idea how it works.</description>

      <title>Measure and reduce keyboard input latency with QMK on the Kinesis Advantage</title>
      <link>https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-05-08-keyboard-input-latency-qmk-kinesis/</link>
      <description>Over the last few years, I worked on a few projects around keyboard input latency:
In 2018, I introduced the kinX keyboard controller with 0.2ms of input latency.
In 2020, I introduced the kinT keyboard controller, which works with a wide range of Teensy micro controllers, and both the old KB500 and the newer KB600 Kinesis Advantage models.</description>

      <title>My email workflow in Fastmail - Piet van Zoen</title>
      <link>https://piet.me/my-email-workflow-in-fastmail/</link>
      <description>When I switched to Fastmail from Hey, there were elements of Hey&amp;#39;s approach that worked well for me and I wanted to replicate. I found several articles about setting up a Hey workflow with Fastmail, but the suggested setup relied on creating custom rules for each contact and I found this to be cumbersome. I figured out a slightly different approach and wanted to document what I ended up with.</description>

      <title>Apple Silicon Hardware Secrets: SPRR and Guarded Exception Levels (GXF)</title>
      <link>https://blog.svenpeter.dev/posts/m1_sprr_gxf/</link>
      <description>Over a year ago siguza published a write-up about Apple’s
APRR - a custom ARM extension that redefines pagetable permissions and protects certain parts of
the kernel from itself. Since then Apple has released their M1 chip
which not only features an updated version of APRR but also easily allows to run bare-metal code shortly after boot.
There have been some rumors
about the new version but nothing specific has been (publicly) documented yet.</description>
