      <title>Swift System is Now Open Source</title>
      <link>https://swift.org/blog/swift-system/</link>
      <description>In June, Apple introduced Swift System, a new library for Apple platforms that provides idiomatic interfaces to system calls and low-level currency types. Today, I’m excited to announce that we’re open-sourcing System and adding Linux support! Our vision is for System to eventually act as the single home for low-level system interfaces for all supported Swift platforms.

      <description>I dabbled in Phoenix for a while now, but never really got my hands dirty with it right up until now. Apart from the whole framework being surprisingly well thought through, there are a few things that strike me as being done exceptionally well in Phoenix, compared to the rest of modern web frameworks.

      <title>The failed promise of Web Components – Lea Verou</title>
      <link>https://lea.verou.me/2020/09/the-failed-promise-of-web-components/</link>
      <description>Web Components had so much potential to empower HTML to do more, and make web development more accessible to non-programmers and easier for programmers. Remember how exciting it was every time we got new shiny HTML elements that actually do stuff? Remember how exciting it was to be able to do sliders, color pickers, dialogs, disclosure widgets straight in the HTML, without having to include any widget libraries?</description>

      <title>This AI Restores Old Photos with Damages AUTOMATICALLY</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVo400nmZfc</link>

It also includes facial enhancement which is really accurate too. A pretty big contribution from Microsoft to the open-source realm.
