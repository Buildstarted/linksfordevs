      <title>The Tragedies of Reality Are Coming for You</title>
      <link>https://www.alexirpan.com/2024/07/08/tragedies-of-reality.html</link>
      <description>In 2023, I was at an ML conference. The night was young, the drinks were flowing, and the topic turned to a question: “if you could take any machine learning subfield, and give all their

      <title>The missing parts in Cargo</title>
      <link>https://weihanglo.tw/posts/2024/the-missing-parts-in-cargo/</link>

Having extensive experience with JavaScript, I was accustomed to convenient package managers and couldn’t grasp the enthusiasm—wasn’t such a tool a given for any serious programming language?</description>
