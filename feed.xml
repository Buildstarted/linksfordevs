      <description>Entity Framework Core has great built-in support for optimistic concurrency control. The best way to utilize this on SQL Server is via a rowversion column.

      <title>Automate everything that is not part of the problem you’re solving</title>
      <link>https://blog.frederikring.com/articles/automate-whats-not-part-of-the-problem/</link>
      <description>When faced with the decision if something is worth automating or not, the default reaction for most developers and product managers will be simple: estimating the time spent on a manual task, and comparing it with the time it would take to automate the task away. Whatever takes the least time wins. When building Offen, the decision of what to automate came up quite a few times as well, and I have realized that only looking at time spent might be a bit short-sighted.</description>

      <description>One of the general recommendations you may often read is to use ConfigureAwait(false) in library code. This is so that when the library is used, it does not block the synchronization context in use by the application (e.g. the UI thread). If the library doesn’t know anything about the app, it doesn’t depend on the application’s context and doesn’t need to run within it. This makes sense but it ends up truly meaning that you have to put ConfigureAwait(false) on every async call in your entire library. To me, that seems ...excessive.</description>
