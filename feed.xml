      <title>Http.sys Delegation</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/articles/httpsys-delegation.html</link>
      <description>Http.sys delegation is a kernel level feature added into newer versions of Windows which allows a request to be transferred from the receiving process&amp;#39;s http.sys queue to a target process&amp;#39;s http.sys queue with very little overhead or added latency. For this delegation to work, the receiving process is only allowed to read the request headers. If the body has started to be read or a response has started, trying to delegate the request will fail. The response will not be visible to the proxy after delegation, which limits the functionality of the session affinity and passive health checks components, as well as some of the load balancing algorithms. Internally, YARP leverage&amp;#39;s ASP.NET Core&amp;#39;s IHttpSysRequestDelegationFeature</description>

      <title>Advancements in machine learning for machine learning</title>
      <link>https://blog.research.google/2023/12/advancements-in-machine-learning-for.html</link>
      <description>With the recent and accelerated advances in machine learning (ML), machines can understand natural language, engage in conversations, draw images, create videos and more. Modern ML models are programmed and trained using ML programming frameworks, such as TensorFlow, JAX, PyTorch, among many others. These libraries provide high-level instructions to ML practitioners, such as linear algebra operations (e.g., matrix multiplication, convolution, etc.) and neural network layers (e.g., 2D convolution layers, transformer layers). Importantly, practitioners need not worry about how to make their models run efficiently on hardware because an ML framework will automatically optimize the user&amp;#39;s model through an underlying compiler. The efficiency of the ML workload, thus, depends on how good the compiler is. A compiler typically relies on heuristics to solve complex optimization problems, often resulting in suboptimal performance.</description>

      <title>Christmas Countdown: #8 Code maintenance is 90% of the work</title>
      <link>https://www.codeart.dk/blog/2023/12/christmas-countdown-8-code-maintenance-is-90-of-the-work/</link>
      <description>Greenfield development is by far the most fun for everybody. So it&amp;#39;s easy to forget that most development work is actually maintenance. And every new line of code you write means more code to maintain. Almost all codebases I review have significant technical debt. And the debt starts to accumulate from the moment you start coding.</description>
