      <title>Short Domain Names</title>
      <link>https://jameswillia.ms/posts/shortest-domain-names.html</link>
      <description>What’s the shortest in-use domain name? There are quite a few three-letter domain names being used, such as Google’s g.co and Facebook’s m.me.
However, these aren’t the shortest domain names in use. A TLD is a valid domain name on its own, and there’s nothing stopping registrars from creating A records for their TLDs. For example:

      <description>In July, I promised to begin a trial for fortnightly newsletters, as opposed to the monthly schedule from previously. Today was meant to be the day where the next newsletter was meant to be sent out, but I decided to delay it as I had been busy building a website via Ghost.org and I wanted to start posting there as soon as it was built, so there was minimum interruption in your access to Post Apathy content.</description>
