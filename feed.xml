      <title>In defense of simple architectures</title>
      <link>https://danluu.com/simple-architectures/</link>
      <description>Wave is a $1.7B company with 70 engineers1 whose product is a CRUD app that adds and subtracts numbers. In keeping with this, our architecture is a standard CRUD app architecture, a Python monolith on top of Postgres. Starting with a simple architecture and solving problems in simple ways where possible has allowed us to scale to this size while engineers mostly focus on work that delivers value to users.</description>

      <description>This is one of the articles that has been sitting in my draft folder for a long time. Every time I had an interaction with a bank I added to it. I feel confident at this point to publish because my experiences with getting a bank account or a credit card here in the US have been mostly awful.
Let me back up a bit. I moved to the US in September 2019.</description>

      <description>In our Akka.NET Community Standup on March 9th, 2022 we presented for the very first time Akka.Hosting - a new approach to configuring Akka.NET and managing ActorSystems that requires zero HOCON, automatically enforces Akka.NET best practices, is type-checked, and makes it easy to pass IActorRefs via Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection using the brand new ActorRegistry construct. Although Akka.Hosting is part of the current Akka.NET v1.5 development effort underway, it is already available for use with Akka.NET v1.4 and is ready for production use.</description>

      <description>It is not that hard to create a script that shows and hides parts of the document, but often we forget about how our visitors use the products we build. Especially when it comes to navigating huge documents, people tend to use the “find in page” functionality of browsers. And when they do and we hid content with JavaScript, browsers would either not find the content or users won’t know where in the document it is.</description>
