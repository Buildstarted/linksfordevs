      <title>Integration Testing with xUnit</title>
      <link>https://jimmybogard.com/integration-testing-with-xunit/</link>
      <description>A few years back, I had given up on xUnit in favor of Fixie because of the flexibility that Fixie provides. The xUnit project is highly opinionated, and geared strictly towards unit tests. It&amp;#39;s great for that.  A broader testing strategy includes much more than just unit tests. With Fixie,</description>

      <title>Records Deep Dive: What, Why and How | NDC Melbourne 2021</title>
      <link>https://ndcmelbourne.com/agenda/records-deep-dive-what-why-and-how/7ffac16b0602</link>
      <description>Records were a new feature introduced in C# 9 that allow concise definition of immutable data classes that you may have already seen or even used. In order to support them there were also related new concepts introduced like &amp;quot;primary constructors&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;init accessors&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;with expressions&amp;quot;, and there are also some traps with records that you should be aware of, like for example I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t have referred to them as &amp;quot;immutable data classes&amp;quot;.</description>

      <title>Notes on Windows 11 - Jorge Pinto</title>
      <link>https://jorgepinto.neocities.org/_logs/20210720-notes-on-windows-11.html</link>
      <description>- I have no idea what Windows &amp;#39;Insider&amp;#39; means, I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m using a public beta, a Release Candidate or just a fake PR build. I honestly don&amp;#39;t know if this build is actually an ad. I don&amp;#39;t even remember how I became an &amp;#39;Insider&amp;#39; in the first place. Did I fill out a form years ago or is MS giving these licences away like candy with a shiny button to get free-pass on Early-Access shenanigans? Of course I could just read the build documentation but my point is I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to. They used to call these things alphas, betas, RCs, etc. for a reason. Windows 11 [/ VSC] &amp;#39;Insiders&amp;#39; means nothing. And it&amp;#39;s dumb. It&amp;#39;s like calling it Windows VIP (which admitedly, sounds kinda cool - better that &amp;#39;Insiders&amp;#39;, for sure).</description>
