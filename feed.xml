      <title>Building a CRUD API with ABP Framework, ASP.NET Core, and PostgreSQL</title>
      <link>https://www.berkansasmaz.com/building-a-crud-api-with-abp-framework-asp-net-core-and-postgresql/</link>
      <description>I recently read &amp;quot;Building a CRUD API with ASP.NET Core Web API and PostgreSQL&amp;quot; by M. Oly Mahmud on DEV Community. While it’s a solid introduction to building a basic CRUD API, it lacks features like permissions and validation—important for real-world scenarios. Inspired by this, I decided</description>

      <description>Models such as o1 and Gemini 2.0 flash thinking that excel in reasoning have shown to solve complex tasks by producing a long internal chain of thought, among other advancements. However, the technical details and model weights are un-accessible, presenting a barrier to the participation of the academic and open-source communities.</description>

      <title>Terraform Modules: Stop Copy-Pasting and Start Reusing Like a Pro - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/terraform-modules-stop-copy-pasting-and-start-reusing-like-a-pro/</link>
      <description>Ever feel like you’re copy-pasting the same Terraform code over and over again? Deploying resource groups, VMs, networks—all with slightly different names? Yeah, that’s a nightmare waiting to happen. Luckily, Terraform modules exist to make our lives easier! Modules let you write infrastructure code once and reuse it across different projects, environments, or even teams.</description>

      <title>The Infinite Game Meets Azure Security with Bojan Magušić</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=8uluLLoq1PQ</link>
      <description>RJJ Software&amp;#39;s Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software&amp;#39;s Podcasting Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.

 Show Notes &amp;quot;I always believe, and this is taking my kind of Microsoft hat off, and I&amp;#39;m sharing my personal view here. I definitely believe regardless of the public cloud provider in question, they&amp;#39;re all part of a bigger ecosystem. And I emphasize the word ecosystem. I believe security as, you know, a problem statement of our time, it&amp;#39;s just so complex that it really can&amp;#39;t be solved by a single company or by a single organization or a single individual. You really need to see like collaboration and cooperation taking place across different sectors, across different public cloud providers.&amp;quot;— Bojan Magušić

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie &amp;quot;GaProgMan&amp;quot; Taylor.

 In this episode, Bojan Magušić joined us to talk about both his new book &amp;quot;Azure Security&amp;quot; but also his work as part of the security team at Azure and his top tips for protecting your digital landscape (aka your apps and services) on the public cloud.

 Not only did Bojan and I talk about the security aspects of protecting your public cloud digital landscape, but we also talked about how all the public cloud providers actually work together to ensure that everyone is protected from CVEs and exploits when they are discovered. An application of the Infinite Game, if you will—if you&amp;#39;re not sure what that is, we cover that in the episode, too.

 &amp;quot;So instead of at times you know thinking of it as a zero-sum game, I definitely believe there is opportunity to kind of expand the ecosystem and partner in meaningful ways where we can share information and share insights and guidance and even skill sets that are going to make us all as an industry and, you know, as clients more secure.&amp;quot;— Bojan Magušić

 Anyway, without further ado, let&amp;#39;s sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we&amp;#39;ll dive into the core of Modern .NET.

      <description>Hey there! I’m glad to finally start paying my blogging debt :) as this is something I’ve been planning to do for quite some time now. To get the ball rolling, I’ve shared some bits about me in my very first blog post Ol&amp;#225; Mundo.
In this article, I’m going to walk through what we’ve been working on since last year in the Chromium Ozone/Wayland project, on which I’ve been involved (directly or indirectly) since I’ve joined Igalia back in 2018.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;#39;m James. And in this video you&amp;#39;ll learn all about the types of tests you should be writing when building an event-driven system. Specifically, schema and contract tests.

In this video you&amp;#39;ll see a strategy you can use in your .NET applications to make sure you never make a breaking change again.
