      <title>Apple’s “EDR” Brings High Dynamic Range to Non-HDR Displays — Prolost</title>
      <link>https://prolost.com/blog/edr</link>
      <description>Apple caused quite a stir with the announcement of their Pro Display XDR, a High Dynamic Range display that occupies a convoluted space in the market. It seeks to be both a Very Nice Computer Display, and a reference HDR video monitor — but by most measures it’s far too expensive to be the former, and not quite up to the rarified specs of the latter. Confusingly, it also outperforms some HDR displays costing considerably more, by some metrics. It’s currently the only display-only device Apple makes, and it’s simultaneously ludicrously expensive and a too-good-to-be-true deal. Suffice it to say that while there may be very few people for whom the Pro Display XDR is the unquestionably right choice, they know who they are, and they don’t need the internet’s advice about it.</description>

      <title>Remapping Keys with XKB and KLFC</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/remap-keys-xkb-klfc/</link>
      <description>An introduction to hacking keyboard layouts with X keyboard extension (XKB) and klfc, focused on Colemak and vim bindings
 Background Inspite of maximizing ergonomic bindings for most common software (e.g. Vimium, doom-emacs), every operation with the arrow keys still trouble me. Here I will lay out my experiments transitioning to a stable, uniquely defined setup with the X keyboard extension.
Series This post is part of a series on Colemak and keyboard management in general.</description>

      <description>Is Youtube machine learning drawing a connection between Steve Jobs and DevOps? Is that why Youtube keeps recommending a Steve Jobs related video after I watch a DevOps related video?
Maybe Youtube is on to something. I had an aha moment after watching an interview with Andy Miller about the Apple acquisition of his company, Quattro Wireless. Andy talks about Steve’s constant demands to simplify, and his advice to Andy: “Use a picture.</description>

      <description>This post is about documenting OAuth 2 protected ASP.NET Core Web API using Swashbuckle.
