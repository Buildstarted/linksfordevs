      <title>Neurobiological foundations of neurologic music therapy: rhythmic entrainment and the motor system</title>
      <link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01185/full</link>
      <description>Entrainment is defined by a temporal locking process in which one system’s motion or signal frequency entrains the frequency of another system. This process is a universal phenomenon that can be observed in physical (e.g., pendulum clocks) and biological systems (e.g., fire flies). However, entrainment can also be observed between human sensory and motor systems. The function of rhythmic entrainment in rehabilitative training and learning was established for the first time by Thaut and colleagues in several research studies in the early 1990s. It was shown that the inherent periodicity of auditory rhythmic patterns could entrain movement patterns in patients with movement disorders (see for a review: Thaut et al., 1999). Physiological, kinematic, and behavioral movement analysis showed very quickly that entrainment cues not only changed the timing of movement but also improved spatial and force parameters. Mathematical models have shown that anticipatory rhythmic templates as critical time constraints can result in the complete specification of the dynamics of a movement over the entire movement cycle, thereby optimizing motor planning and execution. Furthermore, temporal rhythmic entrainment has been successfully extended into applications in cognitive rehabilitation and speech and language rehabilitation, and thus become one of the major neurological mechanisms linking music and rhythm to brain rehabilitation. These findings provided a scientific basis for the developmen...</description>

      <title>100 Tips for a Better Life - LessWrong</title>
      <link>https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7hFeMWC6Y5eaSixbD/100-tips-for-a-better-life</link>
      <description>The other day I made an advice thread based on Jacobian’s from last year! If you
know a source for one of these, shout and I’ll edit it in.



Possessions

1 .If you want to find out about people’s opinions on a product, google 
&amp;lt;product&amp;gt; reddit. You’ll get real people arguing, as compared to the SEO’d
Google results.

2. Some banks charge you $20 a month for an account, others charge you 0. If
you’re with one of the former, have a good explanation for what those $20 are
buying.

3. Things you use for a significant fraction of your life (bed: 1/3rd,
office-chair: 1/4th) are worth investing in.

4. “Where is the good knife?” If you’re looking for your good X, you have bad
Xs. Throw those out.

5. If your work is done on a computer, get a second monitor. Less time
navigating between windows means more time for thinking.

6. Establish clear rules about when to throw out old junk. Once clear rules are
established, junk will probably cease to be a problem. This is because any rule
would be superior to our implicit rules (“keep this broken stereo for five years
in case I learn how to fix it”).

7. Don’t buy CDs for people. They have Spotify. Buy them merch from a band they
like instead. It’s more personal and the band gets more money.

8. When buying things, time and money trade-off against each other. If you’re
low on money, take more time to find deals. If you’re low on time, stop looking
for great deals and just buy things quickly online.



Cooking

9. Steeping minutes: Green at 3, black at 4, herbal at 5. Good tea is that
simple!

10. Food actually can be both cheap, healthy, tasty, and relatively quick to
prepare. All it requires is a few hours one day to prepare many meals for the
week.

11. Cooking pollutes the air. Opening windows for a few minutes after cooking
can dramatically improve air quality.

12. Food taste can be made much more exciting through simple seasoning. It’s
also an opportunity for expression. Buy a few herbs and spices and experiment
away.

I want to start by stating an obvious but important truth: your brain is amazing. You are constantly and rapidly solving unimaginably complex problems that make even the most challenging FAANG whiteboard problem look like a stroll in the park.</description>
