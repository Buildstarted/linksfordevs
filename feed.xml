      <title>I looked out the window and saw it was grey outside</title>
      <link>https://jspann.me/blog/posts/sky-cam/</link>
      <description>But I wondered how grey? Rochester has some of the greyest skies of all cities in the United States but after 9 years here, this felt like one of the sunniest winters ever. I couldn’t prove it, but I did want to compare the sky colors across months and hopefully see trends over a few years.
I had remembered previously seeing a NYC sky color website and loved the idea. I wanted to build something similar but for Rochester but also build out a dataset for future comparisons.</description>

      <description>Someone probably looked up one day and said, “That is the ‘sky’.” They told their friends, and then they told their friends. At some point, when anyone looked up at the vast expanse above them and needed a way to describe it, the word that came to mind was “sky.”
Maybe there is something that you are looking at in your life that will have a similar story one day. It might not be as profound as naming “sky,” but it describes a service we use like “Google” or “Uber.</description>

      <description>During the early pandemic, a topic came up I never thought I would need to worry about.  Who would cut my hair?  My Asian hair is a bit funky where it is similar to Wolverine in X-men.  After a couple weeks the sides get really pointy and uncomfortable so I would go to the barber probably every 3-4 weeks.</description>

      <description>Today is both a good day and a bad day. Bad because I finally have to come to terms with the game I spent four years making is no longer available on the App Store or the Google Play Store which effectively means you can’t run it anywhere anymore.  The bittersweet part is that it’s given me the excuse to open source the game as well as my previous game project Solaria Tactics.</description>

      <title>Why Does &amp;#39;is-number&amp;#39; Package Have 59M Weekly Downloads?</title>
      <link>https://shubhamjain.co/2024/02/29/why-is-number-package-have-59m-downloads/</link>
      <description>
Why does this simple one-line package have [so many downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-number)? Is the JS community filled with folks who can&amp;#39;t do this simple task without relying on a library? Are they rightfully the butt of all jokes? Have they learned nothing from the `left-pad` fiasco that [broke the internet](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code)?

The answer is more nuanced than that. &amp;#39;npm&amp;#39; methodology of counting downloads is [admittedly naive](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/92574016600/numeric-precision-matters-how-npm-download-counts-work.html).

&amp;gt; npm’s download stats are na&amp;#239;ve by design: they are simply a count of the number of HTTP 200 responses we served that were tarball files, i.e. packages. This means the number&amp;#160;**includes**:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; - automated build servers
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; - downloads by mirrors
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; - robots that download every package for analysis

This has led to some programmers pumping up their download numbers by creating simple packages, and using them in their own packages, and using those packages to create more packages. As a result, these silly utility packages hide beneath multiple layers. Any successful package in the upper layers creates a cascade of increasing download numbers.

I don&amp;#39;t believe many programmers are using `is-number` knowingly. It just gets included when you use a popular package. In fact, it&amp;#39;s there even in my `node_modules` folder. I figured out the chain that led to its inclusion:

tailwindcss -&amp;gt; chokidar -&amp;gt; braces -&amp;gt; fill-range -&amp;gt; to-regex-range -&amp;gt; is-number

The last four packages in the chain have been written by the same author. 

---

Nonetheless, this kind of dependency hell is ridiculous and something should be done about it. Too many packages are getting downloaded, consuming disk space and download time, that should ideally only be a single function or a part of a bigger lodash-like package. There are thirty-seven &amp;quot;is-*&amp;quot; packages in my node_modules folder. That&amp;#39;s just bonkers! 

There are three solutions I can think of: 

1. npm should differentiate between direct and indirect downloads. I am not certain if it&amp;#39;s possible with how npm works, but downloads triggered by a dependency don&amp;#39;t accurately reflect the popularity of the package. People who visit the npm page are usually unaware of how the numbers work.

2. There should be a concentrated effort to replace the packages causing this mess with packages that inline their dependencies.

3. Like [Bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/), there should be a website that lists the total number of packages you&amp;#39;ll end up downloading when you include the dependency. Hopefully, it will encourage the community to seek packages with fewer indirect dependencies.

Tons of hidden costs come with having hundreds of dependencies, but the JS community has largely ignored them. It&amp;#39;s time we made some effort to address the issue.

      <description>When you get a warm introduction or have someone pass along your deck, that’s the first chance you get in front of a VC (and possibly the only chance). As a founder, you think, “all they need to see is how awesome my idea is, our business plan, and then it will be inevitable.”
There are many websites that tell you the standard slides you need for an investor deck. Problem, solution, opportunity, go to market, business model, financials, tech, timeline, team, competition, ask.</description>
