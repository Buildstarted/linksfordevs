      <title>.NET Rocks! Sustainable Development with Lea Mladineo</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1873</link>
      <description>How do we make our software greener? While at NDC in Porto, Carl and Richard talked to Lea Mladineo about her work in sustainable development. Lea talks about the impact of digital technology on the environment and how, with some thought and effort, we can make a real difference to that impact. The conversation explores how cloud computing can worsen the problem - or better! Software efficiency can reduce the number of cycles needed to complete a task, which is good for the environment and could save your organization money!</description>

      <description>This year I have been involved in running performance benchmarks of Aeron over at Adaptive on two major cloud providers. I learned quite a few things about the arcane arts science craft of running performance benchmarks.
When benchmarking a piece of software, you really want to get the best performance out of it, which is to say that you also want to run it under the best conditions in order to see what is possible.</description>

When I joined Google it was Kim. When I moved to product, Marissa &amp;amp; Brian. Then to Redpoint, it was the early stage team : Geoff, Tim, Chris, &amp;amp; Scott. Lloyd &amp;amp; Frank at Looker for their Series A. Today, it’s the team &amp;amp; the LPs at Theory.
That’s the very beginning of the list.</description>

      <description>For a long time after moving my website from Netlify to Azure, none of my fancy emoji or weird umlaut characters would display properly. Today I fixed that by popping back into the the Hugo theme I built off of minimum-viable-hugo and adding
&amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;&amp;gt; to themes/minimum-viable-hugo/layouts/index.html and themes/minimum-viable-hugo/layouts/partial/head.html. (There’s probably a way to intimidate Azure Static Web Apps into using UTF-8 by default too, but I didn’t bother to look.</description>

      <title>Cairo&amp;#39;s public memory</title>
      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/603/cairos-public-memory/</link>
      <description>Here are some notes on how the Cairo zkVM encodes its (public) memory in the AIR (arithmetization) of the STARK.

      <description>Here&amp;#39;s some notes on how STARK works, following my read of the ethSTARK Documentation (thanks Bobbin for the pointer!).

Warning: the following explanation should look surprisingly close to PlonK or SNARKs in general, to anyone familiar with these other schemes. If you know PlonK, maybe you can think of STARKs as turboplonk without preprocessing and without copy constraints/permutation. Just turbo ...</description>
