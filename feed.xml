      <title>What a good debugger can do</title>
      <link>https://werat.dev/blog/what-a-good-debugger-can-do/</link>
      <description>


When people say “debuggers are useless and using logging and unit-tests is much better,” I suspect many of them think that debuggers can only put breakpoints on certain lines, step-step-step through the code, and check variable values. While any reasonable debugger can indeed do all of that, it’s only the tip of the iceberg. Think about it; we could already step through the code 40 years ago, surely some things have changed?
Tl;dr – in this episode of old-man-yells-at-cloud, you will learn that a good debugger supports different kinds of breakpoints, offers rich data visualization capabilities, has a REPL for executing expressions, can show the dependencies between threads and control their execution, can pick up changes in the source code and apply them without restarting the program, can step through the code backward and rewind the program state to any point in history, and can even record the entire program execution and visualize control flow and data flow history.
I should mention that the perfect debugger doesn’t exist. Different tools support different features and have different limitations. As usual, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, but it’s important to understand what’s theoretically possible and what we should strive for. In this article, I will describe different debugging features and techniques and discuss the existing tools/products that offer them.

Disclaimer. In this article I mention various free and commercial products as examples. I’m not being paid or incentivised in any other way by the companies behind those products (although I will not say no to free swag should they decide to send me some cough-cough). My goal is to raise awareness and challenge the popular belief that “debuggers are useless, let’s just printf”.

      <description>The title might come of as hyperbole but it&amp;#39;s really true.
I&amp;#39;ll explain.
A few years ago, NYSED created a certification area for computer science. At Hunter, we&amp;#39;ve been running our certificate program for the past three years and taking current teachers and qualifying them to earn this new certification. This past Fall, NYSED finalized it&amp;#39;s grandfathering position and just the other day it opened up the portal to allow teachers to sign up.</description>

      <title>Wrangling JSON Arrays: Zed vs SQL</title>
      <link>https://www.brimdata.io/blog/wrangling-json-arrays-with-zed/</link>
      <description>Arrays are prevalent in programming languages, NoSQL databases, and storage formats like JSON and YAML. However, most table-based systems were not designed to handle them. Storing arrays usually requires an extension and querying them with SQL is awkward. You certainly don’t want to export them to a CSV.
The Zed data model was designed to harness the power of both relational tables and schema-less objects. Let’s see how it handles arrays.</description>

      <description>Your car is perfect until you see your neighbor’s.
Everything seems good enough, but then you see an ad or your Instagram feed and wish you had that beautiful desk instead of the perfectly fine one you’re using.
“If only I had that new thing.”
“If only I could go to that beautiful place.”
