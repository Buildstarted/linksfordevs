      <title>The One About Giving &amp; Receiving Feedback</title>
      <link>https://dariagrudzien.com/posts/the-one-about-giving-and-receiving-feedback/</link>
      <description>Or How To Develop Yourself The Hard Way.
 For a long time I’ve been interested in the topic of feedback—learning from others things that allow us to grow and develop ourselves, as well as improve our cooperation with other people. Recently I’ve been wondering why it’s so rare for people in my culture (Central/Eastern Europe) to share feedback—it’s particularly surprising to me when people struggle finding things to praise for. Giving someone positive feedback feels like such an easy way to do something nice for the person, to make them feel appreciated.
My conclusion is that both giving and receiving honest feedback requires us to open up, cut through our armour all the way to our guts and become vulnerable to the other person.</description>

      <title>my love letter to redo</title>
      <link>https://fzakaria.com/2020/06/08/my-love-letter-to-redo.html</link>
      <description>This is a public love letter to redo &amp; the joy it brings building software. I remember when I first finished The Little Schemer and wrote my first semi useful “JSON Diff” program. I was exalted. I was elated. I was ecstatic. There is something magical when you learn Lisp that is really tough to convey over a blog post or short article. One must try it, to grok it. I have not professionally used Lisp much since however it’s been immensely impactful in the way I think about &amp; construct software. Redo is this for build systems.</description>

      <description>One of the most narrow pieces of feedback I give to people being promoted to manager is simple - don’t joke about firing people. When I deliver this feedback people will often respond with some form of befuddlement: “I wasn’t planning to”, “Ummm….OK”, “Obviously”. However, this feedback is driven by knowledge of mistakes made by a number of new managers.</description>

      <title>Create diagrams with code using Graphviz</title>
      <link>https://ncona.com/2020/06/create-diagrams-with-code-using-graphviz/</link>
      <description>Have you ever had to draw an architecture diagram and found the repetitive clicking and dragging tedious? Did you have to do modifications to that diagram and found it complicated?

Graphviz is an open source graph visualization software that allows us to decribe a diagram using code, and have it automatically drawn for us. If the diagram needs to be modified in the future, we just need to modify the description and the nodes and edges will be repositioned automatically for us.

Drawing graphs

Before we start writing graphs, we need to learn how we can convert our code into an image so we can test what we are doing.

      <description>This spring (2020) MIT moved all its classes online 
because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  It made available 
licenses for various nonfree programs, but I objected 
to them on grounds of principle.  For my class, an 
advanced class in computer programming, I made 
arrangements to avoid suggesting any nonfree software 
to my students.</description>

      <title>.NET Today and Tomorrow | Strangelights</title>
      <link>https://www.strangelights.com/posts/archive/2020/06/11/dotnet-today-and-tomorrow.html</link>
      <description>
Recently a conversation made me think about the current state of .NET. Someone from outside the .NET community asked me if .NET ran on Linux. The answer is that .NET has great cross platform support, running on Windows, Linux, maxOS, Android, iOS, WebAssembly, but I can see why someone from outside .NET might think that it didn't.

There are still a few nuance when it comes to cross platform support in the .NET world, but I think that's true of most development platforms today. This post aims to explain those nuances.

      <description>A common feature in cloud APIs is paging for list results. Result sets may be massive - you could have thousands of blobs in a container, for example. Getting all results at once can cause delays in transmission and excessive load on the backend, and might even be so big it won't fit into memory in ...</description>

      <description>API versioning is a way to conform with the Postel's law. Jon Postel wrote this law in an early specification of TCP:

Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others
Jon Postel

This means that you must be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept. Once you have published a
version of your API, you cannot change the format of the data it sends to the clients.…</description>
