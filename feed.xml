      <title>Problems I no longer have by using Server-side rendering</title>
      <link>https://www.wimdeblauwe.com/blog/2024/12/31/problems-i-no-longer-have-by-using-server-side-rendering/</link>
      <description>
I really like to use Spring Boot, Thymeleaf and htmx for a productive web application stack.
However, most of my day-to-day work involves writing REST API backends (Well, JSON Data APIs really) for Angular or React frontends.
During that work, I sometimes can’t help but think “We would not have this issue we are discussing now if we had used server-side rendering instead of a JavaScript Single Page Application.”.
This blog explains some of those thoughts in more detail.

      <description>Why backprop was resisted for 20 years: assumption of discretely spiking neurons, goal of synthesizing Boolean logic, fear of local optima, and bad luck. Werbos has the best claim for invention.</description>

      <title>Daniel Skogly&amp;#39;s blog | Feeding Ducks</title>
      <link>https://blog.klungo.no/2024/12/31/feeding-ducks/</link>
      <description>I used to think that feeding ducks was an act of kindness. It certainly felt like it—just pure, selfless giving with nothing expected in return, except, of course, that warm and fuzzy feeling of having done something good. Parents bringing their kids along for this surely aim to teach them something virtuous, perhaps leading many of us to accept it by default.</description>

      <description>We’re proud to announce the new feature release of darktable, 5.0.0!
The github release is here: https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.0.0.

      <title>12 Months, 12 Books: My Yearlong Journey to Learn, Grow, and Level Up - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/12-months-12-books-my-yearlong-journey-to-learn-grow-and-level-up/</link>
      <description>As we enter a new year, I’m focusing on personal and professional growth as a developer. The tech industry evolves at breakneck speed, and staying ahead requires more than mastering the latest tools and frameworks. To truly excel, developers must dive deep into their craft, exploring timeless programming principles, leadership, collaboration, and personal development. With their ability to distill the wisdom of experienced professionals, books remain one of the best ways to gain these insights. That’s why I’ve set a personal goal for 2025: to read one transformative book each month.</description>

      <description>The Game Boy Advance is an interesting game console. It has a modern-style CPU (32-bit ARM, lots of registers), but uses an old-fashioned tile based renderer like how the NES did it in the 80s. Don’t get me wrong, since its one of Nintendo’s last tile-based systems, they took the idea as far as it can go with fancy features like affine transformations, transparency, and effects applied to sprites. But at its core, it occupies a very unique space:</description>
