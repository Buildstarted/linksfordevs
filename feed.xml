      <title>It&amp;#39;s tough being an Azure fan</title>
      <link>https://www.alexhudson.com/2021/09/17/its-tough-being-an-azure-fan/</link>
      <description>Azure has never been the #1 cloud provider - that spot continues to belong
to AWS, which is the category leader. However, in most people’s minds, it has
been a pretty reasonable #2, and while not necessarily vastly differentiated
from AWS there are enough things to write home about.
However, even as a user and somewhat of a fan of the Azure technology, it is
proving increasing difficult to recommend.</description>

      <title>A New Dawn of Learning</title>
      <link>https://leesjensen.com/learning/manifesto.html</link>
      <description>Enabling individuals to maximize their potential and contributions is a key component of global prosperity and peace. Outdated educational models where formative years are devoted to obtaining a standard set of knowledge with the goal of entering lifelong employment fall short in a globally connected world where technologies, skills, and opportunities rapidly fluctuate. We need a system that allows for the rapid learning of desired skills in anticipation of, and in response to, the immediate needs of markets and individuals.</description>

      <description>There is no shortage of package managers.  Each tool makes its own set
of tradeoffs regarding speed, ease of use, customizability, and
reproducibility.  Guix occupies a sweet spot,

      <title>A different kind of keyboard</title>
      <link>https://ianthehenry.com/posts/peggi/</link>
      <description>

I’ve always been attracted to chording keyboards in theory, but I lack whatever childhood musical training is required to wrap my fingers around them.
So I made something else: an arpeggio keyboard.
Peggi is an eight-key keyboard that fits on the back of your phone. While chording keyboards require you to press multiple keys at the same time, arpeggio keyboards only ask that you type multiple keys in sequence.</description>
