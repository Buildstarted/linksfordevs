      <title>The Strange Path of Accepting How Your Brain Works &amp;#183; Caffeinspiration</title>
      <link>https://alexanderell.is/posts/limitations/</link>
      <description>I recently read Turing’s Cathedral, a book about the early history of computers, and it largely focused on the life and brilliant times of John von Neumann, who was, to put it simply, a genius. It is both fascinating and disappointing to learn about a brain that works so much better than your own.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Piano Practice — Fundamentals of Piano Practice</title>
      <link>https://fundamentals-of-piano-practice.readthedocs.io/</link>
      <description>This is the best book ever written on how to practice at the piano! Most books
list what skills are needed (scales, arpeggios, trills, etc.), but not how to
acquire them. This book teaches how to solve technical problems, step by step.
Learn practice methods, how to acquire technique and memorize hours of
repertoire, sight reading, musical playing, relaxation, etc., and, most
importantly, Mental Play in which you learn to play the piano in your mind.
Mental play touches every aspect of piano playing, from memorizing, controlling
nervousness, developing performance skills, playing musically, etc., to
acquiring absolute pitch, composing and improvisation. It is almost
unbelievable that such an essential skill has been mostly neglected by piano
teachers. All great musicians used it, yet even they often failed to teach it.
We learn why the traditional methods of teaching piano widely used today are
the reasons why students give up piano.</description>
