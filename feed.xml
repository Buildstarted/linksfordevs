      <title>Why I Chose Common Lisp — Dan&amp;#39;s Musings</title>
      <link>https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/why-i-chose-common-lisp/</link>
      <description>After ~7 years, I was done with Clojure. I was writing a some
CLI
apps, and I hated how long they took to
start up. The community at large seemed not to care about this problem, except
for the babashka folks. However, I spent
long, hard hours banging my head against
native-image
and it just wasn&amp;#39;t working out. It was incredibly painful, and at the end of it,
I still didn&amp;#39;t have standalone, fast-starting native executables. I decided that
that was a requirement for my main driving hobby language, and that Clojure didn&amp;#39;t
have it. It was then that I decided to move on from Clojure.</description>

      <title>Why is hash(-1) == hash(-2) in Python?</title>
      <link>https://omairmajid.com/posts/2021-07-16-why-is-hash-in-python/</link>
      <description>While browsing Reddit the other day waiting for my code to compile , I ran across this question on r/Python:
 is hash(-1) == hash(-2) an easter egg?  Wait, is that really true?
$ python Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 29 2021, 00:00:00) [GCC 11.1.1 20210531 (Red Hat 11.1.1-3)] on linux Type &amp;quot;help&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;credits&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;license&amp;quot; for more information. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hash(-1) -2 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hash(-2) -2 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; hash(-1) == hash(-2) True Yes, it is.</description>

      <title>Server-Side Socket Programming Explained – Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/handling-complexity-server-side-socket-programming-explained/</link>
      <description>Handling server-side socket programming is like orchestrating a digital symphony.&amp;#160;While the client starts the conversation,&amp;#160;the server is the conductor,&amp;#160;managing multiple requests,&amp;#160;coordinating responses,&amp;#160;and ensuring everything stays in harmony.&amp;#160;Server-side programming is a mix of art and science—it’s about balancing responsiveness,&amp;#160;scalability,&amp;#160;and reliability.&amp;#160;Let’s break it down and make sense of the complexity.</description>

      <description>Attached: 1 image

Thinking of Aaron Swartz today &amp;amp; I’m stuck on this photo - he &amp;amp; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (both circled) each scraped 1000s of docs but one did it to make the knowledge free for all while the other did it to make $$$$ through probabilistic plagiarism. The US DOJ only came after one of them &amp;amp; the other is feted by tech bros and executives.

Thank you Aaron for so much, for RSS, for Markdown, for Creative Commons and more. I’m sorry our society failed you.</description>

      <title>De-smarting the Marshall Uxbridge</title>
      <link>https://tomscii.sig7.se/2025/01/De-smarting-the-Marshall-Uxbridge</link>
      <description>This is the story of a commercially unavailable stereo pair of the
bi-amped Marshall Uxbridge, with custom-built replacement electronics:
active filters feeding two linear power amps. Listening to this
high-fidelity set has brought me immense enjoyment. Play a great album
on these near-fields, and the result is close to pure magic! Over and
above the accurate reproduction of a wide audio range, the precision
and depth of its stereo imaging is stunning.</description>

      <title>Exploring ways to optimize compute shaders - Part 1.</title>
      <link>https://frguthmann.github.io/posts/compute_shaders/</link>
      <description>In this post we’ll be looking at compute shaders, profiling tools and failed experiments to improve performance. This is my journey learning compute shaders first through WebGPU and then Vulkan. My goal was to implement Conway’s Game Of Life algorithm in a brute force manner and to make it run as fast as possible on the GPU .
This will not be a tutorial on how to setup compute shaders.</description>

      <description>What Passive Income Really Means: It’s not about money magically dropping into your bank account. Instead, it’s about uncoupling your income from your daily working hours. Picture writing a book or developing a piece of software once and continuing to earn from it long after it’s completed.</description>

      <title>WordPress is in trouble</title>
      <link>https://anderegg.ca/2025/01/11/wordpress-is-in-trouble</link>
      <description>Since I last wrote about WordPress, things have gone off the rails. This after a brief period when things were blissfully quiet. Matt Mullenweg stopped commenting for a while, though his company had launched WP Engine Tracker — a site for tracking WordPress-driven websites that moved away from WP Engine. I think this is a bit gauche, but it seems like fair marketing given everything that’s going on. It should be noted that many sites are leaving for Pressable — owned by Mullenweg’s company, Automattic —&amp;#160;because of a sweetheart deal.</description>
