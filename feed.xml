      <title>How to properly manage ssh keys for server access :: Päpper's Coding Blog — Have fun coding.</title>
      <link>https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/how-to-properly-manage-ssh-keys-for-server-access/</link>
      <description>Every developer needs access to some servers for example to check the application logs.
Usually, this is done using public-private key encryption where each developer generates their own public-private key pair. The public keys of each developer are added to the authorized_keys file on each server they should have access to.
Painful manual changes So far so good. However, what happens when one developer leaves the company?
In that case, the public keys of that developer should be removed from all servers.</description>

scdoc, and it gave them a SIGSEGV back.
Diving into this problem gave me a good opportunity to draw a comparison between
musl libc and glibc. Let’s start with the stack trace:</description>

      <title>SQLite Is Dynamically Typed</title>
      <link>https://blog.zachwf.com/posts/sqlite-is-dynamically-typed/</link>
      <description>A small, cool fact about SQLite is that its columns are flexibly typed. You can store any value in any column! Try it out:
sqlite&gt; create table t1 (v1 int, v2 varchar(10)); sqlite&gt; insert into t1 values ("abc", "this string is longer than 10 characters!"); sqlite&gt; select * from t1; abc|this string is longer than 10 characters! sqlite&gt; select typeof(v1), typeof(v2) from t1; text|text The null type is still special:</description>
