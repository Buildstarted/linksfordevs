      <title>Onboarding roulette: deleting our employee accounts daily</title>
      <link>https://graphite.dev/blog/onboarding-roulette</link>
      <description>I’m a strong believer in automated tests - and a moderately disciplined author of them. Software engineering is exceptionally hard to get functionally correct, and even harder to avoid regressing later. As my wise teammate Dave says, “Legacy code is any code that doesn’t have a test.”</description>

A combination that eats up any free time if I’m not intentional. How do I make time for what I care about, and keep my sanity? The surprising answer is I make use of lost minutes. But what is a lost minute? Someday is today It all started when I read Someday is today by Matthew Dicks. The tagline is “22 Simple, Actionable Ways to Propel Your Creative Life”.

      <title>Why Databases Won&amp;#39;t Charge for Storage in the Future by @ttunguz</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/why-databases-wont-charge-storage/</link>
      <description>The database is being unbundled. Historically, a database like Snowflake sold both data storage &amp;amp; a query engine (&amp;amp; the computing power to execute the query). That’s step 1 above.
But, customers are pushing for a deeper separation of compute &amp;amp; storage. The recent Snowflake earnings call highlighted the trend. Larger customers prefer open formats for interoperability (step 2 &amp;amp; 3).
A lot of big customers want to have open file formats to give them the options…So data interoperability is very much a thing and our AI products can generally act on data that is sitting in cloud storage as well.</description>

      <title>NumPy vs BLAS: Losing 90% of Throughput</title>
      <link>https://ashvardanian.com/posts/numpy-vs-blas-costs/</link>
      <description>Downloaded over 5 Billion times, NumPy is the most popular library for numerical computing in Python. It wraps low-level HPC libraries like BLAS and LAPACK, providing a high-level interface for matrix operations. BLAS is mainly implemented in C, Fortran, or Assembly and is available for most modern chips, not just CPUs. BLAS is fast, but bindings aren’t generally free. So, how much of the BLAS performance is NumPy leaving on the table?</description>

      <description>I blog sometimes. I publish a good bit of music as well, and yet, no one knows me. This is fine. I happily mosey through life without internet celebrity, but candidly (and probably humanly), it would be nice to get recognition for the things that I make. So how does one get “discovered”? Youtube just recommended me this small linux youtuber, who struck me with a Jimmy Neutron style, brain blast on how these algorithms likely work.</description>
