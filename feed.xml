      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/increase-file-upload-limit-for-aspdotnet</link>
      <description>By default, ASP.NET and IIS protect us from large requests by putting hard limits on the transmitted size. IIS buffers files in our server’s memory before passing the byte array to ASP.NET. IIS’ default limit is 4MB and ASP.NET Core has a default of 30MB. To put that in perspective, one 12 megapixels digital picture can average 3.6 megabytes.</description>

      <description>Please donate! https://bit.ly/DATS2020

We are bringing together technologists, from all backgrounds and from around the globe, with two important goals in mind: to raise awareness and provide financial support for the many people fighting the current coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic, while also delivering hope and reconnecting those in our global developer community.

Dev Around The Sun is a cross-platform, language-agnostic event, with high-level tech talks, as well as human skills talks. We have renowned speakers from a broad set of communities, spanning many technologies and all continents, who will educate, entertain, and inspire our international audience in the comfort of their own homes.

We want to ensure that no matter who you are and what role technology plays in your life, you have the opportunity to take part in a very important cause during these times, while at the same time being part of a vast community of people with shared interests.

By collecting funds via attendee contributions, corporate sponsorships, and matching donations, we will all be able to give back to those affected by this crisis, with the hope that folks taking part in this event will be able contribute in any way they can.

Our schedule of speakers is available on the website: https://devaroundthesun.org/schedule</description>

      <title>A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020/index.htm</link>
      <description>These six brief videos, recorded in 2020, contain ideas and suggestions from Professor Strang about the recommended order of topics in teaching and learning linear algebra. The first topic is called A New Way to Start Linear Algebra. The key point is to start right in with the columns of a matrix A and the multiplication Ax that combines those columns.That leads to The Column Space of a Matrix and the idea of independent columns and the factorization A = CR that tells so much about A.  With good numbers, every student can see dependent columns.The remaining videos outline very briefly the full course: The Big Picture of Linear Algebra; Orthogonal Vectors; Eigenvalues &amp;amp; Eigenvectors; and Singular Values &amp;amp; Singular Vectors.  Singular values have become so important and they come directly from the eigenvalues of A'A.You can see this new idea developing in the first video lecture of Professor Strang&amp;rsquo;s 2019 course 18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning.</description>

      <description>Memory and performance are tightly coupled to each other in .NET. If you don’t create a “garbage collector friendly” application, you’ll have performance problems. In extreme cases, those problem turn into memory pressure, also known as GC pressure.
