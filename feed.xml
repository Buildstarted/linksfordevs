      <link>https://mht.wtf/post/aicohol/</link>
      <description>The ethics1 of LLMs is a contentious topic.
I think this is mainly because of the current reach of the technology (it's everywhere),
the hype (people claim it can do anything),
and that it's succesful (it's hard to ignore).
Unfortunately, a lot of things are mixed into disussions around the ethics of LLMs,
and so I've struggeled with figuring out what I think.</description>

      <title>Two And A Half Years In GameDev</title>
      <link>https://smyachenkov.com/posts/two-and-half-years-in-gamedev/</link>
      <description>About 3 years ago, I joined a GameDev company, without any prior experience making games or hands-on exposure to this industry.
Statistically, this time is not even enough to release a single game. But during that window, I was lucky to meet many talented people deeply involved in modern GameDev, who shared with me their career journeys, war tales, and anecdotes, and helped me shape my vision.
One unexpected outcome of this switch was that many friends and former colleagues reached out to me curious about what it was like and how it is comparable to my previous experiences. A surprising amount of them revealed to me that they were secretly planning to pursue this path later in their career, or explore it as a passion project.</description>

      <title>💣Making Explainable Minesweeper</title>
      <link>https://sublevelgames.github.io/blogs/2025-07-06-making-explainable-minesweeper/</link>
      <description>Many Minesweeper situations that seem like 50/50 luck are actually solvable through logical deduction. Inspired by ‘14 Minesweeper Variants,’ I created ‘Explainable Minesweeper’ - a game that generates only logically solvable puzzles and explains the reasoning in natural language.</description>

      <title>Speed Up Django Queries with values() over only()</title>
      <link>https://johnnymetz.com/posts/django-values-over-only/</link>
      <description>If your Django queries feel slow, the problem might not be your database — it might be your ORM. Recently, I was working with a query that took 25 seconds to run through the Django ORM, but the underlying SQL completed in just 2 seconds. With a single change, I got the ORM query down to 2 seconds as well — and reduced the memory footprint by 70%.
Let’s walk through what happened, and why using .values() instead of .only() can dramatically improve performance.</description>
