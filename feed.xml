      <title>Designing Personal Software</title>
      <link>https://alexsci.com/blog/personal-apps/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about the type of software I want to build and use.
    I spend so much of my screen time using large feature-heavy software, which are one-size-fits-none at best or outright hostile.
    I&amp;#39;m left frustrated, distracted, and wanting something better.</description>

      <title>That will never change. Not here.</title>
      <link>https://jimmyhmiller.github.io/never-change</link>
      <description>I remember starting my first job, excited that this hobby I had as a kid could pay so well. 55k, more than double what my parents had ever made. Diving into code written by other people for the first time was exciting. Hundreds of thousands of lines of hastily written code, a lot of C# some VB, every javascript framework that had ever existed, and a sprinkling of Delphi. To me at 20 years old, the whole thing felt like possibilities. So much we could do and change. So much to improve. But quickly I found out how wrong I was:</description>

      <title>AAC and Debian</title>
      <link>https://tookmund.com/2024/02/aac-and-debian</link>
      <description>Currently, in a default installation of Debian with the GNOME desktop,
Bluetooth headphones that require the AAC codec1 cannot be used.
As the Debian wiki outlines,
using the AAC codec over Bluetooth, while technically supported by
PipeWire, is explicitly disabled in Debian at this time.
This is because the fdk-aac library needed to enable this support is currently
in the non-free component of the repository, meaning that PipeWire, which
is in the main component, cannot depend on it.


  
    
      Such as, for example, any Apple AirPods, which only support AAC AFAICT.&amp;#160;↩

      <title>Hallucination is Inevitable: An Innate Limitation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11817</link>
      <description>Hallucination has been widely recognized to be a significant drawback for large language models (LLMs). There have been many works that attempt to reduce the extent of hallucination. These efforts have mostly been empirical so far, which cannot answer the fundamental question whether it can be completely eliminated. In this paper, we formalize the problem and show that it is impossible to eliminate hallucination in LLMs. Specifically, we define a formal world where hallucination is defined as inconsistencies between a computable LLM and a computable ground truth function. By employing results from learning theory, we show that LLMs cannot learn all of the computable functions and will therefore always hallucinate. Since the formal world is a part of the real world which is much more complicated, hallucinations are also inevitable for real world LLMs. Furthermore, for real world LLMs constrained by provable time complexity, we describe the hallucination-prone tasks and empirically validate our claims. Finally, using the formal world framework, we discuss the possible mechanisms and efficacies of existing hallucination mitigators as well as the practical implications on the safe deployment of LLMs.</description>

      <title>ARCHITECTURE.md</title>
      <link>https://matklad.github.io/2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html</link>
      <description>If you maintain an open-source project in the range of 10k-200k lines of code, I strongly encourage you to add an ARCHITECTURE document next to README and CONTRIBUTING.
Before going into the details of why and how, I want to emphasize that this is not another docs are good, write more docs advice.
I am pretty sloppy about documentation, and, e.g., I often use just simplify as a commit message.
Nonetheless, I feel strongly about the issue, even to the point of pestering you :-)</description>
