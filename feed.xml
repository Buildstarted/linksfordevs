      <title>Building an AI-Powered .NET API with Ollama and Microsoft.Extensions.AI</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=5toMey7kxv0</link>
      <description>The integration of AI capabilities into .NET applications has become more accessible with Microsoft&amp;#39;s release of the Microsoft.Extensions.AI package. This tutorial demonstrates how to build an intelligent API that leverages Ollama&amp;#39;s Large Language Models (LLMs) and implements custom function calling.

      <title>A Gentle Introduction to LLMs for Platform Engineers</title>
      <link>https://blog.christianposta.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-llms-for-platform-engineers/</link>
      <description>Things change quickly in the land of technology. AI is the “hot” thing. I feel for the platform engineers out there struggling with technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Istio, ArgoCD, Zipkin, Backstage.io, and many many others. Those things are already confusing, complex, and require deep attention. These folks don’t have time or attention to dig into AI and what’s going on in that space. But little by little AI will land in their world. Platform engineers will need to understand AI.

      <description>Ever wonder who changed what and when in your database? Or maybe you’ve had that “uh-oh” moment where data was updated, but no one knows how? Good news: EF Core has a built-in way to track changes—without modifying every query manually! SaveChanges Interception lets you hook into EF Core’s SaveChanges() pipeline and log inserts, updates, and deletes automatically.</description>
