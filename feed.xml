      <title>Different Communication Styles in Software Engineering - Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=aPJRTB8vMYQ</link>
      <description>Unfortunately, the loudest voices in the room are the ones that get heard. And it's not just because they're loud -- it's because we too often don't consider other communication styles for software engineers.

Let's see how we can make some small adjustments to accommodate others!

As with all livestreams, I'm looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.

      <description>It has been a while since I setup my original router for my 25gbit internet connection. I decided it was time to upgrade but since I have some services running I did not want to be down for too long and purchased some new hardware which would allow me to experiment with VyOS without effecting my current setup.</description>

      <description>In-depth look at CRDs and how they work under the hood
Today, we are going to walk through how a CRD looks like, what it does, what it contains, how it works and how it alters Kubernetes.
The design, the api extension and links and snippets to the code ( accurate at the time of writing ) where it happens.
Let‚Äôs dive in.
What are CRDs
CRDs as described in the official Kubernetes Documentation page are objects that can extend the API of Kubernetes.</description>

      <title>Streamlining Web App Development With Zeroconf</title>
      <link>https://blog.julik.nl/2025/05/dev-subdomains-with-zeroconf</link>
      <description>The sites which are using Shardine do not only have separate data storage - they all have their own domain names. I frequently need to validate that every site is able to work correctly with the changes I am making. At Cheddar we are also using multiple domains, which is a good security practice due to CORS and CSP. Until recently I didn‚Äôt really have a good setup for developing with multiple domains, but that has changed - and the setup I ended up with works really, really well. So, let‚Äôs dive in - it could work just as well for you too! The problem of multiple hostnames When you have an application (let‚Äôs assume it is a Rails application, for simplicity) and you run bin/rails s or bin/dev the app boots and binds to localhost:127.0.0.1. It means that it will respond on requests to your localhost IP only (regardless of which domain name is used), and it usually runs on port 3000 - which is a Rails default. When you have multiple subdomains and you want to test them, the standard approach is editing your /etc/hosts and adding the following segment to it: 127.0.0.1 myapp-site1 127.0.0.1 myapp-site2 127.0.0.1 myapp-site3 You then need to flush your DNS caches and change the Puma config to bind not to localhost but to your link-local IP instead: bind "tcp://0.0.0.0:3000" This is so that Puma listens not only to localhost but to any request that comes in to your link-local IP. This approach works, but it has some disadvantages. First, you need to edit your /etc/hosts and add (or remove) every app‚Äôs domains that you are working on. This is annoying and wasteful. Second, you can encounter problems with .local, .home and .example TLDs if you use them - so you may bump into your DNS lookups taking 5 seconds Also, the /etc/hosts approach only makes these new names resolvable on the machine the app is running on. It is fine as long as you do not want to test your site on a mobile device, for example - a very valid use case! You want to open your app on your smartphone and examine the mobile-optimized layout, for example - as well as test the JS-heavy bits that may be slow on mobile. But just resolving to localhost will not allow your device to access your workstation where the app is running! You can also use .lvh.me which gives you a DNS resolution to 127.0.0.1 for anything you throw at it. This removes the need to edit /etc/hosts but introduces another big problem. Some ISPs will actually filter out any DNS responses that you receive which resolve to 127.0.0.1 - this is called DNS rebinding protection and one of the dominant ISPs here in the Netherlands does it so heavy-handedly and badly that even if you configure your own DNS servers their responses get filtered out as well. This manifests as another severe DNS timeout when you try to access locally-bound hosts. And the only remedy for this is‚Ä¶ adding those hosts to your /ect/hosts. Bah.</description>

      <title>Insane malware hidden with invisible Unicode and Google Calendar invites!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=N8dHa2b-I5A</link>
      <description>In this video, we uncover one of the most bizarre and sophisticated supply chain attacks we‚Äôve seen so far ‚Äî involving Unicode PUA characters, base64 obfuscation, and Google Calendar invites as malware delivery vehicles. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

üîç What we found:

An NPM package called os-info-checker-es6 hiding malicious logic behind invisible characters.
Use of eval(atob(...)) patterns to silently execute obfuscated code.
Malware delivered through a Google Calendar link embedded in a fake package update.
A payload delivery chain that uses base64 strings encoded inside calendar event titles to fetch malicious domains.

‚ö†Ô∏è What makes this even scarier? This package has dependents that look professional, giving the attack a supply chain infection vector. The attackers seem to be preparing for a large-scale deployment... but we caught them in the act.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), technical deep dive, and decoded examples are all covered in this video.

üõ°Ô∏è Stay safe, stay vigilant‚Äîand don‚Äôt trust every NPM package!
