      <title>When (not) to write an Apache APISIX plugin</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/when-write-apisix-plugin/</link>
      <description>When I introduce Apache APISIX in my talks, I mention the massive number of existing plugins, and that each of them implements a specific feature. One of the key features of Apache APISIX is its flexibility. If a feature is missing, you can create your own plugin in Lua or a language compiled into Wasm, showcasing the platform’s adaptability to your specific needs. In this post, I aim to provide practical alternatives to writing a custom plugin, offering solutions you can quickly implement </description>

      <title>How to Hire a CTO</title>
      <link>https://www.khoslaventures.com/how-to-hire-a-cto/</link>
      <description>The senior-most technology focused executive at a tech startup is a make-or-break hire. They set the technical vision of your product based on feasibility and ambition. At the seed stage this person will create the first version of your product and iterate until you achieve product-market fit. During the growth stage this individual will be responsible for the majority of your raised capital in the form of engineering headcount. Across all stages your CTO may be the difference in the race to deploy effective AI for your customers or a successful hardware launch. And like any executive they should make everyone else better at their jobs.</description>

      <title>Why Solid?</title>
      <link>https://noeldemartin.com/blog/why-solid</link>
      <description>For five years, I&amp;#39;ve dedicated most of my side-project time to making apps and tools using the Solid Protocol. Many share its vision, but it&amp;#39;s also common to hear criticisms. I&amp;#39;m often asked why I&amp;#39;m still working on Solid, or told about another project that is doing a better job at solving similar problems.
Today, I&amp;#39;ll go through some of the criticisms, share my own concerns, and answer why after all these years I&amp;#39;m still choosing Solid.
