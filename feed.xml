      <title>DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948</link>
      <description>We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.</description>

      <link>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/javascript-temporal-is-coming/</link>
      <description>A new way to handle dates and times is being added to JavaScript. Let&amp;#39;s take a look at Temporal, what problems it solves, the current state, and what you&amp;#39;ll find in the new documentation about it on MDN.

      <title>DbContext Pooling: The Secret Sauce to Faster EF Core Apps - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/dbcontext-pooling-the-secret-sauce-to-faster-ef-core-apps/</link>
      <description>Imagine you’re running a restaurant. Every time a customer orders, you buy a brand-new frying pan, use it once, and toss it out. Sounds absurd, right? But that’s essentially what happens in EF Core when you create a new DbContext for every request. It’s wasteful, slow, and totally unnecessary. Enter DbContext Pooling: the genius way to reuse those frying pans—err, contexts—and turbocharge your app’s performance.</description>

      <title>TB</title>
      <link>https://yasserarg.com/tb</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;m Yasser and I&amp;#39;ve made it my mission to produce an alternative to LLVM, the current
king of compiler backend libraries. I&amp;#39;m calling it Tilde (or TB for tilde backend) and the reasons
are pretty simple, i believe it&amp;#39;s far too slow at compiling and far too big to be fixed from the
inside. It&amp;#39;s been 20 years and cruft has built up, time for a &amp;quot;redo&amp;quot;.</description>

      <title>The Mythical IO-Bound Rails App</title>
      <link>https://byroot.github.io/ruby/performance/2025/01/23/the-mythical-io-bound-rails-app.html</link>
      <description>When the topic of Rails performance comes up, it is commonplace to hear that the database is the bottleneck, so Rails applications are IO-bound anyway, hence Ruby performance doesn’t matter that much, and all you need is a healthy dose of concurrency to make your service scale. But how true is this in general?</description>
