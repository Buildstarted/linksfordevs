      <title>Up to 4GB of memory in WebAssembly ¬∑ V8</title>
      <link>https://v8.dev/blog/4gb-wasm-memory</link>
      <description>Thanks to recent work in Chrome and Emscripten, you can now use up to 4GB of memory in WebAssembly applications. That‚Äôs up from the previous limit of 2GB. It might seem odd that there was ever a limit - after all, no work was needed to allow people to use 512MB or 1GB of memory! - but it turns out that there are some special things happening in the jump from 2GB to 4GB, both in the browser and in the toolchain, which we‚Äôll describe in this post.</description>
