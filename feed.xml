      <title>Apple&amp;#39;s app review team (Accessible Hangman)</title>
      <link>https://www.applevis.com/forum/accessibility-advocacy/apples-app-review-team-accessible-hangman</link>
      <description>Hi all.
As some of you may know, I am a totally blind iOS game developer. Among other games I have made accessible Hangman, Choose your Face, etc.
Well, about 3 days ago I found out a bug which prevented iOS 15 users from running my game accessible hangman. I submitted an update to the app store fixing this problem. To my surprise, I got an email saying that my app is similar to other apps on the app store and that it is considered spam. Literally.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s common for me to get excited about a personal project, put a bunch of time into it, and then lose interest. As much as possible, I want them to continue working; upkeep isn&amp;#39;t fun. What does designing for minimum maintenance look like?   The biggest piece is minimizing your dependencies, and limiting them to ones that value backwards compatibility. Most of my projects are on the web, which mea</description>
