      <title>Where programs live? Vague spaces and software systems</title>
      <link>https://tomasp.net/blog/2023/vague-spaces/</link>
      <description> Terrain vague in a city is abandoned space without clear purpose. Does it also
exist in programs and can we learn something useful about reading programs and the space in
which program exist from the inter-disciplinary study of terrain vague in cities?</description>

      <description>So we have two questions here: One, how do we draw boundaries around our computer programs such that we minimize the risk of any one concept failing? Two, how do we define any one term such that it is impossible for there to be a misunderstanding or for the program to crash?</description>

      <title>Open Peer Review Considered Harmful?</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2023/peer_review/</link>
      <description>Peer review, one of the staples of modern research, has a somewhat
weird reputation: on the one hand, society recognises that there should
be a way to assess the correctness of scientific claims.1 On the other
hand, researchers are loath to relinquish control to their peers, who,
typically, provide anonymous feedback. This latter opinion is typically
justified by explaining that the incentives2 are not in favour of the
authors here: the default position for many journals and many
conferences seems to be ‘reject unless proven to be sufficiently good,’
meaning that it is much easier for reviewers to suggest
rejection than to engage with the content in a meaningful manner.</description>

      <description>Over the past few years, I’ve seen something that kind of troubles me. While people on iPhones Write books on using the iPhone on their iPhones, clear out their Email on their Apple Watch and manage the rest on their iPhones, and use their iPhones as their primary computing devices, Android users feel like one cannot be productive on any mobile system. So, here’s the thing. When you are around sighted people, even at a job sometimes, what are they using?</description>

      <title>How to Efficiently Reorder or Rerank Items in Database - Yasoob Khalid</title>
      <link>https://yasoob.me/posts/how-to-efficiently-reorder-or-rerank-items-in-database/</link>
      <description>I was once thinking about Trello and Jira and wondered how they implemented the sorting functionality in their drag &amp;amp; drop interface. You can have a million items/cards and both of these platforms will allow you to change the order in a simple drag and drop manner and efficiently update their position in the database.
How could I implement such a system? It was hard to do research on this topic because most queries returned results from blogs that showed how to implement a drag and drop component using React DnD and similar libraries but did not show how to persist the new order in a database.</description>

      <description>Jan Strehmel: We find that open source code containing swearwords exhibit significantly better code quality than those not containing swearwords under several statistical tests. We hypothesise that the use of swearwords constitutes an indicator of a profound emotional involvement of the programmer with the code and its inherent complexities, thus yielding better code based on a thorough, ...</description>
