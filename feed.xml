      <description>If you stumble upon this post, chances are, you were also having a hard time trying to figure out how to configure Azure API Management (APIM) to return the correct StatusCode when a required querystring parameter wasn&amp;#39;t supplied. Well, the short answer is you can&amp;#39;t. Atleast, based on my research</description>

      <title>In praise of depth – Pravesh</title>
      <link>https://prave.sh/2021/06/15/in-praise-of-depth/</link>
      <description>Imagine living in the 1800s. Books were few, libraries were fewer and information was generally hard to come by. If you happened to be a researcher working upon a specific question, chances were that a big portion of your time would have been spent on running between different libraries and gathering different sources for your perusal. All of this changed with the advent of the Internet. Now, researchers don’t run hither and thither for literature in their domain, they just use Google.</description>

      <title>Note taking in 2021 - blog.dornea.nu</title>
      <link>http://blog.dornea.nu/2021/06/13/note-taking-in-2021/</link>
      <description>Almost 6 years ago I was blogging about organizing and visualizing knowledge. At that time I was just playing around with Tiddlywiki and using it to collect notes during my CCNA course. I couldn’t anticipate to which extent personal knowledge management systems would become famous and trendy. And people nowadays don’t blog anymore: They take care of their digital gardens. While most of them seem to be just a collection of random notes, there are actually good ones where you can actually read through the thoughts/notes and learn something new.</description>

      <title>Before you left for vacation</title>
      <link>http://amortizedcost.net/before-you-left-for-vacation/</link>
      <description>Write down all passwords
If you are going to have a long vacation (2+ weeks), most probably you will
forget all of the passwords. Don&amp;#39;t count on your memorizing abilities and write
them down

Push unfinished code
Otherwise, the feature you haven&amp;#39;t finish by the vocation will be blocked by the
fact, that other team members don&amp;#39;t have a copy of your work. Push it and let
other team members know that you&amp;#39;ve done it

Do knowledge transfer
For the same reason as the previous point

Use automatic repl</description>

      <title>The Function Component Mafia</title>
      <link>https://cheatcode.co/opinions/the-function-component-mafia</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you look at the official React docs, on the home page, the first example you see relies on a class-based approach, not a function-based approach. Arguably, this is intentional; not a mistake.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In order to fully understand React, you have to understand what a component lifecycle is. If you start with and only ever work with a function-based approach, you can lose sight of what this means. That&amp;#39;s important because understanding how the lifecycle works can influence certain design decisions in &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;both&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; types of components (and even influence whether or not to use one over the other).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://cheatcode-post-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/RF9FbADL7S1WoJNI/4PYMki8fKl1uIRrZ.0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;RF9FbADL7S1WoJNI/4PYMki8fKl1uIRrZ.0&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;As of writing, the very first examples you see in the React documentation rely on class-based components.&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;#39;s important to understand is that hooks were created to solve a particular problem: the need for adding state (or other &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;stateful&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; functionality, like fetching data) to smaller, function-based components &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;without&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; having to resort to using a class (and bringing in the full weight of React&amp;#39;s lifecycle methods).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming&amp;quot;&amp;gt;cargo-culting&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; around function components and using hooks. This means that for a new learner, what they see in the React documentation vs. what they see &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;other&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; developers doing is contrasting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is confusing. The truth is that, as the React docs reveal in plain words, that &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;both&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; function components and class-based components are valid ways of authoring React components. Where they &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;differ&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; is in their utility and when they&amp;#39;re best applied relative to your application.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Are function components bad? No. They serve a specific purpose. Are hooks bad? No. They serve a specific purpose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What&amp;#39;s &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;bad&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; is that the introduction of these tools brought a &amp;amp;quot;to a man with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail&amp;amp;quot; scenario in tow. Instead of asking &amp;amp;quot;why,&amp;amp;quot; the consensus shifted towards &amp;amp;quot;sure why not, everybody else is doing it!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If all you understand is the hook-based method (or rather, all you &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;see&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; around you is usage of the hook-based method), it&amp;#39;s likely that method is the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;only&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; way you know how to build a React-based UI.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is problematic because it means that you do &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;not&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; know when a function-based approach is better than a class-based approach and vice versa.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That matters because in not knowing, you can create unnecessary messes in your codebase simply by trying to &amp;amp;quot;fit in with what everybody else is doing.&amp;amp;quot; You waste time and energy doing something one way that can be done with the other in half the time and still be a perfectly valid approach.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The way to solve this problem is to develop an understanding of how both methods work and the nuances involved in their usage. This takes practice. You won&amp;#39;t get it right every single time—and you don&amp;#39;t need to—but challenging yourself will ensure you understand &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;why&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; the approach you&amp;#39;re taking is correct.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What you have to avoid is being overly pedantic. There&amp;#39;s nothing more obnoxious than the stickler who says &amp;amp;quot;this is the only way to do this!&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nc9xksGWBU&amp;quot;&amp;gt;freaks out if you &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;don&amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; do it that way&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My advice? Know the territory, work to understand your tools at a deeper level, and allow room for flexibility in your process so that you don&amp;#39;t create unnecessary problems for yourself. It also needs to be said: if you find yourself unnecessarily taking the more complex path to justify your employment, you should re-evaluate your career choices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Europe&amp;#39;s Software Problem - Bert Hubert&amp;#39;s writings</title>
      <link>https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/europes-software-problem/</link>
      <description>Europe’s communication needs are currently almost exclusively delivered by Chinese hardware that connects us to US-based platforms. For a variety of reasons, this is not a good idea.
As stated recently by Charles Michel, President of the European Council, “Interdependence is natural, even desirable. Over-dependence, however, is not”.
   Photo by Sara Kurfe&amp;#223; on Unsplash
   At the core, the problem is that almost no consumer-oriented platforms or software products are being created in Europe, or more precisely, by European companies.</description>

Before the pandemic, I co-wrote a grant to teach Python programming to middle school students using Raspberry Pi computers. Like many other plans, COVID-19 put mine on hold for over a year.

We’ll explain why we (and everybody else) used to believe them, and how things really work. Let’s start this series with the biggest one:</description>

      <title>Bye bye Travis CI | daniel.haxx.se</title>
      <link>https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/06/14/bye-bye-travis-ci/</link>
      <description>In the afternoon of October 17, 2013 we merged the first config file ever that would use Travis CI for the curl project using the nifty integration at GitHub. This was the actual introduction of the entire concept of building and testing the project on every commit and pull request for the curl project. Before this merge happened, we only had our autobuilds. They are systems run by volunteers that update the code from git maybe once per day, build and run the tests and then upload all the logs.</description>
