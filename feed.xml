      <title>.NET Rocks! DoomSharp with Wesley Cabus and Nico Vermeir</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1839</link>
      <description>An MAUI version of Doom? Carl and Richard talk to Wesley Cabus and Nico Vermeir about their efforts to port the venerable game Doom to C# and .NET 6 with MAUI as the UI. Wesley did the base conversion of Doom over to .NET, while Nico focused on getting the UI working through MAUI. Converting code, graphics, music, and sound effects from the 1990s into modern solutions is challenging but fun! Primarily working on the PC, there&amp;#39;s a concerted effort to get a version running on Android devices too - and they could use your help!</description>

      <description>Anyone who has done electronics design knows the importance of bypass or decoupling capacitors, but mostly through received rules-of-thumb such as: “each IC should have a .1 &amp;#181;F capacitor,” “add one 1 &amp;#181;F for every eight ICs,” place decoupling capacitors “as close as possible,” and so on [1][2]. There’s very little in popular sources about experimentally measuring and verifying the effect of capacitor networks.</description>

      <title>The Dangerous Territory of Pre-GPT4</title>
      <link>https://liuliu.me/eyes/the-dangerous-territory-of-pre-gpt4/</link>
      <description>With broader access to Llama, Alpaca, ChatGLM, and Dolly available on ordinary consumer-level hardware, we have entered a new phase where every technology-literate person can access GPT-3 level perplexity language models, which also inherit all the shortcomings of GPT-3 level models. These models hallucinate a lot, lack the knowledge of their more parameter-heavy counterparts, and are not nearly as reliable. However, with the right prompt, they are just effective enough at generating marketing copies, manipulating societal opinions, and making convincing arguments on either side as we are prompting.</description>

      <title>What Power BI is still missing</title>
      <link>https://mutt0-ds.github.io/posts/2023/03/what-power-bi-is-missing/</link>
      <description>During these months, I had the chance to take a look at Power BI at the enterprise level, juggling advanced requests from hundreds of users and reports. I am impressed by all the features that the developers have rolled out recently, greatly improving both user and creator experiences. However, one should always maintain an impartial critical vision of the tools, no matter how useful they can be. For this reason, I decided to share my thoughts about some features that are currently lacking or require over-complicated solutions (often from third-party tools), in the hope that Microsoft will find them useful when working on Power BI’s development roadmap.</description>
