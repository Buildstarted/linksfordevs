      <title>Roundup herbicide ingredient connected to epidemic levels of chronic kidney disease</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2023-10-roundup-herbicide-ingredient-epidemic-chronic.html</link>
      <description>For the past couple of decades, tens of thousands of people living in rural Sri Lanka have been devastated by kidney failure due to unclear causes, also known as CKDu. Similar incidences of mysterious kidney diseases have emerged in tropical farming communities around the world.</description>

      <title>The Present Should Be Signed</title>
      <link>https://fabisevi.ch/2023/08/09/the-present-should-be-signed/</link>
      <description>When I wrote The Future Will Be Signed almost six years ago the latest in AI advancements was Google Duplex. If you&amp;#39;re like me and have never used Google Duplex, it&amp;#39;s a feature of Google Assistant that could make calls on behalf of a person and automatically perform a task, such as booking restaurant tables. While you may have never heard of Google Duplex there&amp;#39;s a good chance you&amp;#39;ve used a generative AI tool like ChatGPT, Midjourney, or GitHub Copilot. Authenticity We’re going to need a way to prove the authenticity of a piece of digital content, everywhere, in a simple manner. This is where public key cryptography comes in. Our current solutions are noble efforts, but remain too complex. It&amp;#39;s quite an understatement to say that AI has come a long way since 2018, and yet the blog post&amp;#39;s core thesis is even stronger today than when it was written. At the time I was concerned about a future where deepfakes, audio manipulation, and text generation spread across the internet. We&amp;#39;re now living in the beginning of that future, this is our present. It has never been faster or easier to generate inorganic content, the tools to do so are more usable and accessible than ever. AI already has us questioning what we see on the internet, and the problem isn&amp;#39;t going away. Fake news articles are being written by ChatGPT, fake books are being written with ChatGPT, and of course fake reviews made up by ChatGPT are being used to sell all of this.</description>

      <description>Much of the productivity and personal growth advice today encourages us to capture as much information as we can. But we don&amp;#39;t have the time nor the motivation to process all this information into knowledge. Instead we need to focus ourselves on what is important to capture.</description>

      <description>Gentle reader, permit me to try and convince you that data analysis is better
with logic programming. In this post I’ll analyse a staple dataset – the
ggplot2 diamond prices – using a symbolic approach which, I will
demonstrate, is able to establish a robust model, otherwise difficult to
recover.</description>

      <title>Why Is the Frontend Stack So Complicated?</title>
      <link>https://matt-rickard.com/why-is-the-frontend-stack-so-complicated</link>
      <description>The frontend ecosystem is notoriously confusing. At every layer, there seem to be incompatible, competing standards.

No universal import system. ESModules, CommonJS, Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD), and Universal Module Definition (UMD) are all different ways you can import or share your code. Bundlers try and solve some of this by supporting multiple methods. But

Layers of minification, uglification, and transpilation. Code undergoes multiple transformations before it’s ran. TypeScript g</description>

      <title>Use Endpoint Filters and Route Groups in Minimal APIs | BinaryIntellect Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://www.binaryintellect.net/articles/7efeaba7-8881-4f29-98d0-13e2ceb0cb9c.aspx</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs allow you to quickly create controller-less HTTP APIs with minimal dependencies. A minimal API typically has an endpoint URL and an endpoint handler. At times you want to intercept an endpoint handler so that you can add pre and post processing to the endpoint handler. That&amp;#39;s where Endpoint Filters come into picture. When there are too many endpoints, it makes sense to group them using a common URL prefix. This is taken care by Route Groups. In this article we will examine both with a few examples.</description>

      <link>https://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/keyboards-cloud-costs-static-analysis-and-philosophy/</link>
      <description>Michael Outlaw is a father, husband, and software developer based out of Atlanta, GA. A fan of gadgets and all things technology, when he isn’t found behind the clickety clack of his favorite mechanical keyboard he’s usually found riding a bicycle on his favorite road or trail systems. A father of two boys, Michael often spends his free time teaching his boys how to lose with dignity as they destroy him in game franchises like Overwatch, Halo, and Call of Duty. When not sharing his love of Git, C#, and unit testing, he can be found spending his “study time” studying the sounds of guitar and music theory.</description>
