In this blog entry, I&amp;#39;m going to go over what Apple announced, existing technologies, and the impact to end users. Moreover, I&amp;#39;m going to call out some of Apple&amp;#39;s questionable claims.</description>

      <description>Too often, a popular consumer app unexpectedly gets worse: Some combination of harder to use, missing
    features, and slower.  At a time in history where software is significantly eating the world, this is nonsensical. It’s also
    damaging to the lives of the people who depend on these products.</description>

open.  (That, at least, is what I take from the frequent shouts of &amp;quot;holy cow,
man, look at your browser!&amp;quot;)  Nonetheless, I have long thought that it would be
worth getting my total tab count down.  I have tabs open for a bunch of
reasons.</description>
