      <title>The Case for Design Engineers</title>
      <link>https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/the-case-for-design-engineers/</link>
      <description>If I had to put myself into one of the buckets that constitute job titles, “Design Engineer” might be closest to my own sense of self-identification. That or just plain old “Web Designer”—there’s just so many jobs when it comes to building software.</description>

      <title>Cargo Culting Software Engineering Practices</title>
      <link>https://isthisit.nz/posts/2022/cargo-culting-software-engineering-practices/</link>
      <description>Three months into my first Big Tech gig I was talking to a mentor about the overhead involved with the way the organisation worked. Meetings for standups, tech huddles, refinements, retros and product reviews; Processes such as limiting work in progress, desk checks, spikes, stories, and tasks. Coming from a startup we delivered high quality software without all of that labelled process. The mentor lent me his copy of Extreme Programming by Kent Beck, and that book gave me a framework to develop my own philosophy on software delivery and engineering practices.</description>

      <link>https://jason5lee.me/2022/06/05/understanding-kotlin-coroutine/</link>
      <description>Coroutine is a mechanism in Kotlin to simplify writing concurrent programs. But the concept of coroutine seems to be not very easy to understand. In this article, I will introduce my intuitive understanding of coroutines. This article won&amp;#39;t go into too much detail, focusing on providing a familiar metaphor for this seemingly unfamiliar concept.</description>

      <description>There are so many different ways to create a web application today, it&amp;#39;s staggering. In this post, we&amp;#39;ll try to make some semblance of order. We&amp;#39;ll go over the most popular technology choices in each layer of web application development, and see their pros and cons. That includes the client-side tech, the backend server, the ways to deploy to Azure, the CI/CD pipeline, the database, and the login mechanism.</description>

      <title>RFC 9113: HTTP/2</title>
      <link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html</link>
      <description>This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext
        Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP version 2 (HTTP/2). HTTP/2 enables a more
        efficient use of network resources and a
        reduced latency by introducing field compression and allowing multiple
        concurrent exchanges on the same connection. 
       This document obsoletes RFCs 7540 and 8740.</description>

      <link>https://jonpauluritis.com/articles/recentfinancialhistory/</link>
      <description>May 2022. For the last few weeks the stock market, bond market, VC markets, crypto-currencies, and anything else related to money has been taking an absolute nose dive. Tech stocks have in some cases lost upwards of 80% of their value. Inflation has been cranking at 7%-10% for the last year. </description>
