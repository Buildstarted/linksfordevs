      <description>5 years of weekly updates, wow. It&amp;#39;s not like anything of much significance has happened in that time, right?! I&amp;#39;ve done these videos every single week without fail, through high and lows and no matter where I was in the world. As I say early on, they&amp;#39;ve helped keep me</description>

      <title>Testing a compiler that can’t even print stuff out</title>
      <link>https://blog.danieljanus.pl/2021/09/25/testing-lithium/</link>
      <description>I’m enjoying a&amp;#160;week-long vacation. In addition to&amp;#160;other vacationy things (a&amp;#160;trip to&amp;#160;Prague, yay!), I&amp;#160;wanted to&amp;#160;do&amp;#160;some off-work programming Just For Fun™ and revisit one of my dormant pet projects, to&amp;#160;see if I&amp;#160;can make some progress.</description>

      <title>How Replication Works in MySQL</title>
      <link>https://siemens.blog/posts/how-replication-works-in-mysql/</link>
      <description>MySQL has a feature known as replication where data from one database server (referred to as the source or primary) is copied to other database servers (replicas). Conceptually, it’s pretty straight forward. All of your data mutations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, etc.) are done against the primary database. Those commands are then copied and applied to the replicas.</description>

      <description>I don’t know about you, but nothing gets me going in the morning quite like a
