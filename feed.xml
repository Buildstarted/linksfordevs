      <description>Cyclomatic complexity is one of those terms that makes you think you missed something when you were learning programming. However, the concept is a really simple one.

      <description>A while ago, I decided to add PowerShell to my automation toolbox. Since I believe the best way to learn a new language is to do test-driven development and PowerShell has a fantastic module for this, called Pester. The framework is super intuitive, easy to do mocking in, and allows you develop your code design from tests.</description>

      <title>The deep learning obesity crisis</title>
      <link>https://vl8r.eu/posts/2022/07/03/the-deep-learning-obesity-crisis/</link>
      <description>Deep learning have made dramatic improvements over the last decades. Part of
this is attributed to improved methods that allowed training wider and deeper neural
networks. This can also be attributed to better hardware, as well as the
development of techniques to use this hardware efficiently. All of this leads to
neural networks that grow exponentially in size. But is continuing down this path
the best avenue for success?</description>

      <title>Hashed and Hierarchical Timing Wheels</title>
      <link>https://paulcavallaro.com/blog/hashed-and-hierarchical-timing-wheels/</link>
      <description>Today’s paper was written in 1987 by George Varghese and Tony Lauck from Digital Equipment Corporation (!), and has withstood the test of time. It’s about how to efficiently implement a timer facility that allows you to start a fixed length timer and perform some action once it has expired. The ability to set timeouts on requests or operations is almost a given, so being able to handle these timers efficiently is quite important.</description>
