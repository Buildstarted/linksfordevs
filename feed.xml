      <title>Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster</title>
      <link>https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html</link>
      <description>Introduction As I was browsing the web and catching up on some sites I visit periodically, I found a cool article from Tom Hayden about using Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) and mrjob in order to compute some statistics on win/loss ratios for chess games he downloaded from the millionbase archive, and generally have fun with EMR. Since the data volume was only about 1.75GB containing around 2 million chess games, I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR.</description>

      <title>Working with Feature Flags in ASP.NET Core MVC application</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/adding-feature-flags-to-an-asp-net-core-app-part2/</link>
      <description>This post is about Adding feature flags to an ASP.NET Core app. In this blog post we will discuss about various extension points of Feature Management package. In the last post we implemented the feature management in controller code. But that might not be the scenario always - we might like to control the feature visibility in views or in middleware. We will be able to use IFeatureManager instance, but FeatureManagement package offers more extension points like Views, Filters and Middleware out of the box.</description>

      <description>As a Director of Engineering, I have monthly 1:1s with all of my direct reports. A 1:1 (one-on-one) is a recurring meeting with no set agenda between a manager and one of their reports. The internet is full of valuable insight into how to run them from my perspective, (ex. The Update, The Vent, and The Disaster) but somewhat more limited in advice on how to make the most of them if you’re on the other side of the table.</description>
