      <title>Quest for my perfect watch.</title>
      <link>https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/watch.html</link>
      <description>I love my Casio Protrek watch, I won’t leave the house without it. I’ve owned it for years, as well as some earlier Protrek models. Those earlier models didn’t break — these watches are basically indestructible — I just liked them so much I went and bought the new revisions!</description>

      <title>Why my video calls sucked (and how I fixed it)</title>
      <link>https://www.snoyman.com/blog/why-my-video-calls-sucked/</link>
      <description>A few years ago, I wrote a blog post about how I set up the networking in our house following some major construction. I was really excited about how much better the internet would be. No more WiFi dead zones, and a wired connection to my computer to provide extra speed and stability to my office. Overall, the results were great. Speed test anywhere in my house showed I was getting the full 500mbps promised by my cable company. However, not everything was working as expected:</description>

      <title>How to get allocations in .NET? And how big is an empty array?</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/db43d6f4-4b93-415f-be03-600ee358cdfd</link>
      <description>Often times we hear about allocations on the heap. How can we easily measure this? This article will show you a very easy way of doing so.
