      <title>Doing My Day Job on Chimera Linux</title>

  What Is Chimera Linux?

  Chimera Linux is a unique from-scratch
Linux distribution created in 2021 by q66 that
combines the Linux kernel, musl libc, FreeBSD userland, apk package
manager, and dinit binary init
system. The whole system is built with the LLVM toolchain.


Since I started running the first alpha release of Chimera Linux in
2023, my goal has been to eventually migrate to Chimera as my primary operating
system. This includes personal tinkering as well as for my job as a programmer.
A recent trip to Central Queensland afforded an opportunity to test the waters
of daily driving Chimera Linux for work. The trip spanned two weeks and involved
working remotely (as usual) during the week, and sightseeing on the weekends.
This post details some of the barriers that I encountered and how I worked
around them. While the post is focussed on Chimera Linux, the details probably
apply to most distributions using musl libc.</description>

      <title>Riff: LLMs are Software Diamonds</title>
      <link>https://www.evalapply.org/posts/llms-are-diamonds/index.html</link>
      <description>The making of a diamond is a repeatable, but naturally non-reproducible process. The exact same input of carbon subject to the exact same configuration of pressure, temperature, forge, time, process control will never produce the exact same diamond twice. Once made, a diamond is unique. And once made, a diamond is forever.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Linux Netkit interfaces — with a grain of eBPF</title>
      <link>https://blog.yadutaf.fr/2025/07/01/introduction-to-linux-netkit-interfaces-with-a-grain-of-ebpf/</link>
      <description>If you are reading this, chances are you are already familiar with Linux’s veth
interfaces. If not, you can think of it as a virtual Ethernet cable for Linux
which is capable of crossing a network namespace (netns) boundary. In other
words, it is one of the fundamental building blocks of containers like Docker,
Podman and many others.</description>

      <title>Cost of learning | Matej Jelluš</title>
      <link>https://juffalow.com/blog/other/cost-of-learning</link>
      <description>One of the best ways to learn something new is to actually try it. I wanted to learn how to use AWS and some of its services, so I moved my projects to AWS. This was just a very basic setup (EC2, S3, CloudFront). Later I wanted to use additional services like Cognito, RDS, MediaConvert, Simple Queue Service, Simple Email Service, etc. So I started building a new project where I was able to use those. It started "slowly" with costs like $20 per month, grew with database to $100 per month and later to almost $300 per month with Kubernetes and other services. And now I am back to $20 per month.</description>

      <title>Context Engineering Realized: Context Window Architecture</title>
      <link>https://mrhillsman.com/posts/context-engineering-realized-context-window-architecture/</link>
      <description>After working on this for some months now I would like to put it out there based on the considerable attention being put towards “context engineering”. I am proposing the Context Window Architecture (CWA) – a conceptual reference architecture to bring engineering discipline to LLM prompt construction. Would love for others to participate and provide feedback. A reference implementation where CWA is used in a real-world/pragmatic scenario could be great to tease out more regarding context engineering and if CWA is useful. Additionally I am no expert by far so feedback and collaboration would be awesome.</description>
