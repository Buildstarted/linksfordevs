      <title>Why Is the Frontend Stack So Complicated?</title>
      <link>https://matt-rickard.com/why-is-the-frontend-stack-so-complicated</link>
      <description>The frontend ecosystem is notoriously confusing. At every layer, there seem to be incompatible, competing standards.

No universal import system. ESModules, CommonJS, Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD), and Universal Module Definition (UMD) are all different ways you can import or share your code. Bundlers try and solve some of this by supporting multiple methods. But

Layers of minification, uglification, and transpilation. Code undergoes multiple transformations before it’s ran. TypeScript g</description>

      <title>Use Endpoint Filters and Route Groups in Minimal APIs | BinaryIntellect Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://www.binaryintellect.net/articles/7efeaba7-8881-4f29-98d0-13e2ceb0cb9c.aspx</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs allow you to quickly create controller-less HTTP APIs with minimal dependencies. A minimal API typically has an endpoint URL and an endpoint handler. At times you want to intercept an endpoint handler so that you can add pre and post processing to the endpoint handler. That&amp;#39;s where Endpoint Filters come into picture. When there are too many endpoints, it makes sense to group them using a common URL prefix. This is taken care by Route Groups. In this article we will examine both with a few examples.</description>

      <description>Michael Outlaw is a father, husband, and software developer based out of Atlanta, GA. A fan of gadgets and all things technology, when he isn’t found behind the clickety clack of his favorite mechanical keyboard he’s usually found riding a bicycle on his favorite road or trail systems. A father of two boys, Michael often spends his free time teaching his boys how to lose with dignity as they destroy him in game franchises like Overwatch, Halo, and Call of Duty. When not sharing his love of Git, C#, and unit testing, he can be found spending his “study time” studying the sounds of guitar and music theory.</description>
