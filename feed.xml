      <title>Alexandre N&amp;#233;d&amp;#233;lec - Week 20, 2022 - Tips I learned this week</title>
      <link>https://www.techwatching.dev/posts/w20-2022-tips-learned-this-week</link>
      <description>Once again, I found myself forgetting that this can lose context in JavaScript/TypeScript which results in exceptions because this  is undefined. This is probably obvious for most developers but this is not a case I come across often so it&amp;#39;s better to write it down so that I have something to refer to next time.</description>

      <title>Coding As Creative Expression</title>
      <link>https://fabisevi.ch/2022/05/21/coding-as-creative-expression/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve seen many versions of this question posed over the years, and to Matthew&amp;#39;s credit it&amp;#39;s a very good question. As you can see in the replies people translate their lived experience writing code and answer art or science based on however they conceptualize and practice programming. A few years ago MIT conducted a study that concluded &amp;quot;reading computer code is not the same as reading language&amp;quot;, answering the question of whether coding is art or science with a rigorously documented &amp;quot;both&amp;quot;. While I&amp;#39;m hard-pressed to argue with science, I&amp;#39;d like to provide a different answer, one that&amp;#39;s a little more conceptual.</description>

      <title>The /bin/true Command and Copyright</title>
      <link>http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/humor/ATT_Copyright_true.html</link>
      <description>One of the fun examples among all the copyright fuss is the  extreme  example
of  copyright claims made by AT&amp;amp;T some time in the 1980s.  It&amp;#39;s the /bin/true
program.  This is a &amp;quot;dummy&amp;quot; library program whose main function is to make it
easy  to  write  infinite  loops  (while true do ...) in shells scripts.  The
&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; program does nothing; it merely exits with a zero exit  status.   This
can  be  done with an empty file that&amp;#39;s marked executable, and that&amp;#39;s what it
was in the earliest unix system  libraries.   Such  an  empty  file  will  be
interpreted  as  a  shell  script  that  does nothing, and since it does this
successfully, the shell exits with a zero exit status.   But  AT&amp;amp;T&amp;#39;s  lawyers
decided that this was worthy of copyright protection.</description>
