      <description>It‚Äôs been nearly two years since I moved from being an Individual Contributor (IC) to a Tech Lead Manager (TLM) - a hybrid role that combines the responsibilities of a manager with those of a senior engineer.

But also - of course it‚Äôs a trap.</description>

      <description>In this post, we show how an attacker can exploit Supabase‚Äôs MCP integration to leak a developer‚Äôs private SQL tables. Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard way for LLMs to interact with external tools. While this unlocks new capabilities, it also introduces new risk surfaces.</description>
