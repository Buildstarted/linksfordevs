      <title>How I Hacked Google App Engine: Anatomy of a Java Bytecode Exploit</title>
      <link>https://blog.polybdenum.com/2021/05/05/how-i-hacked-google-app-engine-anatomy-of-a-java-bytecode-exploit.html</link>
      <description>Back in college, I was very interested in Java bytecode. When I got an internship at Google in 2013, I was skeptical of the security of the Java version of Google App Engine and got permission to spend the last week of my internship doing a mini red team exercise, trying to break into App Engine. This is the story of how I found a vulnerability and developed an exploit to break out of the App Engine sandbox and get arbitrary code execution on a Google server.</description>

      <link>https://jake.nyc/words/preserving-the-web/</link>
      <description>As Sarah and I were in the middle of moving, packing our lives into cardboard boxes, we unearthed a bunch of old laptops. Before donating them, I cracked them open to back everything up — and found a ton of old websites I’d worked on over the years. Rather than just shuffle the files endlessly between hard drives, I resolved to get them all online.
Enter jake.museum: an online collection of my web design and development work, from 2007 to the present day.</description>
