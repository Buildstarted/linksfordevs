      <title>An unwanted update to your Google Account</title>
      <link>https://roboleary.net/2021/05/01/unwated-change-to-your-google-account.html</link>
      <description>Google sent me an email informing me that they will change the country associated with my account in 30 days. What I find curious is that it says the services are essentially the same between different countries. So, there is no advantage to me as a consumer for anything to change, the only difference will be in how my data is processed. Privacy alert! I found how to make a Country Association Inquiry to dispute this.</description>
