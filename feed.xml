      <title>Building ASP.NET Core Minimal API in VB.NET</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/building-aspnetcore-minimal-api-in-vbnet/</link>
      <description>This post is about how to build ASP.NET Core Minimal API in VB.NET. Long back I wrote a blog post about Building ASP.NET Core web apps with VB.NET. Today Maurice asked whether we can build ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs in VB.NET. So I thought I will wrote a blog post about it.</description>

      <title>ImperialViolet - Passkeys</title>
      <link>https://www.imperialviolet.org/2022/09/22/passkeys.html</link>
      <description>This is an opinionated, “quick-start” guide to using passkeys as a
web developer. It’s hopefully broadly applicable, but one size will
never fit all authentication needs and this guide ignores everything
that’s optional. So take it as a worked example, but not as gospel.</description>

      <description>We are excited to share some progress we’ve made on Chainguard Enforce, the first comprehensive software supply chain risk management platform. Starting today, Chainguard Enforce is generally available, and we are expanding our early access program to make it easier for organizations to try it out. We’re also announcing some new features including: &amp;quot;agentless&amp;quot; mode, SOC2 Type 1 certification, a catalog of predefined security policies with alerting, custom integrations, and more! With Chainguard Enforce, organizations can focus on delivering software efficiently throughout every step of the software development lifecycle, while securing their environments with real-time policy decisions, and access to critical security metadata for incident management.</description>

      <description>In recent versions of Edge (and Chromium browsers in general) it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder to run development Web sites on localhost, unless you run in https. Certificate setup continues to be a pain in the ass, and it doesn&amp;#39;t help that Edge recently decided to no longer allow bypassing of certificate errors. In this post I describe some of the localhost issues and how you can still bypass certificate validation on localhost or go the legit route and install a certificate.</description>

      <title>Hacking anything with GNU Guix</title>
      <link>https://gexp.no/blog/hacking-anything-with-gnu-guix.html</link>
      <description>Perhaps my favourite feature of Guix is guix shell.  It is one of those
tools that I don&amp;#39;t know how to do without.  Even if you are not ready to
use Guix as a package manager (or distro), guix shell alone might be a
reason to have Guix installed.</description>

      <title>Press release: Use of Google Analytics for web analytics</title>
      <link>https://www.datatilsynet.dk/english/google-analytics/use-of-google-analytics-for-web-analytics</link>
      <description>The Danish Data Protection Agency has looked into the tool Google Analytics, its settings, and the terms under which the tool is provided. On the basis of this review, the Danish Data Protection Agency concludes that the tool cannot, without more, be used lawfully. Lawful use requires the implementation of supplementary measures in addition to the settings provided by Google.</description>

      <title>AWS vs GCP reliability is wildly different</title>
      <link>https://freeman.vc/notes/aws-vs-gcp-reliability-is-wildly-different</link>
      <description>Cloud compute is usually seen as an ethereal resource. You launch VMs and spin them down, billed to the second. The billing and the mental model make it seem like these resources are limitless. That&amp;#39;s typically one of the selling points versus on-prem compute. They can scale responsively to your load so you&amp;#39;re not paying for excess compute that you don&amp;#39;t need but it&amp;#39;s there when you want it.</description>

      <description>There have been discussions in the aftermath of the log4j vulnerability about whether or not open source is broken or sustainable, what we can do to improve the sustainability of the open source ecosystem moving forwards, and the entitlement of users and companies in expecting maintainers to fix their problems.</description>

      <title>Spellcheckers exfiltrating PII… not so fast  ::  Aaron Gustafson</title>
      <link>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/spellcheckers-exfiltrating-pii_-not-so-fast/</link>
      <description>A recent post from the Otto JS research team highlighted how spellcheck services can inadvertently exfiltrate sensitive user data, including passwords, from your site. To be honest, I found the post a tad alarmist and lacking when it came to recommending solid protections. Consider this your no-nonsense guide to protecting your users’ sensitive information.</description>

      <title>Alfred, or &amp;quot;How to super-charge your Mac and automate routine tasks&amp;quot;</title>
      <link>https://blev.dev/articles/alfred/</link>
      <description>I’ve been reading The Productive Programmer for a book club and it’s put me on a productivity binge. It’s an older book and many of its recommendations no longer apply, so I got excited when, while researching modern alternatives for some of the tools the author recommends, I happened to stumble on Alfred. Alfred is a replacement for the Mac spotlight that has already changed how I work. In fact, I was so excited by Alfred that within ten minutes of downloading, I immediately bought a “mega-supporter” license!</description>

      <title>Branchable MySQL: Managing multiple dev environments</title>
      <link>https://mliezun.github.io/2022/09/20/branchable-mysql.html</link>
      <description>When teams start to grow, having a single dev environment becomes an issue. People start stepping on each others toes.
A common problem is that two people want to apply incompatible migrations on the database. That problem is impossible 
to fix if folks are working on parallel branches.
If we can have a database for each branch of a project, that will remove much of the pain of having multiple devs applying
changes to the db.</description>

      <title>Renaming Our Company Revealed a Critical Bug</title>
      <link>https://alic.dev/blog/renaming.html</link>
      <description>TL;DR: Our game had a bug that would erase all save files, 
					whenever the file path of the local storage directory contained the character &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;.
					If your Windows username contained an &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;, your data would be gone. Luckily
					renaming our company to one containing an &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; revealed my mistake
