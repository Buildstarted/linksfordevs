      <title>How To Setup Redis With Dependency Injection in C# in 10 Minutes!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=2fe49mg1RnQ</link>
      <description>A viewer requested a tutorial on using Redis with dependency injection without all of the ASP NET Core caching layers. They just wanted to work with it directly.

In this video tutorial, I'll show you how you can easily get setup to use Redis in your C# applications!

      <title>Building Multi-Tenant APIs Using EF Core and Row-Level Security</title>

Think your authorization checks are secure? Think again.

In this video, I show how one missing filter in your API can leak sensitive user data ‚Äî and how to prevent that with PostgreSQL's built-in Row-Level Security (RLS).

‚úÖ We‚Äôll build a real .NET Core API using EF Core and Postgres  
‚úÖ Show how to extract user IDs from JWT tokens  
‚úÖ Use an EF Core interceptor to safely set session variables  
‚úÖ Enable and configure RLS in Postgres for bulletproof data isolation

Protect your multi-tenant systems. Stop depending on app-layer filters alone.

üí° Perfect for .NET devs building secure, multi-tenant apps.

      <title>Document Search in .NET with Kernel Memory</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=h8bKn1nzjrQ</link>
      <description>Ever wanted to search or perform question answering on documents, PDFs, or web pages but weren't sure about costs or security? Kernel Memory is a .NET library that allows you to use whatever embedding and text models you'd like (including Ollama and OpenAI models) and whatever vector store you'd like to index and search documents in a flexible way using a minimal amount of C# code.</description>

      <title>That fractal that's been up on my wall for 12 years</title>
      <link>https://chriskw.xyz/2025/05/21/Fractal/</link>
      <description>Warning: Math, Handwaving

I spent a lot of time doodling in middle school in lieu of whatever it is middle schoolers are
supposed to be doing. Somewhere between the Cool S‚Äôs
and Penrose triangles I stumbled upon a neat
way to fill up graph paper by repeatedly combining and copying squares. I suspected there was
more to the doodle but wasn‚Äôt quite sure how to analyze it. Deciding to delegate to a future version of me that
knows more math, I put it up on the wall behind my desk where it has followed me from high
school to college to the present day.
