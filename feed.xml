      <title>Streamlining your Debugging process with Breakpoint Groups - Visual Studio Blog</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/streamlining-your-debugging-process-with-breakpoint-groups/</link>
      <description>Have you ever had a situation when you are debugging a complex scenario with a huge list of breakpoints, and you find yourself scrolling and tapping in the breakpoints windows to disable/enable them individually and repetitively?

      <link>https://www.bitestring.com/posts/2023-03-19-web-fingerprinting-is-worse-than-I-thought.html</link>
      <description>If you are reading this article, you are most likely using a web browser, and you have some expectations or beliefs about online privacy and security. For example, I do not know what you are reading on other tabs on your web browser, and you would like to keep it that way. But the websites themselves know that you are reading a particular page on their website. They most likely know your IP address and if you are signed in to their website, they also know your identity. This is not unreasonable because you chose to identify yourself in exchange for certain services. That’s how web works.</description>

      <description>.NET developers rely on .NET’s automatic memory allocation and garbage collection (GC) mechanisms to handle the memory needs of their applications. For most use cases GC isn’t something developers need to worry about. However, in modern architectures where .NET applications are running in memory constrained environments, like containers and AWS Lambda functions, the GC might […]</description>

      <link>https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-end-of-frontend-development/</link>
      <description>Large language models like GPT-4 are becoming increasingly capable, at an alarming rate. Within a couple of years, we won&amp;#39;t need developers any more! …Or at least, that&amp;#39;s the narrative going viral on Twitter. I&amp;#39;m much more optimistic about what these AI advancements mean for the future of software development.</description>

      <title>sqlelf and 20 years of Nix</title>

      <description>If you want to skip ahead, please checkout the sqlelf repository and give me your feedback. &amp;#127881; We are celebrating 20 years of Nix &amp;#127881; Within that 20 years Nix has ushered in a new paradigm of how to build software reliably that is becoming more ubiquitous in the software industry. It has inspired imitators such as Spack &amp;amp; Guix. Given the concepts introduced by Nix and it’s willingnes to eschew some fundamental Linux concepts such as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. I can’t help but think has Nix gone far enough within the 20 years?</description>

      <title>Why venture capital should be consensus-averse - Credistick</title>
      <link>https://credistick.com/why-venture-capital-should-be-consensus-averse/</link>
      <description>In The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Keynes wrote about investment through the metaphor of a newspaper contest to select the six best looking people from a group of photos, with the prize being awarded to the contestant whose choice most closely corresponded to the average of all contestants. Keynes’ point was that,… Continue reading Why venture capital should be consensus-averse</description>

      <title>Exploring Lichess data on improvement using e4 vs d4 and blitz vs rapid</title>
      <link>https://svilentodorov.xyz/blog/chess-e4-vs-d4/</link>
      <description>A common question in the chess community is whether to play e4 or d4 as a beginner. Opinions are generally split between e4 being better for learning, no difference, and rarely that d4 is better. Typical reasoning being that e4 leads to sharper games and gives you more opportunities to learn. The other starting moves as white are rarely recommended for beginners altogether and rarely played at all levels. Another common question is whether playing shorter or longer games helps you improve faster, with the orthodoxy being that longer games help you learn more overall. The standard argument I’ve seen is that you have more time to analyze things in longer games which helps in all modes while the skills you improve in quicker games are less applicable in the longer time controls. I’ve downloaded games from Lichess’ database to explore those questions.</description>
