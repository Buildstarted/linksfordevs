      <title>I Don’t Know How To Count That Low - LessWrong</title>
      <link>https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/koGbEwgbfst2wCbzG/i-don-t-know-how-to-count-that-low</link>
      <description>Edit: greetings Hacker News. This is a cross-post from my own blog, 
AcesoUnderGlass.com. If you enjoy this post, consider checking that out as well.

Back when I was at Google we had a phrase, “I don’t know how to count that low”.
It was used to dismiss normal-company-sized problems as beneath our dignity to
engage with: if you didn’t need 100 database shards scattered around the globe,
were you even doing real work?

It was used as a sign of superiority within Google, but it also pointed at a
real problem: I once failed a job interview at a start-up when I wondered out
loud if the DB was small enough to be held in memory, when it was several orders
of magnitude lower than when I should even have begun worrying about that. I
didn’t know the limit because it had been many years since I’d had a problem
that could be solved with a DB small enough to be held in its entirety in
memory. And they were right to fail me for that: the fact that I was good at
solving strictly more difficult problems didn’t matter because I didn’t know how
to solve the easier ones they actually had. I could run but not walk, and some
problems require walking.

It’s a problem, but it can be a pleasant kind of problem to have, compared to
others. Another example: my dad is a Ph.D. statistician who spent most of his
life working in SAS, a powerful statistical programming language, and using
“spreadsheet statistics” as a slur. When I asked permission to share this
anecdote he sent me a list of ways Excel was terrible.



Then he started consulting for me, who was cruelly unwilling to pay the $9000
license fee for SAS when Google Sheets was totally adequate for the problem (WHO
HAS FOOD AT HOME NOW DAD?!?).*

My dad had to go through a horrible phase of being bad at the worse tool, and
found a lot of encouragement when I reframed “I could have done this with one
line in SAS and am instead losing to this error-riddled child’s toy” to “I
didn’t know how to count that low, but now that it matters I am</description>

      <title>Node-RED</title>
      <link>https://nodered.org/</link>
      <description>The light-weight runtime is built on Node.js, taking full advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model. This makes it ideal to run at the edge of the network on low-cost hardware such as the Raspberry Pi as well as in the cloud.</description>

      <title>Choosing a cache</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/choose-cache/1/</link>
      <description>Today, I’d like to provide some help on how to choose a cache solution. I will organize it into two parts: In this post, we will list what features a cache must have and which ones it can optionally provide. Most criteria are general and can be used regardless of the tech stack, while a couple is specific to the JVM.In the second part, I’ll list providers and verify their respective capabilities Why cache? First, let’s bust a common myth. Using a cache is not the sign of a b</description>

      <title>Making a Game in Janet, Part 2: Judging Janet</title>
      <link>https://ianthehenry.com/posts/janet-game/judging-janet/</link>
      <description>In order to continue making progress with my little Janet game, I had to write some tests. Because even though I’d only just started, I already had a bug.









(There is a piece missing from the bottom of this rectangle. There should not be a piece missing from the bottom of this rectangle.)
Now, I’m sure that I wrote plenty of bugs over the course of writing my raycaster, and I didn’t bother writing tests for any them – I just fixed them, re-ran the code, and manually verified that the bug had disappeared.
But this bug was a very shy bug. It was hard to manually reproduce it; it was hard to trigger the exact conditions that caused it. So it would have been really annoying to fix it using my usual guess-and-check approach – it’d be much easier to trigger the conditions once, print out the state, put that into a test, and then re-run the test until I had a fix.
But, sadly, things are not so simple.
Because I cannot actually write tests.
I can only write self-modifying tests.
It’s an unfortunate, incurable condition. Now that I am used to writing self-modifying tests, I can’t go back to writing tests strewn with boolean assertions. I have tasted of ambrosia, and cannot now return to wine.</description>

      <description>Tl;dr: If you’re running apt-get in a script and need to wait for other apt-get process to finish (i.e. you’re running into DPkg lock errors), set the DPkg::Lock::Timeout option (e.g. apt-get -o DPkg::Lock::Timeout=3 dist-upgrade).</description>

      <title>A very brief introduction to patterns for implementing a COM object that hands out references to itself</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20211025-00/?p=105828</link>
      <description>A common scenario for a COM object is that it needs to register itself as a callback or otherwise hand out references to itself. There are a few patterns for this. One of the first things you have to decide is whether the reference to the main object should be strong (keep the main object alive) or weak (not be considered for deciding whether the main object should be kept alive).</description>
