      <title>Max Hodak - What is relativity, anyway?</title>
      <link>https://maxhodak.com/nonfiction/2020/09/18/relativity.html</link>
      <description>Relativity is one of my favorite topics in physics. Its origins were almost pure logic puzzle science, which in my opinion is one of the most fun and satisfying types of science. Most people have a vague sense of what relativity is ‚Äì the speed of light is finite, and something about time travel? ‚Äì but they don‚Äôt really know what it is, which is too bad because the principles are very simple, and the results are pretty awesome.</description>

      <title>Brittney Braxton - Journaling as a Dev [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzrEDnIye14</link>
      <description>Note: There are initial captions directly in the video until the interpreter begins.

Are you working with impact and purpose? Are you solidly attuned on what you're doing month-to-month with your role? How difficult is it for you to track your accomplishments at work? If any of these questions lead to uncertain answers, then you should learn what it means to journal professionally as a dev. This talk will cover my exploration into journaling and its application to tracking my goals and progress as a software engineer. I will discuss how to set up your journal for any goals and how to score on your performance review!

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates associated with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels</title>
      <link>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0239252</link>
      <description>Until treatment and vaccine for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) becomes widely available, other methods of reducing infection rates should be explored. This study used a retrospective, observational analysis of deidentified tests performed at a national clinical laboratory to determine if circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity rates. Over 190,000 patients from all 50 states with SARS-CoV-2 results performed mid-March through mid-June, 2020 and matching 25(OH)D results from the preceding 12 months were included. Residential zip code data was required to match with US Census data and perform analyses of race/ethnicity proportions and latitude. A total of 191,779 patients were included (median age, 54 years [interquartile range 40.4‚Äì64.7]; 68% female. The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 9.3% (95% C.I. 9.2‚Äì9.5%) and the mean seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D was 31.7 (SD 11.7). The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was higher in the 39,190 patients with ‚Äúdeficient‚Äù 25(OH)D values (&lt;20 ng/mL) (12.5%, 95% C.I. 12.2‚Äì12.8%) than in the 27,870 patients with ‚Äúadequate‚Äù values (30‚Äì34 ng/mL) (8.1%, 95% C.I. 7.8‚Äì8.4%) and the 12,321 patients with values ‚â•55 ng/mL (5.9%, 95% C.I. 5.5‚Äì6.4%). The association between 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity was best fitted by the weighted second-order polynomial regression, which indicated strong correlation in the total population (R2 = 0.96) and in analyses stratified by all studied demographic factors. The association between lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates and higher circulating 25(OH)D levels remained significant in a multivariable logistic model adjusting for all included demographic factors (adjusted odds ratio 0.984 per ng/mL increment, 95% C.I. 0.983‚Äì0.986; p&lt;0.001). SARS-CoV-2 positivity is strongly and inversely associated with circulating 25(OH)D levels, a relationship that persists across latitudes, races/ethnicities, both sexes, and age ranges. Our findings provide impetus to explore the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.</description>

      <title>What Does Culturally Responsive Teaching Mean in an Online Environment? [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9__M7a8wHM</link>
      <description>Culturally responsive teaching (CRT) is an instructional approach that seeks to ensure academic success while developing students' sense of culture and social-political awareness. CRT allows students to see themselves in the curriculum and assignments provided by the teacher. In the online and traditional classroom, CRT provides opportunities for students to learn how to value their culture. During this time in America, it is especially important for students to have opportunities to express themselves while using online technology.

      <title>The forecasting fallacy ‚Äî Alex Murrell</title>
      <link>https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-forecasting-fallacy</link>
      <description>Marketers are prone to a prediction. You‚Äôll find them in the annual tirade of trend decks. In the PowerPoint projections of self-proclaimed prophets. In the feeds of forecasters and futurists. To understand the extent of our forecasting fascination, I analysed the websites of three management consul</description>

      <title>Stop just using ‚ÄúFrontend‚Äù or ‚ÄúBackend‚Äù to describe the Engineering you like</title>
      <link>https://www.michellelim.org/writing/stop-using-frontend-backend/</link>
      <description>Why the ‚Äúfrontend‚Äù vs ‚Äúbackend‚Äù engineering axis doesn't map well to engineers‚Äô psychology. And how using just one division can lead to job mismatches, turnover, and even push some new grad engineers into product management.</description>

      <title>Ayodele Odubela - Combatting Bias in ML [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4PYKab0jIE</link>
      <description>In this talk I cover how to see the bias in your data and machine learning models. By giving examples from recent research on biased facial recognition systems as well as cutting edge explainability algorithms, attendees can expect clarification on what bias means in machine learning.

      <title>Anthony Seure / Don't hate the book because you don't use it</title>
      <link>https://aseure.fr/articles/2020-09-18-dont-hate-the-book-because-you-dont-use-it/</link>
      <description>In a few months, I&amp;rsquo;ll celebrate my fifth year as a professional - understand paid - software engineer. I find this role to be a right balance of technical skills, human relationships and it fulfils my curiosity. As time goes by, I&amp;rsquo;m also starting to be disappointed by some of its negative aspects. While it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent me from sleeping, I think an effort could be made to challenge some lousy and short-sighted comments we see daily on social platforms.</description>

      <title>Facebook Connect: John Carmack Unscripted Live [Archive]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXmY26pOE-Y</link>
      <description>We restreamed a direct feed of the Facebook Connect presentation offered by John Carmack at 5:30PM PT on Sept. 16, 2020. 

Don't forget to read our full review of the Oculus Quest 2 right here: https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-2-review/

00:00:00 John Carmack starts talking
00:03:03 ‚ÄúGlobal lockdown and pandemic..."
00:04:35 ‚ÄúFrankly I‚Äôm kind of embarrassed by our social story here‚Ä¶‚Äù
00:05:12 ‚ÄúLocation-based VR has probably taken a terminal hit‚Ä¶‚Äù
00:06:00  "People are ok with making a sweaty mess in their own personal  headset..‚Äù
00:12:07 ‚ÄúReality...just seamlessly flows into the simulation...‚Äù
00:14:06 ‚ÄúQuest 2 is better, faster, cheaper, and we‚Äôre making a ton more of them..."
00:14:54 ‚Äú"Resolution is 3664x1920...‚Äù
00:16:33 ‚ÄúYou could start doing some real work with it..."
00:18:34 ‚ÄúBest display that we‚Äôve ever had..."
00:31:29 ‚ÄúStill haven‚Äôt announced a full wireless connection system for Link...we should have some kind of an Air Link‚Äù
00:32:47 Qualcomm XR2
00:59:12 ‚ÄúWhatever the next headset is we‚Äôve got to get higher resolution on the tracking cameras.‚Äù
01:00:45 ‚ÄúWe did look at this for the latter days of Gear VR, doing this kind of two part plug-in instead of drop-in, and there may still be some useful things to go there.‚Äù
01:00:59 ‚ÄúThere are still some things for which Go is the best headset‚Äù
01:02:04 ‚ÄúPutting on the headset should be as seamless as answering a phone call‚Ä¶‚Äù
1:02:31 ‚ÄúHaving things converged now on our VR platforms is an enormous relief..."
1:03:12 ‚ÄúThis low-powered gaming focused device which wasn‚Äôt really what anybody was aiming for at the beginning‚Ä¶‚Äù
1:05:17 ‚ÄúGetting the more inexpensive systems out on VR is critical..."
1:08:47 ‚ÄúMaybe you have a controller-free SKU where the controllers are more expensive but they never lose tracking‚Ä¶‚Äù
1:12:06 ‚ÄúIt is all about the headset learning to understand the world around it‚Ä¶‚Äù
1:18:41 ‚ÄúOur push to be a general purpose computing system‚Ä¶‚Äù
1:19:40 ‚ÄúWe need more Android applications‚Ä¶‚Äù
1:21:40 ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm about done here‚Ä¶"
