In this video, we tackle a common but tricky interview question: Level Order Traversal in Binary Trees. Many CS graduates struggle with this fundamental concept, but today, we&amp;#39;re breaking it down step by step!

Problem Breakdown:
- Given a binary tree, print each level on a separate line
- Maintain the correct order of nodes from left to right
- Output should display the hierarchy clearly

      <title>Transactional Savepoints in EF Core: Rollback Just What You Need! - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/transactional-savepoints-in-ef-core-rollback-just-what-you-need/</link>
      <description>We’ve all been there—you’re halfway through a multi-step transaction, and boom! &amp;#128165; Something fails. You don’t want to roll back everything, just the part that went wrong. That’s where Transactional Savepoints come in! Savepoints let you partially roll back transactions, keeping the good stuff while undoing just the problematic parts. If you&amp;#39;ve ever wished for a &amp;quot;Ctrl + Z&amp;quot; in database operations, this is it.</description>

      <title>The Art of Managing Skunks</title>
      <link>https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/blog/2025/02/09/2025-skunks.html</link>
      <description>Since moving from academic research to industry in 2017, I’ve worked on two software projects. Each one started as a small, clean-slate1 skunkworks effort involving 2-3 people and gradually expanded to a large, conventional software engineering effort with dozens of engineers. The first of these (from 2017 to 2021) was Delos at Meta, a Chubby/ZooKeeper/etcd-like control plane storage system. The second was a new Kafka engine (from 2022 to 2024) that can run on any disaggregated storage layer (and powers the Confluent Freight product, where S3 is used as that storage layer). Nearly every system at Meta depends in some way on Delos as of 2025 (e.g., this article describes an example dependency chain); Confluent Freight just became generally available and time will tell if it succeeds commercially, though early results are promising. this prior post might explain why I think clean-slate innovation is critical in systems.&amp;#160;↩</description>

      <title>My time machine runs on technical writing</title>
      <link>https://passo.uno/retrocomputing-tech-writing-lab/</link>
      <description>This past weekend I’ve been experimenting with AI-assisted coding to port basic docs-as-code elements to old operating systems and platforms, such as the venerable Intel 386. While this might strike you as a bizarre display of futility, I find this sort of retrocomputing exercise to be quite beneficial, if not enlightening. Something just clicks when you stop and walk backwards.</description>

      <title>Measuring power network frequency using junk you have in your&amp;#160;closet</title>
      <link>https://halcy.de/blog/2025/02/09/measuring-power-network-frequency-using-junk-you-have-in-your-closet/</link>
      <description>Over the weekend starting on Saturday, the 8th of February 2025, the Baltic states’ electricity grid is switching from being synchronized with the Russian electric grid to being synchronized with the continental European electrical grid. This involves first disconnecting from the Russian grid, then operating a while as an island system, regulating the frequency alone and doing various tests, and finally, synchronizing frequency and phase with the EU grid and throwing the breaker. Which made me wonder earlier today: How hard would it be to watch the frequency&amp;#160;changing?</description>

      <title>Event Driven Architecture Rules of Thumb</title>
      <link>https://joshghent.com/eda-rules-of-thumb/</link>
      <description>Event driven architectures are a fantastic mechanism for powering decoupled services. But they depend on the contract - the actual data points within each event.
As with these sorts of things, there is always an &amp;quot;it depends&amp;quot; of what data should go within events. Therefore, this guide is not prescriptive and should be followed as a &amp;quot;rules of thumb&amp;quot; - guiding principles, not rules.</description>

      <link>https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2025/02/10/love-the-llm/</link>
      <description>I believe that AI-powered development tools can be a game changer for Rust—and vice versa. At its core, my argument is simple: AI’s ability to explain and diagnose problems with rich context can help people get over the initial bump of learning Rust in a way that canned diagnostics never could, no matter how hard we try. At the same time, rich type systems like Rust’s give AIs a lot to work with, which could be used to help them avoid hallucinations and validate their output. This post elaborates on this premise and sketches out some of the places where I think AI could be a powerful boost.</description>

      <description>I was chatting with someone from a startup last year, where it is normal for team members to put in extra long hours (60+ hour weeks). The founder and CEO said, “I wish it wasn’t like this, but it is what we need to do right now.” I was a bit shocked by this. He knew it was not healthy but did not see any alternative.
