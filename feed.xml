      <title>Coding Shorts: Speeding Up the Editor in Visual Studio 2022 
</title>
      <link>https://wildermuth.com/2022/05/03/speeding-up-the-editor-in-visual-studio-2022/</link>
      <description>Visual Studio 2022 is frustrating me. Not only does debugging sometimes take way too long, but, for me, the real problem is that the editor is trying to do too much to help me. I just want to be able to type code.

      <title>The Pareto PM - Jon Douglas</title>
      <link>https://jondouglas.dev/the-pareto-pm/</link>
      <description>As I reflect upon the last 5 years, one of the biggest themes that sticks out is whether a PM is thinking in outputs or outcomes.An early in career PM may be thinking purely in outputs. How many features can we build? How many bugs can we fix in this release? How many interviews should I do? And so on.Later in career PM tend to think in outcomes. What features will bring the most impact this year? What bugs will solve most of our user’s issues? What type of interviews will bring answers our teams need? This is what I can best define as a “Pareto PM”. For those unfamiliar, the pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule simply states that 80% of the outcomes come from 20% of the causes.</description>

      <link>https://muscaw.dev/2022/05/01/setup-mypy-for-fun-and-profit/</link>
      <description>Have you ever written Python code and had to dig deep into callstacks to understand what the return type of a function is?
I know I did and unfortunately, it makes me slower overall because I always have to dig through the callstack to understand what I’m dealing with. This also makes the code sensibly more complex given the number of additional checks that need to be implemented to assert a returned value is of an expected type.</description>

Mount Sanitas Summit west, Boulder, CO  I enjoy life in large part thanks to friends I made on the internet. These friendships have led to jobs, romantic adventures, stays in dreamy oceanside villas, global hackathons, and countless transformative and wonderful experiences.</description>

      <description>You cannot realise that, but your computer has a battery inside it only to get your computer clock running. Back in the 90s, when the rechargeable (lithium-ion) battery was not cheap, we used to disassemble our computers to replace their clock battery when the computer could not keep the clock “on time” anymore. Yeah, your computer clock is a “thing”.</description>

      <title>What&amp;#39;s two-adicity?</title>
      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/559/whats-two-adicity/</link>
      <description>Some elliptic curves (related to zero-knowledge proofs I believe) have been claiming high 2-adicity. But for some reason, it seems a bit hard to find a definition of what this term means. And oddly, it&amp;#39;s not a complicated thing to explain. So here&amp;#39;s a short note about it.
You can see this being mentioned for example by the pasta curves:

They have the same 2-adicity, 32, unlike the Tweedle curves  ...</description>

      <description>Blazor is arguably the hottest technology in the .NET world right now, and for good reason. It brings the missing piece of the puzzle to ASP.NET—A true client-side UI framework which allows developers to author applications with C# instead of JavaScript. Since its initial release in September 2019, it&amp;#39;s grown massively in popularity as well as features. With .NET 6, developers will even be able to use their existing skills with Blazor to go beyond the web and create desktop applications!</description>

      <title>OPT: Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068</link>
      <description>Large language models, which are often trained for hundreds of thousands of
compute days, have shown remarkable capabilities for zero- and few-shot
learning. Given their computational cost, these models are difficult to
replicate without significant capital. For the few that are available through
APIs, no access is granted to the full model weights, making them difficult to
study. We present Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only
pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters, which we aim to
fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We show that OPT-175B
is comparable to GPT-3, while requiring only 1/7th the carbon footprint to
develop. We are also releasing our logbook detailing the infrastructure
challenges we faced, along with code for experimenting with all of the released
models.</description>

      <title>C#: Add event handlers dynamically using reflection</title>

Rather than manually write the repetitive code to attach the handlers I decided to cheat and use reflection. Since there wasn’t anything immediately available online that I could find, I’m sharing an example here to show how to do it.</description>
