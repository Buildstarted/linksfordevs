      <title>Conditionally setting your gitconfig</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/conditional-gitconfig/</link>
      <description>Personally, I try to keep my development environment as convenient to use as possible and with the advent of BeyondCorp-style zero trust, more internal services are thankfully available without a VPN required.
This makes it easy to access tooling from your mobile device and other places but it can also mean the line between work and personal blurs a little bit.
A lot of my custom work-related configuration has been deprecated (utilities for wrangling VPNs and proxies) and I basically don’t maintain anything more than what was already open sourced.</description>

      <title>With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility: Platforms Want To Be Utilities, Self-Govern Like Empires</title>

      <description>Whether it’s “bringing the world closer together” (Facebook), “organizing the world’s information” (Google), to be a market “where customers can find and discover anything they might want to buy online” (Amazon) or “to make personal computing accessible to each and every individual” (Apple), the founding missions of tech giants reveal a desire to become indispensable to our digital lives.</description>
