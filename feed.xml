That goes for feature requests on open source projects, on unpaid internships, and on unpaid &amp;#39;take home&amp;#39; interview assignments.

      <title>Notes On Owning Your Own Business</title>
      <link>https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/small_bus_blog_post/</link>
      <description>So, you want to strike out on your own, and start your own business?  Great!  Here are a few things you might want to know about that.  They are based on my own experience as an independent contractor (computer programmer), what I&amp;#39;ve seen being married to an owner (with a partner) of a small retail shop, and what I&amp;#39;ve seen and heard talking to multiple small business owners of various kinds in the last twenty years.  Some of them are successful, some of them were not, and some were successful but didn&amp;#39;t like it, and stopped.  The recurring thing I&amp;#39;ve seen (and my own lived experience) is that owning and running your own business is not what most people think it is like, so perhaps this will be useful to you as you set out on a different path.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Linear Algebra for Applied Machine Learning with Python</title>
      <link>https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-linear-algebra</link>
      <description>Linear algebra is to machine learning as flour to bakery: every machine learning model is based in linear algebra, as every cake is based in flour. It is not the only ingredient, of course. Machine learning models need vector calculus, probability, and optimization, as cakes need sugar, eggs, and butter. Applied machine learning, like bakery, is essentially about combining these mathematical ingredients in clever ways to create useful (tasty?) models.</description>

      <title>My strategy for playing Settlers of Catan | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201111-01/?p=104441</link>
      <description>My general strategy for playing Settlers of Catan is to take my unused road, settlement, and city tokens and try to build a robot out of them. I have yet to win with this strategy, but I like it nevertheless. (I don’t buy many development cards because I haven’t figured out how to use them to build a robot.)</description>

      <title>The hidden callout: The destructor | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201111-00/?p=104439</link>
      <description>This is a general problem, but I’m going to give a specific example. C++ standard library collections do not support concurrent mutation. It is the caller’s responsibility to serialize mutation operations, and to ensure that no mutation occurs at the same time as any other operation.</description>
