      <title>Building a WoW server in Elixir</title>
      <link>https://pikdum.dev/posts/thistle-tea/</link>
      <description>Thistle Tea is my new World of Warcraft private server project.
You can log in, create a character, run around, and cast spells to kill mobs, with everything synchronized between players as expected for an MMO.
It was floating around in my head to build this for a while, since I have an incurable nostalgia for early WoW.
I first mentioned this on May 13th and didn’t expect to get any further than login, character creation, and spawning into the map.
Here’s a recount of the first month of development.</description>

      <title>GUIs are Antisocial</title>
      <link>https://mtlynch.io/notes/guis-are-antisocial/</link>
      <description>
    
      Last week, I was listening to the CoRecursive podcast interview with PowerShell’s lead architect, Jeffrey Snover.
One moment in that interview has been stuck in my head the whole week is when Snover argues that graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are inherently “antisocial”:
I realized that — you know, that the mouse is antisocial. The GUI is antisocial. So what’s that mean? You have a problem to solve, and you solve it with the GUI.
