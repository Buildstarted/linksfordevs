      <title>Keyless Entity Types in EF Core: Query Data Without Primary Keys - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/keyless-entity-types-in-ef-core-query-data-without-primary-keys/</link>
      <description>Not everything in your database needs a primary key. Sometimes, you just want to query views, stored procedures, or raw SQL results without forcing a unique identifier on them. That’s where Keyless Entity Types in EF Core come in! If you’ve ever struggled with querying database views, reports, or read-only datasets, this feature is exactly what you need. Let’s dive into what Keyless Entity Types are, when to use them, and how to make them work in EF Core.</description>

      <title>Marshmallow Test and Parenting - @desunit (Sergey Bogdanov)</title>
      <link>https://desunit.com/blog/marshmallow-test-and-parenting/</link>
      <description>Today, when my 1.9-year-old daughter tried to grab and eat an unwashed orange, I asked her to give it to me so I could wash and peel it if she could wait for a moment. She did. It got me thinking about the marshmallow experiment, where the idea was that patience equals success. But … […]</description>

      <title>Bad Code is Better Than Vibe Code - Developer forever</title>
      <link>https://manidoraisamy.com/developer-forever/post/bad-code-is-better-than-vibe-code.anc-c12b8fd2-d4b0-4aa5-8f8d-219f9e9367c0.html</link>
      <description>Developers are increasingly relying on AI to generate code from natural language prompts—a practice known as vibe coding. This hands-off approach is creating a generation of developers who don&amp;#39;t fully understand their own code. A couple of years ago, I wrote:AI takeover won&amp;#39;t be like Skynet, but it might still have the same effect. It&amp;#39;ll start with small improvements to UX by suggesting what user wants. But as accuracy increases, users will get hooked &amp;amp; delegate all decision making to AI.Still, I am surprised by how fast this has happened, and the fact that coding is one of the first domains affected. Just as companies once became locked into Oracle databases, unable to migrate away due to deep dependencies, today&amp;#39;s startups risk becoming permanently dependent on AI code generators. But since the market has embraced the code generation path, we should at least take a more reasonable approach—write bad code first, then let AI refine it, instead of writing everything in English and losing our understanding of code.The Problem with Vibe CodingVibe coding sounds great—just describe what you want, and AI writes the code. But over time, this leads to:No understanding – You don&amp;#39;t know how the code works, only the requirements you wrote in English. When something breaks, you&amp;#39;re stuck debugging AI&amp;#39;s work instead of your own, which often becomes more time-consuming than writing your own code from scratch.No learning – If you never engage with code, what’s the difference between you and the end user? Why can’t the end user cut out the middleman (you) and do it themselves?To be fair, vibe coding has its merits—non-technical founders can build MVPs and get their startups off the ground before hiring engineering talent. However, this initial convenience often comes at the cost of long-term technical debt and dependency.Start with a Brittle ToyInstead of vibe coding, writing brittle code to build an MVP is a much better option. Here’s an example: My 11-year-old son built a game called Flappy Snowman using Scratch. At first, he was comfortable with drag-and-drop blocks in Scratch. But as his game became popular, he realized it was too slow. He wanted to make it faster, so he decided to learn C# and rebuild it using the Unity game engine.Now, imagine if AI could help him translate his Scratch project into Unity, step by step. Even with very little understanding of C#, he would still be able to grasp the code by mapping his Scratch blocks to corresponding C# logic. Through this process:He can still understand his game’s logic because he started with something he built himself.He can learn better coding practices by seeing how AI translates Scratch logic into C# logic.He stays in control of the development, rather than outsourcing the thinking to AI.This is the difference between bad code and vibe coding. One keeps developers engaged. The other turns them into passengers.Grow it into a DragonIncidentally, this is how Mark Zuckerberg got started. He built Facebook using PHP, and once it took off, he hired brilliant engineers who developed HipHop Virtual Machine, which transpiles PHP into C++, significantly improving performance and scalability. This allowed Facebook to scale to billions of users. If a planetary-scale company can be built by a teenager using PHP, imagine what AI-based transpilers can do for young founders of the future.Startup founders can rapidly prototype and launch MVPs while maintaining an understanding of their codebase, which is essential for future iterations and scaling. For learners and beginners, AI can serve as a bridge, helping translate simpler languages like Scratch or PHP into  scalable backend solutions. This approach doesn’t force everyone to write optimized code from the start—it allows developers to begin with what they know and improve incrementally.SummaryThe Y2K crisis of the late 1990s was not just a bug fix—it birthed an entire industry. As companies scrambled to fix COBOL systems that couldn&amp;#39;t handle the year 2000, Indian IT firms like TCS and Infosys stepped in. They started by fixing Y2K-related bugs, but in the process, they built expertise in maintaining and modernizing legacy systems. This led to long-term contracts, outsourcing deals, and eventually a shift from services to full-fledged product development. What began as “fixing bad code” evolved into a multi-billion-dollar industry that put India on the global tech map.Now imagine if AI had existed then, automatically fixing every Y2K bug with a single prompt. No learning. No skill development. No transformation. Just a quick fix that left no lasting impact. That’s the choice we face today. We can use AI to paper over our limitations, or we can use it to enhance our capabilities. We can let it write our code, or we can let it teach us to write better code. We can become passive consumers of AI’s output, or we can remain active creators who use AI to push our boundaries. The code we write today shapes not just our software, but our future as creators.</description>

      <title>How I Automated My Computer Life With macOS Folder Actions</title>
      <link>https://interfacecraft.online/posts/blog/2025/how-i-automated-my-computer-life-with-macos-folder-actions/</link>
      <description>I’ve always believed that computers should handle repetitive tasks better than humans. It frustrates me when something can’t be automated the way I want or when simple actions require more effort than they should.
Let’s say we want to convert one video format to another. This happens to me often when I need to share a screencast video with colleagues on Slack. By default, macOS records in .MOV format, which is too large for sharing on Slack.</description>

      <title>.NET Conf 2024 - Day 2</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=aSj4Z8MMfkQ</link>
      <description>Full agenda: https://dotnetconf.net/agenda

.NET Conf has been a virtual event since the beginning, and this year we’re celebrating our 14th online conference. We always strive to create a world class, engaging, virtual experience for all our attendees no matter where they are. Over the years we&amp;#39;ve expanded our content and our reach. We now draw over 100 thousand live viewers and sponsor hundreds of local events around the world.

Over the course of the three days we provide a wide selection of live sessions that feature speakers from the community and .NET team members. We have sessions streaming 24/7 between day two and three of the conference so everyone can get involved no matter what their time zone. You can ask questions live on Twitter, join the fun on Twitch, attend the virtual attendee parties where you can play trivia games and win prizes. Best of all, you can take what you learn here and be a better .NET developer.
