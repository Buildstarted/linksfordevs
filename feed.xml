      <title>Delegate, Action, Func, Lamdba expression - What the heck!?</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/aa77f7fb-41a7-47d2-8e48-ef9e101cf08e</link>
      <description>C# offers a lot of utility especially around the delegate topic. So let&amp;#39;s see what exactly a delegate is and how the distinct types like delegate, Action, Func, Predicate, anonymous function,  lambda expressions and MulticastDelegate behave. A lot to digest and discover so let&amp;#39;s go.

      <title>Hubble Determines Mass of Isolated Black Hole Roaming Our Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://esahubble.org/news/heic2210/</link>
      <description>Astronomers estimate that 100 million black holes roam among the stars in our Milky Way galaxy, but they have never conclusively identified an isolated black hole. Following six years of meticulous observations, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has, for the first time ever, provided direct evidence for a lone black hole drifting through interstellar space by a precise mass measurement of the phantom object. Until now, all black hole masses have been inferred statistically or through interactions in binary systems or in the cores of galaxies. Stellar-mass black holes are usually found with companion stars, making this one unusual.</description>

      <title>What Makes a Good Research Proposal?</title>
      <link>https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2022/what_makes_a_good_research_proposal.html</link>
      <description>Research is rarely quick: it takes time, people, and (in most cases) equipment to complete. To
convince those in control of the purse strings that we should be given the necessary resources to
tackle a research problem, we create a research proposal. This might
be: a written document, a presentation, or a series of conversations;
presented to academia or industry; and aimed at convincing a manager
or an external funding agency (or even oneself!).</description>

      <title>Using Postgres Schemas | Aaron O. Ellis</title>

      <description>Schemas are a shockingly underappreciated feature of relational databases. With minimal overhead, they enable segmentation and isolation of tables within a database.</description>

      <title>Cranelift, Part 4: A New Register Allocator</title>
      <link>https://cfallin.org/blog/2022/06/09/cranelift-regalloc2/</link>
      <description>This post is the fourth part of a three-part series1 describing
work that I have been doing to improve the
Cranelift
compiler. In this post, I’ll describe the work that went into
regalloc2, a new
register allocator I developed over the past year. The allocator
started as an effort to port IonMonkey’s register
allocator
to Rust and a standalone form usable by Cranelift (“how hard could it
be?”), but quickly evolved during a focused optimization effort to
have its own unique design and implementation aspects.</description>

      <title>Why are nuclear power construction costs so high? Part I</title>
      <link>https://constructionphysics.substack.com/p/why-are-nuclear-power-construction</link>
      <description>Nuclear power currently makes up slightly less than 20% of the total electricity produced in the US, largely from plants built in the 70s and 80s. People are often enthusiastic about greater use of nuclear power as a potential strategy for decarbonizing electricity production, as well as its theoretical potential for being able to produce electricity extremely cheaply. (Nuclear power also has some other attractive qualities, such as less risk of disruption due to fuel-supply issues, which for instance can impact natural gas plants during periods of cold.) But increased use of nuclear power has been hampered by the fact that nuclear power plant construction cost has steadily, dramatically increased over time, frequently over the life of a single project. For instance, in the 1980s</description>
