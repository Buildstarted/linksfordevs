      <title>It is perfectly OK to only code at work, you can have a life too.</title>
      <link>https://zeroequalsfalse.com/posts/it-is-ok-to-only-code-at-work/</link>
      <description>There is often pressure inside Software development for Software developers to code outside of work hours. Whether you are a Python, Ruby, Java, or any other developer... There is absolutely no need to code outside of work if you don't want too. Coding is considered a passion for some, but others they don't think this way. They are more than happy to not read a line of code in their spare time.</description>

      <title>The kernel and BitKeeper part ways</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/130746/</link>
      <description>Back in early 1999, your editor got a call from Larry McVoy.  He was
worried that Linus Torvalds was on the verge of burning out as the kernel
project grew.  The problems in those days were quite evident; Linus, it was
being said, did not scale.  But, according to Larry,
a complete burnout was not inevitable.  If Linus could be given the right
tools, many of his problems (and the frustrations of other kernel
developers) could be solved, and the system would run smoothly again.  The
right tool, according to Larry, was a thing called BitKeeper; if some sort
of agreement could be made on licensing, Larry (along with his company, BitMover)
was willing to make 
BitKeeper available for kernel development.  In fact, Larry wanted to see
BitKeeper used for all free software development; see this article from the 
March 25, 1999 LWN Weekly Edition for a view of how things looked at
that time.</description>

      <description>As a developer, it's nice to be able to create things to make your life easier. I was tired of having to open up my videos just to copy the link and share it. So, I created my first Chrome Extension! It shows me a list of my most recent videos and allows me to copy the link directly!

      <description>Day 1/2
&lt;br&gt;
Cyber-attacks have become a reality of running software on the web today. We find ourselves under a constant barrage of malicious activity from hacktivists, online criminals and increasingly, nation states. Successful attacks from these adversaries are predominantly via flaws in the software products they target ‚Äì flaws that could have been prevented by developers understanding how online attackers work and what the appropriate defensive measures are.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Reactive Extensions for .NET | endjin</title>
      <link>https://endjin.com/what-we-think/talks/reactive-extensions-for-dotnet.html</link>
      <description>The Reactive Extensions for .NET (&amp;quot;Rx&amp;quot; for short) are a set of libraries for working with asynchronous and event-based information sources. While Rx has become widely adopted in client-side code, its roots are in highly scalable server-side processing.
In this talk, Ian Griffiths shows why Rx should be a critical part of any .NET developer's toolbox, and shows a real-world application that illustrates how the powerful processing and orchestration facilities Rx provides can be applied to collect and process data in edge devices and then stream the high-value events to an Azure IoT hub for further analysis in the cloud.

      <title>Tip 273 - Getting started with Azure Image Builder</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip273.html</link>
      <description>Having standard Virtual Machine (VM) images can help you to make sure that your VMs are all configured the same and have the same properties and security policies applied to them. You can create VM images with the Azure Image Builder. This allows you to define VM images in json format, store them somewhere (like in the Azure Shared Image Gallery), build them and deploy them into VMs.</description>

      <title>You don't need this fancy recommendations system</title>
      <link>https://manuel.darcemont.fr/posts/you-dont-need-this-fancy-recommendations-system/</link>
      <description>I spent years on looking for a powerful and accurate recommendations system that would give me the titles of the movies I was desperately needing to bring my film knowledge to completeness (we movie buffs are quite obsessional - and we try to heal ourselves with making lists). The more I discovered new movies and new directors, the more the recommendations engine I was using were proved ineffective.
It looks like we try to address the need for recommendations always with the same tools and the same approach, regardless of the matter.</description>

      <description>At work, I‚Äôve recently been asked to advise our engineers on how to write blog posts. A lot of such articles are already available. However, they tend to focus around two main themes: The technical publishing platform e.g. Jekyll, Medium, etc.Metrics e.g. readability score, SEO, etc. Beyond that, everyone is on one‚Äôs own. But I believe that writing a good technical article is as much art as engineering. In this post, I‚Äôd like to try to address this gap: I‚Äôve been writi</description>
