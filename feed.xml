      <description>A feature that isn&amp;#39;t really new but still didn&amp;#39;t get my attention until recently is: &amp;quot;Central Package Management&amp;quot;.
So let&amp;#39;s have a look at this in this blog post.

      <title>Beware UserDefaults: a tale of hard to find bugs, and lost data</title>
      <link>https://christianselig.com/2024/10/beware-userdefaults/</link>
      <description>Excuse the alarmist title, but I think it’s justified, as it’s an issue that’s caused me a ton of pain in both support emails and actually tracking it down, so I want to make others aware of it so they don’t similarly burned.
Brief intro For the uninitiated, UserDefaults (n&amp;#233;e NSUserDefaults) is the de facto iOS standard for persisting non-sensitive, non-massive data to “disk” (AKA offline). In other words, are you storing some user preferences, maybe your user’s favorite ice cream flavors?</description>

      <title>Personal reflections on moving from Canada to NYC – Daniel Frank</title>
      <link>https://danfrank.ca/personal-reflections-on-moving-from-canada-to-nyc/</link>
      <description>I’m moving from Canada to New York City this week, and I’m having a mini-existential crisis. There are the personal reasons I feel torn—what if I’m lonely, what if I don’t fit in, what if New York doesn’t magically fix the frustrations I had in Toronto, forcing me to confront the horrifying possibility that there’s no “better place”? But there’s also a bigger reason I’m feeling this way.</description>

      <title>Implementing PCA and Dual PCA on CIFAR-10</title>
      <link>https://dmicz.github.io/machine-learning/cifar10-pca/</link>
      <description>This post was adapted from a paper I originally wrote and extended for a school project. The full notebook can be found as a .ipynb file on my GitHub. The post assumes some background knowledge of linear algebra and eigenvalue decomposition. If you don’t have these prerequisites, I highly recommend watching 3Blue1Brown’s playlist on linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Why I Interview Once a Year (Even When I&amp;#39;m Not Job Hunting)</title>
      <link>https://www.fbritoferreira.com/blog/why-i-interview-once-a-year-even-when-not-job-hunting</link>
      <description>In this blog post, I discuss the benefits of conducting annual job interviews, even when you&amp;#39;re not actively job hunting. Regular interviewing helps with market awareness, skill benchmarking, networking, and boosting confidence. It also prepares you for unexpected career changes and strengthens your position in salary negotiations. Openly discussing this practice with your manager fosters transparency, trust, and could lead to internal growth opportunities. This approach is a proactive way to stay competitive and agile in your professional development, without compromising loyalty to your current employer.</description>

      <description>Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools are widely used in modern web development for their convenience in database interactions. However, they can sometimes lead to unexpected and severe performance issues. One such issue is the generation of queries that result in cartesian products, potentially returning an enormous number of rows.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Postgres table layout for maximum efficiency</title>
      <link>https://r.ena.to/blog/optimizing-postgres-table-layout-for-maximum-efficiency/</link>
      <description>Introduction When modeling a Postgres database, you probably don’t give much thought to the order of columns in your tables. After all, it seems like the kind of thing that wouldn’t affect storage or performance. But what if I told you that simply reordering your columns could reduce the size of your tables and indexes by 20%? This isn’t some obscure database trick — it’s a direct result of how Postgres aligns data on disk.

      <link>https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/06/wordpress-vs-acf</link>
      <description>The WordPress drama has not dried up. Since I wrote last, Matt Mullenweg has done a number of interviews, WP Engine sued Automattic, the structure of the WordPress organization has become clearer, and over 150 employees left Automattic in a buy-out deal. Now it seems Mullenweg is going after a popular plugin to try and win his battle against WP Engine.</description>

      <title>Gleam is Pragmatic</title>
      <link>https://blog.drewolson.org/gleam-is-pragmatic/</link>
      <description>I’ve spent the past several years working with functional programming languages
in my free time – primarily Haskell and OCaml. I love both languages but also
find aspects of each frustrating.
Haskell is terse and elegant with type classes providing a powerful mechanism
for ad-hoc polymorphism. However, it can also be confusingly implicit and I
personally find lazy evaluation to have more downsides than upsides.
OCaml is explicit and powerful with a best-in-class module system. However, I
believe it is often exhaustingly explicit, especially when dealing with custom
data types in generic containers.</description>
