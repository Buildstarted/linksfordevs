      <title>How to Run Node.js in VS Code From Scratch</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ7nDNNpOMA</link>
      <description>As you&amp;#39;re learning to program in JavaScript, you&amp;#39;ve probably used an editor in the browser that will run the code for you. However, the next step in your learning process is to learn how to run Node.js JavaScript locally on your machine. What better way to run your code than inside the most popular editor in Web Development, VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/).

In this video, we&amp;#39;ll explore two different ways to run Node.js in VS Code. We&amp;#39;ll run the node command in the terminal manually. Then, we&amp;#39;ll look at the Quokka extension in VS Code to make the process even simpler.

      <title>Why not use GraphQL? | wundergraph</title>
      <link>https://wundergraph.com/blog/why_not_use_graphql</link>
      <description>I think GraphQL will change the world. There will be a future where you can query any system in the world using GraphQL. I&amp;#39;m building this future. So why would I argue against using GraphQL? My personal pet peeve is when the community keeps advertising benefits of GraphQL that are very generic and really have nothing to do with GraphQL. If we want to drive adoption, we should be honest and take off the rose-tinted glasses. This post is a response to &amp;quot;Why use GraphQL&amp;quot; by Kyle Schrade (https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/). It’s not meant to be direct criticism. The article is just an excellent base to work with as it represents opinions I keep hearing a lot in the community. If you read the whole article, it’ll take some time, you’ll fully understand why I think Kyle’s article should be named “Why use Apollo”.</description>

      <title>Deprecating scp</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/835962/9696cdf951f59d63/</link>
      <description>The scp
command, which uses the SSH protocol to
copy files between 
machines, is deeply wired into the fingers of many Linux users and
developers — doubly so for those of us who still think of it as a more
secure replacement for rcp.  Many users may be surprised to learn,
though, that the resemblance to rcp goes beyond the name; much of
the underlying protocol is the same as well.  That protocol is showing its
age, and the OpenSSH community has
considered it deprecated for a while. 
Replacing scp in a way that keeps users happy may not be an easy
task, though.</description>

      <link>https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html</link>
      <description>When a new Certificate Authority (CA) comes on the scene, it faces a conundrum: In order to be useful to people, it needs its root certificate to be trusted by a wide variety of operating systems (OSes) and browsers. However, it can take years for the OSes and browsers to accept the new root certificate, and even longer for people to upgrade their devices to the newer versions that include that change.</description>

The Channels Discussed:
KM Daily
Happy Dog
The Rescue Journey TV
pabloxito17
Love Rescue Animals
yorquy
Animal Lighthouse
Little Furry Friends
Animal SafeGaurd
The Rescue Journey
