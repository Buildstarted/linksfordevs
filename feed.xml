      <link>https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/</link>
      <description>I don’t know about you, but nothing gets me going in the morning quite like a
good old fashioned programming language rant. It stirs the blood to see someone
skewer one of those “blub” languages the plebians use, muddling through
their day with it between furtive visits to StackOverflow.</description>

      <title>My Janet Story | Jungle Coder</title>
      <link>https://junglecoder.com/blog/my-janet-story</link>
      <description>Since Advent of Code in 2020, I’ve been doing 95% of my hobby programming in a language called Janet, which not even I woud have predicted before that. I’d just broken my “heavily multithreaded or bust” phase by using Ruby for a few things, after having been big on Nim, which I gave up because of not feeling at home in the web-development frameworks it has. Both are fine languages in their own right, but where not where my brain wanted to be. Then, I thought I’d give Janet a try during AoC 2020. I’d tried lisps in the past. (And yes, despite what the Common Lisp community has to say, Janet is a lisp, even if it’s not a Lisp), but none of them ever quite stuck for me.</description>
