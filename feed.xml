      <description>Full code on Github: https://github.com/wiwa/blog-code/blog-bitonic

Hi Link to heading Recently, I finished a batch at the Recurse Center… is what I would have said if this post were written when I intended to write it (i.e. 3 months ago). My project there focused on a questionable application of CUDA (mostly irrelevant to this post), but it got me thinking more about other GPU-friendly algorithms.
Instead of my Recurse project (which I hope to write about in a later post), I want to simply begin writing about technical stuff I’ve played around with.</description>
