      <title>March 6, 2020 - Minimal March - Building a Blazor CommandButton component on a Chromebook</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh7CcVrsX7A</link>
      <description>Fritz works on Blazor components in this stream, adding samples and working on a CommandButton for the BlazorWebFormsComponents.  The Twitch chat room challenges him and the squirrel costume makes another appearance.

Questions:
32:50 - I tried to install IntelliJ on my chrome book.
52:00 -  If it&amp;#39;s an official command, it should have official docs.
1:03:33 - You know the difference between .NET and .NET Core
1:07:57 - It would be nice if cognitive services could turn your documentation into work items and changes to the docs could drive new work items.

      <title>March 5, 2020 - Minimal March - Customizing tmux and Live Coding .NET on a Chromebook</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5rb1IwprA</link>
      <description>Tmux is the Terminal Multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems, and allows you to configure your terminal with window panes, additional windows, and navigation between them.  Fritz writes a configuration file today that fits his style of work and add the git status to the tmux status bar.

You can find his tmux configuration on GitHub at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf

Blog post about .NET on a Chromebook: https://jeffreyfritz.com/2020/03/minimal-march-part-2-net-on-a-chromebook/

Questions:
16:30 - If the powerful Chromebooks weren&amp;#39;t so expensive to have a secondary computer I&amp;#39;d get one. 
52:24 - Reload tmux configuration with: Bind R source-file ~/.tmux.config \; display-message &amp;quot;Config reloaded...&amp;quot;
1:02:38 - .NET Core or .NET Framework?
1:45:06 - I have a challenge I&amp;#39;m not sure can easily be met - C# development On an android device.
1:45:41 - I think we can all agree that you can develop on anything, except an iPad.
1:48:50 - VSOnline pricing would be likely put it out of reach for someone who only owns a smartphone and can&amp;#39;t afford a computer.
1:58:50 - Printing to the console is far slower than people realize.
2:20:48 - Could you give me some tips on how to start, what should I learn and use to make my life easier?
2:27:27 - Maybe it&amp;#39;s a good idea to create some Linux already set up for development.

      <title>The Curious Case of Commands and Cancellation</title>
      <link>http://www.roji.org/db-commands-and-cancellation</link>
      <description>Async brought a world of goodness (and complexity) to .NET, including the concept of cancellation: since async operations are by their nature supposed to take a while, it makes sense to allow us to cancel mid-way and exit early. Like async in general, cancellation took some time to propagate everywhere - socket operations only started honoring cancellation token in .NET Core 3.0. For the upcoming 5.0 release of Npgsql, the PostgreSQL database driver, a lot of work is going on to provide a good command cancellation story (thanks @vonzshik!!), and it is far more complicated than you’d think.</description>

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ilxMfsAHE</link>
      <description>In this stream, Fritz connects Azure DevOps to a GitHub registry and deploys a new container to Azure App Service whenever an update to the BlazorWebFormsComponents samples is made.

View the new website at:  https://blazorwebformscomponents.azurewebsites.net/

17:09 - GitHub &amp;#39;almost works&amp;#39; it&amp;#39;s hit and miss, you may or may not have success with it.
51:21 - Wrote a T4 template that generates constants from that Javascript file. It&amp;#39;s a bit rough but interesting as a proof of concept.
54:33 - T4 = Totally Tubular Template Thing, or something like it, right?
1:450:07 - I&amp;#39;ve never had a good experience with azure dev ops.
1:52:20 - YAML is the 7th circle of hell.
2:29:50 - Anyone with admin permissions to a repository can delete a version of a private package in that repository.

      <title>March 4, 2020 - Minimal March - Live Coding .NET on a Chromebook</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7kUuQsyGnw</link>
      <description>Minimal March continues with Fritz working with .NET Core and C# on a Chromebook.  Today he&amp;#39;s talking about how he bricked and rebuilt the Chromebook after the last episode.  We build some scripts to automate builds and tests for the project, and Fritz even installs Visual Studio Code on the Chromebook and shows how easy it is to get productive with minimal hardware.

Questions:
12:17 - There were incidents where fonts were used to inject viruses into operating systems. Maybe that is why they are protecting it a bit.
 23:23 - If you&amp;#39;re trying to see if it&amp;#39;s for you, spending 1000$ instead of 50$ isn&amp;#39;t reasonable, especially if you don&amp;#39;t have 1000$.
23:44 - When I teach people I try to ease the environment burden as much as possible. 
24:39 - Make it easy for newcomers to fall into the pit of success.
24:51 - I really wish Apple would open their ecosystem. I&amp;#39;d love to write something for an iPhone without having a mac.
1:08:48 - Have you considered the pi4 4gb?
1:10:40 - What are good resources you might suggest for learning about keeping things consistent and synchronized in a space where multiple instances of the web application are running and you might post to a different server than you got from?
1:16:00 - The customer reserves a specific unit, but if the eventual consistency then it might already be reserved?
1:22:36 - Which Linux distribution would you recommend for developing ASP.NET CORE projects?
1:55:50 - What is Omnisharp?

      <description>You know how some people are what you&amp;#39;d call &amp;quot;house proud&amp;quot; in that they like everything very neat and organised? You walk in there and everything is in its place, nice and clean without clutter.

      <title>Someone Masquerading as me on Indeed and LinkedIn</title>
      <link>http://thedatafarm.com/just-rambling/someone-masquerading-as-me-on-indeed-and-linkedin/</link>
      <description>I have recently been contacted by multiple people who have been getting scam virtual assistant job offers on Indeed and LinkedIn from someone using the email address julielerman101@hotmail.com. And they are attempting some standard scammy tasks like “here’s a check” (which is fake) ” please deposit it then transfer $ to [some weird place]”. Please don’t be taken in. It is not me. I don’t have accounts on any of those websites. Indeed.com has been alerted and have done something about that account. If you have been contacted by anyone like this, let me know.&amp;#160; And I’m so sorry. &amp;#128577;</description>

      <description>Remastered version of my BICFest 2018 talk about how the collision system of The Witness was engineered to prevent entire classes of bugs normally found in game engines of its type.


The original talk recording was essentially useless because the audio was corrupted.  This version has been resurrected from video and audio recordings I had made for the simultaneous translators to use.  I&amp;#39;d forgotten they existed, but thankfully rediscovered them recently.

      <title>How robots made this food commercial look effortless</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuEyrLbJ25w</link>
      <description>Creating the perfect food commercial isn’t just a matter of great styling and a mouth-watering dish. Sometimes, you need a robot.

Steve Giralt is a “visual engineer.” Check out his Instagram for more:
https://www.instagram.com/stevegiralt/?hl=en

Or explore his website as he starts working on educational content about his work:
https://www.thegaragelearning.com/

Giralt began his career as a stills photographer, but he saw potential for more thanks to his hobbies in engineering. A new discipline was born: visual engineering, using robotics, advanced camerawork, and a lot of creativity to create moving images that have never been seen before. His Smores have lit up Times Square, and, in the video above, you can watch how he uses trial and error (and more than a few robots) to drop the perfect lime.

Giralt’s toolkit includes Arduino programming, Maya, welding, epoxies, super-expensive cameras that can shoot incredible slow motion, and a lot of elbow grease and ingenuity. This form of commercial art shows how technology can make incredible images happen — and you don’t always need computer graphics to do it.

      <title>TDD for ELT – Kaminsky</title>
      <link>https://kaminsky.rocks/2020/09/tdd-for-elt/</link>
      <description>I’m a big fan of test-driven development for lots of reasons. In addition to helping you clearly define your goals in advance and encouraging you to write as little code as possible, I love the documenting nature of tests. If your project is well tested, you don’t need documentation (at least for other developers) — they can simply look at the tests and observe the enforced behavior of the code.</description>

      <title>The Irrationality Of Risk</title>
      <link>https://moritzwolf.com/how-to-deal-with-the-irrationality-of-risk</link>
      <description>2020 was risky. COVID-19 posed a threat for many, not only to fall sick and threaten your health but also to destroy you economically. However, not all people did respond rationally. I think that how to take calculated risk is one of the most important skills to learn. But it seems that this skill is not as common.</description>

      <title>The Case against Low Priority Alerts &amp;#183; Utsav&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://utsavshah.com/2020/10/12/case-against-low-priority-alerts/</link>
      <description>PagerDuty and other alerting systems let users specify the priority of an alert. High priority alerts are supposed to page an engineer (“the site is down”), and low priority alerts are meant to warn users of impending issues - PagerDuty’s example for a low priority alert is “An SSL certificate is due to expire in one week”. In theory, a low priority alert is one that an oncall engineer looks at when there’s no high priority alerts to take care of, and resolves their root cause via some kind of change.</description>
