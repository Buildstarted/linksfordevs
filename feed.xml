      <title>Free Educational Content in Minecraft Marketplace!</title>
      <link>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/free-educational-content-minecraft-marketplace-</link>
      <description>The world is upside down right now. We‚Äôre learning lots of new phrases like social distancing, contact tracing, and stop snacking just because you‚Äôre bored. Everyone around the world is coming together to do their part, whether that‚Äôs working on finding a vaccine, delivering food and supplies, or staying indoors. Whatever the case, all of our daily routines have been thrown completely out of whack. It‚Äôs easy to get scared at a time like this, which is why focusing on something can help you stay calm.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Depth Buffers</title>
      <link>https://miketuritzin.com/post/hierarchical-depth-buffers/</link>
      <description>Overview A hierarchical depth buffer is a multi-level depth (Z) buffer used as an acceleration structure for depth queries. As with normal texture mip chains, the dimensions of each level are generally successive power-of-2 fractions of the full-resolution buffer‚Äôs dimensions. In this article I present two techniques for generating a hierarchical depth buffer from a full-resolution one.
First I show how to generate the full mip chain for a depth buffer in a way that preserves depth query accuracy in texture coordinate (or NDC) space even for non-power-of-2 depth buffer dimensions.</description>

deeply satisfying to anyone who enjoys writing software. And it turns out
that creating such a program from scratch is easier than it sounds. The
hardest part is figuring out where to start. In this tutorial, I'll show
you how to write, build and run the classic "Hello, World!" in pure
assembly.</description>

      <title>The man who made the NES</title>
      <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-03-15-the-man-who-made-the-nes</link>
      <description>Maybe it's about being in the right place at the right time. How else to explain how Masayuki Uemura, an engineer born in wartime Japan to a humble background, came to change the course of video game history? Uemura is the man who designed the Famicom, a pivotal piece of plastic whose legacy can be seen throughout the modern industry; in many ways, it's the machine that defined modern Nintendo. "You know, it's only when someone like you comes along and asks a lot of questions that makes me think maybe I was a part of some big thing," he says with no small amount of modesty as we chat in a small, quiet space on the ground floor of Sheffield's Castle House.</description>

      <description>Governor Ralph Northam today issued a statewide order to protect the health and safety of Virginians and reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19. Executive Order Fifty-Three orders the closure of certain non-essential businesses, bans all gatherings of more than 10 people, and closes all K-12 schools for the remainder of the academic year. Governor Northam is also urging all Virginians to avoid non-essential travel outside the home, if and when possible.</description>
