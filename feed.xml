      <description>The other day Jen Simmons solicited some open feedback about WebKit, asking what they might “need to add / change / fix / invent to help you?” First of all — brave. Brave of Jen to open her timeline up for everyone to vomit their opinions and snark. I, too, contributed my own bits of vomit to the thread.</description>

      <title>Hopalongs - koppian adventures</title>
      <link>http://hkopp.github.io/2021/05/hopalongs</link>
      <description>Back, when the internet was still small and i was still a pupil I had an intense fascination with fractals. Among others, I worked on so called hopalongs. These are orbits of a special map. They were discovered by Barry Martin of Aston University in Birmingham. In 1986 they were popularized in the Scientific American by the well-known recreational mathematician Dewdney.
The hopalong map is iteratively applied to a point (x,y) and the resulting points are plotted. The hopalong map takes three parameters, a, b, and c. Interestingly, the final image does not really depend on the starting point, but is very sensitive to changes in the parameters.</description>
