      <title>Engineering a chess match against my brother</title>
      <link>https://blog.mbrt.dev/posts/chess-eng/</link>
      <description>This is the story of me trying to win a game of chess against my brother. A single freaking game. What’s so special about it? Am I good at chess? Not at all. Did I improve at my game in the process? Also no. Is it a story about “the journey rather than the destination”? Not really. Did I at least have fun in the process? Not so sure. This is the story of me trying to be unconventional at probably the most studied game in existence and using my software engineering background for something that probably doesn’t need it.</description>

Ultimately, knowledge is paralysing.&amp;quot; - Calvin A month ago I decided to try and get out of the reading slump I have been in - slump is a kind description for what has been a half-decade period of me not picking up a book.

      <title>A Project of One&amp;#39;s Own</title>
      <link>http://paulgraham.com/own.html</link>
      <description>A few days ago, on the way home from school, my nine year old son
told me he couldn&amp;#39;t wait to get home to write more of the story he
was working on. This made me as happy as anything I&amp;#39;ve heard him
say — not just because he was excited about his story, but because
he&amp;#39;d discovered this way of working. Working on a project of your
own is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking.
It&amp;#39;s more fun, but also much more productive.</description>

      <title>Clever vs Insightful Code • Hillel Wayne</title>
      <link>https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/cleverness/</link>
      <description>“Don’t write clever code.” Why not? “Because it’s hard to understand.” People who say this think of clever code such as Duff’s Device:



Duff&amp;#39;s Device

send(to, from, count) register short *to, *from; register count; { register n = (count + 7) / 8; switch (count % 8) { case 0: do { *to = *from++; case 7: *to = *from++; case 6: *to = *from++; case 5: *to = *from++; case 4: *to = *from++; case 3: *to = *from++; case 2: *to = *from++; case 1: *to = *from++; } while (--n &amp;gt; 0); } }  
This code is “clever” because it exploits knowledge about the language, in this case the peculiarities of fall-through.</description>
