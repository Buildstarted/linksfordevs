      <title>September 21st! A Charity Fundraiser</title>
      <link>https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/september-21st/</link>
      <description>Five years, five September videos. A nice round number, and a perfect place for me to stop. There's only so much dancing I can do—my knees are getting bad and I am running out of closet space for all these decorations!  

That said, one of the nicest things about doing these September videos is using the attention as an opportunity to raise money for organizations whose goals I want to champion, whether that's fighting climate change, resources and rights of the unhoused, trans equality &amp;amp; political power, racial justice, reproductive rights, prisoner justice, or a variety of other social goods. So I will keep these September videos going for another year, by challenging you all to help me raise $50,000 for a few select organizations listed here. If we hit $50,000, I'll make another video! If we hit $100,000, uhhh, I'll make another video but also probably freak out because—wow!—that's a lot of money! If we hit $69,420, well...I’ll make another video, and have myself a giggle. (I’m only human.)  Please contribute! Anything helps, even a single dollar! It's a crucial time in our history for so many marginalized and underrepresented voices, and a little bit can go a long way in pushing the needle closer to a socially, politically, and environmentally just world. Thank you so much for your support, I love you!  

P.S.– if you can, VOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!  (Thank you to Erik Abriss + Ian Carr of Street Watch LA for helping me set up this fundraiser!) </description>

      <title>February 21, 2020 - Blazor and interesting differences from Web Forms</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_q7God8lHg</link>
      <description>Fritz picks up where he left off after the power outage in the prior episode and starts tinkering with the idea of building UserControls in Blazor.  What complexities does that introduce?

17:11 - Never be dependent on a specific person to deploy your code.
24:23 - Had an issue yesterday with a YAML file in my Flutter project it wouldn't build. I was missing a single space.
35:30 - Devil's advocate the target audience for YAML.

      <description>LIVE from Channel 9 studios at Microsoft headquarters, Jeff is back and talking about running .NET on a Linux-based laptop.

11:38 - Confusion probably comes from the naming.
16:20 - Standard is like interface, and .NET Core is the implementation. Rough explanation.
22:15 - Have you've done some Blazor pages using the MobileBlazorBinding the one that uses Xamarian Essentials?
24:12 - Love talking about non-VS tools!

      <description>macOS is my operating system of choice, but oddly I do most of my professional programming with the .NET Framework. Historically, the choice of Macs paired with .NET would raise eyebrows, but not anymore. The release of .NET Core has made the .NET ecosystem more welcoming of folks with other operating systems.</description>

      <title>Claudius Mbemba - What They Don't Teach You About Fundraising as a Black Founder [w/ASL]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZL9ylxY6XU</link>
      <description>useneu.com has made 3 attempts at raising capital for our business. Each attempt brought with it some valuable, and often unintuitive, lessons about the fundraising process. Join me as I recount our fundraising experiences and the main lessons learned after each one. Should you ever need to fundraise, you'll know the key DOs and DONTs.
---
Claudius Mbemba was born in Cameroon, Africa to hard-working blue-collar parents who taught him the value of hard work, being a self-starter, and always learning. Immigrating to the US at the age of 7, Claudius saw how technology vastly improved the lives of Americans. It was then his love for technology was born. Following high school, Claudius pursued his Bachelors Degree in Computer Science while on the Varsity Football team at The Ohio State University. Upon completing his degree he accepted employment at Microsoft in Seattle, WA where he worked as a Software Engineer, largely focusing his time on Voice, Mobile, Cloud, Bots, DevOps, ML/AI, &amp; Blockchain. Claudius is currently CTO of Neu Inc, a startup building a marketplace that provides automated hotel-grade turnovers for Airbnb/vacation rentals.
