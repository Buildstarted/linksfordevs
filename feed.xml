      <title>Length Extension Attacks | Tiago Neto</title>
      <link>https://tiagofneto.com/posts/length-extension/</link>
      <description>Cryptographic hash functions are indispensable building blocks in the field of cryptography, designed to fulfill essential security properties. Various families of cryptographic hash functions exist, each with its own construction mechanism and security guarantees. Among the potential vulnerabilities, the “Length Extension Attack” is particularly significant. Understanding this particular attack is not only crucial for mitigating certain security risks but also for making informed design choices in cryptographic systems.</description>

      <description>There is an idea floating around, which has some traction, that LLM intelligence
is illusory. LLMs are an impressive piece of technology, capable of generating
text of higher quality than an average person. As is common—when the magic
wears off and the initial hype dies down—a counter culture forms around the
best ideas of cynics, skeptics, and those who were never impressed.</description>

      <description>In the quest for software optimization, a trusty companion is the sampling profiler, a tool available in most programming languages. These profilers work unobtrusively, taking snapshots of the program’s state and recording the currently executing function or instruction.</description>

      <description>If you ask anyone what the best Emacs packages are, you’ll almost definitely hear Magit (the only Git porcelain worth using) and Org Mode (a way to organize anything and everything in plain text) listed as #1 and #2. And they’re right! I use those packages extensively every day.
Besides those two powerhouses, there are a handful of packages that make using Emacs a delight. If I had to ever use something else, I would miss these packages most:</description>
