      <title>Read it later the hard way</title>
      <link>https://honza.pokorny.ca/2023/04/read-it-later-the-hard-way/</link>
      <description>There is a seemingly endless stream of articles we come across daily, and little time to read them. A quick glance at Hacker News in between tasks can yield half a dozen open tabs with articles to read at some point later. There are many services that help with this problem by maintaining a queue of these articles for you. You know the type: things like Instapaper or Pocket.
In this article, we will build a service like that.</description>

      <title>Boy Scouts’s bumbling CEOs cause inertia, leadership vacuum</title>
      <link>https://scoutingmaverick.com/2023/05/04/boy-scoutss-bumbling-ceos-cause-inertia-leadership-vacuum/</link>
      <description>Summary Thanks to a defective career-advancement system and a promote-from-within culture, BSA&amp;#39;s CEO role is a reward for over-promoted, career-lifer, caretaker-style middle-managers. This starves BSA of leadership talent where it is most needed. The resulting leadership vacuum enables BSA&amp;#39;s rudder to be controlled by two hands: the hand of inertia and the hand of throw-back...</description>

      <title>Stop working for outsourcing companies as a software engineer</title>
      <link>https://olzhasar.github.io/posts/stop-working-for-outsourcing-companies/</link>
      <description>I’ve spent about three years in total working at two different outsourcing companies throughout my career. At my last such job, I led the back-end development of four different projects, made a decent amount of money and met lots of cool people. That’s pretty much it regarding the advantages. There are a lot more disadvantages than one can even imagine. I’ll try to break down the most critical.
Context switching They always tell that you are going to work on a single project at a time.</description>

      <title>Advent of Code vs LeetCode</title>
      <link>https://olzhasar.github.io/posts/advent-of-code-vs-leetcode/</link>
      <description>I recently discovered the Advent of Code project for myself and I absolutely loved it. At first, it seemed similar to solving Leetcode problems. However, after trying it for a few days now I realized that I like the experience much more. In this short blog post I’ll try to break down main advantages that I see over Leetcode:
No online editor You don’t have to use the poor built-in online editor.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tenant Applications With EF Core</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/multi-tenant-applications-with-ef-core</link>
      <description> Most software applications today are built around the concept of multi-tenancy.
One application serves multiple customers, while keeping their data isolated.
You can approach multi-tenancy in two ways: - Single database &amp;amp; logical isolation of tenants - Multiple databases &amp;amp; physical isolation of tenants
Which option you decide to use will depend mostly on your requirements. Some industries like healthcare require a high degree of data isolation, and using a database per tenant is a must.
So how are we going to implement multi-tenancy support with EF Core?
We can use Query Filters to apply a tenant filter to all database queries.
Implement it once, and you can almost forget about it.</description>
