      <link>https://ourworldindata.org/mammals</link>
      <description>Travel back 100,000 years and the planet was rich with a wide array of wild mammals. Mammoths roamed across North America; lions across Europe; 200-kilogram wombats in Australasia; and the ground sloth lounged around South America.</description>

      <description>Wild mammal biomass has declined by 85% since the rise of humans. But we can turn things around by reducing the amount of land we use for agriculture.</description>

      <title>#lang lua</title>
      <link>https://defn.io/2022/11/12/ann-racket-lua/</link>
      <description>I’m currently working on a macOS app that’s built with Racket and allows the user to write small scripts to process and filter some data. While Racket is definitely my preferred language and I could easily use it for these scripts, my target audience for this app would probably appreciate a more familiar language. I decided to use Lua. So, last weekend I was faced with a choice1 between writing FFI bindings for Lua or implementing a #lang in Racket.</description>

      <title>Why Substack will win over everybody</title>
      <link>https://aneesh18.in/substack</link>
      <description>Blogs have been the avenues that amateurs flock to when they crave lighter opinions. There are no serious incentives for bloggers to write a 3000-word post that is deeply researched. Even though the masses don’t yearn for these deep posts, humanity as a whole needs them. These are the posts that document human civilization’s behaviour as a whole or write well balanced opinionated posts. And to write these posts is no mean feat. You can only find these breeds in New York Times, New Yorker or Washington Post and they attracted all these talents by providing a platform(already established audience) and lucrative career options. But the underlying thing of these entities is that they had a distribution moat. Not anymore.</description>

      <title>Tracing HTTP Requests with tcpflow &amp;#183; Anantha Kumaran</title>
      <link>https://ananthakumaran.in/2022/11/12/trace-http-requests.html</link>
      <description>PagerDuty went off very early in the morning, and our hero cursed his
bad luck and received the phone call. He made PagerDuty repeat the
message twice, but couldn’t understand the message. He pressed the
number to acknowledge the incident. He opened the MacBook and found
the slack message from the PagerDuty bot more informative. He clicked
the link and it took him to a Grafana Dashboard.</description>

      <title>The intuition behind the sum-check protocol in 5 minutes</title>
      <link>https://cryptologie.net/article/577/the-intuition-behind-the-sum-check-protocol-in-5-minutes/</link>
      <description>The sum check protocol allows a prover to convince a verifier that the sum of a multivariate polynomial is equal to some known value. It’s an interactive protocol used in a lot of zero-knowledge protocols. I assume that you know the Schwartz Zippel lemma in this video, and only give you intuitions about how the protocol works.

      <title>Crate List - Blessed.rs</title>
      <link>https://blessed.rs/crates</link>
      <description>Compared to other programming languages such as Python and Go, Rust&amp;#39;s standard library is very small, including only core data structures in the standard library with all other functionality farmed out to 3rd party ecosystem crates, and a common complaint from new Rust developers is that they don&amp;#39;t know where to start: which crates they ought to use and which crates they ought to trust. This list attempts to answer those questions.</description>
