      <title>Notes on COM aggregation: How do you implement tear-offs in an aggregated object? - The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220211-00/?p=106246</link>
      <description>Last time, we looked at how an inner or outer object participating in COM aggregation can obtain an interface from its partner without creating a circular reference. We also concluded with a realization that tear-offs create a particular problem with the technique we developed.</description>

      <title>Extract of Richard P. Feynman&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Los Alamos from below&amp;quot;</title>
      <link>https://cs.au.dk/~danvy/lafb.html</link>
      <description>One of the first interesting experiences I had in this project at
  Princeton was meeting great men.  I had never met very many great men
  before.  But there was an evaluation committee that had to try  to help
  us along, and help us ultimately decide which way we were going to
  separate the uranium.  This committee had men like Compton and Tolman
  and Smyth and Urey and Rabi and Oppenheimer on it.  I would sit in
  because I understood the theory of how our process of separating
  isotopes worked, so they&amp;#39;d ask me questions and talk about it.  In
  these discussions, one man would make a point.  Then Compton, for
  example, would explain a different point of view.  He would say it
  should be this way, and he was perfectly right.  Another guy
  would say, well, maybe, but there is this other possibility that we
  have to consider against it.</description>

      <title>Design Enterprise Integration Solutions using Azure single-tenant Logic Apps</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetcurry.com/microsoft-azure/single-tenant-logic-apps</link>
      <description>This article is a deep dive into how we can design and build integration Platform-as-a-Service (iPaaS) solutions using the 2021 flavor of logic apps that run in single-tenant mode. Infused with real-life project experience, the article will briefly go over the key differentiators of single-tenant over consumption-based logic apps, and then dive into the best practices, tooling, and the gotchas of building integration solutions in Azure with logic apps at the core.</description>
