      <title>Learning and documenting .NET with dotnet try – Bruno Sonnino</title>
      <link>https://blogs.msmvps.com/bsonnino/2020/03/22/learning-and-documenting-net-with-dotnet-try/</link>
      <description>Learning a new programming language is always hard. You have to read the documentation, stop, go to the IDE of your choice, start a new project, compile and run the program and see the results. Stop. Restart. After some time, you have no more patience for the process and start to skip some steps (maybe I don’t need to run this sample here…) until the point that you try to find an easier way, but most of the time there is no easier way.</description>

      <title>Raytracing - in Excel!!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28jJ7CMp8A</link>
      <description>All done in Excel, using only formulae with the only use of macros made for the inputting of key commands (e.g. wasd etc) and to run the animated camera.

The video is sped up somewhat over what is achievable in the model (in particular, the final segment is obviously sped up by a lot). Don't forget, this is Excel! However, on my fairly old PC it updates once every 2 seconds, so isn't too bad considering!

The model can be found here: https://github.com/s0lly/Raytracer-In-Excel

Hope you enjoy!

Acknowledgements:

This model was inspired by "The Ray Tracer Challenge" book by Jamis Buck - a brilliant read! Not all the features of that book are included, of course - Excel can only handle so much!!

Music by Eric Skiff, song "All of Us" for the intro and "09 Come and Find Me - B mix" for the main sequence. (Available at http://EricSkiff.com/music)</description>
