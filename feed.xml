      <title>Oren Eini on RavenDB, including Consistency Guarantees and C# as the Implementation Language </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/ravendb-csharp-implementation-language/</link>
      <description>Wesley Reisz talks to Oren Eini about the history of RavenDB. RavenDB is a fully transactional NoSQL Document database that implements both CP and AP guarantees at different times. The two discuss those CP/AP distributed systems challenges, the choice of implementation language (C#), and the current plans for RavenDB 6.0, which includes a server-side sharding implementation.</description>

      <title>Writing JIT Compiler on the Plane</title>
      <link>https://laplab.me/posts/writing-jit-compiler-on-the-plane/</link>
      <description>Feel free to join the discussion on HackerNews.
 Compilers always seemed a little bit like magic to me. You write the code in some language and then it spits out bitcode that a small crystall inside your computer understands.
Some databases ship with a specialized compiler inside them. This compiler can generate assembly code for parts of the query that are executed often. Such technique is called JIT compilation and can greatly reduce the interpretation overhead during query execution.</description>

      <title>What is bloat and why is it slowly killing most products</title>
      <link>https://kashishhora.com/what-is-bloat-and-why-is-it-slowly-killing-most-products/</link>
      <description>If you ask any long-time fan of a popular app or software product that’s been around for a while, they’ll have some gripes about how “it’s changed” and “it used to be better” and exhibit some nostalgic longing for the older, simpler times. It’s pretty much a universal trend.
But there seems to be some truth to this reaction. I’m sure you’ve noticed how certain apps on your phone, over time, have gotten so complicated and have so many features that you never use.</description>

      <title>How I think about C99 strict aliasing rules</title>
      <link>https://alanwu.space/post/strict-aliasing/</link>
      <description>Recently I was asked about how to review C99 code for problems that arise from failing to follow the so called “strict aliasing rules”. I struggled to present my thought process while vetting code for this class of problems, so I thought I would write a post to hopefully make my explanation more coherent.
The strict aliasing rules can be surprising because the way optimizers take advantage of them doesn’t mesh well with the popular belief that pointers are “just numbers”.</description>

      <title>Why developers should care about AVIF – The future of media</title>
      <link>https://www.devtopics.com/why-developers-should-care-about-avif-the-future-of-media/</link>
      <description>File compression is a key technology for digitization, as it can sustainably relieve the resources of network-based infrastructures. AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) is a modern image file format specification for storing images that offer a much more significant file reduction when compared to other formats like JPG, JPEG, PNG, and WebP. Compared to JPEG, AVIF compresses files more efficiently and provides higher image quality. Major global corporations in the digital industry are interested in the implementation of the new image format.</description>
