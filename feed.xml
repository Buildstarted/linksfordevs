      <title>Please Help, Apple Is Threatening To Terminate My Apple Developer Account With No Clear Reason.</title>
      <link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/please-help-apple-threatening-terminate-apple-developer-account/</link>
      <description>Hello guys.
I have been holding off to write this in case I was able to solve this problem on my own (which I tried to do very patiently), but the fact that I cannot talk to a human at Apple has prompted me to write this. Today I received another generic response from them (probably from a bot), so I’m prompted to write this to try to reach out to someone who can help.</description>

      <title>Sleep Hygiene For Software Engineers</title>
      <link>https://sklum.github.io/2020/06/14/sleep-hygiene-for-software-engineers.html</link>
      <description>Software engineers know the importance of sleep; posts extolling its virtues (or the problems associated with its absence) regularly reach the front page of HackerNews. In fact, around the time I finished this post there were two articles on the front page: Fitful nightly sleep linked to chronic inflammation, hardened arteries and Why Sleep Deprivation Kills. Yikes! There’s invariably a comment on sleep-related posts saying something to the effect of, “I know getting good sleep is important, but I don’t know why I’m not sleeping well and I don’t know how to resolve it even if I did!”. Academia offers little help as there’s only a handful of studies focusing on sleep solely for the software engineer.</description>

      <title>The Web Has Got Me</title>
      <link>https://mattharwood.com/the-web-has-got-me</link>
      <description>Last week, I decided to start tackling a problem I've had for a long, long time. Brain fog. It's been getting worse over the years - to the point that I don't realise time has gone by. I forget things instantly. A tipping point was recently being unable to work out a profit margin (rather embarrassing for all concerned!).</description>

      <title>Simplify DisplayName Calls In Razor Views</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/simplify-displayname-calls-in-razor</link>
      <description>Razor is a sharp user interface language, but it can also cut into our sensibilities and aesthetic code choices. ASP.NET ships with many HTML helpers to help reduce the amount of code we write to ship user interfaces, and for the most part, they work pretty well. With the latest version of ASP.NET, there are techniques we can use to reduce the noise in our views.</description>

      <description>In Part 2, we used Visual Studio's Publish feature to deploy our NServiceBus endpoint to an Azure App Service, and after only one manual change in the Azure Portal, saw our endpoint successfully running by viewing the app service logs. In this post, we'll be pulling back the curtain on Visual Studio Publish to examine what's happening in your local solution and in Azure.</description>
