      <link>https://thesloth.me/posts/3/</link>
      <description>In my first post mentioned that i have ideas for improvements of my blog infrastructure. I figured it’s time to introduce them. This will be a write-up of how i automated the process of updating this blog by hosting it as an image in docker hub and using Jenkins CI/CD tool.
Setting up jenkins container and nodes First things first, we need jenkins instance running somewhere. I chose to run it on my server in a docker container.</description>

      <title>Avg, mean, and average - Pravesh Koirala</title>
      <link>https://praveshkoirala.com/2023/02/19/avg-mean-and-average/</link>
      <description>One of the annoying things about learning a new programming language / library is to remember all the small nuances that come with it. For example, why should it be that in some places you have to use avg() to calculate the average of a list of data points whereas other demand you use mean()</description>

      <description>That’s fake exasperation. Yes, they do! I’m just not terribly surprised. If someone were to put me in charge of MDN and finding a business model, I would have used advertising as part of it long ago. I think it can be done tastefully, non-invasively, and possibly even usefully. So far, it looks like they […]</description>

      <title>ChatGPT Is Not a Blurry JPEG of the Web. It&amp;#39;s a Simulacrum.</title>

      <description>The gifted sci-fi writer Ted Chiang recently wrote a New Yorker article, “ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web”, with the thesis that large language models like ChatGPT can be analogized to lossy compression algorithms for their input data.</description>

      <title>Haskell: Day 1/∞</title>
      <link>https://andrew-quinn.me/haskell-day-1/</link>
      <description>I want to become a Haskell developer.
Last year, during my unemployment, I cracked open Haskell Programming from First Principles and read through all 1200 plus pages. I did every exercise, made Anki flashcards of every quirk of the language. And after about 2 and a half months of going at it - I claimed victory.
Then I stowed it away. Because I was a new engineer in an unknown country and my financial situation was getting increasingly dire and I knew I had to find a job as soon as that passport came through from Ireland - fast.</description>

      <description>Did you see the following error in recent days in your build-pipeline:
error NETSDK1194: The &amp;quot;--output&amp;quot; option isn&amp;#39;t supported when building a solution.
If so - that is not necessarily your fault at all! Microsoft released a new SDK version, which breaks your builds. Let&amp;#39;s see why and what we can do to tackle that.
