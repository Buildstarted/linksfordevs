      <description>I have always dabbled with programming languages, even as a kid. But I never made anything with them until I was in my 20s. Most extensive things I did before my 20s was simple modifications to some files or dumb tiny javascript files.</description>

      <title>We keep the product manager upright — johnpublic</title>
      <link>https://johnpublic.mataroa.blog/blog/what-is-product-data-science/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been working in the role &amp;quot;product data scientist&amp;quot; (DS) for quite a few years now. It doesn&amp;#39;t have quite the same clarity as some of the other roles in tech: Engineers build the product. Designers tell the engineers what the product should be. User researchers tell the designers what the users need. And the product manager tells them all to hurry up. So, what does a DS do?</description>

      <title>Learning JAX by Learning to Learn</title>
      <link>https://teddykoker.com/2022/04/learning-to-learn-jax/</link>
      <description>Gradient-descent-based optimizers have long been used as the optimization algorithm of choice for deep learning models. Over the years, various modifications to the basic mini-batch gradient descent have been proposed, such as adding momentum or Nesterov’s Accelerated Gradient (Sutskever et al., 2013), as well as the popular Adam optimizer (Kingma &amp;amp; Ba, 2014). The paper Learning to Learn by Gradient Descent by Gradient Descent (Andrychowicz et al., 2016) demonstrates how the optimizer itself can be replaced with a simple neural network, which can be trained end-to-end. In this post, we will see how JAX, a relatively new Python library for numerical computing, can be used to implement a version of the optimizer introduced in the paper.</description>

      <description>You need to accept one truth – every shop is messy and every app has its skeletons. Period.&amp;#128128; &amp;#129412; You don’t think that Google, Apple, Meta, or others have some skeletons in their development closets? They do. Every project starts with rainbows and sunshine and ends up being held up by sticks and glue – […]</description>

      <title>Founding Uber SRE.</title>
      <link>https://lethain.com/founding-uber-sre/</link>
      <description>This is my personal story of starting the SRE organization at Uber. If you want advice rather than reminiscence, take a look at Trunk and Branches Model and Productivity in the age of hypergrowth.
After I left SocialCode in 2014, I spent a month interviewing at a handful of companies trying to figure out what to do next. I was torn between considering two different paths: (1) leading engineering at a very small startup, or (2) taking a much smaller role at a fast growing company, with the expectation that growth would create opportunity.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: Build gRPC &amp;amp; OData in ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/odata/tutorial-build-grpc-odata-in-asp-net-core/</link>
      <description>Introduction gRPC (google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance remote procedure call framework that helps developers to build and consume remote services using the same way as calling local APIs. Different from gRPC, OData (Open Data Protocol) is an&amp;#160;OASIS standard&amp;#160;that defines a set of best practices for developers to build and consume RESTful APIs using HTTP request/response.</description>

      <title>A File Format to Aid in Security Vulnerability Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116</link>
      <description>When security vulnerabilities are discovered by
researchers, proper reporting channels are often lacking. As a result,
vulnerabilities may be left unreported. This document defines a machine-parsable format
(&amp;quot;security.txt&amp;quot;) to help organizations describe their vulnerability disclosure practices
to make it easier for researchers to report vulnerabilities.</description>
