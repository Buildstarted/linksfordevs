      <title>Playing with Nom and parser combinators</title>
      <link>https://andreabergia.com/blog/2024/01/playing-with-nom-and-parser-combinators/</link>
      <description>I usually write parsers by starting from a grammar and either coding a lexer/parser by hand or relying on tools such as the fantastic Antlr. However, a friend recently introduced me to parser combinators, which I found to be very interesting and useful. It’s not a recent idea, but it was new to me, and I have found it to be very interesting and useful.
I have played a bit with a great Rust library called nom, and I had a lot of fun with it.</description>

      <description>Although this article isn’t related to any of the 12 Challenges so far, it’s on a subject I’m developing for a potential future challenge. In July 2021 Facebook sent me a cease-and-desist letter because I made a browser extension, Unfollow Everything, which helped people use Facebook less.</description>

      <title>Colin Woodbury - A Tour of the Lisps</title>
      <link>https://www.fosskers.ca/en/blog/rounds-of-lisp</link>
      <description>2023 seems to have been the year where I &amp;quot;made the rounds&amp;quot; of a number of major Lisps. There were several elements that lead to this. Firstly must have been my exposure to Elixir in 2022, which introduced me to the idea of debugging live systems and &amp;quot;staying in your program&amp;quot;. Secondly must have been my chief complaint of Rust; although it is a wonderful language and ecosystem in many ways, you can&amp;#39;t say that it&amp;#39;s beautiful, which my previous love Haskell very much was. Thirdly then must been the talk Stop Writing Dead Programs by Jack Rusher, which opened my eyes to the prevalence of the write-compile-run development cycle and how we can escape from it. And last was my day-to-day usage of Emacs, whose configuration language is also a Lisp. Thanks Henrik.</description>

      <title>HTTP at Thirty-Three</title>
      <link>https://www.simplethread.com/http-at-thirty-three/</link>
      <description>Explore the enduring significance of HTTP in its 33rd year with Homer Painter&amp;#39;s insightful blog &amp;#39;HTTP at Thirty-Three&amp;#39;. Published on January 26, 2024, this piece delves into the foundational role of HTTP 1.1 in the web&amp;#39;s evolution and its continued relevance in today&amp;#39;s rapidly changing technology landscape. Painter examines the protocol&amp;#39;s simplistic yet powerful nature, notably its stateless request/response framework, and how this has enabled a flexible and integrated web ecosystem. The blog also addresses the challenges and adaptations needed for modern applications, discussing alternative protocols like WebSockets and HTTP/3, yet emphasizing HTTP 1.1&amp;#39;s capabilities in providing fluid user experiences. With practical examples, like a collaborative document editing app, Painter showcases HTTP&amp;#39;s adaptability in meeting complex requirements of dynamic user interactions. This reflective piece is a must-read for anyone interested in the web&amp;#39;s past, present, and future, emphasizing the protocol&amp;#39;s versatility and importance in shaping the internet as we know it.</description>

      <title>Azure DevOps Podcast: Andrew Lock: Containers in .NET 8 - Episode 281</title>
      <link>http://azuredevopspodcast.clear-measure.com/andrew-lock-containers-in-net-8-episode-281</link>
      <description>Andrew Lock is a senior software engineer at Datadog, working out of Devon, in the UK. He is a Microsoft MVP, Author of  Core in Action, and has an active blog all about his experience working with .NET and  Core. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [3:08] What is Andrew working on these days? [3:42] The push towards open telemetry in .NET and the ecosystem in general. [4:49] In Andrew’s opinion, open telemetry is ready for use, but there is still much to learn. [6:58] The state of containers for .NET developers. [9:48] The use of chiseled containers. [15:46] Using chiseled containers for that extra level of security. [17:01] The different levels of chiseling. [19:04] What does it mean to be a self-contained ASP.NET application? [23:52] Other big container changes, including running as a non-root user and the default port inside the Docker container changing. [28:18] Port 8080 and the user App. [30:12] Windows containers for testing. [33:14] The repeatability of Dockers containers.   Mentioned in this Episode:     — New Video Podcast! Email us at .

      <title>The art of good code review</title>
      <link>https://philbooth.me/blog/the-art-of-good-code-review</link>
      <description>This post is an extension
to a talk I gave recently at work.
It was arranged at short notice
and the audience were experienced engineers,
so I kept it brief and tried not to be patronising.
But the feedback afterwards was quite positive
and there were some questions too,
so here&amp;#39;s the extended version
for anyone interested.
Note that our team conducts pre-merge reviews,
and some of the suggestions are specific to that context.
I actually prefer post-merge reviews,
but am yet to persuade everyone I work with
that they&amp;#39;re better.
Oh, and trigger warning:
this post contains opinions.</description>

      <title>MPAs vs SPAs: The False Dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://thomascothran.tech/2024/01/the-false-dichotomy-mpas-spas/</link>
      <description>This is the second post in the series “Have Clojure UIs Taken the Wrong Path?”. The first post is here.
How do we choose between building an application using a hypermedia approach versus the client-side SPA? This post won’t answer that question. But it will say how not to make that choice.
A common heuristic is the spectrum that stretches between old fashioned “Multi Page Apps” (MPAs) for basic use cases, to Single Page Applications for rich client interactivity.</description>

      <title>Aiming High, my path towards principal engineer</title>
      <link>https://www.adama-platform.com/2024/01/28/euler.html</link>
      <description>I’m probably going to transition this blog into a personal blog and rethink the content strategy for this platform some day. However, I’m helping a handful of people grow as engineers with a few of my clients, and my #1 goal in life is helping other engineers grow into their best self.

      <title>41 Years in UX: A Career Retrospective</title>
      <link>https://www.uxtigers.com/post/41-years-in-ux</link>
      <description>Summary:&amp;#160;Jakob Nielsen has worked in user experience since 1983. Much has changed, including his own journey from academia to practice, but the mission remains the same: to make computers suitable and pleasant for humans. I started working in user experience in 1983 — 41 years ago at the time of this writing. People often ask me why and how I got into usability. For the full story, we have to go back much further.

      <description>Here&amp;#39;s why “What do you do?” is a terrible question, and why you should stop asking it. I was that person. I used to ask this question, a lot. It was part of my normal small talk, as it is for many people across North America.</description>
