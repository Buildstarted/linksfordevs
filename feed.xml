      <title>Read Slowly</title>
      <link>https://sand256.xyz/posts/read-slowly/</link>
      <description>Have you ever set a goal for how many books you want to read in a year? If so, you’re not alone. Many people set that goal and some even compete with each other to see who can read the most books. To achieve the goal or win the competition, a lot of people would read as fast as they can.</description>

      <link>https://blog.victoriaslocum.com/post/TIL-2023-08-05</link>
      <description>We seem to have this fascination with combining machines, our mechanical and arguably innately unhumanlike inventions, with our own sense of humanness, and visa versa - creating machines that act, think, and interact like us. Why? Is it the human need to develop something that they deem greater than themselves, or the human desire to make their own lives easier, or the human need for infallible companionship that it seems AI could provide? Maybe it’s simply the continuation of ideas that have slowly developed for centuries, or the individual fascination like my own? We can only guess until the future becomes the present and we see exactly how the rise of AI has changed the world.</description>

      <title>Should we stop writing functions?</title>
      <link>https://www.foonathan.net/2023/08/stop-writing-functions/</link>
      <description>… and use lambdas instead?
That is, instead of:
int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
You’d write:
constexpr auto sum = [](int a, int b) -&amp;gt; int {
    return a + b;
};
Hear me out.</description>

      <title>Injust games - God and Legions</title>
      <link>https://godsandlegions.com/2023/08/06/injust-games/</link>
      <description>While working on Gods and Legions I thought about “what is I do not like Gods and legions to have?”. Obviously, the bad things are infinite, but some bad characteristics are already named and are “easy” to not do. I love old games. Yesterday I was playing Double Dragon (arcade version), and in the bridge part, something was wrong.. As the video shows, a little touch down in the joystick and Jimmy Lee falls into the water. Before the bridge draw ends! It occurs on the last board of the bridge too. Injust Games Arcade games are very hard because…</description>

      <title>Why the words in “CAP theorem” are so confusing! – LINISNIL</title>
      <link>https://linisnil.com/posts/2023/why-the-words-in-cap-theorem-are-so-confusing/</link>
      <description>The word “consistency” is extremely overloaded in the realm of distributed systems. In CAP, consistency means that every read reflects the most recent write. This is also known as single-copy consistency or strict / strong consistency. Data is replicated to multiple nodes in these systems, but any reads to this storage system should give the illusion that read and writes are going to the same node. Put another way – there’s multiple copies of data in practice, but readers always see the latest (single) copy.</description>

      <title>Hedonism, Asceticism and the Hermetic Answer</title>
      <link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/hedonism-asceticism-and-the-hermetic-answer/</link>
      <description>The modern world more or less gives you the philosophical choice of either Hedonism or Asceticism. You never really hear it in those terms, but that&amp;#39;s how it is.
Hedonism living for pleasure. Your default lifestyle is eating whatever, watching Netflix and playing video games irrespective of how late it is. You watch porn, masturbate, have sex as much as you can and any consequences of any of this are just facts of life which you view as either out of your control or worth the suffering.</description>
