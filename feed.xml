      <title>Save Files With Elevated Permissions on UnauthorizedAccessException</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2023/Nov/03/Save-Files-With-Elevated-Permissions-on-UnauthorizedAccessException</link>
      <description>If you have an application that generically allows you to edit and save files, you might on rare occasions need to save files in locations that where a regular user account does not have permissions to save. Rather than failing wouldn&amp;#39;t it be nice to let the user know and optionally allow saving with elevated permissions? In this post I describe the workflow and implementation on how to do just that.</description>

      <title>Othello is Solved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19387</link>
      <description>The game of Othello is one of the world&amp;#39;s most complex and popular games that
has yet to be computationally solved. Othello has roughly ten octodecillion (10
to the 58th power) possible game records and ten octillion (10 to the 28th
power) possible game position. The challenge of solving Othello, determining
the outcome of a game with no mistake made by either player, has long been a
grand challenge in computer science. This paper announces a significant
milestone: Othello is now solved, computationally proved that perfect play by
both players lead to a draw. Strong Othello software has long been built using
heuristically designed search techniques. Solving a game provides the solution
which enables software to play the game perfectly.</description>

      <title>Issues enabling BitLocker hardware encryption (Windows Encrypted Hard Drive) on AMD 7840</title>
      <link>https://community.frame.work/t/issues-enabling-bitlocker-hardware-encryption-windows-encrypted-hard-drive-on-amd-7840/39415</link>
      <description>Just got my Framework 13 AMD 7040 (7840U, 64GB) and am trying to set it up with a Samsung 990 Pro 2TB SSD with Windows 11 using BitLocker hardware encryption (Windows Encrypted Hard Drive). I’m using this guide which I’ve successfully followed on my desktop rig using a Samsung 990 Pro 1TB. In my testing the hassle is totally worth it if you’re going to be using BitLocker (which is mandated in many corporate environments) as the default software-based encryption can dramatically impact disk perfo...</description>
