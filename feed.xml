      <title>Why does PF_VIRT_FIRMWARE_ENABLED return false even when virtualization is enabled in the firmware? | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201216-00/?p=104550</link>
      <description>The Is&amp;#173;Processor&amp;#173;Feature&amp;#173;Present function has a processor feature called PF_VIRT_FIRMWARE_ENABLED. A customer enabled virtualization in their firmware, but calling Is&amp;#173;Processor&amp;#173;Feature&amp;#173;Present with that feature still returned FALSE. Why is this function lying? It’s not lying. Even if you enable virtualization in firmware, it may not actually be available.</description>

      <title>To the brain, reading computer code is not the same as reading language</title>
      <link>https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215</link>
      <description>MIT neuroscientists have found reading computer code does not rely on the regions of the brain involved in language processing. Instead, it activates the “multiple demand network,” which is also recruited for complex cognitive tasks such as solving math problems or crossword puzzles.</description>

      <description>Bad air is bad for you. The air purifier market, though, is a mess. Every purifier uses incompatible proprietary filters, presumably to lock you into buying replacements forever. How do we know these actually work? Few seem to publish lab tests. And why does it cost $100-$300 for a big plastic box with a fan and a filter inside?</description>

      <title>How Tail Call Optimization Works</title>
      <link>https://eklitzke.org/how-tail-call-optimization-works</link>
      <description>Most undergraduate computer sciences courses teach students about tail call
optimization (TCO), and even if you
don&amp;#39;t have a formal computer science background the concept is talked about
enough that you might be familiar with it anyway, especially if you&amp;#39;ve ever done
any functional programming. However, I think the way TCO is normally taught is
very confusing, because it&amp;#39;s normally taught in the context of recursion. It&amp;#39;s
taught this way because without TCO many recursive functions can blow up the
stack causing a stack overflow. Therefore by teaching people about TCO in the
context of recursion, you can teach them why optimizing compilers (or
interpreters) can run tail recursive code efficiently and without causing a
stack overflow.</description>

      <description>Picture yourself, an engineer working at the hottest distributed microservices de jour, assigned to fix a bug. You jump into an unfamiliar codebase and quickly locate the line where the problem occurred. The fix is simple, just return early or substitute a default value in the case that one cannot be determined from your input. Boom, problem solved. Code compiles, fix goes out to production, and the card’s in the done pile in time for Tuesday drinks at the pub.</description>

You might need to check or adjust a configuration file, […]</description>

 Short trailer Walkthrough and technical details  I’m pleased to finally have some results to show for a project I’ve been working on in my spare time for the last year or so.
The idea originated when I was trying to think of an interesting idea for a project to help me learn Verilog and FPGA design, and the notion of building a simple raytracer came to mind (partly inspired by a scarily smart friend of mine who is building his own GPU).</description>

      <title>Shitlist Driven Development</title>
      <link>https://sirupsen.com/shitlists/</link>
      <description>Recently the team I work with completed a project to allow Shopify to run in
multiple datacenters. This project
was a refactoring project in disguise. When you undertake large refactoring of a
code-base with 100s of developers and 100,000s of lines of code, you can’t align
by sending an email. The merge-conflicts a single pull request would entail
makes me shiver. When deprecating in a large code-base the only way to reliably
avoid new deprecated behaviour is a failing test that tells you what to do.
Otherwise the pace that new deprecated code is introduced can easily outpace the
speed at which you can remove them, or be a massive source of frustration.</description>

      <title>There’s more to Power Platform than low-code/no-code development | Developer Support</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/theres-more-to-power-platform-than-low-code-no-code-development/</link>
      <description>Reed Robison reflects on Microsoft’s Power Platform and how low-code/no-code development is only one aspect of the value it provides to Office 365 customers. As a developer that has been around longer than I care to admit, I’ve seen a lot of low-code/no-code platform come and go.</description>
