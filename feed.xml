      <title>Inside the Microsoft STL: The std::exception_ptr | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200820-00/?p=104097</link>
      <description>When debugging, you may find yourself staring at a std::exception_ptr and want to know what exception is inside it. What you see in the MSVC header file is that a std::exception_ptr is a class that consists of two pointers enigmatically named _Data1 and _Data2.</description>

      <description>Last time, we saw how to dig the exception object out of a std::exception_ptr. But what kind of exception objects might there be? For C++/CX code, you are probably going to get a Platform::Exception^. 0:007&gt; ?? p class std::exception_ptr   +0x000 _Data1      : 0x08a5885c Void   +0x004 _Data2      : 0x08a58850 Void  We learned that the _Data1 points to an EXCEPTION_RECORD¹</description>

      <title>Introducing the new Azure SDKs</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38RYIx7a2M4</link>
      <description>Azure SDK Website: https://aka.ms/azsdk

Azure SDK Blog: https://aka.ms/azsdk/blog
Azure SDK Releases: https://aka.ms/azsdk/releases

Introducing the new Azure SDKs

Before we introduced the new Azure SDKs in July of 2019, each Azure Service team independently created their own SDKs in disparate repositories, had their own CI process, and had varying levels of authentication, language, OS, and package support.  

With the new Azure SDKs we have established a set of common design guidelines, a centralized engineering system, centralized open-source repositories, as well as consistent authentication, language, and OS support. We also deliver packages to the most popular package managers for each language.

We currently provide libraries in .NET, Java, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript with more languages coming soon. 

https://aka.ms/azsdk will lead you to the Azure SDK website, which a great landing spot with links to our packages, guidelines, documentation, and blog.

Developer productivity is the primary driver for the new Azure SDK effort.

We know that you will be most productive when your experience feels natural for whatever language you code in and when you can easily download the libraries from package managers that you use every day.

Consistency is also key, with the new Azure SDKs, navigating amongst the services doesn’t require you to learn a new API paradigm.  

Being approachable, diagnosable, and dependable are all pillars that go into building libraries, so we are investing heavily in these areas as well. Including ramping up our documentation efforts, integrating with standard logging frameworks, and holding API board reviews for all new libraries.

You can find all these guidelines detailed at https://aka.ms/azsdk/guide. We’ll continue to evolve these guidelines, so please review them, and provide us with feedback or suggestions via GitHub

We released our first GA libraries in the fall of 2019 and continue to release monthly.  

In GA, we currently have Storage, Key Vault, Event Hubs, App Config, Cosmos for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python and Java. Cognitive Services Text Analytics. Azure.Identity and Azure.Core which implement a consistent authentication and request/response pipeline for all libraries.


And in Preview, we have Cosmos for .NET. Cognitive Services Form Recognizer, Cognitive Search, Service Bus, and the Azure SDK for Embedded C

We’ll eventually GA libraries for all Azure services, but next up on the list is Tables, Cognitive services Anomaly Detector, Azure Synapse Analytics, and the new Resource Management libraries.

You can find the full list of libraries with links to packages, code, and docs at https://aka.ms/azsdk/releases. 

You can find the code for all the new Azure SDKs at https://aka.ms/azsdk/github. That will take you to our central repo which has links to all the other language specific repos and houses our common design guidelines. It’s a great place to file architecture board suggestions and questions or issues that cut across all the SDKs. The overriding theme here is everything in the open on GitHub, with an engaged engineering team to help you through any issues you discover as you build your Azure solutions.


We’d like to encourage you to start using the new Azure SDKs and contributing to them by submitting issues or pull-requests on GitHub. You can follow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/@AzureSDK and subscribe to our blog at https://aka.ms/azsdk/blog.</description>

      <description>This page discusses how I added a microSD card to my reMarkable tablet. I did this because I want to develop software for my rM without wearing out the internal eMMC. I chose an external card because I want to be able to swap them easily; it also makes backups faster.</description>
