      <title>Alexandre N&amp;#233;d&amp;#233;lec - What can we do when stuck with a programming problem?</title>
      <link>https://www.techwatching.dev/posts/get-unstuck</link>
      <description>Like I wrote in my last article, as a developer sometimes you get stuck on a problem for a few hours or a few days, your code won&amp;#39;t work, and you think nobody can help you &amp;#128575;. This can be very frustrating, but fortunately, there are plenty of ways to look for a solution or to seek help. You are probably already using some of them with success, yet there may be some you don&amp;#39;t think of and that could help you a lot. That is the topic of this article.</description>
