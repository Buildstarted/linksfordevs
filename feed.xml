      <title>Jekyll Two Ways on Windows: Installing &amp; building Jekyll / GitHub Pages blogs with Ruby on Windows 10</title>
      <link>https://seankilleen.com/2020/03/installing-building-jekyll-github-pages-blogs-with-ruby-on-windows/</link>
      <description>I wanted to write up these steps as I took the time to get my blog up and running on my new laptop, in case it helps someone else get started.  Today, we’ll explore two ways of doing this – the Windows way for those of you who like working via Windows, and the WSL way. I like having both set up so that I can use whatever suits me.  The Windows Way  Before we Begin: Pitfalls we’ll be avoiding          FYI: Normally, I’d run choco install ruby -y, which would install ruby v2.7.0.1 at the time of this writing. However, that led to a pitfall later in the process where I’d see that nokogiri is not currently supported on Ruby 2.7, so I need to pin the 2.6.x package, which we’ll do during this tutorial for this reason.           Ruby DevKit used to be a thing for windows. Now ridk uses msys2, so we’ll be installing that during this step as well.      Step 1: Install the Packages          Open PowerShell as an admin (this is important for chocolately packages)      We’ll need msys, so I run choco install msys2 -y   I need to find the 2.6.x version of ruby that will work, so I go to the Chocolatey page for the Ruby package   I expand the “Version History” section and see the current 2.6 version is 2.6.5.1   So, I run choco install ruby --version=2.6.5.1 -y   I then pin the package so it won’t accidentally be upgraded later. To do this, I run choco pin add -n=ruby.   Step 2: Getting the Ruby DevKit installed     I close and re-open PowerShell as a non-admin (to let the paths update, and maybe because I’m just a little superstitious at this point).   I run ridk version to make sure that the prompt shows up and the version numbers look correct   I run ridk install. At the prompt, I hit enter to let it do its thing.   It installs. At the end, I see the phrase there is nothing to do so I hit enter at the prompt and allow it to exit.   I run ridk enable to enable it.   Step 3: Getting the Bundler Installer Configured     I re-open the PowerShell window (superstition, remember?)   I run bundler --version and see that it’s 1.17.x out of the box.   I run gem install bundler to upgrade it to version 2.x   Step 4: Installing the packages     I go to the source directory that has my Gemfile.   I delete the gemfile.lock file, as I’d like to ensure the packages are being recreated as bundler sees fit.   I run bundle install   I wait. For a while. Because I have native dependencies in some of these gems, some code literally needs to get compiled while I wait. I sip some coffee.   Step 5: Running the site     I run bundle exec jekyll serve to compile and serve the site   The WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) Way  These steps assume I’ll still be committing &amp; pushing code via my Windows install, so they leave out setting up git on Ubuntu. (Happy to discuss how to do that in the comments; just ping me if you get stuck.)     Enable WSL. If you haven’t already open PowerShell as an admin an run Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux. You’ll need to restart after.   Go to the windows store and install a Linux distro of choice. I chose Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.   Open your WSL instance once it’s installed and set a password when you’re prompted to do so. (Pssst – do you have the new Windows Terminal? You can open a prompt right from that. It’s nifty.)   Run sudo apt-get update to update your packages   Run sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential to install Ruby   Run sudo gem install bundler to install bundler   Head to your current source code’s directory (mine is in C:\SeanK\Repositories\seankilleen.github.io, so I used cd /mnt/c/Users/SeanK/Repositories/seankilleen.github.io   You’ll have to install some other dependencies (at least on Ubuntu) – sudo apt-get install --reinstall zlibc zlib1g zlib1g-dev   Run bundle install. You’ll be prompted for your password during. Allow it time to finish.   Run bundle exec jekyll serve.   And there you have it! Jekyll two ways on Windows. :)  Happy publishing! </description>

I didn’t think a Facebook post was appropriate for this as I really wanted to keep this around as a reminder for anyone who reads it and for myself. I’m not looking for a discussion on what you think is right or wrong, that’s for you to keep on your internet space.</description>

      <description>Yes. This is yet another post about GridViews. We love them. You love them. What’s not to like?
If you’re not familiar with Out-GridView, it can be used to interactively view objects as a table allowing sorting and filtering. Many PowerShell users like to use it within a pipeline for interactive selection of objects that get processed later in the pipeline.</description>

      <title>Stateful Programming Models in Serverless Functions | QCon San Francisco 2020</title>
      <link>https://qconsf.com/sf2019/presentation/serverless-advantages-patterns-and-challenges</link>
      <description>Most will agree that Serverless is the future of cloud computing. But when most people think of Serverless, they think of FaaS (Functions as a Service), and when they think of FaaS, they think of functions that are ephemeral, stateless, and short-lived. But does this always need to be the case? Is it possible write functions that are stateful and long-running on top of ephemeral, Serverless compute platforms? In this session, we'll explore two stateful programming models: workflows and actors. We'll discuss how they can simplify development and how they enable stateful and long-running application patterns within ephemeral, Serverless compute environments. We'll also explain why we're making a bit bet on these programming models in the Azure Functions service.</description>

      <title>Zip Files: History, Explanation and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://www.hanshq.net/zip.html</link>
      <description>I have been curious about data compression and the Zip file format in particular for a long time. At some point I decided to address that by learning how it works and writing my own Zip program. The implementation turned into an exciting programming exercise; there is great pleasure to be had from creating a well oiled machine that takes data apart, jumbles its bits into a more efficient representation, and puts it all back together again. Hopefully it is interesting to read about too.</description>

      <title>JavaScript Variables: var and let and const</title>
      <link>https://www.prestonlamb.com/blog/javascript-variables-var-and-let-and-const</link>
      <description>There are three ways to create variables in a JavaScript application: using var, using let, or using const. This will not be a post trying to convince you which one you should use, or arguing about what is best. It’s just good to know about the differences and what it means when you use the different options.</description>

      <title>As we work to protect public health, we also need to protect the income of hourly workers who support our campus - Microsoft on the Issues</title>
      <link>https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/03/05/covid-19-microsoft-hourly-workers/</link>
      <description>Microsoft has asked its employees who can work from home to do so due to the impact of COVID-19. Despite this meaning a reduced need for many of the hourly workers vital to our daily operations, we’ve decided that Microsoft will continue to pay their regular pay during this period. We hope other large companies will take a similar approach to counteract the economic effect COVID-19 will have on hourly workers.</description>

      <title>SLIDE : In Defense of Smart Algorithms over Hardware Acceleration for Large-Scale Deep Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03129</link>
      <description>Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are the central focus of modern machine
learning systems. As data volumes keep growing, it has become customary to
train large neural networks with hundreds of millions of parameters to maintain
enough capacity to memorize these volumes and obtain state-of-the-art accuracy.
To get around the costly computations associated with large models and data,
the community is increasingly investing in specialized hardware for model
training. However, specialized hardware is expensive and hard to generalize to
a multitude of tasks. The progress on the algorithmic front has failed to
demonstrate a direct advantage over powerful hardware such as NVIDIA-V100 GPUs.
This paper provides an exception. We propose SLIDE (Sub-LInear Deep learning
Engine) that uniquely blends smart randomized algorithms, with multi-core
parallelism and workload optimization. Using just a CPU, SLIDE drastically
reduces the computations during both training and inference outperforming an
optimized implementation of Tensorflow (TF) on the best available GPU. Our
evaluations on industry-scale recommendation datasets, with large fully
connected architectures, show that training with SLIDE on a 44 core CPU is more
than 3.5 times (1 hour vs. 3.5 hours) faster than the same network trained
using TF on Tesla V100 at any given accuracy level. On the same CPU hardware,
SLIDE is over 10x faster than TF. We provide codes and scripts for
reproducibility.</description>
