      <title>Running with VSTest | BenchmarkDotNet</title>
      <link>https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/features/vstest.html</link>
      <description>BenchmarkDotNet supports discovering and executing benchmarks through VSTest.
This provides an alternative user experience to running benchmarks with the CLI
and may be preferable for those who like their IDE&amp;#39;s VSTest integrations that they may have used when running unit tests.</description>

      <title>Phishing Your Team Isn&amp;#39;t The Answer • Nick Selby</title>
      <link>https://nickselby.com/docs/tricking/</link>
      <description>Successful phishing attacks - tricking your employees into clicking a link and then taking an action, such as providing information to a fake web page - is the primary vector for ransomware infections. But it’s really not that simple. Ransomware exploits weaknesses in training, but also in how you have architected and executed on your overall information technology and information security fabric. Even if you removed phishing completely (which is hard), ransomware would still present a threat.</description>

      <description>There are lots of new image compression formats out there. They excel at taking large, complex pictures and algorithmically reducing them to smaller file sizes. All of the comparisons I&amp;#39;ve seen show how good they are at squashing down big files. I wanted to go the other way. How good are modern codecs at dealing [...]</description>

      <title>in search of a new tab</title>
      <link>https://jon.bo/posts/new-tab/</link>
      <description>A few months ago my friend Eli was sharing his screen and opened a new tab on his browser. Instead of the usual inspirational quote or clock extension, commonly-visited tabs, or my personal pet peeve - recent breaking news articles and photos from disaster zones - his new tab was a map of his internet and most important documents:
 I was enthralled: it was the most useful thing I’ve ever seen on a new tab page, completely personalized to his needs and his perspective on the internet.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Advent of Code</title>
      <link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2024-01-05-aoc/</link>
      <description>2023 came with another edition of Advent of Code, an advent calendar with programming challenges.
In many ways - e.g. the assessment of both performance of and correctness on official leaderboards - the programming challenges are similar to regular programming competitions. Yet, there is also a large part of the community approaching Advent of Code more casually: people playing around with funky programming languages (e.g. Nix or Nim) or people streaming their daily programming sessions.</description>

      <title>PostgreSQL: Full text search with the “websearch” syntax - Adam Johnson</title>
      <link>https://adamj.eu/tech/2024/01/03/postgresql-full-text-search-websearch/</link>
      <description>PostgreSQL’s powerful full text search feature supports several query syntaxes. Of these, a website search feature should typically pick the websearch syntax. websearch copies some features from popular search engines, as covered below, offering familiar short syntax to users. It is also forgiving and will never raise a syntax error for user input, whilst other syntaxes can.</description>

      <title>Death Of A Programmer. Life Of A Farmer.</title>

      <description>Ready To Launch Your First (Or Next) Funnel...? If So, You Are In Luck Because The &amp;quot;One Funnel Away&amp;quot; Challenge Is BACK!!! Every person has their own idea of the things that keep them alive, and conversely, the things that slowly drain their lives away.
