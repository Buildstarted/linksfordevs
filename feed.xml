      <title>Analysing the (Alleged) Minneapolis Police Department "Hack"</title>
      <link>https://www.troyhunt.com/analysing-the-alleged-minneapolis-police-department-hack/</link>
      <description>The situation in Minneapolis at the moment (and many other places in the US) following George Floyd's death is, I think it's fair to say, extremely volatile. I wouldn't even know where to begin commentary on that, but what I do have a voice on is data breaches which prompted</description>

      <title>Measuring keyboard-to-photon latency with a light sensor</title>
      <link>https://thume.ca/2020/05/20/making-a-latency-tester/</link>
      <description>For a long time when I’ve wanted to test the latency of computers and UIs I’ve used the Is It Snappy app with my iPhone’s high speed camera to count frames between when I press a key and when the screen changes. However the problem with that is it takes a while to find the exact frames you want, which is annoying when doing a bunch of testing. It also makes it difficult to find out what the variability of latency is like. I had already made this kind of testing easier by adding a mode to my keyboard firmware which changes the LED color after it sends a USB event, but that only made it a bit faster and more precise. I wanted something better.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core WebSockets and Application Lifetime Shutdown Events</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/May/28/ASPNET-Core-WebSockets-and-Application-Lifetime-Shutdown-Events</link>
      <description>WebSockets in ASP.NET Core are easy to use but due to the simple model it's easy to forget that socket requests are long lived and can linger for a long time in the background and that can cause problems when an application needs to shut down cleanly. Luckily there's an `IHostApplicationLifetime` interface available that allows hooking shutdown operations and that provides the necessary cancellation tokens to allow an WebSocket connection to be terminated in response to a shutdown event. This post shows how this works.</description>

      <title>Immutable data structures in F#</title>
      <link>https://www.compositional-it.com/news-blog/immutable-data-structures-in-f/</link>
      <description>Immutable data structure are data structures, like lists, arrays, sets etc., which cannot be changed, meaning that the values inside them can't be added, removed, moved or swapped. Instead of changing the data structure you make a new version of the data structure which is a separate value. This approach works when using functional programming style. They can also be referred to as purely functional or persistent data structures.</description>
