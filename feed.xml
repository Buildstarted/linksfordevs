      <description>I was reticent to write this blog post because it leaves a lot of questions unanswered, questions that we should be able to answer. It's about a data breach with almost 90GB of personal information in it across tens of millions of records - including mine. Here's what I know:</description>

      <title>Up to 4GB of memory in WebAssembly ¬∑ V8</title>
      <link>https://v8.dev/blog/4gb-wasm-memory</link>
      <description>Thanks to recent work in Chrome and Emscripten, you can now use up to 4GB of memory in WebAssembly applications. That‚Äôs up from the previous limit of 2GB. It might seem odd that there was ever a limit - after all, no work was needed to allow people to use 512MB or 1GB of memory! - but it turns out that there are some special things happening in the jump from 2GB to 4GB, both in the browser and in the toolchain, which we‚Äôll describe in this post.</description>

      <title>A Quick Look at Impredicativity (Simon Peyton Jones)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuNMo136QqI</link>
      <description>Type inference for parametric polymorphism is wildly successful, but has always suffered from an embarrassing flaw: polymorphic types are themselves not first class. I‚Äôve been trying to fix this flaw for over 15 years , but every time I ended up with a system that was unusably complicated.

But now I think we have it! Quick Look is a practical, implemented, and deployable design for impredicative type inference. It is simple to explain (although you can be the judge of that), and crucially it can be implemented with modest, localised changes that are fully compatible with GHC‚Äôs myriad other type system extensions.

Bio: Simon Peyton Jones, FRS, graduated from Trinity College Cambridge in 1980. After two years in industry, he spent seven years as a lecturer at University College London, and nine years as a professor at Glasgow University, before moving to Microsoft Research (Cambridge) in 1998.

Simon‚Äôs main research interest is in functional programming languages, their implementation, and their application. He was a key contributor to the design of the now-standard functional language Haskell, and is the lead designer of the widely-used Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). He has written two textbooks about the implementation of functional languages. He is particularly motivated by direct application of principled theory to practical language design and implementation ‚Äî that is one reason he loves functional programming so much.

Simon is chair of Computing at School, the grass-roots organisation that was at the epicentre of the 2014 reform of the English computing curriculum.

audience: Anyone interested in statically-typed functional programming.

      <description>ASP.NET Core is pretty flexible, customizable and extendable. You are able to change almost everything. Even the logging. If you don't like the built-in logging, you are able to plug in your own logger or an existing logger like log4net, NLog, Elmah. In this post I'm going to show you how to add a custom logger.</description>
