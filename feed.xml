      <title>The case against local LLMs</title>
      <link>https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/the-case-against-local-llms/</link>
      <description>As a geek, I love the idea of running LLMs locally, and owning my entire AI stack without depending on cloud APIs. I run LLMs locally with Ollama all the time. I’d love to see a world where the intelligence that these models provide is democratized, cheap and plentiful.
But if I think about it objectively there are several reasons local LLMs going mainstream might not happen.
Widely used utilities want to be centralized
In the early days of electricity, factories generated their own electricity on-site. This phase was relatively short-lived, giving way to the centralized power grid we have now. The same thing happened with water, trash disposal, manufactured goods and pretty much every staple of modern life.</description>

      <title>"But LLMs are not deterministic!"</title>
      <link>https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/-but-llms-are-not-deterministic--/</link>
      <description>•	“But LLMs are not deterministic!”
The most common retort to my “LLMs are compilers” framing is:

“… but compilers are deterministic, LLMs just generate probabilistic output!”

I think that retort is not even wrong, and I’ll explain why.
The analogy’s central idea was not that LLMs replicate every characteristic of compilers, but that using natural-language-driven LLMs is another large step up in abstraction. Traditional compilers enabled programmers to express themselves in high-level languages instead of assembly. Similarly, LLMs empower programmers to express their intent directly in natural language, translating it into code.</description>
