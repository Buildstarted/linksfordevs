      <title>How to publish .NET 7 apps directly to Docker</title>
      <link>https://dateo-software.de/blog/publish-net-apps-to-docker</link>
      <description>With .NET 7 being around for only a couple of days now, there are plenty of new features to be played with.
One of these is the actual ability of .NET&amp;#39;s build infrastructure to directly publish your applications to a Docker container registry (or any other container registry, for that matter), without having to explicitly specify a Docker file.</description>

      <title>Lambda Cold Starts - .NET 7 Native AOT vs .NET 6 Managed Runtime | no dogma blog</title>
      <link>https://nodogmablog.bryanhogan.net/2022/11/lambda-cold-starts-net-7-native-aot-vs-net-6-managed-runtime/</link>
      <description>The release of .NET 7 brings with it a new way to compile and run .NET code - native AOT compilation. This post compares the cold start time of a Lambda function running on .NET 7 after native AOT compilation with the cold start time of a Lambda function running on .NET 6 with the managed runtime. The results are surprisingly good.</description>

      <title>ECMAScript proposal: source text access for `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`</title>
      <link>https://2ality.com/2022/11/json-parse-with-source.html</link>
      <description>In this blog post, we look at the ECMAScript proposal “JSON.parse source text access” by Richard Gibson and Mathias Bynens. It gives access to source text to two kinds of callbacks: Revivers, callbacks that are passed to JSON.parse() and post-process the data it parses. Replacers, callbacks that are passed to JSON.stringify() and pre-process data before it is stringified. We’ll examine how exactly that works and what you can do with this feature.</description>

      <title>A Life Engineered</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/@ALifeEngineered</link>
      <description>Software engineers can make code do just about anything. However, they often struggle with career direction, work-life balance and finding true meaning in their jobs.

Am I hitting a bit close to home? 

Let’s change that.

I have 16 years of experience at a high-performance, high-stress FAANG company as a principal engineer (top 1%). I’ve conducted over 850 technical interviews and am an expert on the promotion/growth track for high-level, non-managerial tech leadership.

It’s time to learn how to give your career and your life the same impact that your programs create for others. I’ll be there to guide you, prod you and maybe even push you out of your comfort zone. 

Ready to take a smart engineering approach to your career and life? 

Let’s do this.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</title>
      <link>https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/</link>
      <description>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any
subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)
as determined by the controller of the DID. In contrast to
typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may
be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate
authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the
discovery of information related to a DID, the design enables the
controller of a DID to prove control over it without requiring permission
from any other party. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID
subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions
associated with that subject.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, I wrote a blog post about how I set up the networking in our house following some major construction. I was really excited about how much better the internet would be. No more WiFi dead zones, and a wired connection to my computer to provide extra speed and stability to my office. Overall, the results were great. Speed test anywhere in my house showed I was getting the full 500mbps promised by my cable company. However, not everything was working as expected:</description>
