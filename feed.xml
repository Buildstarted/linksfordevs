      <description>Talk about social media, and someone will inevitably start explaining how it‚Äôs unhealthy. They‚Äôre not wrong. In fact, most of the ways people use ‚Äúthe computer‚Äù (phones, laptops, even game consoles included) are bad for people as a whole, even if they aren‚Äôt causing harm day-to-day. Why though?</description>

      <title>Billions of Edges Per Second with Postgres</title>
      <link>https://onesparse.com/blog/2025/07/01/billions-of-edges-per-second-with-postgres.html</link>
      <description>Chances are you're reading this because, like me, you are a huge
fan of Postgres.  It's a powerful and featured-filled data
framework, and is excellent for transactional workloads and
analysis tasks.  While I've always considered Postgres a pretty
decent tool for storing small graphs using foreign keys for edge
relationships, Postgres is not optmized for traversing billions of
edges for very large, sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>Defeating Memory Leaks With Zig Allocators</title>
      <link>https://tgmatos.github.io/defeating-memory-leaks-with-zig-allocators/</link>
      <description>I started reading the book Crafting Interpreters to learn about the process of developing and implementing a programming language (I have some criticism about the way the book presents formal concepts). The book is divided in two parts. The first one is an interpreter for the Lox programming language, which has a syntax similar to JavaScript and is implemented in Java. The second part is the virtual machine and it is written in C. Instead of using Java for the interpreter, I decided to use zig.</description>

      <title>The sound of inevitability</title>
      <link>https://tomrenner.com/posts/llm-inevitabilism/</link>
      <description>Have you ever argued with someone who is seriously good at debating? I have. It sucks.
You‚Äôre constantly thrown off-balance, responding to a point you didn‚Äôt expect to. You find yourself defending the weak edges of your argument, while the main thrust gets left behind in the back-and-forth, and you end up losing momentum, confidence, and ultimately, the argument.
One of my close friends won international debate competitions for fun while we were at university (he‚Äôs now a successful criminal barrister), and he told me that the only trick in the book, once you boil it all down, is to make sure the conversation is framed in your terms. Once that happens, it‚Äôs all over bar the shouting.</description>
