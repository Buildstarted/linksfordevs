      <title>Hacking a VoIP Phone</title>
      <link>https://stefan-gloor.ch/voip-phone-hack</link>
      <description>In this project, I analyzed and reverse engineered the firmware,
        file formats and custom cryptography of a business IP phone. As it
        turns out, many of the phone’s software components are customized,
        which made this a very interesting and insightful project. Finally, I
        wrote tools to craft my own update images, in order to install
        arbitrary software on the phone.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;To live is to be other. It&amp;#39;s not even possible to feel, if one feels today what he felt yesterday. To feel today what one felt yesterday is not to feel—it&amp;#39;s to remember today what was felt yesterday, to be today’s living corpse of what yesterday was lived and lost.&amp;quot; -- Fernando Pessoa</description>

      <title>Jepsen: jetcd 0.8.2</title>
      <link>https://jepsen.io/analyses/jetcd-0.8.2</link>
      <description>Jetcd is the official Java client library for the etcd coordination service. We show that jetcd contains an improper retry mechanism which allows transactions to execute multiple times, or to appear to fail but actually succeed. To users, these behaviors may appear as lost update, circular information flow, and aborted read. These issues have been outstanding for two and a half years. No patch is available, but disabling the retry mechanism is straightforward. This work was performed independently by Jepsen without compensation, and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy.</description>
