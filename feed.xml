      <title>I Guarantee You Haven&amp;#39;t Seen These Real Humanoid Robots | James Darpinian</title>
      <link>https://james.darpinian.com/blog/you-havent-seen-these-real-humanoid-robot-demos</link>
      <description>The world of humanoid robots is exploding, and new demos are coming out seemingly every day. I&amp;#39;m keeping a list updated with every current humanoid effort that has at least a public demo video. You&amp;#39;ll see dozens of projects at all scales, from one guy in his garage, to growing startups, to multinational conglomerates. Even if you follow the field pretty closely, I guarantee there will be at least one or two in this list you haven&amp;#39;t seen yet. And there&amp;#39;s even one you can buy right now! Scroll on to see them all, starting with some of the lesser known ones:</description>

      <title>Visualizing the ARM64 Instruction Set</title>
      <link>https://zyedidia.github.io/blog/posts/6-arm64/</link>
      <description>Lately I’ve been doing a lot of work with the ARM64 instruction set, and I
thought it would be fun to try to visualize it. ARM64 encodes every instruction
as a 32-bit integer, so one way to visualize the instruction set is by plotting
the instructions along a space-filling curve, such as a Hilbert curve1, and
coloring them according to their instruction class (i.e., general, advsimd,
float, sve, etc…).</description>

      <description>In 1990, the strategic PC operating system of Microsoft and IBM was not DOS, not Windows, but OS/2. The first 16-bit OS/2 was initially released in 1987 with a reduced feature set, but by the end of 1989, OS/2 1.2 completed two major features: The Presentation Manager GUI (first seen in OS/2 1.1) and installable file systems, notably the new HPFS file system.</description>

      <title>Running CP/M on the C128</title>
      <link>https://celso.io/posts/2024/03/03/c128-cpm/</link>
      <description>The CP/M, short for Control Program/Monitor, was one of the first operating systems of the personal computer revolution. It was launched in 1974, and it celebrates 50 years this year. It was ported and made available for many 8-bit machines with different CPUs and was related to running productivity software. If you ever used CP/M, then, well, I hate to say it, but you’re old.
I had a brief encounter with CP/M when I was 14 or 15 years old; I can’t remember exactly.</description>

All graphs made with graphviz (source)



Graphs are ubiquitous in software engineering:
 Package dependencies form directed graphs, as do module imports. The internet is a graph of links between webpages. Model checkers analyze software by exploring the “state space” of all possible configurations.</description>
