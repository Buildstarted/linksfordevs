      <title>Vibe coding is metaprogramming - foobuzz</title>
      <link>https://blog.valentin.sh/vibe-metacoding/</link>
      <description>I originally wanted to write 2 distinct articles, but realized that they shared the same underlying idea: "Vibe coding", the act of talking to an LLM / LLM-based AI agent to code a full project without writing a line of code manually, is no more than a metaprogramming technique, where a program (the AI agent), produces another program (the code that gets committed). As such, it shares some common characteristics of metaprogramming, notably: 1) The use-case of using metaprogramming when lacking an abstraction. 2) The poor experience of maintaining metaprogramming output when you can't maintain the generator level.</description>
