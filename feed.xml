      <title>Apple Needs a Snow Sequoia</title>
      <link>https://reviews.ofb.biz/safari/article/1300.html</link>
      <description>The same year Apple launched the iPhone, it unveiled a massive upgrade to Mac OS X known as Leopard, sporting “300 New Features.” Two years later, it did something almost unheard of: it released Snow Leopard, an upgrade all about how little it added and how much it took away. Apple needs to make it snow again.</description>

      <title>Laurent Kempé - Dockerizing your .NET C# MCP Server for AI Clients like Claude Desktop</title>
      <link>https://laurentkempe.com/2025/03/27/dockerizing-your-dotnet-csharp-mcp-server-for-ai-clients-like-claude-desktop/</link>
      <description>My previous post showed how easy it is to develop a .NET C# MCP server and write a client able to communicate with it. Now, the question is how we can distribute our MCP server to be used by AI clients. In this post, we’ll leverage the knowledge acquired from my previous posts to explore how to dockerize your .NET C# MCP server.</description>

      <title>Reverse Engineering GPT-4o's Image Gen Process</title>
      <link>https://www.philipnielsen.info/blog/blog_posts/4o-image.md</link>
      <description>OpenAI's 4o Image Generation capability launched two days ago on March 25th, 2025. The quality of the images it creates is the best among all contemporary models by a large margin. However, what is most interesting is the way it seems to generate the image: first it quickly creates a blurry version of the final image, then sharpens it from top to bottom, as if loading an image on a dial-up connection. This shouldn't be possible using a standard latent diffusion model, which would generate the whole image at once. What could they be doing different? As why is it better?</description>

      <description>When you're improvising a comedy scene, the golden rule is to respond with "yes, and" to everything your partners say and do. This unwavering acceptance can produce riotous bouts of laughter. In an engineering team, it just creates unholy messes.</description>

      <description>The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) is evolving rapidly, with powerful and open models being released at an unprecedented pace. As these technologies advance, so does the potential to integrate them into our existing systems. Traditionally, we've built systems with distinct layers such as the Application layer and Data Persistence layer.</description>

      <title>The Safari bug that punishes you for using content blockers | BenHollis.net</title>
      <link>https://benhollis.net/blog/2025/01/04/the-safari-bug-that-punishes-you-for-using-content-blockers/</link>
      <description>Running content blockers in your browser is a good idea–yes, you block ads, but you also block malware, cryptominers, tracking, and more. In general, the experience of using the web with a good content blocker should be noticeably faster, as you skip downloading and executing many megabytes of code, images, and videos that provides you with no benefit. I’ve run content blocking extensions since they were first introduced and I’ve never looked back.

Safari 15, released in September 2021, was the first version to support extensions, including content blocking extensions. This was a huge improvement to mobile browsing on iOS, which doesn’t offer any choice of browser besides Safari. Safari finally had a way to fight back against intrusive ads just like other browsers. I chose to use 1Blocker, which was highly reviewed by Apple aficionados at the time, though I’m sure there are other good alternatives.

      <link>https://www.scottsmitelli.com/articles/take-oncall-and-shove-it/</link>
      <description>At some companies, it is expected that certain engineers will serve as part of a formal on-call rotation. On paper, this seems like a reasonable way to ensure the reliability of the product. In practice, it is a miserable burden and you probably won't even get paid for it.</description>

      <title>Execution is everything... or nothing?</title>
      <link>https://nial.se/blog/execution-is-nothing/</link>
      <description>One striking feature of modern artificial intelligence, especially in large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, is their ability to instantly generate surprisingly advanced software engineering solutions. One interpretation of this phenomenon is that we are in the midst of a wave of commoditization. A specific subset of cognitive work, once scarce and expensive, has become infinitely accessible at minimal cost. With the rise of “vibe coding”, where AI tools are used transform a basic idea into a functional app or website almost instantly for fun, it seems that any basic concept for a digital product can now be cloned on the spot. The barrier to entry has dropped dramatically, while the bar for uniqueness has risen just as fast. Any simple enough product can be replicated instantly. Are we witnessing the rapid commoditization of cognitive work, with software engineering at the forefront?</description>
