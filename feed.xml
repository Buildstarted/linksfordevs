      <link>https://yuanchuan.dev/fun-with-stroke-dasharray</link>
      <description>The stroke-dasharray attribute in SVG is more flexible compared to the dashed style in CSS.
    While there are numerous articles and examples about its usages,

    including Line animations,
    Pie charts,
    Circular progress bars,
    or even Hamburger menu icons,
    there&amp;#39;s still something new to explore.</description>

      <link>https://dotfiles-matter.click/</link>
      <description>Dotfiles are important. We use them every day for storing configuration for all kinds of applications, knowingly or otherwise.
You know the ones, hidden in your $HOME directory, ~/.ssh/ for your ssh keys, or ~/.Xauthority (whatever the heck that does).
Something you may not know is these are legacy locations for configuration. Please do not copy their behaviour. Your application’s
configuration may be the most important thing on a user’s machine. There are now stanardised locations on major platforms for
applications to store user-specific configuration.</description>

      <description>In this episode, I had great fun chatting with La&amp;#239;la Bougri&amp;#226; about NServiceBus and how it can help with your distributed architecture. From its support for observability (including OTel) and dashboarding, to sagas and pub/sub. Even zombie and ghost messages! (spooky!). And as has been known to happen on this show - we did end up going on a tangent and geeking out about the awesome Jetbrains Rider too!

      <title>How I got robbed of my first kernel contribution</title>
      <link>https://ariel-miculas.github.io/How-I-got-robbed-of-my-first-kernel-contribution/</link>
      <description>Context
Around a year and a half ago, I’ve asked my former company for some time to
work on an issue that was impacting the debugging capabilities in our project:
gdbserver couldn’t debug multithreaded applications running on a PowerPC32
architecture.  The connection to the gdbserver was broken and it couldn’t
control the debug session anymore. Multiple people have already investigated
this problem and I had a good starting point, but we still weren’t sure in
which software component the issue lied: it could have been the toolchain, the
gdbserver, the Linux kernel or the custom patches we applied on top of the
kernel tree. We were quite far away from finding the root cause.

      <title>Update 4: Water surface simulation on the NES &amp;#183; Triple Jump: A platformer multi-cartridge for the NES</title>
      <link>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/morphcat-games/triple-jump-a-platformer-multi-cartridge-for-the-nes/posts/3918838</link>
      <description>Hi everyone,
Join us next week for an exclusive live stream on our morphcat twitch.tv channel
We will be playing all three games on Triple Jump: Spacegulls, the hell mode of Micro Mages: Second Quest and B&amp;#246;bl, all with audio commentary. We will answer questions from chat while playing.
It will most likely take place next Monday. We will let you know about the details in our next update.
On to today&amp;#39;s special...

Water surface simulation on the NES&amp;#160;
In this update, we will dive into how the water surface animations work in B&amp;#246;bl.



Surely, this has to be the most interesting technical detail about B&amp;#246;bl as it is something that has never been seen on the 8-bit NES before.

ROM versus RAM for graphics
On the NES, you have the choice to equip your cartridge with either a ROM or RAM chip for graphics. These are called CHR ROM and CHR RAM respectively.

CHR ROM
Pros

  Graphics don&amp;#39;t have to be stored in Program ROM, leaving more space for code and other data, i.e. more game content&amp;#160;
  With a memory mapper like MMC3, you can update many tiles at once with no CPU cost by swapping banks of CHR ROM

Cons

  You are usually limited to only a couple predefined frames of animation&amp;#160;




CHR RAM
Pros

  Can modify individual graphic tiles during runtime, i.e. draw on them or replace them
  Easy to achieve highly fluid animations&amp;#160;
  Allows for novel graphical effects&amp;#160;

Cons

  Graphics have to be stored in Program ROM before they are uploaded to CHR RAM, so you may have to sacrifice game content&amp;#160;
  Tile updates require CPU involvement, so there&amp;#39;s a severe limit to how many tiles you can animate at the same time




The NES game Battletoads uses CHR RAM to create interesting graphical effects, like the screen edges scrolling vertically at different speeds.
Here&amp;#39;s a close-up of the CHR RAM contents:



On to another example:
Contra... aka Probotector if you&amp;#39;re from Europe like us ;)



If there&amp;#39;s only a few tiles you need to update, CHR RAM wins. Because CHR ROM bankswitching only works in 1KB chunks, so you would waste a lot of space duplicating graphics.
More importantly, here you can easily see why background animations are useful:
While it would be much easier to use sprites for an animated electric barrier like this, if you try to line up more than 8 sprites horizontally on the NES, excess ones disappear - which games try to circumvent using the infamous sprite flickering.
However, for background tiles, there is no such limit! Everything looks just fine.

Animating the water surface
As stated earlier, the number of graphics updates the NES can do per frame is very limited.
A screen in B&amp;#246;bl can have a maximum of 32 animated water surface tiles. That&amp;#39;s the bottom two rows of tiles on the right side (CHR RAM) of this image:



&amp;#160;To reach this number of tile updates, we use two tricks:
Half of the colors
The 4-color (2-bit) graphic format on the NES uses 16 bytes per 8x8-pixel tile. B&amp;#246;bl&amp;#39;s water surface tiles use just 2 colors (1-bit), that means we get away with updating only 8 bytes per tile.




Half of the frame rate
Updates alternate: 16 tiles on even frames, the other 16 on odd frames. This means the water surface animation runs at 30fps while the rest of the game runs at 60fps. Luckily, everything still looks fluid (pun intended).

Next, let&amp;#39;s see how the water surface simulation itself works:&amp;#160;
Think of a water surface as a sequence of points. Each one describes the water level at a given x-position.




When an object hits the water surface, the vertical velocity of the of one such point is changed and it will effectively swing back and forth around the surface level. Over time, the water level will propagate to adjacent points, losing momentum in the process. Eventually, all points will return back to forming a still surface again.
Pulling this off convincingly would require a fair bit of memory and math, possibly including divisions, which are extremely slow on the poor 8-bit CPU housed inside the NES.




Luckily, the CPU does well at addition and subtraction. So our solution was to pre-generate the water deformation. I.e., we store the changes caused to the water level as a sort of animation - a sequence of numbers telling the game how much the water level should go up or down for a given point, at a particular point in time.



Then we generate the graphics tiles from the calculated levels of all water surface points with some optimized assembly code (click if you dare).
Even with all of these optimizations, the game uses 40-60% of the CPU just for the water deformation effect.

Mooore, please?
