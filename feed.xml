      <description>Yesterday evening, I gave a workshop titled "To test, or not to test" at the Software Crafters Z√ºrich Meetup. In the workshop, we gathered reasons to write tests: being confident that the code works, being confident that regressions can be prevented, helping to drive the implementation, and having documentation of the system. Interestingly, when I...</description>

      <description>Obituary for the greatest monument to logical AGI. After 40 years, 30 million rules, 200 million dollars, 2000 person-years, and many promises, Cyc has failed to reach intellectual maturity, and may never will. Exacerbated by the secrecy and insularity of Cycorp, there remains no evidence of its general intelligence.</description>

      <description>After benchmarking the R1 1776 model and seeing how post training influenced its performance (full post here), I realized another gap.

Models that can technically handle a huge context window often degrade long before you hit their max token limit.

Plenty of benchmarks test for raw throughput or model quality</description>

      <title>In praise of Gleam's decode</title>
      <link>https://jonashedeng.github.io/posts/gleam-decode/</link>
      <description>When first encountering Gleam‚Äôs approach to encoding/decoding data to/from outside of Gleam, I (just as many other people new to Gleam) think it strange that such a modern and well-thought out language still has a relatively verbose and manual-ish[1] way of doing it. I‚Äôve now realized I much prefer this approach over some combination of terseness, weird dedicated syntax, macros, magics, etc.
While working on a little side project I‚Äôm doing just for fun (and to learn), I encountered an ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù data structure that I wanted to extract a couple of fields from. Initially I thought it to be a basic dictionary-like data structure but I soon realized it was a bit more convoluted.</description>
