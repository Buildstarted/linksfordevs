      <title>Response Compression In ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/response-compression-in-aspnetcore</link>
      <description> Reducing the size of your API responses can noticeably improve the performance of your application.
And since network bandwidth is a limited resource, you should at least consider the benefits of response compression.
Here&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;ll learn in this week&amp;#39;s newsletter: - How to configure response compression in .NET - Server-based vs. application-based compression - Possible security risks and mitigation strategies - How to configure the available compression providers - How much network bandwidth you could be saving
Let&amp;#39;s get started.</description>

      <title>The DenseLayers Story, Episode I: The Pre-Seed Fundraise from Hell - Aman Y. Agarwal</title>
      <link>https://aman-agarwal.com/2023/06/22/the-denselayers-story-episode-i-the-pre-seed-fundraise-from-hell/</link>
      <description>Background Towards the end of February this year, I decided (or rather, a friend pushed me to decide) to bring DenseLayers back from the ashes and work on it full-time. I was in a pretty bad place at the time — my first business had been unsuccessful. And not even in a spectacular fashion. It had been squirming in darkness for over a year, gradually losing blood, dying a slow, painful death, clinging on to “hope” till the very end. I didn’t lose any money on it, but I probably could have quit 2 years sooner. Two years of youth...</description>

      <title>Racket frustrates me</title>
      <link>https://blog.winny.tech/posts/racket-frustrates-me/</link>
      <description>Sorry if I upset any of the nice Racket folks out there.
It’s time for a little reality check. First, repeat after me:
 Coding is a tool to get stuff done. If you let your programming language impact your productivity, you are not in charge, the technology is calling the shots.
 Why would I use Racket today? Do I want to iterate every 18 hours waiting for the pkgs.</description>

      <description>Toyota Production System and waste Link to heading It was around ~2011 when I first read The Toyota Way book. This book introduced me to The Toyota Way principles and the Toyota Production System (TPS). It laid the foundation for me to understand the Continuous Delivery book which I later read.
The Toyota Way also lay the groundwork for me to understand the inter-related Lean Manufacturing, particularly Lean services (which applies the Lean concept to the service industry).</description>

      <title>Going Multi-Region with Zero Devops</title>
      <link>https://pqvst.com/2023/06/30/going-multi-region-with-zero-devops/</link>
      <description>I’ve been a huge fan of DigitalOcean for many years, and one of my SaaS businesses, AwardFares, has lived there for the past 5 years. We initially ran everything on a couple of Droplets (Ubuntu VPS that we managed ourselves). When DigitalOcean announced their app platform we immediately migrated our app to that, reducing devops to nearly zero. Our database, however, remained as a single mongodb instance running on a self-managed VPS.</description>

      <description>Figma has been in the news lately, probably as a result of their Config event where they announced a bunch of new features. Vercel’s CEO gave a talk about something-something React Components, I think. That, in turn, seems to have spawned a few takes about Figma really being an unnecessary intermediate step: designers should just write HTML and CSS. I disagree.</description>
