      <title>Thank you for helping us increase our bandwidth - Internet Archive Blogs</title>
      <link>https://blog.archive.org/2020/05/11/thank-you-for-helping-us-increase-our-bandwidth/</link>
      <description>Last week the Internet Archive upped our bandwidth capacity 30%, based on increased usage and increased financial support.  Thank you. This is our outbound bandwidth graph that has several stories to tell… A year ago, usage was 30Gbits/sec. At the beginning of this year, we were at 40Gbits/sec, and we were handling it.  That is […]</description>

      <title>Performance Characteristics of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay and Seroprevalence in Boise, Idaho</title>
      <link>https://jcm.asm.org/content/early/2020/05/07/JCM.00941-20</link>
      <description>Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort. We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States. We expect the availability of high-quality serological testing will be a key tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Guitar Effect Emulation</title>
      <link>https://teddykoker.com/2020/05/deep-learning-for-guitar-effect-emulation/</link>
      <description>Since the 1940s, electric guitarists, keyboardists, and other instrumentalists have been using effects pedals, devices that modify the sound of the original audio source. Typical effects include distortion, compression, chorus, reverb, and delay. Early effects pedals consisted of basic analog circuits, often along with vacuum tubes, which were later replaced with transistors. Although many pedals today apply effects digitally with modern signal processing techniques, many purists argue that the sound of analog pedals can not be replaced by their digital counterparts. We’ll follow a deep learning approach to see if we can use machine learning to replicate the sound of an iconic analog effect pedal, the Ibanez Tube Screamer. This post will be mostly a reproduction of the work done by Alec Wright et al. in Real-Time Guitar Amplifier Emulation with Deep Learning1.

      <description>More and more people are being exposed to working remotely. One of the key factors for success in a remote workplace is a culture of written communication. It’s not always obvious how to create such a culture, and it takes at least some level of discipline from the people involved to make it a habit.</description>

      <link>https://www.neilwithdata.com/advanced-sql</link>
      <description>For people who've worked through Mastery with SQL, a common question I get is "What's next?" If you completed the course and all 150+ exercises, at this point you'll have a very strong grasp of SQL and should be comfortable writing all sorts of complex queries. However, there's more to working with databases effectively - you might start to become interested in topics like database design, performance, transactions, locking, logging, security, configuration, and much more. Or you might want to dive deeper on the specific capabilities of the database you're using (e.g. Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).</description>

      <link>https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/data-point-for-job-seeking-devs/</link>
      <description>I wrapped up my job search recently, and I’m happy to say that I’ll be joining a YC-backed startup called “Heap.” I thought I’d share a little bit about my job search in case the information may benefit other job-seeking devs. I’ll go over the pipeline of places I applied to and the result of each application. I’ll also talk about things like salary, resume formatting, coding challenge prep, and interviewing. I don’t intend any of this to be advice. Rather, I hope it’ll be a data point that other job-seeking devs could use to inform their own expectations about their search.</description>

      <description>In the upcoming .NET 5 a very interesting change is added to the GC – a dedicated Pinned Object Heap, a very new type of the managed heap segment (as we have Small and Large Object Heaps so far). Pinning has its own costs, because it introduces fragmentation (and in general complicates object compaction a lot). We are used to have some good practices about it, like “pin only for…:</description>
