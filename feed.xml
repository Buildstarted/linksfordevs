      <title>State of OpenID Connect Providers</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/state-of-openid-connect-providers/</link>
      <description>In the last days I tried to integrate multiple OpenID Connect Providers into my Applications (currently mostly Alphalerts and some dev projects)
So far, I only got Google to work, and even this is currently limited to 100 Users. In this blog post, I want to explain why the integration of OpenID Connect Providers is such a struggle by showing multiple examples.
But before I show the examples, you should know that there are not so many big OpenID Connect Providers compared to the big OAuth2 Providers.</description>

      <title>How to visualize your system architecture using the C4 model?</title>
      <link>https://jorzel.github.io/how-to-visualize-your-system-architecture-using-the-c4-model/</link>
      <description>As a software developer or system architect you often have a task to visualize your existing or potential application architecture for other people. Your audience can be software developers, but also business stakeholders (Customers, Product Owners, CEO, etc.). The architecture diagram should take on a distinctive look depending on whatever group you choose to present for your work. In this article, I’d want to give an illustration of how the C4 model might be used to easily target the various audiences mentioned above.

      <title>Trading with BDDs</title>
      <link>https://taeric.github.io/trading-with-bdds.html</link>
      <description>At work, we had a fun &amp;quot;hackathon&amp;quot; where we looked at finding the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot;
buy/sell strategy in a stock history.  Not shockingly, finding the single
best option was easy.  Extending to find the best  trades expectedly
slowed down everyone.  I know that I am terrible at dynamic programming
techniques, so I mostly sat that one out.  I did give it a try later, but
didn&amp;#39;t come up with anything of note.  (And I was shown a leetcode writeup
on the normal methods for doing this.)</description>

      <title>Implementing the MySQL server protocol for fun and profit</title>
      <link>https://ochagavia.nl/blog/implementing-the-mysql-server-protocol-for-fun-and-profit/</link>
      <description>In December 2021, a company from San Francisco asked me to port a Rust library to Java. The task seemed simple, but it ended up requiring a from-scratch implementation of the MySQL protocol and even fixing a bug in the main Rust MySQL client! Below follows an account of the adventure.
The task Originally, the idea was to port the msql-srv library from Rust to Java. For context, msql-srv makes it possible to create a fake MySQL/MariaDB server, which accepts MySQL connections and handles them with custom logic (instead of having a real database behind it).</description>
