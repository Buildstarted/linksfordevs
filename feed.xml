      <description>I received a bug report from Debian today, who had fed some garbage into
scdoc, and it gave them a SIGSEGV back.
Diving into this problem gave me a good opportunity to draw a comparison between
musl libc and glibc. Let’s start with the stack trace:</description>

      <title>Dawood Iddris - The Future of Tech and How to Keep in Touch While It Evolves [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFurgKKrwGw</link>
      <description>Building and leading communities, one of the common pitfall many people fall in whiles trying to gain grounds in technology has to do with learning every new thing they hear of. It is quite clear that these people think they are doing the right thing until they realize years have passed by and yet they can't build a single project with their knowledge gained. As several people share their stories with me about the same problem, I notice I was in their shoes for my first two years career. In this session, we will address how people who find their self in this category can progress while staying up to date with all new technologies.

      <title>How to properly manage ssh keys for server access :: Päpper's Coding Blog — Have fun coding.</title>
      <link>https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/how-to-properly-manage-ssh-keys-for-server-access/</link>
      <description>Every developer needs access to some servers for example to check the application logs.
Usually, this is done using public-private key encryption where each developer generates their own public-private key pair. The public keys of each developer are added to the authorized_keys file on each server they should have access to.
Painful manual changes So far so good. However, what happens when one developer leaves the company?
In that case, the public keys of that developer should be removed from all servers.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week, Microsoft released Bridge to Kubernetes, a Visual Studio extension that allows developers to write, test and debug microservice code locally while consuming dependencies from a Kubernetes environment.

      <title>SQLite Is Dynamically Typed</title>
      <link>https://blog.zachwf.com/posts/sqlite-is-dynamically-typed/</link>
      <description>A small, cool fact about SQLite is that its columns are flexibly typed. You can store any value in any column! Try it out:
sqlite&gt; create table t1 (v1 int, v2 varchar(10)); sqlite&gt; insert into t1 values ("abc", "this string is longer than 10 characters!"); sqlite&gt; select * from t1; abc|this string is longer than 10 characters! sqlite&gt; select typeof(v1), typeof(v2) from t1; text|text The null type is still special:</description>
