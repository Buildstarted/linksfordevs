      <description>A Learning and Development vision is one of the most powerful tools you can use to improve your organisation&amp;#39;s learning culture.
An L&amp;amp;D vision describes the future you want to create for your organisation.
A good vision depicts 2-5 years into the future.
Anything shorter term is more a short-term goal than a vision.
For example, your short-term goal might be to increased your click rate by 10% in the next quarter, while your vision might be to become the leading provider of affordable education in the world.</description>

      <title>Start With a Minimum Viable System</title>
      <link>https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/start-with-a-minimum-viable-system</link>
      <description>After college, my first big programming project for work was to build a
CRUD app from
scratch. The most important lesson that I learned from it was that when I’m in
an unfamiliar environment, I should prefer to build a minimum viable system by
developing things vertically instead of horizontally. That means building just a
portion of a layer and then moving to the next layer as quickly as possible.
Rather than building out entire layers sequentially. Connecting the pieces of a
system can be surprisingly challenging, which means that if I leave it to the
end, I can run into unexpected issues and slowdowns.</description>

      <title>How To Find A Therapist</title>
      <link>https://mikemcquaid.com/how-to-find-a-therapist/</link>
      <description>In 2020, due to the “fun” combination of COVID-19 and two young children at home, I wanted to see an (individual) therapist. At the time I was employed by GitHub, which had a program where I could get up to six sessions paid for by them. After five of these, I’d found some benefits but wanted to try a different approach with a therapist of my choice. Based on my experience finding a therapist, I’ve outlined how I (and several friends at this point) went about doing so.</description>

      <title>Week1.2 What I need to do to set up my machine?</title>
      <link>https://hhya7iyw.github.io/week-one-two-what-a-setup/</link>
      <description>ordered a MacBook, but it wasn&amp;#39;t ready for me yet.
Instead, I got this big, clunky Windows laptop.
It was heavy, you could easily kill someone or yourself just by carrying it.
I booted it up, and the first thing it did was to update Windows.
In the meantime, my manager gave me my AD login and told me to request admin rights.
After 30 minutes of Windows update and restarts, I finally saw the login screen.</description>
