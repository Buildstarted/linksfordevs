      <title>The /bin/true Command and Copyright</title>
      <link>http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/humor/ATT_Copyright_true.html</link>
      <description>One of the fun examples among all the copyright fuss is the  extreme  example
of  copyright claims made by AT&amp;amp;T some time in the 1980s.  It&amp;#39;s the /bin/true
program.  This is a &amp;quot;dummy&amp;quot; library program whose main function is to make it
easy  to  write  infinite  loops  (while true do ...) in shells scripts.  The
&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; program does nothing; it merely exits with a zero exit  status.   This
can  be  done with an empty file that&amp;#39;s marked executable, and that&amp;#39;s what it
was in the earliest unix system  libraries.   Such  an  empty  file  will  be
interpreted  as  a  shell  script  that  does nothing, and since it does this
successfully, the shell exits with a zero exit status.   But  AT&amp;amp;T&amp;#39;s  lawyers
decided that this was worthy of copyright protection.</description>

      <title>Teach Your Kids Bridge - Speculative Branches</title>
      <link>https://specbranch.com/posts/teach-bridge/</link>
      <description>A post recently made the rounds on hacker news claiming that
you should teach your kids poker, not chess.
The comments on that post go through a lot of the reasons why poker is a bad game to teach your
children, but I felt that I was well suited to opine on this topic, and explain why duplicate
bridge is the best game for practicing the life skills involved in business and programming,
compared to all of the alternatives.</description>

      <title>Databases = Frameworks for Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://laplab.me/posts/databases-are-frameworks-for-distributed-systems/</link>
      <description>This article was originally posted on dev.to, but it turns out that HackerNews banned this website, so I decided to create my own.
 Lego of the database world It is quite common for a distributed database to have the following components:
  Distributed Storage Usually, this component has an interface of a key-value store: Get(key) and Set(key, value), where key and value are some binary strings. This component knows nothing about the data - it can be rows from the table, JSON documents or something else entirely.</description>

      <title>Visual Debugging Now!</title>
      <link>https://nickarner.com/notes/visual-debugging-now-may-20-2022/</link>
      <description>Guest post from Anton Troynikov
Over the last seven or so years of working in robotics and computer vision, the bitter lesson I’ve learned is that the bug is almost always in the part of the algorithm you didn’t visualize.
This is a call to fix that problem once and for all.
The Problem Many domains, including robotics, foundationally rely on highly performant numerical software. But since humans are adapted to understand space visually, we don’t have good intuitions for numerical data.</description>
