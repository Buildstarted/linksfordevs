      <title>Building a community platform</title>
      <link>https://jlericson.com/2023/11/04/platform_building_so.html</link>
      <description>Before we got married, my wife and I visited Teotihuacan near Mexico City. We climbed the massive Pyramid of the Moon and had our picture taken with the even larger Pyramid of the Sun behind us. The enormous complex was built over hundreds of years by a civilization that preceded the Aztecs. Archaeological and historical evidence tell us the place where we stood was previously used for animal and human sacrifices. It&amp;#39;s now a tourist destination.</description>

      <title>True code readability doesn&amp;#39;t exist! But you&amp;#39;ll feel when it really is</title>
      <link>https://moonthought.github.io/posts/true-readability-doesnt-exist-and-youll-feel-when-it-really-is/</link>
      <description>The question of what code readability is (as part of mystical DX in general) is often raised lately. And more and more people have started to say that readability is purely a matter of preference. I can’t blame them. After many years of development, we may catch ourselves thinking that we are already quite capable of perceiving different code of various quality, paradigms and languages. We can also get used to tools that at first seemed uncomfortable to us.</description>

      <title>HiPhish&amp;#39;s Workshop</title>
      <link>https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2023/10/18/grayjay-is-not-open-source/</link>
      <description>Today FUTO released an application called Grayjay for Android-based mobile
phones.  Louis Rossmann introduced the application in a video (YouTube
link).  Grayjay as an application
is very promising, but there is one point I take issue with: Grayjay is not an
Open Source application.  In the video Louis explains his reason behind the
custom license, and while I do agree with his reason, I strong disagree with
his method.  In this post I will explain what Open Source means, how Grayjay
does not meet the criteria, why this is an issue, and how it can be solved.</description>
