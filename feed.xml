      <title>ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; and strings - How not to compare them</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/969cc5e7-da27-4742-ae9a-ab7a66715ff6</link>
      <description>Many know that you can take ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; objects when dealing with strings. They give you a direct way of operating on the underlying memory. Often times you can use them interchangeably, but there are scenarios where you really have to watch out what is going on.
This blog post will have a look at a major problem with ReadOnlySpan when used like a &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; string.

      <description>Ready for some space? Richard talks to Carl about all the incredible space-related stories in 2022. Starting with a record launch year - more flights to orbit than any year in history! Then the conversation digs into some cool missions around the solar system, including the Double Asteroid Redirection Test - we&amp;#39;re learning how to protect our planet against asteroid impacts! Then on to space stations (there&amp;#39;s more than one!) and, of course, the Moon - so many missions to the Moon! The biggest is Artemis, but</description>

      <title>Rehearsing a sabbatical &amp;#183; Max Gorin</title>
      <link>https://mxgrn.com/blog/rehearsing-a-sabbatical</link>
      <description>This fall, I went hiking in the Nepali Himalayas for the first time since the pandemic. A village called Namche Bazar is my favorite place to unwind from work, and usually I need at least a month off to get properly recharged. This time, even though I took a whole 6 weeks, I decided I needed more, but not because I got exceptionally tired of my current job.</description>

      <title>How I spent two months doing nothing</title>
      <link>https://proofinprogress.com/posts/2022-12-28/How-I-spent-two-months-doing-nothing.html</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;m really struggling with being productive these days. As seen on my GitHub contributors activity, I last shipped code two months ago. And only just sitting here writing kind of bores me too. I&amp;#39;ve reflected on what makes me bored: Am I burned out? Am I just taking a break? Why now? And what am I doing with all of this free time?</description>

      <title>The Catch-22 of Democracy - Pravesh Koirala</title>
      <link>https://praveshkoirala.com/2022/12/28/the-catch-22-of-democracy/</link>
      <description>There have been many things written and said about Democracy. I agree with some of those, disagree with the most. Unlike many people believe, I do not consider Democracy as the best system of governance. In my academically (or otherwise) limited opinion, it&amp;#39;s just the better among all the worst that we can possibly choose.</description>

      <description>This is the website for an automatic theorem proving project funded by the Astera Institute. It is based in Cambridge, but we are open to remote collaboration with others who may be interested. The focus will be on traditional programming methods, but we hope and expect that some of the work we do will have the potential to feed into approaches based on machine learning.</description>
