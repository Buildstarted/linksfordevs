      <title>AIR-FI: Generating Covert Wi-Fi Signals from Air-Gapped Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06884</link>
      <description>In this paper, we show that attackers can exfiltrate data from air-gapped
computers via Wi-Fi signals. Malware in a compromised air-gapped computer can
generate signals in the Wi-Fi frequency bands. The signals are generated
through the memory buses - no special hardware is required. Sensitive data can
be modulated and secretly exfiltrated on top of the signals. We show that
nearby Wi-Fi capable devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops, IoT devices) can
intercept these signals, decode them, and send them to the attacker over the
Internet. To extract the signals, we utilize the physical layer information
exposed by the Wi-Fi chips. We implement the transmitter and receiver and
discuss design considerations and implementation details. We evaluate this
covert channel in terms of bandwidth and distance and present a set of
countermeasures. Our evaluation shows that data can be exfiltrated from
air-gapped computers to nearby Wi-Fi receivers located a distance of several
meters away.</description>

      <title>Why does PF_VIRT_FIRMWARE_ENABLED return false even when virtualization is enabled in the firmware? | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201216-00/?p=104550</link>
      <description>The Is&amp;#173;Processor&amp;#173;Feature&amp;#173;Present function has a processor feature called PF_VIRT_FIRMWARE_ENABLED. A customer enabled virtualization in their firmware, but calling Is&amp;#173;Processor&amp;#173;Feature&amp;#173;Present with that feature still returned FALSE. Why is this function lying? It’s not lying. Even if you enable virtualization in firmware, it may not actually be available.</description>

      <title>To the brain, reading computer code is not the same as reading language</title>
      <link>https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215</link>
      <description>MIT neuroscientists have found reading computer code does not rely on the regions of the brain involved in language processing. Instead, it activates the “multiple demand network,” which is also recruited for complex cognitive tasks such as solving math problems or crossword puzzles.</description>

      <description>Bad air is bad for you. The air purifier market, though, is a mess. Every purifier uses incompatible proprietary filters, presumably to lock you into buying replacements forever. How do we know these actually work? Few seem to publish lab tests. And why does it cost $100-$300 for a big plastic box with a fan and a filter inside?</description>

      <title>How Tail Call Optimization Works</title>
      <link>https://eklitzke.org/how-tail-call-optimization-works</link>
      <description>Most undergraduate computer sciences courses teach students about tail call
optimization (TCO), and even if you
don&amp;#39;t have a formal computer science background the concept is talked about
enough that you might be familiar with it anyway, especially if you&amp;#39;ve ever done
any functional programming. However, I think the way TCO is normally taught is
very confusing, because it&amp;#39;s normally taught in the context of recursion. It&amp;#39;s
taught this way because without TCO many recursive functions can blow up the
stack causing a stack overflow. Therefore by teaching people about TCO in the
context of recursion, you can teach them why optimizing compilers (or
interpreters) can run tail recursive code efficiently and without causing a
stack overflow.</description>

      <title>The story of the one line fix – Dave Cheney</title>
      <link>https://dave.cheney.net/2020/12/15/the-story-of-the-one-line-fix</link>
      <description>Picture yourself, an engineer working at the hottest distributed microservices de jour, assigned to fix a bug. You jump into an unfamiliar codebase and quickly locate the line where the problem occurred. The fix is simple, just return early or substitute a default value in the case that one cannot be determined from your input. Boom, problem solved. Code compiles, fix goes out to production, and the card’s in the done pile in time for Tuesday drinks at the pub.</description>
