      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8/</link>
      <description>Today we’re proud to release TypeScript 3.8!
For those unfamiliar with TypeScript, it’s a language that adds syntax for types on top of JavaScript which can be analyzed through a process called static type-checking. This type-checking can tell us about errors like typos and values that are potentially null and undefined before we even run our code.</description>

      <title>Null API Responses and HTTP 204 Results in ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Feb/24/Null-API-Responses-and-HTTP-204-Results-in-ASPNET-Core</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core's default API handlers return an HTTP 204 response for null value results. This is meant to be a convenience feature, but if your calling API depends on a proper JSON response or an HTTP 200 result code, it can cause applications to break. In this post I'll describe why this can be a problem and how you can return proper JSON results for null values.</description>

Absolutely yes: the native support to JSON offered by Azure SQL will also help a lot again. In addition to that, the Micro-ORM Dapper will make the inte...</description>

      <title>On Voice Coding</title>
      <link>https://dusty.phillips.codes/2020/02/15/on-voice-coding/</link>
      <description>I have had repetitive stress injury (RSI) flareups on and off for many years. I’ve kept them under control mostly through use of an Kinesis Advantage ergonomic keyboard that I’ve had for fifteen years. However, several months ago, I was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and instructed to avoid typing if at all possible.
I make my living programming and writing. My hobbies are programming and writing.
The first thing I had to do was completely scrap two book projects.</description>
