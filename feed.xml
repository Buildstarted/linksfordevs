      <title>Unix command line conventions over time</title>
      <link>https://blog.liw.fi/posts/2022/05/07/unix-cli/</link>
      <description>This blog post documents my understanding of how the conventions for Unix command line syntax have evolved over time. It’s not properly sourced, and may well be quite wrong. I’ve not been using Unix until 1989, so I wasn’t there for the early years. Maybe someone has written a proper essay on this, with citations. I’m too lazy to dig them up.</description>

      <title>Why a Meeting Costs More than a MacBook Pro – the Business Case for Fewer Developers in Meetings</title>
      <link>https://blog.shimin.io/the-business-case-for-fewer-developer-meetings/</link>
      <description>The meeting&amp;#39;s opportunity cost is higher than the price of a brand-new M1 MacBook Pro. If the meeting was pointless, might as well cancel it and fly one of the devs to Bali instead.</description>

      <title>Why I’ve spent my Easter break customizing Neovim – Franciszek Malinka</title>
      <link>https://framal.xyz/why-ive-spent-my-easter-break-customizing-neovim/</link>
      <description>Alright, so you might think that there are better ways to spend your Easter break than sitting all of your evenings customizing Neovim with no prior knowledge. You’re probably right. Sceptics may also say that I’ve reproduced VSCode instead of simply using it. They are also probably right. Or are they?</description>

      <title>Too Much of a Good Thing</title>
      <link>https://hunterirving.com/blog/too_much_of_a_good_thing</link>
      <description>Nearly fifteen years after the first iPhone, most phones still look like iPhones. Large, responsive touchscreens have replaced the squeaky navigational keys of yore, and our phones have evolved beyond simple communication tools to become &amp;quot;everything devices&amp;quot;. Endless entertainment, all the world&amp;#39;s knowledge, and a slew of bottomless social media feeds now live in our pockets.</description>

      <title>A Solution to the Halting Problem</title>
      <link>https://nickdrozd.github.io/2022/05/05/halting-problem-solution.html</link>
      <description>Please excuse my clickbait title. It was intended to trigger the emotions of the kind of people who get worked up about computability theory. Of course I don’t have a solution to the halting problem – there is no such thing. Instead, I want to talk about a partial solution to the halting problem, a method to solve it for certain instances. And to make up for the misleading title, I’ll also discuss how to extend the method to other similar problems.</description>
