      <title>Making Emacs popular again</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/819452/1480c3a59d3d9093/</link>
      <description>The Emacs editor predates
Linux, and was once far more popular, but it 
  has fallen into relative obscurity over the years.
In a mega-thread on the emacs-devel mailing list, participants discussed
various ideas for making Emacs more "attractive", in both aesthetic
and in  "appealing to more users" senses of that term.  Any improvements
to Emacs in that regard have numerous hurdles to overcome, however.  There
are technical questions and, naturally, licensing considerations, but
there is also the philosophical question of what it is, exactly, that stops
the venerable text editor from being more popular.</description>

      <title>Hack Yourself First: How to go on the Cyber-Offence - NDC Oslo 2020 | Software Developers Conference</title>
      <link>https://ndcoslo.com/workshop/hack-yourself-first-how-to-go-on-the-cyber-offence/</link>
      <description>Cyber-attacks have become a reality of running software on the web today. We find ourselves under a constant barrage of malicious activity from hacktivists, online criminals and increasingly, nation states. Successful attacks from these adversaries are predominantly via flaws in the software products they target – flaws that could have been prevented by developers understanding how online attackers work and what the appropriate defensive measures are.&lt;br&gt;</description>
