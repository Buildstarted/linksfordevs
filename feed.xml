      <title>Putting a vaccine out quickly, part 3</title>
      <link>https://yarchive.net/blog/quick-vaccine3/</link>
      <description>If anyone had been in the mood to argue with my previous missives
about getting a vaccine out quickly, they could have easily found an
objection.  &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re only addressing testing&amp;quot;, they might have said,
&amp;quot;and the real problem is manufacturing.  It&amp;#39;s fine to test a vaccine
fast, but the real struggle is going to be in the process of gearing
up to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses.  Even most of the
regulatory work deals with details of manufacturing.  And since we can
do testing in parallel with gearing up for manufacturing, and the
gearing up for manufacturing will take longer, we don&amp;#39;t need to do
testing as fast as you suggest.&amp;quot;</description>
