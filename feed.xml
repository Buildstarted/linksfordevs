      <title>Speech Synthesis on Linux</title>
      <link>https://darkshadow.io/2020/08/01/speech-synthesis-on-linux.html</link>
      <description>The main options are espeak, Gnuspeech, spd-say, MBROLA, PicoTTS and the festvox project which festival and flite are part of. While I found espeak to be the simplest system to use, festival produced the best results when used with the right voices. This post shall outline the various ways festival can be used and the steps required to achieve good results.</description>

      <title>Frequency + Common Goal + Vulnerability = Great Friends — Juan David Campolargo</title>
      <link>https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/friendships-frequency</link>
      <description>Friends don’t need to have similar interests. They need a common goal.    Who would you say your friends are? Would you say those who you grew up close with? Those whom you work with? Well, some of my best friends are all over the world and they all have different interests.&amp;nbsp;  How can we be</description>

      <title>Why I Self-Host My Website Analytics</title>
      <link>https://mbuffett.com/posts/why-i-self-host-my-analytics/</link>
      <description>Recently I made the switch to self-hosted analytics, after being a long-term Google Analytics user. Almost every website you visit will have a Google Analytics tracker on it. I think there are idealogical and technical reasons to opt for self-hosted analytics instead.
Tracking efficacy This one’s quick. You’re more likely to get analytics for a given user if you’re using self-hosted analytics, than if you’re using Google Analytics. About 26% of people are running adblockers now, a large percentage of which will also block tracking scripts, like GA.</description>
