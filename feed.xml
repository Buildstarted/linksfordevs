      <description>This post is about implementing model validation in ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs. Minimal APIs do not come with any built-in support for validation.

      <description>An important property satisfied by any Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol is agreement, which requires non-faulty replicas to not decide on conflicting values. Depending on the network model, typical consensus protocols tolerate only a fraction of Byzantine replicas. In particular, under partial synchrony or asynchrony, no consensus protocol with $n$...</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Docker Gotchas and Workarounds</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/aspnet-docker-gotchas-and-workarounds</link>
      <description>I’ve recently been working with Docker deployments to get my ASP.NET Core applications into the hands of more developers. The whole experience has been generally positive, and it is reminiscent of the early days of Git deployments. Write some code, test it locally, push changes, and voila! I have an application running in the cloud, only this time, there’s no need to check whether the cloud environment has any particular dependencies. However, like any approach, there are going to be some downsides that we should consider.</description>

      <title>Avoid Using Exceptions to Determine API Status Codes and Responses</title>
      <link>https://ardalis.com/avoid-using-exceptions-determine-api-status/</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s typical for API endpoints to call application or domain services. In the case of success, the API can simply return Ok and the result of the service call. But for non-success cases, should you use exceptions to communicate from the service to the endpoint, so that it can return an appropriate status code and response?</description>

      <title>Azure DevOps Podcast: Eilon Lipton on Blazor Desktop - Episode 166</title>
      <link>http://azuredevopspodcast.clear-measure.com/eilon-lipton-on-blazor-desktop-episode-166</link>
      <description>This week, Eilon Lipton is joining the podcast! Eilon is a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft. Eilon has been entrenched in the .NET world since it publicly came out. He started out as an intern at Microsoft on the ASP.NET team in 2000 and then came back to Microsoft in a full-time position in 2002 and has been with the company ever since. Some of his career highlights include working on the update panel control, seeing technologies like Blazor come around and bringing C# off of the server and into the client space as a manager of ASP.NET, and working on the first versions of NVC and Web API as an engineer and engineering manager. &amp;amp;nbsp; In this episode, Eilon is discussing the ins and outs of Blazor Desktop — which is currently 100% of what he’s been working on. He takes listeners on a deep-dive of Blazor Desktop, sharing what they need to know in anticipation of .NET 6 and the GA drop of Visual Studio 2022 coming out. He also touches on WPF, WinForms, MAUI, and the 2021 DEVintersection Conference. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:39] About The Azure DevOps Podcast, Clear Measure; the new video podcast Architect Tips; and Jeffrey’s offer to speak at virtual user groups. [1:15] About today’s episode with Eilon Lipton. [1:30] Jeffrey welcomes Eilon to the podcast. [1:45] Eilon shares highlights from his career and how he first arrived at Microsoft. [4:54] About today’s topic of conversation with Eilon: Blazor Desktop. [5:45] What Blazor Desktop means for developers. [5:55] Eilon shares his vision for Blazor Desktop. [9:02] Eilon gives a run-through of the options available for Blazor Desktop. [10:49] What’s the relationship between the Blazor web view control and Web view 2? [12:52] Does the Blazor web view give you more access to the operating system than a browser normally does? [15:05] Is there a useable preview that’s coming out soon for .NET MAUI? [17:51] When you download the GA of VS ‘22, is the latest MAUI going to be ready to go or do you need to download a subsequent installer? [19:05] With Blazor Desktop, is there a default wrapper or does it ask you to pick a WPF shell or WinForms shell? What is the normal path if you just want one Blazor application to be Windows native? [24:18] A word from The Azure DevOps Podcast’s sponsor: Clear Measure. [24:50] Eilon speaks about the development environment for Blazor Desktop. [28:08] Are they still working toward getting an actual relational database to be possible in the browser sandbox? [30:26] Is there any special workflow with how Eilon and his team work on Blazor Desktop? [34:07] Would it be possible to [38:08] In Blazor Desktop, is it native UI controls or web widgets that are rendered? [39:36] Is Blazor mobile bindings carrying forward into MAUI? Is it intended to be used so that it feels more like a mobile app over there vs. on Windows or Mac, looking more like how your web application would look? [42:50] Is it part of the Blazor Desktop vision to extend it to WinForms or WPF? [46:58] Where to find more information about Blazor Desktop online and how to get in touch with Eilon.&amp;amp;nbsp; [49:16] About the upcoming DEVintersection Conference. &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  — New video podcast!

      <description>OK, I will admit that this title is rather a hyperbole, or a click-bait. However, it is also not a lie. Here is the story. I am adding full-text search capability to Datalevin, a Datalog database that we open sourced last year. For this task, I have decided to write …</description>

      <title>Nothing Scales - Jason Kerwin</title>
      <link>https://jasonkerwin.com/nonparibus/2021/11/03/nothing-scales/</link>
      <description>I recently posted a working paper where we argue that appointments can substitute for financial commitment devices. I’m pretty proud of this paper: it uses a meticulously-designed experiment to show the key result, and the empirical work is very careful and was all pre-specified. We apply the latest and best practices in selecting controls and … Continue reading &amp;quot;Nothing Scales&amp;quot;</description>

      <title>I will pay you cash to delete your npm module</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2021/11/16/Cash-for-leftpad.html</link>
      <description>npm’s culture presents a major problem for global software security. It’s
grossly irresponsible to let dependency trees grow to thousands of dependencies,
from vendors you may have never heard of and likely have not critically
evaluated, to solve trivial tasks which could have been done from scratch in
mere seconds, or, if properly considered, might not even be needed in the first
place.</description>

      <title>The Many Uses of Schedulers</title>
      <link>https://eruhinim.com/post/many-uses-of-schedulers/</link>
      <description>Let’s say you don’t have unlimited resources. Be it RAM, access to files, CPU slots, whatever you can think of. And then you have multiple workloads that will need said resources. That’s where scheduling comes in. Scheduling comes in MANY shapes and sizes including ones you haven’t even suspected of.
Scheduler types Here we explore the various scheduler algorithms that deal with scheduling tasks. Keep in mind I also tried to unify the terminology used so a task forms a unit of work that scheduler schedules.</description>

      <title>What is Babel? &amp;#183; Karl Tarvas</title>
      <link>https://www.karltarvas.com/2021/10/16/what-is-babel.html</link>
      <description>Babel is a common part of many frontend build pipelines. But what is it, and what would you use it for? To answer that question, let’s first take a step back and talk about web browsers and Javascript. Modern Javascript has learned many tricks in the recent years (such as nullish coalescing, template literals, default parameters, and many more). These new language features often allow the developer to write code that’s either more robust, or shorter, or easier to reason about, or all of the above. Alas, many of your users may be using an older browser that was released before these features made it into the language spec. What’s a developer to do?</description>

It asks implementers to make addresses in the prior loopback range 127.1.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 fully usable for unicast use on the Internet.</description>

      <title>Bramble: A Purely Functional Build System and Package Manager</title>
      <link>https://maxmcd.com/posts/bramble/</link>
      <description>About a year and a half ago I decided to start working on a build system inspired by Nix called Bramble. Andrew Chambers had launched hermes and I was messing around with starlark-go a bit and it seemed like writing a Nix-inspired functional build system with Starlark would be a nice way to better understand how they work.
Bramble is no longer a test project, and has matured into something that I think has a few interesting ideas worth sharing.</description>
