      <title>In Praise of AutoHotKey • Hillel Wayne</title>
      <link>https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/ahk/</link>
      <description>People think it’s weird that I do all my development on a Windows machine. It’s definitely a second-class citizen experience in the wider development world, and Windows has a lot of really frustrating issues, but it’s still my favorite operating system. This is for exactly one reason: AutoHotKey.
AHK is an engine for mapping keystrokes to scripts. I wouldn’t call it particularly elegant, and it’s filled with tons of redundancy and quirks.</description>

      <description>For the last 2,5 years some of our best engineers have been working on a next-generation blockchain platform called TON and a cryptocurrency we were going to name Gram. TON was designed to share the principles of decentralization pioneered by Bitcoin and Ethereum, but to be vastly superior to them in speed and scalability. 
We were very proud with the result – the technology we created allowed for an open, free, decentralized exchange of value and ideas. When integrated with Telegram, TON had the potential…</description>

      <description>The P5P ProtocolAbstract
			This is the specification of the "Pretty Please Platform for 
			Participating Publishers" (P5P). This document, along with its 
			normative references, includes all the specification necessary for 
			the implementation of interoperable P5P clients and servers.
			Introduction"Pretty Please Platform for Participating 
			Publishers" (P5P) is a modest proposal that enables users to express 
			their privacy and other preferences in a standard format that can be 
			retrieved automatically and interpreted easily by web publishers.
			P5P provides an opt-in mechanism for a user to convey their 
			potentially intricate personal preferences to a publisher website. 
			The protocol defines a large set of tokens that the user may express 
			that they wish the web publisher to respect. P5P-compatible 
			sites will be notified of the user's personal preferences, and may 
			automate their behavior based on these preferences as appropriate. 
			Thus, each individual server need not query the user for preferences 
			manually at each visit and may instead automatically determine the 
			user's preferences. The user may change their mind at any time and 
			adjust preferences in a single location.Although P5P 
			provides a technical mechanism for enabling websites to be aware of 
			their visitors' preferences, there is of course no technical means 
			by which a web client can enforce or verify that the server actually 
			respects the preferences expressed by the client. Therefore, the use 
			of the standard "pretty please" syntax helps ensure that the web 
			publisher understands that the users' preferences are strongly held 
			and they should feel very badly if those preferences are not 
			respected. TerminologyThe keywords MUST, MUST NOT, 
			REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, 
			and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this document, are to be 
			interpreted as described in RFC2119 [0].Status of this 
			DocumentThis document is expected to progress according to the 
			process described in RFC 1438 [1].Determining the User's P5P 
			PreferencesIn the P5P System, the user's browser expresses their 
			preferences using the P5P HTTP Request header. Naturally, 
			adding hundreds of P5P tokens to outbound requests would negatively 
			impact browsers' investments in network performance [7]. Therefore, 
			the P5P request header may contain either a short list of compact 
			P5P tokens, or may contain a reference URL that points to a policy 
			the user has created or has selected from a gallery of such policies 
			authored by experts. It is expected that privacy wonks and other 
			special interest communities will publish "reference" statements 
			that users may select from.Example #1:P5P: NO-TRACK, 
			PINKY-SWEAR...specifies that the server should not track the 
			user. The PINKY-SWEAR token is described in the Policy Tokens 
			section below.Example #2:P5P: 
			http://example.com/I-Love-Kittens.p5p...specifies that the 
			server should download and parse the specified P5P document from the 
			provided URL. The P5P statement at this location contains 
			preferences of interest to cat lovers; see Policy Tokens below.
			If the web server receives multiple P5P statements, it SHOULD 
			construct the user's preferences as the union of the statements. In 
			the event of flat-out contradictions in the user's preferences, the 
			server MAY refuse to return a response and provide a HTTP/406 Not 
			Acceptable response indicating that the server entity cannot satisfy 
			the client's request conditions.Policy TokensTokens 
			consist of a simple case-insensitive sequence of ASCII characters 
			from the set ['-', 'A'-'z']. Tokens that require a value will follow 
			the token with a single equal sign and a quoted value string. If a 
			token value is omitted, the implicit default value of "true" MUST be 
			assumed.Offering a rich set of policy tokens is critical to 
			the success of the P5P specification. This version of the 
			specification introduces a core set of preference tokens that the 
			user may specify, but it is expected that future versions of this 
			specification will include additional tokens as the need for such 
			tokens is expressed by users. As you can imagine, there are many 
			pieces of valuable metadata that the user may share. We expect 
			several large social networking sites will be eager to participate 
			in this system and will offer to auto-generate P5P declarations 
			based on the private information they have aggregated over their 
			user's thousands of actions.The tokens defined in this 
			version of the specification are as follows:NO-TRACKThe 
			client does not wish to be tracked. The server SHOULD interpret this 
			token in the same manner as the Do-Not-Track header (DNT: 1). 
			Servers MUST immediately discontinue the use of RFC3751 OP [20] 
			if this directive is specified by the client.
			OSTRICH-MODE-PRIVACYThe client indicates that tracking is 
			acceptable, but only if they can see the tracker. Servers MAY track 
			the user using visible content and MUST NOT track the user using any 
			invisible tracking pixels, tracking JavaScript, reverse-IP-tracking, 
			or any backend process.NO-EVILThe client does not want 
			the server to do anything evil in response to the HTTP request. The 
			scope of "evil" may vary by user and hence clients SHOULD attempt to 
			provide more specific directives as well. The server SHOULD attempt 
			to do as little evil as is required to service the user's request.
			Note: The server MUST NOT return any response to the client if 
			the generation of that response involves any TCP/IP connection with 
			the RFC3514 evil bit set [10].NO-PHISHThe NO-PHISH 
			directive indicates that the client would prefer not to see any 
			socially engineered content soliciting the user's credentials or 
			other personal information. This mechanism is considerably simpler 
			and less expensive than building a real-time reputation service [8] 
			and thus can be used by any browser. Note: Do not confuse 
			with NO-FISH.NO-FISHThe NO-FISH directive indicates that 
			the client would prefer not to view any more hardware accelerated 
			demos involving swimming beta-fish, e.g. [9]. Web publishers may 
			respond by instead showing another animal or by presenting the user 
			with a survey inquiring as to how the user developed animosity 
			toward aquatic life.Note: Do not confuse with NO-PHISH.
			NO-POPUPSIndicates that the user would prefer not to receive 
			any form of popup window, no matter what wonderful and unique 
			opportunity is offered in such a window. Note: Early field 
			data suggests that this preference is universally held.
			NO-ADS-IM-SURE-YOU-WILL-FIGURE-OUT-ANOTHER-BUSINESS-MODEL
			Indicates that the user does not wish to be shown any form of 
			advertising content, and expresses their earnest belief that the web 
			publisher will find some way to remain in business without an income 
			stream.Note: This preference appears to be far more common 
			than the related NO-ADS-HERE-IS-MY-BILLING-INFO-INSTEAD value.
			NO-CELEBRITY-GOSSIPIndicates that the user is not a fan of 
			celebrity gossip and thus servers SHOULD refrain from serving 
			content in this theme.Note: Clients sending this token may 
			find that many "news" sites appear to be blank.
			SERVE-ME-ADS-BASED-ON-MY-SELF-IMAGE-RATHER-THAN-MY-BEHAVIOR
			Indicates that the web publisher should select relevant advertising 
			based on the user's self-expressed image (contained elsewhere in the 
			P5P declaration) rather than based on analysis of the user's 
			behavior on the web.For instance, if the user combines this 
			preference with the NO-CELEBRITY-GOSSIP preference, they should not 
			be served advertisements associated with celebrities, even after 
			issuing hourly search queries for "brangelina".MOOD=value
			Expresses the user's current mood, utilizing the values defined in 
			RFC5841 [22]. The server SHOULD react in a sympathetic way 
			and may infer other P5P directives in response to the specified 
			mood.As mood is often ephemeral and not stable over long 
			periods of time, client software SHOULD make configuration of this 
			flag simple and MAY infer it from observations of the user. 
			CAT-PERSONIndicates that the user is a "Cat person" and site 
			themes and stories should be adjusted accordingly.DOG-PERSON
			Indicates that the user is a "Dog person" and site themes and 
			stories should be adjusted accordingly.IS-A-DOGIndicates 
			that the user is actually a canine. This token satisfies a 
			longstanding limitation of the Internet [11].Note: An 
			optional value token allows specification of the visitor's breed; if 
			missing, the default value "mutt" is assumed.
			USER-MIME-TYPE=valueProvides attributes describing the user's 
			physical traits in the format specified by RFC1437 [17].
			SORRY-I-AM-BROKE-RIGHT-NOWThe user expresses that they currently 
			lack funds and appeals for donations or other financing cannot be 
			accommodated at this time. Internet Merchants MAY elect to 
			offer special "zero-down financing" offers. Advertisers SHOULD avoid 
			advertising luxury items to clients that send this preference as 
			these may be offensive to the user.SIGN=valueIndicates 
			the user's astrological sign. This information may prove very useful 
			in allowing sites to tailor their content to the user's temperament 
			and outlook on life. Web publishers MAY correlate this information 
			with a 3rd-party service to further tailor their content based on 
			the visitor's latest horoscope information.
			FAVORITE-COLOR=valueThe client expresses their favorite color 
			using a HTML color string; the website SHOULD react by coloring as 
			many UI elements as possible using colors that match or complement 
			the specified color. Websites SHOULD support a 
			comma-delimited sequence of color tokens for those users who just 
			can't settle on one favorite.AGE=valueThe user expresses 
			their age as an integer, or a string containing a fraction.
			Note: The fractional format is particularly popular for those under 
			age 12. "Ten and three quarters" conveys important additional status 
			amongst the user's peer group.ACTUALAGE=valueThe user 
			expresses their *true* age accurately as an integer. Note: 
			Field research suggests that as ACTUALAGE is lower than AGE until 
			the ACTUALAGE value reaches 21. Often AGE=ACTUALAGE from 21-28, then 
			AGE remains relatively constant despite increasing ACTUALAGE.
			DONT-TELL-MOMThe user expresses that they would like the 
			server to help them avoid any sequence of events that would result 
			in their mother becoming aware of their web traffic.Note: 
			This token appears to be popular even when ACTUALAGE exceeds the age 
			of majority for a given locale.I-AM-SCHMIDTIndicates 
			that user is willing for the web publisher to track and share their 
			behavior with any other party. The user is thus indicating that they 
			would never be doing anything that they wouldn't want everyone to 
			know about [27].DO-NOT-SUEIndicates that the client 
			would prefer that the server fail to return a response if the 
			receipt of the response would put the client in legal jeopardy (e.g. 
			due to intellectual property concerns).DO-NOT-CENSOR
			Indicates that the client should be exempted from all forms of 
			censorship. Web publishers MAY ignore this preference if the client 
			expresses an IS-A-MINOR value which indicates that the user has not 
			reached the age of majority.Note that intermediaries SHOULD 
			leave this token intact in the client's request and SHOULD NOT 
			otherwise interfere with the request or response. It is hoped that 
			the Pretty Please token is sufficient to indicate to any 
			intermediaries that the client bears no nefarious intent.
			I-OWN-MY-WORDSWith this token, the user asserts ownership of the 
			content they have submitted to the server, specifically prohibiting 
			its reuse for any other purpose. Servers may implement this 
			preference using [24] as it is expected that this mechanism will 
			provide an equivalent level of protection.FOSS-ONLYThe 
			user expresses that they are only willing to accept responses 
			generated purely via Free and Open Source hardware and software 
			stacks. Servers, routers and gateways SHOULD not satisfy any request 
			if any proprietary hardware or software is needed to generate a 
			response.NO-SHINYThe user expresses that they are 
			unwilling to accept responses that are built upon Rich Internet 
			Application frameworks like Adobe Flash.Note: This 
			preference is sometimes indicated by users but is more commonly 
			imposed due to hardware lock-in limitations enforced by certain 
			vendors.OPEN-CONTENT-ONLYThe user expresses that they 
			are only willing to view content which is freely available via a 
			suitable Creative Commons license. If no such content is available, 
			the server SHOULD NOT return anything. The server MAY instead return 
			content unrelated to the user's request that satisfies the user's 
			license demands.GEEZ-I-AM-AT-WORKThe user expresses that 
			they are at work and only wish to view content which is appropriate 
			for that environment. All NSFW content should be suppressed 
			by the web publisher.Note: This may result in many web pages 
			appearing completely blank.
			YOUTUBE-YOU-MAY-THINK-YOU-ARE-FUNNY-BUT-YOU-ARE-NOTSuggests that 
			a popular video sharing site stop generating a phony context menu 
			that overrides the default Save Video option in their HTML5 video 
			player [28] such that user is "rick-rolled" into watching a Rick 
			Astley music video [29].INTERNETISSERIOUSBUSINESS
			Indicates that the user believes that the Internet should be used 
			for serious business and tomfoolery should be limited. In 
			particular, users sending this token should not be served novelty 
			RFCs published on the first day of the fourth month or similarly 
			silly content.ICANHAZCHEEZBURGERNon-intuitively, 
			indicates that the user wishes to be shown pictures of cats arranged 
			in unlikely circumstances. Ideally, images should contain mildly 
			amusing captions and be suitable for sharing with others.
			ICANHAZCATNon-intuitively, indicates that the user wishes to be 
			shown pictures of ground beef products arranged in unlikely 
			circumstances. Ideally, images should contain mildly amusing 
			captions and be suitable for sharing with others.NO-MEMES
			Indicates that the user is not a follower of Internet-spread memes 
			and thus would prefer not to read content with oblique references to 
			such memes. Servers SHOULD avoid referencing memes as they won't 
			make any sense to the user and MAY lead to confusion or other 
			unhappy feelings. NO-MIMESIndicates that the user would 
			prefer to avoid images or video content of mimes, feeling that such 
			performers are "just creepy." Servers SHOULD avoid displaying any 
			mimes to avoid giving the user nightmares.Note: This token 
			has nothing to do with Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions [31].
			IS-A-MINOR=valueA "true" value indicates that the user has 
			not attained the age of majority within their locale and thus is not 
			yet an adult. A "false" value indicates that the user has reached 
			the age of majority and thus may be shown adult content. 
			Note: The GEEZ-I-AM-AT-WORK token, if present, should be respected 
			even if IS-A-MINOR="false".Note: Do not confuse with the 
			unrelated IS-A-MINER token.IS-A-MINERIndicates that the 
			user is charged with extracting elements of value from subterranean 
			locales, typically using a shovel or pick. Websites MAY wish 
			to react to this token by utilizing a darker color palette to avoid 
			causing undue stress for the often light-sensitive eyes of visitors 
			in this line of work.Note: Do not confuse with the unrelated 
			IS-A-MINOR token. Most children prefer bright shiny things.
			NOT-PUNNYIndicates that the user has recognized puns are the 
			lowest form of wit, and are typically only deemed funny by their 
			authors.Websites SHOULD limit their use of puns and other 
			wordplay when this token is expressed by the user.SSN=value
			A United States-based user may use this token to provide their 
			Social Security Number.When sending this token, clients 
			SHOULD also send the NO-EVIL token to ensure that nothing bad 
			happens.DONT-TASE-ME-BROThe user expresses the desire to 
			avoid any form of physical violence, and specifically suggests that 
			electric darts would not be welcomed [26].COFFEE=value
			Describes the user's coffee preferences, valid tokens include "hot", 
			"decaf", "blank", "milk", and "iced". Note: servers SHOULD 
			support "decaf" even if the underlying implementation is dependent 
			upon RFC2324 [18]Note: this syntax is insufficiently 
			expressive for patrons of Starbucks. For expressing the 87,000 
			possible configurations of Starbucks coffee, the client MAY provide 
			a base64 encoded byte array, compressed with DEFLATE [30].
			I-AM-COMFORTABLE-WITH-MY-WEIGHT-THANK-YOUThe user requests that 
			the web publisher avoid showing weight-loss advertisements, 
			especially those which attempt to incite self-consciousness on the 
			part of the user.DO-NOT-CRASHThe user requests that the 
			website avoid crashing for the duration of the request. Web 
			publishers should see RFC748 [12] for help in converting this 
			directive into protocol level preferences that will help satisfy the 
			request. The routing mechanisms defined in RFC1217 [23] are 
			generally not suitable for satisfying requests bearing this 
			preference.I-WEAR-A-TINFOIL-HATThe user expresses that 
			they are especially concerned about information leakage and external 
			interference with their personal thought processes.Web 
			publishers should see RFC1097 [13] for help in converting this 
			directive into protocol level preferences that will help avoid 
			inadvertent subliminal messaging.I-AM-JUST-IMPATIENTThis 
			token indicates that the user is inclined toward impatience and may 
			frequently refresh the page due to the eagerness to receive new 
			content.Servers SHOULD NOT interpret unnaturally frequent 
			requests bearing this token as a Denial-of-Service attack.
			Note: In the wild, this token is rarely correlated with the 
			COFFEE="decaf" token. If both tokens are present, servers MAY 
			conclude that the request is malicious.
			GO-FASTER-I-AM-IN-A-HURRYThe user expresses that they are under 
			a time constraint and the operation should be completed as quickly 
			as possible. Web publishers should avoid any process which 
			relies upon RFC1149 [14] or RFC2549 [15] in satisfying this request 
			as these implementations are unlikely to meet the performance 
			requirements implied by this directive. ULS technology [16] should 
			be avoided in servicing requests with this token, particularly if 
			the website is communicating any non-positive news. SFSS [21] may 
			only be used if the endpoints are particularly talented and can 
			maintain sustained throughput of 300spm; compression is highly 
			recommended. NO-RABBLEThe user expresses that their time 
			is valuable and they have no desire to read remarks from anonymous 
			internet users unless those remarks have been deemed exceptionally 
			insightful. Note, this preference is generally incompatible 
			with content generated under RFC2795 [19] and similar processes in 
			use on most Internet sites.PINKY-SWEARIf this token is 
			present, the client asserts that it is providing only truthful 
			information in the provided P5P statement. For instance, an 
			expressed AGE value MUST equal ACTUALAGE.Further the client 
			demands that the server also be an honest dealer and the server MUST 
			accommodate all of the client's preferences or it MUST return a 
			HTTP/406 response.ConclusionContrary to common belief, 
			there is no inherent conflict between the goals and desires of web 
			users and web publishers, content providers, tracking firms, and 
			advertisers. Instead, the only missing piece has been a 
			mechanism whereby the user can clearly and unambiguously state their 
			preferences. P5P provides that mechanism. Websites can now easily 
			learn their users' preferences and if their default practices and 
			goals are in conflict with a given visitor's preferences, they may 
			easily adjust their practice to accommodate their valued guests.
			Appendix 1: Relationship to other specificationsP3P
			The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) specification [2] 
			provides a mechanism by which a given web publisher may advertise a 
			legally-binding statement of their privacy practices. 
			Browsers may interpret the P3P tokens and restrict [3] the 
			functionality of mechanisms useful for tracking the user if the web 
			publisher advertises practices that are offensive to the user's 
			sensibilities.Unfortunately, in the face of such automated 
			enforcement, some popular websites [4] express P3P declarations 
			using technically legal but semantically meaningless policy 
			statements. For example: P3P: CP="If we told you what we do 
			with these cookies, your browser would block them automatically, so 
			we will not."As the P3P specification suggests that browsers 
			should ignore unknown tokens, the previous statement is technically 
			a valid statement with undefined meaning.The same is true 
			for the following P3P declaration based upon an undocumented Jedi 
			mind trick:P3P: CP="This is not a P3P policy! See 
			http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=151657 
			for more info." It is inelegantly left to the courts to 
			decide whether such statements constitute falsehood by omission, in 
			the same vein as a child who, when asked to enumerate what he ate at 
			his friend's house, mentions the carrots but fails to mention the 
			quart of ice cream.P5P resolves the untrustworthy publisher 
			problem by saying "Pretty Please." Even small children know that a 
			request expressed with the "Pretty Please" token is much more likely 
			to be accommodated than one that lacks this important token. 
			Do-Not-TrackThe "Do-Not-Track" specification [25] enables a 
			web user to communicate to the web server that tracking is not 
			desired. The exact mechanism used for this communication is a HTTP 
			Request header of the following form:DNT: 1Unlike 
			P5P, the Do-Not-Track header does not include any "Pretty Please" 
			tokens and thus is somewhat rude.Advertisers have expressed 
			the concern that the Do-Not-Track header is "like sending a smoke 
			signal in the middle of Manhattan; it might draw a lot of attention, 
			but no one knows how to read the message" [5]. P5P helps resolve 
			this ambiguity by providing a rich set of policy tokens that enable 
			the web site to understand the specific details of the user's 
			preferences.Web Tracking ProtectionThe Web Tracking 
			Protection specification [6] describes a feature that allows a 
			browser user to select one or more Tracking Protection Lists (TPLs) 
			or generate their own. Each TPL expresses a set of policies as to 
			which web addresses the browser may contact in a 3rd party context. 
			A TPL effectively acts as a "Do-not-call" list for browser users who 
			do not wish to send information to web publishers who may 
			potentially track them.One popular browser implementation 
			uses the presence of one or more configured TPLs as a signal that it 
			should also send the DNT: 1 header to indicate the implied user 
			preference that they do not wish to be tracked.Because Web 
			Tracking Protection enables privacy using technical means rather 
			than relying upon the goodwill of web tracking companies, it does 
			not give the web tracking companies the opportunity to interpret the 
			user's potentially rich set of personal preferences and react 
			accordingly. As Web Tracking Protection is technically 
			enforced by client browser software, the web publisher and web 
			tracking companies may find it difficult to successfully offer a 
			TPL-protected web user "valuable offers" and "unique opportunities".
			In addition, because TPLs can prevent a tracking or analytics 
			company from accumulating, analyzing, and developing a per-user 
			profile that can be sold to web publishers around the web, users may 
			see less relevant offers and opportunities. P5P mitigates this 
			problem by enabling a P5P user to express a rich set of information 
			about their personal interests and preferences. Appendix 2: 
			International ImplicationsThe World Wide Web is an international 
			network that spans the world and thus can be subject to different 
			legal and regulatory requirements in every locale. Privacy 
			mechanisms which depend upon a specific regulatory framework can 
			often be circumvented by placing a node within a more lax regulatory 
			locale. In contrast, the P5P mechanism does not depend on 
			legal or regulatory frameworks and instead operates based on the 
			universally-recognized value that humans bestow upon politeness.
