      <title>Access Linux filesystems in Windows and WSL 2 | Windows Command Line</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/access-linux-filesystems-in-windows-and-wsl-2/</link>
      <description>Starting with Windows Insiders preview build 20211, WSL 2 will be offering a new feature: wsl --mount. This new parameter allows a physical disk to be attached and mounted inside WSL 2, which enables you to access filesystems that aren’t natively supported by Windows (such as ext4).</description>

      <title>Why it is Important that Software Projects Fail</title>
      <link>https://www.berglas.org/Articles/ImportantThatSoftwareFails/ImportantThatSoftwareFails.html</link>
      <description>Some put this down to organizational culture.  If an engineer were
to deliberately under specify a load bearing beam in order to cut
costs, they would be sent to jail.  But when a programmer cuts a
corner they get promoted.  Others suggest that the problem
domains are fundamentally different.  But all commentators
assume that failure is detrimental to society.  This paper sets out to
correct that misunderstanding.</description>

      <title>Settings Sync for Visual Studio Code</title>
      <link>https://www.jasongaylord.com/blog/2020/09/09/vscode-settings-sync</link>
      <description>For the longest time, if you wanted to sync settings across Visual Studio Code instances, you’d need to use Shan Khan’s extension Settings Sync. That was essentially your only option. In fact, that extension has had nearly 2 million installs to date! There’s still a great benefit to using the extension. For one, you could backup the settings to GitHub and compare versions of the settings. However, if you’re looking for a native implementation, the Visual Studio Code team now has one.</description>

      <title>Why is there a normal galaxy sitting at the edge of the Universe?</title>
      <link>https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/why-is-there-a-normal-galaxy-sitting-at-the-edge-of-the-universe</link>
      <description>Aided by a trick of gravity, astronomers have found a normal galaxy. Big deal, right? The thing is, where they found it is not normal: The light we see from it left the galaxy 12.4 billion years ago, meaning we’re seeing it as it was when the Universe itself was only 1.4 billion years old! That’s what makes this so weird. A normal galaxy has no business being there when the cosmos was so young. But yet, there it sits.</description>

      <title>Learn C# with CSharpFritz - Ep 3:  C# Methods, Events, and Delegates for Beginners</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E2xB4kOSV0</link>
      <description>This is episode 3 of C# with CSharpFritz and Jeff walks through methods, events, and delegates in this beginner-friendly episode.

Interactive Notebook with samples you can run IN BROWSER at:  https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/main

After the C# basics sessions are completed, which user interface framework do you want Fritz to walk through FIRST?  Vote for your favorite with an emote at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/issues/13

Questions:
25:51 - Is it considered bad practice to use a nested class?
39:20 - When writing methods, is it a rule that they do one thing and one thing only?
42:15 - How do you create a method with a 'real' optional value?
44:28 - Can I write a reusable method to do that, so that all of my API calls can reuse that method?
51:49 - What's a good rule on the number of out parameters vs returning an object with those values instead?
1:00:33 - Is ref used with value types to change their value within the method?
1:06:02 - What happens when you assign a new instance of a class to a parameter inside of a method?
1:12:00 - Are delegates the same as a callback function?
1:14:40 - If data types are not specified when assigning a delegate, would it automatically infer the type?
1:25:48 - Can a list of delegates be executed?
1:30:46 - Is it possible to use a non-void-return-type delegate as the type for an event, and then process the subscriber list with GetInvocationList()?
1:47:30 - What's the difference between abstract classes and partial classes?

      <description>Written and Performed by Forrest Brazeal.

Full Lyrics:
There's MQ, EC2,
And RedShift and GameLift and Glue.
There's Lumberyard, Lightsail and Workdocs and Workmail, with Worklink and PrivateLink too.
Detective, Inspector, and Trusted Advisor, Cognito, Corretto, S3 -
Data Pipeline and DataSync, AppMesh and AppSync, 
or you can use SimpleDB. But don't!
Appstream, Timestream, Augmented AI, Auto Scaling, Lambda, Amplify.
Ohh, DirectConnect or just Connect, Config and RDS -
These are the major services of AWS.
CLI, CDK, Textract, Lex, FSx and XRay.
SNS, STS, SQS, SES, EFS, do your best, it's okay.
There's Athena and Polly and Kendra and Macie. Alexa for Business, Cloud 9 --
And there's CodeBuild and CodeDeploy, CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeGuru, CodeStar, and Chatbot and Chime.

Translate, Transcribe, Transfer Family -
All the many Things of IoT.
Ohhh there's CloudFormation, Lake Formation, Free RTOS - 
These are the major services of AWS.
Honeycode. Elemental. VMWare on AWS.
(This key change is brought to you by ... )
Comprehen-duh, Inferentia, Deep Learning, DeepRacer, DeepLens-uh
DeepComposer, Aurora, and old Cost Explorer to track your expanding expense-uh.
Service Catalog, Artifact, Quicksight, Device Farm and Workspaces, Glacier is cold,
RoboMaker, Sumerian, Kafka, Kinesis, Control Tower, Pinpoint, and Fargate, I'm told.

Rekognition, Fraud Detector's cool, Wavelength, Blockchain, Well-Architected Tool.
Though half of 'em start with "Amazon", for reasons we can't guess..
These are the major services of AWS.
Now it's time for Global Accelerator!!
VPC, ELB, And the database Route53.
Plus Compute Optimizer and Personalize or EventBridge and QLDB.
There's CloudSearch and CloudWatch and CloudMap and CloudFront and CloudTrail and CloudHSM 
And there's Sagemaker, Step Functions, WAF, ACM, ECR, EMR, SAR, IAM -
Then there's Outposts and OpsWorks and Organizations and Snow, SSO, and AppFlow and Ground Station and DynamoDB and DocumentDB, and Neptune and Keyspaces, Shield and GuardDuty
There's the Managers and the Elastics and the Dashboards and the Hubs, I'm cheating now, we gotta wrap this up!
Greengrass, Forecast, tools and SDKs, Storage, Transit and API Gateways,
Yeah, there's Braket and Budgets and Backup and Batch, ECS, EKS, EBS -

For all intents and purposes, 
These are the major services
(Til re:Invent throws us a curve, that is)
Of AWS.</description>
