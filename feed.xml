      <title>Gemini CLI's Polarizing Release on Hacker News – A Visual Analysis</title>
      <link>https://kian.prose.sh/hackernews_discussion_gemini_cli_release</link>
      <description>Gemini released a new developer oriented CLI tool. This tool has a relatively generous free tier of 60 requests per minute, 1000 requests per day. When large language models (LLMs) were initially released, there was a lot of fear that it would automate many white collar jobs: however, their unreliability and risk for off-the-rails behavior in tasks without easy verification or ground truths. Developer oriented tooling seems to be a better fit for a productivity tool that depends on validation.</description>

      <title>Daniel's Blog · Agent Lineage Evolution: A Novel Framework for Managing LLM Agent Degradation</title>
      <link>https://danieltan.weblog.lol/2025/06/agent-lineage-evolution-a-novel-framework-for-managing-llm-agent-degradation</link>
      <description>Agent Lineage Evolution (ALE) is a novel framework that addresses the dual challenge of LLM agent degradation and manual prompt engineering bottlenecks. As LLMs inevitably degrade over extended usage, requiring frequent context restarts, current approaches force humans to manually re-engineer prompts with learned optimizations for each restart. ALE eliminates this scaling limitation by enabling agents to automatically generate successor prompts with embedded behavioral knowledge, transforming inevitable degradation cycles into opportunities for automated prompt evolution.</description>

      <description>A manifesto for simple computing. While other fields embraced minimalism, tech became bloated. Why do we use complex, oversized systems for simple jobs? It's like taking a semi-truck to buy salad. This post explores a return to efficient, low-cost, and minimalist computing.</description>

      <title>Why every developer should have a side project: My 10-year journey of failings</title>
      <link>https://bohdanl.com/blog/side-projects-personal-learning</link>
      <description>In this article, I share my personal journey with side projects: my failures and successes for the past 10 years. I talk about how working on side projects pushed me to learn new skills and has helped me grow beyond coding, as well as showcase my many attempts to build a business. You will learn how to find ideas, approach development and manage time, deal with burnout, and learn from my mistakes.In the end of the article, I also showcase my latest side project betterlingo.app and talk why I decided to build another project after a big break. I hope my experiences and advice will help you on your own path.</description>

      <title>Folklore.org: -2000 Lines Of Code</title>
      <link>https://www.folklore.org/Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.html</link>
      <description>In early 1982, the Lisa software team was trying to buckle down for the big push to ship the software within the next six months.  Some of the managers decided that it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual engineer in terms of the amount of code that they wrote from week to week.  They devised a form that each engineer was required to submit every Friday, which included a field for the number of lines of code that were written that week.</description>
