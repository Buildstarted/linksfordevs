      <title>Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10984</link>
      <description>We introduce systematic tests exploiting robust statistical and behavioral
patterns in trading to detect fake transactions on 29 cryptocurrency exchanges.
Regulated exchanges feature patterns consistently observed in financial markets
and nature; abnormal first-significant-digit distributions, size rounding, and
transaction tail distributions on unregulated exchanges reveal rampant
manipulations unlikely driven by strategy or exchange heterogeneity. We
quantify the wash trading on each unregulated exchange, which averaged over 70%
of the reported volume. We further document how these fabricated volumes
(trillions of dollars annually) improve exchange ranking, temporarily distort
prices, and relate to exchange characteristics (e.g., age and userbase), market
conditions, and regulation.</description>

      <title>80386DX ISA SINGLE BOARD MICROCOMPUTER</title>
      <link>https://alexandrugroza.ro/microelectronics/system-design/isa-80386dx-sbmc/index.html</link>
      <description>Living in the early 1990s along with the technological advancements in computing and microelectronics was a rewarding experience. While I initially had little access to the latest technologies, everything shifted with the beginning of the decade. By chance I had the opportunity to own a very high performance computer for the time being. It was an 80386SX CPU-based machine running at 25 MHz. Further equipment included 2 Mb RAM, integrated AcuMOS AVGA2 card with 256 K graphics memory, and a 40 Mb Seagate hard disk drive. All packed in a Kenitec branded desktop case and connected to a 12&amp;quot; AOC monochrome VGA monitor. I discovered modern operating systems, games, and -- drum roll, please -- computer programming. This is the context that marked my life in terms of computers. It changed it completely, shifting my perspective to 180 degrees.</description>

      <description>I’m happy to publish the fourth issue of the “OCaml compiler development newsletter”.

If you have been working on the OCaml compiler and want to say something, please feel free to post in this thread! If you would like me to get in touch next time I prepare a newsletter issue (some random point in the future), please let me know by emai...</description>

      <title>Sociotechnical Lenses into Software Systems</title>
      <link>https://paulosman.me/2021/10/02/sociotechnical-lenses-into-software-systems/</link>
      <description>Software systems are sociotechnical. I don’t think software professionals spend enough time discussing the challenges that span software and personal aspects. When we look at software through a sociotechnical lens, we begin to appreciate the complexity inherent in software development and operations. The systems we are building and operating are constantly being modified by different people, with different contexts, at different times, who may or may not speak to each other directly.</description>

      <title>Potential Improvements to Spaced Repetition | David Bieber</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-11-02-improvements-to-spaced-repetition/</link>
      <description>Spaced repetition is not super widespread. It’s popular among med school students and language learners, but frequently people find the benefits outweighed by the costs, the friction too high, and they stop.
I believe the following are the most pressing issues to solve for spaced repetition to allow for wider adoption:
 Card creation: Zero friction card creation Card creation: Good cards by default Card maintenance: Eject bad cards quickly Schedule flexibility: Allow people to study more Schedule flexibility: Allow people to study less Review friction: Bring the reviews to the users  If we solve these six issues, I think that could open up spaced repetition to a much wider audience.</description>

      <title>How I created a Markdown parser</title>
      <link>https://bien.ee/blog/how-i-created-a-markdown-parser</link>
      <description>Let me begin this post by saying that I&amp;#39;m no genius, and I&amp;#39;ve peeked under the hood of a few other Markdown parsers, all of which with complexity that leaves me quite stunned. So when I set out to create my very own Markdown parser, I knew I had to figure out a simpler approach, and I think I did, even if it doesn&amp;#39;t include a full feature-set of a mainstream Markdown parser (yet).</description>

      <title>Implementing CHIP-8 in Jack</title>
      <link>https://abhaynayar.com/blog/chip8-in-jack.html</link>
      <description>In this post, I will go over how I implemented a CHIP-8 emulator using the
Jack language (from the
nand2tetris course). I thought this would be a fun project since I would be
programming an emulator that would run under another emulator that I had
previously programmed.</description>
