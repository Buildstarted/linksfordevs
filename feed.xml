      <title>Conditionally setting your gitconfig</title>
      <link>https://utf9k.net/blog/conditional-gitconfig/</link>
      <description>Personally, I try to keep my development environment as convenient to use as possible and with the advent of BeyondCorp-style zero trust, more internal services are thankfully available without a VPN required.
This makes it easy to access tooling from your mobile device and other places but it can also mean the line between work and personal blurs a little bit.
A lot of my custom work-related configuration has been deprecated (utilities for wrangling VPNs and proxies) and I basically don’t maintain anything more than what was already open sourced.</description>

      <title>C++/WinRT nasty gotcha: winrt::param::hstring constructed from std::wstring_view requires null termination</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210823-00/?p=105598</link>
      <description>The std::string_view (and wide buddy std::wstring_view) represent a contiguous sequence of characters, not necessarily null-terminated. One nasty gotcha in C++/WinRT is that if you try to construct a winrt::hstring from a std::wstring_view, the C++/WinRT library requires that your std::wstring_view be followed with a null terminator.</description>
