      <description>How do you create a sustainable open-source ecosystem? Carl and Richard talk to Sarah Novotny about how the open-source community continues to evolve. Sarah talks about how the vast majority of software utilizes open-source code and should be contributing to those projects. Those contributions can be financial or development resources, whatever makes more sense for the organization. The conversation also explores the nature of those contributions when the project has smaller and larger audiences, is purely </description>

      <title>How Layoffs in Startupland Differ Between B2B &amp;amp; B2C Companies by @ttunguz</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/whats-different-in-this-layoff-cycle/</link>
      <description>The current wave of layoffs, a difficult component of the innovation boom/bust cycle, differs from the previous years’ dynamics.
B2B companies have reduced headcount to a greater extent than at any time since 2020.
In the last three years, B2C startups’ ratio of layoffs have dwarfed B2B layoffs. In 2020, B2C companies cut 8.8x the number of B2B employees. 3.8x in 2021, &amp;amp; 6.9x in 2022.
Year-to-date in 2023, the figure is 1.</description>

      <title>Lucas Kostka - Listening is not what you think</title>
      <link>https://lucaskostka.com/posts/listening</link>
      <description>I tend to feel that people don&amp;#39;t get properly listened at. Everybody&amp;#39;s craving for attention, on social media or just in real life. What so complex about it ? Listening is not hearing, it requires actual efforts. The effort of taking yourself out of the picture. The effort to make some space to welcome otherness. This ain&amp;#39;t easy. Particularly if you do not share obvious interest with the speaker. But most of the times, there are solid benefits: refraining from talking gives you the opportunity to unveil what&amp;#39;s driving people, from their hearts and minds (provided that you show appreciation to what they are sharing with you). And that is pretty cool, as you could discover new areas of interest, valuable insights or better understand arguments supporting ideas you don&amp;#39;t adhere to. But also, you may help someone clearing his soul from dreadful feelings. Because before being able to welcome advices, one often needs to clarify what one needs. And the most straightforward way to do it, for me at least, has always been to talk through it, out loud. Easy! Why can&amp;#39;t I just speak to myself? I also do it from time to time to be honest, mainly when debugging stuff actually, but I feel that I am missing something: talking to someone helps you share the load, because by actively listening, one offers you a space to drop it. Be it for an hour or a minute, laying down your burden helps you appreciate the distance traveled. And that&amp;#39;s all you need sometimes to resume your journey. Advices should only come after in my opinion. By the way, I am definitely not the best at this, everyone can improve &amp;#128522;</description>

      <description>While I was building aihelperbot.com I did what I imagine many developers do: I used an ORM for everything database related. I used ORM to handle migrations, define schemas, insert data, update data, select data, etc. I didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t think much about it.
It was only later while building aihelperbot.com I started to wonder if I really needed an ORM? Using AI more and more I started to realize that I could do most of the things I did with an ORM directly with SQL.</description>

      <description>The WinForms code-behind approach has always made app development in WinForms unrivaled fast. For complex line-of-business apps, however, it can become an architectural challenge. New Command- and Data Binding Features in .NET 7 make UI-Controllers and MVVM an alternative and allow them also be reused in UI stacks like .NET MAUI.</description>
