      <title>Coding Shorts: Dependency Injection Explained
</title>
      <link>https://wildermuth.com/2021/07/05/Coding-Shorts-Dependency-Injection-Explained/</link>
      <description>Like most of you, I&amp;#39;ve been using Dependency Injection in my projects for quite a while. Whether it be the built-in .NET Core Dependency Injection layer, Ninject, StructureMap, Unity, MEF, etc. I&amp;#39;ve been using a DI layer to do this work for many years. But before I understood the benefit, I did so somewhat reluctantly.

      <description>TypeScript 3.7 added support for the ?. operator, also known as the optional chaining operator.

      <description>When researching construction, you invariably discover that any new or innovative idea has actually been tried over and over again, often stretching back decades. One of these new-but-actually-old ideas is the idea of a mechanical bricklayer, a machine to automate the construction of masonry walls.</description>

      <title>An Attempt at Demystifying Graph Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://ericmjl.github.io/essays-on-data-science/machine-learning/graph-nets/</link>
      <description>There are a ton of great explainers of what graph neural networks are.
However, I find that a lot of them go pretty deep into the math pretty quickly.
Yet, we still are faced with that age-old problem: where are all the pics??
As such, just as I had attempted with Bayesian deep learning,
I&amp;#39;d like to try to demystify graph deep learning as well,
using every tool I have at my disposal
to minimize the number of equations and maximize intuition using pictures.
Here&amp;#39;s my attempt, I hope you find it useful!</description>

      <title>The Excel Formula Language Is Now Turing-Complete </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/articles/excel-lambda-turing-complete/</link>
      <description>The Excel team announced LAMBDA, a new feature that lets users define and name formula functions. LAMBDA functions admit parameters, can call other LAMBDA functions and recursively call themselves. 
With LAMBDA, the Excel formula language is Turing-complete: user-defined functions can thus compute anything without resorting to imperative languages (e.g., VBA, JavaScript).</description>
