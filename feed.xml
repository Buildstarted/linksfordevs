      <title>How a Basketball Statistic Changed How I See the World – Daniel Frank</title>
      <link>https://danfrank.ca/how-a-basketball-statistic-changed-how-i-see-the-world/</link>
      <description>Before analytics revolutionized the sport of basketball, many fans would judge the quality of a player by what is referred to as their “box score statistics”; statistics recorded for each game like how many shots a player took, the amount of times they rebounded the ball etc. In simple terms, players who did things that were quantified and showed up on the box-score (ie scoring a lot, getting a lot of blocks) were seen as great players and those with lesser box-score statistics were seen as weaker players.</description>

      <title>It’s Not Better If It’s Also Worse</title>
      <link>https://www.fabisevi.ch/2021/04/08/its-not-better-if-its-also-worse/</link>
      <description>For a long time I’ve told people that I love technology and all it enables, yet dislike the technology industry and working in tech. People often find my statement hard to rectify, probably because they see the two as inextricably linked. Technology is an ever-changing process, one that pushes humanity forward through the application of science, and the industry has become (and arguably always has been) about capitalizing those mechanisms of change.</description>

      <link>https://www.mudgeontherun.com/post/self-propulsion</link>
      <description>Exercise, as a commodity, is in its infancy relative to the timescale of homo sapien existence, gyms and health clubs having formed in the last eyeblink. And for fairly obvious reason, too - never before has caloric abundance existed like it does today, and never before has so little been physically demanded from our species. Nomadism gave way to subsistence farming, which paved the path to permanent settlements. Industrialism, Henry Ford, and the Hershey’s company took care of the rest. What ha</description>

      <description>More and more work involves collaboration. Multiple people working in a team on the same thing that is becoming ever more complex. What does this mean for an organization? Information and knowledge, especially in the technology domain, is becoming a commodity. All the best technical tools to build your next Google is just a Google search away. In the age of digital products, market access is getting cheaper every day. This increases the importance of the team and their effectiveness as it becomes a company’s unique selling point.</description>
