      <description>Since the ancestors of homo sapiens first made tools out of rocks and sticks and grass, society has been transformed by the development of ever more powerful technologies, from stone axes to the steam engine to the GPS satellite. Computers and the internet, the most important technologies of recent decades, are the latest step in this long, long process.</description>

      <title>Hypothetical: Foldy ears as an indicator of intelligence</title>
      <link>https://www.kaiwenwang.me/writing/20240421_ears-are-intelligence</link>
      <description>I’m writing this because I believe it’s better for people to have more access to information than less access to it. People constantly judge others on looks, family background, and wealth and often in a bad way. Making people pay attention to ears doesn’t hurt.</description>

      <title>GenesisOS: Publishing my micro-kernel!</title>
      <link>https://0xbigshaq.github.io/2024/04/22/genesis-os/</link>
      <description>Hello world, and happy Passover ✡️.

After more than a year, I finally decided to publish a tiny side project I’ve been working on.







Link to the project:  / https://github.com/0xbigshaq/GenesisOS

This is a collection of all my tweets/progress over the time whil working on this:

  Day 1: Reading stuff about micro kernels, looking for OSDev enthusiast communities so I can ask and learn more on how to make my first steps.
  Day 17: Kernel allocator
  Day 53: Virtual Memory
  Day 59: Mental Breakdown because of PIC
  Day 63: Interrups, and ranting about Intel specs
  Day 70: Programming 8259A IRQ Chip to read keyboard keystrokes
  Day 86: Started working on a scheduler, almost gave up at this point
  Day 135: Scheduler, round two, I lost again.
  Day 156: Scheduler, round three, it works!
  Day 177: Almost gave up because ATA PIO is annoying
  Day 178: Didn’t gave up! Tried again. Now reading from disk with ATA PIO successfully
  Day 180: Took another break. lost motivation. Wanted to do other things(v8, embedded, etc.)
  Day 234: Planned on coming back but World War III just started (October 7th)
  Day 409: Announcing my return and set a goal - loading an init binary into memory as the first userland process.
  Day 417: FAT32 Driver and userland VM works! init process/shell is loaded successfully.
  Day 418: Learning about some GitHub Actions stuff because I’m bored and I don’t want to develop more syscalls.


There are many other things that are still not ready. Like writing to the disk, networking drivers, basic syscalls like execv/fork, etc. I’m not sure if I have the energy to get into it tho. This is why i’m writing this blogpost: if you want to contribute &amp;amp; make a community out of this silly project, join my discord server and we can try to set something up.

Either way, I’m glad I finally published it and didn’t keep it as another project in my archive. It’s been a nice journey.

      <title>Simple, Underrated Ways to Make the World a More Wonderful Place – Daniel Frank</title>
      <link>https://danfrank.ca/simple-underrated-ways-to-make-the-world-a-more-wonderful-place/</link>
      <description>I know someone who is depressed, and you can tell from what they talk about that they think they offer no value to the world. I always want to share: when you walk down the street, you help make your neighbourhood safer; when you return the grocery cart, you help protect important social norms; when you use public transit, you help fund it—see, you actively help make the world a better place! Of course, I never say that, because that isn’t what this person wants to hear, but I think it’s underrated how much good people do by simple actions.</description>

      <description>“You Do Not Need a Vector Database” is the provocative title of a recent blog post (with code) by Dr. Yucheng Low, co-founder of XetHub. In this post, I’ll explain what a vector database is, why Dr. Low says you don’t need one, and provide context to Dr. Low’s answer.</description>

      <title>The Mandelbrot nature of modularization</title>
      <link>https://chi.pl/2024/04/21/The-Mandelbrot-nature-of-modularization.html</link>
      <description>In the world of software, modularization is crucial for maintaining flexibility, scalability, and code readability. I have participated in many discussions about the ideal size of a module. These discussions often feature extreme opinions, ranging from “it’s better to have a few large modules” to “the smaller the modules, the better”. The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between, and in this post, I will point out how to pinpoint it.</description>

      <description>I’m currently 30 years old. A lot of things start happening around this age range: Sex and the city starts being funny, you start to know what mortgages and Minoxidil are, and your friends start having kids — on purpose(!!!).
And just like having kids, talking about the decision of having kids also becomes a common thing. Don’t get me wrong, the demographic implosion is just as real among my friend group as anywhere else.</description>

      <description>I saw a project a couple weeks back which allows writing and running Crystal
methods inline inside a Ruby file.
It’s a neat project, and I don’t want to take away from it but something in the
README example looked off to me.
