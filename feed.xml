      <description>I don’t think I have to make the point of how important tools are. What would we do without IDEs like Visual Studio? Or without good email clients like Gmail and Outlook? For power users like software engineers, good tools can 10x your productivity. Everyone got their favorite tools, and I think I gathered a pretty good list. So here’s my list of tools that I use every day and highly recommend.</description>

      <title>mjg59 | PSA: upgrade your LUKS key derivation function</title>
      <link>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/66429.html</link>
      <description>Here&amp;#39;s an article from a French anarchist describing how his (encrypted) laptop was seized after he was arrested, and material from the encrypted partition has since been entered as evidence against him. His encryption password was supposedly greater than 20 characters and included a mixture of cases, numbers, and punctuation, so in the absence of any sort of opsec failures this implies that even relatively complex passwords can now be brute forced, and we should be transitioning to even more secure passphrases.</description>

      <title>macOS’ Rapid Security Response: Designed into a Corner</title>

      <description>With macOS 13.3.1 dropping a few weeks ago, some people have been wondering what happened to Apple’s featured “Rapid Security Response” system they showed off back at WWDC 2022? For some reason, Apple keeps shipping their usual slow, bulky security updates as opposed to the new small and “rapid” security updates.</description>

      <title>Generalized Macros</title>
      <link>https://ianthehenry.com/posts/generalized-macros/</link>
      <description>I’ve been writing a lot of Janet lately, and I’ve been especially enjoying my time with the macro system.
Janet macros are Common Lisp-flavored unhygienic gensym-style macros. They are extremely powerful, and very easy to write, but they can be pretty tricky to get right. It’s easy to make mistakes that lead to unwanted variable capture, or to write macros that only work if they’re expanded in particular contexts, and it can be pretty difficult to detect these problems ahead of time.
So people have spent a lot of time thinking about ways to write macros more safely – sometimes at the cost of expressiveness or simplicity – and almost all recent languages use some sort of hygienic macro system that defaults to doing the right thing.
But as far as I know, no one has approached macro systems from the other direction. No one looked at Common Lisp’s macros and said “What if these macros aren’t dangerous enough? What if we could make them even harder to write correctly, in order to marginally increase their power and expressiveness?”
So welcome to my blog post.</description>

      <description>It is very common in the tech industry for companies to have ‘bug-bounty programmes’, which are schemes where companies encourage people who are interested in cybersecurity (i.e., white-hat hackers) to check for vulnerabilities in their products and inform them of any bugs found. The ‘bounty’ is a reward for finding bugs, usually in the form of money or an internship with the company.</description>

      <title>Range Encoding for Data Compression</title>
      <link>https://alecdee.github.io/rangecomp/index.html</link>
      <description>Range encoders are a type of entropy encoder used in modern day data compressors. They&amp;#39;re an
evolution of earlier entropy encoders (most notably Huffman encoding) which were restricted to
encoding data as a whole number of bits. Range encoding, by contrast, allows us to encode in
fractions of a bit and thus achieve compression ratios very close to optimal.</description>
