      <title>Awk in 20 Minutes</title>
      <link>https://ferd.ca/awk-in-20-minutes.html</link>
      <description>Awk is a tiny programming language and a command line tool. It's
particularly appropriate for log parsing on servers, mostly because Awk will
operate on files, usually structured in lines of human-readable text.</description>

      <title>Complexity Has to Live Somewhere</title>
      <link>https://ferd.ca/complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html</link>
      <description>We try to get rid of the complexity, control it, and seek simplicity. I think framing things that way is misguided. Complexity has to live somewhere. Embrace it</description>

      <title>Reducing allocations using Span&lt;T&gt; and Memory&lt;T&gt;</title>
      <link>https://stebet.net/real-world-example-of-reducing-allocations-using-span-t-and-memory-t/</link>
      <description>I decided to look at the RabbitMQ .NET Client source code to make improvements. During that exploration I saw opportunities to reduce memory allocations.</description>

      <title>on the usability of editable software</title>
      <link>https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/on-the-usability-of-editable-software</link>
      <description>I’m aware of two occasions on which Knuth advised editing existing code, as opposed to simply using it. One mention is in this interview, advocating for “re-editable” code instead of the fashionable reusable code, although it doesn’t amount to much more than that statement. In Coders at Work he describes a system of working that’s basically patch and diff. He writes a program, the master version that works for him, and ships it out. People receive and it and then modify it with change files so it works for them.</description>

      <description>Gatsby and Sanity.io are a great pair for creating JAMstack projects like blogs. In these videos, I am working to migrate my Gatsby blog from using markdown files to using the Headless CMS called Sanity.io. After starting this migration, I am loving Gatsby and Sanity.io

      <description>Some users prefer the Office web apps, others prefer the Office desktop apps. We've designed an experience where users get to tell us what they prefer, and then their links open in their preferred mode - either Office web apps or the Office desktop apps.</description>

      <title>OpenPGP Message Format</title>
      <link>https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis-09.html</link>
      <description>{ Work in progress to update the OpenPGP specification from RFC4880 } 
       This document specifies the message formats used in OpenPGP.  OpenPGP
provides encryption with public-key or symmetric cryptographic
algorithms, digital signatures, compression and key management. 
       This document is maintained in order to publish all necessary
information needed to develop interoperable applications based on the
OpenPGP format.  It is not a step-by-step cookbook for writing an
application.  It describes only the format and methods needed to read,
check, generate, and write conforming packets crossing any network.
It does not deal with storage and implementation questions.  It does,
however, discuss implementation issues necessary to avoid security
flaws.</description>
