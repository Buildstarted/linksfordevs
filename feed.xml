Cliff notes:
Cliff advises not to rely on his memory for the volume of a sphere.  It's really 4/3 π r^3.   Cliff also says that using a tube to break the vapor lock is challenging.  Straws (even flexo-straws) kink when bent around narrow hairpin curves.  And most flexible tubes (especiallly aquarium air tubing) have high friction against glass, so they're difficult to thread along the curve.

      <title>Hemolithin: a Meteoritic Protein containing Iron and Lithium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11688</link>
      <description>This paper characterizes the first protein to be discovered in a meteorite.
Amino acid polymers previously observed in Acfer 086 and Allende meteorites
[1,2] have been further characterized in Acfer 086 via high precision MALDI
mass spectrometry to reveal a principal unified structure of molecular weight
2320 Daltons that involves chains of glycine and hydroxy-glycine residues
terminated by iron atoms, with additional oxygen and lithium atoms.
Signal-to-noise ratios up to 135 have allowed the quantification of iron and
lithium in the various MALDI fragments via the isotope satellites due to their
respective minority isotopic masses 54Fe and 6Li. Analysis of the complete
spectrum of isotopes associated with each molecular fragment shows 2H
enhancements above terrestrial averaging 25,700 parts per thousand (sigma =
3,500, n=15), confirming extra-terrestrial origin and hence the existence of
this molecule within the asteroid parent body of the CV3 meteorite class. The
molecule is tipped by an iron-oxygen-iron grouping that in other terrestrial
contexts has been proposed to be capable of absorbing photons and splitting
water into hydroxyl and hydrogen moieties.</description>
