      <description>Did you see the following error in recent days in your build-pipeline:
error NETSDK1194: The &amp;quot;--output&amp;quot; option isn&amp;#39;t supported when building a solution.
If so - that is not necessarily your fault at all! Microsoft released a new SDK version, which breaks your builds. Let&amp;#39;s see why and what we can do to tackle that.

      <title>Two Actually Useful GPT-3.5 Prompts for Zettelkasten Schreibers</title>
      <link>https://www.bramadams.dev/202302181117/</link>
      <description>I have been using two GPT-3.5 prompts to help me save time and improve my writing as a Zettelkasten Schreiber. The Outline to Complete Sentence English Prompt transforms outlines into complete sentence English, while the Summary Generator takes complex text and distills it into a blurb.</description>

      <description>This is kind of open letter I suppose. I’ve seen a lot of similar stuff happen in other projects too, like GNOME. So I wanted to write down what happened to me and my inbox today. It’s written in my perspective, but I’m sure many can sympathize. And I sympathize with them.</description>

      <title>Queues should be empty</title>
      <link>http://joshvoigts.com/articles/queues-should-be-empty/</link>
      <description>I’ve been writing a pubsub listener for work recently and had this silly “shower thought”: the ideal queue should be empty. Why? If the queue is not empty, it means that whatever job is consuming from the queue is not keeping up with messages coming into it. Ok, then if queues are supposed to be empty, then what are they good for?</description>

      <title>Exact cover and applications</title>
      <link>https://louisabraham.github.io/articles/exact-cover</link>
      <description>A few months ago, I bought a set of pentominos because it reminded me of a book I had read as a child: The Wright 3. I solved a few configurations but soon my computer scientist education and my laziness took over and whispered: exact cover. If you are looking for a set cover solver, simply use from malib import exact_cover.</description>

      <description>The Microsoft Authenticator app helps you sign in to your accounts when you&amp;#39;re using two-step verification. Two-step verification helps you to use your accounts more securely because passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised. Two-step verification uses a second step like your phone to make it harder for other people to break in to your account. You can use the Authenticator app in multiple ways:</description>
