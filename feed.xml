      <description>‚ÄúHey can you watch my stuff for a second?‚Äù
‚Äì A person at Starbucks before they go to the bathroom
For game theory reasons, asking one stranger at Starbucks to watch your laptop while you run off to the bathroom is a bad idea. Here‚Äôs what doing so presumes:
 There are people at Starbucks looking for unattended property and hoping to snag it
OR
There are people who aren‚Äôt actively looking for unattended stuff but once they see it, they decide it‚Äôs too good an opportunity to pass up so they take it.</description>
