      <title>The Who Cares Era | dansinker.com</title>
      <link>https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/</link>
      <description>Earlier this week, it was discovered that the Chicago Sun-Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer had both published an externally-produced "special supplement" that contained facts, experts, and book titles entirely made up by an AI chatbot. There's been a lot written about this (former Chicago Reader editor Martha Bayne's is the best), and I don't need to rehash it all. But the thing that is most disheartening to me is how at every step along the way, nobody cared.</description>

      <title>ARK004: Finalizing ARK Component with State, Style &amp; Strategy</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=v6q8z1nr7I4</link>
      <description>ðŸš€ Project ARK â€“ Session 5: Finalizing ARK Component with State, Style &amp; Strategy
In this session, weâ€™re wrapping up the core ARK component â€” and diving deep into what makes a component production-ready.

ðŸ‘‰ Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll cover:
0/ Finalizing and testing the ARK component
1/ Understanding component states and why they matter for great UX
2/ Test-driving styling in a Blazor application using .NET
3/ Exploring launch strategy ideas for getting the app into users' hands

This session connects the dots between functionality, design, and delivery. If you're building serious Blazor apps, this episode is packed with insights you wonâ€™t want to miss.

ðŸ’¡ Like, comment, and subscribe to stay on the journey as we bring Project ARK to life!

      <title>1 Introduction â€“ Log Gaussian Cox Processes and INLA: Theory and Application</title>
      <link>https://saverymax.github.io/log-gaussian-cox-process-intro/intro.html</link>
      <description>This is a blog post about Log-Gaussian Cox Processes (LGCP), mainly. It is a follow up to the earlier blog post I made about Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) models. In fact, the LGCP is an extension of the NHPP, in that a latent correlation structure is included in the point process model. Specifically, the LGCP uses a Gaussian Random Field to characterize the intensity of the point process. Doing so allows us to take into account spatial or temporal correlation across our region or period of interest. Statistically, this is quite advantageous compared to the NHPP where spatial correlation could only be accounted for via covariates. Not including such correlation structure means that you then assume the covariates included in your model are sufficient to account for spatial fluctuations in the response variable. However, the inclusion of the random field presents mathematical and computational challenges.</description>

      <title>My Wildly Incorrect Bias About Corporate Engineers</title>
      <link>https://inessential.com/2025/05/23/love_letter.html</link>
      <description>Before I went to work for Audible (five years ago now â€”Â time flies!) I had a bias about engineers that worked for large corporations. I assumed that they werenâ€™t as good as indies and engineers at small companies, or else theyâ€™d actually be indies or work at small shops like Omni.</description>
