      <title>I&amp;#39;ll read it – Manu</title>
      <link>https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it</link>
      <description>&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what to write about&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;what if no one will read it?&amp;quot;. These are the two most common reasons why people don&amp;#39;t want to start a personal blog. I already addressed the first one, so let me tackle the second one in the easiest way possible: I&amp;#39;ll read it. If you decide to start a blog in either English or Italian, I&amp;#39;ll read it. I don&amp;#39;t care about the topic. Start a blog, write something, send it to me, and I&amp;#39;ll read it. And you&amp;#39;ll have your first reader. If you add an RSS feed to your blog, I&amp;#39;ll add you to my reading list, and I&amp;#39;ll keep reading what you post. As soon as a bunch of you have blogs, I&amp;#39;ll compile a list and make it available on this site. Hopefully, more people will read what you write. But I promise you that if you start writing, you&amp;#39;ll have a reader.</description>

      <title>Do multi-gaming apps make sense?</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2023/04/09/multi-vs-single-gaming.html</link>
      <description>I’ve been thinking about multi-gaming platforms due to their recent meteoric rise to capture about 10% of the RMG market and the fact that I have to make a decision at work on bundling a mini-game with our main app. The multi-gaming segment is also growing at about 40% y-o-y which is the highest among all RMG segments. While one can argue that this growth was mostly driven by monstrous advertisement spends, this document tries to dig a bit deeper into the user behavior/personas between Multi Gaming Platforms and Single Gaming Platforms, framework to define value of adding/removing each game in the bundle, mental models for packaging games and finally some perspectives on user requirements/needs and way forward for building multi gaming apps. We want to basically explore why everybody is packaging games together or building yet another subscription service?</description>
