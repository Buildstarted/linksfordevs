      <title>100 Tips for a Better Life - LessWrong</title>
      <link>https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7hFeMWC6Y5eaSixbD/100-tips-for-a-better-life</link>
      <description>The other day I made an advice thread based on Jacobian’s from last year! If you
know a source for one of these, shout and I’ll edit it in.



Possessions

1 .If you want to find out about people’s opinions on a product, google 
&amp;lt;product&amp;gt; reddit. You’ll get real people arguing, as compared to the SEO’d
Google results.

2. Some banks charge you $20 a month for an account, others charge you 0. If
you’re with one of the former, have a good explanation for what those $20 are
buying.

3. Things you use for a significant fraction of your life (bed: 1/3rd,
office-chair: 1/4th) are worth investing in.

4. “Where is the good knife?” If you’re looking for your good X, you have bad
Xs. Throw those out.

5. If your work is done on a computer, get a second monitor. Less time
navigating between windows means more time for thinking.

6. Establish clear rules about when to throw out old junk. Once clear rules are
established, junk will probably cease to be a problem. This is because any rule
would be superior to our implicit rules (“keep this broken stereo for five years
in case I learn how to fix it”).

7. Don’t buy CDs for people. They have Spotify. Buy them merch from a band they
like instead. It’s more personal and the band gets more money.

8. When buying things, time and money trade-off against each other. If you’re
low on money, take more time to find deals. If you’re low on time, stop looking
for great deals and just buy things quickly online.



Cooking

9. Steeping minutes: Green at 3, black at 4, herbal at 5. Good tea is that
simple!

10. Food actually can be both cheap, healthy, tasty, and relatively quick to
prepare. All it requires is a few hours one day to prepare many meals for the
week.

11. Cooking pollutes the air. Opening windows for a few minutes after cooking
can dramatically improve air quality.

12. Food taste can be made much more exciting through simple seasoning. It’s
also an opportunity for expression. Buy a few herbs and spices and experiment
away.

      <title>Unconscious Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://droctothorpe.github.io/posts/2020/12/unconscious-algorithms/</link>
      <description>The goal of this article is to convey an approach to solving data structure and algorithm problems. My hope is that it helps you in a situation where you might otherwise draw a blank.
I want to start by stating an obvious but important truth: your brain is amazing. You are constantly and rapidly solving unimaginably complex problems that make even the most challenging FAANG whiteboard problem look like a stroll in the park.</description>

loperamide, a drug commonly used against diarrhoea, proves effective against
glioblastoma cells. A research team at Goethe University has now unravelled the
drug’s mechanisms &amp;#160;of action of cell
death induction and – in doing so – has shown how this compound could help attack
brain tumours that otherwise are difficult to treat.</description>

      <title>MAPS.ME is gone. We must bring it back.</title>
      <link>https://telegra.ph/What-happened-to-the-old-MAPSME-12-20</link>
      <description>TL;DR: MAPS.ME got bought by a payments company and completely rewritten, I want it back. I will rebuild the original app and bring it back. Sign up for this email list to get the original version back. Or subscribe to this Telegram channel.
On December 20th, 2020, version 2.0 of the MAPS.ME app got pushed to the Apple App Store. It is expected to land on Android in the coming days.
This is due to the app being sold off to a South Korean payments company.
What changed?
