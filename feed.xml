      <title>So you want to build an embedded Linux system? - Jay Carlson</title>
      <link>https://jaycarlson.net/embedded-linux/</link>
      <description>After I published my $1 MCU write-up, several readers suggested I look at application processors — the MMU-endowed chips necessary to run real operating systems like Linux. Massive shifts over the last few years have seen internet-connected devices become more featureful (and hopefully, more secure), and I’m finding myself putting Linux into more and more places.</description>

      <description>Have you ever tried to optimize a system but found it just would not get 
any faster than some seemingly arbitrary point?  Did it seem like the 
stuff somehow had an agreement to where it would never deliver results 
to in less than X milliseconds, even if it was unloaded and had a 
super-quick network link between the devices?</description>

      <description>Since .NET 5 was announced, many of you have asked what this means for .NET Standard and whether it will still be relevant. In this post, I’m going to explain how .NET 5 improves code sharing and replaces .NET Standard. I’ll also cover the cases where you still need .NET Standard.</description>

      <description>Last time, we learned how to add structured binding support to your own types, and noted that the get functions do not have to return references. C++/WinRT has something similar to a std::pair: The IKeyValuePair&amp;lt;K, V&amp;gt;, which is used to represent a single entry in a map.</description>

      <title>Introduction to quantum computing with Q# – Part 9, BB84 Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://www.strathweb.com/2020/10/introduction-to-quantum-computing-with-q-part-9-bb84-quantum-key-distribution/</link>
      <description>This is already part 9 of the series (time flies!). So far we have covered a wide array of topic around the nature of quantum computational units called qubits, superposition, entanglement, single-qubit gates, multi-qubit gates and some interesting concepts from the area of quantum information theory. In this post we will shift our attention to another interesting field in the quantum landscape – quantum cryptography. More specifically, we will explore a reference protocol for quantum key distribution, called BB884, discuss why it’s secure even when using a public channel to exchange qubits and realize a simple demonstrative implementation using Q#.</description>

      <description>A little while back I posted a couple of pictures of my new desk setup using both a Windows Laptop (a 2019 Dell XPS) and a Macbook Pro (2016) along with two 4k displays. I&amp;#39;m also using a single Logitech Mouse and Keyboard combination to control both machines and quite a few people were asking about how this works. So I decided to write a quick review of my setup here to give a few more details that are hard to give in a Twitter conversation.</description>

      <title>Personal identifiability of user tracking data during observation of 360-degree VR video</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74486-y#disqus_thread</link>
      <description>Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that is gaining traction in the consumer market. With it comes an unprecedented ability to track body motions. These body motions are diagnostic of personal identity, medical conditions, and mental states. Previous work has focused on the identifiability of body motions in idealized situations in which some action is chosen by the study designer. In contrast, our work tests the identifiability of users under typical VR viewing circumstances, with no specially designed identifying task. Out of a pool of 511 participants, the system identifies 95% of users correctly when trained on less than 5&amp;#160;min of tracking data per person. We argue these results show nonverbal data should be understood by the public and by researchers as personally identifying data.</description>

      <description>I get asked a lot about the tools I use at Stack Overflow to monitor and work with our SQL Servers. I figured it might be helpful to others to make the list public. I’ll also do my best to keep it updated as things change.
The current list of both free and 3rd party paid tools is below:

      <title>Embrace, Extend, Extinguish</title>
      <link>https://mikemcdonald.co/blog/2020/02/17/embrace-extend-extinguish/</link>
      <description>GitHub just released their gh CLI, with initial support for issues and pull requests. While it’s complimentary to git, gh squashes a bunch of otherwise confusing checkout and pull commands and makes the interface much cleaner.
It’s a slick experience that I’m sure will continue to see growth, and at some point gh commands will start making an appearance on GitHub docs and eventually on the main site, for example in the “clone or download” tab on a repo, the default could be gh clone org/repo instead of using git over SSH.</description>

Scott talks to Guy about how he did it, and how VR Desktop made a $400 VR headset into Scott&amp;#39;s primary rig...wirelessly! And it&amp;#39;s written entirely in C#? With latency in the low milliseconds!? Impossible.</description>
