      <description>UNIX shell isn’t a real programming language, so stop using like one! There are occasions one has to use shell due to the structure of UNIX (e.g. the hash-bang, ~/.profile, /etc/init.d/).

      <title>Year(Decade) of the Homelab.</title>
      <link>https://mahdiyusuf.com/posts/year-of-the-homelab/</link>
      <description>You can find audio to this post here.
I’m usually not huge on sticking flag poles in the ground regarding the direction technology will take in the coming years/decades. You can already see me hedging by saying decades in the title. I believe home labs (servers for home use) will become a thing this year(decade) is over.
As privacy and security become more of concern with breaches happening every day, more companies (Facebook) have less and less regard for your privacy.</description>

      <title>Reverse Engineering Source Code of the Biontech Pfizer Vaccine: Part 2 - Articles</title>
      <link>https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/part-2-reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/</link>
      <description>All BNT162b2 vaccine data on this page is sourced from this World Health Organization document.
 This is a living page, shared already so people can get going! But check back frequently for updates.
 In short: the vaccine mRNA has been optimized by the manufacturer by changing bits of RNA from (say) UUU to UUC, and people would like to understand the logic behind these changes. This challenge is quite close to what cryptologists and reverse engineering people encounter regularly.</description>
