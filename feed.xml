      <title>The Machine Learning SaaS Multiplier – Michael Bastos</title>

      <description>In today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape, startups must continually seek innovative ways to stand out and gain a competitive edge. One powerful tool at their disposal is machine learning, a game-changing technology that can serve as a force multiplier to optimize performance, enhance customer experiences, and drive growth. By understanding the four key types of learning – classification, prediction, interpretation, and generation – and integrating them into your SaaS company’s workflows, you can level up your customers into power users and propel your startup to new heights.

      <title>Controlling My AC Unit With nanoFramework</title>
      <link>https://blog.mrcsharp.com.au/post/controlling-my-ac-unit-with-nanoframework/</link>
      <description>Why My room’s AC unit (Panasonic) is quite old. It does a great job cooling/heating the place after all these years, but also lacks any “smart” capabilities found on modern units.
Personally, I am not a fan of making everything at my home internet-connected for reasons I won’t delve into now, and I certainly don’t want my AC unit to be internet-connected either. However, I want to be able to expand on its functionality as needed.</description>

      <title>Recursive LLMs</title>
      <link>https://tevfik.xyz/posts/recursive-llms/</link>
      <description>Last week was a thrilling week for the world of AI, and I had two significant realizations that I want to share with you.
Realisation 1: Language Models (LLMs) are stateful and become more powerful with more context. Most software we use is stateless, meaning that each time we open an app, it behaves almost the same way and stores minimal information about our past. This is easier for engineers, but it is limiting.</description>

      <title>Why Janet?</title>
      <link>https://ianthehenry.com/posts/why-janet/</link>
      <description>I never thought it could happen to me. I mean, parentheses? In this day and age? But for the past couple years, my go-to programming language for fun side projects has been a little Lisp dialect called Janet.
(print &amp;quot;hey janet&amp;quot;)
I like Janet so much that I wrote an entire book about it, and put it on The Internet for free, in the hopes of attracting more Janetors to the language.
I think you should read it, but I know that you don’t believe me, so I’m going to try to convince you. Here’s my attempt at a sales pitch: here is why you – you of all people – should give Janet a chance.</description>

      <description>The Free Software Foundation is one of the longest-running missions in the
free software movement, effectively defining it. It provides a legal foundation
for the movement and organizes activism around software freedom. The GNU
project, closely related, has its own long story in our movement as the coding
arm of the Free Software Foundation, taking these principles and philosophy into
practice by developing free software; notably the GNU operating system that
famously rests atop GNU/Linux.</description>
