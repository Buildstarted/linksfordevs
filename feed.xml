      <title>Writing a Unix clone in about a month</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2024/05/24/2024-05-24-Bunnix.html</link>
      <description>I needed a bit of a break from “real work” recently, so I started a new
programming project that was low-stakes and purely recreational. On April 21st,
I set out to see how much of a Unix-like operating system for x86_64 targets
that I could put together in about a month. The result is
Bunnix. Not including days I didn’t work
on Bunnix for one reason or another, I spent 27 days on this project.</description>

      <title>Successful language model evals — Jason Wei</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonwei.net/blog/evals</link>
      <description>Everybody uses evaluation benchmarks (“evals”), but I think they deserve more attention than they are currently getting. Evals are incentives for the research community, and breakthroughs are often closely linked to a huge performance jump on some eval. In fact, I’d argue that a key job of the team </description>

      <description>A couple of days ago, I was demoralized by a minor Jekyll issue. I was thinking about generating a single Atom feed from two content types. Turns out the plugin provided by GitHub Pages can’t do this directly.</description>

      <title>Solodevs and the trap of the game engine</title>
      <link>https://zylinski.se/posts/solodevs-and-the-trap-of-the-game-engine/</link>
      <description>Since I was 19 I’ve wanted to make my own video games, as in creating everything in the game myself, often referred to as being a solo developer, or solodev. But I was bad at committing to anything and I always thought that I lacked some specific skill such as music making, game design skills and art skills.
Now I’m 35 and just released my own game (see trailer below). I’ve made everything in it myself.</description>

      <title>A Simple QR Based Food Ordering App</title>
      <link>https://indrajith.me/posts/a-simple-qr-based-food-ordering-app/</link>
      <description>Why During my stay at a hostel in Bangalore, I noticed the inconvenience of the existing food ordering system in the hostel. To order food, we had to call the cook and place our orders verbally or find the cook and place the order directly if you are new to the place.
The menu was displayed on the wall near the kitchen, making it cumbersome to browse and decide. After a few days of this, I thought a QR-based food ordering system would be a great improvement.</description>
