      <title>Engineering Management Is Being Gatekept?! - Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=IKmqW6r3oyk</link>
      <description>So you're interested in heading down the people management path in an engineering manager role? Well...

You won't like it. It's sooooo much work. Trust me, you'd be better at something else. We'll talk about it when you're a senior or principal.

Does any of that sound familiar? Why the HECK are managers gatekeeping the EM role?! Let's talk about it.

As with all livestreams, I'm looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.
