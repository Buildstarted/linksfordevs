      <title>Goals, Guidelines, and Process (gpugoo.com design doc I wrote who knows when)</title>
      <link>https://dtmf.com/2023/11/18/goals-guidelines-and-process/</link>
      <description>What is/isn&amp;amp;#x27;t design?Design is not a collection of pictures or a set of colors. Design is how something works, the nature of the interaction we have with a system. The design of a shitty chair is shitty because it hurts so we notice it. The design of a gas pump is invisible and a child that can barely talk can operate a system that is fairly dangerous without much instruction or potential for failure. Design is a set of rules that conduct how something should be used and experienced.What is good design?Good design is invisible, because of the nature of design it&amp;amp;#x27;s hard to determine from the outshot how someone has arrived at a convention or tool that makes your life easier and is enjoyable to use. When you set out for good design you need to have clear goals. You outline the goals and then you whittle away every unnecessary component until you have a thing that does what you need and nothing more and nothing less. To get to these points you have the tricky task of figuring out what a user of your object, service, or tool needs. Often times the actual user cannot tell you this because they don&amp;amp;#x27;t know what they like or why even more rarely do they have any idea what they need. Often at the root of things that people like is that they are not frustrated and they feel comfortable.</description>

      <title>Every Day is Acting School: How to Manage Creative Works, with Humans, for Money.</title>
      <link>https://blog.millerhooks.com/edias/</link>
      <description>In 2015 I had the most difficult year of my life until this year. I left a CTO position for a product I’d built from the ground up. I let a vampire into my life through business that violently exploded, threatened to unlive me and several other people I knew, and stabbed a coworker. I had a difficult time maintaining relationships through it. I couldn’t go back to work because I didn’t care. I had been asked to help a company that had an IT department that went off the rails and was holding the biz hostage. I did too good of a job at that and everyone that read my report quit or was fired. I had a decent kill fee and they changed who I reported to without notice so I got paid. So I had enough money to float. And ponder. And float. And float.I gave away everything I owned and wandered around. I guess I’m still wandering, but the wandering stops now. I’ve found and collected what I was looking for.</description>

Some skills are obvious, like understanding technical topics, learning new things, and thinking like a computer, but there’s a separate class of unobvious skills that an outsider may not immediately think of when they imagine a career in software.1
