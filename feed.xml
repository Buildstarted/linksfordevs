      <description>Uninterrupted, good quality mobile phone reception is extremely important to rail passengers. In technical terms, it’s the pi&amp;#232;ce de r&amp;#233;sistance for every network provider because the demands on bandwidth increase with data-intensive applications. Swisscom has now successfully achieved a transmission speed of over 1 Gigabit per second on a moving train under test conditions. This result sets a new benchmark for the mobile phone industry.</description>

      <title>Is Software Contracting For You? - Mischa Spiegelmock</title>
      <link>https://spiegelmock.com/2020/10/20/is-software-contracting-for-you/</link>
      <description>If you&amp;#39;re a full-time employee, becoming a contractor means giving up some job security. You may not have a guaranteed paycheck for a while, if ever. Being a contractor, especially if you&amp;#39;re starting out and doing it alone, brings many uncertainties. However working as a full-time employee carries its own sort of risks. Job security isn&amp;#39;t what it used to be, spending time on bureaucracy and pleasing your superiors may not make you fulfilled, and there&amp;#39;s a real limit to how much you can accomplish for yourself as part of a larger organization.  There is comfort in working at a company; all you have to do is show up and be told what to do, you don&amp;#39;t have to think much about taxes or contracts, someone else can make a lot of the decisions about how to run the company. But if you want to take on more responsibility, have the opportunity to grow and learn to run your own business, and do things your way then consider becoming a contractor. Almost everyone I know who works for a company of any size will be happy to tell you all about the mistakes and boneheaded ideas of their superiors. Everyone has ideas of how the company they work for could be run better. I say if you really believe this then work for yourself.</description>

      <title>Defining Service Boundaries by Splitting Entities</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGvYHmvXiyk</link>
      <description>Defining Service Boundaries is a really important part of building a loosely coupled system, yet can often be difficult.  Here&amp;#39;s one way of realizing where service boundaries lie but looking at Entities and the properties and how they relate.  Remember not to fall into the trap of having an entity have to live in one sole location.

      <description>I’ve come to the conclusion that, for me, ORMs are more detriment than
benefit. In short, they can be used to nicely augment working with SQL
in a program, but they should not replace it.</description>

      <link>https://raymii.org/s/blog/I_enforced_the_AGPL_on_my_code_heres_how_it_went.html</link>
      <description>Five years ago I made a website that allowed you to put in a few domains and get 
an email when the SSL certificate was about to expire. No ads, no fuss, just
an easy way for people to keep tabs on their sites without setting up their
own monitoring like Nagios. As with all of my software, I released it under
the GPL, specificaly the AGPL due to it being web based software. The AGPL
differs from the GPL on one point, simplified, you have to release the source
of any modifications you make under the same license, even when you host the software (not distribute)
online. With the regular GPL, you don&amp;#39;t have to release the source if you 
provide a modified version online, only if you distribute it.</description>

      <description>One of the most common “data type” in programming is the text string. When programmers think of a string, they imagine that they are dealing with a list or an array of characters. It is often a “good enough” approximation, but reality is more complex. The characters must be encoded into bits in some way.&amp;#160;Most … Continue reading Ridiculously fast unicode (UTF-8) validation</description>
