      <title>It's like JSON. but fast and small.</title>
      <link>https://msgpack.org/</link>
      <description>MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.</description>

      <description>As we all know, unless you can afford a medical concierge and the most expensive insurance and facilities, the for-profit, private-insurance-based health care system in the United States is somewhere between a headache and a nightmare. Inpatient mental health care is no exception. The quality of life is ultimately defined by your insurance company’s concern to avoid liability.</description>

      <description>We need your help! Folding@home is joining researchers around the world working to better understand the 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to accelerate the open science effort to develop new life-saving therapies. By downloading Folding@Home, you can donate your unused computational resources to the Folding@home Consortium, where researchers working to advance our understanding of the structures of potential drug targets for 2019-nCoV that could aid in the design of new therapies. The data you help us generate will be quickly and openly disseminated as part of an open science collaboration of multiple laboratories around the world, giving researchers new tools that may unlock new opportunities for developing lifesaving drugs.</description>

      <title>Making Your Code Faster by Taming Branches </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/articles/making-code-faster-taming-branches/</link>
      <description>Most software code contains conditional branches. In code, they appear in if-then-else clauses, loops, and switch-case constructs.  For better performance, modern processors predict the branch and execute the following instructions speculatively. It is a powerful optimization.</description>

      <title>This is How Science Happens • Hillel Wayne</title>
      <link>https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/this-is-how-science-happens/</link>
      <description>I love science. Not the “space is beautiful” faux-science, but the process of doing science. Hours spent calibrating equipment, cross-checking cites of cites of cites, tedious arguments about p-values and prediction intervals, all the stuff that makes science Go. And, when it does happen, the drama. I also want us to use more empirical science in software. That’s why I wrote a talk on it!
One thing lay folk don’t realize is that science is social.</description>

      <description>Weekly Dev Tips offers a variety of technical and career tips for software developers. Each tip is quick and to the point, describing a problem and one or more ways to solve that problem.

      <title>What's a key exchange?</title>
      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/496/whats-a-key-exchange/</link>
      <description>I've been writing about cryptography for a book for a year now, and it has brought me some interesting challenges.
One of them is that I constantly have to throw away what I've learned a long time ago, and imagine what it feels like not to know about a concept.
For example what are key exchanges? 
The most intuitive explanation that I knew of (up until recently) was the one given by the wikipedia ...</description>

      <title>Using git tag for Presentations or Workshops</title>
      <link>https://www.josephguadagno.net/2020/03/10/using-git-tag-for-presentations-or-workshops</link>
      <description>While we hope it never happens, demo failures happen when presenting talks or doing workshops. I do not know of a speaker that has not had a demo go bad while up on stage or live streams. Many of us have a back up plan… After searching around for solutions for this, I decided to use git tagging to solve this for me.</description>

      <title>Hack Your Career - Troy Hunt</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d7_4JXWtFY</link>
      <description>Originally, I was content in my job, happy even. But over time I grew to want more; more job satisfaction, more opportunities, more progression. I started working on making this possible at every opportunity; while I was in the office, nights, weekends, holidays – “hacking my career” to get more out of it whenever I had the chance. Eventually, I grew tired of my windowless office. I became frustrated with car spaces being assigned based on years of service. I didn’t like that in order for my career to “progress”, I had to give up doing what I loved. I hated my salary being determined by an Excel spreadsheet that was indexed against industry norms. I didn’t want to be an industry norm! So I changed it all, entirely independently and against most conventional wisdoms.

In this talk, I’ll take you through my journey from a normal everyday corporate software job to complete independence. I’ll share the things I did that made me happier and more productive whilst I was there, but also what I did to ultimately give me the choices in life to focus on the things I love doing in a post-corporate world. You’ll see what worked well, what failed, the abuse I got along the way and ultimately, what the spoils of success look like today.

This talk is for everyone who wants to get more out of their technology career whether that be in their existing role or somewhere new in the future. It will inspire, motivate and guide you on how to get started on hacking your own career.
