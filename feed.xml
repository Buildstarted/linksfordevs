      <title>Toward a "modern" Emacs</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/832311/03910e26a3f3e814/</link>
      <description>It has only been a few months since the Emacs community went through an extended discussion on how to make the Emacs editor "popular
again".  As the community gears up for the Emacs 28 development cycle,
(after the Emacs
27.1 release in August)
that discussion has returned with a vengeance.  The themes of this
discussion differ somewhat from the last; developers are concerned about
making Emacs — an editor with decades of history — seem "modern" to attract
new users.</description>

      <title>Swift System is Now Open Source</title>
      <link>https://swift.org/blog/swift-system/</link>
      <description>In June, Apple introduced Swift System, a new library for Apple platforms that provides idiomatic interfaces to system calls and low-level currency types. Today, I’m excited to announce that we’re open-sourcing System and adding Linux support! Our vision is for System to eventually act as the single home for low-level system interfaces for all supported Swift platforms.

Apart from the whole framework being surprisingly well thought through, there are a few things that strike me as being done exceptionally well in Phoenix, compared to the rest of modern web frameworks.
