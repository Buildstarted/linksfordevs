      <title>From Laura Baldwin - O’Reilly Media</title>
      <link>https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/from-laura-baldwin.html</link>
      <description>It has been a rough few weeks as we’ve seen the COVID-19 virus take a toll on our livelihoods, our families and the world economy. People are losing their lives, and businesses are suffering in the shadow of revenue losses and a volatile stock market. The virus has had a material impact on O’Reilly’s in-person Events division as well. We previously made the painful decision to cancel our Strata California and Strata London events. Today, we’re sharing the news that we’ve made the very difficult decision to cancel all future O’Reilly in-person conferences and close down this portion of our business. Without understanding when this global health emergency may come to an end, we can’t plan for or execute on a business that will be forever changed as a result of this crisis. With large technology vendors moving their events completely on-line, we believe the stage is set for a new normal moving forward when it comes to in-person events. We also know we are poised to accept that challenge, having already delivered a version of our Strata event on-line to over 4600 participants last week. With over 5000 companies and 2.5 million users on our learning platform, we look forward to innovating and bringing together the technology communities and businesses we serve in new and creative ways.</description>

      <title>Thought Experiment - Futility Closet</title>
      <link>https://www.futilitycloset.com/2011/06/21/thought-experiment/</link>
      <description>On Twin Earth, a brain in a vat is at the wheel of a runaway trolley. There are only two options that the brain can take: the right side of the fork in the track or the left side of the fork. There is no way in sight of derailing or stopping the trolley and the brain is aware of this, for the brain knows trolleys. The brain is causally hooked up to the trolley such that the brain can determine the course which the trolley will take. On the right side of the track there is a single railroad...</description>

      <title>Getting Started With .NET Localization</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/getting-started-with-net-localization</link>
      <description>I have a dirty little secret to admit, and I hope you don’t think less of me for saying so. I have never localized any application that I’ve ever built. Phew, I feel better getting that off my chest. I like to think it’s something we’ve all done.</description>
