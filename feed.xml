      <title>Scales of cities, scales of software</title>
      <link>https://linus.coffee/note/software-cities/</link>
      <description>American cities seem like a product of industrial processes where older European cities seem like a product of human processes. This is because most American cities were built after and alongside the car and the industrial revolution – the design of cities took into account what was easily possible, and that guided the shape and scale of everything.</description>

      <title>Summary after Four Months with Ada — Programming with Ada documentation</title>
      <link>https://pyjarrett.github.io/programming-with-ada/four-months-summary.html</link>
      <description>For the last four months I’ve been learning and writing Ada 2012.
I wanted to share my experiences with the language for those who aren’t familiar with it.
I’m neither endorsing or denouncing Ada.
For those unfamiliar with Ada terms, I’ll using the vernacular common to C family languages.
This will make Ada programmers cringe, but will be much more clear to the general reader.</description>

      <title>Reverse engineering software licencing from early-2000s abandonware – Part 1</title>
      <link>https://yingtongli.me/blog/2021/08/29/drm5-1.html</link>
      <description>This series concerns a software licencing system used in a proprietary software application from circa 2004. The software was available in an unregistered trial mode with limited functionality. A free licence could be obtained by registering online with the software vendor. The software became abandonware circa 2009 when it ceased to be offered, and while the software binary has been archived, to date there has been no effort to restore the functionality once available with a free licence.</description>
