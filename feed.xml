      <title>REST Constraint #6: Code on Demand‚ÄîWhen, Why, and How to Use It - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/rest-constraint-6-code-on-demand-when-why-and-how-to-use-it/</link>
      <description>Of all the REST constraints, Code on Demand is the one that most developers either overlook or actively avoid. Unlike the other five constraints, it is the only optional one, meaning a RESTful system doesn‚Äôt have to use it. But when applied correctly, it can unlock powerful capabilities in web applications. Let‚Äôs explore what Code on Demand is, when it makes sense to use it, and why most REST APIs don‚Äôt rely on it.</description>

      <description>For many years now I‚Äôve had at least one machine at home which would work as a server to host some apps. In the last couple of years I‚Äôve been getting more into it which has led me to purchase additional hardware. I‚Äôve decided it would be nice to document my journey so I‚Äôll try to make a post like this - detailing the setup that I currently have with both the hardware and the software once a year.</description>

      <description>Ever since launching in March 2024, I‚Äôve often referred to working on the
project as ‚Äúrearranging deck chairs on the Titanic‚Äù. Well after a year of
full-time work in a Michelin starred kitchen and completely ignoring anything
to do with the site I can tell you with confidence that
the Titanic is now firmly resting on the bottom of the ocean.</description>

It is common to run some commands via the postgres account as it is the de facto PostgreSQL super user. This means that if you're running these commands remotely, you'll need to chain sudo:



ssh pg-host sudo -i sudo -u postgres ...

      <title>REST Constraint #5: Embracing Layers for Flexibility and Scale - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/rest-constraint-5-embracing-layers-for-flexibility-and-scale/</link>
      <description>Building a reliable, scalable web application is no easy feat. The internet is unpredictable, traffic surges happen, and security threats lurk around every corner. That‚Äôs why REST includes the Layered System constraint‚Äîa design principle that structures applications into multiple layers, each handling a specific role. Whether it‚Äôs distributing traffic, securing data, or managing services, layering helps RESTful systems stay resilient and adaptable.</description>
