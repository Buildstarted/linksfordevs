      <title>Wiki - PinebookProSixMonthsIn</title>
      <link>https://wiki.alopex.li/PinebookProSixMonthsIn</link>
      <description>There’s been a lot of excited reviews among the more nerdly segments of society about the Pinebook Pro, a 14-inch, $200 Linux laptop using an ARM CPU and generally open-source hardware. Rumors are it’s extremely solid for a piece of hardware that’s far below the “bargain” price range and into the “fell off the back of a truck” pile. However, I recently read someone complaining that there’s been lots of “fresh new user” blog posts and no “how does this actually work six months in” write-ups. It just so happens that I’ve had my Pinebook Pro as my main laptop for nearly six months now, so I thought I’d write up my experiences with it so far.</description>

      <title>How We Solved the Worst Minigame in Zelda's History</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1hs451PfFzQ</link>
      <description>Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/linkus7/

After Years of having to deal with Sploosh Kaboom, the Battleship Minigame in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, we have finally found a way to beat it consistently. This is the result of many people's efforts to Reverse Engineer Wind Waker and craft a program that can take advantage of its structure.

This video would have not been possible without Peter Schmidt-Nielsen.
All the Animations in this video were created by Peter in Javascript using d3, so huge shout out to him for putting in such great work!

We stopped for a while, but recently we've played simplified versions of Ticket to Ride, Race for the Galaxy, Guillotine, and Settlers of Catan. My general approach here is to find a core piece of the game that will be fun on its own, and then add to it as Lily wants more complexity.  While the parti</description>
