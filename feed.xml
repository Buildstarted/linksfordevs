      <title>Eight Billion People - OranLooney.com</title>
      <link>https://www.oranlooney.com/post/eight-billion/</link>
      <description>Today is the last day when the number of people alive will start with a seven. Sometime late Tuesday afternoon, or perhaps early Wednesday morning, the population will cross the eight billion mark. When I was a kid, the number they taught us in school was five billion. By the time I was in college, it was up to six, and a decade ago it hit seven.
Now it’s eight.</description>

      <title>How to Simulate MEV Arbitrage with REVM, Anvil and Alloy </title>
      <link>https://pawelurbanek.com/revm-alloy-anvil-arbitrage</link>
      <description>EVM simulation engine is a core component of any competitive MEV strategy. In this tutorial, I&amp;#39;ll describe how to use Anvil and its lower-level counterpart REVM to detect UniswapV3 MEV arbitrage opportunities. We will implement a working proof of concept using alloy-rs (a successor to ethers-rs). I&amp;#39;ll also discuss techniques for improving the performance and scalability of REVM-based simulations.</description>

      <title>What&amp;#39;s New in Neovim 0.10</title>
      <link>https://gpanders.com/blog/whats-new-in-neovim-0.10/</link>
      <description>Neovim 0.10 was the longest release cycle since the heady days of the 0.5 release. There are a ton of new features in this release (as well as some breaking changes), so be sure to check the full release notes. You can view the release notes directly in Nvim with :h news. The news file includes information on new features, deprecations, and breaking changes. I especially urge plugin authors to read this file carefully.</description>

      <title>Legalizations in LLVM Backend</title>
      <link>https://myhsu.xyz/llvm-codegen-legalization/</link>
      <description>Ideally, compilers can build a program for a wide variety of hardware without the need to change a single line of its source code. While there are exceptions and corner cases, this holds in the majority of cases. Which means that if the input code uses something that is not directly available on the hardware, the compiler has to figure out a way to effectively emulate those features.
This might sound a little distant to our typical software development experiences, but I’m not even talking about a problem that only happens on some exotic proprietary ML accelerator whatnots.</description>

      <title>Jepsen: Datomic Pro 1.0.7075</title>
      <link>https://jepsen.io/analyses/datomic-pro-1.0.7075</link>
      <description>Datomic is a temporal Entity-Attribute-Value OLTP database which supports non-interactive transactions on top of pluggable storage engines. It offers a variety of query mechanisms across thick and thin clients, including Datalog, graph traversal, and an ODM-style API. We evaluated Datomic Pro 1.0.7075 and found its inter-transaction safety properties appear stronger than claimed. Not only was every history Serializable, but sessions bound to a single peer appear Strong Session Serializable, and histories restricted to write transactions and reads using d/sync appear Strong Serializable. However, inside of a transaction Datomic behaves as if operations were evaluated concurrently. Depending on how one interprets those operations, this might violate three of the most widely accepted formalizations of Serializability, each of which specify serial intra-transaction semantics. It also creates the potential for invariant violations when composing transaction functions. Datomic has published a companion blog post alongside this report. This work was funded by Nubank (Nu Pagamentos S.A), and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy.</description>
