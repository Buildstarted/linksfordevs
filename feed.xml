      <title>Self Hosting Password Manager</title>
      <link>https://rohanrd.xyz/posts/self-hosting-password-manager/</link>
      <description>Are you tired of entrusting your passwords and personal information to third-party services that may or may not have your best interests at heart? Are you ready to take control of your own data and security? If so, self-hosting a password manager might be the perfect adventure for you! It takes a bit of technical know-how and a whole lot of bravery, but the rewards are well worth it. Not only will you have the peace of mind that comes with knowing your sensitive information is being stored on your own servers, but you’ll also have the opportunity to customize your password management solution to suit your specific needs.</description>
