      <title>We Should All Be API Consumers</title>
      <link>https://apievangelist.com/2022/10/26/we-should-all-be-api-consumers/</link>
      <description>I have long advocated that API producers should spend more time being an API consumer, so that they can feel the pain. I feel 100x this since I have been working at Postman. When you operate at the line between API producers and consumers, but also the automation of the API lifecycle, you really begin to see that the balance between producer and consumer is what matters the most. Even with my perspective I am heavily indoctrinated into the API producer side of the conversation. After over a decade of working with API service providers who mostly are serving the API producer I just end up with a bias in that direction. Working at Postman has changed that, and since I hired Deepa Goyal on my team, I am regularly being schooled about why the consumer view needs more prioritization.</description>

      <title>Digital Marbling</title>
      <link>https://blog.amandaghassaei.com/2022/10/25/digital-marbling/</link>
      <description>Marbling is heritage craft that uses the movement of fluids to create swirling patterns of inks and paints, often resulting in designs reminiscent of marbled stone. The earliest accounts of marbling date back to the 12th century in Japan, where it is known as “suminagashi.” Inks were floated on top of water and manipulated into delicate, flowing shapes using breath, fans, and other utensils, and finally transferred to paper (and sometimes fabric). Later, paper marbling traditions emerged in the Middle East and Europe, making use of more viscous media and fine-toothed combs to create repeating patterns with greater regularity and control. Marbled paper is commonly used in bookbinding as a decorative endpaper:</description>
