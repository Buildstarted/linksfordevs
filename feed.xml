      <description>One question that comes up a lot when getting started with IoT is 'How do I store all this data?'. This is an important question - IoT creates a LOT of data, some of which can be analyzed on the fly, but there are a large number of cases where you want to run analytics later, or have access to histo...</description>

      <title>Getting started with Uno Platform and ReactiveUI - Uno Platform</title>
      <link>https://platform.uno/blog/getting-started-with-uno-platform-and-reactiveui/</link>
      <description>Summary The article shows how to create a cross-platform Uno template app that consists of a basic NavigationView and basic ViewModel navigation capabilities, and can run on Windows, Android, iOS, and as a website (via WASM). It uses the following frameworks: Uno Platform, ReactiveUI, and Microsoft Extensions for hosting, dependency injection, and for logging. GitHub code The Code is located under the UnoRx repo on GitHub, so just clone the code from GitHub to start an Uno project with RxUI and Microsoft Extensions DI and logging. Be Reactive What’s System.Reactive (Rx)? The System.Reactive (Rx hereinafter) library, is a set of extensions that offer LINQ-like extensions methods on the IObservable&lt;T&gt; type. An IObservable&lt;T&gt; is very similar to IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;. The major noticeable difference between the two is that while the IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; is pull-based, and the consuming part is the one making its move iterating and retrieving the data and the source listens, IObservable&lt;T&gt; is the opposite – the consumer listens to the source, and the source is the one notifying all listeners about a new item that is available. This makes subscribing to events, or any other unexpected data sources, even infinite ones very easy. Like LINQ, Rx offers a wide set …</description>

      <title>Time Stand Still</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAPSK_cV5n0</link>
      <description>On January 7, 2020, the music industry lost a giant. Neil Peart, the drummer and lyricist for the band RUSH, lost a three and and a half year battle with glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer. Neil will forever be one of the most influential rock drummers of all time. Over RUSH’s 40 year career, his drumming and thoughtful lyrics have been part of the soundtrack to millions of lives around the globe, and his passing has created a huge void.

When SFC Tim Whalen heard the news, he was shocked and saddened. As a lifelong RUSH fan, he felt compelled to do something to honor Neil and the band that has meant so much in his own life. He immediately knew the song “Time Stand Still” would be the perfect choice.

SFC Whalen relfects, "The lyrics to this song have always resonated deeply with me, and they show Neil’s heart. I wanted to showcase the deep humanity he had in his writing. The song is about life moving too fast, due to both things we can control and things we can’t, and the desire to hold onto something just a little longer. This is such a universal message, whether it be children growing up too fast, a loved one dying, or a soldier leaving home wondering if they’ll ever see their family again.”

      <title>Security Scanning Your .NET Core Applications</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/security-scanning-dotnet-core-applications</link>
      <description>No organization exists in an operational vacuum. It’s a natural law of software development that your world will collide with other projects. It is inevitable to share responsibility between customers, vendors, partners, and the open-source ecosystem. In a past life, I worked with insurance carriers that each had stringent security policies placed on their partners. One of those policies included scanning all production code for known vulnerabilities. In this post, I’ll show you how to scan your system for security vulnerabilities throughout your development lifecycle.</description>

      <title>Hardware build: CRC calculation</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNkERQlK8j8</link>
      <description>CRC (cyclic redundancy check) involves some intimidating math. But it turns out that it can all be done with some fairly simple hardware. In this video, I build the hardware to compute and verify CRCs. Previous video on CRC theory is here: https://youtu.be/izG7qT0EpBw

      <title>How To Create a Blazor Component</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijIjg2XAVK8</link>
      <description>In this video, we're going to learn how to create a Blazor component for a Blazor application. We create a template and write C# code to connect the component with the application.

If you are new to Blazor make sure you have watched the Blazor introduction video first. In this video, I'm going to focus on creating a Blazor component.

Creating a Blazor component is one of the first things we want to do when we create a Blazor application. As we learned in the Blazor introduction, Blazor applications consist of many Blazor components. A Blazor component represents a part of the user interface and can be reused in your application or even in multiple applications.

In this video, I use a Blazor Server application created using the standard application template of Visual Studio 2019. The code works with .NET Core 3.1.

If you have any questions, write it in the comments below and feel free to provide feedback, and if you have any video ideas, put it in the comments as well.

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVbTmgbiZsA</link>
      <description>Starting with .NET Core 2.1 a new feature called Local GC has been added. It allows you to do magic things - you can completely replace the default GC used by the runtime with your own, or you can use the default GC outside .NET environment.

In the session we will look at this possibilities - how and why we can do it. We'll find out exactly where to start writing your own GC and whether it is difficult or not.

      <description>Between releases of my other book (Professional ASP.NET MVC, next release due out soon!) Jesse Liberty somehow talked me into collaborating with him on writing a book on Windows 8.1 development. Actually, it wasn't a hard sell, because I've done a good amount of XAML dev, love C#, and Windows 8 / 8.1 development is a lot of fun. We co-wrote the table of contents, I wrote code samples and very rough drafts (sometimes just bullet points), and Jesse turned it into prose. That worked pretty well, but was a little too slow - especially once my work on Professional ASP.NET MVC 5 ramped up. Fortunately, Phil Japiske agreed to join us and finish the book off. Phil really nailed it - he polished off the remaining chapters, reviewed and greatly improved the existing chapters, and made sure everything was up to date for Windows 8.1.</description>

      <title>Update on our new and upcoming security keys</title>
      <link>https://solokeys.com/blogs/news/update-on-our-new-and-upcoming-security-keys</link>
      <description>
 
Our current suite of products (Solo C, Solo A, Solo Tap A, Solo Tap C, Somu) make up the first generation of products that Solokeys has released, starting with our initial Kickstarter campaign.
Now we’re getting ready to release a new generation of products this year that completely redesign and upgrade everything we’ve done so far.  With our upcoming generation, we aim to really be the best security key for consumers and enterprise. 
Here’s the progress on physical upgrades, and a future post will cover the firmware &amp; feature improvements.
 
NFC
Our biggest priority with hardware was improving the NFC performance.  Primarily for mobile phones, which often have relatively weak NFC readers.Passive NFC for FIDO2 key is one of the more challenging NFC devices to get right.  Most NFC devices people interact with are more like NFC tags, which are essentially just a memory with static information, and only need very little power to work.  Whereas a FIDO2 device requires a full processor capable of quickly computing cryptographic operations, and requires considerable more power.  So to get it to work with weak NFC readers, it requires considerable optimization. Our upcoming keys are able to drive optimization in three areas.
The antenna
The NFC antenna has a more optimized geometry for mobile phones.  On average, it will be able to transfer more power.
Upgraded chipset
We're tracking to use a new chipset for NFC communication and NFC power harvesting.  It can handle faster timing requirements and larger buffers which overall increases reliability.
Less power consumption
Ever hear about Moore’s law?  Roughly, ever two years, the number of transistors on new processors doubles, due to semiconductor processes being able to make increasingly smaller transistors.  This allows new generations of processors to keep getting “faster.”Well, there’s a bunch of different transistor technologies.  There are transistor technologies dedicated for low power applications -- and every generation provides less power consumption for the same processor.We’ve upgraded to a new microcontroller for the new Solo products, and it nominally consumes about 25% less power, while having the same performance.  This is a great “free” optimization for us.Furthermore, our new microcontroller provides hardware acceleration for cryptographic operations (like ECC signatures), allowing us to actually both improve performance while reducing power.
Durability
We want to be able to guarantee that none of our products ever “break,” and can even survive underwater.To fulfill this, we’ll be the first to undertake a new PCB technology and epoxy filling process to guarantee a very robust and water-proof key.  The PCB will have a manufactured cavity where all the components will get assembled, and then filled with transparent epoxy.
The USB-C connector is made very robust with the addition of solder welds onto the cavity of the PCB.

Buttons
As you might notice, there’s now three side-buttons, and they are touch sensitive.  So it’s easier to “press” and no stress is given on the connecting socket, as with top-facing button.With there being more than one button, we plan to leverage multiple gesture for different applications.  For example, FIDO2 can require a touch on any button to approve a request (like normal).  But by pressing two buttons at once (giving the key a light “squeeze”), this could emit a static password or OTP.
High speed HSM
Our device will be capable of throughput on the order of 50MB/s, which can enable bulk encryption/decryption operations.  Asymmetric operations (like signing) can reach 10-40 operations / second, depending on the algorithm.
Firmware
Perhaps the most important, is the actual firmware features on the device.  We’ll get into more of this in a future post, but for now, know that we’re actively working on:* FIDO2* PIV / PKCS#11* Frictionless &amp; secure web-updateAnd it’s all written in Rust, which provides large safety guarantees and compile time assurance of isolation between apps on the key.
Keep me updated!

      <title>Copyrighting all the melodies to avoid accidental infringement | Damien Riehl | TEDxMinneapolis</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJtm0MoOgiU</link>
      <description>In the litany of copyright infringement lawsuits, technology lawyer and musician Damien Riehl demonstrates that music is merely math, and has a finite number of possible melodies. If you’ve ever thought a song you like sounded similar to another, the culprit may not be an unethical forger, but rather the limited mathematical musical equations that our favorite artists have to work with.  Current copyright law is at risk of severely limiting future music creation and future human creativity. This talk suggests a new way to handle these legal cases.  Damien Riehl is a technology lawyer with a B.S. in music. After beginning to code in 1985, and for the web in 1995, he has worked for the chief judges of state and federal courts; litigated for a decade; taught law-school copyright classes; and led teams in software development, digital forensics, proactive cybersecurity, reactive cybersecurity incidents, and world-scale investigations. Damien’s combined experience in the law, technology, and music has inspired his most recent project—copyrighting billions of unique melodies. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx</description>

      <title>Appstat - App Store Sales &amp; Analytics on your Mac</title>
      <link>https://gumroad.com/l/appstat</link>
      <description>With Appstat, your apps' status, proceeds, and analytics are just one click away. It lives in your Mac's status bar and, when clicked, displays all the apps you have for sale and how much you are making with each one. Once you try Appstat you'll wonder how you ever monitored app sales without it! For App Developers This app only fully functions if you are a developer with an active subscription with Apple. With just a click, Appstat displays all of the following information about your apps: Name and platform, Average proceeds per day (including in-app purchases), Average unit sales per day (including free apps), Bundle identifier and SKU, Your app's website, Original release date and time on the store, Latest version number and time on the store, Rate at which people rate your app (ratings/month), Latest version rating, Overall app rating, Device distribution based on purchases, Country distribution based on purchases, Chart of proceeds over time, Average proceeds per day, Projected proceeds per month and year, Chart of unit sales over time, Latest builds uploaded to TestFlight. All stats are linked to the appropriate section of Apple's developer site, making Appstat a great launchpad. Total store proceeds are also displayed: Average total proceeds per day (and standard deviation), Projected total proceeds per month (estimated using a configurable amount of history), Projected total proceeds per year. Now you can see how you're doing month by month or year by year. They're just projections so take them with a grain of salt! Security and privacy were taken seriously and baked into every step: No usernames or passwords needed! Appstat will never collect these and instead uses API keys generated securely on App Store Connect. All account settings are encrypted locally on your machine for your privacy. Absolutely no data is stored on the machine except those encrypted account settings. Everything is done in-memory and all data is lost when the app is closed. Only uses encrypted communication with Apple servers and never transmits any data to anyone else (especially not me, I don't want it). Doesn't waste battery or network time and fetches data only when you need it. I hope you love it!</description>

      <description>There are several ways of bootstrapping your MVC applications on top of ASP.NET Core 3.x. One thing that you need to do, in order to use the framework, is to initialize it into the state where it can actually discover your controllers, views, pages and expose them as HTTP endpoints.</description>

      <title>Copyrighting all the melodies to avoid accidental infringement | Damien Riehl | TEDxMinneapolis</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/sJtm0MoOgiU</link>
      <description>In the litany of copyright infringement lawsuits, technology lawyer and musician Damien Riehl demonstrates that music is merely math, and has a finite number of possible melodies. If you’ve ever thought a song you like sounded similar to another, the culprit may not be an unethical forger, but rather the limited mathematical musical equations that our favorite artists have to work with.  Current copyright law is at risk of severely limiting future music creation and future human creativity. This talk suggests a new way to handle these legal cases.  Damien Riehl is a technology lawyer with a B.S. in music. After beginning to code in 1985, and for the web in 1995, he has worked for the chief judges of state and federal courts; litigated for a decade; taught law-school copyright classes; and led teams in software development, digital forensics, proactive cybersecurity, reactive cybersecurity incidents, and world-scale investigations. Damien’s combined experience in the law, technology, and music has inspired his most recent project—copyrighting billions of unique melodies. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx</description>

Larry Tesler, who passed away on Monday, might not be a household name like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, but his contributions to making computers and mobile devices easier to use are the highlight of a long career influencing modern computing.</description>

      <description>At Let’s Encrypt we’re always looking for ways to improve the security and integrity of the Web PKI. We’re proud to launch multi-perspective domain validation today because we believe it’s an important step forward for the domain validation process. To our knowledge we are the first CA to deploy multi-perspective validation at scale.
Domain validation is a process that all CAs use to ensure that a certificate applicant actually controls the domain they want a certificate for.</description>

      <title>Latacora - Stop Using Encrypted Email</title>
      <link>https://latacora.singles/2020/02/19/stop-using-encrypted.html</link>
      <description>Email is unsafe and cannot be made safe. The tools we have today to encrypt email are badly flawed. Even if those flaws were fixed, email would remain unsafe. Its problems cannot plausibly be mitigated. Avoid encrypted email.
Technologists hate this argument. Few of them specialize in cryptography or privacy, but all of them are interested in it, and many of them tinker with encrypted email tools.
Most email encryption on the Internet is performative, done as a status signal or show of solidarity.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core Middleware Registration</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/aspnet-core-middleware-registration</link>
      <description>One of my favorite features of modern web development is Middleware. Middleware is a powerful abstraction that can encapsulate your intent, enrich an incoming request, enhance an outgoing response, or do all the above. Once you embrace Middleware as a potential approach to solving problems, it becomes second nature to think in that paradigm.</description>

      <title>Blazor, a new framework for browser-based .NET apps - Steve Sanderson</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khn7sDUSEJM</link>
