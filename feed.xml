      <title>10 Tips for Ramping Up as a Senior Engineer</title>
      <link>https://jdxcode.com/posts/2020-09-16-10-tips-ramping-up-as-a-senior-engineer/</link>
      <description>I've learned the hard way that starting a job on a large engineering team as a senior engineeer is more than simply writing good code. You have to drive initiatives at a social level and not simply because you know more about the codebase.
For a new hire this is especially a challenge. You need to learn the system that your colleagues already understand. You might be a higher level but you'll be a worse engineer for the first few months while you ramp up.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine recently got in touch with me, I was catching up with him and we were talking about our lives and careers. He’s struggling to make a living without much clear direction, I suggested he should become an engineer becasue the starting salaries are really good and you can build cool stuff. He’s a creative so it makes a lot of sense.</description>

      <link>https://www.toomas.net/2020/09/16/turtles-all-the-way-down/</link>
      <description>September 2020. I feel the wet, hardwood floor beneath my fingers. Summer air and water droplets touch my skin. My boots are strapped in and I am ready.




The guy gives me the signal. I tense up. He pulls a lever, and one second later I'm flying through the air.

      <title>Why did I lose the ability to co_await a std::future and concurrency::task? | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200916-00/?p=104227</link>
      <description>After upgrading to version 2.0.200729.8 of C++/WinRT, some customers reported that they lost the ability to co_await a std::future or a Concurrency::task. What happened? The relevant change is PR 702 which removed “vestigial support for free awaiters.” And that’s the part that’s relevant here.</description>

      <title>Integrating Thinkst Canaries with TheHive</title>
      <link>https://blog.reconinfosec.com/integrating-thinkst-canaries-with-thehive/</link>
      <description>We've been big fans of the Thinkst [https://canary.tools] platform for a while
now. We may have mentioned them a time or two :) Like many others, we get a lot
of mileage out of their Canaries and Canary Tokens.

We also love TheHive [https://thehive-project.org/], as you probably already
know. As we've long touted, it makes tracking incidents easy, it's reliable, and
it's another well-managed open source project that we support and contribute to.

Part of our job at Recon relies on both of these</description>
