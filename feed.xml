      <link>https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/dram/zenhammer/</link>
      <description>Our work shows that it is possible to trigger Rowhammer bit flips on DDR4 devices on AMD Zen 2 and Zen 3 systems despite deployed TRR mitigations. This result proves that AMD systems are equally vulnerable to Rowhammer as Intel systems, which greatly increases the attack surface, considering today’s AMD market share of around 36%… Read</description>

      <title>Notes on debugging HotSpot’s JIT compilation</title>
      <link>https://jornvernee.github.io/hotspot/jit/2023/08/18/debugging-jit.html</link>
      <description>Typically when you compile a Java program, it is first compiled into bytecode by a Java compiler. However, this bytecode is not optimized yet. In HotSpot (OpenJDK’s JVM) this instead happens at runtime, and is done by a JIT, a Just-In-Time compiler. This way of doing things allows the JIT to take maximum advantage of the conditions that the code is running in, such as hardware, and even to a certain degree the specific data that is fed into the program.</description>

Afterwards, these scripts are either refactored or they stay forever in the scripts graveyard</description>

      <title>ChatGPT 4 is worse than 3.5</title>
      <link>https://community.openai.com/t/chatgpt-4-is-worse-than-3-5/588078</link>
      <description>ChatGPT 4 is absolutely terrible for me, 90% of addons are giving out errors all the time and not working at all. Answers are extremely slow its not even translating all of my messages. The image feature is horrible, it doesnt recognize neither text or task on the image correctly. Conclusion: for 99% tasks gpt 3.5 is better and gpt 4 is raw, slow, buggy and useless.  20$ a month is TOO expensive for something that doesnt even work properly.</description>

      <title>Why choose async/await over threads?</title>
      <link>https://notgull.net/why-not-threads/</link>
      <description>A common refrain is that threads can do everything that async/await can, but simpler. So why would anyone choose async/await?</description>
