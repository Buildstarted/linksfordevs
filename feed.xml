      <title>Getting Things Done with LogSeq</title>
      <link>https://kshitij-banerjee.github.io/2024/02/16/getting-things-done-with-logseq/</link>
      <description>Introduction I was first introduced to the concept of “second-brain” from Tobi Lutke, the founder of Shopify. The topic started because someone asked whether he still codes - now that he is a founder of such a large company. Tobi went on to explain that he spent the weekend writing some code to customise Logseq to his preferences, and that he’s an active member of the Logseq community.
The following weekend, I setup Logseq and learnt its weird ways of working, and have since been an ardent user and fan of the Logseq/Obsidian methodology of building a “second-brain”</description>

      <title>Personalized arXiv Recommendation Service</title>
      <link>https://blog.haoxiang.org/2024/02/personalized-arxiv-recommendation-service/</link>
      <description>Surrendering to FOMO on important AI &amp;quot;breakthroughs&amp;quot;, I subscribed to Arxiv mailing list. Like all of the subscribers, I can&amp;#39;t read all the submissions in the daily email. To be completely honest, I simply archive the email from my inbox everyday without even opening the email at all. There is a slight chance that I try to browse through titles and abstracts one by one. But I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to read more than 10 abstracts. There are simply too many to read through.</description>

      <description>Replicate has been my default serverless GPU choice in the past, and I’ve been trying to use it to set up some embedding models, like SPLADE and a Q&amp;amp;A-optimized bi-encoder. On the other hand, I’m a huge fan of Fly for hosting, and they’ve just announced GPUs.</description>

      <title>My AirPods setup on Arch Linux</title>
      <link>https://mil.ad/blog/2024/airpods-on-arch.html</link>
      <description>Apple AirPods, and most modern Bluetooth headphones, can be paired to multiple devices at once. This is great because Bluetooth pairing is often a lengthy and involved process. However, when multiple paired devices are powered on and in the proximity of the headphone, it is not clear which device should, and will, take over the connection.</description>

      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/manually-migrate-zitadel-with-postgresql/</link>
      <description>As you, the reader, found this article, it is likely that you want to manually migrate the ZITADEL PostgreSQL database to a new version.
Now, normally this step is being done by the zitadel setup command with the --init-projections=true flag but, as we all know since &amp;amp;ldquo;2001: A Space Odyssey&amp;amp;rdquo;, computers can&amp;amp;rsquo;t be trusted - so you are either paranoid or something went terribly wrong.
For manually updating the database, we should first understand the structure a bit.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s been almost 2 years since I moved to a team lead role, then to a full-time engineering management position after the expansion of our team. I&amp;#39;ve been a front-end developer for 7 years before that, and initially I took the &amp;quot;advanced individual contributor&amp;quot; career track before doing the management turnaround. How&amp;#39;s it been? Bumpy, but fun. In this article, I&amp;#39;ll share the things I love and hate about my current job.</description>

      <title>Automated Unit Test Improvement using Large Language Models at Meta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09171</link>
      <description>This paper describes Meta&amp;#39;s TestGen-LLM tool, which uses LLMs to automatically improve existing human-written tests. TestGen-LLM verifies that its generated test classes successfully clear a set of filters that assure measurable improvement over the original test suite, thereby eliminating problems due to LLM hallucination. We describe the deployment of TestGen-LLM at Meta test-a-thons for the Instagram and Facebook platforms. In an evaluation on Reels and Stories products for Instagram, 75% of TestGen-LLM&amp;#39;s test cases built correctly, 57% passed reliably, and 25% increased coverage. During Meta&amp;#39;s Instagram and Facebook test-a-thons, it improved 11.5% of all classes to which it was applied, with 73% of its recommendations being accepted for production deployment by Meta software engineers. We believe this is the first report on industrial scale deployment of LLM-generated code backed by such assurances of code improvement.</description>
