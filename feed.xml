      <title>Retrieving Images from the Clipboard and WPF Image Control Woes</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Sep/16/Retrieving-Images-from-the-Clipboard-and-WPF-Image-Control-Woes</link>
      <description>Retrieving images from the clipboard with WPF seems so simple, but once you get into it you'll find that there are lots of problems with reliable image retrieval that works for all images. In this post I talk about the different issues you're likely to run into and one hacky  but flexible solution to better image support by selectively sniffing image formats and using different clipboard retrievals based on the image format.</description>

      <link>https://www.infoq.com/articles/azure-spring-boot-serverles-dubois/</link>
      <description>Microsoft seems to prove over and over again its focus on cloud and the Java ecosystem is the new normal. Even though Java is amongst the supported languages for Azure functions for some time now, Julien Dubois experimented with Spring Boot and Azure to see what this combination means for Azure serverless computing. InfoQ reached out to him to explore further his experience on this topic.</description>

      <title>10 Tips for Ramping Up as a Senior Engineer</title>
      <link>https://jdxcode.com/posts/2020-09-16-10-tips-ramping-up-as-a-senior-engineer/</link>
      <description>I've learned the hard way that starting a job on a large engineering team as a senior engineeer is more than simply writing good code. You have to drive initiatives at a social level and not simply because you know more about the codebase.
For a new hire this is especially a challenge. You need to learn the system that your colleagues already understand. You might be a higher level but you'll be a worse engineer for the first few months while you ramp up.</description>

He’s a creative so it makes a lot of sense.</description>

      <description>After upgrading to version 2.0.200729.8 of C++/WinRT, some customers reported that they lost the ability to co_await a std::future or a Concurrency::task. What happened? The relevant change is PR 702 which removed “vestigial support for free awaiters.” And that’s the part that’s relevant here.</description>

We also love TheHive [https://thehive-project.org/], as you probably already
know. As we've long touted, it makes tracking incidents easy, it's reliable, and
it's another well-managed open source project that we support and contribute to.

Part of our job at Recon relies on both of these</description>
