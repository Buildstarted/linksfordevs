      <description>The greatest gift I can give my kids is a love of technology.

      <title>Good Design is Imperfect Design Part 1: Honest Names - Domain Language</title>
      <link>https://www.domainlanguage.com/articles/good-design-is-imperfect-design-part-1-honest-names/</link>
      <description>by Eric Evans Perfectionism is a pitfall. For those who, like me, love elegant design and see its utility, there is a slippery slope waiting when a satisfying design does not emerge in a reasonable time. It takes constant self-discipline to recognize this and accept, let go, ship and move on – or return in...</description>

      <title>Tip 327 - How to use Azure Service Bus Queues</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip327.html</link>
      <description>Modern applications are made up of many components and services. For instance, you might have a web application that users use to order items from a shop. The web application uses an API that runs in an Azure Function (opens new window) to process the order. This works well, until the Azure Function is offline. To make sure that your application stays available, and that the web application and backend APIs can scale independently, you can decouple them with a queue. Azure Service Bus Queues (opens new window) provides a queue that helps with this.</description>

      <title>Why Don’t Tech Companies Pay Their Engineers to Stay?</title>
      <link>https://www.goethena.com/post/why-don-t-tech-companies-pay-their-engineers-to-stay</link>
      <description>Staying in a role builds valuable, company-specific domain knowledge. Leaving often results in a pay day. This article was originally published to Marker. Too soon When news broke that breakout star Reg&amp;#233;-Jean Page was leaving Bridgerton after only one season, my initial reaction was that of shock and heartbreak. I couldn’t fathom why Netflix and The Duke of Hastings weren’t able to come to some sort of agreement. But then it hit me: my entire career, I’ve watched talented engineers leave compani</description>

      <title>Infra as a Code Is Cloud Lock-In</title>

      <description>I’m a big fan of using IaaC tooling in all of my DevOps jobs. It’s a great pleasure to be able to define your infrastructure in a code and exactly know what do you have in your cloud. It helps you avoid the situation where you have to ask people in the company to know where something lives. You can simply CTRL+F through the project (assuming you store it in a single repo) and you always know where something is.</description>

      <title>SAML is insecure by design</title>
      <link>https://joonas.fi/2021/08/saml-is-insecure-by-design/</link>
      <description>What is SAML?  Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties.
 Source: Wikipedia
SAML is often used for single-sign on (“Sign in with Google”, “Sign in with Twitter” etc.). It means when you want to log in to example.com, example.com can trust &amp;amp; use an external authentication provider to assert the user’s identity for you. SAML is about communicating these authentication &amp;amp; identity details across organization boundaries (web domains).</description>

      <title>Coding Shorts: Changes to Coming to Startup in .NET 6 
</title>
      <link>https://wildermuth.com/2021/08/04/Coding-Shorts-Changes-to-Coming-to-Startup-in--NET-6/</link>
      <description>.NET 6 Preview 6 is here. One of the big changes I&amp;#39;m looking forward to is how startup is changing. With this change, comes &amp;quot;Minimal APIs&amp;quot; too. While getting rid of the Startup class is a welcome change, I&amp;#39;m a little less excited about how Minimal APIs might be over-used.

      <description>By using PostgREST with Postgres, we can build REST API-based applications. In particular, it&amp;#39;s an excellent fit for Cloudflare Workers, our serverless function platform. Workers is a great place to build REST APIs.</description>
