      <title>Dutch cities want to ban property investors in all neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://nltimes.nl/2021/09/02/dutch-cities-want-ban-property-investors-neighborhoods</link>
      <description>The large municipalities in the Netherlands plan to make wide use of a legislative amendment that will allow them to designate neighborhoods where investors won&amp;#39;t be allowed to buy cheap and medium-priced homes and rent them out, NOS found after surveying the municipalities.&amp;#160;

This legislative amendment is expected to take effect on January 1. The intention is to give people looking for a home a better chance of finding one on the tight Dutch housing market. Last year, a third of all homes sold in the four large cities were bought by investors.&amp;#160;</description>

      <description>I am sure, you must have heard of Proxy and reverse proxy server. This is a very important topic, when we talk about backend engineering &amp;amp; computer networking. Some times it&amp;#39;s very confusing to find the exact difference between both of them.</description>

      <title>List of Gaming Laptops with MUX Switch - Jarrod&amp;#39;s Tech</title>
      <link>https://jarrods.tech/list-of-gaming-laptops-with-mux-switch/</link>
      <description>It is important to know whether a gaming laptop has a MUX switch before buying it, because this feature lets you disable optimus and get a speed boost in games. About This List This list only includes gaming laptops that I have personally tested and verified as having a MUX switch. Unfortunately I have not tested every single model from every generation, however generally if say a 10th gen MSI GE66 has a MUX switch, I’d say it’s usually pretty safe to assume that the newer 11th gen version has it too – though this may not always be the case. It’s more common for this feature to be added in a newer model if it wasn’t there previously than for a company to remove it, but of course check laptop reviews where ever possible to confirm. Please note that some models with the same name may or may not have a MUX switch, unfortunately it can be confusing and difficult to determine. Likewise, it can also depend on the specs of the laptop itself. For example, the ASUS Zephyrus S17 with 4K screen does NOT have a MUX switch, while the 1440p model does have one. The Acer Triton 500 with RTX 2060 graphics does not have a MUX switch, while the higher end 2080 model does, so specs can matter too which is why I’ve listed these as well. How To Use This Data All laptops are sorted in alphabetical order. You can click the column headers to instead list all laptops that do or do not have a MUX switch, or simply search the model in the search box.</description>

      <title>Launching Visual Studio Code cleanly from a .NET Application</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2021/Sep/03/Launching-VS-Code-cleanly-from-a-NET-Application</link>
      <description>Visual Studio Code has become the mainstay editor for many developers. If you have developer focused applications and you need to externally display text or code content, it would be very useful to pop open VS Code to display external text/code content. This sounds simple enough, but Code both on Windows and Mac has some peculiar launch behaviors that make this a little more tricky than you might think, especially if you need to make sure that you can do it across platforms. </description>

      <title>Snowball sampling bias in program evaluation</title>
      <link>https://bldavies.com/blog/snowball-sampling-bias-program-evaluation/</link>
      <description>Suppose I want to run a pilot study of a mental health support program before rolling it out at scale.
The program has heterogeneous treatment effects, but tends to be more effective for people who have fewer social connections.
Such people tend to have lower mental health (Kawachi and Berkman, 2001) and so have more to gain from participating in the program.</description>

      <description>In tech, switching jobs almost always comes with either a financial or a title upside. However, it doesn’t always come with both. Switching for higher compensation can result in a “lower” title, like going from Senior Software Engineer to SWE 2 or VP Engineering to Senior Engineering Manager. This</description>
