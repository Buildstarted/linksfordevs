      <title>What punch cards teach us about AI risk – The Observation Deck</title>
      <link>https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2023/11/26/what-punch-cards-teach-us-about-ai-risk/</link>
      <description>I (finally) read Edwin Black’s IBM and the Holocaust, and I can’t recommend it strongly enough.  This book had been on my queue for years, and I put it off for the same reason that you have probably put it off:  we don’t like to confront difficult things.  But the book is superlative:  not only is it fascinating and well-researched but given the current level of anxiety about the consequences of technological development, it feels especially timely.  Black makes clear in his preface that IBM did not cause the Holocaust (unequivocally, the Holocaust would have happened without IBM), but he also makes clear in the book that information management was essential to every aspect of the Nazi war machine — and that that information management  was made possible through IBM equipment and (especially) their punch cards.</description>

      <title>Announcing the first Arecibo release</title>
      <link>https://blog.lurk-lang.org/posts/arecibo-supernova/</link>
      <description>()  We’re happy to announce the first crate release of Arecibo, our fork of Nova. Arecibo is intended to be an “incubation project” for Nova, testing out implementations of improvements to the Nova folding framework, and back-contributing these changes to the upstream project. Please consider that as a project meant to evolve quickly, it makes few guarantees of backward-compatibility, and that the Arecibo-specific changes have not been reviewed by the Nova maintainers.</description>
