      <title>Andrew: Loving someone with depression</title>
      <link>https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/stories/andrew-loving-someone-depression</link>
      <description>Depression is devastating. When someone is experiencing depression, their entire life is blown apart. It can be a massive struggle just to make it through each day. But they aren&amp;#39;t the only ones who struggle. Often forgotten are the loved ones of a person with depression. No-one tells them how to cope. They don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I would like to try and offer some advice to those people. Knowing somebody you love is struggling with depression leaves you feeling incredibly helpless.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s been quiet around here, and that&amp;#39;s for a reason. Blogging is just one thing on my to-do list, and it&amp;#39;s pretty low on that list. But there&amp;#39;s more to it. It&amp;#39;s not just about making time to write something but also about staying motivated.</description>

      <title>Fixing stutters in Papers Please on Linux – Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.jhm.dev/posts/papers-please/</link>
      <description>Since I switched to Linux some time ago, I had my fair share of problems with running games on Linux. To be fair, most of these were not designed to run on linux, but the awesome Proton and its main project wine make it easy to run most games I am interested in seamlessly. Most of the time, games refuse to start, but some workaround exists to make it run.</description>
