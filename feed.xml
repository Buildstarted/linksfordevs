      <title>Generating HTTP API clients using dotnet tools and Visual Studio Connected Services</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/generating-http-api-clients-using-dotnet-tools/</link>
      <description>This article discuss about generating HTTP API clients using dotnet tools and Visual Studio Connected Services. From .NET 5.0 onwards ASP.NET Core Web API template comes with Open API support. So when you create a new web api project, Open API is enabled by default. To generate client you can use dotnet CLI and Visual Studio. So firstly you need to create a ASP.NET Core Web API project. And verify swagger is enabled and it is working as expected. Next you can look into the client generation options.</description>

      <title>Creating other types of synchronization objects that can be used with co_await, part 2: The basic library | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210310-00/?p=104945</link>
      <description>Last time, I teased a library for building awaitable synchronization objects. It builds on the code had earlier written for one-shot events by distilling the pattern to its essence and then rebuilding it in a more generic way. We start with the linked list nodes which are used to keep track of coroutines who are waiting for the synchronization object.</description>

      <title>A Git security release</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/848893/</link>
      <description>Several new versions of the Git source-code management system have been
released; they fix a vulnerability that could allow a hostile remote
repository to execute code locally during a clone operation.  
Only users with case-insensitive filesystems are affected, reducing
the set of possible targets considerably, but an update still seems like a
good idea.</description>
