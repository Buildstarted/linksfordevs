      <title>Mapping out the tribes of climate</title>
      <link>https://nadia.xyz/climate-tribes</link>
      <description>Climate is a gravity well for talent, but why don’t other, equally impactful topics attract talent in the same way? Why isn’t everyone dropping everything to work on homelessness, or global poverty, or curing cancer? With many peers in tech now working on climate issues, I tried to understand why this topic holds such purchase for so many people – and its incredible staying power over the decades.</description>

      <title>Secure your servers by blocking off sshd</title>
      <link>https://timothya.com/blog/ssh/</link>
      <description>Creating a computer in the cloud is easy, securing it is not. The general approach is to block all inbound access to all ports except the ones that your webserver and sshd are running on. This approach can get you quite far, but you’re still going to have lots of requests from bad actors trying to find a way in. Tools exist to help you by monitoring auth logs and applying filters, but they’re reactive, and have limited utility as a preventative measure.</description>

      <title>The Content Machine Revolution &amp;#183; Notes</title>
      <link>https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2022/content-machine-revolution/</link>
      <description>There is a revolution happening on the Internet and you haven&amp;amp;amp;rsquo;t noticed it. That&amp;amp;amp;rsquo;s okay, that&amp;amp;amp;rsquo;s the point. Artificial intelligences (AIs) capable of producing readable and coherent text, incredible images, and even videos are among us and already create much of the content that appears in our wanderings around the web and on social media.
We are living the machine revolution — of content.
Systems like OpenAI&amp;amp;amp;rsquo;s GPT-3 create long form text from commands or short sentences.</description>

      <title>Exploring generating PDF files from HTML in ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/364/exploring-generating-pdf-files-from-html-in-asp-net-core</link>
      <description>Back in 2008, I wrote a 
series of articles 
about using iTextSharp to generate PDF files in an ASP.NET application. I 
still use iTextSharp in a large MVC 5 application that I&amp;#39;m in the process of

migrating to ASP.NET Core. The version I use is very old (4.1.6), and the 
API is very low level so it takes quite a while to write the code required to generate 
even a moderately complex PDF. Ideally I need a replacement for the new 
application that can generate PDF files purely from HTML, which is an API I&amp;#39;m 
much more comfortable with. This ancient version of iTextSharp doesn&amp;#39;t support 
HTML as a source of content. In this article, I consider some alternatives.</description>
