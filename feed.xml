      <description>When building ASP.NET Core backends for SPA applications one thing that you have to worry about is how to handle client side routes that end up being fired against the server through external or reloaded links. While ASp.NET Core has built-in support for this if you build a generic Web server, you might need a little more control on how to handle the Fallback routing functionality. Here's how.</description>

      <description>We are constantly dealing with libraries and NuGet packages. These libraries depend on other popular libraries and there are a lot of shared dependencies. With a large enough web of dependencies, you'll eventually get into conflicts or hard situations. The best way to deal with such issues is to understand how the mechanism works internally.</description>

      <description>The AirPods Pro “Rattlegate”
The first generation of the AirPods was generally regarded as a perfect product. “Apple at its best!” was the universally accepted opinion.
I used them for a long time. No speaker issues, no battery issues.
Excited for the noise cancelling feature I ordered the AirPods Pro and for the first few months everything was fine. One day the left AirPod started buzzing every time I was moving my head.</description>

      <title>A $50.000/year streaming service | Gianluca Mauro</title>
      <link>https://blog.gianlucamauro.com/post/harvard-online-learning/</link>
      <description>Harvard University announced that next academic year will be 100% online.
And the tuition won’t be a dime cheaper.
Why does it matter?
I don’t want to question the worthiness of such an investment. Yet, I can’t help but wonder if you’ll loose some of your returns by switching from the Harvard University halls to your web browser.
When you give $50.000 to a University like Harvard, you’re paying for a bunch of stuff.</description>
