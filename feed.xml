      <description>Where C# is the most dominant language in the .NET world, other languages are built on top of the Framework that deserves their respective place.

      <title>An Indie Hacker’s Idea Sieve</title>
      <link>https://shubhamjain.co/2023/08/01/indie-hackers-idea-sieve/</link>
      <description>I believe it&amp;#39;s critical to know what you like working on. What can, ultimately, provide long-term satisfaction for yourself? In the context of side projects, the perk of knowing it loud and clear is that it creates a mental filter to weed out bad ideas. All my projects, so far, have had the same trajectory: get excited about the idea, ship it, enjoy some attention, and soon enough, get bored with it. After the peak, the loss of excitement is so much that I find it painful to work on it again. </description>

      <link>https://www.danstroot.com/posts/2023-08-01-chatgpt-4-is-more-creative-than-you</link>
      <description>We think that generative AI creativity is limited by its training data and algorithms, and therefore can produce technically proficient content, but not truly novel and innovative content. We like to believe that our own creativity and innovation, rooted in personal experience, knowledge, and human emotions results in intentionality and emotional depth that cannot be replicated by AI. Current research contradicts that view.</description>

      <title>Azure DevOps Podcast: Giorgi Dalakishvili: Beyond Relational Data with Entity Framework - Episode 255</title>
      <link>http://feed.azuredevops.show/giorgi-dalakishvili-beyond-relational-data-with-entity-framework-episode-255</link>
      <description>Giorgi Dalakishvili is a software developer with more than a decade of experience. He works mainly with C#,  MVC/ Core, REST, WCF, Xamarin, Android, iOS, Entity Framework, Azure, SQL Server, and Oracle. &amp;amp;nbsp; Giorgi is an open-source author and contributor on GitHub and a member of the .NET Foundation and InfoQ Editor. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [3:33] Giorgi has worked with all the frameworks and libraries that Microsoft has come out with over the past 10‒15 years. He discusses using Entity Framework and starting his small speaking engagements. [5:12]  is a website where you can put out some different topics that you’d be willing to speak on, and just reach out to different user groups to take the plunge and do some public speaking for the first time. [6:03] Other types of data with Entity Framework beyond relational data, such as hierarchical data type from SQL Server. [8:49] How it simplifies your life. [9:28] What about JSON? Are there any limitations on the back-end database? [13:00] Is the support in EF Core 7.0 good enough to give a try if you’re going against SQL Server? [14:09] What other types of data are interesting to work with with Entity Framework? [14:36] Using geospatial data. What does it even look like? [18:30] Full text search, and how it’s different from a regular text search. [23:20] There are a lot of features to uncover in relational databases that we aren’t even aware of yet. [26:22] There are some problems and some tasks that are better solved with non-relational databases, but the majority can overlap between the two systems. &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episodes:     — New Video Podcast!

      <title>Superconductor Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_{6O}$ showing levitation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037</link>
      <description>A material called LK-99, a modified-lead apatite crystal structure with the
composition Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_{6O}$ ($0.9&amp;lt;x&amp;lt;1.1$), has been
synthesized using the solid-state method. The material exhibits the Ohmic metal
characteristic of Pb(6s1) above its superconducting critical temperature,
$T_c$, and the levitation phenomenon as Meissner effect of a superconductor at
room temperature and atmospheric pressure below $T_c$. A LK-99 sample shows
$T_c$ above 126.85$^	rc$C (400 K). We analyze that the possibility of
room-temperature superconductivity in this material is attributed to two
factors: the first being the volume contraction resulting from an
insulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and the second
being on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by the structural
deformation in the one-dimensional(D) chain (Pb2-O$_{1/2}$-Pb2 along the
c-axis) structure owing to superconducting condensation at $T_c$. The mechanism
of the room-temperature $T_c$ is discussed by 1-D BR-BCS theory.</description>

      <title>Origin of correlated isolated flat bands in copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16892</link>
      <description>A recent report of room temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure in
Cu-substituted apatite (`LK99&amp;#39;) has invigorated interest in the understanding
of what materials and mechanisms can allow for high-temperature
superconductivity. Here I perform density functional theory calculations on
Cu-substituted lead phosphate apatite, identifying correlated isolated flat
bands at the Fermi level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in
already established families of superconductors. I elucidate the origins of
these isolated bands as arising from a structural distortion induced by the Cu
ions and a chiral charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs. These results
suggest that a minimal two-band model can encompass much of the low-energy
physics in this system. Finally, I discuss the implications of my results on
possible superconductivity in Cu-doped apatite</description>

      <title>Semiconducting transport in Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16802</link>
      <description>The very recent claim on the discovery of ambient-pressure room-temperature
superconductivity in modified lead-apatite has immediately excited sensational
attention in the entire society, which is fabricated by sintering lanarkite
(Pb2SO5) and copper(I) phosphide (Cu3P). To verify this exciting claim, we have
successfully synthesized Pb2SO5, Cu3P, and finally the modified lead-apatite
Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O. Detailed electrical transport and magnetic properties of
these compounds were systematically analyzed. It turns out that Pb2SO5 is a
highly insulating diamagnet with a room-temperature resistivity of ~7.18x10^9
Ohm.cm and Cu3P is a paramagnetic metal with a room-temperature resistivity of
~5.22x10^-4 Ohm.cm. In contrast to the claimed superconductivity, the resulting
Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O compound sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P exhibits
semiconductor-like transport behavior with a large room-temperature resistivity
of ~1.94x10^4 Ohm.cm although our compound shows greatly consistent x-ray
diffraction spectrum with the previously reported structure data. In addition,
when a pressed Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O pellet is located on top of a commercial
Nd2Fe14B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic
levitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of a
room-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more careful
re-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties.</description>
