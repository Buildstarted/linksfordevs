      <description>Cyber-attacks have become a reality of running software on the web today. We find ourselves under a constant barrage of malicious activity from hacktivists, online criminals and increasingly, nation states. Successful attacks from these adversaries are predominantly via flaws in the software products they target – flaws that could have been prevented by developers understanding how online attackers work and what the appropriate defensive measures are. </description>

      <link>https://developer.nvidia.com/gtc/2020/video/s22698</link>
      <description>In this talk, Edward Liu from NVIDIA Applied Deep Learning Research delves into the latest research progress on Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), which uses deep learning and the NVIDIA Tensor Cores to reconstruct super sampled frames in real-time. He discusses and demonstrates why scaling and image reconstruction for real-time rendering is an extremely challenging problem, and examines the cause of common artifacts produced by traditional up-sampling techniques.</description>

      <title>libgit2 v1.0 Released</title>
      <link>https://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/libgit2_v1.html</link>
      <description>After many years of planning, writing code, and fixing bugs, libgit2 v1.0 has been released.  🎉🎉🎉  libgit2 is a linkable library for working with git repositories in any application, and you probably interact with the library, even if you don't know it.  That's because libgit2 powers your applications and your hosting provider, whether you use GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or nearly anybody else.  The Git community – really, every software developer – depends on libgit2.  And we've finally released libgit2 v1.0.</description>
