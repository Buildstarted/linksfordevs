      <title>House of Nettles • A Non-Technical Intro to Webmentions</title>
      <link>https://nex-3.com/blog/a-non-technical-intro-to-webmentions/</link>
      <description>I keep bringing up &amp;quot;Webmentions&amp;quot; in the context of discussing the sociable web and advocating for more people to adopt more social technologies on their websites, but I always run into a wall: there&amp;#39;s no good place to link people to so they can understand more about what that means. All the existing explanations I&amp;#39;ve found are deep in the weeds of how Webmentions work on a technical level, which isn&amp;#39;t a very helpful place to start for people who just want to post.

I want to fill that gap with this post, and give people who don&amp;#39;t know the ins and outs of HTTP a working understanding of what Webmentions do and how to get them up and running for your site. To that end:

Webmentions are a way to let a website know that you linked to it.

That&amp;#39;s it! At it&amp;#39;s core, it&amp;#39;s just that simple. If…</description>

      <title>Hetzner Considered Hostile: A PSA - Ten Forward&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://tenforward.blog/hetzner-considered-hostile-a-psa/</link>
      <description>On 8 October 2024 I received an email from Hetzner. This was a forwarded abuse report. As is standard practice in the web hosting business Hetzner forwarded this to me so I could take action on it. This was no ordinary abuse report. This was targeted harassment from a threat actor that has been harassing me and my friends for a long time. Now they have started targeting Ten Forward itself in an attempt to cause disruption in the day to day operations of Ten Forward.</description>

      <description>Ever seen this keyboard? This was called the Datahand, it was a radical new approach to keyboards that mostly only existed within a small community of RSI sufferers. It cost $2,000 in 1993, which is north of $4,000 today, so you really had to need this thing to justify the price. Even now there&amp;amp;rsquo;s a small community that continues to use these.
For a long time after Datahand shut down production, there was no real replacement.</description>

      <title>Datetime Made Easy with This ONE C# Dapper Trick!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=84pgpQAHv2k</link>
      <description>DateTime, DateTimeOffset, and... well, ANYTHING with dates, times, and time zones can be a huge pain in the butt in DotNet.

DateTimeOffset has made some of this stuff feel much better in our applications because it can carry around with it the time zone offset along with the DateTime itself. Awesome!

But have you found in your applications that you&amp;#39;re writing UTC DateTimes to databases and then reading those DateTimes back?

If you&amp;#39;re not careful, you&amp;#39;ll lose the implicit UTC time zone information. But there&amp;#39;s a handy trick we can use with Dapper as we&amp;#39;ll see in this tutorial!

      <title>3 Things That CATAPULTED My Software Engineering Journey</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=oWO2jn_Nrug</link>
