      <description>You are much closer to sleeping on the streets than sleeping in the mansion of a billionaire. And the envious desire to sleep in the mansion of the billionaire is what is destroying our environment. We have allowed the greedy and cruel to dominate and their insatiable greed and cruelty will inevitably lead to environmental destruction.Billionaires ...</description>

      <title>Attacks on machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2024/01/07/attacking-neural-networks.html</link>
      <description>With all the hype surrounding machine learning whether its with self driving cars or LLMs, there is a big elephant in the room which not a lot of people are talking about. Its not the danger of ChatGPT taking your jobs or deepfakes or the singularity. Its instead about how neural networks can be attacked. This blog post is my attempt to throw some light on the topic. By the end of the post, you would have understood that neural network attacks are not just limited to adversarial examples and that they are just as susceptible to attacks like other systems. If you are deploying machine learning systems in production, I think its worth paying attention to this topic.</description>

      <title>Why Not RSS?</title>
      <link>https://awakari.com/articles/why-not-rss.html</link>
      <description>What do services offer instead of RSS?
                They want people to allow push notifications or subscribe by email.
                The problem is that people actually hate this way.
                We&amp;#39;d never allow notifications from services and sites.
                We always try to avoid leaving our email for a subscription purpose.</description>

      <title>TIOBE Index - TIOBE</title>
      <link>https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/</link>
      <description>For the first time in the history of the TIOBE index, C# has won the programming language of the year award. Congratulations! C# has been a top 10 player for more than 2 decades and now that it is catching up with the big 4 languages, it won the well-deserved award by being the language with the biggest uptick in one year (+1.43%). Runners up are Scratch (+0.83%) and Fortran (+0.64%). C# is eating market share from Java and is getting more and more popular in domains such as web application back ends and games (thanks to Unity). C# can be used free of charge and evolves in a steady pace, making the language more expressive every new release. C# is here to stay and might even surpass Java soon.</description>

      <title>Weird things engineers believe about Web development</title>
      <link>https://birtles.blog/2024/01/06/weird-things-engineers-believe-about-development/</link>
      <description>I wrote most of this post sometime in 2022 but I think it holds up alright in 2024 so I decided to publish it for posterity. I don’t really like doing posts like this—I’d much rather share some innocuous learnings or tips but it turns out I have opinions too &amp;#128531; Sorry! Since I quit Mozilla and went back to full-time Web development, I’ve discovered a few surprises. It turns out Web development is actually pretty hard, Web developers are actually very smart, and some of these frameworks and techniques we mocked as browser engineers aren’t so bad. Oops. At the same time, it turns out some Web developers have ideas about browsers and the Web that, as a former browser engineer and standards editor, I’m a bit dubious of. Here are a few of the things that surprised me.</description>
