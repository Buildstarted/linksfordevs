      <title>Eigensolutions: composability as the antidote to overfit • Lea Verou</title>
      <link>https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/eigensolutions/?latest=</link>
      <description>tl;dr:
Overfitting happens when solutions don’t generalize sufficiently and is a hallmark of poor design.
Eigensolutions are the opposite: solutions that generalize so much they expose links between seemingly unrelated use cases.
Designing eigensolutions takes a mindset shift from linear design to composability.</description>

      <description>When you&amp;#39;re constantly producing things like toys and code, mistakes will happen. Some will be easy to spot and others may elude you. Santa knows that attention to detail counts. The elves know that if Santa finds a typo in their documentation or their code, he will immediately ask himself what else may be wrong. In order to avoid the impression of carelessness, the elves have automated the finding and fixing of typos.</description>

      <description>Image Generation AIs are proving to be very good at creating images that can be used for all sorts of purposes. In this article I discuss how you can integrate image generation right into your own .NET applications using the OpenAI REST API. In addition I&amp;#39;ll show how you can integrated this functionality into a larger application and discuss some general thoughts on image AI usage based on some of the experiences from a developer/non-designer user perspective.</description>
