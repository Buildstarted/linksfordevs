      <title>Preventing Insecure Network Connections | Apple Developer Documentation</title>
      <link>https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preventing_insecure_network_connections</link>
      <description>On Apple platforms, a networking security feature called App Transport Security (ATS) improves privacy and data integrity for all apps and app extensions. It does this by requiring that network connections made by your app are secured by the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol using reliable certificates and ciphers. ATS blocks connections that don’t meet minimum security requirements.</description>

      <description>One of the most-cited vegan athlete success stories is of Carl Lewis, who credits his outstanding 1991 results in part to the vegan diet he adopted in 1990.(1) He says something that is often quoted in vegan propaganda, “My best year of track competition was the first year I ate a vegan diet.” The biohacker in […]</description>

      <title>What is the Value of Browser Diversity?</title>
      <link>https://daverupert.com/2020/09/the-value-of-browser-diversity/</link>
      <description>In May 2019 I attended a talk by Mike Taylor who works on webcompat at Mozilla. Mike told the sordid story of window.event, a non-standard IE invention that was replicated in Konqueror, which showed up in Webkit, which stuck around in Blink, and was now Mike’s problem in Firefox. It was a good story fraught with ups and downs and literal “Breaking the Web” level changes for a tiny feature rollout.</description>

      <title>10+ Sorts, Visualized - Disparity Cube  (Radix, Gravity, Quicksort, ...)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsSu0LQmhY8</link>
      <description>Visualization of 12 different Sorting Algorithms as a Cube with sound.

✅ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/CompilerStuck?sub_confirmation=1

Each dot, representing a part of the Cube has its own color. 
If it is swapped with another dot, its size changes according to how far it is away from its original position. Large Ball = Org. Pos. , Small Ball = Pos far away

Time Stamps:
00:00 Merge Sort
00:33 Gravity (Bead) Sort
00:45 Radix Sort (Base 10)
01:00 Cycle Sort
01:15 Heap Sort
01:40 Selection Sort
01:55 Quick Sort (Dual Pivot)
02:15 Shell Sort
02:37 Quick Sort (Pivot Middle)
02:50 Double Selection Sort
03:02 Comb Sort
03:51 Counting Sort
04:05 Comparison Table


Measurements explained: 
As "Comparison" counts the comparison of a value from the Array with any other value.
As "Segment" counts every sorted part of the array.
"Real Time" corresponds to the measured time only used for the algorithm.
As "Swap" counts the exchange between the indexes of two elements of the array.
As "Write to the Main Array" counts the change of a value in the Array.

Please put your wished and questions in the comments.  :)</description>
