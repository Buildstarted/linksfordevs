      <title>Important message from Crypto Dave</title>
      <link>https://thislayoffdoesnotexist.com/</link>
      <description>Crypto sent the following email to Sennheiser employees earlier today.

Greetings, fellow Sennheisers! It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you that we have been forced to make the difficult decision of laying off 15% of our staff.

It’s been a long and hard road trying to make sure the company is prepared for the future and unfortunately, we have been unable to achieve this. Our ambition was to get “all-in” on the cryptocurrency market, with the goal of providing our products to a wider audience and expanding our reach. Unfortunately, due to external factors, our plans were not successful and we have been left with no choice but to take this difficult decision.</description>

      <title>Open Peer Review Considered Harmful?</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2023/peer_review/</link>
      <description>Peer review, one of the staples of modern research, has a somewhat
weird reputation: on the one hand, society recognises that there should
be a way to assess the correctness of scientific claims.1 On the other
hand, researchers are loath to relinquish control to their peers, who,
typically, provide anonymous feedback. This latter opinion is typically
justified by explaining that the incentives2 are not in favour of the
authors here: the default position for many journals and many
conferences seems to be ‘reject unless proven to be sufficiently good,’
meaning that it is much easier for reviewers to suggest
rejection than to engage with the content in a meaningful manner.</description>

      <description>Over the past few years, I’ve seen something that kind of troubles me. While people on iPhones Write books on using the iPhone on their iPhones, clear out their Email on their Apple Watch and manage the rest on their iPhones, and use their iPhones as their primary computing devices, Android users feel like one cannot be productive on any mobile system. So, here’s the thing. When you are around sighted people, even at a job sometimes, what are they using?</description>

      <title>How to Efficiently Reorder or Rerank Items in Database - Yasoob Khalid</title>
      <link>https://yasoob.me/posts/how-to-efficiently-reorder-or-rerank-items-in-database/</link>
      <description>I was once thinking about Trello and Jira and wondered how they implemented the sorting functionality in their drag &amp;amp; drop interface. You can have a million items/cards and both of these platforms will allow you to change the order in a simple drag and drop manner and efficiently update their position in the database.
How could I implement such a system? It was hard to do research on this topic because most queries returned results from blogs that showed how to implement a drag and drop component using React DnD and similar libraries but did not show how to persist the new order in a database.</description>
