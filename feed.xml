      <title>IP-Link – Twelve years after – cedric&amp;#39;s blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.cedricbonhomme.org/2022/01/27/ip-link-twelve-years-after/</link>
      <description>It is now about twelve years that I maintain IP-Link. No big new features since recently but the code is still working well, evolving and using up-to-date libraries. Even better, I am now using Pypacker for the parsing of the network captures. It’s a quite a cool improvement. The parsing is way faster than before, like wayyyyyy faster!</description>

      <title>Speeding up VSCode (extensions) in 2022 – Jason Williams</title>
      <link>https://jason-williams.co.uk/speeding-up-vscode-extensions-in-2022</link>
      <description>I was curious to know if the functionality of VSCode can catch up with the native speed of some editors, such as Sublime. That led me to seek out where some bottlenecks may be and where time is being spent. In this post I look at both the internals and extensions. VSCode has a broad […]</description>

      <title>Please Don’t Just Say Hello In Chat</title>
      <link>https://sbmueller.github.io/nohello/</link>
      <description>Modern chat communication should be done in a way that saves time for all participants and enables an efficient, asynchronous exchange of information. Don’t expect an answer if you just write “Hello” in chat. Instead, phrase a message that allows your chat partners to provide a meaningful response as soon as they allocate time to read and answer your message.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, the Office and Management and Budget (OMB) released a memo:“Moving the U.S. Government Towards Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles”. The memo advises the Federal Government on what steps each agency must take to improve its cybersecurity. It looks like the government is planning to position itself as a cybersecurity leader, while also pushing the private sector into a more robust cybersecurity posture.&amp;#160;Also, if you get into it, this memo is actually about a lot more than zero trust.</description>

      <title>Prefer to change the code rather than write a workaround</title>
      <link>https://catern.com/change_code.html</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;m talking about situations where you know how to solve your problem,
but you&amp;#39;ve chosen to implement that solution in some additional layer of code on top,
rather than changing the original problematic code.
As
has
been
expressed
many
times
before,
code is a liability;
the more code you have, the worse off you are.
So just change the original problematic code instead!</description>

      <link>https://phillipcarter.dev/posts/big-company-bullshit/</link>
      <description>When I worked for Microsoft, I regularly talked directly to users and customers of the software I worked on. Because nobody tells you each time their code compiles successfully, I’d usually hear from them when things were broken or unsatisfying. Most of these problems would be straightforward - we messed up and regressed something, there was a latent bug in the system someone found, we hadn’t implemented a feature that someone thinks is really important, and so on.</description>
