      <title>Questions to Consider Before A Collaboration - Tasshin</title>
      <link>https://tasshin.com/blog/questions-to-consider-before-a-collaboration/</link>
      <description>It’s relatively easy to propose a collaboration: “Hey, we could work on something together!” But in my experience, it takes considerable thought, care, and effort to structure a collaboration so that it’s a fun, useful, win-win exercise. In other words, there’s an art to collaboration. You probably have a number of people U might enjoy</description>

      <title>Consider using array operators over the SQL in operator</title>
      <link>https://kaveland.no/posts/2024-09-21-equals-any-over-where-in</link>
      <description>In my post about batch operations, I used the where id = any(:ids) pattern, with ids bound to a JDBC array. I’ve gotten questions about that afterwards, asking why I do it like that, instead of using in (:id1, :id2, ...). Many libraries can take care of the dynamic SQL generation for you, so often you can just write in (:ids), just like the array example. I would still prefer to use the = any(:ids) pattern, and I decided to write down my reasoning here.</description>

      <title>How I completely quit social media</title>
      <link>https://www.aliabdoli.com/blog/socialmedia</link>
      <description>I used to love social media as it was a way to keep up with friends, keep up with the world, and was a creative outlet for myself. Being able to connect with anyone across the planet still sounds as magical as it did when the internet came out. As time went on, I felt social media was hurting me more than helping me so I have gone on a cleansing regiment. In 1981 nearly half of smokers knew cigarettes were bad for you but people could not quit [1]. I believe social media is currently at that stage since nearly half of Gen Z wishes social media was never invented [2]. As a member of Gen Z myself, I wrote this piece to help my fellow generation mates quit.  I will go the problem with social media, and how I was able to quit.</description>

      <title>Waiting for many things at once with `io_uring`</title>
      <link>https://mazzo.li/posts/uring-multiplex.html</link>
      <description>When doing systems programming we often need to wait for something to happen. Common examples might be waiting for some data to come through a socket or waiting on a lock. We also often want to wait on any of several conditions to become true. A web server might be handling many sockets at once, waiting for any number of them to become readable or writeable. This short blog post is concerned with the latter scenario in Linux. Until recently there was no generic framework which allowed us to wait on many arbitrary events, but now there is, thanks to `io_uring`.</description>
