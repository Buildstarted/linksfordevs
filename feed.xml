      <title>A Personal History of Compilation Speed, Part 1</title>
      <link>https://prog21.dadgum.com/45.html</link>
      <description>The first compiled language I used was the Assembler Editor cartridge for the Atari 8-bit computers.  Really, it had the awful name "Assembler Editor." I expect some pedantic folks want to interject that an assembler is not a compiler.  At one time I would have made that argument myself.  But there was a very clear divide between editing 6502 code and running it, a divide that took time to cross, when the textual source was converted into machine-runnable form.  Contrast that to Atari BASIC, the only language I knew previously, which didn't feature a human-initiated conversion step and the inevitable time it took.</description>

      <description>As a remote freelancer you likely receive payments from other countries and convert these different currencies into your own currency. These international payments and currency conversions often have hidden fees and unfavorable exchange rates which can cost you hundreds or even thousands a year.  Luckily for banks and payment providers,</description>

      <title>A very short introduction to COBOL</title>
      <link>https://flaviocopes.com/cobol/</link>
      <description>COBOL is one of those languages you keep hearing about, one of the remains of the past.
Turns out it’s the language that makes the world go around, in particular in banks and financial institutions. I read somewhere that over 70% of business transactions are made through programs written in COBOL.
There are various reasons for that. First, the language was designed for that use case.
After all, it’s called COmmon Business-Oriented Language.</description>

In this blog post I’ll talk a bit about contributing to PerfView and then continue with the GCStats analysis. You can skip to the analysis part directly if you like.
One of the frustrating things for me when it comes to tooling is there are a lot of memory perf tools out there but very few are targeting the common types of customers I normally work with.</description>
