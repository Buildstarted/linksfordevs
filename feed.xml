      <title>Debunking the Chessboard: Confronting GPTs Against Chess Engines to Estimate Elo Ratings and Assess Legal Move Abilities</title>
      <link>https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/</link>
      <description>Can GPTs like ChatGPT-4 play legal moves and finish chess games? What is the actual Elo rating of GPTs? There have been some hypes, (subjective) assessment, and buzz lately from “GPT is capable of beating 99% of players?” to “GPT plays lots of illegal moves” to “here is a magic prompt with Magnus Carlsen in the headers”. There are more or less solid anecdotes here and there, with counter-examples showing impressive failures or magnified stories on how GPTs can play chess well. I’ve resisted for a long time, but I’ve decided to do it seriously! I have synthesized hundreds of games with different variants of GPT, different prompt strategies, against different chess engines (with various skills). This post is here to document the variability space of experiments I have explored so far… and the underlying insights and results. 

The tldr; is that gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct operates around 1750 Elo and is capable of playing end-to-end legal moves, even with black pieces or when the game starts with strange openings. 
However, though there are “avoidable” errors, the issue of generating illegal moves is still present in 16% of the games. Furthermore, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo and more surprisingly ChatGPT-4, however, are much more brittle. Hence, we provide first solid evidence that training for chat makes GPT worse on a well-defined problem (chess). Please do not stop to the tldr; and read the entire blog posts: there are subtleties and findings worth discussing!

      <description>In about 10 years, Apple has multiplied by 19 the number of transistors in its mobile processors. It corresponds roughly to a steady rate of improvement of 34% per year on the number of transistors, or a doubling every 2.5 years. In real dollars, an iPhone has roughly a constant price: the price tag of … Continue reading How many billions of transistors in your iPhone processor?</description>

      <link>https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2023/10/18/galactic-civilizations-does-n1/</link>
      <description>I don’t suppose that Frank Drake intended his famous Drake Equation to be anything more than a pedagogical device, or rather, an illustrative tool to explain what he viewed as the most significant things we would need to know to figure out how many other civilizations might be out there in the galaxy. This was back in 1961, and naturally the equation was all about probabilities, because we didn’t have hard information on most of the factors in the equation. Drake was already searching for radio signals at Green Bank, in the process inventing SETI as practiced through radio telescopes.</description>

      <description>I know that time spent with my kids is supposed to be its own reward, and it is. But I also want to believe that what I do in this time matters, as much as possible. Elegantly handling a tantrum feels more worthwhile if I’m helping my son learn to express his feelings, not just making it through another day. I find more contentment at the end of a long afternoon if I think that I did a good job and that this good job will echo through the ages,...</description>

      <link>https://braedonmcdonald.ca/posts/binary-adder.html</link>
      <description>My niece has a toy that I constantly find myself playing with when I visit. It&amp;#39;s a simple wooden box with some switches and LEDs on the front. Electronics wise, the switches are just wired to toggle certain LEDs but it&amp;#39;s very fun to fiddle with and I find the overall design with the wooden enclosure very satisfying. For a long time I thought it would be cool to make something with a similar wooden enclosure that does something a bit more involved. This fall, I finally got around to following through with this idea and made something in the same spirit as my nieces toy except the LEDs and switches are connected to a binary adder.</description>

      <title>4K4D: Real-Time 4D View Synthesis at 4K Resolution</title>
      <link>https://zju3dv.github.io/4k4d/</link>
      <description>This paper targets high-fidelity and real-time view
            synthesis of dynamic 3D scenes at 4K resolution. Recently, some
            methods on dynamic view synthesis have shown impressive rendering quality. However, their speed is still
            limited when rendering high-resolution images. To overcome this problem, we propose 4K4D, a 4D point cloud representation that supports hardware
            rasterization and enables unprecedented rendering speed. Our representation is built on a 4D feature grid so
            that the points are naturally regularized and can be robustly optimized. In addition, we design a novel
            hybrid appearance model that significantly boosts the rendering quality while preserving efficiency.
            Moreover, we develop a differentiable depth peeling algorithm to effectively learn the proposed model from
            RGB videos. Experiments show that our representation can be rendered at over 400 FPS on the DNA-Rendering
            dataset at 1080p resolution and 80 FPS on the ENeRF-Outdoor dataset at 4K resolution using an RTX 4090 GPU,
            which is 30&amp;#215;	imes faster than previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art rendering quality.</description>
