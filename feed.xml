      <title>Synchronous buck converter for 12V/5A output</title>
      <link>https://tomscii.sig7.se/2024/10/Synchronous-buck-converter-12V5A</link>
      <description>What is the logical next step after making a linear
regulator? I learned some valuable lessons
(both regarding general electronics and power supplies) doing that
project, so I believe I could now make a much better linear
supply. And perhaps I will! But now I decided it was time to aim for a
switch-mode power supply (SMPS), a.k.a DC/DC converter.</description>

      <title>The Intelligence of Noetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://gelinasjames.com/the-intelligence-of-noetic-fields/</link>
      <description>Alan Briskin and I are working on a book about “fields.” I have written several previous posts about them. The map to this territory is becoming clearer and more detailed as we, along with David Sibbet, Gisela Wendling, Karen Buckley, and Philip Bakerlaar share our ideas and experiences&amp;#160; about and with fields. We are also investigating the work of those who have explored social fields before us like Mary Parker Follett, Kurt Lewin, Pierre Bourdieu, David Bohm, Lynne McTaggart, and Otto Scharmer. The following piece is an adaptation of writings and conversations between Alan and myself.</description>

      <title>4 Things I Would Do DIFFERENTLY In My Software Engineering Journey</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=jC0fJ2PCaeA</link>
      <description>Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be cool if you had a time machine?!

Well -- unfortunately that&amp;#39;s not an option.

But what IS an option is sharing lessons that can help others! You might not be able to help yourself directly, but you can help others from your experiences.

In this video, I share 4 things that I would do differently in my software engineering journey if I were to do it again.

      <title>Powering Up with Erik Jensen: An Introduction to EF Core Power Tools</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=HBgVkellxE4</link>
      <description>Metalama This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by Metalama, reduce your boilerplate code by up to 15% with Metalama&amp;#39;s C#-to-C# template engine and reduce your code complexity today!

 Show Notes Hi everyone,

 Just a quick thing before we start: this episode was recorded in the middle of summer, which meant that Erik needed to have his office window open. It&amp;#39;s possible to hear the outside traffic throughout, but rest assured that our editing team have done what they can to reduce it&amp;#39;s presence.

 It&amp;#39;s not that noticable and shouldn&amp;#39;t affect your enjoyment of the show, but I wanted to give you a heads-up. Also, do remember that there&amp;#39;s a full transcription available at the show&amp;#39;s website; so check that out, too.

 Anyway, let&amp;#39;s get to it.

 &amp;quot;So, I think my mantra for creating things like these tools is, &amp;quot;should be easy to get started and there should be a like an easy happy path but then if you want to deep dive and do a lot of options or even a t4 templates you can also do that,&amp;quot; but there should be a simple happy path with good error reporting if something fails.&amp;quot;— Erik Jensen

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focussing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie &amp;quot;GaProgMan&amp;quot; Taylor.

 In this episode, Erik Jensen joined us to talk about EF Core Power Tools, and how you can use his project to increase your productivity with EF Core-based databases, regardless of the database technology used; if it&amp;#39;s supported by EF Core, then the Power Tools extension supports it to.

 &amp;quot;The one that&amp;#39;s definitely used the most is what in a tool is referred to as reverse engineering. Where you point to an existing database, which can be some of the database types I mentioned previously. Like SQL Server, as a SQL database, Postgres, Oracle, MySQL, and Firebird. And then the tool asks you for a number of options, like you can specify what namespaces you&amp;#39;re using, and where the files are laid in your project, and many, many other options. And then when you press OK at that point, as you said, Jamie, the tool generates a DB context and some classes that represent your tables with navigations between the tables based on discovery of foreign key relationships.&amp;quot;— Erik Jensen

 We also briefly touched on the MSBuild.Sdk.SqlProj project and its goal of giving cross-platform .NET developers a way to both describe and build their ideal database schema in code. We also covered Erik&amp;#39;s personal process for dealing with feature requests, and how developers can ensure that that are providing valueable feedback to open-source projects; a subject that will come up again soon with future guest Scott Harden.

 Anyway, without further ado, let&amp;#39;s sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we&amp;#39;ll dive into the core of Modern .NET.
