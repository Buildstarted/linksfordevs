      <description>As title says, I’ve worked on building MLOps systems for nearly four years. Things run amazingly fast, and as a person that is also four years experienced guy, I kinda feel like I’ve tried to not drown by the new techs in deep learning(LLMs), trying to adapt software engineering, try to catch good positions in good companies remotely(that sucks), and more.</description>

      <description>Hello to all list-reading entities!  On Aug 16th 2024 German police considered it once again appropriate to raid the home&amp;amp;office at the registered address of our organization. The first raid was 2017. There are obviously still people working in German law enforcement today, who think that harassing a node-operator NGO would somehow lead to the de-anonymization of individual tor users. At least that is what they claim in the paperwork.  As with the first time, the raid team was fortunately a bit ...</description>
