      <description>Download Visual Studio: https://aka.ms/VS4MacDownload

Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript, with rich web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code are written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries. Visual Studio 2019 for Mac includes support for building Blazor Server applications, and in this session, Daniel Roth and Kendra Havens are going to show you how to get started!</description>

      <title>Scoping in JavaScript: The Basics</title>
      <link>https://hackernoon.com/scoping-in-javascript-the-basics-k73j32fv?source=rss</link>
      <description>Let's start with an example. You have the following code and like every good developer, your instinct cries out to remove the duplication. We should only call processVar in one spot. While having it twice might not be the end of the world, imagine additional functions need to be called while passing in x. You'd end up with a lot of duplication. Not very DRY of you. </description>

      <title>Waymo Via – Waymo</title>
      <link>https://waymo.com/waymo-via/</link>
      <description>Since 2017, the Waymo Driver has been learning to drive large Class 8 trucks in much the same way a human driver would, after years of driving passenger cars. Many of the principles are the same, but things like braking, turning, and checking for blind spots are quite different with a fully-loaded truck and trailer.  We’re currently testing our fleet of trucks in California and Arizona, and we’ll soon expand to Texas and New Mexico in the near future.</description>

      <title>Structured concurrency - Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency</link>
      <description>Structured concurrency is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by using a structured approach to concurrent programming. The core concept is the encapsulation of concurrent threads of execution (here encompassing kernel and userland threads and processes) by way of control flow constructs that have clear entry and exit points and that ensure all spawned threads have completed before exit.  The concept is analogous to structured programming, which introduced control flow constructs that encapsulated sequential statements and subroutines.  Such encapsulation allows errors in concurrent threads to be propagated to the control structure's parent scope and managed by the native error handling mechanisms of each particular computer language.  It allows control flow to remain readily evident by the structure of the source code despite the presence of concurrency. To be effective, this model must be applied consistently throughout all levels of the program-- otherwise concurrent threads may leak out, become orphaned, or fail to have runtime errors correctly propagated.</description>
