      <title>Tenno</title>
      <link>https://tenno.app/</link>
      <description>Tenno is an app that lets you create powerful dynamic documents where you can easily add and orchestrate computational elements.
      You can think of it as a mix between Word and Excel with a sprinkle of Javascript.
      You could also think of it as a more interactive and user friendly version of Jupyter notebooks.
      With Tenno you can build formulas like you do in spreadsheets, you can create charts, but you can also
      easily call APIs and mix and match everything.
      Tenno has an interactive live mode, where you see changes as you type, allowing for a very quick
      iteration loop.
      If you are into literate programming, Tenno could be something for you.</description>

      <title>When single threaded Node.js becomes a trouble</title>
      <link>https://www.canerg.com/posts/single-threaded-nodejs/</link>
      <description>As you know (as it is posted a dozen times a day), Javascript is a single-threaded language.
Thus, we will have a single thread serving all of our requests in our Node.js server unless we specifically play around this.
This can cause some troubles that you wouldn’t normally see when you write a web server in any multi-threaded language such as Go, Rust, Java, C++, or Python.
The problem Here is a scenario where this can get your server into trouble since one of your requests is CPU-intensive and the single thread that is supposed to serve for all requests is busy with calculating fibonacci.</description>

      <description>In 2017, Luke Smith started making YouTube videos. He was a Linguistics PhD student who made linux tutorials while talking about open source software and digital sovereignty. While he was never explicitly political, he was by no means left wing. He distrusted big tech, big government, and contributed to a cultural movement within the right of distrusting big tech.</description>

      <description>As someone with any sort of influence in a company, whether you’re a founder, executive, manager, influential employee, or anything in between, all your actions have a second order effect: reinforcing what&amp;#39;s culturally acceptable. Whenever you do something, you’re not just doing that thing. You’re also implicitly telling everyone around you: here in this company, it is okay or encouraged to do this thing, and this is the kind of thing you should expect to have happen going forward.</description>

      <title>Why we’re helping more wikis move away from Fandom</title>
      <link>https://weirdgloop.org/blog/why-were-helping-more-wikis-move-away-from-fandom</link>
      <description>Hi! You may have seen that Weird Gloop is now hosting the official League of Legends Wiki. We’ve spent the last couple months working with the Riot folks and the League wiki editors to move it off of Fandom, and turn it into something the players will (hopefully!) really dig. I also love that it got started because one of the Riot guys plays a ton of Old School RuneScape and thinks our wiki is awesome. How cool is that?? I want this to kick off a new era where communities and developers take control from Fandom, and make some really great wikis. We’ve already been doing a bit of this, starting when we helped the Minecraft Wiki leave Fandom, but I think it’s time for me (and the rest of our group) to be more explicit about what we want to do.</description>
