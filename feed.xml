      <title>Web by Google (TM)</title>
      <link>https://landshark.io/2020/08/16/web-by-google.html</link>
      <description>Looking at Mozilla’s finances, it’s reasonable to conclude that Google is keeping them on life support to keep the anti-trust hounds at bay. Mozilla’s deal with Google will account for at least 70% of their revenues going forward. That’s over $400 million to be the default search provider in 4% of browsers. For 1 year. I’ll bet my next paycheck that Google reupped this rather generous agreement to avoid a repeat of Microsoft’s troubles over an Internet Explorer monopoly. My guess is that Google will decide it’s in their interest to pull the plug right around the time this latest wave of anti-trust talk blows over.</description>

      <description>Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about in order to fix your problem.</description>

      <title>Fastest star ever seen is moving at 8% the speed of light</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2020-08-fastest-star.html</link>
      <description>In the center of our galaxy, hundreds of stars closely orbit a supermassive black hole. Most of these stars have large enough orbits that their motion is described by Newtonian gravity and Kepler's laws of motion. But a few orbit so closely that their orbits can only be accurately described by Einstein's theory of general relativity. The star with the smallest orbit is known as S62. Its closest approach to the black hole has it moving more than 8% of light speed.</description>

      <title>Short Domain Names</title>
      <link>https://jameswillia.ms/posts/shortest-domain-names.html</link>
      <description>What’s the shortest in-use domain name? There are quite a few three-letter domain names being used, such as Google’s g.co and Facebook’s m.me.
However, these aren’t the shortest domain names in use. A TLD is a valid domain name on its own, and there’s nothing stopping registrars from creating A records for their TLDs. For example:
$ dig +short A ai 209.59.119.34 Here’s a list of all TLDs which have A records and resolve to responsive servers (as of August 2020):</description>
