      <title>What’s the right UX for an expired certificate?</title>
      <link>https://emilymstark.com/2023/01/16/whats-the-right-ux-for-an-expired-certificate.html</link>
      <description>Every once in a while, I encounter some variation of the following question: how can a TLS certificate go from perfectly acceptable one day to completely insecure the next? In other words, why does the browser show a scary full-page warning for a certificate that expired one day, or even one hour, ago – the same as a certificate that is self-signed, chains to an unknown root, or presents the wrong name? The premise behind these questions is that an expired certificate (especially one that is recently expired) is not as bad as a certificate with some other type of validation error, and thus the warning UX shouldn’t be as severe.</description>

      <description>Whether you are looking for specific code files, classes, methods, or features and options in the IDE, finding them is not always easy. With multiple ways to search, how would you even know which one to choose? The new All-In-One Search combines code and feature search into the same UI and adds some extra power and productivity to the experience.</description>

      <description>I started my career in programming during heydays of Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE). This was late 90s/early 00s, and there was a rich ecosystem of enterprise vendors hawking application servers, monitoring tools, and boxes upon boxes of other fancy solutions. These tools were difficult to learn, expensive to license, and required an a...</description>

      <description>The largest rushes of adrenaline I&amp;#39;ve had in my professional life, always came when I was programming. During my PhD days, I was an experimentalist on paper, who worked in the lab. But when I started trying to simulate the microscopic dynamics that I have been measuring, I became absolutely</description>

      <title>The End for Third-Party Twitter Clients</title>
      <link>https://anderegg.ca/2023/01/15/the-end-for-third-party-twitter-clients</link>
      <description>Late last week, many third-party Twitter clients stopped working. It didn’t seem to affect all apps — Spring still works for me as of this writing — but the largest ones could no longer connect. Some speculated that this might be a bug. Twitter has had issues and downtime in the last several weeks, so that was plausible. There was pretty strong evidence that this was intentional, however.</description>

      <title>Managers need to do a better job explaining the engineering paths available</title>
      <link>https://des.wtf/post/1-12-23-engineering-paths.html</link>
      <description>I recently started to hit a mental ceiling in my career that has made me wonder what comes next.
    I’ve grown my skills in a pillar of software engineering that&amp;#39;s enough to land a coding job
    fairly easily, especially in this market (there&amp;#39;s still plenty of jobs!). I know enough
    about the languages I use and the problems I’m tasked with that it feels like 95% of my time
    coding has become mundane. This might sound benign and probably a little egotistical but it&amp;#39;s
    had a effect on my motivation. I&amp;#39;ve also noticed others in the same conundrum time and time
    again in our communities: solicitation for advice about getting out of a funk at work, or a
    senior dev&amp;#39;s worriment about having to eventually manage people. Work is at its worst when it’s
    boring and when there’s no foreseeable path forward it feels like a drag. And so, I finally had
    time to think about why I’ve been so burned out the last few years over the span of two jobs —
    I had no idea what paths were available.</description>
