      <title>.NET Rocks! Scaling a Monolith with Derek Comartin</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1853</link>
      <description>How do you scale a monolith? Carl and Richard talk to Derek Comartin about his blog posts and YouTube series around scaling a monolith. Derek talks about the tendency for folks to want to split a monolith into microservices without assessing if it will make a difference. There is no one right way! The conversation digs into different approaches to scaling - up, out, using caching, queuing, and more! There are many approaches to scaling your applications, and yes, microservices are an option, but there are many others!</description>

Phased arrays allow for applications not possible with traditional directional microphones, as the directionality can be changed instantly, after the recording is made, or even be focused at hundreds of thousands of points simultaneously in real time.</description>

      <title>Estimating gym goers: a mark and recapture experiment - Emir&amp;#39;s blog</title>
      <link>https://emiruz.com/post/2023-07-05-gym-mark-recapture/</link>
      <description>I had recently started going to a new specialist gym that runs 3 classes per
day during the working week and is closed the rest of the time. I’ve been at a
few different times on a few different days, and already I was seeing many of
the same people from the first class. It occurred to me that the chance of
seeing the same faces should somehow scale with the number of people going to
the gym, hence it may be possible to estimate the total number of gym members
from the number of people I repeatedly see. I then realised that sounds very
much like a
mark and recapture (MR)
experiment from Ecology, so I did a little bit of research to see how difficult
it would be to estimate the gym members using MR techniques.</description>
