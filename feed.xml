      <description>So I got this new attitude.  Now that I am burned out and I&amp;#39;ll
never accomplish anything, I&amp;#39;ve got this nice position at the university
teaching classes which I rather enjoy, and just like I read the
Arabian Nights for pleasure, I&amp;#39;m going to play
with physics, whenever I want to, without worrying about any importance
whatsoever.</description>

      <title>How to setup nginx reverse proxy for aspnet core apps with Docker compose</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/how-to-nginx-reverse-proxy-with-docker-compose/</link>
      <description>This article will discuss about configuring nginx reverse proxy for aspnet core apps with Docker compose. Today I took as session on Introduction to Docker Containers one of the question I received was how to run multiple instances of a container and load balance them. So in this blog post I am creating multiple instances of a ASP.NET Core Web API and load balance them with the help of nginx. Nginx is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.</description>
