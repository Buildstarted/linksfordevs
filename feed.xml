      <description>I recently got in the need of splitting quite large amount of audio files into smaller equal parts. The first thought that came to my mind was – probably thousand or more people had similar p…</description>

      <title>Value Has Nothing To Do With A Dev&amp;#39;s Salary</title>
      <link>https://shubhamjain.co/2022/06/25/value-has-nothing-dev-salary/</link>
      <description>Baring a few exceptions, programming tends to be a well-paid, cushy job. I don’t think there’s any other industry where fresh college grads can get the offers that (competent) programmers usually get.</description>

      <title>This copilot is stupid and wants to kill me: Matthew Butterick</title>
      <link>https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/this-copilot-is-stupid-and-wants-to-kill-me.html</link>
      <description>This week, Microsoft released an AI-based tool for writing soft&amp;#173;ware called Git&amp;#173;Hub Copilot. As a lawyer and 20+ year partic&amp;#173;i&amp;#173;pant in the world of open-source soft&amp;#173;ware, I agree with those who consider Copilot to be primarily an engine for violating open-source licenses.</description>

      <title>My awakening moment about how smartphones fragment our attention span</title>
      <link>https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/awakening-moment-to-how-smartphones-fragment-our-attention/</link>
      <description>I recently realized that absorbing the constant inflow of information from my smartphone, always readily available in my pocket to capture any free moment of attention, had fragmented my attention span.</description>

      <title>[TUHS] Re: forgotten versions - TUHS</title>

      <description>The Plan 9 CD-ROM needed about 100MB for the full distribution, if that. We
hatched a plan to fill up the rest with encoded music and include the
software to decode it. (We wanted to get the encoder out too, but lawyers
stood in the way. Keep reading.) Using connections I had with folks in the
area, and some very helpful friends in the music business, I got permission
to distribute several hours of existing recorded stuff from groups like the
Residents and Wire. Lou Reed gave a couple of pieces too - he was very
interested in Ken and Sean&amp;#39;s work (which, it should be noted, was built on
groundbreaking work done in the acoustics center at Bell Labs) and visited
us to check it out. Debby Harry even recorded an original song for us in
the studio.

We had permission for all this of course, and releases from everyone
involved. It was very exciting.

So naturally, just before release, an asshole (I am being kind) lawyer at
AT&amp;amp;T headquarters in Manhattan stopped the project cold. In a phone call
that treated me as shabbily as I have ever been, he said he didn&amp;#39;t know who
these &amp;quot;assholes&amp;quot; (again, but this time his term) were and therefore the
releases were meaningless because anyone could have written them.

And that, my friends, is why MP-3 took off instead of the far better
follow-on system we were on the cusp of getting out the door.

-rob

P.S. No, I don&amp;#39;t have the music any more. Too sad to keep.
