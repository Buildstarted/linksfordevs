      <title>HTTP/2 Push is dead</title>
      <link>https://evertpot.com/http-2-push-is-dead/</link>
      <description>One of the hot features that came with HTTP/2 was PUSH frames. The main idea is
that if the server can predict what requests a client might want to make, the
server can preemptively send request/response pairs to the client and warm its
cache.</description>

      <title>Why did renewables become so cheap so fast? And what can we do to use this global opportunity for green growth?</title>
      <link>https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth</link>
      <description>Fossil fuels dominate the global power supply because until very recently electricity from fossil fuels was far cheaper than electricity from renewables. This has dramatically changed within the last decade. In most places in the world power from new renewables is now cheaper than power from new fossil fuels.</description>

      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip297.html</link>
      <description>Before you create a solution, it is critical that you think deeply about all aspects of it, including performance, security, availability, costs, maintainability and deployment. Considering these aspects and creating designs for your solutions to accommodate them, is called creating an architecture design. This can be very complex as you need to consider a lot of things and need knowledge about many services, design patterns and best practices.</description>

      <link>https://sophielemos.com/posts/modifying_firmware/</link>
      <description>Lately I have been analyzing some embedded devices such as routers, and want to share how to emulate, extract, and modify firmware.
We may want to do this for several reasons, such as enabling SSH/telnet to debug a service remotely, adding new features and looking for security vulnerabilities.
If you want to dump the firmware from a physical device, you will want to use something such as the CH341A, but it won&amp;amp;rsquo;t be covered here.</description>

      <title>How I Translate Feature Requests into Code</title>
      <link>https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/turning-feature-requests-into-code/</link>
      <description>As part of my previous job I worked on a CAD/CAM package, and a very common task would be to take a vague feature description, rephrase it as a more formal software problem, then use computational geometry algorithms to turn it into code which can be integrated into the overall application.
I eventually got quite good at this, so I’m going to write down the system I came up with. This process works especially well for larger features which add new functionality with minimal coupling to existing code.</description>

      <description>How Does Microsoft Do DevOps So, just how does Microsoft do DevOps? I get asked this all the time. The answer is a little bit complex because to really understand how Microsoft does DevOps, you need to understand where Microsoft was in the late 90’s and early 2000’s.</description>

      <title>A Chain Just Cut Through A Capsized Cargo Ship Filled With Cars And The Process Is Fascinating</title>
      <link>https://jalopnik.com/a-chain-just-cut-through-a-capsized-cargo-ship-filled-w-1845784581</link>
      <description>Back in September of 2019, a 600+ foot cargo ship called the MV Golden Ray, which was apparently loaded in an unstable fashion with over 4,000 cars, capsized in St. Simons Sound just off the port of Brunswick, Georgia. Since then, responders have been working to remove the ship in sections to send the hulk to the scrapper. November was particularly exciting, as workers used a chain to cut off the first enormous chunk of ship, revealing mangled cars within. Here’s at look at the fascinating way the team pulled this off.

      <description>Both QBE and LLVM are compiler backends using an SSA
representation.  This document will explain why LLVM
does not make QBE a redundant project.  Obviously,
everything following is biased, because written by me.</description>

      <title>How can I check whether the user has disconnected from the session? | The Old New Thing</title>

      <description>If another user signs onto a Windows system without the previous user signing out, then the previous user goes into a state known as Disconnected. Programs in the previous user’s session continue to run, but what if you want your program to check whether the session has been disconnected?</description>

      <description>OK, I have to admit this this is a strange collection. In the late 1980&amp;#39;s and early 1990&amp;#39;s, I worked for Kmart behind the service desk and the store played specific pre-recorded cassettes issued by corporate. This was background music, or perhaps you could call it elevator music. Anyways, I saved...</description>

      <description>In part two of our .NET 5 coverage, we take a look back at historic .NET technologies that never made the jump to .NET Core. What’s interesting about these technologies is their APIs were copied across, hinting that Microsoft was considering a .NET Core implementation of them in the future.</description>

      <title>Handling Duplicate Messages (Idempotent Consumers)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeBY8fCWfvU</link>
      <description>Do you create idempotent consumers? &amp;quot;At Least Once&amp;quot; message guarantees that a message will be delivered to a consumer once or many times. This means that you need to develop your consumers to be able to effectively handle duplicate messages. Not doing so could result in some bad outcomes of your system.  For example, processing an order twice, would not likely be a good outcome.  Why do message brokers support &amp;quot;At Least Once&amp;quot; messaging, and how do you handle duplicates?  Here&amp;#39;s how to make idempotent consumers and be resilient to duplicate messages.
