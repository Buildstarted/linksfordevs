      <title>Weird things I learned while writing an x86 emulator</title>
      <link>https://www.timdbg.com/posts/useless-x86-trivia/</link>
      <description>If you’ve read my first post about assembly language, you might expect that this is another post on how to understand assembly language. I will write more about that at some point, but this post is not that. Instead, this post is going to talk about some of the weird things and random trivia I learned while writing an x86 and amd64 emulator. The emulator I wrote was for Time Travel Debugging.</description>

      <title>fake tags are a real problem – Tom Lee</title>
      <link>https://tomlee.wtf/2023/02/03/fake-tags-are-a-real-problem/</link>
      <description>As a bicyclist I am always ready to believe the worst about drivers. Drivers are why I’m woken up by gunning engines in the middle of the night. Drivers are why I have titanium screwed into my collarbone. Drivers! That I bring my children to school by bicycle every weekday morning has only raised the stakes and, along with it, my ire.</description>

      <title>Names can be so much more</title>
      <link>https://kodare.net/2023/02/02/names-can-be-so-much-more.html</link>
      <description>We programmers say names (of variables, functions, classes, etc.) are extremely important. The debate over how much code should be self-documenting is largely a debate about how good names can be. I think this all misses a bigger problem: names are for humans only, but they don’t have to be.</description>

      <title>Stuff I Don&amp;#39;t Like About Netflix</title>
      <link>https://ghvsted.com/blog/stuff-i-dont-like-about-netflix/</link>
      <description>Over the past few months, I have noticed my usage of Netflix has increased. I typically watch Netflix on my Macbook using a Safari browser. While I love that Netflix exists to fill those 10, 15-minute breaks when I am having lunch, there’s just some stuff I do not quite like about using Netflix. I list some of them below:
 Content I have seen before still gets recommended to me Movies and shows I have previously seen still show up on “My List” —&amp;#160;It would be nice to have them move to a separate category.</description>
