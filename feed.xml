      <title>Things I hate about Partiful</title>
      <link>https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2024/05/09/things-i-hate-about-partiful.html</link>
      <description>The aesthetic for all parties is basically the same. That aesthetic is bad. A party is an aesthetic creation, so having all guests’ first experience of the thing you are offering them be a chintzy piece of crap that matches every other chintzy piece of crap is much worse than if the thing they were selling was like low-quality toilet paper or something. As far as I can tell, the only way to be informed of parties using Partiful is via SMS. Perhaps this is idiosyncratic to me, but I have no desire to ever use SMS. I also don’t want to receive a message in the middle of whatever I’m doing to hear about a new party happening. Fuck off. This should only happen if the party is very time sensitive and important. Like if a best friend or much sought after celebrity is having a party in the next twenty minutes, sure text me, if you don’t have WhatsApp. Otherwise, ffs email me. As far as I can tell, the only way to message the host a question about the party is to post it to the entire group. Yet there are very few questions I want to text an entire guest list about. Supposing I make the error of doing that (which I do not), as far as I can tell, the guest list receives an sms saying that I have sent a message, and they have to click to follow a link to the website to see what the message is.</description>

      <description>If you use nothing in place of something, not much good will come of it.
Warning bells should start ringing when a program

what I mean.

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been mulling over the idea of this blog post for a long time, probably since I wrote this older post describing a couple examples of monads. Monads are infamously tricky to grok, which is why I&amp;#39;ve been looking for examples to help myself understand the commonest Haskell monads that are as simple as possible, yet at the same time well-motivated (no Foo Bar Baz or any of that gibberish).</description>
