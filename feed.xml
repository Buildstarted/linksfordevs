      <description>I&amp;#39;ve heard many times that DDD should be applied to complex, interesting domains only. Even some&amp;#160;experts that I deeply admire say that, so it&amp;#160;must be true, right? The problem is that I&amp;#39;ve never heard&amp;#160;what exactly makes a domain&amp;#160;interesting&amp;#160;or&amp;#160;complex.&amp;#160;Especially, what makes it interesting or complex enough for the purpose of&amp;#160;DDDifying it.

      <description>Like almost any Linux distribution that has a container image available, you can run Amazon Linux 2022 on the Windows Subsystem for Linux. This guide assumes you&amp;#39;ve installed and configured WSL2 and already have something like Debian running under it.
Download Until AL2022 is available at https://cdn.amazonlinux.com/os-images/latest/ (or more likely https://cdn.amazonlinux.com/os-images/2022/) we&amp;#39;ll be pulling it from Amazon ECR Public. When it is on the CDN you won&amp;#39;t need another Linux and can instead download the archive directly.</description>

      <title>My Seatbelt Rule for Judgment</title>
      <link>https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/my-seatbelt-rule-for-judgment/</link>
      <description>One of my formative childhood lessons came when I was playing in the garage one
day. I went into my mom’s car and put the seatbelt on (probably to pretend I was
flying a plane). I realized at one point that I could still lean pretty far
forward. Far enough that my head could touch the dashboard. How ridiculous!
What’s the point of the seatbelt if it doesn’t actually stop me from going too
far? I reveled in my discovery that seatbelts were useless.</description>

      <description>It’s the 2020s, we continue to become more connected that we’ve ever
been, and I hate it! I don’t have the self-control needed to handle
these always-on devices. It’s awful. They’re all so incredibly powerful
and give so much in terms of information. I, however will be on reddit
or hackernews pretending I’m productive reading about someone else’s
terrificly productive project. I’ve lived with my brain enough to know,
uncontrolled smartphones aren’t really for me. I’ve written elsewhere
how my smartphone is basically a dumb
one,
but I’ve tried to replace the various pieces of value my phone delivers
with more dedicated devices.</description>

      <title>APIs as ladders</title>
      <link>https://blog.sbensu.com/posts/2022-01-24-apis-as-ladders/</link>
      <description>Developers have opinions on what a good API1 is, but rarely have a shared vocabulary to describe what makes them good. This essay puts forward one set of considerations (out of many) that we started using at Stripe in 2019 to discuss API design2. You can find some of these concepts interspersed in this excellent blogpost by Michelle Bu.The hard part of an API is not to use it, but to learn it. After learning how the API works, typing out the commands is not hard. But when you first time you encounter an API, a million questions pop into your mind: What is this object for? Is there a parameter for that? Can the API do X? Learning requires effort, but the more the developer learns, the more problems they can solve. We can imagine the developers climbing a ladder where, for every step they take up the “learning ladder”3, the more problems they can solve.</description>

      <title>The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and Massachusetts Institute of Technology release technological research on a central bank digital currency</title>
      <link>https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/frbb-and-mit-open-cbdc-phase-one.aspx</link>
      <description>The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Digital Currency Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology today released the findings of their initial technological research into a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. The published research&amp;#160;describes a theoretical high-performance and resilient transaction processor for a CBDC that was developed using open-source research software, OpenCBDC. This collaborative effort, known as Project Hamilton, focuses on technological experimentation and does not aim to create a usable CBDC for the United States. The research is separate from the Federal Reserve&amp;#39;s Board&amp;#39;s evaluation of the pros and cons of a CBDC.</description>
