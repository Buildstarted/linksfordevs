      <title>An eSIM manager for Mobile Linux</title>
      <link>https://lucaweiss.eu/post/2024-06-24-esim-manager-for-mobile-linux/</link>
      <description>For a while eSIM management on Mobile Linux, such as postmarketOS, was just a dream. Now it’s real!
Background Nowadays many smartphones and other devices have a so-called eSIM - or eUICC - built-in to the device. This eSIM is essentially a chip on the PCB of the device that allows an end user to download a SIM profile - essentially all the data of a SIM card - to said chip and then the modem of the device can use that chip the same way as it would use any physical SIM card you insert.</description>

      <description>VMWare Workstation is a popular virtualization software that was recently made available for free personal use after VMWare was acquired by Broadcom. This is an excellent move by Broadcom, as it will help many users to utilize this software for free for personal use and learning purposes.
I have been using VMWare Workstation on Linux for a while now and I have to say that it is a great piece of software.</description>

As such, I wanted to write down some things that I learned so that in the future I can remember a bit better what was hard for me. That way, should I one day advise PhD students working on their first papers, I can help them through the learning curve better.</description>

      <title>Why Test? | Jonathan&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://jonathan-frere.com/posts/why-test/</link>
      <description>Why do you write tests?
I&amp;amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this question a lot recently. I’ve been trying to motivate some teammates that tests are worth writing. But I&amp;amp;rsquo;m going to convince them of that, I need to be able to answer that question for myself, right?
Tests sometimes get portrayed as one of the chores of software development. As a new developer, that’s how I saw tests for a long time: something I did because it was what I was told to do — besides, if I got the coverage to 100%, I got a little green checkbox to put on my README.</description>
