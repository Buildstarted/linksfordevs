      <title>Orthodox Privilege</title>
      <link>http://paulgraham.com/orth.html</link>
      <description>There has been a lot of talk about privilege lately. Although the
concept is overused, there is something to it, and in particular
to the idea that privilege makes you blind — that you can't see
things that are visible to someone whose life is very different
from yours.</description>

      <link>https://ndcmelbourne.com/speaker/yaser-adel-mehraban/</link>
      <description>Although it doesn’t look like it, Yaser is an almond croissant addict cleverly disguised as a successful web developer. Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be slightly more than difficult to make a living out of thin air and sitting in a café eating a croissant and drinking a cappuccino, he’s focused his energy on the web, which happily has proven itself to be a wonderful decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from that, he has a hunger for public speaking, hence a number of talks in big conferences like NDC and Voxxed Days around the world under his belt.

      <title>Pixel Art Tutorials - Saint11</title>
      <link>https://saint11.org/blog/pixel-art-tutorials/</link>
      <description>This is my series of tutorials that I made with the help of my Patrons, they are all 512x512 pixels and were primarily focussed on twitter but eventually became it’s own thing. All these tutorials are free, but if you want to support me, you can do it on Patreon or you can buy them in a nice .zip file on Itch.io.
If you want to Ctrl+F (Cmd+F in mac) to find something, I added some tags to the titles to help with that, I also added a ‘#’ symbol before each tag.</description>

      <title>How to Transform Your Board Meeting with Written Narratives by @ttunguz
</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/written-board-meetings/</link>
      <description>Written materials transform board meetings. With most of us working remotely, many startups have thrown out Google slides and replaced them with Google docs. It’s a fundamental change, and one I hope persists after work returns to the new normal.
Amazon is famous for its narrative process and contempt of slides. The email in which Bezos banishes decks reads:
“The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than ‘writing’ a 20 page PowerPoint is because the narrative structure of good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what’s more important than what how things are related.</description>

      <title>The Power of Defaults</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/power_of_defaults/</link>
      <description>I use every ounce of willpower to keep still. One wrong move might wreak
havoc. After carefully assessing the situation, I move my mouse over the
right option, select it, and press ‘Next’. Crisis narrowly averted, I am
now confronting the next set of inane settings—until finally, this
installation of Windows 10 is finished. Midway along the process, I
ask myself whether the designers of the setup process are aware that the
majority of users will probably select the defaults, thus making it easy
for Microsoft to use extra diagnostic data, install additional software,
and decrease the user’s privacy even further. Welcome to 2020!</description>

      <description>Traditionally, most career advice has centered around building an impressive resume. Most job hunters spend most of their time on resume reviews and practice interviews. However, in the internet era, a resume is way overrated. The resume is dead. And content killed it.</description>

      <title>Save the world with a personal carbon tax</title>
      <link>https://blog.iamhamy.xyz/posts/consider-a-personal-carbon-tax/</link>
      <description>This half, some of my goals are to raise money and awareness for climate change and to reduce my carbon footprint by 10%.
In the past I’ve done this by changing my diet and paying a carbon tax. Recently I’ve been intrigued by the power of economic motivators as an agent of behavior change and particularly how I could utilize those motivators myself.
One thing I’ve been thinking about recently is to expand my personal carbon tax to help encourage myself to make better decisions and to make up for those decisions when I make a poor choice.</description>
