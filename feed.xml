      <description>How’s that for a semi formulaic clicky bait headline… Everybody wants to be rich and or wants to trade stocks. The more that Gamestop, bitcoin and meme stocks make the headlines, the more upwork requests I get to build something to make money for other people? Sure I don’t mind building a trading platform (stocks, … Continue reading &amp;quot;Why I Love Making Other People Rich With their Silly Trading Strategy!&amp;quot;</description>

      <title>How to Back Up Your Signal Conversations</title>
      <link>https://ronitray.xyz/posts/signal-backup.html</link>
      <description>Signal has established itself as one of the major encrypted messengers to stake a claim as a WhatsApp replacement of late. However, there are factors that affect usability negatively, many of which are deliberate decisions to favour privacy and security. One of these is the fact that no cloud backups are offered by the app. They want nothing to do with how you store your conversations, and would likely need a LOT more money if they had to store all your conversations themselves (a-la Telegram) or lose a lot of trust if they had to delegate the task to Google, Apple or some other provider. The result is that all conversations are stored on-device, and you need to handle the backup manually if you would like to retain them after reinstalling or changing devices. This is something they don&amp;#39;t make clear up front, and has been a pain point for myself in the past and a number of my contacts more recently. Here&amp;#39;s how you ensure your Signal conversations aren&amp;#39;t lost to oblivion.</description>

      <description>The general availability of easy-to-use centralized continuous integration1 (CI) solutions in recent years - from GitHub Actions2 and Travis as hosted solutions, and from Jenkins3 and Hudson as on-premises solutions - has been wonderful for allowing software to be tested continuously throughout development, catching errors early before changes are merged to shared development and mainline branches.</description>
