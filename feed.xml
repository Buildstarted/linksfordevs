      <title>The Smartest Way To Manage Callbacks in An Event-Driven System</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=QOvCa4aDF-Q</link>
      <description>Hi, I&amp;#39;m James. And in this video you&amp;#39;ll learn all about the types of tests you should be writing when building an event-driven system. Specifically, schema and contract tests.

As a producer in an event-driven system, one of your main responsibilities is to not make breaking changes. Which raises the question, why can&amp;#39;t you test for that? In this video you&amp;#39;ll see a strategy you can use in your .NET applications to make sure you never make a breaking change again.

      <title>Using DeepSeek R1 for RAG: Do&amp;#39;s and Don&amp;#39;ts</title>
      <link>https://blog.skypilot.co/deepseek-rag/</link>
      <description>DeepSeek R1 has shown great reasoning capability when it is firstly released. In this blog post, we detail our learnings in using DeepSeek R1 to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, tailored for legal documents.
We choose legal documents because legal professionals often face a daunting task: navigating libraries of cases, statutes, and informal legal commentary. Even the best-intentioned research can get bogged down in retrieving the right documents, let alone summarizing them accurately.</description>

      <description>There’s tools like Miro and Lucidchart which are very good for making diagrams and have cool multiplayer(gen z talk) features but with 2 major drawbacks:
separate from code not free The payed part can be ignored even though it’s a pain to switch tools every new company and not being to use it in personal projects but the separation from code does not cut it for me.
I’ve been using draw.io and exporting pngs for quite a while but recently I discovered a vscode plugin that fixed it all for me.</description>

I&amp;#39;m a bad friend, and I have accepted that, but he&amp;#39;s always asking me about whatever my latest hyperfixation project is. Did I finish it; did I write a post about it; did I release it to the app store. The question is triggering because the answer is almost always &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>When I joined GitHub in 2021, they were on the cusp of launching GitHub Codespaces. Codespaces is one part cloud IDE, one part VM; the key selling point is that you can go to any Codespaces-enabled repo in your browser, click “New Codespace,” and you’ll be launched into an environment where you can write, test, and commit code, without a lot of setup. This is powered primarily by Visual Studio Code’s devcontainer feature.</description>

      <description>I started using aider last month as a way to get back in shape after a long leave from work. Eventually aider sped me up a lot, but I had to learn some new ways of approaching development. It was different from using cursor in that you don’t really see the code until it’s being edited. This doc is a compilation of the notes I took as I worked on a few projects, which I think will be helpful to others using aider for the first time.</description>
