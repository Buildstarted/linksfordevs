      <title>Jepsen: MongoDB 4.2.6</title>
      <link>http://jepsen.io/analyses/mongodb-4.2.6</link>
      <description>MongoDB is a distributed document database which claims to offer “among the strongest data consistency, correctness, and safety guarantees of any database available today”, with “full ACID transactions”. Jepsen evaluated MongoDB version 4.2.6, and found that even at the strongest levels of read and write concern, it failed to preserve snapshot isolation. Instead, Jepsen observed read skew, cyclic information flow, duplicate writes, and internal consistency violations. Weak defaults meant that transactions could lose writes and allow dirty reads, even downgrading requested safety levels at the database and collection level. Moreover, the snapshot read concern did not guarantee snapshot unless paired with write concern majority—even for read-only transactions. These design choices complicate the safe use of MongoDB transactions. This work was performed independently, without compensation, and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy. MongoDB, Fauna, and YugaByte, all mentioned in this report, have previously engaged Jepsen for paid analyses.</description>

      <title>How Not to Store Passwords</title>
      <link>https://pboyd.io/posts/how-not-to-store-passwords/</link>
      <description>Here’s a fun list to look through: Dumb Password
Rules. Most of the
rules seem arbitrary, like only allowing digits, but some hint at deeper
problems. For instance, preventing single-quotes. They aren’t inserting
passwords into a database without a SQL placeholder, right? Nearly every site
on that list has a needlessly short maximum password size. If they’re storing
passwords correctly, there’s no need for this. This post will go through a few
bad ways to store a password and you can see what I mean.</description>
