He has also published 300+ articles and has authored over 14 books on topics such as C#, SQL Server, and many .NET technologies! &amp;amp;nbsp; In their conversation, Paul gives listeners an update on everything new in .NET. He speaks about the new .NET 5 release, .NET vs .NET Core, desktop apps vs. browser apps, upfront architecture, C#, and Visual Basic. He also shares his thoughts on where he sees technology headed in the next 5-10 years, the current path and strategy for teaching developers, the most important areas to pay attention to and questions to ask when planning your application, and how you can best stay on top of your game as a developer. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:38] Be sure to visit  for past episodes and show notes.

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201204-00/?p=104513</link>
      <description>On occasion, I make a typo and get “JavaScript error: Semicolon expected” and I chuckle a little, because JavaScript was designed to make semicolons optional most of the time. When I made this observation, some of my friends were amused because I included the phrase “JavaScript was designed.”</description>

      <title>A Spellchecker Used to Be a Major Feat of Software Engineering</title>

      <description>Here&amp;#39;s the situation: it&amp;#39;s 1984, and you&amp;#39;re assigned to write the spellchecker for a new MS-DOS word processor.  Some users, but not many, will have 640K of memory in their PCs.  You need to support systems with as little as 256K.  That&amp;#39;s a quarter megabyte to contain the word processor, the document being edited, and the memory needed by the operating system.  Oh, and the spellchecker.</description>

      <title>How to Start Contributing To Open-Source</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF9IUQlZ2Sk</link>
      <description>Open-source software has become a foundational piece of modern software engineering, existing as the platform for everything from personal projects to the most successful products. Open-source is often framed as a good way to garner both visibility and experience, but in that assertion there&amp;#39;s a lot of assumptions about how you&amp;#39;ll participate. In this talk, we&amp;#39;ll cover basics of contributing to open-source and discuss tooling, etiquette, and self-care with the goal of preparing you to start making meaningful contributions to an existing open-source project.

      <description>One question I often ask potential software engineering candidates is to pinpoint the percentage of code coverage in an ideal project. Interestingly enough, many of them jump to the sky with numbers beyond 90%. They would start preaching how well-tested code is more reliable and brings more value to all</description>

      <title>Triaging Information</title>
      <link>https://pateldhvani.com/posts/triaging/</link>
      <description>Just as patients are triaged in a hospital, information that you consume should also be triaged. When you come across an article/paper/book that you like, save it. Then after some time (to settle any infatuation), triage the source and only if it meets a threshold, commit to it.
 We live in the age of information. Every day we consume all sorts of information. We read emails sent to us by co-workers, watch videos explaining how proteins fold, read Paul Graham’s essays, try new products, read Tweets, papers, the news and the list just goes on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve had this nagging feeling that the computers I use today feel slower than the computers I used as a kid. As a rule, I don’t trust this kind of feeling because human perception has been shown to be unreliable in empirical studies, so I carried around a high-speed camera and measured the response latency of devices I’ve run into in the past few months. Here are the results:</description>
