      <title>What does it mean to listen on a port?</title>
      <link>https://paulbutler.org/2022/what-does-it-mean-to-listen-on-a-port/</link>
      <description>This story explores some concepts in computer networking, inspired by Michael Nielsen’s idea of discovery fiction. Code samples can also be found in this repo. Excerpts use openbsd-flavoured netcat on Debian Linux; behviour and IPv6 support may vary by version.</description>

      <title>Implementing Basic Authentication in ASP.NET Core Minimal API</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/implementing-basic-authentication-in-minimal-webapi/</link>
      <description>This post is about how implement basic authentication in ASP.NET Core Minimal API. Few days back I got a question / comment in the blog post about Minimal APIs - about implementing Basic authentication in Minimal APIs. Since the Action Filters support is not available in Minimal API I had to find some alternative approach for the implementation. I already wrote two blog posts Basic authentication middleware for ASP.NET 5 and Basic HTTP authentication in ASP.Net Web API on implementing Basic authentication. In this post I am implementing an AuthenticationHandler and using this for implementing basic authentication. As I already explained enough about the concepts, I am not discussing them again in this post.</description>

      <title>Angular Server Side Rendering on Azure Static Web Apps</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/angular-server-side-rendering-azure-static-webapps/</link>
      <description>This post is about how implement Angular Server side rendering apps on Azure Static Web Apps. What is server-side rendering - A normal Angular application executes within the browser, rendering pages within the DOM in response to user actions. Angular Universal executes on the server, generating static application pages that later get bootstrapped on the consumer. This implies that the appliance usually renders additional quickly, giving users an opportunity to look at the appliance layout before it becomes totally interactive.</description>

      <title>Call to mediocrity</title>
      <link>https://nikofischer.com/call-to-mediocrity</link>
      <description>This is a call to mediocrity. Do things without intending to hit the big time. Do! Start! Don&amp;#39;t think about the output, but make the way to your goal. Yes: all too often you&amp;#39;ve set out to do it, and yet you&amp;#39;ve failed again and again to meet your standards. Every text, every website, every important email: you&amp;#39;ve twisted words, deleted sentences, and rewritten. Often enough you crumpled things up afterwards and threw them away. But how much didn&amp;#39;t get done in the first place?</description>

      <title>Interview question &amp;quot;When we use async/await, how does the main thread know when the awaitable task has finished (under the hood)&amp;quot; : dotnet</title>
      <link>https://teddit.pussthecat.org/r/dotnet/comments/sqf4ff/interview_question_when_we_use_asyncawait_how/</link>
      <description>I was one of the designers of the async/await language feature. I probably could not answer this question to the satisfaction of the interviewer, but that is likely because the interviewer has a specific answer in mind that pertains only to a specific scenario. That the question presupposes the existence of a &amp;quot;main thread&amp;quot; implies that there is a second thread involved; that&amp;#39;s common but by no means required or universal. I understand the feature primarily from the language design perspective, not from the behind-the-scenes low-level implementation details of the runtime.</description>

      <title>Misadventures of an Early Engineer — Dylan Barth</title>
      <link>https://www.dylanbarth.com/blog/early-engineer/</link>
      <description>The red text beneath the login form read &amp;quot;Unexpected error.&amp;quot; I was looking over the shoulder of a support technician named Eric who had just tried logging in to our product for the first time. His cubicle looked identical to the other eighty or so scattered around the room except for the custom-built mechanical keyboard with unmarked keycaps and neon-backlight sitting on his desk. We&amp;#39;d been getting along great, but now he was looking back at me with an expression of betrayal on his face that told me exactly what he was thinking: “Please tell me you haven’t wasted my entire Saturday.”</description>
