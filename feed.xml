      <title>Using SignalR in ASP.NET Core &amp; React to Send Messages</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU-isq-PQ_Y</link>
      <description>A recorded live stream, where we go ahead and install SignalR onto an ASP.NET Core MVC API &amp; React application.

From there, we will create an endpoint in our API where we can send messages to. After that, the API will send out a message to all clients connected stating that the message has been received.

The React application is used to send messages through SignalR. It also is used as a listener, where it receives any message that SignalR sends out.</description>

      <title>Pokémon Sprite Decompression Done By Hand</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBVwnUH8Eek</link>
      <description>Donate to The Bail Project here: https://donate.tiltify.com/@retro-game-mechanics-explained/decompress

Don't know what's going on? Check out the video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF1Yw_wu2cM

Webapp for decompressing &amp; compressing sprites: http://www.dotsarecool.com/rgme/tech/gen1decompress.html

During this livestream, I will be collecting donations for The Bail Project. The Bail Project is a non-profit organization that aims to pay bail for those faced with unaffordable cash bail. While bail is intended to be used as an incentive to return to trial, in the recent years it has been used unfairly as a form of pretrial detention. After bail is returned, The Bail Project uses the same money to pay additional bail for others. For more information on The Bail Project, please visit https://bailproject.org/ .

Donations will be done through Tiltify, so your money will be sent directly to The Bail Project without going through me first. Additionally, advertisements and other monetizations like super chats will be disabled for this livestream.

      <title>Shared Cache is Going Away</title>
      <link>https://www.jefftk.com/p/shared-cache-is-going-away</link>
      <description>Browsers historically have had a single HTTP Cache. This meant that if  www.a.example and www.b.example both used cdn.example/jquery-1.2.1.js then JQuery would only be downloaded once. Since it's the same resource regardless of which site initiates the download, a single shared cache is more efficient. [1]  Unfortunately, a shared cache enables a privacy leak. Summary of the simplest version:   I</description>

      <description>I see Tailwind being used by a lot of people. I totally get why it’s so popular. It looks great, the design choices are sensible, and you have copy-pastable code that reliably renders in the same way.</description>

      <title>Jonathan Bergknoff: Terraform Pain Points</title>
      <link>https://jonathan.bergknoff.com/journal/terraform-pain-points/</link>
      <description>I love using Terraform. At my previous job, we managed our infrastructure entirely with Terraform: tens of thousands of resources spread across several cloud providers. The benefits of infrastructure-as-code and Terraform, in particular, are massive, but well known. While I still consider Terraform the best tool of its kind, this article describes some pain points that my team and I encountered as power users. I hope it can lead to some discussion about ways to improve.</description>
