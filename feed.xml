      <title>Decoding IP Addressing and Subnetting – The Backbone of Networking - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/decoding-ip-addressing-and-subnetting-the-backbone-of-networking/</link>
      <description>In today&amp;#39;s hyper-connected world, where everything from your smartphone to your coffee machine can be online, understanding networking is no longer just for IT pros. At the heart of all this connectivity lies IP addressing and subnetting—the unsung heroes of the digital age. These concepts are the foundation of how devices communicate and share data seamlessly across networks, ensuring everything works. But how does it all happen? Let&amp;#39;s break it down.</description>

      <title>The day I taught AI to read code like a Senior Developer</title>
      <link>https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-senior-developer</link>
      <description>A messy experiment that changed how we think about AI code analysis Last week, I watched our AI choke on a React codebase - again. As timeout errors flooded my terminal, something clicked. We’d been teaching AI to read code like a fresh bootcamp grad, not a senior developer. Here’s what I mean.</description>

      <title>Docker on MacOS is still slow?</title>
      <link>https://www.paolomainardi.com/posts/docker-performance-macos-2025/</link>
      <description>TLDR Link to heading Two years after my first analysis of Docker performance on MacOS, things have improved significantly. VirtIOFS is now much faster (bind mounts are only 3x slower instead of 5-6x), and we have new solutions in the ecosystem. Lima (open-source) performs well and sometimes better than Docker Desktop, while Docker’s new file synchronization feature offers impressive speed improvements (59% faster) but requires a paid subscription. For the most stable performance, the hybrid approach (combining bind mounts with volumes) remains the best practice. Choose your setup based on your needs:</description>

      <title>Web page annoyances that I don&amp;#39;t inflict on you here</title>
      <link>http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2025/01/04/cruft/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about things that annoy me about other web pages.  
Safari recently gained the ability to &amp;quot;hide distracting items&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;ve 
been having great fun telling various idiot web &amp;quot;designers&amp;quot; to stuff it.  
Reclaiming a simple experience free of wibbly wobbly stuff has been 
great.</description>
