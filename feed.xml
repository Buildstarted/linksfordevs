      <title>mht.wtf</title>
      <link>https://mht.wtf/post/simplicity/</link>
      <description>I used to think that simplicity is good because of the other values it often brings:
a simple system is easier to write;
a simple system is easier to build;
a simple system is more portable;
a simple system is easier to debug and reason about;
a simple system performs well;
a simple system is easier to change.
The word “simple” does some heavy lifting here, and I found that I would often use these as a metric for if something was simple or not.
In other words, these weren’t the result of simplicity, they were the definition.</description>

      <title>The Reasoning Computer</title>
      <link>https://fabisevi.ch/2023/11/10/the-reasoning-computer/</link>
      <description>The Turing test is dead, and we killed it. The Turing test is a test of a machine&amp;#39;s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. From the 1940s  to the 2010s people programmed computers, and computers could only do what they were programmed to do in a rules-based deterministic manner. Sometimes a person would program the computer and it would do something unexpected, but 100 out of 100 times the computer was doing what it was programmed to do whether the person liked it or not. While there has been experimentation with what today we call AI since the 1950s, those machines were a long ways away from passing the Turing test. Why does using ChatGPT feel more like a conversation with the smartest person you know than a computer? It&amp;#39;s because ChatGPT doesn&amp;#39;t solve problems deterministically the way a programmed computer&amp;#160;does, it solves them probabilistically.  ChatGPT demonstrates the ability to think about something in a logical, sensible way, the definition of reasoning.  We&amp;#39;ve created something completely new here, a reasoning computer.</description>

      <title>What to do when someone tells you to &amp;quot;take initiative&amp;quot;</title>
      <link>https://erik.wiffin.com/posts/what-to-do-when-someone-tells-you-to-take-initiative/</link>
      <description>I have always hated the phrase “Don’t bring me problems, bring me solutions!”. It feels lazy. It incentivizes people to sweep things under the rug if they can’t figure out what to do. It doesn’t give any useful direction to the person bringing you problems, because if they had solutions, they probably would have brought them already! At its best, it’s unhelpful, at its worst, it’s actively harmful.
I have similar, but less strong issues with the idea of telling someone to “take more initiative”.</description>
