      <description>In this episode, Jeffrey and Richard are jumping into part-two of their two-part conversation! If you haven’t caught the previous episode, “Richard Campbell on the Humanitarian Toolbox — Episode 132,” be sure to tune into that first before diving into this one! &amp;amp;nbsp; Richard Campbell is an entrepreneur, advisor, and rabid podcaster.

In today’s conversation, Richard speaks all about his new project to write a book compiling the history of .NET! He shares why this project is important to him, what it will serve as an important resource to developers new and old to the field, key pieces and insights into the history of .NET, and his predictions on the future of .NET, A.I., automation, and more! &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:38] Be sure to visit  for past episodes and show notes.

      <title>Portable Internet Behavior Bond</title>
      <link>https://andrewbadr.com/log/29/portable-internet-behavior-bond/</link>
      <description>Makers of free apps, including apps with a free plan or trial period, are forced to spend an inordinate amount of time fighting abuse of their services. Twitter has to fight spam bots, multiplayer games deal with cheaters, dev platforms have people scamming CPU time, anything that touches email needs rules and rate limits—the list goes on. This tiresome work is an endless game of cat-and-mouse, and uses time and money that would ideally be spent on improving features for real users.</description>

      <title>How I Use My Free Azure Credit &amp;#128184;</title>
      <link>https://www.thesamosborne.com/posts/how-i-use-my-free-azure-credit/</link>
      <description>Microsoft has a program for all engineer employees to get some free Azure credit to play with. Having been with Microsoft for two summer internships I have accumulated two separate accounts with $150 of credit/month each. Growing up pinching pennies, I am not one to let anything free go to waste, so for the past couple years I have been using my Azure credit for some fun stuff.

      <title>The Fastest, Safest PNG Decoder in the World</title>
      <link>https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2021/fastest-safest-png-decoder.html</link>
      <description>Summary: Wuffs’ PNG image decoder is memory-safe but can also clock between
1.22x and 2.75x faster than libpng, the widely used open source C
implementation. It’s also faster than the libspng, lodepng and stb_image
C libraries as well as the most popular Go and Rust PNG libraries. High
performance is achieved by SIMD-acceleration, 8-byte wide input and copies when
bit-twiddling and zlib-decompressing the entire image all-at-once (into one
large intermediate buffer) instead of one row at a time (into smaller,
re-usable buffers). All-at-once requires more intermediate memory but allows
substantially more of the image to be decoded in the zlib-decompressor’s
fastest code paths.</description>

      <title>Programming is hard</title>
      <link>https://dorinlazar.ro/2021-02-programming-is-hard/</link>
      <description>Most beginners in programming eventually end up with the same ingratiating message: „Programming is easy, everyone can do it”, with some threatening message that people doing the gatekeeping should stop doing that. I’m here to tell you that that is not true. Programming is hard, programming is not for everyone, and for the time being everyone might be able to do it, but most definitely most should not. Like most of the empty, shallow, positive messages coming with an automatic defense against refute, in this case talking about this gatekeeping thing that simply doesn’t happen.</description>

      <description>We successfully deployed ThreadSanitizer in the Firefox project to eliminate data races in our remaining C/C++ components. In the process, we found several impactful bugs and can safely say that data races are often underestimated in terms of their impact on program correctness.</description>

      <title>Laying Out Pages | Web Browser Engineering</title>
      <link>https://browser.engineering/layout.html</link>
      <description>So far, layout has been a linear process that handles open tags and and close tags independently. But web pages are trees, and look like them: borders and backgrounds visually nest inside one another. To support that, this chapter switches to tree-based layout, where the tree of elements is transformed into a tree of layout objects for the visual elements of the page. In the process, we’ll make our web pages more colorful with backgrounds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16574</link>
      <description>A small group of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates
inadvertently formed a longitudinal study contrasting expected productivity
levels with actual productivity levels. Over the last nine months, our group
self-reported 559 tasks, dates, and completion times -- expected and actual.
Here, I show which types of tasks we are the worst at completing in the
originally planned amount of time (spoiler: coding and writing tasks), whether
more senior researchers have more accurate expectations (spoiler: not much),
and whether our expectations improve with time (spoiler: only a little).</description>
