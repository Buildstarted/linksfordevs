      <title>Future of DeepSpeech / STT after recent changes at Mozilla</title>

As many of you know, we were gearing up for our first stable release, version 1.0, in conj...</description>

      <title>Cryptography Dispatches</title>
      <link>https://buttondown.email/cryptography-dispatches?tag=twitter</link>
      <description>Cryptography Dispatches is Filippo Valsorda's lightly edited newsletter. It tries to bring longer form discussion of the cryptography engineering topics touched on @FiloSottile, but broader breath than those covered at blog.filippo.io. The goal is not to talk about what's new, but what's interesting, with enough space to elaborate on how things work. Also, it's a way to write more, so expect less polish than blog.filippo.io.</description>

      <description>Since the Raspberry Pi 4 came out last year, we now have an excellent candidate to base the mini server on. The faster processor and option for up to 8GB of RAM opens up more possibilities for what you can do with it, including now being more than capable as a general Linux desktop system, so with all that in mind, I'd like to introduce the NODE Mini Server version 3.</description>
