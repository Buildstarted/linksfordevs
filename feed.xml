When a young company adds one customer, they aren&amp;#39;t just adding the LTV of that customer. They are also adding the likelihood of winning other customers with similar problems. T</description>

      <description>Please note I write these posts more for myself than anyone else. I’m no preacher.
As the (as of yet unknown) outcome of the 2020 US Presidential Election looms large, I think it’s high time to reflect on all the ways in which we vote, and not just in governmental elections. In fact, the non-political votes you cast are probably moreimportant, given that you cast these votes nearly every waking minute of your life.</description>

      <link>https://hillelwayne.com/post/queueing-prism/</link>
      <description>For latency, anyway.
A common architecture pattern is the “task queue”: tasks enter an ordered queue, workers pop tasks and process them. This pattern is used everywhere from distributed systems to thread pools. It applies just as well to human systems, like waiting in line at a supermarket or a bank. Task queues are popular because they are simple, easy to understand, and scale well.
There are two primary performance metrics for a task queue.</description>

      <description>When working with dates and times in a Razor Pages form, you need to render 
	a suitable control based in the task requirement. Prior to HTML5, developers 
	largely depended on third party date picker libraries. Now, a variety of native 
	browser options 
	exist, although they enjoy 
	varied support across modern browsers. These include options for 
	managing the date and time, just the date or time, and for working with the 
	month or week of the year.</description>
