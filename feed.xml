      <title>The Job Is Not To Build</title>
      <link>https://www.chrismdp.com/the-job-is-not-to-build/</link>
      <description>Startup CTOs or founding developers are the first technical people in the business. It is natural to think your job is to write code and build software. This is backwards.

Your first job is not to build software. Your role is to use your technical expertise to help the startup figure out fast if you have a valid solution to a compelling problem, and then a valid product for a big enough market.

You might do this through building software, but you might not need to.

Here is a story of how I did this wrong, and how you can do it right.

      <link>https://blog.vladovince.com/my-brand-new-digitizing-workflow-using-a-25-year-old-film-scanner/</link>
      <description>Photography is arguably my oldest hobby. I’ve loved taking photos for as long as I can remember. I reflected on my first encounter with digital photography in 2003 in a recent post, but I’m old enough that I first got to know photography through film. I still don’t know what it is exactly that draws me to still images, but I find the same joy capturing light with a cameraRead More</description>

      <title>Recent Trends with Text Embeddings: Decoder-Only LLMs</title>
      <link>https://yuvalmerhav.com/posts/2024-12-02-decoder-embeddings</link>
      <description>Introduction Fine-tuned BERT-style bidirectional encoders, such as E5, have long dominated text embedding models, delivering state-of-the-art performance for many sequence-level tasks at an accessible cost. However, currently, many of the top performing models on the MTEB leaderboard, a text embedding benchmark for various tasks (retrieval, clustering, classification, etc.) are decoder-only language models at the ~7B scale. These models leverage larger context windows and pretraining on web-scale data.
This post reviews the papers of the following models:</description>

      <title>ML for related posts on Hugo</title>
      <link>https://dizzy.zone/2024/12/02/ML-for-related-posts-on-Hugo/</link>
      <description>After reading the technicalwriting.dev post on embeddings I thought to myself - this seems like something that I can implement quite quickly and would serve as a good starting point for some hands on experience with machine learning. I want to start small, so something as simple as filling the related posts section of this blog seems like an ideal candidate to get my hands dirty.
This blog is made with Hugo and uses the related content feature which provides a list of related posts based on the tags &amp;amp; keywords you use. While I have no quarrels with the mechanism, I thought this would be a good place to try and experiment with embeddings.</description>

      <title>[Monkey Conf 2024] Designer first UI development</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=3m3oIkjEI3g</link>
      <description>Implementations that do not match design specs. Behavior redesigns that misalign with architecture. Friction between designer and programmers. General frustration in both sides. Designer first UI development purpose is to minimize those situations or eliminating them completely. In essence it based around letting designers build the UI themselves, so there is nothing between their vision and execution. Programmers provide tools and support but never build the actual layouts. This is nothing new, level designers have been doing this for a long time in game development. They build the levels, and programming provides the tools and support but never get in the middle. This changes the relationship between departments completely from confrontational to collaborative. Since programming responsibility is to empower and support the designers.

      <link>https://www.philipzucker.com/superpose_datalog/</link>
      <description>Resolution is an old technique in automated reasoning. Datalog is a family of languages capable of expressing recursive database queries. The ancestry of datalog can be traced back to resolution and it is interesting and fruitful to examine the capabilities of modern resolution style provers in light of the use cases and operational interpretability of datalog.</description>

Amateur radio is one of those things I&amp;#39;m only vaguely aware of. It chugs along in the background unnoticed. It doesn&amp;#39;t follow the fashion of today&amp;#39;s industry, nor does it chase growth at all costs. It is an open standard, run by a decentralised group of people rather than a corporation, and it favours relentless practicality rather than KPIs. I …</description>
