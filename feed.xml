      <description>This release removes all scanning around behaviors, stream behaviors, and pre/post processors. That proved too problematic so you MUST register each of these explicitly with the appropriate registration methods inside AddMediatR. This also ensures that the order of behaviors and pre/post processors reflects the explicit order of registration.</description>

      <title>Measuring the carbon footprint of pizzas</title>
      <link>https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/carbon-footprint-pizzas/</link>
      <description>Making environmentally friendly decisions can only be done with the right information. At Carbonfact, we’ve realized a big challenge is the lack of information about industrial processes. We tackle that slowly but surely by gathering data from various sources, and making it available to our customers.
Regarding food, the French government has a great initiative called Agribalyse. It’s a free database of environmental footprints for various food products. It includes raw ingredients straight out from the farm, as well as ready to eat dishes from the supermarket.</description>
