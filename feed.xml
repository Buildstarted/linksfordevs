      <description>These are early days in the march towards a truly user-owned internet, and it is quite normal that the critical building blocks of such an effort (in this case, NFTs) get misunderstood and criticized quite a bit. Here is one perspective to help NFT critics see the light.</description>

      <description>Also available in French.

When debating, we usually consider that opinions are merely resulting of being exposed to logical arguments. And understanding them. If arguments are logical and understood, people will change their mind.

      <title>Owning Your Matrix Account</title>
      <link>https://blog.ergaster.org/post/20210622-owning-your-matrix-account/</link>
      <description>When we deployed our Matrix instance for GNOME, we were really used to IRC. We did not think through all the ways people would use an account for, and left registrations too open. As a consequence, many people created an account on our instance because they like the GNOME Project, and started using it as a personal account.
Now that we are more experienced with the difference between an organisational account and a personal one, I would like to walk you through the differences between the two, why segregating activities can be useful, and finally how to migrate data from an account to another.</description>

      <title>Information Theory: A Tutorial Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05968</link>
      <description>Shannon&amp;#39;s mathematical theory of communication defines fundamental limits on
how much information can be transmitted between the different components of any
man-made or biological system. This paper is an informal but rigorous
introduction to the main ideas implicit in Shannon&amp;#39;s theory. An annotated
reading list is provided for further reading.</description>
