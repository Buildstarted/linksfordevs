When David Smith, Joseph Myers (@jsm28), Chaim Goodman-Strauss and I posted our paper &amp;quot;An aperiodic monotile&amp;quot; (https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10798) back in March, we answered the open problem of whether a single shape could tile the plane aperiodically.

Some people observed that tilings by the &amp;quot;hat&amp;quot; used both unreflected and reflected tiles.  Although the einstein problem was answered, in some contexts (e.g., tile floors), you&amp;#39;d likely have to manufacture two separate tiles.  Our paper left open the question of whether a shape could tile aperiodically using translations and rotations only, with no reflections.

I hate to sound like a broken record, but then, on March 26th, Dave noticed something interesting. (1/n)</description>

      <title>An aperiodic monotile</title>
      <link>https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/hat/index.html</link>
      <description>An aperiodic monotile, sometimes called an &amp;quot;einstein&amp;quot;, is a shape
that tiles the plane, but never periodically.  In this paper we 
present the first true aperiodic monotile, a shape that forces 
aperiodicity through geometry alone, with no additional constraints
applied via matching conditions.  We prove that this shape, a polykite
that we call &amp;quot;the hat&amp;quot;, must assemble into tilings based on a substitution
system.  The drawing above shows a patch of hats produced using a few
rounds of substitution.</description>

      <title>9 Announcements in Microsoft Build 2023 and their Implications for the Future</title>
      <link>https://michaelscodingspot.com/microsoft-build-2023/</link>
      <description>The annual Microsoft Build 2023 conference just occurred and it came with a truckload of announcements. This event is Microsoft’s developer-focused conference, and it’s usually about cloud services and developer platforms. But it’s not unusual for the conference to be used as a marketing opportunity, and this year wasn’t an exception. Microsoft marketed the hell out of Windows, Microsoft 365, and Bing among other products, and it did so with a singular focus on AI.</description>

      <description>Recent .NET Core versions have changed how .NET Core Library projects output dependencies into the build folder. The new behavior doesn&amp;#39;t output depdencies, unlike full framework .NET projects which always automatically dumped dependencies into the build output folder. This isn&amp;#39;t a common requirement, but when you need it, the options are sufficiently obscure and this post discusses how you can make your dependencies output into the build folder</description>

      <description>Your resume is a simple enumeration of your experience and the first sample of work you are presenting to a potential employer. Many developers neglect the quality of their resume because they aren’t comfortable with writing, not comfortable talking about themselves, or simply because they don’t think it is important.</description>

      <description>A major personal accomplishment in 2022 – something I’m proud of – was creating a philanthropic framework. My wife and I intend to use this framework to guide our charitable giving for the rest of our lives, with the explicit goal of giving away almost all of our wealth in our lifetimes. Here’s some backstory, and all the details of our plan and the framework that guides our giving.</description>

      <title>Microfrontends should be your last resort</title>
      <link>https://www.breck-mckye.com/blog/2023/05/Microfrontends-should-be-your-last-resort/</link>
      <description>In large tech companies these days, it is becoming common for front-end developers to talk about “micro frontends”. MFEs are analogous to microservices in backend systems. But just like we’ve all seen bad microservice architectures that simply worsened a distributed monolith, a bad micro-frontend architecture just spreads tightly-coupled code across many moving parts.</description>

      <description>TL;DR “It’s hard to make predictions in the ever evolving data landscape, but I am not sure if we need a better Airflow. Building a better Airflow feels like trying to optimize writing code that shouldn’t have been written in the first place.” - https://dagster.io/blog/rebundling-the-data-platform

      <title>Controlling Your Fate with OIDC and Tailscale</title>
