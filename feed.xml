      <description>When I still followed the Usenet group comp.lang.forth, I wasn&amp;#39;t the only person frustrated by the lack of people doing interesting things with the language. Elizabeth Rather, co-founder of Forth, Inc., offered the following explanation: there are people solving real problems with Forth, but they don&amp;#39;t hang-out in the newsgroup. She would know; her company exists to support the construction of commercial Forth projects.</description>

      <link>https://www.josephguadagno.net/2022/06/15/clean-up-some-dot-net-clutter</link>
      <description>As some of you know, I do a lot of public speaking and blogging,  although the blogging seems to have taken a vacation lately :smile:. One of the side effects of blogging and speaking is that I have a lot of versions of .NET on my machine, along with other software. Today, after installing the latest version of .NET, I took a look at what versions of the SDK and runtime I have on my machine. I was a bit surprised to see that as to how many versions of .NET were on my machine.</description>

      <link>https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2022/chance_luck_and_risk.html</link>
      <description>Every so often, I&amp;#39;m asked to talk about my &amp;quot;career&amp;quot;, generally to people
younger than I am. I realised early on that the path I&amp;#39;d taken was so full of
unexpected turns that it would be ludicrous to talk about it as if it was
the result of hard work and deliberate choices. I therefore chose to
emphasise how lucky I&amp;#39;d been. Not only did this have the virtue of modesty but
it genuinely seemed the most plausible explanation.</description>

      <description>I love movies, so as a fun exercise for my fast.ai course, I created an app - which you can use here - that lets you search frames from YouTube videos based on the text you type in. It’s named “It Happened One Frame”, in tribute to the classic 1934 romantic comedy “It Happened One Night”.</description>

      <description>Feel free to join the discussion on HackerNews.
 In the early 2020 I was working in the Distributed Queries team of YDB. YDB is a Distributed SQL Database that combines high availability and scalability with strong consistency and ACID transactions. One of my key tasks there was to develop new storage format for JSON data. YDB recently became open source, so I can now share some interesting technical details behind this journey.</description>

      <description>A completely valid criticism of this project could be: Adama is an over-engineered bespoke piece of infrastructure in search of a problem. Fair. I had a great conversation a few weeks ago, and one of the things that occurred to me is that I’m sitting on a super power. Namely, I solved a problem of turning infrastructure into user-generated content. Allow me to ramble, dig into this, and expand.</description>
