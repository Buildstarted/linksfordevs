      <title>SARS-CoV-2 infection and reinfection in a seroepidemiological workplace cohort in the United States</title>
      <link>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256609v1</link>
      <description>Identifying the extent of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is crucial for understanding possible long-term epidemic dynamics. We analysed longitudinal PCR and serological testing data from a prospective cohort of 4411 US employees in four states between April 2020 and February 2021. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression investigating the association between baseline serological status and subsequent PCR test result in order to calculate an odds ratio for reinfection. We estimated an adjusted odds ratio of 0.09 (95% CI: 0.005 – 0.48) for reinfection, implying that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline is associated with around 91% reduced odds of a subsequent PCR positive test. This suggests that primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides protection against reinfection in the majority of individuals, at least over a sixth month time period. We also highlight two major sources of bias and uncertainty to be considered when estimating reinfection risk, confounders and the choice of baseline time point, and show how to account for both in our analysis.

      <title>Building a Simple Air Quality Monitor</title>
      <link>https://blog.jean-francois.im/2021/05/08/building-a-simple-air-quality-monitor/</link>
      <description>During the terrible wildfires that we had in California in 2020, it was possible to
know how good or bad the outside air quality was through PurpleAir’s excellent sensor network.
However, having all the windows closed due to the poor air quality outside, I
was wondering about the air quality inside as well. While it’s definitely possible to get
pre-made devices — such as PurpleAir’s indoor air quality sensor, IQAir’s indoor air quality sensor, or even something cheapo from AliExpress —
building my own is much more interesting:</description>

      <link>https://phirephoenix.com/blog/2021-05-03/privacy</link>
      <description>There’s a depressing sort of symmetry in the fact that our modern paradigms of privacy were developed in response to the proliferation of photography and their exploitation by tabloids. The seminal 1890 Harvard Law Review article The Right to Privacy—which every essay about data privacy is contractually obligated to cite—argued that the right of an individual to object to the publication of photographs ought to be considered part of a general ‘right to be let alone’.</description>

      <description>I love Europe, and I want to see the European Union succeed. I also love the Internet, and I want to see it thrive as well. And it therefore pains me that it now appears that the European Union might inadvertently be picking an ugly fight with “The Internet”.
What is going on? A new EU directive is currently making its way through the various EU bodies. This Proposal for directive on measures for high common level of cybersecurity across the Union is the successor of the initial attempt known as the NIS Directive.</description>
