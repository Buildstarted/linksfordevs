      <title>Dogs distinguish human intentional and unintentional action - Scientific Reports</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94374-3</link>
      <description>When dogs interact with humans, they often show appropriate reactions to human intentional action. But it is unclear from these everyday observations whether the dogs simply respond to the action outcomes or whether they are able to discriminate between different categories of actions. Are dogs able to distinguish intentional human actions from unintentional ones, even when the action outcomes are the same? We tested dogs’ ability to discriminate these action categories by adapting the so-called “Unwilling vs. Unable” paradigm. This paradigm compares subjects’ reactions to intentional and unintentional human behaviour. All dogs received three conditions: In the unwilling-condition, an experimenter intentionally withheld a reward from them. In the two unable-conditions, she unintentionally withheld the reward, either because she was clumsy or because she was physically prevented from giving the reward to the dog. Dogs clearly distinguished in their spontaneous behaviour between unwilling- and unable-conditions. This indicates that dogs indeed distinguish intentional actions from unintentional behaviour. We critically discuss our findings with regard to dogs’ understanding of human intentional action.</description>

      <title>Dutch cities want to ban property investors in all neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://nltimes.nl/2021/09/02/dutch-cities-want-ban-property-investors-neighborhoods</link>
      <description>The large municipalities in the Netherlands plan to make wide use of a legislative amendment that will allow them to designate neighborhoods where investors won&amp;#39;t be allowed to buy cheap and medium-priced homes and rent them out, NOS found after surveying the municipalities.&amp;#160;

This legislative amendment is expected to take effect on January 1. The intention is to give people looking for a home a better chance of finding one on the tight Dutch housing market. Last year, a third of all homes sold in the four large cities were bought by investors.&amp;#160;</description>

      <description>I am sure, you must have heard of Proxy and reverse proxy server. This is a very important topic, when we talk about backend engineering &amp;amp; computer networking. Some times it&amp;#39;s very confusing to find the exact difference between both of them.</description>

      <title>List of Gaming Laptops with MUX Switch - Jarrod&amp;#39;s Tech</title>
      <link>https://jarrods.tech/list-of-gaming-laptops-with-mux-switch/</link>
      <description>It is important to know whether a gaming laptop has a MUX switch before buying it, because this feature lets you disable optimus and get a speed boost in games. About This List This list only includes gaming laptops that I have personally tested and verified as having a MUX switch. Unfortunately I have not tested every single model from every generation, however generally if say a 10th gen MSI GE66 has a MUX switch, I’d say it’s usually pretty safe to assume that the newer 11th gen version has it too – though this may not always be the case. It’s more common for this feature to be added in a newer model if it wasn’t there previously than for a company to remove it, but of course check laptop reviews where ever possible to confirm. Please note that some models with the same name may or may not have a MUX switch, unfortunately it can be confusing and difficult to determine. Likewise, it can also depend on the specs of the laptop itself. For example, the ASUS Zephyrus S17 with 4K screen does NOT have a MUX switch, while the 1440p model does have one. The Acer Triton 500 with RTX 2060 graphics does not have a MUX switch, while the higher end 2080 model does, so specs can matter too which is why I’ve listed these as well. How To Use This Data All laptops are sorted in alphabetical order. You can click the column headers to instead list all laptops that do or do not have a MUX switch, or simply search the model in the search box.</description>
