      <title>REST Constraint #3: Going Stateless for Scalability - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/rest-constraint-3-going-stateless-for-scalability/</link>
      <description>When it comes to building scalable web applications, statelessness is one of REST‚Äôs most powerful constraints. It simplifies architecture, makes scaling easier, and helps APIs handle massive traffic loads without breaking a sweat. But what does being ‚Äústateless‚Äù actually mean in REST, and why is it such a big deal?</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding is a Dangerous Fantasy</title>
      <link>https://nmn.gl/blog/vibe-coding-fantasy</link>
      <description>Last week, X exploded when a ‚Äúvibe coder‚Äù announced his SaaS was under attack. His business, built entirely with AI assistance and ‚Äúzero hand-written code,‚Äù was experiencing bypassed subscriptions, maxed-out API keys, and database corruption. His follow-up admission made this notable: ‚Äúas you know, I‚Äôm not technical so this is taking me longer than usual to figure out.‚Äù As someone deeply immersed in the AI code generation space, I‚Äôve been watching this unfold with a mix of sympathy and frustration. Let me be clear ‚Äî I‚Äôm not against AI-assisted development. My own tool aims to improve code generation quality. But there‚Äôs a growing and dangerous fantasy that technical knowledge is optional in the new AI-powered world. After observing many similar (though less public) security disasters, I‚Äôve come to a controversial conclusion: vibe coding isn‚Äôt just inefficient ‚Äî it‚Äôs potentially catastrophic.</description>

      <title>I used AI to write tests for my .NET application... Here's what happened</title>

In this practical walkthrough, I explore how AI can transform the often tedious process of writing unit tests for .NET applications. Starting with a tour of my semi-complex .NET project, I explain its real-world use cases and demonstrate some existing test implementations. The video reveals why providing AI (specifically using Cursor) with example tests dramatically improves its ability to generate high-quality unit tests that match your coding standards and patterns. Watch as I demonstrate the complete workflow - from generating unit tests for the Domain layer to troubleshooting and fixing AI-generated code errors, and finally running the successful tests in Visual Studio.

We'll then extend the approach to the Application layer, showing how this technique can be applied across different parts of your architecture. Whether you're looking to reduce testing bottlenecks or improve your coverage, this step-by-step guide shows exactly how AI can become a valuable addition to your .NET development toolkit.

      <title>Deploying With Confidence: Sam Gomez on Terraform, Bicep, and Infrastructure as Code</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=1tTagViBT8M</link>
      <description>Show Notes "If you talk to people that have been doing Terraform for many years, they're going to tell you that, "Terraform is the law and Terraform is the way to go." But like you said, there's different tools, I would say, or languages that you can use for infrastructure as code. And it really depends what you want to do, what your developers are used to or are comfortable with and what works with your organization as it should be with any tool in software development. You got to grab the one or use the one that is more appropriate for your use case, your scenario, your organization"‚Äî Sam Gomez

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie "GaProgMan" Taylor.

 In this episode, Sam Gomez joined us to talk about Infrastructure as Code, why you might want to think about using something like Terraform and Bicep, and how they can help you to automate your deployments to the public cloud.

 Sam also talks about best practises for CI/CD and ways to test your Infrastructure as Code ahead of running it--something that we've all felt the pain of in the past, I'm sure.

 "Terraform has what's called validation for your parameters. So like I said, you can set up a validation that says, "the only values for the SKU for a SQL server are basic," for example. And if somebody tries to give a different value to that particular parameter, it'll stop automatically and say, "okay, this validation has failed. You know, the value allowed is this one." You can do the same thing with Bicep. So that's another added layer of protection against making these kind of mistakes and adding or configuring the wrong values in your deployments"‚Äî Sam Gomez

 Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.

 Podcasthon 2025! One last thing before we start the episode: we're super happy to participate in the 3rd edition of Podcasthon For one week, more than a thousand podcasts will highlight a charity of their choice. And today, I have the pleasure of welcoming Andy's Man Club to the show. Throughout this episode, I'll interrupt the conversation a few times to talk about the importance of mental fitness.

 The reason that I've picked Andy's Man Club is because mental health support is very important to me. I've used their groups for almost two years and have had the honour of being asked to step up and help run one of those groups. If you'll forgive the name for now, Andy's Man Club is a UK-based charity which organises weekly, informal, peer-to-peer talking groups for anyone over the age of 18 who identifies as male. I'll talk more about Andy's Man Club later in the episode.

      <title>CSS Animation with offset-path</title>
      <link>https://yuanchuan.dev/css-animation-with-offset-path</link>
      <description>This is from last year when I tried to recreate Rach Smith's P5.js animation using CSS.
    The animation seemed like it could be implemented in a breeze, but there's an illusion of simplicity.
    The process of manually updating the positions and directions of each box was
    a bit tricky.</description>

      <title>On Product-Market Fit</title>
      <link>https://cra.mr/on-product-market-fit/</link>
      <description>One of the most difficult challenges I've faced in my career is figuring out product-market fit. I'd wager most of us have gotten there through sheer dumb luck. What do we do if we're not lucky, if we don't strike gold on our first try? I don't know if I have the answer. What I can do is try to break down what worked for Sentry's error monitoring - a reverse engineering of sorts - and reason about how we'd apply that to new products.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúUp, down, up, down, up, down, ‚Ä¶‚Äù
What comes next?
You know the answer - it is ‚ÄúUp‚Äù
How did you know it?
Your mind inferred some sort of structure, and made a guess
I mean - we do not know - what truly will come next.
But we are pretty sure - due to the repetition - and we expect it to be ‚Äúup‚Äù.
There could be a breakage of pattern, but the fact that we expected an outcome - that hints at underlying structure.

      <title>OCaml‚Äôs Standard Library (Stdlib)</title>
      <link>https://batsov.com/articles/2025/03/14/ocaml-s-standard-library/</link>
      <description>Every programming language comes with some ‚Äúbatteries‚Äù included - mostly in the form of its standard library. That‚Äôs typically all of the functionality that‚Äôs available out-of-the-box, without the need to install additional libraries. (although the definition varies from language to language) Usually standard libraries are pretty similar, but I think that OCaml‚Äôs a bit ‚Äúweird‚Äù and slightly surprising in some regards, so I decided to write down a few thoughts on it and how to make the best of it.</description>
