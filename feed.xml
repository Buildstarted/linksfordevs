      <title>My tips on giving technical talks</title>
      <link>https://marcusnoble.co.uk/2025-04-30-my-tips-on-giving-technical-talks/</link>
      <description>I've been giving talks at meetups and conferences for a few years now. I started off after the encouragement of my friends giving their own talk and looking so cool doing it! It's taken a while but I think I'm at a stage now where I'm not only good at it (at least I hope so üòÖ) but I feel confident and comfortable while doing it. I want everyone to have that same confidence and I want to hear ALL OF YOU giving talks too! You have stories to tell, lessons to share and experience to pass on. So here is my learnings on how I approach giving a talk in front of a crowd of techies, mainly focussed on technical talks but most of this should apply to most public speaking.

      <title>A Critical Look at MCP - Raz Blog</title>
      <link>https://raz.sh/blog/2025-05-02_a_critical_look_at_mcp</link>
      <description>"MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI
applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP
provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools."</description>

      <title>Waiting for Postgres 18: Accelerating Disk Reads with Asynchronous I/O</title>
      <link>https://pganalyze.com/blog/postgres-18-async-io</link>
      <description>Postgres 18 introduces Asynchronous I/O (AIO) that can dramatically improve read performance, especially in the cloud. Learn how these changes and the new io_method setting work and see why our benchmark results show that io_uring is the recommended setting for maximizing I/O performance in Postgres 18 over the default setting 'worker'.</description>

      <title>AI is Making Developers Lazy: RIP Core Coding Skills</title>
      <link>https://www.darrenhorrocks.co.uk/ai-making-developers-lazy-rip-core-coding-skills/</link>
      <description>The hum of the AI co-pilot has become a familiar soundtrack in the world of software development. These intelligent tools, promising increased efficiency and code generation prowess, have been embraced with open arms by many. But what happens when this reliance morphs into over-dependence? What are the potential pitfalls of blindly trusting algorithms we don‚Äôt fully comprehend, especially when they occasionally ‚Äì or even frequently ‚Äì get it wrong? And perhaps most worryingly, what becomes of the core skills that define a truly capable software developer?</description>
