      <title>C# 9 records as strongly-typed ids - Part 3: JSON serialization</title>
      <link>https://thomaslevesque.com/2020/12/07/csharp-9-records-as-strongly-typed-ids-part-3-json-serialization/</link>
      <description>In the previous post in this series, we noticed that the strongly-typed id was serialized to JSON in an unexpected way:
{ &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;value&amp;quot;: 1 }, &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Apple&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;unitPrice&amp;quot;: 0.8 } When you think about it, it’s not really unexpected: the strongly-typed id is a “complex” object, not a primitive type, so it makes sense that it’s serialized as an object. But it’s clearly not what we want… Let’s see how to fix that.</description>

      <title>Every Model Learned by Gradient Descent Is Approximately a Kernel Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00152</link>
      <description>Deep learning&amp;#39;s successes are often attributed to its ability to
automatically discover new representations of the data, rather than relying on
handcrafted features like other learning methods. We show, however, that deep
networks learned by the standard gradient descent algorithm are in fact
mathematically approximately equivalent to kernel machines, a learning method
that simply memorizes the data and uses it directly for prediction via a
similarity function (the kernel). This greatly enhances the interpretability of
deep network weights, by elucidating that they are effectively a superposition
of the training examples. The network architecture incorporates knowledge of
the target function into the kernel. This improved understanding should lead to
better learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Apple’s “EDR” Brings High Dynamic Range to Non-HDR Displays — Prolost</title>
      <link>https://prolost.com/blog/edr</link>
      <description>Apple caused quite a stir with the announcement of their Pro Display XDR, a High Dynamic Range display that occupies a convoluted space in the market. It seeks to be both a Very Nice Computer Display, and a reference HDR video monitor — but by most measures it’s far too expensive to be the former, and not quite up to the rarified specs of the latter. Confusingly, it also outperforms some HDR displays costing considerably more, by some metrics. It’s currently the only display-only device Apple makes, and it’s simultaneously ludicrously expensive and a too-good-to-be-true deal. Suffice it to say that while there may be very few people for whom the Pro Display XDR is the unquestionably right choice, they know who they are, and they don’t need the internet’s advice about it.</description>
