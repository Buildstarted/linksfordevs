      <title>That time I 10x’d a TI-84 emulator’s speed by replacing a switch-case</title>
      <link>https://artemis.sh/2022/08/07/emulating-calculators-fast-in-js.html</link>
      <description>There’s a javascript emulator for the TI83+, TI84+, and TI84+CSE calculators called jsTIfied, which was written by Christopher Mitchell, founder of the calculator fan site cemetech.net. There’s not a whole lot of reasons to use it over something else if you’ve got a native option available, but if you don’t it’s pretty great. I got interested because it was the first emulator to support the TI84+CSE when that calculator was released in the early 2010s. The CSE was exciting because it retrofitted a 320x240 color display onto the hardware platform of the 84+SE, so all the other hardware and OS access was the same except for graphics. I wanted to be one of the first game developers for the CSE, but developing for the calculator without an emulator and debugger is pretty painful, so I tried out jsTIfied with my older calculator ROMs to get a feel for it.</description>

      <title>The Case of the Mysterious Holes on the Seafloor</title>
      <link>https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/news/oer-updates/2022/mysterious-holes-seafloor/mysterious-holes-seafloor.html</link>
      <description>During Dive 04 of the second Voyage to the Ridge 2022 expedition, we observed several sublinear sets of holes in the sediment on the seafloor at a depth of approximately 2,540 meters (1.6 miles). While the holes look almost human made, the little piles of sediment around them suggest they had been excavated. We attempted but were not able to take a peek into the holes and poke them with the tools on the remotely operated vehicle. It was also not apparent as to whether the holes were connected beneath the sediment surface.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core MVC Views not Resolving Partial Views outside of the default ControllerContext</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Aug/08/ASPNET-Core-MVC-Views-not-Resolving-when-Rendering-Partials-outside-of-the-default-ControllerContext</link>
      <description>I recently ran into a problem with ASP.NET Core MVC views where rendering a Parent View in a Controller Context other than the originally designed context won&amp;#39;t find Child Views that are referenced with no or local or relative paths. It turns out that ASP.NET Core MVC does not resolve local View paths as expected when rendering a View from a different ControllerContext instead using the current controller&amp;#39;s context paths, rather than the view relative paths. In this post I describe why this can be a problem and several ways to work around this problem.</description>

      <description>In a startling disruption of the space-time continuum — and a violation of the basic maxim of publishing that nothing is ever on time — the publication date of the 2nd edition of my book Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software was bumped up by 12 days. That means that the publication date is today and the book might be available from your favorite book vendor. (Or perhaps not quite yet.)</description>

      <title>#16: The case of fake IMDb credits</title>
      <link>https://peabee.substack.com/p/16-the-case-of-fake-imdb-credits</link>
      <description>I was casually browsing IMDb when I landed on the page for an upcoming Ranbir Kapoor starrer movie “Animal”. I saw the cast details and I found a face and a name I didn’t recognize. Finding out about this guy led me to a whole new world of how so many young Indian men from small towns are gaming the system to manufacture their own fake online clout.</description>

      <title>Why Putting Solar Canopies on Parking Lots Is a Smart Green Move</title>
      <link>https://e360.yale.edu/features/putting-solar-panels-atop-parking-lots-a-green-energy-solution</link>
      <description>Solar farms are proliferating on undeveloped land, often harming ecosystems. But placing solar canopies on large parking lots offers a host of advantages — making use of land that is already cleared, producing electricity close to those who need it, and even shading cars.</description>
