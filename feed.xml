      <title>DIY lighted arrow nocks</title>
      <link>https://tegowerk.eu/posts/nocks/</link>
      <description>But first, a demo! Click the image to see the full-size (potato-quality) clip:
Winter is coming. I normally visit my club’s 3D archery range either early in the morning before work, or in the evening after, but with the lengthening dark it’s getting harder and harder to spot my arrows in the targets1. Lighted nocks to the rescue!
Component-wise, a lighted nock is just an LED and a battery inserted in an ordinary transparent nock, but the trick is getting the LED to turn on only upon release, so that you don’t walk through the forest looking like a Christmas tree, but also to conserve batteries.</description>

      <link>https://linderud.dev/blog/store-ssh-keys-inside-the-tpm-ssh-tpm-agent/</link>
      <description>After writing age-plugin-tpm a friend of mine at the hackerspace was super excited to finally have easy file encryption with TPM sealed keys, all without having to rely on gnupg. “This is great!” he said.
“I wish I could have my SSH keys sealed in a TPM just as easily”.
We should have left it at that.
I shouldn’t have replied with a random assortment of facts like “I know google/go-tpm now”, or “but Go has a ssh-agent protocol implementation” followed-up with “Filippo has already implemented yubikey-agent, it can’t be that hard”.</description>

      <title>Tales from the .NET Migration Trenches - Our First Views</title>
      <link>https://www.jimmybogard.com/tales-from-the-net-migration-trenches-our-first-views/</link>
      <description>Posts in this series:

 * Intro
 * Cataloging
 * Empty Proxy
 * Shared Library
 * Our First Controller
 * Migrating Initial Business Logic
 * Our First Views

Back when we looked at our first controller, we tried out the &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot; migration and the controllers migrated just fine but our views did not:

&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;viewport&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;@ViewBag.Title - My ASP.&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Today I found out that google docs infects html exports with spyware, no scripts, but links in your document are replaced with invisible google tracking redirects. I was using their software because a friend wanted me to work with him on a google doc, he is a pretty big fan of their software, but we were both somehow absolutely shocked that they would go that far.</description>
