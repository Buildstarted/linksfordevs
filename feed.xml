      <description>The second block has more real work going on.  If the character stored
in the variable _ does not match the first character of the
string a, the code recurses in such a way that this same block
of code will again be entered.  That is, t=-65 forces a return
to the if (t &amp;lt; -50) block.  The recursion steps through string
a, character by character.  When finally _ == a, the
character at a+31 is printed and returned.</description>

      <title>Christmas Countdown: #1 The Grand Finale. Going headless without using your head!</title>
      <link>https://www.codeart.dk/blog/2023/12/christmas-countdown-1-the-grand-finale.-going-headless-without-using-your-head</link>
      <description>In 2014 the term &amp;#39;headless cms&amp;#39; was coined - and presented as a cool new &amp;#39;feature&amp;#39; in the Web CMS industry. And it quickly became a hot buzzword for a few years later. In a few days it&amp;#39;s 2024 and we can celebrate that it&amp;#39;s been a concept for 10 years. Strangely, I still encounter new implementations that want to go &amp;#39;headless&amp;#39; based on an almost religious belief that it&amp;#39;s the new cool thing.</description>

      <title>How to build a windmill &amp;#183; Jacques Mattheij</title>
      <link>https://jacquesmattheij.com/how-to-build-a-windmill/</link>
      <description>Windmills have always fascinated me and for a long time I was dreaming of one day building my own. Where I live there are still machines from the 1600’s that are just as magnificent today as when they were first built. When you see one standing in a field rotating and converting passing air into usable energy they look like simplicity incarnate, but nothing could be further from the truth.</description>

      <title>Maybe you don&amp;#39;t need SRE</title>
      <link>https://blog.mbrt.dev/posts/no-need-sre/</link>
      <description>Running a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) organization correctly is difficult and expensive. Spare the frustration, perhaps what you need is Sysadmins.
Since the term was coined by Ben Treynor in 2003 at Google, lots of ink was spent on praising SRE practices. Not enough on when it is appropriate to have SREs. This post is a take on that angle.
Disclaimer: I was an SRE at Google and this piece represents only my own views.</description>
