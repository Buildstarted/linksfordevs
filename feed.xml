      <title>The APL Quest Series | Dyalog Blog</title>
      <link>https://www.dyalog.com/blog/2024/03/the-apl-quest-series/</link>
      <description>It seemed like a normal Friday until mid-afternoon. But on 4 February 2022, I embarked on a journey that, at the time, seemed to stretch impossibly far into the future — a future that wasn’t entirely known yet. In the APL Orchard chat room on Stack Exchange, a dozen APLers, some experts and some newbies, held the very first APL Quest chat event.</description>

      <title>Designing File Formats</title>
      <link>https://fadden.com/tech/file-formats.html</link>
      <description>There are many, many file formats, largely owing to the existence of many,
many different kinds of files.&amp;#160; They range from simple ASCII text documents
to complex databases.&amp;#160; There are a few elements that should be part of any
structured file, but many designers fail to include them.</description>

      <title>Explorations in creating a basic text editor: the foundation — Asko N&amp;#245;mm</title>
      <link>https://nth.ee/explorations-in-creating-a-basic-text-editor</link>
      <description>As part of the development of Sember I&amp;#39;ve long thought I&amp;#39;d like to try create a text editor of my own, completely from scratch, that would then be used as the Paragraph block in the post editor. Currently that role is played by the Markdown block, which is how I&amp;#39;m writing this very blog post, but I personally always liked visual editing a lot more than Markdown, it&amp;#39;s just that Markdown was a quick and dirty way to get to writing blog posts in Sember.</description>

      <title>How web bloat impacts users with slow devices</title>
      <link>https://danluu.com/slow-device/</link>
      <description>In 2017, we looked at how web bloat affects users with slow connections. Even in the U.S., many users didn&amp;#39;t have broadband speeds, making much of the web difficult to use. It&amp;#39;s still the case that many users don&amp;#39;t have broadband speeds, both inside and outside of the U.S. and that much of the modern web isn&amp;#39;t usable for people with slow internet, but the exponential increase in bandwidth (Neilsen suggests this is 50% per year for high-end connections) has outpaced web bloat for typical sites, making this less of a problem than it was in 2017, although it&amp;#39;s still a serious problem for people with poor connections.</description>

      <description>While I was cleaning my personal files, I found my earliest programming
projects, which are over a decade old. I decided to do a code review for fun. Do
you know that feeling of reading code that’s only vaguely familiar, being mildly
horrified, and then realizing that you were in fact the one who wrote it? Yeah,
I got that a lot while looking at this code. Here are the highlights from three
projects: forex trading, The Daily Lore, and MovieSeer.</description>

      <title>Achieving awful compression with digits of pi</title>
      <link>https://ntietz.com/blog/why-we-cant-compress-messages-with-pi/</link>

People have long hypothesized that pi is one such number; a proof remains elusive.</description>

      <title>How I Built a Bootstrapped Consulting Company: From Zero To 60k€ Revenue</title>
      <link>https://www.eidel.io/building-consulting-company-60k/</link>
      <description>I’m part of a few incubators where I mingle with future startup founders and pretend to have knowledge on how to build a startup. Generally speaking, I perceive myself as being relatively clueless, but then again, when the founders ask me some questions, I briefly think that I actually have something useful to share.</description>

      <title>failing miserably to scale kubes</title>
      <link>https://breadchris.com/blog/failing-miserably-to-scale-kubes/</link>
      <description>I run a cyber security competition for high schoolers every year. Yesterday was the 7th iteration. Months of planning go into designing the story and putting together digital evidence for the competitors to try to solve a murder mystery. It was a special event because the organizers who built it for my high school self stoked my passion for security. Unfortunately, it did not go as planned this year. After giving the introduction talk to 350 students, the site got DOSed from the concurrent load of everyone accessing it.</description>
