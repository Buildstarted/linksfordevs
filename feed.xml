      <link>https://www.type-driven.org.uk/edwinb/why-is-idris-2-so-much-faster-than-idris-1.html</link>
      <description>I've just released a new version of Idris 2, which is a
significant release in that it's the first one which is able to compile itself.
Thus, it's the first one where we can really see how the performance of Idris 2
improves on the performance of Idris 1.</description>

      <link>https://www.meziantou.net/don-t-use-method-with-side-effect-in-linq.htm</link>
      <description>The author of this GitHub issue is complaining about the behavior or FirstOrDefault when it's following an OrderBy.
Indeed, the predicate is called on each element which is not what he expected. In his example the predicate has a side-effect so he really doesn't want the method to be
called for each element.
var account = accounts.OrderBy(x =&gt; x.UsageCount).FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; x.TryReserve(token));
