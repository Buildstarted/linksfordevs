      <title>Wolves make roadways safer, generating large economic returns to predator conservation</title>
      <link>https://www.pnas.org/content/118/22/e2023251118</link>
      <description>Measuring the economic benefits conveyed by predators is difficult—often, effects are indirect and operate through complex ecological changes. As a result, debates about the expansion of predators have pit salient costs against more speculative estimates of benefits that might be dismissed as unreliable or ideologically motivated. We quantify the indirect benefits of wolves ( Canis lupus ) to human lives and property through reductions in deer-vehicle collisions. Moreover, we decompose the effect into two components: changes in prey behavior versus prey abundance. This decomposition is important when effective policy depends on whether hunters can replicate the effects of predators. In the case of wolves, we conclude that human deer hunters cannot.

The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available in Dryad at &amp;lt;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.g4f4qrfp8&amp;gt;. This paper does not use any custom algorithms.</description>

      <description>Quick little video about an interesting new logging related feature coming in .NET 6, compile-time logging source generation, as well as related high-performance logging features, which were already present but probably not very well known.</description>

      <title>LLVM relicensing update &amp;amp; call for help</title>
      <link>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2021-11-18-relicensing-update/</link>
      <description>In this blog post, I’d like to summarize the main points I talked about in the relicensing update presentation at the 2021 LLVM Developer’s meeting.
The very short summary is that we are currently in the long tail phase of collecting relicensing agreements of past contributors.</description>

      <title>Documenting HTTP requests with Hurl</title>
      <link>https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2021/11/06/hurl/</link>
      <description>I don’t really remember anymore how I stumbled upon Hurl but nevermind that, it looks awesome! It’s basically a wrapper around cURL that allows you to write a handful of HTTP requests into a single plaintext file and execute them. You can then add assertions for responses and also pass data from one response to follow-up requests.</description>

      <title>Empowering teams are like career accelerators</title>
      <link>https://bruno-oliveira.github.io/techblog/Empowering-teams/</link>
      <description>I follow several technical people whose stances on tech I can identify with in a few platforms, and, by far, Gergely Orosz has been one of the most influential people I’ve decided to follow, and, I’m glad I did! As a former Uber manager his posts and insights are always extremely interesting to read. Some of the topics are geared towards senior ICs or people who are on track to become managers or who have more people responsibilities than a standard IC, but, at least recently, I’ve found for myself that you can always take away something valuable from such articles, even if you aren’t yet at that level. 
This is a bit in-line with the Stackoverflow article about growing by doing stretch assignments.
