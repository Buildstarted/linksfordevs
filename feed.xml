      <title>Comparing Svelte and React - Jack Franklin</title>
      <link>https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/comparing-svelte-and-react-javascript/</link>
      <description>Last year I created Pomodone, a small time tracking application based on the Pomodoro technique of working in 25 minute intervals. It&amp;#39;s a pretty basic app; it has a 25 minute timer (that runs in a Web Worker) and saves a history of your &amp;quot;poms&amp;quot; to a small Firebase database. I initially built it using React (well, Preact actually) but I then started to play around with Svelte, and decided rebuilding the app in Svelte might be a nice way to blog about the similarities and differences between the libraries.</description>

      <title>Understanding JSON Schema — Understanding JSON Schema 7.0 documentation</title>
      <link>https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/</link>
      <description>JSON Schema is a powerful tool for validating the structure of JSON
data.  However, learning to use it by reading its specification is
like learning to drive a car by looking at its blueprints.  You don’t
need to know how an electric motor fits together if all
you want to do is pick up the groceries.  This book, therefore, aims
to be the friendly driving instructor for JSON Schema.  It’s for those
that want to write it and understand it, but maybe aren’t interested
in building their own car—er, writing their own JSON Schema
validator—just yet.</description>

      <link>https://www.fws.gov/birds/news/210324eagle-population.php</link>
      <description>WASHINGTON –&amp;#160;Populations of the American bald eagle — the bold national symbol of the United States — have quadrupled since 2009, according to a new report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its partners. Bald eagles once teetered on the brink of extinction, reaching an all-time low of 417 known nesting pairs in 1963 in the lower 48 states. However, after decades of protection, the banning of the pesticide DDT, and conservation efforts with numerous partners, the bald eagle population has flourished, growing to more than 71,400 nesting pairs.</description>

      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Patrik Svensson, creator of both the Cake Build System, and a .NET library called Spectre.Console. We mostly chatted about the Spectre Console library, which adds AMAZING functionality to .NET console apps (grid, charts, images, and much more!). We also touched on Cake and Cake Frosting.

      <title>The worst so-called “best practice” for Docker</title>
      <link>https://pythonspeed.com/articles/security-updates-in-docker/</link>
      <description>Somebody is always wrong on the Internet, and bad Docker packaging advice is quite common. But one particular piece of advice keeps coming up, and it’s dangerous enough to merit its own article. In a whole bunch of places you will be told not to install security updates when building your Docker image. This advice is given by the official Docker docs’ best practices page: Avoid RUN apt-get upgrade and dist-upgrade, as many of the “essential” packages from the parent images cannot upgrade inside an unprivileged container. To be clear: RUN commands happen during image build, not during container startup. The documentation there is saying “build your images without installing security updates”. You’ll see the same advice in the hadolint Dockerfile linter (it cites the above), and you’ll even see it in the OWASP Docker cheatsheet: Avoid the use of apt/apk upgrade For the vast majority of people creating Dockerfiles this is absolutely awful advice. And since this bad advice is so common, let’s consider some of the justifications and why they are wrong.</description>

      <link>https://fieldofvision.org/do-not-split</link>
      <description>Told from within the heart of the Hong Kong protests, “Do Not Split” begins in 2019 as a proposed bill allowing the Chinese government to extradite criminal suspects to mainland China escalated protests throughout Hong Kong. Unfolding across a year, “Do Not Split” captures the determination and sacrifices of the protesters, the government’s backlash, and the passage of the new Beijing-backed national security law.</description>
