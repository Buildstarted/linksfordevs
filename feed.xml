      <title>How do cars fare in crash tests they're not specifically optimized for?</title>
      <link>https://danluu.com/car-safety/</link>
      <description>Any time you have a benchmark that gets taken seriously, some people will start gaming the benchmark. Some famous examples in computing are the CPU benchmark specfp and video game benchmarks. With specfp, Sun managed to increase its score on 179.art (a sub-benchmark of specfp) by 12x with a compiler tweak that essentially re-wrote the benchmark kernel, which increased the Sun UltraSPARC’s overall specfp score by 20%. At times, GPU vendors have added specialized benchmark-detecting code to their drivers that lowers image quality during benchmarking to produce higher benchmark scores. Of course, gaming the benchmark isn't unique to computing and we see people do this in other fields. It’s not surprising that we see this kind of behavior since improving benchmark scores by cheating on benchmarks is much cheaper (and therefore higher ROI) than improving benchmark scores by actually improving the product.</description>

      <description>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see predictionbook.com. With that in mind. I […]</description>

      <title>Disclosure: Another macOS privacy protections bypass</title>
      <link>https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/disclosure2.html</link>
      <description>Today I'm disclosing a macOS privacy protections bypass. (You may recall that I disclosed another one last year.) The privacy protections system (also known as TCC: Transparency, Consent, and Control) was introduced in macOS Mojave, and one of its purposes is to protect certain files on your Mac from access by unauthorized apps. I've discovered a way for an unauthorized app to read the contents of protected files, thus bypassing the privacy protections. This issue exists in Mojave, Catalina, and the Big Sur beta. It remains unaddressed and is therefore, in one sense, a zero-day. Here's the timeline leading to my disclosure:</description>

      <title>GOTO 2018 • Machine Learning: Alchemy for the Modern Computer Scientist • Erik Meijer</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs0uRQJdIcg</link>
      <description>This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2018. #gotocon #gotocph

Erik Meijer - Think Like A Fundamentalist, Code Like A Hacker

ABSTRACT
In ancient times, the dream of alchemists was to mutate ordinary metals such as lead into noble metals such as gold. However, by using classic mathematics, modern physicists and chemists are much more successful in understanding and transforming matter than alchemists ever dreamt of.
The situation in software seems to be the opposite. Modern computer scientists have been unsuccessful in their quest to reliably turn formal specifications into code and to accurately understand the mechanics of side-effecting computation. On the other hand, software alchemists, by using classic mathematics, have been extremely successful in mutating training data into pure functions using various machine learning techniques, in particular deep learning.
Mechanically learning code from training data is often referred to as "Software 2.0" or "Learning-based development". This new paradigm of software creation will require a radical rethinking of the ancestral software engineering and imperative programming practices that have been developed in the second half of the last century.
In this talk we will discuss how we are building new probabilistic frameworks and differentiable programming languages [...]

      <title>How conspiracy theories emerge—and how their storylines fall apart</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2020-06-conspiracy-theories-emergeand-storylines-fall.html</link>
      <description>A new study by UCLA professors offers a new way to understand how unfounded conspiracy theories emerge online. The research, which combines sophisticated artificial intelligence and a deep knowledge of how folklore is structured, explains how unrelated facts and false information can connect into a narrative framework that would quickly fall apart if some of those elements are taken out of the mix.</description>

      <title>IRL to Anime With Cartoonization AI</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRE4QZAXYu4&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description>I was absolutely speechless when I found White-Box-Cartoonization AI. Both in agony and joy.
So here I am making another video on roughly the same concept, but at the end, I think it is definitely worth it as this AI is so much better and deserves a video of its own.

      <title>Superstimulus in 2020</title>
      <link>https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/06/24/superstimulus.html</link>
      <description>During these COVID-19 stay-at-home days, I’ve watched a lot of movies, old and new. Many cultural shifts are caught on film over the decades, but I’ve been most surprised by the change in pacing. In films from the 70s, individual scenes are long. They’re filled with pensive pauses and close-ups, and you get entire minute-long shots of pure framing and mood-setting. Movies from recent years have fast cuts, with not a single moment wasted. A modern feature-length film feels much denser in the sheer amount of content and audiovisual spectacle it gives to the audience.</description>

      <title>Exposing a custom type as a JSON string in an ASP.NET Core API</title>
      <link>https://thomaslevesque.com/2020/06/27/exposing-custom-type-as-json-string-in-asp-net-core-api/</link>
      <description>Sometimes your API needs to expose a non-primitive type that has a “natural” string representation. For instance, a standard representation for a duration is the ISO 8601 format, where “1 month, 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes” can be represented as P1M2DT3H4M (note that this isn’t the same as a Timespan, which has no notion of calendar months and years). A duration could be represented in C# as a custom type, like the Duration structure in my Iso8601DurationHelper project.</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago a paper titled Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved
Quality, Stability, and Variation
cropped up on my reading list. It describes growing generative adversarial
networks
progressively, starting with low-resolution images, and then building up more
detail as training goes on. It got quite a bit of press at the time because the
authors used their idea to generate realistic, unique images of human faces.</description>
