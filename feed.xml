      <title>Writing new guards with extensions in C# 14</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/e2552b7a-293a-4f46-892f-95a0cd677e4d</link>
      <description>In C# we have many nice guards sitting on top of static exceptions classes like ArgumentNullException, ArgumentOutOfRangeException, etc: As ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty, ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrWhiteSpace. Now we can extend them easily!

      <title>Why We Think</title>
      <link>https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2025-05-01-thinking/</link>
      <description>Special thanks to John Schulman for a lot of super valuable feedback and direct edits on this post.
Test time compute (Graves et al. 2016, Ling, et al. 2017, Cobbe et al. 2021) and Chain-of-thought (CoT) (Wei et al. 2022, Nye et al. 2021), have led to significant improvements in model performance, while raising many research questions. This post aims to review recent developments in how to effectively use test-time compute (i.e. ‚Äúthinking time‚Äù) and why it helps.</description>

      <title>You should not write library style code! (probably) ‚Äì Wilsons Blog</title>
      <link>https://wilsoniumite.com/2025/05/17/you-should-not-write-library-code-probably/</link>
      <description>When I really got into writing code (big projects, or for work), I really started using libraries. For so many problems, there was already a library that would help me with it. From doing maths fast with numpy to padding strings with left-pad, there was almost always a library that could help. Even now half the time you want to integrate your app with some other application it ships its API as a small library of useful functions. As much as I do like writing code to solve difficult problems, the project manager in my head is telling me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt reinvent the wheel‚Äù, so naturally I use a lot of libraries.</description>

      <title>What would happen if I blocked big search?</title>
      <link>https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2025/blocking-big-search/</link>
      <description>The major search engines are showing slop summaries first and websites second. They link to sites sometimes, but they‚Äôd much prefer searchers stay on the results page and ask followup questions. Engagement numbers and all that.
These companies run mass content scraping campaigns to train their own slop models and provide servers to other slop companies in the same data centers their crawlers operate from. Every word I‚Äôve thrown into this illustrious publication‚Äîthe reading of which a total of five people have, at various times, expressed mild enjoyment‚Äîhas been both silently and explicitly declared fair game by the slop companies. The only positive thing I can egotistically hope to grasp about this development is that a distant and diluted abstraction of my words and thoughts could be subtly influencing the thoughts and decisions of people around the world‚Äîthe same way a pinch of salt would affect the flavor profile of a large vat at the soup factory, or like the breeze under the wings of chaos theory‚Äôs cute and frighteningly powerful butterfly mascot.</description>
