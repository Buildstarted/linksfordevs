      <description>This post is written by Anitha Deenadayalan, Developer Specialist SA, DevAx Modern applications use microservices as an architectural and organizational approach to software development, where the application comprises small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. When multiple microservices collaborate to handle requests, one or more services may become unavailable or exhibit a high latency. […]</description>

      <description>Alone in a room with the customer’s CTO, I said “So, I spent this morning talking to your people, and it looks like
    you’re using low-level generic tech for everything and managing it yourself.  You could save a shit-ton of money by
    using high-level managed services and get load-scaling for free.” 

    “Yeah,” he said, “but then we’d be locked in and the next time
    our enterprise contract comes up for renewal, you can screw us.”</description>

      <title>DIY web analytics with EndTRACKER - Julio Merino (jmmv.dev)</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/diy-web-analytics.html</link>
      <description>One thing that had been bothering me about my websites&amp;amp;mdash;including this blog, but especially when launching https://www.endbasic.dev/ just a few months ago&amp;amp;mdash;was this:
 uBlock showing a warning that it blocked a tracker on the EndBASIC site.  A tracking warning. uBlock complained that my properties had one tracker. And it&amp;amp;rsquo;s true they had just one: it was Google Analytics, or GA for short.
GA is the de-facto standard for web analytics: it is extremely powerful and ubiquitous.</description>

      <title>Strong Password Enforcement – Josh Betz</title>
      <link>https://josh.blog/2022/02/strong-password-enforcement</link>
      <description>Modern web applications have a responsibility to prevent their users from using easily compromised passwords. I would also say that it’s in their best interest, although it’s certainly a trade off. Most people still don’t use password managers, so stricter requirements will lead to some people losing access to their accounts. Still though, forcing people to use even moderately strong passwords will help prevent account takeovers and all the headaches that go along with them.</description>

      <description>After 25 years of working for, on and with the web, I am looking at the current state of it and I don’t like it. There is still a lot of beautiful, creative and amazing work out there, but on the whole, we lost an amazing opportunity. In its place we have a consumption machine that creates bubbles and assumes new users to be incapable of making own decisions.</description>

      <title>Reality by Consensus</title>
      <link>https://lockwood.dev/philosophy/2022/01/31/reality-by-consensus.html</link>
      <description>Imagine if you forgot what one of the rooms in your house looked like, and when you returned, it had changed, it was “refreshed”. It had refreshed, not into some absurd wonderland of glowing fungi and strange creatures, but to one consistent with what you believed a room ought to be. Perhaps there was a lightswitch outside, that now instead of turning on the fluorescent globe, turned on a LED one. Maybe the books on the shelves had refreshed, but the ones you remembered and remembered reading, had remained. The size of the room was constrained, because you remembered how long it took to walk around the outside. Given your means and taste, it was appropriately furnished. Perhaps you walked into the room because you forgot where you left your keys, and encountered a lovely couch (green, your favourite) and found the keys wedged between the cushions. This made perfect sense because you remembered sitting in that room. But, when you were there, you actually sat on a red couch, and didn’t have your keys. But, your keys refreshed there, because you forgot where you left them.</description>

      <title>Postgres large JSON value query performance (evanjones.ca)</title>
      <link>https://www.evanjones.ca/postgres-large-json-performance.html</link>
      <description>Postgres supports three types for &amp;quot;schemaless&amp;quot; data: JSON (added in 9.2), JSONB (added in 9.4), and HSTORE (added in 8.2 as an extension). Unfortunately, the performance of queries of all three gets substantially slower (2-10&amp;#215;) for values larger than about 2 kiB, due to how Postgres stores long variable-length data (TOAST). The same performance cliff applies to any variable-length types, like TEXT and BYTEA. This article contains some quick-and-dirty benchmark results to explore how Postgres&amp;#39;s performance changes for the &amp;quot;schemaless&amp;quot; data types when they become large. My conclusion is that you should expect a 2-10&amp;#215; slower queries once a row gets larger than Postgres&amp;#39;s 2 kiB limit.</description>
