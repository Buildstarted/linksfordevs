      <description>In a previous post about ractors, I explained why I think it‚Äôs really unlikely you‚Äôd ever be able to run an entire application inside a ractor, but that they could still be situationally very useful to move CPU-bound work out of the main thread, and to unlock some parallel algorithm.</description>

      <title>Hacker News now runs on top of Common Lisp - Lisp journey</title>
      <link>https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/hacker-news-now-runs-on-top-of-common-lisp/</link>
      <description>Hacker News was written in the Arc lisp dialect, a dialect created by Paul Graham. Arc was implemented on top of Racket, but that has now changed. HN runs on top of SBCL since a few months.But why? For performance reasons. I recently noticed that Hacker News no longer uses paging for long threads. In the past, when a discussion grew large, we had to click &amp;ldquo;More&amp;rdquo; to load the next page of comments, and dang would occasionally post helpful tips to remind us about this feature.</description>

      <link>https://danq.me/2025/05/21/google-shared-my-phone-number/</link>
      <description>When people started calling my personal mobile number with questions about a voluntary organisation I'm involved with, I was confused: we weren't sharing that number. It turns out that Google had decided to take the number I used to verify my identity for Google Business some years prior and start putting it in Google Search results. WTF, Google?</description>

      <title>Avoiding reflection in C# in way unsafer ways!</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/53691229-fbb1-48cf-95e5-f586f9800ee1</link>
      <description>For good reasons, many folks don't want to use reflection. Since .NET 8, we have a better way of dealing with this in most of the cases (when known in advance). But we can go the opposite: Make it even unsafer for a tiny bit performance!
