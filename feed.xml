      <description>Slack Technologies, Inc., (NYSE: WORK) today announced it has filed a competition complaint against Microsoft Corporation before the European Commission. The complaint details Microsoft‚Äôs illegal and anti-competitive practice of abusing its market dominance to extinguish competition in breach of European Union competition law. Microsoft has illegally tied its Teams product into its market-dominant Office productivity suite, force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident that we win on the merits of our product, but we can‚Äôt ignore illegal behavior that deprives customers of access to the tools and solutions they want,‚Äù said Jonathan Prince, Vice President of Communications and Policy at Slack. ‚ÄúSlack threatens Microsoft‚Äôs hold on business email, the cornerstone of Office, which means Slack threatens Microsoft‚Äôs lock on enterprise software.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut this is much bigger than Slack versus Microsoft ‚Äì this is a proxy</description>

      <description>Amazon Ion is a richly-typed, self-describing, hierarchical data serialization format offering interchangeable binary and text representations. Ion was built to address rapid development, decoupling, and efficiency challenges faced every day while engineering large-scale, service-oriented architectures.

      <title>Microsoft Campus Tours - Inside the NEW Channel 9 Studio</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HxnXO3YwMo&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description>A little bit over a year ago, Golnaz, Kaitlin, and Matthew crawled out of a windowless studio and saw the sun for the first time in years. Their old manager, Larry, decided to help rebuild a studio so they could see the sun more regularly. Thus, the new Channel 9 Studio was born.

After a year of enjoying their new digs, Golnaz, Kaitlin, and Matthew, joined by Cameron and Christina, want to show you around. It's like a housewarming, but with minimal social interaction, zero small talk, and you don't need to leave the comfort of your own couch. Enjoy.</description>

      <link>https://phillipcarter.dev/posts/five-years-at-microsoft.html</link>
      <description>As of this month, I will have been employed at Microsoft for 5 years. I joined the .NET team when I
                    was 24
                    years old. Now at 29, I'm still here and thoroughly enjoying it. It's been a great time overall.
                    I've learned so much more than
                    I ever would have imagined, met so many wonderful people, and helped make some things that people
                    enjoy. Here's what I remember the most in those years.</description>
