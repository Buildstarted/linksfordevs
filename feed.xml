      <title>Introducing Bandersnatch: a fast elliptic curve built over the BLS12-381 scalar field - Cryptography - Ethereum Research</title>
      <link>https://ethresear.ch/t/introducing-bandersnatch-a-fast-elliptic-curve-built-over-the-bls12-381-scalar-field/9957</link>
      <description>Bandersnatch by Simon Masson (Anoma - https://anoma.network/) and Antonio Sanso (Ethereum Foundation - https://ethereum.foundation/)  This document describes the details of Bandersnatch  a new elliptic curve built over the BLS12-381 scalar field. The curve is similar to Jubjub but is equipped with the GLV endomorphism hence it has faster scalar multiplication.      BlS12-381 and Jubjub BLS12-381 is a pairing friendly curve created by Sean Bowe in 2017. Currently BLS12-381 is universally recogni...</description>

      <title>Stewardship of Ourselves</title>
      <link>https://berjon.com/stewardship/</link>
      <description>Working behind the scenes in the news media sector, it has become increasingly clear to me that tech and the internet as they operate today are causing structural damage to our collective institutions that runs deeper than seems to be understood. But these changes can be hard to characterise. If you take advertising revenue from high-quality contexts and use it to subsidise conspiracy theories, it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious that nothing good will happen — but we barely have an understanding of the data economy sufficient to put a critique of this transfer on solid footing. If you move editorial decisions about what information people get to see first from tens of thousands of career editors working with methods that are highly diversified in biases, culture, skill, or politics the world around to a tiny number of algorithms that are everywhere uniform, what effect can you expect? Reputational and market-driven accountability will be removed, which is evidently bad, but the massive simplification of this ecosystem seems very likely to have deep-running consequences of its own — but how do you begin proving that? A new paper in PNAS leads the way forward.</description>
