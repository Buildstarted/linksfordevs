      <title>What are you doing, WordPress.com?</title>
      <link>https://rootprivileges.net/2022/04/03/what-are-you-doing-wordpress-com/</link>
      <description>I recently wrote that I&amp;#39;ve stuck with WordPress.com for so long, for all its purported limitations, because its features fully suffice the committed blogger whose content is textual for the most part and because the company behind WordPress.com is running a good business, with the right ideals.

      <link>https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-lifetime-annotations-for-c/61377</link>
      <description>Martin Br&amp;#230;nne @martinboehme  Rosica Dejanovska @scentini  G&amp;#225;bor Horv&amp;#225;th @Xazax-hun  Dmitri Gribenko @gribozavr  Luca Versari @veluca93   Summary We are designing, implementing, and evaluating an attribute-based annotation scheme for C++ that describes object lifetime contracts.

It allows other static analysis algorithms to be less conservative in their mod...</description>
