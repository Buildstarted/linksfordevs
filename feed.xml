      <title>Reorient GitHub Pull Requests Around Changesets</title>
      <link>https://mitchellh.com/writing/github-changesets</link>

and everything smaller. Through those experiences up to today, GitHub pull
requests is where I spend almost all of my time while on GitHub, and to me its
also unfortunately the most frustrating part of GitHub.</description>

      <title>Beginning CMake : Quick Getting Started with CMake</title>
      <link>https://norabellm.github.io/posts/beginning-cmake/</link>
      <description>CMake is build system intented for organize C/C++ project. Not only saving me from write long compiler command to build program, it also become project definition. Cmake handle dependencies, build, compiler selection, testing and many others. If you familiar with GNU Make, this may the niche version of it that specialize to C/C++ code.
CMake works by compiling CMakeList.txt (Your project definition) into native build system such Makefile, ninja, meson or other.</description>

      <title>India Should Switch Off IPv4 Internet</title>
      <link>https://rohanrd.xyz/posts/india-should-switch-off-ipv4-internet/</link>
      <description>IPv6 migration has been dragging on for a decades now and there’s no end in sight for this migration to complete. Huge software companies like Amazon are buying even more IPv4 addresses to continue to support IPv4 users. Given the current stance of corporations and many governments it seems that Internet will forever be split into two protocols.
Worldwide 45% of Internet users are on IPv6. This number is quite low if you take into consideration the fact that IPv6 was created almost 3 decades ago.</description>
