      <title>Lessons I learned from senior engineers</title>
      <link>https://memooo.ooo/posts/senior-engineers/</link>
      <description>“Why is this important”? Good senior engineers always ask “why” this feature, or function or even project is necessary.
Understanding “why” allows them to make decisions on “what” to do, “how” to do it and even how to take shortcuts to get there.
They also understand “why” target users would want these features in the first place.
Clear communication Good senior engineers always strive to be good communicators.
They document everything, from code to the decision making process and agreements between people involved in a project.</description>
