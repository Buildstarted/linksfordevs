      <description>OOXML is less an act of sabotage than the continuation of a flawed, inelegant lineage.</description>

      <title>Drive manually</title>
      <link>https://blog.julik.nl/2025/09/driving-by-hand</link>
      <description>On the 30th of August, 2000, a train flew out of the tunnel at a station in Paris, and, without stopping, rolled on through into the tunnel. It was clear that the train was speeding, and speeding severely. Inside the tunnel, the train has derailed with the front cab car turning over. Luckily, there were no fatalities. 24 people were injured. The investigation was able to establish that the train’s speed was above the maximum permitted on that section of track by 20 km/h, if not more. How could this happen, given that the Paris Metro has been equipped with automatic speed control since the early 70s?</description>

      <title>Parameters and binding forms should be mutually recursive</title>
      <link>https://samestep.com/blog/parameter-syntax/</link>
      <description>Some programming languages let you define functions that are easy to
            call with more structure than a flat argument list, whether via
            keyword arguments, tuples, records, or some nesting of those. But I
            don't know any language that makes it very nice to define such
            functions:</description>

      <title>What to do with an old iPad</title>
      <link>http://odb.ar/blog/2025/09/05/hosting-my-blog-on-an-iPad-2.html</link>
      <description>I recently inherited my parents’ old iPad 2. It had iOS 9 on it and was barely usable, in part due to how slow it was but mostly because of old SSL certificates and apps stopping support. But I wanted to give it some life because I hate to see a working machine go to waste. So I asked around and got a great answer: The iPad 2 can be downgraded to iOS 6.1.3 or 8.4.1. Both offer better performance than iOS 9 and have untethered jailbreaks. Once downgraded and jailbroken you can sideload hours and hours worth of games. A lot from that era are IAP-free.</description>

      <title>How and why I built an MCP server for Svelte - Stanislav Khromov</title>
      <link>https://khromov.se/how-and-why-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-svelte/</link>
      <description>If you’re using Svelte with coding assistants, you know that these assistants aren’t always aware of the latest features in Svelte 5 and SvelteKit. They’ll suggest outdated patterns, mix up the old reactive syntax with the new runes system, or simply hallucinate syntax that doesn’t exist. These problems have made LLM assistants less useful in Svelte and SvelteKit projects – so I decided to set out and build an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives AI assistants direct access to the latest Svelte documentation. Demo: What can it actually do? Here’s a short video I recorded demonstrating some of […]</description>
