      <title>ongoing by Tim Bray &amp;#183; Algorithm Agility?</title>
      <link>https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/04/24/Algorithm-Agility</link>
      <description>What happened was, I was fooling around with zero-knowledge proof ideas and needed to post public keys on the Internet in
    textual form.
    I picked
    ed25519 keys (elliptic-curve, also known as EdDSA) so I asked the Internet
    “How do you turn ed25519 keys into short 
    text strings?” The answer took quite a bit of work to find and, after I posted it, provoked a discussion about whether I was
    doing the right thing. So today’s question is: Should these things be encoded with the traditional PKIX/PEM serialization, or
    should developers just blast the key-bits into base64 and ship that?</description>
