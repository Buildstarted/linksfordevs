      <title>Differential Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258</link>
      <description>Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. In this work, we introduce Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention patterns. Experimental results on language modeling show that Diff Transformer outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and training tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages in practical applications, such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reduction of activation outliers. By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff Transformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text summarization. For in-context learning, Diff Transformer not only enhances accuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was considered as a chronic robustness issue. The results position Diff Transformer as a highly effective and promising architecture to advance large language models.</description>

      <title>Can AI detect the direction of harm? Building a model for message moderation on social media platforms</title>
      <link>https://lijiayong.github.io/posts/direction_of_harm/</link>
      <description>Introduction I got fascinated by mental health Discord servers and forums, they present a great potential for peer support and group healing. However, people in certain distressed states sometimes inadvertently hurt others or themselves. Even by detailing a horrific and traumatic event one can re-traumatize other people who went through similar experiences. This problem is especially salient for direct messages, where there are no moderators to intervene–we can only rely on users’ reporting after the harm is dealt. How do we protect users from harm? Hence I set out to solve the message moderation problem with AI.</description>

What if I told you there was a whole genre of software where all the fruit still hangs low?

      <description>The Wordpress and open source communities have lots of thoughts on Matt Mullenweg’s actions after his talk at WordCamp. Much of this commentary has overlooked what I think is a core concern at the heart of Matt’s argument: the growing role and influence of private equity in tech, particularly in open source.
PE firms raise money from institutional investors and high net worth individuals to buy companies, restructure them, and sell them later for a profit.</description>

      <description>Working on the Nerves project, the Embedded framework for Elixir, has given me an increased appreciation for how Frank Hunleth and his collaborators through the years have structured things. And while I&amp;#39;ve found crossing into the Linux-heavy part of it difficult and frustrating there has been reasonable steps to take all the way from building the application layer in Elixir all the way back to fighting the bootloader. I&amp;#39;ll try to detail how a Nerves system is built up in this post.</description>
