      <title>Become shell literate</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2020/12/12/Shell-literacy.html</link>
      <description>Shell literacy is one of the most important skills you ought to possess as a
programmer. The Unix shell is one of the most powerful ideas ever put to code,
and should be second nature to you as a programmer. No other tool is nearly as
effective at commanding your computer to perform complex tasks quickly —
or at storing them as scripts you can use later.</description>

      <link>http://paulgraham.com/earnest.html</link>
      <description>Jessica and I have certain words that have special significance
when we&amp;#39;re talking about startups. The highest compliment we can
pay to founders is to describe them as &amp;quot;earnest.&amp;quot; This is not by
itself a guarantee of success. You could be earnest but incapable.
But when founders are both formidable (another of our words) and
earnest, they&amp;#39;re as close to unstoppable as you get.</description>
