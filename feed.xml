      <title>Your phone vs. Supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://www.tnhh.net/posts/phone-power.html</link>
      <description>Today, I looked up how many floating point operations per second (FLOPS) that an iPhone can do. It turns out the A14 chip in the iPhone can do about 11 TFlOPS according to Apple. Let&amp;#39;s give Apple the benefits of the doubt and not get too deep into how they got that number, and put it to perspective and compare the iPhone with the Top 500 Supercomputers in the world over the years:</description>

      <title>The Database Inside Your Codebase</title>
      <link>https://feifan.blog/posts/the-database-inside-your-codebase</link>
      <description>Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer&amp;#39;s time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers&amp;#39; heads. It&amp;#39;s difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack &amp;quot;code browsers&amp;quot; that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we&amp;#39;ll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes.</description>

      <description>Deep learning-based comuter vision models like Inception Net have achieved state-of-the-art performance on image recognition. However, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they don&amp;#39;t have blindspots and biases. Here&amp;#39;s a few of them, along with interactive aplications for you to try it out yourself.</description>

      <title>I Really Blew It | Interactive Storytelling Tools for Writers</title>
      <link>http://www.erasmatazz.com/personal/self/i-really-blew-it.html</link>
      <description>I recently realized that I have been wasting my time on a dumb effort for the last 35 years. It all started back in 1983. My game for the Atari, Eastern Front (1941), had been a big hit, and Dale Yocum of the Atari Program Exchange suggested that I release the source code for it. This was an exciting idea, as nobody had ever release source code for a commercial game before then, and I readily agreed. However, I insisted that the source code be thoroughly explained, so I spent some months writing up a long explanation of all the algorithms used in the game. The entire package came to some 150 pages. We charged a lot of money for it, so it didn’t sell many copies. Still, I hoped that the buyers would use the ideas in the package. I was disappointed, because only one game appeared using any of the ideas we published in the source code: Ghost Ship, by Kellyn Beeck. Perhaps somebody else used some of the ideas without my knowing, but I rather doubt it.</description>

      <description>My goal was to write the smallest C compiler which is able to compile
itself. I choose a subset of C which was general enough to write a
small C compiler. Then I extended the C subset until I reached the
maximum size authorized by the contest: 2048 bytes of C source
excluding the &amp;#39;;&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;{&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;}&amp;#39; and space characters.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Large-Scale Image Recognition Without Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06171</link>
      <description>Batch normalization is a key component of most image classification models,
but it has many undesirable properties stemming from its dependence on the
batch size and interactions between examples. Although recent work has
succeeded in training deep ResNets without normalization layers, these models
do not match the test accuracies of the best batch-normalized networks, and are
often unstable for large learning rates or strong data augmentations. In this
work, we develop an adaptive gradient clipping technique which overcomes these
instabilities, and design a significantly improved class of Normalizer-Free
ResNets. Our smaller models match the test accuracy of an EfficientNet-B7 on
ImageNet while being up to 8.7x faster to train, and our largest models attain
a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 86.5%. In addition, Normalizer-Free
models attain significantly better performance than their batch-normalized
counterparts when finetuning on ImageNet after large-scale pre-training on a
dataset of 300 million labeled images, with our best models obtaining an
accuracy of 89.2%. Our code is available at https://github.com/deepmind/

      <description>A new phase II study from Moderna shows that half-doses (50 μg) appear to be as good as full doses (100 ug) at generating correlates of protection such as neutralizing antibodies. In this randomized, controlled phase 2 trial, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, administered as a two-dose vaccination regimen at 50 and 100 μg, exhibited […]</description>

      <title>Running custom availability tests using Azure Functions</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/running-custom-availability-tests-azure-functions/</link>
      <description>This article shows you how create and run custom availability tests using Azure Functions. This is an update to the blog post about monitoring WebJobs using Application Insights, since Microsoft is deprecating the Load Test and Performance features, this is the recommended alternative for monitoring availability. To get started you need to create an Azure function in C# with Timer Trigger. You can choose the trigger interval based on your requirement. This is one of the main advantage compared to Application Insights availability test feature. Next you need to add following packages.</description>
