      <title>The subtleties of Create&amp;#173;Stream&amp;#173;On&amp;#173;HGlobal, part 3: Suppressing the deletion of a shared HGLOBAL</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210930-00/?p=105745</link>
      <description>Last time, we looked at what happens if you suppress the deletion of a HGLOBAL that the stream created on your behalf. This time, we’ll look at what happens if you provide an explicit initial HGLOBAL. If you provide an explicit initial HGLOBAL and also pass fDelete&amp;#173;On&amp;#173;Release = FALSE,</description>

      <title>The value of in-house expertise</title>
      <link>https://danluu.com/in-house/</link>
      <description>An alternate title for this post might be, &amp;quot;Twitter has a kernel team!?&amp;quot;. At this point, I&amp;#39;ve heard that surprised exclamation enough that I&amp;#39;ve lost count of the number times that&amp;#39;s been said to me (I&amp;#39;d guess that it&amp;#39;s more than ten but less than a hundred). If we look at trendy companies that are within a couple factors of two in size of Twitter (in terms of either market cap or number of engineers), they mostly don&amp;#39;t have similar expertise, often as a result of path dependence — because they &amp;quot;grew up&amp;quot; in the cloud, they didn&amp;#39;t need kernel expertise to keep the lights on the way an on prem company does. While that makes it socially understandable that people who&amp;#39;ve spent their career at younger, trendier, companies, are surprised by Twitter having a kernel team, I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a technical reason for the surprise.</description>

      <title>Grouping Assertions in Tests</title>
      <link>https://ardalis.com/grouping-assertions-in-tests/</link>
      <description>Although it&amp;#39;s generally considered a best practice to assert only one thing per test, sometimes one logical &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; may require multiple assertion statements to be executed. In such cases, it&amp;#39;s helpful to be able to see all of the parts of the larger assertion that failed, so you don&amp;#39;t end up chasing after them one by one.</description>

      <title>Introduction — pyNomo Documentation 0.3.2.0 documentation</title>
      <link>http://lefakkomies.github.io/pynomo-doc/introduction/introduction.html</link>
      <description>A nomogram or nomograph is a diagram that provides an easy, graphical way of calculating the result of a mathematical formula. Sometimes also called an alignment chart, a nomogram consists of a set of numbered scales, usually one for each variable in the formula, arranged so that a straightedge can be placed across known values to find the unknown value that solves the formula. Since an equation in two variables is usually represented by a graph, most nomograms represent formulas that involve three or more variables.</description>
