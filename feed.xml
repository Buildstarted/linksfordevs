        The Five Most Likely Explanations for Long Delayed Echoes
       - Department of Physics</title>
      <link>https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/people/aca/sverre/articles/lde.html</link>
      <description>Radio waves travel so fast that most people consider them to reach their destination instantaneously. Perhaps the only exception is a TV newscast with a live interview to another continent. The connection via a geostationary satellite gives a delay of about half a second from the end of a question to the start of the response. Still, much longer delays have been experienced from the beginning of the radio era. Such echoes occur very seldom and are called long delayed echoes (LDE).

      <title>Making rust as fast as go</title>
      <link>https://www.christianfscott.com/making-rust-as-fast-as-go/</link>
      <description>Update: as some keen HN commenters have pointed out, it looks like the rust program is not actually equivalent to the go program. The go program parses the string once, while the rust program parses it repeatedly inside every loop. It’s quite late in Sydney as I write this so I’m not up for a fix right now, but this post is probably Fake News. The perf gains from jemalloc are real, but it’s likely not the allocators fault.</description>

      <title>So I reverse engineered two dating apps...</title>
      <link>https://push32.com/post/dating-app-fail/</link>
      <description>In this post I show some of my findings during the reverse engineering of the apps Coffee Meets Bagel and The League. I have identified several critical vulnerabilities during the research, all of which have been reported to the affected vendors.
Introduction In these unprecedented times, more and more people are escaping into the digital world to cope with social distancing. During these times cyber-security is more important than ever. From my limited experience, very few startups are mindful of security best practices.</description>
