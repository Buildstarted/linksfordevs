      <title>Being a Grafanista: a look from inside</title>
      <link>https://pracucci.com/being-a-grafanista-a-look-from-inside.html</link>
      <description>Saturday, 2pm. Kids are sleeping. Wife is sleeping. Had to stop preparing for the upcoming travel to make sure the rest of the family can rest in absolute silence. Looks the right time to take a break and sit down to write a piece. I have a short time and lot to say, so forgive me if the form is not perfect and let’s focus on content!</description>

      <title>Zen and Development | Potemkin Life</title>
      <link>https://potemkinlife.com/zen/</link>
      <description>Good software engineers are rare. There are many reasons as to why. The most obvious reason is that to become a good software developer one has to master many skills (language proficiency, documentation literacy, debugging, text editing, architecture, and design, etc, etc). Because these are the obvious barriers to becoming good, there is an abundance of advice out there for young engineers on how to hone their skills. Most of this advice is either uninteresting, inefficient, or both. Why? Because the process of mastering a skill is typically independent of the skill being mastered. The process is almost always as simple as: learn (read technical material), practice (daily), have patience.</description>

      <title>How to build mini high voltage Jacob's Ladder</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx9uPl2vGSI</link>
      <description>Today's build is really simple but really cool looking miniature high voltage Jacob's ladder. 
In this video we assemble "15KV high voltage generator kit", get some basic working principles about Jacob's ladder and maybe some more general tips and tricks.
Heart of the build is cheap 15KV high voltage generator kit, i bought it online for about 1.5.- USD.
Total budget on parts was around 2..3USD :)
You can run it on single 18650  battery but i chose dc jack (At the moment the prices of batteries are too high).

Working principle: (0:28)
