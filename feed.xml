      <title>Adding Antivirus to .NET Aspire Systems</title>
      <link>https://jeffreyfritz.com/2024/07/adding-antivirus-to-net-aspire-systems/</link>
      <description>I was working on a web application over the weekend and I needed to add a feature that would allow images to be uploaded by end-users.  As we all know, we should never trust content uploaded by anonymous ‘friends’ on the internet.  I wanted to add malware scanning to my project, but how?  In this article, I introduce a proof-of-concept project that adds the open source ClamAV antivirus scanner to a .NET Aspire system and shares connection information so that other resources can request malware scans.</description>

      <title>Setting Up Renovate as Azure DevOps Pipeline for Automatic .NET NuGet Package Updates</title>
      <link>https://nietras.com/2024/07/09/renovate-azure-devops/</link>
      <description>Renovate is a tool/bot that can automatically
update dependencies in a repository similar to GitHub
dependabot. Renovate is open
source and written in TypeScript. It
supports a wide range of platforms and package managers. Here I will show how to
set up Renovate as a single central Azure DevOps pipeline to automatically
update NuGet packages (and .NET SDK) in multiple git repositories across
different projects in Azure DevOps.

      <description>Recently, a colleague checked out Gleam’s language tour. They liked what they saw, but they were confused by Gleam’s use syntax. I like Gleam’s syntax a lotI even wrote an article about Gleam’s syntax., but I was also confused by use when I first encountered it. Here’s how I use use:The use expression was introduced in Gleam v0.25, as a more general replacement for the try keyword that preceded it.</description>

      <title>My Liner Notes for Spore</title>
      <link>https://www.chrishecker.com/My_Liner_Notes_for_Spore</link>
      <description>This page is intended to be a sort of liner notes for my contributions to Spore.  It&amp;#39;s a place for me to write up miscellaneous development comments about the parts of the game I worked on, while they&amp;#39;re still fresh in my mind.  I think the game had over 80 people working on it towards the end, and it was in development for more than 5 years, so basically everything in the game was touched by more than one person and was a team effort.  Given that, I will strive for inclusion and accuracy, and I will only talk about systems to which I made substantial contributions.  If I&amp;#39;ve left somebody out or made a mistake, I apologize; please email me and I&amp;#39;ll correct it immediately.</description>

      <title>Borderless Is Inevitable</title>
      <link>https://www.jerry.wtf/posts/borderless-is-inevitable/</link>
      <description>
The world is shrinking, and some people are upset. Today I read on article on Hacker News “What does a world without Airbnb look like?” which talks about the negative sentiment against long-term tourists in Barcelona, and it corroborated the discussion I saw on the Digital Nomad subreddit yesterday “Cancel Barcelona Trip?”.
Mobility
When I was a kid, my family moved from China to Canada. The ease of it all seemed normal to me. Make a life in a new country? No big deal. As I grew up, I realized this wasn’t far from the truth for most of the developed world. If you’re in a Western country and dead set on becoming a citizen of another, is it really that hard? Not really.
This is the world we created after World War II. We asked for peace and open borders. Now we’re surprised when people use them?</description>

      <title>Self Documenting Code Is Bullshit – Klaus Breyer</title>
      <link>https://www.v01.io/posts/2024-self-documenting-code-is-bullshit/</link>
      <description>Hopefully, every development team reaches a point where they discuss their guidelines and policies. Part of this discussion, hopefully, includes expectations around documentation.
So far, so good. Unfortunately, many teams (and I have made this mistake in the past as well) take the easy route and claim they don’t need extensive documentation if they write self-documenting code. Besides the fact that this is just an easy way to avoid a discussion (because everyone interprets this differently), it is just plain wrong.</description>

      <link>https://www.neelc.org/posts/school-phone-ban/</link>
      <description>Today I read that many schools from NYC to LA want to ban smartphones in school. Well, let me tell you that my high school, Somers High School of Somers, NY (an rural-ish but rich NYC exurb) did actually ban phones back in 2011, and when I graduated in 2015 they still did.
When it comes to mobile tech, the early-to-mid-2010s were almost like the stone age. Whereas most of my peers had an iPhone on Verizon, my family chose to go with Samsung phones on Sprint.</description>

      <title>Migrating enterprise apps stuck on legacy technologies</title>
      <link>https://agostonbarna.github.io/posts/migrating-enterprise-apps-stuck-on-legacy-technologies/</link>
      <description>Enterprise applications often have a hefty and complex code base, mission-critical functionality, and a constant influx of feature demands that can result in a slower pace of dependency updates and a tendency to lag behind. This situation can worsen over time, as certain high-profile dependencies become outdated or discontinued, preventing the update of interlocked dependencies and leading to a cascade of technological stagnation. Eventually, this can reach a critical point, requiring big bang migrations to break free from the constraints of problematic legacy technologies.</description>
