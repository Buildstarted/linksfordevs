      <description>Just over two years ago I left a role at a London based startup where I lead development of a large, React based e-commerce frontend to join Google to work on Chrome DevTools. My initial focus was to introduce Web Components as the new fundamental building block of all new DevTools features and UI. With the recently launched Recorder panel along with others, there are now large parts of DevTools that are almost exclusively web components.</description>

      <title>The Pareto PM - Jon Douglas</title>
      <link>https://jondouglas.dev/the-pareto-pm/</link>
      <description>As I reflect upon the last 5 years, one of the biggest themes that sticks out is whether a PM is thinking in outputs or outcomes.An early in career PM may be thinking purely in outputs. How many features can we build? How many bugs can we fix in this release? How many interviews should I do? And so on.Later in career PM tend to think in outcomes. What features will bring the most impact this year? What bugs will solve most of our user’s issues? What type of interviews will bring answers our teams need? This is what I can best define as a “Pareto PM”. For those unfamiliar, the pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule simply states that 80% of the outcomes come from 20% of the causes.</description>

      <link>https://muscaw.dev/2022/05/01/setup-mypy-for-fun-and-profit/</link>
      <description>Have you ever written Python code and had to dig deep into callstacks to understand what the return type of a function is?
I know I did and unfortunately, it makes me slower overall because I always have to dig through the callstack to understand what I’m dealing with. This also makes the code sensibly more complex given the number of additional checks that need to be implemented to assert a returned value is of an expected type.</description>

      <description>You cannot realise that, but your computer has a battery inside it only to get your computer clock running. Back in the 90s, when the rechargeable (lithium-ion) battery was not cheap, we used to disassemble our computers to replace their clock battery when the computer could not keep the clock “on time” anymore. Yeah, your computer clock is a “thing”.</description>

      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/559/whats-two-adicity/</link>
      <description>Some elliptic curves (related to zero-knowledge proofs I believe) have been claiming high 2-adicity. But for some reason, it seems a bit hard to find a definition of what this term means. And oddly, it&amp;#39;s not a complicated thing to explain. So here&amp;#39;s a short note about it.
You can see this being mentioned for example by the pasta curves:

They have the same 2-adicity, 32, unlike the Tweedle curves  ...</description>
