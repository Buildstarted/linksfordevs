      <title>10+ Sorts, Visualized - Disparity Cube  (Radix, Gravity, Quicksort, ...)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsSu0LQmhY8</link>
      <description>Visualization of 12 different Sorting Algorithms as a Cube with sound.

✅ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/CompilerStuck?sub_confirmation=1

Each dot, representing a part of the Cube has its own color. 
If it is swapped with another dot, its size changes according to how far it is away from its original position. Large Ball = Org. Pos. , Small Ball = Pos far away

Time Stamps:
00:00 Merge Sort
00:33 Gravity (Bead) Sort
00:45 Radix Sort (Base 10)
01:00 Cycle Sort
01:15 Heap Sort
01:40 Selection Sort
01:55 Quick Sort (Dual Pivot)
02:15 Shell Sort
02:37 Quick Sort (Pivot Middle)
02:50 Double Selection Sort
03:02 Comb Sort
03:51 Counting Sort
04:05 Comparison Table


Measurements explained: 
As "Comparison" counts the comparison of a value from the Array with any other value.
As "Segment" counts every sorted part of the array.
"Real Time" corresponds to the measured time only used for the algorithm.
As "Swap" counts the exchange between the indexes of two elements of the array.
As "Write to the Main Array" counts the change of a value in the Array.

Please put your wished and questions in the comments.  :)</description>

      <title>The stack monoid</title>
      <link>https://raphlinus.github.io/gpu/2020/09/05/stack-monoid.html</link>
      <description>This is a bit of a followup to Towards GPGPU JSON parsing. That proposed a rather roundabout way to parallelize a simple parsing task. Having had more GPU programming experience under my belt, I don’t expect that particular approach to work well, but it did suggest that parallelism exists in the problem.</description>

      <link>https://kevin.burke.dev/kevin/building-a-better-home-network/?hn=</link>
      <description>I finally got my home network in a place where I am happy with it. I wanted to
share my setup and what I learned about it. There has never been a better time
to set up a great home network; there are several new tools that have made this
easier and better than in the past. Hopefully this will help you set up your
home network!</description>

      <link>https://davidyat.es/2020/09/05/fraidycat/</link>
      <description>Long-time readers will know that I’m a big fan of RSS feeds. An RSS reader has been essential to my web experience since I first came online, and I’ve doggedly stuck to using them even as the web has centralised onto a few platforms and much digital ink spilt about the “death of RSS”. Luckily, I’m not the only one who prefers this old-school, human-curated approach to the web over today’s platforms and their algorithms.</description>

      <title>When to stop working on side-projects</title>
      <link>https://squadrick.dev/journal/when-to-stop-side-projects.html</link>
      <description>I’m a professional coder, and so like all good coders™, I spend a non-trivial number of hours working each week on side-projects. The projects’ range is pretty wide, from low-level RPC stuff to machine learning and rendering engines. Right now, I’m working on several projects that might never see the light-of-day. The most significant among them (and the only one that has been open-sourced) is Shadesmar.</description>
