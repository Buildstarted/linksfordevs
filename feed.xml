      <description>WhatsApp is my most used app, but its development seems stagnant. Which is not always a bad thing for software, but WhatsApp could really improve some things, especially when those improvements seem trivial. Some wishes could even be classified as bugs: which they should really fix. In no particular order (for iOS).

      <title>Remembering Buildtool - Julio Merino (jmmv.dev)</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/05/remembering-buildtool.html</link>
      <description>Build systems are one of my favorite topics in software engineering. If I recall correctly, my interest in this area started when I got into NetBSD in 2002&amp;amp;mdash;20 years ago&amp;amp;mdash;and became a pkgsrc contributor. Packaging software for NetBSD made me fight various build systems and, in particular, experience the pains of debugging the GNU Autotools.
Around that same time, I was also writing small tools here and there. Out of inertia, I used the GNU Autotools for these and, the more I used them, the more I saw an opportunity for improvement.</description>

      <title>Cats learn the names of their friend cats in their daily lives - Scientific Reports</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10261-5</link>
      <description>Humans communicate with each other through language, which enables us talk about things beyond time and space. Do non-human animals learn to associate human speech with specific objects in everyday life? We examined whether cats matched familiar cats’ names and faces (Exp.1) and human family members’ names and faces (Exp.2). Cats were presented with a photo of the familiar cat’s face on a laptop monitor after hearing the same cat’s name or another cat’s name called by the subject cat’s owner (Exp.1) or an experimenter (Exp.2). Half of the trials were in a congruent condition where the name and face matched, and half were in an incongruent (mismatch) condition. Results of Exp.1 showed that household cats paid attention to the monitor for longer in the incongruent condition, suggesting an expectancy violation effect; however, caf&amp;#233; cats did not. In Exp.2, cats living in larger human families were found to look at the monitor for increasingly longer durations in the incongruent condition. Furthermore, this tendency was stronger among cats that had lived with their human family for a longer time, although we could not rule out an effect of age. This study provides evidence that cats link a companion&amp;#39;s name and corresponding face without explicit training.</description>

      <title>Operator precedence by textual substitution</title>
      <link>https://www.kmjn.org/notes/operator_precedence_fortran.html</link>
      <description>Operator precedence is a traditional feature of mathematical notation where,
absent explicit parentheses, some operators bind tighter than others (&amp;quot;have
higher precedence&amp;quot;). For example, a + b &amp;#215; c would be interpreted as
a + (b &amp;#215; c), not as (a + b) &amp;#215; c, because multiplication has
higher precedence than addition.</description>
