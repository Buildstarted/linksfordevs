      <description>As a teenager, I always thought that the term “alpha male” sounded cool and powerful and worthy of pursuit. What it meant to me from how mainstream culture communicated it to me was to be dominating, strong, talking over people, and generally being on top.

      <description>The week began as busy as ever. And then I learned that one more task — beyond everything else on my plate — must be accomplished. Which task? The one you are reading. Why?

      <title>The Four Quadrants of Conformism</title>
      <link>http://paulgraham.com/conformism.html</link>
      <description>One of the most revealing ways to classify people is by the degree
and aggressiveness of their conformism. Imagine a Cartesian coordinate
system whose horizontal axis runs from conventional-minded on the
left to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axis
runs from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The
resulting four quadrants define four types of people. Starting in
the upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively
conventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively
independent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded.</description>

Worst paragraph ever written:
I Just built / made / coded that tennis game from Wii Sports using #Unity #gamedev #unity3d #gmtk gmtk in 24 hours / one day. Unity is pretty easy to use! I recommend you all try out unity game engine or unreal engine 4 or godot.
