      <title>When computers start cooking</title>
      <link>https://moritzwolf.com/when-computers-start-cooking</link>
      <description>A friend of mine and I created an AI that writes recipes. We trained a hugging-face transformer on our own scraped dataset of german recipes. And after some fiddling it create sensible output. And now I thought it would be fun translating the german recipes into English by another AI. You can find the source code on github. We even built a whole website for 100k+ german recipes generated by a computer. 1 and I want to soon add AI-generated jokes…&amp;#160;↩</description>

      <title>Failure Is Not An Option</title>
      <link>http://joeandmotorboat.com/2020/12/28/failure-is-not-an-option</link>
      <description>I ride my bike a lot. During most of 2020 much of that time has been solo riding. I got an Audible subscription and have been listening to books during my hours of solitude. Recently I listened to Failure is not an option by Gene Kranz. Overall an interesting insider’s perspective on flight control and the career of an flight director during the Gemini and Apollo missions. More than that it has lessons for any team dealing with complex systems in high pressure environments. Throughout the book I heard interesting anecdotes that rang true for me having been on numerous teams of folks running software and infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Google&amp;#39;s Got A Secret - Knuckleheads&amp;#39; Club</title>
      <link>https://knuckleheads.club/</link>
      <description>Search engines depend on a process called web crawling. Crawling the web is where you program a bunch of computers to go across the Internet and save copies of everything that they find there. These copies are then processed so that search engines can use those documents later on to answer users’ queries. So, if you can’t crawl the web, then you can’t run a search engine.</description>
