      <title>Databases = Frameworks for Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://laplab.me/posts/databases-are-frameworks-for-distributed-systems/</link>
      <description>This article was originally posted on dev.to, but it turns out that HackerNews banned this website, so I decided to create my own.
 Lego of the database world It is quite common for a distributed database to have the following components:
  Distributed Storage Usually, this component has an interface of a key-value store: Get(key) and Set(key, value), where key and value are some binary strings. This component knows nothing about the data - it can be rows from the table, JSON documents or something else entirely.</description>

      <title>Visual Debugging Now!</title>
      <link>https://nickarner.com/notes/visual-debugging-now-may-20-2022/</link>
      <description>Guest post from Anton Troynikov
Over the last seven or so years of working in robotics and computer vision, the bitter lesson I’ve learned is that the bug is almost always in the part of the algorithm you didn’t visualize.
This is a call to fix that problem once and for all.
The Problem Many domains, including robotics, foundationally rely on highly performant numerical software. But since humans are adapted to understand space visually, we don’t have good intuitions for numerical data.</description>

      <title>Monitor radiation with a Raspberry Pi</title>
      <link>https://nbailey.ca/post/radiation-monitor/</link>
      <description>I have an odd fascination with radiation… Not to the point that I’m buying “Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials” (or NORMs for short) on eBay, but certainly to the point that I own a digital geiger counter and regularly measure… things…
Recently, I discovered https://radmon.org, a site where users can connect a counter to their API and send data to the network of scientists that study background radiation in real time.</description>

      <title>Building my first mechanical keyboard</title>
      <link>https://not-matthias.github.io/posts/mechanical-keyboard/</link>
      <description>A friend of mine recently brought up his custom mechanical keyboard while we were hanging out in voice chat, and at first, nobody understood why anyone would buy one. At that time, I had no clue that there are entire communities about building custom keyboards. With every sentence that was said, we got deeper into this community. We explored different YouTube channels, watched comparisons, and listened to sound tests.</description>
