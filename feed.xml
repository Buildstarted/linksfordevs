      <description>We had originally planned to go all-in on passkeys for ONCE/Campfire, and we built the early authentication system entirely around that. It was not a simple setup! Handling passkeys properly is surprisingly complicated on the backend, but we got it done. Unfortunately, the user experience kinda sucked, so we ended up ripping it all out...</description>

      <title>Trust takes time</title>
      <link>https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2024/10/15/trust-takes-time/</link>
      <description>Today’s websites and apps are built to compensate for an absence of trust, rather than to support its growth. Customers and companies both understand that human handshakes no longer scale in the digital age, and surrender to their replacement by a tap of the finger on a button labeled I accept. While every handshake comes with an expectation of honesty, this button never did: we know we are lying the moment we touch it, as does the author of the legalese no one expects anyone to read. Navigating a trustless world is a heavy price to pay for the boundless freedoms of the World Wide Web—except it doesn’t have to be like this. Although trust remains an inherently human relationship, machines can help us build and evolve our relationships by handling the fiddly bits on our behalf. This liberates people to refocus on gaining mutual value from our relationships, without the huge burden of their setup and maintenance. Everything starts with the realization that data technology is fundamentally trust technology, and thus a transversal layer within any ecosystem rather than just the icing on the cake.</description>

      <description>Important Note: Although I work at Apple and am deeply involved in the creation of its new Passwords app, in this post I am speaking only for myself and not for Apple. There is no “news” in this post, or any kind of “inside scoop”. My intention is to help the kind of person who would read a blog post about password managers think about and manage their credential data better.</description>
