      <title>Being explicit about expectations isn&amp;#39;t micromanagement - Michael Bensoussan – Engineering &amp;amp; Leadership</title>
      <link>https://michaelbensoussan.com/posts/expectations-vs-micromanagement/</link>
      <description>Goals without explicit expectations are just wishes. I learned that being clear about what you need from senior engineers isn’t micromanagement — it’s good leadership. Because when everyone knows what good looks like, they can focus on delivering instead of mind-reading.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Models: Better Than You Think</title>
      <link>https://entropicthoughts.com/arithmetic-models-better-than-you-think</link>
      <description>LessWrong user dynomight explains how arithmetic is an underrated world-modeling
technology and uses dimensional algebra as the motivating case. I agree
dimensional algebra is fantastic, but there’s an even better motivating example
for arithmetic in world-modeling: linear models for prediction.</description>

      <title>The Efficiency of Vim | bencornia.com</title>
      <link>https://bencornia.com/blog/the-efficiency-of-vim</link>
      <description>I learned to touch type in fifth grade. We would shuffle into the computer lab and open up Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing1. I peaked at about 80 wpm. Today, I type somewhere between 60-70 wpm. If I am writing code then that drops to 40-50 wpm. It bothers me that I can&amp;#39;t crack 100 wpm but what I have come to realize is that text editing is less about typing speed and more about typing efficiency.</description>
