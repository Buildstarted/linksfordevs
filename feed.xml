      <description>You've possibly just found out you're in a data breach. The organisation involved may have contacted you and advised your password was exposed but fortunately, they encrypted it. But you should change it anyway. Huh? Isn't the whole point of encryption that it protects data when exposed to unintended parties?</description>

      <description>One day not so long ago, I was in a meeting listening to a team explain  
why their service had gone down and taken out a big chunk of a business.  
They were one of those things that has to exist and work in order for 
the actual "thing that makes money" to go.  Think of delivering pizzas, 
connecting dog walkers with dogs who need to be walked, that kind of 
thing.</description>
