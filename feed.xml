[7:56] Talking similarities and differences between .NET vs .NET Core. [9:25] Having seen so many different seasons of different types of apps, Paul gives his take on Windows desktop applications going forward. [12:40] What is it about desktop apps that make certain people love them far above browser apps? [17:43] Paul shares how he is strategizing how to teach developers through (and with) Pluralsight. [20:46] A word from Azure DevOps Podcast’s sponsor: Clear Measure. [21:18] Should we be cautious about always jumping on the next new thing that comes along? Why or why not? [23:20] The importance of asking the right questions and getting help in the process of planning. [24:26] An incredibly important question to ask: What is my budget for running this in Azure? [29:58] Paul shares his predictions on where he sees things headed 5 and 10 years from now. [33:08] Paul talks programming boot camps, education, and understanding how to ‘finish’ software. [37:28] What course does Pluralsight not have that Paul wishes he could produce if the audience or need was there? [39:35] Jeffrey thanks Paul for joining the show once again! &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:   (Sponsor)  — Available on Amazon!  — Click here to download the .NET DevOps for Azure ebook!   — Follow to stay informed about future events!

      <description>On occasion, I make a typo and get “JavaScript error: Semicolon expected” and I chuckle a little, because JavaScript was designed to make semicolons optional most of the time. When I made this observation, some of my friends were amused because I included the phrase “JavaScript was designed.”</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#39;s the situation: it&amp;#39;s 1984, and you&amp;#39;re assigned to write the spellchecker for a new MS-DOS word processor.  Some users, but not many, will have 640K of memory in their PCs.  You need to support systems with as little as 256K.  That&amp;#39;s a quarter megabyte to contain the word processor, the document being edited, and the memory needed by the operating system.  Oh, and the spellchecker.</description>

      <title>How to Start Contributing To Open-Source</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF9IUQlZ2Sk</link>
      <description>Open-source software has become a foundational piece of modern software engineering, existing as the platform for everything from personal projects to the most successful products. Open-source is often framed as a good way to garner both visibility and experience, but in that assertion there&amp;#39;s a lot of assumptions about how you&amp;#39;ll participate. In this talk, we&amp;#39;ll cover basics of contributing to open-source and discuss tooling, etiquette, and self-care with the goal of preparing you to start making meaningful contributions to an existing open-source project.
