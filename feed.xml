      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0024-stevecollins/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Steve Collins to chat all about dependency injection in .NET. We (well, Steve!) demystified terms such as dependency inversion and inversion of control containers, and then delved into the world of dependency injection in .NET, covering scopes, and much more…
  Steve’s bio Steve Collins is an independent software developer/architect with over 25 years of experience in the industry. He started developing in early ’80s on ZX Spectrum, self-taught BASIC and Z80 Assembler.</description>

      <title>Migrate to ASP.NET Core MVC from ASP.NET Framework MVC</title>
      <link>https://www.josephguadagno.net/2021/05/19/migrate-to-asp-net-core-mvc-from-asp-net-mvc-framework</link>
      <description>.NET has been around for a while and has had many versions. We started the .NET Framework, moved into .NET Core, and now just .NET, kind of sort of :smile:. Keeping your application up with the latest version of .NET can be challenging. There are budgets to consider, time to learn the differences, and time to “fit in the migration.” Migrating or “upgrading” an ASP.NET MVC from .NET Framework to ASP.NET Core can be easy at times. Other times it can be just hard. There are no silver bullets to the migration as each project and solution is different. I’m going to walk you through one of the ways you can have a successful migration from ASP.NET MVC to ASP.NET Core MVC. At the end of the post, I’ll show you some gotchas that I have run across migrating applications.</description>

      <description>I already covered unravelling the with statement, and async with is not much different. Much like with, the language reference for async with gives an example of the statement already destructured.
