      <title>Why I’m Not Going Back to Patagonia as a Photographer</title>
      <link>https://fstoppers.com/landscapes/why-im-not-going-back-patagonia-photographer-696926</link>
      <description>Patagonia has long been a dream destination for photographers—dramatic peaks, vast landscapes, and the raw beauty of nature. I had high hopes of capturing my own version of this rugged terrain, expecting to find inspiration in the remote landscapes and the challenge of shooting in unpredictable weather. After finally making the journey, I left feeling uninspired, frustrated, and disappointed. And honestly? I have no desire to go back. Here’s why. Too Many People, Too Few Moments When I imagined Patagonia, I pictured solitude—standing in awe at towering mountains all to myself. The reality?</description>

      <title>Zyme - an evolvable language</title>
      <link>https://zyme.dev/blog/1_image_classification_by_evolving_bytecode</link>
      <description>We investigate the potential of evolving the bytecode of a biologically-inspired virtual machine as a plausible strategy for machine learning.
            We simulate evolution with the Zyme language and strand-based virtual machine.
            Our test problem is classifying handwritten digits from a subset of the MNIST dataset.
            Beginning with an initial program with performance no better than random guessing, we achieve consistent accuracy improvements through random mutations over 50 generations.
            Although these results fall short of state-of-the-art methods like neural networks, they demonstrate that adaptive mutations are found consistently and suggest the potential for evolving Zyme bytecode to competitively tackle the full MNIST task.
            This result also suggests the value of alternative virtual machines architectures in genetic programming, particularly those optimized for evolvability.</description>

      <title>How can open social protocols fail us in 2025</title>
      <link>https://shazow.net/posts/open-social-2025/</link>
      <description>Let’s compare the possible failure modes of various open social protocols:

ActivityPub/Mastodon
ATProto/Bluesky
Farcaster/Warpcast

Some scenarios I’d like to consider:

Can my identity be taken away?
Can my audience be taken away?
Can my ability to extend it and build on the protocol be taken away?

Some specific failure modes I’m concerned about:

What happens when the most popular app or instance becomes malicious?
Is there something the maintainer can do that would prompt me to abandon the service/protocol altogether?

Let’s begin:</description>

      <title>MLMove</title>
      <link>https://davidbdurst.com/mlmove/</link>
      <description>In multiplayer, first-person shooter games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO),
                        coordinated movement is a critical component of high-level strategic play. However, the
                        complexity of team coordination and the variety of conditions present in popular game maps
                        make it impractical to author hand-crafted movement policies for every scenario. We show
                        that it is possible to take a data-driven approach to creating human-like movement
                        controllers for CS:GO. We curate a team movement dataset comprising 123 hours of
                        professional game play traces, and use this dataset to train a transformer-based movement
                        model that generates human-like team movement for all players in a "Retakes" round of the
                        game. Importantly, the movement prediction model is efficient. Performing inference for all
                        players takes less than 0.5 ms per game step (amortized cost) on a single CPU core, making
                        it plausible for use in commercial games today. Human evaluators assess that our model
                        behaves more like humans than both commercially-available bots and procedural movement
                        controllers scripted by experts (16% to 59% higher by TrueSkill rating of "human-like").
                        Using experiments involving in-game bot vs. bot self-play, we demonstrate that our model
                        performs simple forms of teamwork, makes fewer common movement mistakes, and yields movement
                        distributions, player lifetimes, and kill locations similar to those observed in
                        professional CS:GO match play.</description>

      <title>my model of language models – Tom Lee</title>
      <link>https://tomlee.wtf/2025/04/03/a-model-of-language-models/</link>
      <description>The wordcel versus shape rotator debate was a brief but amusing moment of online faux antagonism. There is a natural human tendency to collapse all experience into a unidimensional continuum (or, if you’re attempting to show an unusual amount of intellectual rigor, a four-quadrant chart), and this was a good one: a germ of an empirically observed neurological difference flowered into a blooming meadow of cliches. Masculine Nietzchean autists versus effeminate silvertongued jurists! Everyone could find a reflection of themselves and a satisfying new antagonism to complement it.  Jocks versus nerds! Except only for nerds.</description>

      <description>Which language is the best? Well some will immediately proclaim C! Python! Rust!, a very direct question which the answer should probably be it depends, the context in which you are using the language and what for. Well I am not here to proclaim what is the best language and if you are waiting for such statement fine, it’s brainf**k. Now with that out of the way we will go on a journey of the languages I have picked up and how I ended up using and enjoying Go along with some experiences and opinions.</description>

      <title>From Code to Cloud in 15 Minutes: Jason Taylor's Expert Insights And The Clean Architecture Template</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=Zdi4rM32t1I</link>
      <description>RJJ Software's Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software's Podcasting Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.

 Show Notes "So I've been focused on the code to cloud journey, I like to call it, for the template. And two years ago, my goal was to provide a solution that could take you from code to cloud in 45 minutes or less. So I wanted it to be "file new project" to deploy a solution on Azure—because that's where my main focus is—within 45 minutes."— Jason Taylor

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie "GaProgMan" Taylor.

 In this episode, Jason Taylor (no relation) joined us to talk about his journey from Classic ASP to .NET and Azure. He also discusses clean architecture’s maintainability, and his open-source Clean Architecture Solution template for ASP .NET Core, along with strategies for learning new frameworks and dealing with complexity.

 "Right now the template supports PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server. If you want to support MySQL, it's relatively easy to do because there's already a Bicep module or a Terraform module that you can go in and use it. So I went from 45 minutes to now I can get things up and running in like, I don't know, two minutes of effort and 15 minutes of waiting around while I make my coffee"— Jason Taylor

 Along the way, we talk about some of the complexities involved with creating a template which supports multiple different frontend technologies and .NET Aspire (which was news to me when we recorded), all the while maintaining the goal of being the simplest approach for enterprise development with Clean Architecture.

 Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.

      <title>The Slow Collapse of Critical Thinking in OSINT due to AI</title>
      <link>https://www.dutchosintguy.com/post/the-slow-collapse-of-critical-thinking-in-osint-due-to-ai</link>
      <description>OSINT used to be a thinking game. Now it’s becoming a trusting game and that should terrify you.I’ve seen it firsthand, analysts running solid investigations, then slowly shifting more and more of the thinking to GenAI tools. At first, it’s small. You use ChatGPT to summarise a document or translate a foreign post. Then it’s helping draft your reports. Then it’s generating leads. And eventually, you’re not thinking as critically as you used to. You’re verifying less, questioning less, relying mo</description>
