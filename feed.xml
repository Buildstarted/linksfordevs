      <description>Few things make me sadder than the now predictable moment at which a successful person creates a sellable mysticism out of their good luck and privilege.</description>

      <title>Rapid, widespread, and preferential increase of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant in Houston, TX, revealed by 8,857 genome sequences</title>
      <link>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.21253753v1</link>
      <description>Genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have become of great interest worldwide because they have the potential to detrimentally alter the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and disease in individual patients. We recently sequenced 20,453 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients with COVID-19 disease in metropolitan Houston (population 7 million), dating from March 2020 to early February 2021. We discovered that all major variants of concern or interest are circulating in the region. To follow up on this discovery, we analyzed 8,857 genome sequences from patients in eight Houston Methodist hospitals dispersed throughout the metroplex diagnosed from January 1, 2021 to March 7, 2021. This sample represents 94% of Houston Methodist cases and 4.8% of all reported cases in metropolitan Houston during this period. We discovered rapid, widespread, and preferential increase of the SARS-CoV-2 UK B.1.1.7 throughout the region. The estimated case doubling time in the Houston area is 6.9 days. None of the 648 UK B.1.1.7 samples identified had the E484K change in spike protein that can cause decreased recognition by antibodies.

### Competing Interest Statement

      <title>Comparing Svelte and React - Jack Franklin</title>
      <link>https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/comparing-svelte-and-react-javascript/</link>
      <description>Last year I created Pomodone, a small time tracking application based on the Pomodoro technique of working in 25 minute intervals. It&amp;#39;s a pretty basic app; it has a 25 minute timer (that runs in a Web Worker) and saves a history of your &amp;quot;poms&amp;quot; to a small Firebase database. I initially built it using React (well, Preact actually) but I then started to play around with Svelte, and decided rebuilding the app in Svelte might be a nice way to blog about the similarities and differences between the libraries.</description>

      <title>Understanding JSON Schema — Understanding JSON Schema 7.0 documentation</title>
      <link>https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/</link>
      <description>JSON Schema is a powerful tool for validating the structure of JSON
data.  However, learning to use it by reading its specification is
like learning to drive a car by looking at its blueprints.  You don’t
need to know how an electric motor fits together if all
you want to do is pick up the groceries.  This book, therefore, aims
to be the friendly driving instructor for JSON Schema.  It’s for those
that want to write it and understand it, but maybe aren’t interested
in building their own car—er, writing their own JSON Schema
validator—just yet.</description>
