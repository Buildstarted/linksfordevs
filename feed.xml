      <title>Going all-in with nullable reference types</title>
      <link>https://blog.codingmilitia.com/2020/11/28/going-all-in-with-nullable-reference-types/</link>
      <description>I know I’m late to the party, but just recently had the opportunity to start using nullable reference types more seriously, so thought of gathering the first steps taken to go all-in with it.</description>

      <title>Digital Tools I Wish Existed</title>
      <link>https://jon.bo/posts/digital-tools/</link>
      <description>My digital life in a nutshell: I discover relevant content I don’t have time to consume, I find time and become overwhelmed with my scattered backlog, I wish the content were in a different format, and then I’m unable to find something again once I’ve consumed it. Not retaining enough is a valid problem but we’ll tackle that one later.
There’s a lot of generalization in my summary but the core issue is an extraordinarily high level of friction in the process of finding, organizing, and sharing digital content.</description>

      <title>The updated GetGCMemoryInfo API in .NET 5.0 and how it can help you | .NET Blog</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-updated-getgcmemoryinfo-api-in-net-5-0-and-how-it-can-help-you/</link>
      <description>A bit of history In .NET 3.0 we introduced a GC.GetGCMemoryInfo API for library code to get memory load related things (this was used in ArrayPool for example) so it exposed things library folks wanted at the time. In 5.0 I got requests from folks to monitor more things about the GC.</description>

      <title>「Dflat」Structured Data Store for Mobile</title>
      <link>https://dflat.io/</link>
      <description>If you are familiar with Core Data or Realm, Dflat occupies the same space as these two in your application. Unlike these two, Dflat has a different set of features and makes very different trade-offs. These features and trade-offs are grounded from real-world experiences in writing some of the world largest apps. Dflat is also built from ground-up using Swift and hopefully, you will find it is natural to interact with in the Swift language.</description>

      <title>How to Think for Yourself</title>
      <link>http://paulgraham.com/think.html</link>
      <description>There are some kinds of work that you can&amp;#39;t do well without thinking
differently from your peers. To be a successful scientist, for
example, it&amp;#39;s not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be
both correct and novel. You can&amp;#39;t publish papers saying things other
people already know. You need to say things no one else has realized
yet.</description>

      <description>Building upon the preliminary notes on analyzing Disk and File I/O performance with ETW traces, I’ll go into some more of the columns in the data. The Priority column represents the I/O priority, where higher numbers are more urgent and lower numbers are less urgent.</description>
