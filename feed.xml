      <title>The Many Lives of Null Island | Stamen</title>
      <link>https://stamen.com/the-many-lives-of-null-island/</link>
      <description>Last year we rebuilt our well-loved Stamen basemaps from scratch, re-creating them on a totally new tech stack in partnership with Stadia Maps. This was a bittersweet and challenging process, trying to build new styles that matched the aesthetics of the old maps, while still giving us a fresh start to keep these maps running...</description>

      <title>The Job Hunt is Driving me Mad</title>
      <link>https://www.jacky.wtf/essays/2024/the-hunt-driving-me-mad/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been looking for work since the layoffs at Code for America last September. Even when I briefly secured a role at
Plural, I didn&amp;#39;t stop looking for work because of the climate I was alerted to after taking on the role[1]. I
had anxiety about my public points on the tech industry contributing to my inability to secure a role, my sparse GitHub
account[2], lack of collegiate or accredited backgrounds and so many other things. I occasionally snap out of this main
character effect because no one cares that much. Or do they?</description>

      <title>Management Time</title>
      <link>https://fzakaria.com/2024/07/24/management-time.html</link>
      <description>Note This is the third (part1 &amp;amp; part2) installment on my series of improving ELF symbol relocation processing. Consider reading them if this post interests you. &amp;#128214; I have written previously about improvements to the dynamic linking process, specifically processing relocations for entries with symbols. The key insight into the improvements, that have let the dynamic linking process scale to 1 million relocation entries and up to 22x speedup compared to the traditional methadology, is memoizing the relocation entries. This memoization is possible since the linking order of the loader is deterministic and in store-based systems such as NixOS the libraries to be loaded are fixed &amp;amp; static.</description>

      <title>Don’t use NixOS</title>
      <link>https://rasmuskirk.com/articles/2024-07-24_dont-use-nixos/</link>
      <description>You’re on vacation and you wish
                                    to get some food. You find a
                                    restaurant, Ubuntu — an unusual
                                    name, perhaps African — but it’s
                                    right next to your hotel. You enjoy
                                    the food and, feeling emboldened,
                                    you decide to try more places. You
                                    venture further out, trying
                                    different restaurants like Popos and
                                    Arch. Sure, each time the accent is
                                    a little heavier and harder to
                                    understand, but it’s manageable.</description>
