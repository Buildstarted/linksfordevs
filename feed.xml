      <title>The only computer science book worth reading twice?</title>
      <link>https://simondobson.org/2010/05/14/cs-book-worth-reading-twice/</link>

seminal work in the whole of computer science, and certainly the book
that’s most influenced my career and research&amp;#160;interests.</description>
