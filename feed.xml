      <title>Collaborative programming in remote-first environment</title>
      <link>https://vtorosyan.github.io/collaborative-programming/</link>
      <description>Grafana Labs is a remote-first company. We hire and work with people from all over the world. The team I am in is a 10 person team is distributed across 5 countries (you can read more about our team here. Sometimes we leverage benefits of synchronous communication and collaboration, however as an all-remote company, most of the work happens asynchronously. Recently we started experimenting with synchronous collaborative programming and I was putting together a guide for our team to use as a reference and I thought of turning it into a blog post.

      <description>From Jobs: “You know we’re constantly taking. We don’t make most of the food we eat, we don’t grow it, anyway. We wear clothes other people make, we speak a language other people developed, we use a mathematics other people evolved and spent their lives building. I mean we’re constantly taking things. It’s a wonderful ecstatic feeling to create something and put it into the pool of human experience and knowledge.”</description>
