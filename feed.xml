      <title>Answer engines</title>
      <link>https://seirdy.one/notes/2022/05/25/answer-engines.html</link>
      <description>Reply to Is DuckDuckGo, DuckDuckDone? by Kev Quirk  I read your article and share similar concerns. Using Microsoft Bing and Google Search’s commercial APIs generally requires accepting some harsh terms, including a ban on mixing SERPs from multiple sources (this is why Ixquick shut down and the company pivoted to the Google-exclusive Startpage search service). But the requirement to allow trackers in a companion web browser was new to me. Most of these agreements are confidential, so users don’t really get transparency. On rare occasions, certain engines have successfully negotiated exceptions to result-mixing, but we don’t know what other terms are involved in these agreements. I’ve catalogued some other engines in my post A look at search engines with their own indexes , and there are many alternatives that don’t have this conflict of interest. Most of these are not as good as Google/Bing when it comes to finding specific pieces of information, but many are far better when it comes to website discovery under a particular topic.</description>

      <title>Why are tools such as Docker and Kubernetes written in Go and not C#? : csharp</title>
      <link>https://teddit.mha.fi/r/csharp/comments/uxh2oa/why_are_tools_such_as_docker_and_kubernetes/</link>
      <description>A lot of new tools that devs use seem to be written in Go. But why not C#? I know that C# and .Net is more than capable. Is it a lack of that kind of culture? How can we foster a more open source culture because it still seems like a lot of devs have old prejudices towards C# and .Net. I think having more interesting and useful open source tools written in C# would go a long way to change perceptions.</description>

      <link>https://vertigo.ai/focus/</link>
      <description>Vertigo.ai Focus is a new from-the-ground-up patent pending AI &amp;amp; GPU video CODEC that enables hi-def face to face interactions over low-bandwidth links. It is production-ready, extremely light-weight, and able to run in real-time on devices as old as the iPhone 6s. Focus builds on the Vertigo Engine, which demonstrates the power and versatility of our platform.
The core video CODEC works in combination with multiple neural networks that perform head and face tracking and real-time face recognition, to either filter away unrelated bystanders, or to allow everyone in view of the camera to be present in the call on equal footing.</description>
