      <title>How does the key exchange in HTTPS work?</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/f90d8190-7fd9-452a-b16f-7c2c973b07aa</link>
      <description>In this small blog post we will have a look at how HTTPS works. Well, we will look how the cryptographic part works a bit more in detail.
The focus is on the Diffie Hellman Key algorithm, an asymmetric key exchange.

      <title>Smaller debug info with constructor type homing</title>
      <link>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2021-04-05-constructor-homing-for-debug-info/</link>
      <description>Constructor type homing for debug info Background Class type information is a large contributor to debug info size. Clang already has a few optimizations to reduce the size of class type information based on the assumption that debug info can be spread out over multiple compilation units.</description>

      <title>Rendering Doom With Emojis - CrociDBlog</title>
      <link>https://crocidb.com/post/rendering-doom-with-emojis/</link>
      <description>It seems that creating a doom port, or hacking doom in general, is a common place for programmers. If you search for “doom port” on github, it’s inspiring how diverse projects you can find. The fact that the source code for the game is completely open and self-contained (meaning it doesn’t require dependencies) contributes a lot for this.</description>

      <title>Overzealous Destructuring | Aleksandr Hovhannisyan</title>
      <link>https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/overzealous-destructuring/</link>
      <description>Destructuring in JavaScript has many clever uses that can make your code more expressive and compact. But overusing it can make your code harder to read, trickier to debug, and more error prone.</description>

      <description>Epistemic Status: Overly Opinionated   There will always be a &amp;quot;gap&amp;quot; between morality and law. Sometimes the gap is &amp;quot;loose&amp;quot;, in which case people have more freedom. (This doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily have to be a good thing, e.g. sectors lacking regulation.) Sometimes the gap is too &amp;quot;</description>

      <title>Red Meat Friday: Is The FSF Fighting The Previous War?</title>
      <link>https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10864</link>
      <description>This is a bit genuine red meat and perhaps a little sensitive for some people but it does raise a point that deserves discussion. A shorthand for that point is the title of today’s post. A more descriptive way of describing it is, “Is the FSF’s demand for purity actually harming the users they’re striving to protect?”</description>

      <title>Setting up my new computer, vim, and listening to Spotify in the terminal</title>
      <link>https://johnwhiles.com/posts/the-new-dots</link>
      <description>I recently got a new laptop, and I decided that this would finally be the time that I don&amp;#39;t set it up in a completely ad hoc way.
Previously I would install every program I needed as I needed it, with no real plan of how I would replicate the setup if I needed to move to a different machine, or wipe the current one.
Tellingly, the one thing that I did make an effort to protect was my Vim config, which I&amp;#39;ve been maintaining for five years at this point (I have been a software developer for 5 years).
I want more things to be like Vim, so, I should decided to setup my computer with Ansible.</description>
