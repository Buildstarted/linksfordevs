      <title>5 Reasons Why You As a Developer Should Venture Into Machine Learning Today</title>
      <link>https://www.alexanderslotte.com/5-reasons-why-you-as-a-net-developer-should-venture-into-machine-learning-today/</link>
      <description>I’m fortunate enough to occasionally be invited to speak at conferences around the world about what I’m truly passionate about. Having the opportunity to teach machine learning to groups of highly skilled .NET developers is a privilege and one of the most rewarding things I get to do. I often get questions from developers why they should invest time into learning a completely new domain, and why companies shouldn’t just hire “real” Data Scientists. I wanted to take a moment to write down why I think developers in the .NET community should take an interest, a leap of faith if you will, and venture in the world of machine learning.  </description>

      <description>The problem with circular dependencies When building an application, good design dictates that you should avoid circular dependencies between your services. A circular dependency is when some components depend on each other, directly or indirectly, e.g. A depends on B which depends on C which depends on A: It is generally agreed that this should … Continue reading Lazily resolving services to fix circular dependencies in .NET Core →</description>
