      <title>You should delete tests</title>
      <link>https://andre.arko.net/2025/06/30/you-should-delete-tests/</link>
      <description>We’ve had decades of thought leadership around testing, especially coming from wholistic development philosophies like Agile, TDD, and BDD. After all that time and several supposedly superseding movements, the developers I talk to seem to have developed a folk wisdom around tests.
That consensus seems to boil down to simple but mostly helpful axioms, like “include tests for your changes” and “write a new test when you fix a bug to prevent regressions”. Unfortunately, one of those consensus beliefs seems to be “it is blasphemy to delete a test”, and that belief is not just wrong but actively harmful.</description>

      <title>The loneliness of infinite conversation</title>
      <link>https://karanchawla.io/2025/05/16/infiniteconvo</link>
      <description>Last week, I found myself in a two hour conversation with Claude about the nature of consciousness. We explored thought experiments, discussed edge cases, and built elaborate conceptual frameworks together. It was one of the most intellectually stimulating conversations I’d had in months.</description>

      <title>Principles I keep in mind when starting a side project</title>

      <description>The more aligned your expectations are with a project, the easier it is to actually finish it. Whether it's by keeping the scope tiny or avoiding unnecessary expenses, having a good set of principles to guide your side project is just as important as having a map when you're exploring unknown territory.</description>

      <title>Re: The Cult of Hard Mode</title>
      <link>https://takeonrules.com/2025/06/14/re-the-cult-of-hard-mode/</link>
      <description>Earlier this week I read Joan’s The Cult of Hard Mode: Why Simplicity Offends Tech Elites, something I had skipped over until I read Jack’s Hard Mode and status (and follow-up Hard Mode and blogging).
Jack writes quick thoughts, fluttering between changing out entire tool sets for his various workflows. Joan writes extended thoughts, creating a pathway that explores the thought and relations.
I love both of their blogs: one an excited friend sharing their moments another a more quiet person, but one that when they speak, I know I should give a listen. Crucial to both is that I receive their thoughts on my terms.

      <title>Exploiting the IKKO Activebuds "AI powered" earbuds, running DOOM, stealing their OpenAI API key and customer data.</title>
      <link>https://blog.mgdproductions.com/ikko-activebuds/</link>
      <description>So my journey with these earbuds started after I saw them on this Mrwhosetheboss video about pointless tech. This device seems to be also popular on TikTok. My suspicions were confirmed, this runs android. So of course i went ahead and bought them.

245 euros later... and they finally arrived!</description>

      <title>Guest Post: How I Scanned all of GitHub’s “Oops Commits” for Leaked Secrets ◆ Truffle Security Co.</title>
      <link>https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/guest-post-how-i-scanned-all-of-github-s-oops-commits-for-leaked-secrets</link>
      <description>GitHub Archive logs every public commit, even the ones developers try to delete. Force pushes often cover up mistakes like leaked credentials by rewriting Git history. GitHub keeps these dangling commits, from what we can tell, forever. In the archive, they show up as “zero-commit” PushEvents.</description>
