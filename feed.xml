      <title>Who goes through Y Combinator twice?</title>
      <link>https://www.jordanroga.com/blog/who-goes-through-y-combinator-twice</link>
      <description>Y Combinator has long been considered the gold standard of early-stage startup accelerators. But while most founders view it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, a rare group sees it differently — as a repeatable launchpad. These are the founders who’ve gone through YC not once, but twice (and occasionally, more). In this post, we’ll dive into the patterns and profiles of these YC returnees: What kinds of people get accepted multiple times?</description>

      <title>No, Software Moats Are Not Dead</title>
      <link>https://bloeys.com/blog/no-software-moats-are-not-dead/</link>
      <description>Note: This is not a random rant against AI, after all I am a Founder of an AI startup, Overlord Systems.
Much has been written recently about how software no longer has a moat because AI gives you both engineering ability and a high speed of producing software, therefore making any piece of software copyable in a short time, and thus software is no longer a moat. Only, this is isn’t true in the way it’s being advertised.</description>

      <title>Why Drinking Coffee in Iran Has Become So Ridiculously Complicated</title>
      <link>https://adelbordbari.github.io/etc/2025-04-16-coffee/</link>
      <description>It all started with a sarcastic jab in a chat:
“You shouldn’t be more Catholic than the Pope. You go to order a coffee, and the guy’s like, ‘From Kenyan farms or Brazil?’ It’s like going to Italy for ghormeh sabzi, and they ask if you want the herbs from Bostanabad or Tuyserkan. Come on—just give us an espresso so we can move on with our lives :))”</description>

      <title>DIY Streaming Video 101</title>
      <link>https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/03/18/video-encoding-101/</link>
      <description>So, you want to stream video on the web without dealing with Youtube or other video providers? Where do you even start?
Welcome to DIY Streaming Video 101.
I’m slowly working on building the infrastructure here for encoding and serving videos myself, and I’m trying to share what I’ve learned. I’m doing everything on Linux, mostly using FFMPEG for video conversion and serving the video myself, from a web server in my house.
Obviously, there are many services that you can pay to do this all for you, and most of them will do a better job at it most of the time, for a fee. But they may not be that much better, depending on your needs, and video streaming really isn’t that hard anymore.
All you need is a bit of time and a website.</description>

      <title>Toying Around</title>
      <link>https://toyi.ng/blog/llm-geocoding</link>
      <description>I was playing around with Google's Geocoding API when I thought to plug in my address into o1 for
        fun and
        curiosity's sake. Imagine my surprise when it actually got the coordinates right down to the first 3 decimal
        places
        (precision of within hundreds of meters)! Considering the fact that it got in the near vicinity without any
        internet access at all, that's pretty impressive. Naturally, the next step was to host a battle royale with a
        bunch of other widely-used LLMs to see which one is best for this "offline" geocoding (yes, I'm considering
        closed-weights LLMs in this, just imagine you're in the book Project Hail Mary, and you have access
        to
        every computer program ever).</description>

I boosted several posts about this already, but since people keep asking if I've seen it....

MITRE has announced that its funding for the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program and related programs, including the Common Weakness Enumeration Program, will expire on April 16. The CVE database is critical for anyone doing vulnerability management or security research, and for a whole lot of other uses. There isn't really anyone else left who does this, and it's typically been work that is paid for and supported by the US government, which is a major consumer of this information, btw.

I reached out to MITRE, and they confirmed it is for real. Here is the contract, which is through the Department of Homeland Security, and has been renewed annually on the 16th or 17th of April.

https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70RCSJ23FR0000015_7001_70RSAT20D00000001_7001

MITRE's CVE database is likely going offline tomorrow. They have told me that for now, historical CVE records will be available at GitHub, https://github.com/CVEProject

Yosry Barsoum, vice president and director at MITRE's Center for Securing the Homeland, said:

“On Wednesday, April 16, 2025, funding for MITRE to develop, operate, and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®) Program and related programs, such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™) Program, will expire.  The government continues to make considerable efforts to support MITRE’s role in the program and MITRE remains committed to CVE as a global resource.”</description>

      <description>MITRE’s 25-year-old Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program will end April 16 after DHS did not renew its funding contract for reasons unspecified. Experts say ending the program, which served as the crux for most cybersecurity defense programs, is a tragedy.</description>
