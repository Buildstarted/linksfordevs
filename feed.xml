      <title>Playing devil&amp;#39;s advocate on claims made in VPN adverts</title>
      <link>https://jameswillia.ms/posts/vpn-devils-advocate.html</link>
      <description>As a Gen-Z-er (just about), I spend too much time watching YouTube videos. This means I’m exposed to many adverts and video sponsorships from VPN companies (NordVPN in particular).
In many of these adverts, the supposed privacy and security benefits of using some VPN provider or another are proclaimed. (In fairness to VPN companies, they do seem to be shifting focus away from these kinds of claims in their advertising, but I still see it plenty).</description>

      <title>Accepting Mediocrity</title>
      <link>https://ahalbert.com/blog/2023/04/22/mediocrity.html</link>
      <description>These days, I feel more and more a sinking feeling that I haven’t accomplished anything important. I’m not sure what exactly it is I want – I say I should feel like my life is meaningful, but what exactly does that mean? While “meaningfulness” sounds like a noble goal, it could consist of less noble goals like winning the esteem of others, or being recognized as one of the “best” at something. Would I be ok if I was the best at something that everyone else thought was trivial? I want to do good in the world as well as do something meaningful, and I think those go hand in hand. But one thing is certain - there does feel like there’s a void in my life.</description>

      <title>What is your alternative to Agile?</title>
      <link>https://www.ebiester.com/agile/2023/04/22/what-agile-alternative.html</link>
      <description>This article, like many things, started as a comment made on Hacker News: As the parent said: I guess the “No True Agile” crowd is as alive and well as they were 10 years ago. When it’s a failure, they always come out of the woodwork to let you know you weren’t doing it according to the orthodoxy. When you point out that it isn’t faster in practice, they gaslight you and claim that was never the point in the first place. In a way it reminds me of a cult. You do a series arcane rituals that have no scientific evidence behind them, none of the process is data-driven or statistically proven. Frankly, it can’t die soon enough but as we all know some new hype will simply take its place to give busybody managers a reason to exist.</description>

      <title>Novel Tasks</title>
      <link>https://pid.vc/thoughts/2023/04/21/novel-tasks.html</link>
      <description>There’s only one thing to know about the capabilities of GPT-4 and other large language models: they cannot produce new ideas. To quote the Sparks of AGI paper from Microsoft, “Perhaps the only real test of understanding is whether one can produce new knowledge, such as proving new mathematical theorems, a feat that currently remains out of reach for LLMs.”</description>

      <title>What Follows from Empirical Software Research?</title>
      <link>https://jimmyhmiller.github.io/empirical</link>
      <description>There is a growing body of literature studying software engineering from the empirical perspective. There is perhaps no greater resource for discovering this content than It Will Never Work in Theory. Here you will find short reviews of countless empirical studies about software engineering. Some reviewed quite favorably, and others questioned quite vigorously.</description>
