      <title>Washington Post's Privacy Tip: Stop Using Chrome, Delete Meta's Apps (and Yandex) - Slashdot</title>
      <link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/06/07/035249/washington-posts-privacy-tip-stop-using-chrome-delete-metas-apps-and-yandex</link>
      <description>Meta's Facebook and Instagram apps "were siphoning people's data through a digital back door for months," writes a Washington Post tech columnist, citing researchers who found no privacy setting could've stopped what Meta and Yandex were doing, since those two companies "circumvented privacy and sec...</description>

      <title>The librarian immediately attempts to sell you a vuvuzela</title>
      <link>https://kaveland.no/posts/2025-06-06-library</link>
      <description>Imagine entering the biggest library in the world. You peer down an incredibly long aisle with wooden bookshelves brimming with books. You can see multiple such corridors, all lit with a comfortable warm light. There’s a rich smell of old paper. You can hear some muted voices, perhaps arguing in a whisper. It’s perfect, but vast and difficult to make sense of. Just this day, it doesn’t feel like such a terrible ordeal to just wander for a while, see where your legs take you. Maybe you’ll find something interesting completely by accident? The prospect is both exhilarating and daunting. The library appears endless, it feels like you could potentially find all sorts of exotic and interesting book collections.</description>

      <title>Will our next generation lose their own writing voice because of LLMs? | Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://andreagao.com/posts/next-generation-writing-voice/</link>
      <description>I loved writing a lot as a teenager and college student, since it was the easiest and most natural way to express myself and connect with others. Even now, years later, I can read my old writing and feel connected with my past self and derive something new from it.
I’ve been writing less in the last ten years because I’ve been busy with adulthood and juggling between English and Chinese. I used to write in Chinese, and now mostly write and communicate in English. However, I hadn’t given much thought to my own “writing voice” in either language till recently.</description>

      <title>Exploring the new Bluesky verification system</title>
      <link>https://anderegg.ca/2025/05/26/exploring-the-new-bluesky-verification-system</link>
      <description>On April 21st, the Bluesky team announced a new account verification system. In my opinion, one of the best bits about Bluesky was the ability to verify yourself using a domain name. This new system goes a step further, and I was curious about how it worked. This lead to me building a quick-and-dirty verifier listing tool.</description>

      <title>A year of funded FreeBSD</title>
      <link>https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2025-06-06-A-year-of-funded-FreeBSD.html</link>
      <description>I've been maintaining
FreeBSD on the
Amazon EC2 platform ever since I
first got it booting in 2010, but in
November
2023 I added to my responsibilities the role of FreeBSD release
engineering lead — just in time to announce the availability of
FreeBSD 14.0, although Glen Barber did all the release engineering work for
that release.  While I receive a small amount of funding from
Antithesis and from my
FreeBSD/EC2 Patreon, it
rapidly became clear that my release engineering duties were competing
with — in fact, out-competing — FreeBSD/EC2 for my available
FreeBSD volunteer hours: In addition to my long list of "features to
implement" stagnating, I had increasingly been saying "huh that's weird...
oh well, no time to investigate that now".  In short, by early 2024 I was
becoming increasingly concerned that I was not in a position to be a good
"owner" of the FreeBSD/EC2 platform.</description>
