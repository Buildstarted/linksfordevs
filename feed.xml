      <title>10 Reasons Startups Prefer Node.js over .NET</title>
      <link>https://michaelscodingspot.com/node-js-or-dotnet/</link>
      <description>I’ve been a .NET software developer for my entire career, and I truly love the platform. I love the C# language, the productivity of the platform, and the ecosystem. But I’ve been dealing with an existential crisis for years now. I see how companies, especially startups, don’t seem to choose .NET as their platform of choice. They go to Node.js, Ruby, Python, or even Java as an alternative to ASP.NET. I even went as far as to write an article about it: Where did the Microsoft Tech Stack disappear?</description>

      <title>Software Engineering Tips for CLMS Students</title>
      <link>https://catball.dev/clms_swe_tips/</link>
      <description>0. Preamble This webpage is adapted from a slide deck I made for an orientation peer-mentoring session for the 2022 UW Computational Linguistics program. These are tips I’ve found helpful for my own workflow and productivity. Bear in mind though, everyone works different! Likewise, different work environments may impose different requirements and challenges.
Some of what you see here may seem obvious, and some of these tips are very well-known. I hope at least one of these tips will help you, but take everything with a grain of salt.</description>
