      <title>The 2021/2022 Seattle Symphony subscription season at a glance | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210323-01/?p=104989</link>
      <description>For many years, I’ve put together a little pocket guide to the Seattle Symphony subscription season for my symphony friends to help them decide which ticket package they want. At some point, we may start subscribing again, but for now, we pick-and-choose individual concerts.</description>

      <title>Creating a task completion source for a C++ coroutine: Producing a result | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210323-00/?p=104987</link>
      <description>We’ve been looking at creating different types of awaitable synchronization objects. This time, we’ll create something analogous to what C# calls a Task&amp;#173;Completion&amp;#173;Source and what PPL calls a task_completion_event. For lack of a better name, I’m going to call it a result_holder.</description>

      <title>suite - Privacy-Enhancing Cryptography | CSRC | CSRC</title>
      <link>https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/pec/suite</link>
      <description>We would like to obtain public feedback on the document &amp;#39;Toward a PEC use-case suite (Draft)&amp;#39;  Abstract: This document motivates the development of a privacy-enhancing cryptography (PEC) use-case suite. This would constitute a set of proofs of concepts, showcasing the use of cryptographic tools for enabling privacy in various applications. This is not a proposal, but rather a sketch idea to motivate initial public feedback, which can be useful to determine a potential process towards a PEC use-case suite.  Keywords: cryptography, privacy; privacy-enhancing cryptography (PEC); reference material; secure multiparty computation (SMPC); zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)  Call for feedback  Privacy-enhancing cryptography (PEC) refers to cryptography used to enhance privacy, beyond the traditional sense of data confidentiality. For example, it enables sophisticated interactions that obtain a useful output of the combined information of multiple entities, although without them sharing their inputs with one another....</description>

      <title>Red seaweed (Asparagopsis taxiformis) supplementation reduces enteric methane by over 80 percent in beef steers</title>
      <link>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0247820</link>
      <description>The red macroalgae (seaweed) Asparagopsis spp. has shown to reduce ruminant enteric methane (CH4) production up to 99% in vitro. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Asparagopsis taxiformis on CH4 production (g/day per animal), yield (g CH4/kg dry matter intake (DMI)), and intensity (g CH4/kg ADG); average daily gain (ADG; kg gain/day), feed conversion efficiency (FCE; kg ADG/kg DMI), and carcass and meat quality in growing beef steers. Twenty-one Angus-Hereford beef steers were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: 0% (Control), 0.25% (Low), and 0.5% (High) A. taxiformis inclusion based on organic matter intake. Steers were fed 3 diets: high, medium, and low forage total mixed ration (TMR) representing life-stage diets of growing beef steers. The Low and High treatments over 147 days reduced enteric CH4 yield 45 and 68%, respectively. However, there was an interaction between TMR type and the magnitude of CH4 yield reduction. Supplementing low forage TMR reduced CH4 yield 69.8% (P &amp;lt;0.01) for Low and 80% (P &amp;lt;0.01) for High treatments. Hydrogen (H2) yield (g H2/DMI) increased (P &amp;lt;0.01) 336 and 590% compared to Control for the Low and High treatments, respectively. Carbon dioxide (CO2) yield (g CO2/DMI) increased 13.7% between Control and High treatments (P = 0.03). No differences were found in ADG, carcass quality, strip loin proximate analysis and shear force, or consumer taste preferences. DMI tended to decrease 8% (P = 0.08) in the Low treatment and DMI decreased 14% (P &amp;lt;0.01) in the High treatment. Conversely, FCE tended to increase 7% in Low (P = 0.06) and increased 14% in High (P &amp;lt;0.01) treatment compared to Control. The persistent reduction of CH4 by A. taxiformis supplementation suggests that this is a viable feed additive to significantly decrease the carbon footprint of ruminant livestock and potentially increase production efficiency.</description>

      <title>Why Writing Software Is Hard - darcism.com</title>
      <link>http://darcism.com/why-writing-software-is-hard/</link>
      <description>From time to time, I wonder why correctly functioning software is so difficult to write. Software development is something we’ve been doing a long time, that also has a benefit that many other crafts don’t: you can create a repeatable process that does exactly the same thing each time. Given this huge advantage, shouldn’t this […]</description>

      <title>How much do I pay to host a private blog</title>

      <description>If you are interested in how much it will cost you to host your own private
blog, here I will give you a breakdown of my expenses accompanying by tools and
services I pay for to host the Amortizedcost.net site.

The site is hosted on DigitalOcean and with current traffic I have price is
stable at the level of 6$ per month.

The domain name I bought at Iwantmyname.com for 17$ annually.

Since the blog engine is self-hosted I am not paying for it but in return, I
need to manage all updates manuall</description>

      <title>Your Anti-bot is Not Accessible</title>
      <link>https://artemis.sh/2021/03/21/your-antibot-is-not-accessible.html</link>
      <description>TL;DR: Input sequencing and automation tools such as autohotkey scripts, hardware macros, auto-clickers, and turbo buttons are important accessibility tools that allow people with disabilities to play games they’d otherwise be unable to play. These tools are often banned in multiplayer titles, particularly MMORPGs, in the name of fairness and bot prevention. I argue that these tools should be allowed, or even implemented within the game itself. With the recognition that a line has to be drawn somewhere, I suggest that a tool should be classified as a bot only if it automatically makes meaningful decisions in response to stimuli provided directly by the game, creating a feedback loop that does not involve the player. Further, I suggest that in the games that can’t allow external tools fairly, first-party accessibility features can still make the game playable for more people.</description>

      <title>Crystal 1.0 - What to expect</title>
      <link>https://crystal-lang.org/2021/03/22/crystal-1.0-what-to-expect.html</link>
      <description>The release of the first major release of Crystal arrives after many years of hard work. With thousands of contributions from people worldwide, it was finally possible to find consensus for what truly mattered for 1.0 and what could wait for future releases. Getting here wasn’t an easy journey, filled with enriching, controversial, delightful, and endless conversations that, in the end, made it possible to build a language more useful for more users.</description>
