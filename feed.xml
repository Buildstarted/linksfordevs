      <title>AI Hype - Am I out of work in five years?</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/5194faba-28db-4949-9d33-d7c1000b1156</link>
      <description>AI is a hot topic - one would say hype topic, and there are bold claims like this:
There Will Be No (Human) Programmers in Five Years
Source: https://decrypt.co/147191/no-human-programmers-five-years-ai-stability-ceo
Now how far is this from reality? Let&amp;#39;s take a look at the current state of AI in the context of programming.

      <description>Considering how many fools can calculate, it is
surprising that it should be thought either a difficult
or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to
master the same tricks.</description>

      <title>Stop Debugging and Start Running in Visual Studio</title>
      <link>https://ardalis.com/stop-debugging-start-running-visual-studio/</link>
      <description>The default way to start or run your application in Visual Studio has always been F5 or the solid green &amp;#39;play&amp;#39; button. But this attaches a debugger, which is only needed if you&amp;#39;re adding breakpoints and stepping through your code. It also can add significant time to the process of running your app. If you&amp;#39;re not constantly using the debugger, consider making Ctrl+F5 your default way to launch your apps.</description>

  “There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace - those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote
  bush or the pattern of its leaves. 

  We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society,
  seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort.
  Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of
  ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate
  pattern contains it own fixity. In such
  perfection, all things move toward death.”
  ~ Dune (1965)


I find the concept of embeddings to be one of the most fascinating ideas in machine learning. If you’ve ever used Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Google Translate, or even smartphone keyboard with next-word prediction, then chances are you’ve benefitted from this idea that has become central to Natural Language Processing models. There has been quite a development over the last couple of decades in using embeddings for neural models (Recent developments include contextualized word embeddings leading to cutting-edge models like BERT and GPT2).



Word2vec is a method to efficiently create word embeddings and has been around since 2013. But in addition to its utility as a word-embedding method, some of its concepts have been shown to be effective in creating recommendation engines and making sense of sequential data even in commercial, non-language tasks. Companies like Airbnb, Alibaba, Spotify, and Anghami have all benefitted from carving out this brilliant piece of machinery from the world of NLP and using it in production to empower a new breed of recommendation engines.

In this post, we’ll go over the concept of embedding, and the mechanics of generating embeddings with word2vec. But let’s start with an example to get familiar with using vectors to represent things. Did you know that a list of five numbers (a vector) can represent so much about your personality?

      <description>My founder friends constantly think about growth. They think about how to measure their business growth and how to get to the next order of magnitude scale. If they’re making $1M ARR today, they think about how to get to $10M ARR. If they have 1,000 users today, they think about how to get to 10,000 users.</description>
