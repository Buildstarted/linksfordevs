      <title>Improved DynamoDB Initialization Patterns for the AWS SDK for .NET | Amazon Web Services</title>
      <link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/improved-dynamodb-initialization-patterns-for-the-aws-sdk-for-net/</link>
      <description>The&amp;#160;AWS SDK for .NET includes the&amp;#160;Document and Object Persistence programming models, which provide an idiomatic .NET experience for working with&amp;#160;Amazon DynamoDB. Beginning in&amp;#160;AWSSDK.DynamoDBv2 3.7.203, there are new ways to initialize the document and object persistence models which can improve your application’s performance by reducing thread contention and throttling issues during the first call to DynamoDB.

      <title>Premature Infrastructure is the Root of All Evil</title>
      <link>https://michaelscodingspot.com/premature-infrastructure-is-evil/</link>
      <description>Premature infrastructure is a peculiar behavior pattern that I witnessed in every single tech company I worked for. It is the habit of creating infrastructure code before it is actually needed. The development team is predicting future requirements and preparing ahead of time. That might be preparation for a future feature, extension capabilities that aren’t needed yet, or customization that may or may not be wanted.
I believe that creating premature infrastructures is one of the biggest problems in software development.</description>

      <description>This blog posts shares the results of the third annual State of WebAssembly survey, where we found that Rust and JavaScript usage continues to increase, but there is a growing desire for Zig and Kotlin. The use of wasm as a plugin environment continues to climb,  with developers hoping it will deliver of the “write once and run anywhere” promise.</description>

      <title>AppSec loves Agile</title>
      <link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/appsec_loves_agile/</link>
      <description>I describe myself as an Agile Fundamentalist because I really like the ideas of the Agile manifesto, and I also confidently state that I am an AppSec snooper, because in my day job I tend to look at other people’s code, logs and systems and break them. I happen to think that agile and application security go together rather well!
I had two different Slack conversations recently. One was on the UK cross-governmental #security Slack channel and the other one was on the Equal Experts #securit-ee Slack channel (yes I’m a consultant, and our Slack channels have hilariously got ee in their names).</description>

      <link>https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/drm-free-e-books-are-now-available-heres-why-thats-a-big-deal</link>
      <description>Since e-books first emerged as a way for readers to consume content digitally, publishers and authors have required content aggregators to apply Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to the e-books they sell to libraries to prevent the unauthorized use, copying, and redistribution of these materials. While this practice has given publishers and authors peace of mind that sales won’t be lost to piracy or other unauthorized sharing, it has placed undue restrictions on readers who rely on institutional access to e-books.</description>
