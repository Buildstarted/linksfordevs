      <title>Botnet Part 2: The Web is Broken</title>
      <link>https://jan.wildeboer.net/2025/04/Web-is-Broken-Botnet-Part-2/</link>
      <description>I guess you have all heard about the growing problem of AI companies trying to aggressively collect whatever data they can get their hands on to train their models. This has caused an explosive surge in web crawlers relentlessly hitting servers big and small. But who runs these crawlers? Turns out — it could be you!</description>

      <title>Writing an LLM from scratch, part 11 -- batches</title>
      <link>https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/04/llm-from-scratch-11-batches</link>
      <description>Batching speeds up training and inference, but for LLMs we can't just use matrices for it -- we need higher-order tensors.</description>

      <title>The Icelandic voting system</title>
      <link>https://smarimccarthy.is/posts/2024-11-25-voting-system/</link>
      <description>It’s election season here in Iceland! The election is on Saturday, 30th of November, so next Saturday from when this is written.
Every time elections are upcoming, somebody inevitably asks me how the voting system here works, probably expecting a simple answer. So, here’s a stab at it.
Iceland uses a biproportional apportionment system, as do Norway, some cantons of Switzerland, some German regions, and a few other places. Such systems have a few general features:</description>

      <title>WarRoom / Technology // OpenAI o3/o4-mini Models Exhibit Hallucinations and Geolocation Prowess</title>
      <link>https://thewarroom.news/cluster/2859</link>
      <description>OpenAI has recently introduced its new o3 and o4-mini AI models that are integrated into ChatGPT. Reports indicate these models not only hallucinate more often than previous versions but also demonstrate an uncanny ability to determine photo locations. This duality of increased factual errors alongside unexpected geolocation proficiency has raised concerns among users and experts regarding model reliability and potential privacy implications. The coverage highlights both the technical achievements and challenges of incorporating these advanced AI capabilities.</description>

      <title>UI tip: maybe don't round percentages to 0% or 100%</title>
      <link>https://evanhahn.com/maybe-dont-round-percentages-to-0-or-100-percent/</link>
      <description>Rounding to 0% is bad because the user may think there's been no progress. Rounding to 100% is bad because the user may think things are done when they aren't.</description>

      <title>Design systems need a colour space</title>
      <link>https://bjango.com/articles/designsystemcolourspace/</link>
      <description>Imagine walking into a shoe store and asking for size 10 sneakers. You may end up with shoes that fit, but “size 10” isn’t descriptive enough to be sure — the US, UK, EU, Australia, and Japan all have different shoe sizing systems. To ensure you get shoes that fit, it’d be wise to be more specific and ask for “size 10 US” or “size 10 EU”.</description>

      <description>If you have files on an external USB drive connected to your Proxmox host and need to access them from a Windows Server virtual machine (VM), you can use Proxmox’s USB passthrough feature. This method is simple and ideal for one-time or occasional file access, requiring no additional software.</description>

      <title>Navigating Evolving Code Standards Without Chaos - Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=7pThW-UTzr8</link>
      <description>Even with the best intentions, codebases that live on for an extended period of time eventually experience some drift. We might set ourselves up with the best patterns and practices, but in 1, 3, 5, or 10 years from now... things change.

How might we consider navigating codebases that evolve over time?

As with all livestreams, I'm looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.
