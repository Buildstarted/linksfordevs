Learn about HybridCache, an exciting new caching library in .NET 9! This tutorial covers how to implement hybrid caching by combining local in-memory caching with Redis distributed caching using just a few lines of code. We&amp;#39;ll explore the new HybridCacheEntryOptions, set up expiration times, and show you how to efficiently manage your application&amp;#39;s cache across different storage layers. HybridCache solves many of the drawbacks of the existing caching implementations we have today.

      <title>Bluesky and Decentralization -- Dustycloud Brainstorms</title>
      <link>https://dustycloud.org/blog/re-re-bluesky-decentralization/</link>
      <description>A few weeks ago I wrote
How decentralized is Bluesky really?,
a blogpost which received far more attention than I expected on the
fediverse and Bluesky both.  Thankfully, the blogpost was received
well generally, including by Bluesky&amp;#39;s team.  Bryan Newbold, core
Bluesky engineer, wrote a thoughtful response article:
Reply on Bluesky and Decentralization,
which I consider worth reading.</description>
