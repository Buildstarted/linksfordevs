      <title>I enforced the AGPL on my code, here&amp;#39;s how it went</title>
      <link>https://raymii.org/s/blog/I_enforced_the_AGPL_on_my_code_heres_how_it_went.html</link>
      <description>Five years ago I made a website that allowed you to put in a few domains and get 
an email when the SSL certificate was about to expire. No ads, no fuss, just
an easy way for people to keep tabs on their sites without setting up their
own monitoring like Nagios. As with all of my software, I released it under
the GPL, specificaly the AGPL due to it being web based software. The AGPL
differs from the GPL on one point, simplified, you have to release the source
of any modifications you make under the same license, even when you host the software (not distribute)
online. With the regular GPL, you don&amp;#39;t have to release the source if you 
provide a modified version online, only if you distribute it.</description>

      <description>One of the most common “data type” in programming is the text string. When programmers think of a string, they imagine that they are dealing with a list or an array of characters. It is often a “good enough” approximation, but reality is more complex. The characters must be encoded into bits in some way.&amp;#160;Most … Continue reading Ridiculously fast unicode (UTF-8) validation</description>

      <title>The accelerating adoption of Julia</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/834571/e8d7adc0d9b669bc/</link>
      <description>The Julia programming language has
seen a major increase in its use and popularity over the last few years.
We last looked at it two years ago, around the time of the Julia 1.0
release.  Here, we will look at some of the changes since that release,
none of which are major, as well as some newer resources for learning the
language, but the main focus of this article is a case study that is meant
to help show why the language has been taking off.  A follow-up article
will introduce a new computational notebook for Julia, called Pluto, that is akin to Jupyter notebooks.</description>

      <title>What sacrifices do you need to take in order to achieve your goal?</title>
      <link>https://hoanhan.co/what-sacrifices-you-need-achive-your-goal</link>
      <description>Let me know if you agree to these: Everyone wants to have an amazing job and financial independence but not everyone wants to sacrifice their late nights and weekends, do unpleasant paperwork, practice networking, or take lots of risks even though it’s not guaranteed to be successful. Everyone wants to have a great relationship but not everyone wants to go through tough conversations and discuss about feelings and emotions. Everyone wants to have a strong and healthy body but not everyone appreciates the pain of working out and eating strictly.</description>

      <title>Give your variables better values</title>
      <link>http://amortizedcost.net/give-your-variables-better-values/</link>
      <description>

Sometimes I notice that some developers are quite good at giving good names to
variables but they are not paying much attention to actual variable values.
Usually, it happens in test cases. I absolutely got the reason why it happens:
tests are written after the implementation, people are in rush and destructed by
annoying static analysis issues, you name it.

Code is written for people and only then for machines. So when it comes to
reading through the tests cases written in such manner we bec</description>

      <title>Why I don&amp;#39;t take notes</title>
      <link>https://findka.com/blog/why-i-dont-take-notes/</link>
      <description>I took copious notes when I started college. By the halfway point, I had
completely stopped taking notes. I found that taking notes didn&amp;#39;t help me
learn; it was just a distraction that made it harder for me to comprehend the
lecture. I graduated almost three years ago, and so far I still thoroughly
enjoy not taking notes on anything.</description>

      <title>Stupid Moves</title>
      <link>https://koratkar.com/2020/10/20/Stupid-moves</link>
      <description>There are a few different species of stupid moves you can make in relation to the amount of people around you. You can do stupid things to impress other people, or at least to get their attention. This can be something like throwing yourself into a pool around other people without a change of clothes, or something much more dangerous. Regardless, you do it mainly for others. Another stupid action is caused by what I like to call “group inertia”. Everyone in the group thinks it’s a unwise course of action, but no one speaks up about it. An object in motion (in this case, a group of people) likes to stay in motion. Group related unwise desicions are always worth avoiding, they are never fruitful. I think a good example of this is adults and alchohol. As a group drinks itself into heavy intoxication, no one can stop the motion.</description>

      <title>Early Work</title>
      <link>http://paulgraham.com/early.html</link>
      <description>One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work
is the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an
irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on
where they don&amp;#39;t seem very impressive, even to their creators. You
have to push through this stage to reach the great work that lies
beyond. But many people don&amp;#39;t. Most people don&amp;#39;t even reach the
stage of making something they&amp;#39;re embarrassed by, let alone continue
past it. They&amp;#39;re too frightened even to start.</description>
