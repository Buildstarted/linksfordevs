      <description>Junie is one of the best coding agent I've been trying out so far. Very well integrated with IntelliJ, great for Kotlin, and the test first focus makes it quite good at coming out with good results. However, I do miss the capability to only accept part of a solution and it can be very slowwwwww.</description>

      <description>We treat knowledge like so much cargo. Stack it high enough, gather enough people, and surely you'll reach critical mass. Twenty smart people, each with a year of experience, must be just as good as one person with twenty years. Right?
