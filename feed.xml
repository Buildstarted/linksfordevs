      <link>https://aneesh.mataroa.blog/blog/cloud-isnt-just-someone-elses-computer/</link>
      <description>Ok, i mean, it IS indeed just someone else&amp;#39;s computer. For the most part, it&amp;#39;s either owned by Amazon, Google or Microsoft, and you&amp;#39;re just running your code on their machines. But.. the change is much more nuanced than just a computer that you rent as opposed to using your own. Softwares have undergone significant changes to adapt to the cloud paradigm, in order to leverage the elasticity and commodity hardware available. I want to illustrate this adaptation by taking the example of snowflake - the elastic data warehouse.</description>

      <description>This article is a discussion about API clients. Without being a comparison between the best API clients, this article talks about the pros and cons of some popular tools to send HTTP requests to an API. The goal is not to elect the best one, but rather to try to answer the following question: what we should consider when choosing an API client, and what are the challenges when using one?</description>
