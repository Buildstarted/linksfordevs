      <title>Auditing a Graded Video Game – Zdziarski&amp;#39;s Blog of Things</title>
      <link>https://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=10051</link>
      <description>Anyone who’s read my blog knows that I am not a fan of video game grading. Grading companies, in my experience, do marginal quality work, and at a superficial level that cannot be audited once an item has been sealed. The holy plastic WATA box is all too often used to convince sellers that their item somehow has more value than it actually does, and buyers the frustration of passing over finds because of greedy sellers who drank the kool-aid.&amp;#160;Overall, video game grading has done more harm to the hobby than good.</description>

      <link>https://jon.bo/posts/can-blogging-be-simple/</link>
      <description>as much as I love my blog, suggesting others start their own like I did is too tall a technical ask. The hosted options come with their own pitfalls. Is there a better way? What might it look like? How do we get there?
Over the past few years I’ve advised many friends to start blogging – or to put it more directly, to start putting their wonderful thoughts and ideas online for others to find.</description>

      <title>How bad are bad fundraising terms?</title>
      <link>https://www.benkuhn.net/terms/</link>
      <description>Suppose you took a job at Square in November 2014. A stock option package you valued at $500k then would have become worthless a year later, when they IPOed at less than half their previous valuation. Yet it seems like Square did quite well in 2015. What’s going on? I go over the startling findings of a new research paper that explains this and lots of other venture capital mysteries.</description>

      <title>“Play-to-earn” and Bullshit Jobs</title>
      <link>https://paulbutler.org/2021/play-to-earn-and-bullshit-jobs/</link>
      <description>In Bullshit Jobs: A Theory, David Graeber makes the case that a sizable chunk of the labour economy is essentially people performing useless work, as a sort of subconscious self-preservation instinct of the economic status quo. The book cites ample anecdotal evidence that people perceive their own jobs as completely disconnected from any sort of value creation, and makes the case that the ruling class stands to lose from the proletariat having extra free time on their hands. It’s a thoughtfully presented case, but when I read the book a few years back, I was skeptical that any mechanism to create bullshit jobs could arise from a system as inherently Darwinian as capitalism.</description>

      <link>https://destevez.net/2021/12/decoding-james-webb-space-telescope/</link>
      <description>The James Webb Space Telescope probably needs no introduction, since it is perhaps the most important and well-known mission of the last years. It was launched on Christmas day from Kourou, French Guiana, into a direct transfer orbit to the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point. JWST uses S-band at 2270.5 MHz to transmit telemetry. The science data will be transmitted in K-band at 29.5 GHz, with a rate of up to 28 Mbps.</description>
