      <title>PostgreSQL in C# .NET with Npgsql, Dapper, and Entity Framework: The Complete Guide</title>
      <link>https://michaelscodingspot.com/postgres-in-csharp/</link>
      <description>One of the most used databases these days is PostgreSQL (aka Postgres). Its accomplishments include being the most popular DB [among professional developers] according to Stack Overflow survey of 2022, the database in all of the fastest TechEmpower benchmarks, and being the most advanced open source database (self-proclaimed).
We’ll talk today about combining Postgres with my favorite language and runtime: C# and .NET. Just because Postgres isn’t a first-party Microsoft database, like SQL Server, doesn’t mean you don’t have full support for it in C#.</description>

      <title>A Button Only Date Picker and JavaScript Date Control Binding</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2023/Feb/06/A-Button-Only-Date-Picker-and-JavaScript-Date-Control-Binding</link>
      <description>The native date picker in HTML is a bit of a pain to work with as it&amp;#39;s overly simplistic in features and how you have to assign and retrieve values from it. It also isn&amp;#39;t customizable so if you need to build custom behavior like a button date popup that doesn&amp;#39;t show the input control, you&amp;#39;re out of luck. In this post I discuss the challenges of the HTML date picker control, provide small component to make binding values easier, and provide an example on how to create a button only date picker both with plain JavaScript and as a small Vue component.</description>

      <link>https://andysylvester.com/2023/02/06/demo-of-mystatustool-twitter-using-rss-and-rsscloud/</link>
      <description>I have created a proof of concept for a microblogging tool relying on RSS for data storage and rssCloud for notification. I was motivated to do this to show how rssCloud could be used to support a Twitter-like experience. Also, I was blocked for posting an innocuous comment on the FeedLand user feed tool, and felt that there needed to be an alternative to that tool for microblog posting. My earlier posts on the development of this tool are here and here.</description>

      <link>https://blog.tugzrida.xyz/2023/02/06/introducing-the-ipv6-canvas/</link>
      <description>A few years ago the IPv6 christmas tree emerged as a festive (ab)use of IPv6’s vast address space. There’ve been a few variants on the concept in the meantime, but none of them seem to be active currently. I’ve wanted to play with IPv6 ranges on public cloud providers, so this seemed as good an excuse as any. Have play with the canvas, or keep reading for the behind-the-scenes.</description>

      <title>When Social Media Moderation Becomes Our Responsibility &amp;#183; Notes</title>
      <link>https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2023/moderating-instances-mastodon-blocking/</link>
      <description>Being in the fediverse today is a familiar and weird experience at the same time.
On the surface, it&amp;amp;amp;rsquo;s all very similar to Twitter and other social networks. Yes, the system for following/finding someone is kind of clunky and there are unique features and conventions there, like the “content warning” and the emphasis on image descriptions. These details are quickly learned, though.
Things can get (and do) more complex.
Time and again, differences emerge between instances (themselves, a difficult concept to explain) and groups of users, such as long-time users and newcomers coming from Twitter.</description>

      <title>LMNT: Square</title>
      <link>https://lmnt.me/post/square.html</link>
      <description>Back in the days of Tapulous, I was working with an interaction designer from Perth, Australia. Since I was mostly a visual designer, Clarko and I worked together to create the UI in most Tapulous apps. After many of us left the company, Clarko was staying at my Mountain View apartment for a bit while we were all figuring out what to do next. Also occasionally at my apartment were other designers and engineers, like Brad Ellis.</description>

      <title>I built a new tab page to look at old pictures</title>
      <link>https://yboulkaid.com/2023/02/06/new-tab-picture.html</link>
      <description>Photography is my main hobby. I have been taking pictures for 17 years now, and while I have a selection of my best work, 17 years worth of pictures is a lot more than that.</description>

      <title>Perhaps something was rotten in Skylake – Gabriel Sieben</title>
      <link>https://gabrielsieben.tech/2023/02/06/perhaps-something-was-rotten-in-skylake/</link>
      <description>Here’s yet another theory that could partially explain why Windows 11 doesn’t support anything below Intel 8th Gen: Something’s really borked in Skylake (Intel 6th Gen), and operating systems are eager to get away from it. And, when possible, the refresh (7th gen).</description>

      <title>It is becoming difficult for me to be productive in Python - blag</title>
      <link>https://avi.im/blag/2023/refactoring-python/</link>
      <description>It’s harder to refactor a large Python codebase. Type hints won’t save you, and you need a lot of unit tests. But how does that work in practice? Is Python fast to ship?</description>
