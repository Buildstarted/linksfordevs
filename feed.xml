      <title>Advice for the next dozen Rust GUIs</title>
      <link>https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/gui/2022/07/15/next-dozen-guis.html</link>
      <description>A few times a week, someone asks on the #gui-and-ui channel on the Rust Discord, “what is the best UI toolkit for my application?” Unfortunately there is still no clear answer to this question. Generally the top contenders are egui, Iced, and Druid, but web-based approaches are in the running, and of course there’s always the temptation to just build a new one. And every couple or months or so, a post appears with a new GUI toolkit.</description>

      <description>Theme parks are great – but only if you trust they’re secure. The same is true for the internet. A new EU law would make website security weaker by imposing QWACs and expose users to more cyber risks.</description>

      <title>learning braille</title>
      <link>https://hippocanvas.com/posts/learning%20braille.md</link>
      <description>Many years ago, I shared office space with a fascinating man named Mike. An elderly fellow with a long career in finance, every morning he would plop into his Aeron and spend the day making calls to his buddies, probably to invite them to give talks or join new financial initiatives. He had severe losses in his hearing, which he had transformed into impressive gains in speaking loudness. All the sound waves that missed his speakerphone simply spilled to the rest of the office. The students nearby got a kick from overhearing his conversations because of his no-shits-given attitude and dark humor. He would tell his friends: I have 3 children, each of them flawed in their own ways, but they have given me 6 grandchildren, each of them perfect -- grandchildren are God&amp;#39;s way of telling you to not kill your children!</description>

      <title>The Golden Age of Vertical ERPs - Part 1/3</title>
      <link>https://www.matttbrown.com/notes/the-golden-age-of-vertical-erps</link>
      <description>Vertical ERPs (VERPs) will be one of the largest and most exciting software categories over the next decade. VERPs are purpose-built applications that centralize and automate core processes for a particular type of business (such as Toast, Mindbody, and Bonsai), consolidating the everyday workflows that would otherwise require a patchwork of tools.</description>

      <description>I blogged about Dart a few weeks ago, and I said it was refreshingly boring. I am probably late to the party (well, evidently I am, as it’s been around since 2014), but I discovered Crystal recently, and it is not only boring but also surprising in many delicious ways.</description>

      <description>For the entirety of this post, we assume a non-real-time system. First of all, why do we have TIMEOUT as a type of replies? What if we don&amp;#39;t? This means, in some cases, either client or server (or both) can be &amp;quot;blocked&amp;quot; for an unbounded amount of time. With async</description>

      <description>About The Iron Searcher Between this previous post, where I share my excitement for the Crystal programming language, and this more recent previous post, where I go over my own take at The Silver Seacher but in Ruby, I decided to try out my own take at a file search command line utility but in Crystal, and thus The Iron Searcher was born (Go read the README for what’s in a name and more).</description>

      <title>Fighting WebView2 Visibility on Initialization</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Jul/14/Fighting-WebView2-Visibility-on-Initialization</link>
      <description>The WebView2 control has a clever &amp;#39;feature&amp;#39; that doesn&amp;#39;t fully initialize the WebView control if it&amp;#39;s not UI visible. While this can save resources in some scenarios it can also make for some very annoying behavior that causes startup timing and flickering issues. In this post I describe a few scenarios where this initial visibility delay loading can cause issues and show a trick you can use to get around it if this &amp;#39;feature&amp;#39; causes a problem.</description>
