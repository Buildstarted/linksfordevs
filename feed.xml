      <title>Tool - Personal Goal Report Card</title>
      <link>https://blog.robertsimoes.org/posts/tool--personal-goal-report-card/</link>
      <description>Personal goal setting is a common habit for each new year. For the past several years, I’ve set goals for the coming new year while also reflecting and reviewing on how I did during the year. More often than not, I fall short of my ambition in so far as I had a cross-off-worthy outcome; how dreadful, to deny that sweet satisfaction. At the same time, however, I often have made some progress towards a goal but, for whatever reason: uncontrollable factors, escalating priorities, laziness, life events, et cetera, the progress stalled or stopped.</description>

      <title>LLM security - Introduction</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2023/12/18/ai-llm-security-part1.html</link>
      <description>Since I quit my job couple months back, I’ve been tinkering around with various emerging technologies. I have been pretty obsessed with the current AI evolution of large language models (LLMs) and their surprising text generation capabilities. Whether you are surprised or not, people have started integrating them into just about every software we interact with and after spending countless hours asking it to generate song lyrics, I eventually wanted to understand what was happening behind the scenes. I am no AI engineer and I barely remember the Machine learning/ Neural network courses I took in college, but given my computer security background, what better way to learn how these LLM’s work than by trying to break them? In this post, we look at the basics of AI security, current “known” attacks, common defenses and some CTF challenges. I’ve been meaning to write this post for a while but this field was moving so fast that keeping up latest publications is a full time job. Now that NeurIPS is over and things have calmed down, I finally got time to work on this.</description>

      <title>Being Stuck in Someone Else’s Theory</title>
      <link>https://jimmyhmiller.github.io/stuck</link>
      <description>Software development can be an incredibly frustrating venture. Not primarily because programming is hard and we often make mistakes. Nor because there are countless tedious things like dependency management that we have to deal with. Nor because we are confronted by an overwhelming number of choices on what library or framework to use. Instead, I think the primary reason stems from something much more deeply unsettling, being forced to live in someone else’s theory.</description>

      <title>PostgreSQL Internals: 3 Things to Know About UPDATE Statements</title>
      <link>https://patrick.engineering/posts/postgres-internals/</link>
      <description>I recently finished reading PostgreSQL 14 Internals by Egor Rogov. It is one of the great books that teach applied computer science without watering down the difficult parts.
One particularly interesting topic is PostgreSQL’s execution of UPDATE statements. Updates in relational databases are inherently complex. They can be affected by conflicts, anomalies, and deadlocks. However, some behavior is specific to PostgreSQL. This can lead to surprises.
1. Write Amplification PostgreSQL generally does not update rows in-place.</description>
