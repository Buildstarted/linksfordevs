      <title>Rehearsing a sabbatical &amp;#183; Max Gorin</title>
      <link>https://mxgrn.com/blog/rehearsing-a-sabbatical</link>
      <description>This fall, I went hiking in the Nepali Himalayas for the first time since the pandemic. A village called Namche Bazar is my favorite place to unwind from work, and usually I need at least a month off to get properly recharged. This time, even though I took a whole 6 weeks, I decided I needed more, but not because I got exceptionally tired of my current job.</description>

      <title>How I spent two months doing nothing</title>
      <link>https://proofinprogress.com/posts/2022-12-28/How-I-spent-two-months-doing-nothing.html</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;m really struggling with being productive these days. As seen on my GitHub contributors activity, I last shipped code two months ago. And only just sitting here writing kind of bores me too. I&amp;#39;ve reflected on what makes me bored: Am I burned out? Am I just taking a break? Why now? And what am I doing with all of this free time?</description>

      <description>I still remember when I started working as an intern data scientist and I had to open my first pull request. I was very happy with my work, so I just committed all my changes together, opened a pull request, assigned it to my supervisor, and started waiting for the compliments to arrive - spoiler: the compliments never arrived.</description>

      <title>The Catch-22 of Democracy - Pravesh Koirala</title>
      <link>https://praveshkoirala.com/2022/12/28/the-catch-22-of-democracy/</link>
      <description>There have been many things written and said about Democracy. I agree with some of those, disagree with the most. Unlike many people believe, I do not consider Democracy as the best system of governance. In my academically (or otherwise) limited opinion, it&amp;#39;s just the better among all the worst that we can possibly choose.</description>

      <title>Human-Oriented Automatic Theorem Proving</title>
      <link>https://wtgowers.github.io/human-style-atp/</link>
      <description>This is the website for an automatic theorem proving project funded by the Astera Institute. It is based in Cambridge, but we are open to remote collaboration with others who may be interested. The focus will be on traditional programming methods, but we hope and expect that some of the work we do will have the potential to feed into approaches based on machine learning.</description>

      <title>The Service and the Beast: Building a Windows Service that Does Not Fail to Restart </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/articles/windows-services-reliable-restart/</link>
      <description>Windows Services play a key role in the Microsoft Windows operating system, and support the creation and management of long-running processes. When &amp;#160;“Fast Startup” is enabled and the PC is started after a regular shutdown, though, services may fail to restart. The aim of this article is to create a persistent service that will always run and restart after Windows restarts, or after shutdown.</description>
