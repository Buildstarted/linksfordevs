      <title>Adhering to Consent with Cookie Information for Episerver</title>
      <link>https://www.codeart.dk/blog/2021/1/adhering-to-consent-with-cookie-information-for-episerver/</link>

      <link>https://blog.dachary.org/2021/01/23/federated-development-and-federated-forges/</link>
      <description>I’m very new federation. Over the years I heard rumors that it was good without understanding why and how. I ran a mastodon instance for a few years but did not use it much: I’m a developer and not much of a microblogger (reading or writing). Beginning of last year I started using https://peer.tube/ and was happy to see it work for real but did not use any of its federated features. But when https://joinmobilizon.org/ was announced I thought it made a lot of sense to organize events in a federated way: smart move. And all along I thought I should read about fediverse but I still have no idea what it means (really).</description>

The program’s print and shift instructions are relegated to being labels for the edges. Here’s an example:</description>

      <description>At the start of December, I switched jobs to a new games company. While I really enjoyed being a lead programmer at my previous company, I found it difficult to combine both my leadership and programming responsibilities. I ended up feeling like I wasn’t doing my best work on either. My calendar often looked like Swiss cheese, with small meetings interspersed throughout my day. I’ve taken a step back on my leadership responsibilities now, so I can focus more on writing code.</description>
