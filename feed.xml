      <title>Assessing the Impact of Mask Mandates on SARS-CoV-2 Transmission: A Case Study of Utah</title>
      <link>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.13.23298464v1</link>
      <description>Background Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of face masks mandates has been intensely debated. Many methods have been used to demonstrate mask effectiveness, including one that compares the change in reproduction number following implementing and removing face mask mandates[1][1].

Methods Using data from Utah, we calculated the effect of mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district from before and after three key mandates: the Salt Lake and Summit County (SLSC) mask mandates enacted; the Utah statewide mask mandate enacted; and the Utah statewide mandate was lifted.

Results We found that most counties had a reduction in the growth rate of cases following the mandates. There were reductions in EFm in many counties after the introduction of the SLSC mask mandates and a more widespread reduction in EFm across the state following the statewide mandate. Lifting the mandates, many counties across the states saw an increase in EFm.

Conclusion Our data show mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission both within the jurisdiction they were enacted and in neighboring jurisdictions. We provide evidence to support mask mandates as a way to prevent transmission to be better equipped to respond to future pandemics.

      <title>How To Use EF Core Interceptors</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/how-to-use-ef-core-interceptors</link>
      <description>EF Core is my favorite ORM for .NET applications. Yet, its many fantastic features sometimes go unnoticed. For example, query splitting, query filters, and interceptors.
EF interceptors are interesting because you can do powerful things with them. For example, you can hook into materialization, handle optimistic concurrency errors, or add query hints.
The most practical use case is adding behavior when saving changes to the database.</description>

      <link>https://www.garymm.org/blog/2023/11/10/the-dangers-of-reproducing-while-old/</link>
      <description>I had my first child when I was 36 years old, which made me want to understand the risks of having children at different ages. Before looking into this, my impression was that the main biological problems with old-age parenthood had to do with not having the necessary health and vigor to care for young’uns, and I had heard that older women have trouble getting pregnant. While those are real issues, there are many others worthy of consideration.</description>

      <title>The Entropic
Framework for Cardinality Bounds</title>
      <link>https://remy.wang/blog/entropy-card.html</link>
      <description>One of the most exciting developments in database theory in recent
years is the entropic framework for cardinality bounds, which emerges
from deep connections between database theory and information theory. In
this blog post, I explain the fundamental concepts and key steps for
estimating join size via information inequalities. This post is based on
a lecture by Dan Suciu during the Simons Institute program Logic
and Algorithms in Database Theory and AI. The technique is developed
in a line of work including AGM13, GLVV12,
GM14, ANS16, ANS17. See Suc23 for a wonderful survey
of the literature.</description>

      <title>Don&amp;#39;t hijack our browser shortcuts</title>
      <link>https://josem.co/dont-hijack-our-browser-shortcuts/</link>
      <description>I’m angry today.
As web apps become increasingly complex, developers need more shortcuts to map various actions. Now we have countless shortcuts for any site.
Take GitHub’s shortcuts as an example; they have a few.
But there’s a limit, and I’m here to draw that line.
Your website shouldn’t hijack the default browser shortcuts.
Don’t assume your feature is more important than years of muscle memory. I want to get things done, but I feel lost when I use a shortcut, and your website does something else instead or tries to replace the default behavior of the browser.</description>
