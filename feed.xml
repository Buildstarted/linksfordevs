      <title>Easy Pagination for Entity Framework in 3 steps</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/09285b33-79e6-4879-95e0-35aeae5fbcc6</link>
      <description>Pagination is the process of dividing a set into discrete pages. In the context of Entity Framework, that means we are only getting a certain amount of entries from the database.
And we will implement a very easy solution to make that happen in 3 steps. The result will look like this:
var pagedList = DbContext.BlogPosts.ToPagedList(page: 1, pageSize: 5);

      <title>Index Types in PostgreSQL: Learning PostgreSQL with Grant - Simple Talk</title>
      <link>https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/postgresql/index-types-in-postgresql-learning-postgresql-with-grant/</link>
      <description>As with any other relational data management system (RDBMS), PostgreSQL uses indexes as a mechanism to improve data access. PostgreSQL has a number of different index types, supporting different behaviors and different types of data. In addition, again, similar to other RDBMS, there are properties and behaviors associated with these indexes.  In this article I’m going to go over the different types of indexes and some index behaviors. We’ll get into what the indexes are, how they work, and how best you can apply them within your databases. I’m hoping you’ll develop an understanding of which indexes are likely to work better in each situation.</description>

      <description>Over the past years I attended hundreds of interviews. Many candidates proudly told tales on how they develop their projects with a microservice architecture. Often (I don’t want to say “always”, but from my memory I think it actually is “always”) it does not require many questions to see that they used a rocket launcher to kill a mouse. Microservices are hard. Everyone who experienced the pain of operating such an architecture can relate to it. The complexity kills you at one point or the other. You already had to do multiple refactorings of your architecture - because your domains didn’t work out. I wonder - why is this architecture so appealing to developers? And then I remember what I found them appealing 10 years ago.</description>

      <title>Easy to Overlook Way to Break Eager Loading in Rails Apps </title>
      <link>https://pawelurbanek.com/rails-eager-ordered</link>
      <description>In theory, configuring eager loading to avoid N+1 issues is straightforward. Chaining includes method is usually enough to ensure that all the relations data is fetched efficiently. However, this rule breaks for some easy-to-overlook edge cases. In this blog post, I&amp;#39;ll describe how to eager load ActiveRecord relations using custom SQL ORDER BY sorting.</description>

      <title>Setting up ActiveStorage with Cloudflare R2</title>
      <link>https://kirillplatonov.com/posts/activestorage-cloudflare-r2/</link>
      <description>Cloudflare R2 is a new object storage that has been launched in 2022. It offers S3-compatible storage with built-in CDN. The pricing is much simpler and affordable compared to the combination of AWS S3 + Cloudfront which are commonly used for the same goal. Another benefit is that you don’t have to pay for data transfer between AWS regions.</description>

      <title>Is it worth encrypting? | Matthew Linkous</title>
      <link>https://www.matthewlinkous.com/p/encryption-worthy</link>
      <description>Today, nearly all of our data is backed up to the cloud. Often times our only copy of our important information will live on some far away server outside of our control. This comes with clear privacy risks. If our data is on someone else’s machine, in their hands, they are free to peek into that data without us consenting or even knowing. It’s even the business model of many of the biggest companies in the world to read private data to better target advertisements. This is a problem that is often met with a simple solution: encrypt your data.</description>

      <description>For our 200th episode, I&amp;#39;m going to explain exactly what went wrong in the Japanese software industry.&amp;#160; I&amp;#39;ll lay out the whole story, and also pinpoint the specific moment Japan lost its way. And by the end you&amp;#39;ll also understand why everything might be about to change.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;You see, the story of Japanese software is not really the story of software. It&amp;#39;s the story of Japanese innovation itself.&amp;#160;</description>
