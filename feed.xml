      <title>Rib :ms_red_panda: (@Rib)</title>
      <link>https://fedi.rib.gay/notes/a6xqityngfubsz0f</link>
      <description>Today Melissa Lewis over on BlueSky pointed out that the font used in the infamous "You wouldn't steal a car" anti-piracy campaign was actually designed by Just van Rossum, whose brother, Guido, created the Python programming language (https://bsky.app/profile/melissa.news/post/3ln7hx5rhcj2v)

She also pointed out that the font had been cloned and released illegally for free under the name "XBAND Rough". Naturally, it would be hilarious if the anti-piracy campaign actually turned out to have used this pirated font, so I went sleuthing and quickly found a PDF from the campaign site with the font embedded (https://web.archive.org/web/20051223202935/http://www.piracyisacrime.com:80/press/pdfs/150605_8PP_brochure.pdf).

So I chucked it into FontForge and yep, turns out the campaign used a pirated font the entire time! üìé</description>

      <title>14 Advanced Python Features</title>
      <link>https://blog.edward-li.com/tech/advanced-python-features/</link>
      <description>Python is one of the most widely adopted programming languages in the world. Yet, because of it‚Äôs ease and simplicity to just ‚Äúget something working‚Äù, it‚Äôs also one of the most underappreciated.
If you search for Top 10 Advanced Python Tricks on Google or any other search engine, you‚Äôll find tons of blogs or LinkedIn articles going over trivial (but still useful) things like generators or tuples.
However, as someone who‚Äôs written Python for the past 12 years, I‚Äôve come across a lot of really interesting, underrated, unique, or (as some might say) ‚Äúun-pythonic‚Äù tricks to really level up what Python can do.</description>

      <description>It is wonderful to see the growing number of people working on digital commons, inventing and improving technologies to the benefit of all humanity. 42 of such projects have been selected for funding in the October call of the NGI Zero Commons Fund. In terms of applications, it was the largest call round in NGI Zero's life time.
