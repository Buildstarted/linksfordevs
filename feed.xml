      <title>Working Smarter: 5 Steps to Getting Unstuck</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugz6XdT5smA</link>
      <description>A personal story from my first tech job that change my outlook on &amp;quot;there is no such thing as a dumb question.&amp;quot; In this session we will learn 5 points with examples of asking effective questions on the internet (stack overflow, medium, google in general) and to team members. We will walk through an example of a technical problem that might get you stuck (with code samples) and how to go through the 5 steps to getting unstuck. With summarizing 5 steps, talk aways, and ending with story from personal experience how using these steps have helped me work smarter and decreased levels of imposter syndrome by not feeling my questions &amp;quot;were dumb questions&amp;quot;.</description>

      <title>Analyzing firmware from embedded devices</title>
      <link>https://sophielemos.com/posts/modifying_firmware/</link>
      <description>Lately I have been analyzing some embedded devices such as routers, and want to share how to emulate, extract, and modify firmware.
We may want to do this for several reasons, such as enabling SSH/telnet to debug a service remotely, adding new features and looking for security vulnerabilities.
If you want to dump the firmware from a physical device, you will want to use something such as the CH341A, but it won&amp;amp;rsquo;t be covered here.</description>

      <title>How I Translate Feature Requests into Code</title>
      <link>https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/turning-feature-requests-into-code/</link>
      <description>As part of my previous job I worked on a CAD/CAM package, and a very common task would be to take a vague feature description, rephrase it as a more formal software problem, then use computational geometry algorithms to turn it into code which can be integrated into the overall application.
I eventually got quite good at this, so I’m going to write down the system I came up with. This process works especially well for larger features which add new functionality with minimal coupling to existing code.</description>

      <title>A Chain Just Cut Through A Capsized Cargo Ship Filled With Cars And The Process Is Fascinating</title>
      <link>https://jalopnik.com/a-chain-just-cut-through-a-capsized-cargo-ship-filled-w-1845784581</link>
      <description>Back in September of 2019, a 600+ foot cargo ship called the MV Golden Ray, which was apparently loaded in an unstable fashion with over 4,000 cars, capsized in St. Simons Sound just off the port of Brunswick, Georgia. Since then, responders have been working to remove the ship in sections to send the hulk to the scrapper. November was particularly exciting, as workers used a chain to cut off the first enormous chunk of ship, revealing mangled cars within. Here’s at look at the fascinating way the team pulled this off.

What’s interesting about these technologies is their APIs were copied across, hinting that Microsoft was considering a .NET Core implementation of them in the future.</description>

      <title>Handling Duplicate Messages (Idempotent Consumers)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeBY8fCWfvU</link>
      <description>Do you create idempotent consumers? &amp;quot;At Least Once&amp;quot; message guarantees that a message will be delivered to a consumer once or many times. This means that you need to develop your consumers to be able to effectively handle duplicate messages. Not doing so could result in some bad outcomes of your system.  For example, processing an order twice, would not likely be a good outcome.  Why do message brokers support &amp;quot;At Least Once&amp;quot; messaging, and how do you handle duplicates?  Here&amp;#39;s how to make idempotent consumers and be resilient to duplicate messages.

      <title>Introduction - Computer Graphics from scratch</title>
