      <description>As I noted in the introduction, classic ARM encodes instructions as as 32-bit values which must reside on a word boundary. However, Windows uses the ARM processor exclusively in a mode known as Thumb-2, which uses a variable-sized encoding format: Instructions can be 16-bit or 32-bit,</description>

      <description>Interop is the subsystem in the runtime that enables interoperability with other systems, like native C libraries or Objective-C. In some cases, it includes a full interop implementation like via P/Invoke or COM interop. In other cases, like for WinRT, it provides the building block APIs such that another (external) component can provide an end-to-end implementation.</description>

      <description>I just finished the writing part of the new edition of the Developer Advocacy Handbook. I wrote the original almost 15 years ago, and this edition is a heavy re-write. A lot has changed in the world of Developer Advocacy and I tried to add my findings over the last few years to the book. It gives you all the basics of becoming a Developer Advocate and explains which channels to cover and how. I deliberately moved away from favouring certain products or social networks as these things change at a fast pace.</description>

      <description>Twenty years ago today, the first email on the postgis users mailing list (at that time hosted on yahoogroups.com) was sent, announcing the first numbered release of PostGIS.



The early history of PostGIS was tightly bound to a consulting company I had started a few years prior, Refractions Research. My early contracts ended up being with British Columbia (BC) provincial government managers w...</description>

      <title>Top 5 Product and Management skills: SQL, Excel, Clear Communication, Story, Prioritization</title>
      <link>https://www.craigkerstiens.com/2021/04/27/top-5-product-and-management-skills-sql-excel-clear-communication-story-prioritization/</link>
      <description>A few months ago there was a tweet from @jasoncwarner about leadership skills/super powers:

SQL
Excel
Concise writing
Story telling
Prioritization.

I’ve spent quite a bit of time in product management roles, and in recent years more in leadership. I’ve found a lot of the skills in product to translate into good leadership skills as well, but maybe I’m bluring the lines there. Regardless, with his 5 skills I found myself nodding and have written about each of these some on my blog and then at times on twitter. He long since deleted the tweet, and while I wait for him to republish I thought I’d reprise a few of these with my own view point.</description>

Of course I&amp;amp;#x2019;m talking about API versioning and not since the great &amp;amp;#x201C;tabs versus spaces&amp;amp;#x201D; debate have I seen so many strong beliefs in entirely different camps.
