      <title>Sleep Hygiene For Software Engineers</title>
      <link>https://sklum.github.io/2020/06/14/sleep-hygiene-for-software-engineers.html</link>
      <description>Software engineers know the importance of sleep; posts extolling its virtues (or the problems associated with its absence) regularly reach the front page of HackerNews. In fact, around the time I finished this post there were two articles on the front page: Fitful nightly sleep linked to chronic inflammation, hardened arteries and Why Sleep Deprivation Kills. Yikes! There’s invariably a comment on sleep-related posts saying something to the effect of, “I know getting good sleep is important, but I don’t know why I’m not sleeping well and I don’t know how to resolve it even if I did!”. Academia offers little help as there’s only a handful of studies focusing on sleep solely for the software engineer.</description>

      <title>The Web Has Got Me</title>
      <link>https://mattharwood.com/the-web-has-got-me</link>
      <description>Last week, I decided to start tackling a problem I've had for a long, long time. Brain fog. It's been getting worse over the years - to the point that I don't realise time has gone by. I forget things instantly. A tipping point was recently being unable to work out a profit margin (rather embarrassing for all concerned!).</description>

      <description>Razor is a sharp user interface language, but it can also cut into our sensibilities and aesthetic code choices. ASP.NET ships with many HTML helpers to help reduce the amount of code we write to ship user interfaces, and for the most part, they work pretty well. With the latest version of ASP.NET, there are techniques we can use to reduce the noise in our views.</description>
