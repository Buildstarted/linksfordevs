      <title>Building an Anomaly Detection System with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://disarli.me/2023/10/08/anomaly-detection-with-recurrent-neural-networks.html</link>
      <description>Industrial plants, aircraft, cybersecurity, but also medicine, finance, and more: anomaly detection systems serve a vital role in numerous contexts, promptly identifying malfunctions and irregularities without the need for (and often outperforming) constant expert oversight. There are multiple types of anomaly detection. In this article, I will demonstrate how to use neural networks to build a simple anomaly detection system specifically for time series data, i.e., the kind of data that is mostly generated by sensors.</description>

      <description>Weight balance is a matter of chemicals and not choices we make. It is complicated. Of course, poor choices can only make things worse. Believe it or not, weight loss isn’t just about eating fewer calories or having more willpower, and it’s a far more complex interchange of biology, genetics, food c</description>

Some basic information is needed just to set the context better, but this is not a “basic introduction to LLM’s” style of post.

      <link>https://www.garymm.org/blog/2023/10/09/multi-language-integration-testing-made-easy-with-bazel/</link>
      <description>When developing mlflow-go, a Go client for MLFlow, I realized integration testing was crucial to ensure correctness. Since the official MLFlow server and client are written in Python, such an integration test would involve multiple languages. Bazel made it easy to set up and automate a multi-language test.</description>

      <title>Don&amp;#39;t Overpay for Bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://sometechblog.com/posts/don-t-overpay-for-bancwidth/</link>
      <description>After adding an embedded video to the landing page of my app I noticed bandwidth usage rose dramatically. The embedded video is auto-loaded for best experience and provides a sleeker experience than a YouTube embed. In a week the landing page videos both the optimized .webm (5.1MB) and .mp4 (20.4MB) consumed close to 25GB of bandwidth.
This would push me out of the free tier and into a steeply priced PRO subscription.</description>

      <description>Recently Microsoft released .NET 8.0 RC. And when we try to load a .NET 8 Web API project in Visual Studio - we will get a message like this. - The current Visual Studio version does not support targeting .NET 8.0. Either target .NET 7.0 or lower, or use Visual Studio version 17.8 or higher.</description>

      <title>Fair coins tend to land on the same side they started: Evidence from 350,757 Flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04153</link>
      <description>Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process. In a preregistered study we collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed by Persi Diaconis. The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started -- Diaconis estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51%. Our data lend strong support to this precise prediction: the coins landed on the same side more often than not, $	ext{Pr}(	ext{same side}) = 0.508$, 95% credible interval (CI) [$0.506$, $0.509$], $	ext{BF}_{	ext{same-side bias}} = 2364$. Furthermore, the data revealed considerable between-people variation in the degree of this same-side bias. Our data also confirmed the generic prediction that when people flip an ordinary coin -- with the initial side-up randomly determined -- it is equally likely to land heads or tails: $	ext{Pr}(	ext{heads}) = 0.500$, 95% CI [$0.498$, $0.502$], $	ext{BF}_{	ext{heads-tails bias}} = 0.183$. Furthermore, this lack of heads-tails bias does not appear to vary across coins. Our data therefore provide strong evidence that when some (but not all) people flip a fair coin, it tends to land on the same side it started. Our data provide compelling statistical support for Diaconis&amp;#39; physics model of coin tossing.</description>
