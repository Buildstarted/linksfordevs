      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210127-00/?p=104764</link>
      <description>A common variation on the basic autoscroll algorithm is to scroll faster the further the mouse moves away from the window. You can think of the mouse as tugging on the window via an imaginary rubber band, and the further away from the window you move the mouse,</description>

      <title>Adhering to Consent with Cookie Information for Episerver</title>
      <link>https://www.codeart.dk/blog/2021/1/adhering-to-consent-with-cookie-information-for-episerver/</link>
      <description>In the EU the past year has added even more rules and regulations to which cookies can be set, which data can be collected and which consents are needed for it. While it may not be tricky to add a basic consent box, adding one that adhere to all the proper legislation and then follow the consents given can be a bit more challenging.

      <title>Why a paid Twitter won&amp;#39;t work</title>

      <description>Twitter has bought a newsletter platform called Revue. Revue’s business model was provisions of paid newsletters and premium features. After the acquisition, the provision has now been lowered and the premium features made free.</description>

      <title>Federated development and federated forges – Lo&amp;#239;c Dachary</title>
      <link>https://blog.dachary.org/2021/01/23/federated-development-and-federated-forges/</link>
      <description>I’m very new federation. Over the years I heard rumors that it was good without understanding why and how. I ran a mastodon instance for a few years but did not use it much: I’m a developer and not much of a microblogger (reading or writing). Beginning of last year I started using https://peer.tube/ and was happy to see it work for real but did not use any of its federated features. But when https://joinmobilizon.org/ was announced I thought it made a lot of sense to organize events in a federated way: smart move. And all along I thought I should read about fediverse but I still have no idea what it means (really).</description>

      <title>The Spaghetti Code Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/01/26/spaghetti-code-conjecture.html</link>
      <description>Turing machine programs are sometimes represented as directed graphs. The vertices of the graph are the program’s states and the edges are transitions between states. The program’s print and shift instructions are relegated to being labels for the edges. Here’s an example:</description>

      <link>https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/production/working-fewer-hours-and-getting-more-done/</link>
      <description>At the start of December, I switched jobs to a new games company. While I really enjoyed being a lead programmer at my previous company, I found it difficult to combine both my leadership and programming responsibilities. I ended up feeling like I wasn’t doing my best work on either. My calendar often looked like Swiss cheese, with small meetings interspersed throughout my day. I’ve taken a step back on my leadership responsibilities now, so I can focus more on writing code.</description>

ENTSO-E has published the first information on the event already on 8 January 2021, followed by an update with geographical view and time sequence on 15 January 2021. Since then, ENTSO-E has analysed a large portion of relevant data aiming to reconstruct the event in detail.</description>
