      <title>Is BGP safe yet? Â· Cloudflare</title>
      <link>https://isbgpsafeyet.com/</link>
      <description>On the Internet, network devices exchange routes via a protocol called BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). Unfortunately, issues with BGP have led to malicious actors being able to hijack and misconfigure devices leading to security problems which have the potential to cause widespread problems. BGP security can be greatly improved by using technologies such as RPKI to sign Internet routes. This page attempts to track the progress of major Internet players (ISPs, transit operators, and content providers) in their progress to adopt RPKI and other technologies.</description>

      <title>How I made a basketball hoop that always goes in</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtN4tkvcBMA</link>
      <description>I've wondered if it is possible to make a basketball hoop where the ball always goes in. Imagine throwing a ball and if it hits the backboard it somehow gets directed into the hoop. Thanks to physics it isn't quite possible to make ALL possible shots go in though you can make a hoop where the ball goes in a lot more often. In this video I show how I wrote a program to calculate the optical backboard then machined and fabricated it. It worked out better than I was expected so I'm really happy with it!

*Sorry for the re-upload to anyone who saw the first one. I made a major rookie mistake and uploaded the wrong file. yikes! Lesson learned.*

      <description>We are happy to announce the preview of Uno Platform support for Visual Studio Code, following the progress made by the .NET team on the Visual Studio Code WebAssembly debugger integration. This blog will walk you through the set-up process for building and debugging WebAssembly apps with Uno wherever Visual Studio Code runs â€“ Windows, Linux or macOS. Also, it is important to note that by using Visual Studio Code, you will be able to create or edit only your Web (WebAssembly) Uno Platform projects. About Uno Platform For those new to Uno Platform â€“ it enables for creation of single-source C# and XAML apps which run natively on iOS and Android, and Web via WebAssembly. Uno Platform is Open Source (Apache 2.0) and available on GitHub. To learn more about Uno Platform, see how it works, or create a small sample app. Â  Create a new Uno Platform project for WebAssembly 1. Launch Code, then in the terminal type the following to install the Uno Platform templates: dotnet new -i Uno.ProjectTemplates.Dotnet::2.2.0-dev.494 Note that this command was updated since the original publication of this article.

      <link>https://msgpack.org/index.html</link>
