      <title>CSS Animation with offset-path</title>
      <link>https://yuanchuan.dev/css-animation-with-offset-path</link>
      <description>This is from last year when I tried to recreate Rach Smith's P5.js animation using CSS.
    The animation seemed like it could be implemented in a breeze, but there's an illusion of simplicity.
    The process of manually updating the positions and directions of each box was
    a bit tricky.</description>

      <title>On Product-Market Fit</title>
      <link>https://cra.mr/on-product-market-fit/</link>
      <description>One of the most difficult challenges I've faced in my career is figuring out product-market fit. I'd wager most of us have gotten there through sheer dumb luck. What do we do if we're not lucky, if we don't strike gold on our first try? I don't know if I have the answer. What I can do is try to break down what worked for Sentry's error monitoring - a reverse engineering of sorts - and reason about how we'd apply that to new products.</description>

      <title>Structure And Meaning</title>
      <link>https://shrsv.github.io/p/structure-and-meaning/</link>
      <description>“Up, down, up, down, up, down, …”
What comes next?
You know the answer - it is “Up”
How did you know it?
Your mind inferred some sort of structure, and made a guess
I mean - we do not know - what truly will come next.
But we are pretty sure - due to the repetition - and we expect it to be “up”.
There could be a breakage of pattern, but the fact that we expected an outcome - that hints at underlying structure.

      <title>OCaml’s Standard Library (Stdlib)</title>
      <link>https://batsov.com/articles/2025/03/14/ocaml-s-standard-library/</link>
      <description>Every programming language comes with some “batteries” included - mostly in the form of its standard library. That’s typically all of the functionality that’s available out-of-the-box, without the need to install additional libraries. (although the definition varies from language to language) Usually standard libraries are pretty similar, but I think that OCaml’s a bit “weird” and slightly surprising in some regards, so I decided to write down a few thoughts on it and how to make the best of it.</description>

      <title>How To Validate Email Addresses in C#? - Oli De Bastiani</title>
      <link>https://debastiani.net/Blog/how-to-validate-email-addresses-in-csharp</link>
      <description>Numerous applications rely on email addresses to recognize users. Since email addresses are unique, they serve as a reliable way of verifying the authenticity of a user. However, sending emails to incorrect addresses can result in errors. This is why the format of an email address is typically checked after it is entered. While some developers utilize RegEx for this purpose, is it truly the best practice?</description>

      <title>Does unsafe undermine Rust's guarantees?</title>
      <link>https://steveklabnik.com/writing/does-unsafe-undermine-rusts-guarantees/</link>
      <description>When people first hear about unsafe in Rust, they often have questions. A very
normal thing to ask is, “wait a minute, doesn’t this defeat the purpose?” And while
it’s a perfectly reasonable question, the answer is both straightforward and has a
lot of nuance. So let’s talk about it.</description>

      <title>.NET Aspire for Mobile Apps?!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=RCIM6qagZ-U</link>
      <description>You probably know about .NET Aspire by now and how great it is for web applications, containers and cloud apps. What if I told you that it can also be VERY useful for mobile app development? Insights in metrics, tracing those HTTP requests and no more fumbling with endpoint addresses? All possible with .NET Aspire!

In this video I will show you how to get started with .NET MAUI and .NET Aspire and how that can make your life a lot easier. I'd love to hear from you if this is something you would want to see supported and if and how its working for you if you decide to try it.

      <title>REST Constraint #2: Why Client-Server Separation is a Game Changer - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/rest-constraint-2-why-client-server-separation-is-a-game-changer/</link>
      <description>The internet as we know it thrives on separation—specifically, the separation of clients and servers. It’s a fundamental principle of REST and a key factor in building scalable, maintainable, and flexible applications. But what exactly does this separation mean, and why does it matter? Let’s dive into the Client-Server constraint, one of REST’s six core architectural principles.</description>

      <title>4 Learnings From Load Testing LLMs</title>
      <link>https://blog.christianposta.com/ai/learnings-from-load-testing-llms/</link>
      <description>The way LLMs run in Kubernetes is quite a bit different than running web apps or APIs. Recently I was digging into the benefits of the Inference Extensions for the Kubernetes Gateway API and I needed to generate some load for the backend LLMs I deployed (Llama, Qwen, etc). I ended up building an LLM load generation tool because I thought my use case needed some specific controls over how the test was run. In the end, I think about 90% of what I built was fairly generic for an LLM load test tool and I probably could have just tweaked the last 10% with an existing load tool to do what I needed. Nevertheless there were a few important things I learned about generating load against an LLM. Follow me (@christianposta /in/ceposta) for more thoughts on LLM perf as I will reslease some benchmarking results of running LLM inference workloads on GPUs in Kubernetes.

      <link>https://rafaelcamargo.com/blog/pushing-side-projects-forward-with-almost-no-free-time/</link>
      <description>I once heard a programmer call GitHub a graveyard for side projects. Felt kinda unfair to all the folks out there grinding away, making progress day in and day out. But I get it. Getting a project off the ground takes the ability to push forward with something that never seems to fit into your free time. In this post, I share the strategy I have been using to push my side projects forward.</description>

      <description>This post can be considered an advanced Zig tutorial. I will be covering some of the more unique
aspects of the language, but won't be explaining the easy part. If you haven't read the Zig
Language Reference, you might start there. Additionally,
we will also learn the foundational trick for implementing relational model.</description>

      <title>BEATCS interview - a3nm's blog</title>
      <link>https://a3nm.net/blog/beatcs_interview.html</link>
      <description>I tend to write a lot about my opinions about academia in my area (theoretical
computer science), e.g., about open access,
about general problems with academia, etc. If you are
interested in this topic, I just contributed an interview to the latest
Bulletin of the EATCS, the European scholarly
association for theoretical computer science (of which I am now a
vice-president).</description>

      <title>REST Constraint #1: The Power of a Uniform Interface - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/rest-constraint-1-the-power-of-a-uniform-interface/</link>
      <description>A well-designed REST API isn’t just a random collection of endpoints—it follows a set of principles that make it predictable, scalable, and easy to use. One of the core constraints of REST is the Uniform Interface. This principle ensures that APIs are structured consistently, reducing complexity for both developers and systems interacting with them.</description>

      <description>Blindspots in LLMs I’ve noticed while AI coding. Sonnet family emphasis. Maybe I will eventually suggest Cursor rules for these problems.</description>
