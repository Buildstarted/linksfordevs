      <title>Same App Different Design Patterns</title>
      <link>https://carltheperson.com/posts/same-app-different-design-patterns/</link>
      <description>Software design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems. They can be a huge advantage when designing software and can minimize the risk of your app turning into a huge mess. My idea for effectively learning different common design patterns was to create the same app multiple times using a different design pattern each time.</description>

      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Steve Collins to chat all about dependency injection in .NET. We (well, Steve!) demystified terms such as dependency inversion and inversion of control containers, and then delved into the world of dependency injection in .NET, covering scopes, and much more…

      <title>Migrate to ASP.NET Core MVC from ASP.NET Framework MVC</title>
      <link>https://www.josephguadagno.net/2021/05/19/migrate-to-asp-net-core-mvc-from-asp-net-mvc-framework</link>
      <description>.NET has been around for a while and has had many versions. We started the .NET Framework, moved into .NET Core, and now just .NET, kind of sort of :smile:. Keeping your application up with the latest version of .NET can be challenging. There are budgets to consider, time to learn the differences, and time to “fit in the migration.” Migrating or “upgrading” an ASP.NET MVC from .NET Framework to ASP.NET Core can be easy at times. Other times it can be just hard. There are no silver bullets to the migration as each project and solution is different. I’m going to walk you through one of the ways you can have a successful migration from ASP.NET MVC to ASP.NET Core MVC. At the end of the post, I’ll show you some gotchas that I have run across migrating applications.</description>
