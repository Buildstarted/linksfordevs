      <description>Speed up your ASP.NET Core applications and reduce server load with Response Caching! In this video, we break down what response caching is, why it's important, and how to use the [ResponseCache] attribute to control how your responses are cached on the client or by proxies.

You'll learn:
‚úÖThe real-world benefits of response caching üöÄ
‚úÖHow to use [ResponseCache] with Duration, Location
‚úÖHow to dynamically control caching based on user roles or headers
‚úÖBest practices and common pitfalls to avoid

Whether you're building APIs, MVC views, or high-traffic sites, caching is one of the easiest ways to gain massive performance wins.

      <description>When you do need thousands and tens of thousands of transactions per second, TigerBeetle is there for you. A few hundred per second you can do it yourself in ~25 lines of code. And you can reach thousands but it requires an understanding of databases and sometimes creative approaches.</description>

      <title>Mistakes and cool things to do with arena allocators</title>
      <link>https://zylinski.se/posts/dynamic-arrays-and-arenas/</link>
      <description>When programming in Odin you can use arena allocators. If you use an arena allocator combined with a dynamic array, then there are a couple of pitfalls that may not be apparent at first. Let‚Äôs look at what arenas are, how you can run into trouble when naively using them with dynamic arrays and what you can do instead.
What‚Äôs an arena? How does it work? Arenas and arena allocators are useful for grouping allocations that have the same lifetime.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs late afternoon and you‚Äôre vibe coding. You‚Äôve been editing different parts of your codebase, building your vision step by step. You pause sometimes to review, but mostly you‚Äôre moving forward to make it work. As your project grows, keeping track of everything becomes tricky. Code that worked perfectly yesterday suddenly breaks today, and you‚Äôre not sure why. You keep switching between files and conversations, losing your flow. There‚Äôs no clear picture of what‚Äôs happening, making you wonder if you‚Äôre making real progress.</description>

      <title>Optimizing memory usage with modern .NET features</title>
      <link>https://mijailovic.net/2025/04/10/memory-optimizations/</link>
      <description>After my service migrated
from .NET Framework to .NET 8 (and later to .NET 9), it felt like a whole new world had opened to me. All
the modern .NET features that I had only been reading about on the .NET Blog
were finally available to me. Armed with Microsoft‚Äôs continuous, fleet-wide performance profiler, I embarked on a journey
to find the places where my service was allocating the most memory and fix the unnecessary allocations by using the newly
available .NET APIs. In this blog post, I‚Äôll show you some common code patterns that can be found in .NET Framework code,
along with their modern, high-performance alternatives.</description>

      <description>I love the Pok√©mon games. When I was 9 years old, I got Pok√©mon Red and from there on I was hooked. I played every free minute on my Game Boy Advance. Years later, one feature I still find intriguing: Trading via Serial Cable. How does it work and could you spoof the response, so you can trade yourself any Pok√©mon you‚Äôd like?
The answer, of course, is yes! This is how it can be done. This post only covers Pok√©mon Red.</description>
