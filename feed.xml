      <title>Hallucination is Inevitable: An Innate Limitation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11817</link>
      <description>Hallucination has been widely recognized to be a significant drawback for large language models (LLMs). There have been many works that attempt to reduce the extent of hallucination. These efforts have mostly been empirical so far, which cannot answer the fundamental question whether it can be completely eliminated. In this paper, we formalize the problem and show that it is impossible to eliminate hallucination in LLMs. Specifically, we define a formal world where hallucination is defined as inconsistencies between a computable LLM and a computable ground truth function. By employing results from learning theory, we show that LLMs cannot learn all of the computable functions and will therefore always hallucinate. Since the formal world is a part of the real world which is much more complicated, hallucinations are also inevitable for real world LLMs. Furthermore, for real world LLMs constrained by provable time complexity, we describe the hallucination-prone tasks and empirically validate our claims. Finally, using the formal world framework, we discuss the possible mechanisms and efficacies of existing hallucination mitigators as well as the practical implications on the safe deployment of LLMs.</description>

      <description>If you maintain an open-source project in the range of 10k-200k lines of code, I strongly encourage you to add an ARCHITECTURE document next to README and CONTRIBUTING.
Before going into the details of why and how, I want to emphasize that this is not another docs are good, write more docs advice.
I am pretty sloppy about documentation, and, e.g., I often use just simplify as a commit message.
Nonetheless, I feel strongly about the issue, even to the point of pestering you :-)</description>

      <title>100x Faster Query in Aurora Postgres with a lower random_page_cost</title>
      <link>https://www.shayon.dev/post/2024/55/100x-faster-query-in-aurora-postgres-with-a-lower-random_page_cost/</link>
      <description>Imagine looking for a specific book in a library. Reading through books sequentially is like a sequential scan in a database, while jumping directly to the desired book is like a random access. The `random_page_cost` reflects the relative cost of random access compared to sequential access in the database. At a very high level.</description>

      <link>https://polar.sh/epogrebnyak/posts/justpath-to-explore-path-quickly</link>
      <description>I always get the feeling that nobody knows what a PATH is and at this point they are too afraid to ask. In those rare cases you want see what kind of a mess your PATH variable is, what tools can you use? Print to screen with bash, split by line, maybe sort for visibility, inspect specific set of folders. What is you wanted to do the same on Windows, do you have to remember which operating system has which separator on PATH? Also are there duplicates or non-existing directories on PATH?</description>

      <title>you should try a partner dance</title>
      <link>https://breadchris.com/blog/you-should-try-a-partner-dance/</link>
      <description>I have been going swing dancing at Century Ballroom every week since the start of the year. Swing is a partner dance that has leaders and followers. Before every song, it is customary for the leader, typically a guy, to ask a follower, usually a girl, to dance, and when the song ends, the leader finds another follower to dance with for the next song. For someone with social anxiety, this can be pretty intimidating.</description>

      <description>Some years ago, Matt Daniels [1] wrote a great article on who has the largest vocabulary in hip-hop. I thought it was brilliant: comparing Shakespeare to famous hip-hop artists. It got me thinking and gave me the inspiration of doing something similar with a genre I love: Power Metal. People …</description>
