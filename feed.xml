      <title>WinForms in a 64-Bit world - our strategy going forward - .NET Blog</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/winforms-designer-64-bit-path-forward/</link>
      <description>32-bit components can impose challenges for WinForms developers in a 64-bit Visual Studio environment, but there are options to solve this. Component modernization, migrating to .NET 6+ and a new option to use the out-of-process Designer for Framework are the key to a feasible way forward!</description>

      <title>Creating an E-Book OnBoarding screen in .NET MAUI</title>
      <link>https://askxammy.com/creating-an-e-book-onboarding-screen-in-net-maui/</link>
      <description>Hello! &amp;#128587;‍♀️ In this article, we&amp;#39;ll replicate an E-Book Onboarding UI, a design sourced from Dribbble. This piece will help you strengthen your skills in managing XAML in a quick and easy way. The most fun part is that you&amp;#39;ll learn to build it yourself! &amp;#128525;
Explanation Insights
&amp;#128466; Before diving in, here are some guidelines to enhance your experience while replicating the UI:
▪ Reference Image: Initially, you’ll encounter an image displaying the original UI. This image is segmented into blocks, mirroring how we’ll approach each design element.
▪ Design Blocks: Every block features a specific design element we’ll focus on. These elements are accentuated within a highlighted box.
▪ Code Annotations: Within the coding sections, lookout for comments stating, “Insert the following code here.” These comments signal that the upcoming code explanation corresponds directly to that marked location.




Let’s start!
Breaking Down the Original Design into Blocks
For clarity and a structured approach, I’ve segmented the original design into specific blocks. We’ll tackle each block in the sequence presented below:





Main structure
In this case, we want to keep the same colors for both light and dark mode, let’s start by adding a white background color to the ContentPage.







&amp;#128640; For those keen on making their applications adaptable to both light and dark themes, the article “Handling Light and Dark Mode With .NET MAUI” is a must-read.
Adding the main layout: Now we will see how to add the layout that will contain all the elements of this UI. In this case, we will use the Grid.







If you want to know more information about Grid, I invite you to read the articles working with GridLayout &amp;#160;and latest Grid structure.







Let&amp;#39;s start by developing the first step, which includes three elements: a main image, a title, and a blue decorative bar. We are going to add the code progressively. To know exactly where to insert it, reference the code block above marked &amp;lt;!-- Insert Step 1 code here --&amp;gt;.
Now let’s explore how to add each UI element:
&amp;#128313; Main image



&amp;#128313; Title

For the title we will use the default font. However, if you want to learn how to add external text fonts, I recommend the article “Adding Fonts in .NET MAUI”.

&amp;#128161; If you&amp;#39;re wondering about the idea of using an external font but are having trouble identifying the font name, don&amp;#39;t worry! WhatTheFont can help you. Just upload a screenshot of your UI and it will identify the source for you. &amp;#128526;



✍️ Have you noticed the presence of these characters ‘&amp;amp;#10;’ in the text? They serve a purpose. You can use them when you want to insert a line break in the text.
&amp;#128313; Blue bar
To conclude this first step, let&amp;#39;s add the blue bar found in our design. You can create it using BoxView or Line Shape. In this case, we will use the Line Shape.







Continuing with step two, we have three elements: a description for clarity, a skip option, and a rounded button. Let&amp;#39;s see how to add them to the code:
&amp;#128313; Description &amp;amp; skip

&amp;#128313; Rounded button
Creating a rounded button is easy! Just add the HeightRequest and WidthRequest properties with the same value, then add the CornerRadius property with a value that&amp;#39;s exactly half of the previous one. For more on circular buttons, check out the article “Easy way to create circle buttons”.




And our E-Book onboarding screen &amp;#160;is done! &amp;#160;

Thanks for reading! &amp;#128075; See you next time! &amp;#128154;&amp;#128149;

      <description>Let&amp;#39;s talk about a plague occurring in the world of IT cybersecurity, which, in my opinion, receives too little attention. The title of the article may seem like an oxymoron, but let&amp;#39;s see if that&amp;#39;s really the case. As an incentive, I&amp;#39;ll add that the topic concerns the data processed in the applications you use, including the confidential information of your company and your clients. It&amp;#39;s better if these data don&amp;#39;t leak, right?</description>

      <title>Navigating Development in a Hyper Growth Startup (Pt 2)</title>
      <link>https://annanay25.github.io/navigating-development-in-a-hyper-growth-startup-pt-2/</link>
      <description>In Pt.1, I explained that kind of growth I was lucky to witness in my first few years at Grafana. In this post, I’d love to highlight my observations on things that worked well for us. There’s a few things in here that we can do as an IC (Individual Contributor),
and a few at the bottom of this list that can be implemented by company leadership. So lets’ get into it.

      <title>Why is it so hard to link svg tags in HTML?</title>
      <link>https://blog.borrego.dev/entries/why_is_it_so_hard_to_link_svg_tags_in_html.html</link>
      <description>The year is 2024. We have language models that can code, shitty AI-generated content everywhere, and still no flying cars. But a problem that should be trivial to solve is surprisingly annoying: why is there no easy way to link the contents of an &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;svg&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; tag?</description>

      <title>Should you fine tune for JSON output?</title>
      <link>https://freeman.vc/notes/should-you-fine-tune-for-json-output</link>
      <description>JSON Schemas are a great format to structure outputs of LLMs. Their spec gives you wide latitude in specifying expected constraints (length, enum values, nested objects). Coupled with logit masking, schemas allow you to guarantee the format of your output so there&amp;#39;s no fiddling with unexpected values. It turns LLMs into building blocks with a clear API and makes them a lot more modular.</description>

      <title>How I fall asleep February 21, 2024 on Sepi&amp;#39;s blog</title>
      <link>https://sepi.me/post-8</link>
      <description>For a long time, I had trouble sleeping. I would lie in bed for hours, unable to sleep because my mind would start thinking about upsetting or negative things. These thoughts would make it even harder for me to fall asleep, as bad thoughts seemed stronger and more real than good ones. Whenever I fell into this trap of negative thinking, I found myself stuck in a cycle of trying and failing to sleep, all while dealing with these unpleasant thoughts.</description>
