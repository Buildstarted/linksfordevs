      <description>Engineers have a massive unique advantage in today's economy, one which very few are taking advantage of to build real wealth. That advantage is a high salary coupled with a stable job and a relatively stable industry. That advantage engineers have gets compounded when we factor in the lowest interest</description>

      <link>https://leowid.com/the-surprising-science-of-alpha-males-the-most-empathetic-member-of-the-group/</link>
      <description>As a teenager, I always thought that the term “alpha male” sounded cool and powerful and worthy of pursuit. What it meant to me from how mainstream culture communicated it to me was to be dominating, strong, talking over people, and generally being on top. When I reflected on this more over time, it quickly […]</description>

      <description>A meta post introducing my solutions to the fantastic excellent second edition of “Statistical Rethinking” by Richard McElreath, a.k.a. Statistical Rethinking². Also discusses strategies to keep up with the material, mostly meant for self-study groups.
 Background As detailed previously, I recently was part of a course centered around Bayesian modeling for the Icelandic COVID-19 pandemic.

      <description>When I started managing about a decade ago I was terrible for the reasons many founders are: I’m my own biggest critic. I have extremely high expectations for myself, and as a result have high expectations for others. The frustration of incompetence blinded me from seeing the problem for what it was.</description>

      <description>Society moves in waves.  It always starts with lots of separate things. Then they get bundled. After a while, more and more people start to realize that the bundled solution is too bloated and not specific enough for their needs. This is when an unbundling happens.

      <title>The Four Quadrants of Conformism</title>
      <link>http://paulgraham.com/conformism.html</link>
      <description>One of the most revealing ways to classify people is by the degree
and aggressiveness of their conformism. Imagine a Cartesian coordinate
system whose horizontal axis runs from conventional-minded on the
left to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axis
runs from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The
resulting four quadrants define four types of people. Starting in
the upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively
conventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively
independent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded.</description>

      <title>Considering Rust</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT-LUQgc7s&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description>The Rust programming language has become a serious contender in the space of "systems" programming languages, and has recently been adopted by many of the tech giants for "serious" projects. In response to this, more companies are now considering whether they too should add Rust to their tech stack. This talk hopes to help you make that decision. We go through how the language compares to many current alternatives and what the language has to offer, but also what it's primary drawbacks are and its long-term viability prospects.

      <title>ASP.NET Core 3, IIS and empty HTTP headers</title>
      <link>https://thomaslevesque.com/2020/07/23/aspnet-core-iis-and-empty-http-headers/</link>
      <description>HTTP headers are key/value pairs sent at the beginning of a request or response. According to the grammar in RFC 7230, a field could have an empty value. In practice, it probably doesn’t make much sense: semantically, a header with an empty value or the absence of that header are equivalent.
However, some client or server implementations actually require that a given header is present, even if it’s empty. For instance, the validation tests for WOPI (an HTTP-based protocol used to integrate Office for the Web with an application) require that the X-WOPI-Lock header is included in the response in certain situations, even if it’s empty (even though the spec says it can be omitted).</description>
