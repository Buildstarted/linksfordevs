      <title>Navigating a Mid-Career Tech Stack Shift - Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=HdrRATL9sEw</link>
      <description>You want to switch tech stacks, but you're panicking. All of that hard work goes completely down the drain. You start back at square one as a junior developer.

... Or do you? Let's discuss!

As with all livestreams, I'm looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.

      <description>Since November 2024, software has become approximately free to create. The AI revolution isn‚Äôt coming ‚Äî it‚Äôs here, upending our tacit assumptions about how organizations operate, what products should do, and who your customers will be tomorrow. If you‚Äôre selling software on the premise that it‚Äôs hard to build, you‚Äôre already behind.</description>

      <title>Building a CoAP application on Ariel OS</title>
      <link>https://christian.amsuess.com/blog/website/2025-03-27_ariel_coap/</link>
      <description>Ariel OS is an embedded operating system written in Rust,
whose first version 0.1. was released recently.
It is designed for "constrained devices" (a.k.a. "embedded devices" or "IoT devices"),
that is, electronic devices with little power and storage ‚Äì
think "what is in your remote control" and not "what is on your computer".
The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a networking protocol for the same group of devices.
It is similar to HTTP in its semantics,
but tuned to simple implementation and small messages that work over the most low-power networks.</description>

      <description>Spade is a new hardware description language which makes hardware
description easier and less error-prone. It does this by taking lessons from

hardware gets generated.</description>
