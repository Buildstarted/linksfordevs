      <description>I recently heard about a project where the code was written in C#, but where they implemented the unit tests in F#. They did so because they wanted to learn and evaluate F# in a protected environment. I thought that sounded like a very good idea and wanted to try.</description>

      <title>Questioning Probability</title>
      <link>https://justinmeiners.github.io/questioning-probability/</link>
      <description>A popular narrative explaining the outcome of the 2016 election is that the odds were in Clinton’s favor.
She just got unlucky.
That election night, dice were cast, and she unfortunately rolled snake eyes.
The comforting messages implied by this interpretation probably explains it’s popularity;
it was nobody’s fault,
we still have the popular ideas,
we don’t even have to change our strategy to win next time.
The alternatives are much harder to look at.
But, the critical, yet unquestioned assumption that this narrative
depends on is that elections are random events.
But how similar is winning election to winning roulette?</description>

      <title>Holy Post - Race in America - Part 2</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-yun74BJEc</link>
      <description>I got a lot of follow-up questions after my last video about race, so I&amp;#39;m answering the four that came up the most:

1.  &amp;quot;What about family breakdown and fatherlessness?&amp;quot; 
2.  &amp;quot;What about the welfare system?&amp;quot;
3.  &amp;quot;Why do you say WE did this??&amp;quot;
4.  And finally... &amp;quot;Okay, I CARE.  But what can I DO?&amp;quot;

So buckle up, friends!  It&amp;#39;s a bit long, but it&amp;#39;s WORTH it!</description>
