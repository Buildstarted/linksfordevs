      <title>Sneaky async void Leads to ASP.NET Core Crash</title>
      <link>https://joshthecoder.com/2023/12/01/sneaky-async-void-leads-to-aspnetcore-crash.html</link>
      <description>I had a production issue at work recently where an ASP.NET Core application would crash periodically. It was a fairly tricky issue because it appeared to be crashing due to an unhandled exception in a Controller method - which shouldn’t crash the app pool, it should be handled by ASP.NET Core and return an error to the browser. Setup To start, I’ll create a web API service with: dotnet new webapi --use-controllers -o CrashyApi Now I’ll create a class that has an HttpClient as a dependency: public class SpecialService { private readonly HttpClient _httpClient; public SpecialService(HttpClient httpClient) { _httpClient = httpClient; } } Then I’ll add the class to DI: builder.Services.AddTransient&amp;lt;SpecialService&amp;gt;(); Next, I’m going to configure an anonymous factory method that fills out the base address of the HttpClient from appsettings.json. This is to keep things simple in the class - calls can use relative URIs, rather than needing to specify the full target domain: builder.Services.AddHttpClient&amp;lt;SpecialService&amp;gt;((provider, client) =&amp;gt; { using var scope = provider.CreateScope(); var config = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService&amp;lt;IConfiguration&amp;gt;(); var baseUrl = config[&amp;quot;SpecialBaseUrl&amp;quot;]; if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(baseUrl)) return; client.BaseAddress = new Uri(baseUrl); }); That factory method will get called any time the DI container is asked to resolve an instance of the SpecialService class. Finally, I have a Controller endpoint that calls a method on my service, which just returns the configured base address (for simplicity’s sake): [ApiController] [Route(&amp;quot;[controller]&amp;quot;)] public class TestController : ControllerBase { private readonly SpecialService _specialService; public TestController(SpecialService specialService) { _specialService = specialService; } [HttpGet(Name = &amp;quot;GetBaseAddress&amp;quot;)] public string Get() { return _specialService.GetBaseAddress(); } } This works great, I can test it in the Swagger UI: Feature Change Now we have decided to get the base address from a DB instead of a configuration file. That’s an easy code change, in principle. We have EF Core, so we can resolve the context instead of the IConfiguration, and then query the DB. The updated factory code looks like this: builder.Services.AddHttpClient&amp;lt;SpecialService&amp;gt;(async (provider, client) =&amp;gt; { using var scope = provider.CreateScope(); using var context = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService&amp;lt;DefaultEFContext&amp;gt;(); var setting = await context.Settings.SingleAsync(s =&amp;gt; s.SettingName == &amp;quot;SpecialBaseUrl&amp;quot;); var baseUrl = setting.SettingValue; if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(baseUrl)) return; client.BaseAddress = new Uri(baseUrl); }); I’ll also make everything on the consuming side async, to more accurately match the real scenario: [HttpGet(Name = &amp;quot;GetBaseAddress&amp;quot;)] public async Task&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; Get() { return await _specialService.GetBaseAddressAsync(); } This also works fine! Swagger UI results look the same (I won’t bother repeating the screenshot). However, if the SQL Server is unavailable for any reason, that query in the factory method will throw an Exception (as one would expect). Something that’s not necessarily obvious from the code there is that the anonymous method is an async void method, which will crash the entire process (if you’re running in IIS, that’s the w3wp.exe process hosting the .NET application) in the face of an unhandled Exception. This is pretty bad news, as often a SQL Server error can be transient - especially running in the cloud, where flaky networks and slow disks abound. About async void Any unhandled Exception can crash a process. However, when working with ASP.NET Core, it’s easy to expect that normal user requests hitting controller endpoints are not vulnerable to this. The framework will eventually handle the Exception and return a 500 error response. An async void method violates this expectation, because it runs on a separate thread, and thus try-catch blocks in the calling code can’t catch Exceptions thrown from the method (the calling method has already moved on). This is explained in the documentation, as well as why a Task-returning method does work normally with Exception handling: The caller of a void-returning async method can’t catch exceptions thrown from the method. Such unhandled exceptions are likely to cause your application to fail. If a method that returns a Task or Task&amp;lt;TResult&amp;gt; throws an exception, the exception is stored in the returned task. The exception is rethrown when the task is awaited. Make sure that any async method that can produce an exception has a return type of Task or Task&amp;lt;TResult&amp;gt; and that calls to the method are awaited. Fixing You can avoid this problem by: wrapping the contents of the anonymous method in a try-catch block using the synchronous APIs instead, and removing the async-await from the anonymous method I went with the second approach, as there is really no need for that factory to be async - it was just made that way out of a habit of using the async EF Core APIs. Here’s the updated code: builder.Services.AddHttpClient&amp;lt;SpecialService&amp;gt;((provider, client) =&amp;gt; { using var scope = provider.CreateScope(); using var context = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService&amp;lt;DefaultEFContext&amp;gt;(); var setting = context.Settings.Single(s =&amp;gt; s.SettingName == &amp;quot;SpecialBaseUrl&amp;quot;); var baseUrl = setting.SettingValue; if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(baseUrl)) return; client.BaseAddress = new Uri(baseUrl); }); Now, if even if there is an issue contacting the SQL Server, the browser will just get a 500 error, which the application can handle (by allowing a retry, showing an error message, etc.): Summary Avoid async void like the plague. It’s confusing and awful. Be especially careful when using APIs that accept an Action as a parameter, as these are void-returning delegates, are easy to make async, and it’s not nearly as obvious that you need to deal with the caveats of async void when this comes up.</description>

      <title>AI and Trust - Schneier on Security</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/12/ai-and-trust.html</link>
      <description>I trusted a lot today. I trusted my phone to wake me on time. I trusted Uber to arrange a taxi for me, and the driver to get me to the airport safely. I trusted thousands of other drivers on the road not to ram my car on the way. At the airport, I trusted ticket agents and maintenance engineers and everyone else who keeps airlines operating. And the pilot of the plane I flew in. And thousands of other people at the airport and on the plane, any of which could have attacked me. And all the people that prepared and served my breakfast, and the entire food supply chain—any of them could have poisoned me. When I landed here, I trusted thousands more people: at the airport, on the road, in this building, in this room. And that was all before 10:30 this morning.</description>

      <title>Text Truncation and Wrapping in .NET MAUI</title>
      <link>https://askxammy.com/text-truncation-and-wrapping-in-net-maui/</link>
      <description>Imagine an app without text; it would be practically non-functional, wouldn&amp;#39;t it? &amp;#129335;‍♀️ Text is an essential element in any application, and handling it appropriately according to different requirements is very important. In this article, we will focus on techniques for truncating and wrapping text using the LineBreakMode property to enhance the readability of our text. Let&amp;#39;s get started! &amp;#128640;

Let’s start!
What is the LineBreakMode?
This property allows you to control the wrapping and truncation of the text. Accepts an enumeration as a value, which contains the following values:
➖ NoWrap
Its responsibility is to display only the text that fits on the device’s first line. This means the amount of text visible on the first line may vary depending on the size device. – [It’s the default value].



➖ WordWrap
These values automatically move text to the next line at the word boundary. This prevents words from being cut off at the end of a line, enhancing readability and allowing text to adapt to various screen sizes.



➖ CharacterWrap
Unlike the WordWrap function, this setting automatically transfers text to the next line based on a character limit. This sometimes results in line breaks that do not align with entire words.




➖ HeadTruncation
It omits the beginning of the text, presenting only the final part in a single line. It’s best used when the text’s conclusion is most relevant to the reader, ensuring focus on the most pertinent information.




➖ MiddleTruncation
Unify the beginning and end of the text to fit within a single line, replacing the middle section with an ellipsis, which consists of three dots (...)



➖ TailTruncation


It omits the end of the text, presenting only the initial part on a single line.








And our article is completed! &amp;#160;.
Thanks for ready! &amp;#128075; See you next time! &amp;#128154;&amp;#128149;

      <link>https://workdad.dev/posts/building-a-text-editor-the-gap-buffer/</link>
      <description>Prologue: The Agon 8-bit computer In December of 2022 I came across a new 8-bit computer called Agon. It was built around the eZ80 CPU, a modern version of the venerable Z80 processor that was popular in many 1980s microcomputers, and an ESP32 microcontroller for video generation using FabGL (now vdp-gl, a fork of FabGL maintained by me). The original Z80 was an 8 bit CPU with a 16 bit address bus, allowing it to access up to 64KiB of memory at a time.</description>

      <title>AI and Mass Spying - Schneier on Security</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/12/ai-and-mass-spying.html</link>
      <description>Spying and surveillance are different but related things. If I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what you did.</description>

I can finally reveal some research I&amp;#39;ve been involved with over the past year or so.

We (@redford@infosec.exchange, @mrtick@infosec.exchange and I) have reverse engineered the PLC code of NEWAG Impuls EMUs. These trains were locking up for arbitrary reasons after being serviced at third-party workshops. The manufacturer argued that this was because of malpractice by these workshops, and that they should be serviced by them instead of third parties.

      <title>Inline Snapshot testing in .NET - G&amp;#233;rald Barr&amp;#233;</title>
      <link>https://www.meziantou.net/inline-snapshot-testing-in-dotnet.htm</link>
      <description>In this post, I describe how to use Inline Snapshot testing in .NET. Inline Snapshot testing is a technique that allows you to write tests that assert the output of a method or function. The output is stored in a snapshot file. The next time the test is run, the output is compared to the snapshot file. If the output is different, the test fails. If the output is the same, the test passes.&amp;quot;
