      <title>Vibe Coding: Building Code Commute With Agents - Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=VZ5lO5jihRo</link>
      <description>Vibe coding and agents are all the rage! My most recent experience was quite lackluster with AI agents... but let's see if we can build the landing page for Code Commute in Blazor and Aspire using agents!

As with all livestreams, I'm looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.

      <title>Foreground segmentation with JBIG2 for improved PDF compression: pdf-segmented</title>
      <link>https://yingtongli.me/blog/2025/05/09/pdf-segmented.html</link>
      <description>JBIG2 is an efficient image compression format for bi-level (bi-tonal) images, which is supported by the PDF file format and common PDF viewers. To date, tooling for producing documents using JBIG2 (particularly open source tooling) has been limited; I have previously presented file-jbig2pdf, a GIMP plugin for generating PDF files using JBIG2. This suffices for simple black-and-white documents, but does not assist when documents contain both black-and-white text and colour graphics.</description>

      <description>After days of debugging unexplained span usage in Sentry - despite an ultra-low sampling rate - I discovered `traceparent` headers in requests traced back to OpenAI. Turns out, it's always AI.</description>

      <title>Transactions as Transformers</title>
      <link>https://will62794.github.io/databases/transactions/isolation/2025/05/04/transformers-not-transactions.html</link>
      <description>Database transactions are traditionally modeled as a sequence of read/write operations on a set of keys, where each read operation returns some value and each write sets a key to some value. This is reflected in most of the formalisms that define various transactional isolation semantics (Adya, Crooks, etc.).</description>

      <link>https://brianredbeard.com/blog/ive_been_here_the_whole_time/</link>
      <description>A key inspiration for this post is Sam Reich, who lives in my general neighborhood.
Reich has spent seven seasons of the show "Game Changer" (Wikipedia) reminding everyone of a single crucial detail:
Sam: thanks for the reminder that there's always some troll hanging out. üòÖ The current tech climate often focuses on uncovering vulnerabilities. So, in that spirit, let's dive in.
And so this tale will surely end well, won't it?</description>
