      <title>The Future of Senior Developers in an AI-Driven World</title>
      <link>https://christianheilmann.com/2023/04/02/the-future-of-senior-developers-in-an-ai-driven-world/</link>
      <description>As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, many are concerned about its impact on the job market, particularly for junior developers. If AI can automate many of the tasks these developers currently perform, how will we have new senior developers and architects in the future? Let’s talk about how junior developers still have crucial roles to play, and why the potential automation of their tasks doesn’t necessarily mean a lack of future senior developers and architects.</description>

      <link>https://blog.scottlogic.com/2023/03/31/the-new-ai-platform.html</link>
      <description>The buzz and excitement around generative AI is continuing to grow as their capabilities rapidly expand. However, their ability to generate content is just the starting point. From my perspective, the emergent reasoning capability, coupled with their intelligent use of tools, is what will make this technology truly transformational, and will mark the start of a new technology epoch.</description>

      <description>In C# and .NET land, we’re pretty heavy on the code first approaches, with the odd exception. Let’s take a look at a possible contract first approach to API development, with OpenAPI, but still taking advantage of existing tooling that we’ve come to rely on, like Swagger UI.</description>

      <link>https://josh.blog/2023/04/hush-wkwebview</link>
      <description>If you’re building an iOS app with webviews, you need to decide whether to use WKWebView or SFSafariViewController. The WebView version gives you a lot more control, but you can’t use Safari Extensions. On the other hand, the Safari version automatically gets some of the features of Safari like content blocking extensions, but customization options are pretty limited and it doesn’t support loading local HTML files.</description>
