      <title>Microsoft Testing Platform is cool!</title>
      <link>https://blog.ostebaronen.dk/2025/07/ms-test-platform-is-cool.html</link>

With xUnit v3 the possibility of running the tests was added without the need of using any other external tools like console runners, dotnet test or VSTest. So a xUnit test suite is just a executable itself. Not long after xUnit v3 were released I discovered Microsoft Testing Platform, which achieves something very similar. According to their own docs it “[..]is a lightweight and portable alternative to VSTest for running tests in all contexts”.</description>
