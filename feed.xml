      <title>Solving Super Six</title>
      <link>https://ashdnazg.github.io/articles/24/Solving-Super-Six</link>
      <description>Super Six (a.k.a Rio and plenty of other names) is not a good game, it’s repetitive, heavily luck dependent, and repetitive. Nevertheless, it has two major qualities - it’s short and simple. These qualities translate into a much more interesting one - it’s solvable for two players! While the game itself is a mediocre subject for a blog post, the maths behind solving it are not only interesting themselves, but they can also be used to solve other two-player games.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Model in LLVM - Part I</title>
      <link>https://myhsu.xyz/llvm-sched-model-1/</link>
      <description>Instruction scheduling is essential to modern compilers. It tries to hide latencies and increases the throughput of a straight line code by reordering the enclosing instructions. In order to do that, compilers have to know a whole bunch of information, ranging from individal instruction’s latency to microarchitecture details. The system that describes these is called a scheduling model. In LLVM, a scheduling model is used by not just the instruction scheduler, but also target-specific optimizations like MachineCombiner and components like MCA (Machine Code Analyzer)1.</description>

      <link>https://viewfromthewing.com/airlines-are-running-out-of-flight-numbers-and-they-dont-know-what-to-do-about-it/</link>
      <description>Airlines use up to four digits for flight numbers. That means they can have up to 9,999 flights (since there’s no flight zero), and no one comes close. American Airlines operates around 6,700 daily flights including its American Eagle regional services. So they should have plenty of room to grow!  Except they don’t. American Airlines, Delta, and United are running out of flight numbers, and nobody knows what to do about it.</description>

      <description>Password management is a hassle, but worse is using the same password or a very similar one across all accounts. Eventually, regrets come when we fall victim to hacking. Unfortunately, my trust in password managers like LastPass or 1Password is zero. Just remember the LastPass hack, where a multitude of passwords were decrypted.
The LastPass Hack In the attack on LastPass, hackers used phishing techniques and compromised users’ personal and administrative data.</description>
