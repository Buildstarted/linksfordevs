      <title>Thoughts on chess improvement, after gaining 600 points in 6 months (1200-1800)</title>
      <link>https://mbuffett.com/posts/chess_improvement_thoughts/</link>
      <description>For some background: I played chess briefly with my friends in high school, where I had a rating of around 1100 online. I gave up the game for about 10 years, then picked it back up again recently, in May. I’ve tried a ton of different approaches in the past 6 months, switching things up whenever I stopped seeing results. I’ve improved from 1238 to 1802, and based on my win rate currently I think I’ve got another 50 points in me before I plateau again.</description>
