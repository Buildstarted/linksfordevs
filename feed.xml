      <title>Mentoring junior engineers in the age of coding agents</title>
      <link>https://blog.marcua.net/2025/07/21/mentoring-junior-engineers-in-the-age-of-coding-agents.html</link>
      <description>A decent amount of digital ink has been spilled about the future of software engineering in light of increasingly powerful coding agents. Will software engineers, especially junior ones, be able to find jobs in the future as coding agents become more powerful? I’m not a futurist, so I’ll make some observations informed by my own increasingly productive use of coding agents like Claude Code and Aider: Today’s best coding agents still very much require a human operator, To effectively use these coding agents in a professional context, you have to make some big changes to how you work, and There are many elements of professional software engineering that coding agents don’t meaningfully enhance.</description>

      <description>Over the past few years I’ve talked to a number of people who are interested in getting into the technical writing field. After years of meaning to do this, I finally took some time to write up the thoughts and resources I typically share with people looking to get into the field. This is far from a comprehensive guide and notably doesn’t include much specific resume or cover letter advice.</description>
