      <title>Why does an extraneous build step make my Zig app 10x faster?</title>
      <link>https://mtlynch.io/zig-extraneous-build/</link>
      <description>
    
      For the past few months, I’ve been curious about two technologies: the Zig programming language and Ethereum cryptocurrency. To learn more about both, I’ve been using Zig to write a bytecode interpreter for the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
Zig is a great language for performance optimization, as it gives you fine-grained control over memory and control flow. To motivate myself, I’ve been benchmarking my Ethereum implementation against the official Go implementation.

      <title>Execution is King</title>
      <link>https://n9o.xyz/posts/202403-execution-is-king/</link>
      <description>As a Product Manager, more often than not, I notice people mixing up _ideas_ and _execution_ in discussions. Both these concepts have entirely unique levels of fidelity to what the finished product will be. It’s important for Product Managers to know the difference between these two concepts, how to manage them, and what importance they should have at different stages of the product development cycle. Not understanding the differences between an _idea_ and an _execution_ isn&amp;#39;t just a minor inconvenience; it&amp;#39;s a significant obstacle to innovation and strategic execution for products and companies. </description>

      <description>One of my favorite features in Neovim is the Tree-sitter integration.
It allows for fast syntax highlighting that works well even in an error state (often the case when you’re editing code), and it has additional semantics (you can differentiate between function parameters and local variables).</description>
