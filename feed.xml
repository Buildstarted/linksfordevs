      <description>In  the latest Numberphile video , Marcus du Sautoy introduced me to the notion of n+7 writing/poetry.  Take an existing text, and replace the nouns with words   seven places advanced in the dictionary  .  I decided to apply this treatment to the most famous Star Wars crawl, from episode IV.

      <title>The Pareto PM - Jon Douglas</title>
      <link>https://jondouglas.dev/the-pareto-pm/</link>
      <description>As I reflect upon the last 5 years, one of the biggest themes that sticks out is whether a PM is thinking in outputs or outcomes.An early in career PM may be thinking purely in outputs. How many features can we build? How many bugs can we fix in this release? How many interviews should I do? And so on.Later in career PM tend to think in outcomes. What features will bring the most impact this year? What bugs will solve most of our user’s issues? What type of interviews will bring answers our teams need? This is what I can best define as a “Pareto PM”. For those unfamiliar, the pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule simply states that 80% of the outcomes come from 20% of the causes.</description>

      <title>Setup mypy for fun and profit</title>
      <link>https://muscaw.dev/2022/05/01/setup-mypy-for-fun-and-profit/</link>
      <description>Have you ever written Python code and had to dig deep into callstacks to understand what the return type of a function is?
I know I did and unfortunately, it makes me slower overall because I always have to dig through the callstack to understand what I’m dealing with. This also makes the code sensibly more complex given the number of additional checks that need to be implemented to assert a returned value is of an expected type.</description>

      <title>making friends on the internet</title>
      <link>https://jon.bo/posts/making-friends-online/</link>
      <description>There are almost eight billion of us on this planet, ten thousand likely very similar to yourself. The Internet is a typical person’s best hope for finding and connecting with them.
Mount Sanitas Summit west, Boulder, CO  I enjoy life in large part thanks to friends I made on the internet. These friendships have led to jobs, romantic adventures, stays in dreamy oceanside villas, global hackathons, and countless transformative and wonderful experiences.</description>

      <description>At my company we use a small SQLite database. We define the schema in a single file with SQL CREATE TABLE statements. If we add tables, columns, or indexes, our application will create them automatically the next time it starts up.</description>

      <title>Your computer has two clocks</title>
      <link>https://notes.lourenci.com/your-computer-has-two-clocks/</link>
      <description>You cannot realise that, but your computer has a battery inside it only to get your computer clock running. Back in the 90s, when the rechargeable (lithium-ion) battery was not cheap, we used to disassemble our computers to replace their clock battery when the computer could not keep the clock “on time” anymore. Yeah, your computer clock is a “thing”.</description>
