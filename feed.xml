      <title>Chromium Ozone/Wayland: The Last Mile Stretch</title>
      <link>https://nickdiego.dev/blog/chromium-ozone-wayland-the-last-mile-stretch/</link>
      <description>Hey there! I’m glad to finally start paying my blogging debt :) as this is something I’ve been planning to do for quite some time now. To get the ball rolling, I’ve shared some bits about me in my very first blog post Ol&amp;#225; Mundo.
In this article, I’m going to walk through what we’ve been working on since last year in the Chromium Ozone/Wayland project, on which I’ve been involved (directly or indirectly) since I’ve joined Igalia back in 2018.</description>

      <title>The Tests You SHOULD Be Writing In Event-Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=Sbh9by6GqvY</link>
      <description>Hi, I&amp;#39;m James. And in this video you&amp;#39;ll learn all about the types of tests you should be writing when building an event-driven system. Specifically, schema and contract tests.

As a producer in an event-driven system, one of your main responsibilities is to not make breaking changes. Which raises the question, why can&amp;#39;t you test for that? In this video you&amp;#39;ll see a strategy you can use in your .NET applications to make sure you never make a breaking change again.

00:00 - Introduction
01:24 - The Problem
02:10 - Schema &amp;amp; Contract Testing
03:05 - Writing Schema &amp;amp; Contract Tests
04:11 - Generating The Event
05:15 - Test The Event Is Generated
05:45 - Validating JSON schemas
06:40 - Schema Tests in Action

      <title>Kill the Bloat: The Controversial Clash Between SPAs, Server-Side Rendering, and the Power of Simplicity - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/kill-the-bloat-the-controversial-clash-between-spas-server-side-rendering-and-the-power-of-simplicity/</link>
      <description>Ever feel like half your development time goes to chasing down strange bugs in a colossal JavaScript stack that only a wizard could appreciate? You’re not alone. In the realm of web apps, we’re always trying to determine whether it’s better to handle everything on the server or shift as much as possible to the browser. This discussion isn’t just about technology—it’s about maintaining manageable code, keeping our sanity intact, and ensuring our users are happy. Enter the Simplicity-First philosophy, which reminds us that while fancy frameworks and cutting-edge libraries are appealing, they become useless if they overwhelm our code with excessive complexity. Simplicity-First is the sidekick that shows up with a utility belt full of best practices: naming things well, writing readable functions, and structuring elements so that future you (or your teammates) don’t have to pull out their hair. Buckle up as we embark on a journey through the history of server-side vs. client-side, explore why understanding your domain is crucial, and discover how new tools like htmx or server-first frameworks might bring peace to the galaxy.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#39;ve ever hardcoded values in Terraform, I have some bad news… and some great news! The bad news? Hardcoding is a one-way ticket to frustration and messy code. The great news? Terraform variables and outputs can save your sanity by making your infrastructure code dynamic, reusable, and scalable.</description>

      <title>Building a SUBSTANTIAL app with GitHub Copilot Agent mode - This is &amp;#129327;!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=pUK7MRzoTDc</link>
      <description>Agent mode is here in GitHub Copilot in VS Code and I want to give it a spin to see if it can help me build a full application from scratch. GitHub Copilot’s new agent mode is capable of iterating on its own code, recognizing errors, and fixing them automatically. It can suggest terminal commands and ask you to execute them. Copilot will iterate on not just its own output, but the result of that output. So, let&amp;#39;s give it a try and build a .NET MAUI application with a SQLite database, MVVM, navigation, and a lot more!

Agent Mode: https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/
App Code: https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/app-coffeetracker
GitHub Copilot Free: https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2024/12/18/free-github-copilot

Chapters:
00:00 - Intro &amp;amp; Agent Mode Setup
02:34 - Creating our base .NET MAUI application
07:10 - Cleaning up the user interface
09:00 - Adding new features to the app
10:30 - Refactoring with MVVM and .NET Community Toolkit
13:15 - Adding new pages and navigation
17:00 - Adding Grouping to our Data
20:00 - Adding Graphs and Charts
23:25 - Wrap-up and final thoughts
