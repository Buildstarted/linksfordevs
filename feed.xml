      <description>Jeff Fritz is joining the podcast today! This is his second guest appearance. He&amp;amp;nbsp; is an experienced developer, technical educator and PM on the .NET team at Microsoft. He founded The Live Coders team on Twitch, and regularly livestreams builds of websites and fun applications. You can follow Jeff for more .NET, .NET Core and Visual Studio content on Twitch and Twitter at @csharpfritz. &amp;amp;nbsp; In this episode, Jeff talks about what you’re missing out when it comes to Blazor web assembly and Blazor server side. Jeff has been getting a lot of skeptical comments lately on whether this .net application is ready for the real deal, and he shares his opinions for what it&amp;#39;s most useful for. He also has a live project that you can check out and beta test! Listen in as Jeff talks deployment and the future of where this application is headed.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:38] Be sure to visit  for past episodes and show notes.

Let’s give Blazor some breathing room to see how it matures.&amp;amp;nbsp; [11:20] Jeff shares some of the fun things he’s been doing with Blazor.&amp;amp;nbsp; P12:55] What’s the difference between the web assembly version vs. the server version, and when should you be using which?&amp;amp;nbsp; [14:40] What makes Blazor different from other .Net apps?&amp;amp;nbsp; [18:05] How do successfully connect and deploy this application? [24:00] A word from Azure DevOps Podcast’s sponsor: Clear Measure. [24:40] Do we need to be thinking about containers when it comes to Blazor? Jeff argues it’s even simpler than that.&amp;amp;nbsp; [27:05] Jeff breaks down the compatibility level of Blazor web assembly.&amp;amp;nbsp; [28:05] Blazor web assembly not compatible with your particular use case? You can convert it on server side for more flexibility.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; [29:35] Jeff shares some of the projects he’s currently working on.&amp;amp;nbsp; [33:05] Listener challenge! Test out Jeff’s project.&amp;amp;nbsp; [37:30] We have a whole generation of web developers that have grown up on ‘web for everything’.

      <title>Brave Browser leaks your Tor / Onion service requests through DNS.</title>
      <link>https://ramble.pw/f/privacy/2387/brave-browser-leaks-your-tor-onion-service-requests-through</link>
      <description>Edit: (Since this is gaining traction elsewhere.) I&amp;#39;m not trying to shit on Brave. I&amp;#39;m just wanting to help protect end-users who may use Brave for it&amp;#39;s Tor feature to do stuff over Tor that should only be done with the actual Tor browser. If you&amp;#39;re using Brave you probably use it because you expect a certain level of privacy/anonymity. Piping .onion requests through DNS where your ISP or DNS provider can see that you made a request for an .onion site defeats that purpose.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;#39;s be honest, silence is not usually considered an exciting subject. Despite Depeche Mode&amp;#39;s ironic effort to convince us, the idea that we should enjoy silence seems like a stretch. So why am I writing about it?</description>
