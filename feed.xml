      <link>https://mobukamal.com/caution-toxicity/</link>
      <description>There are certain words out there that you usually come across on the web more and not so much in real life. For an obvious example - lol (okay, there are people that actually say it out loud rather than laughing out loud lol).
Toxicity is one of them.

      <title>Devin Prater&amp;#39;s blog - Google: Full Speed Ahead</title>
      <link>https://devinprater.micro.blog/2023/01/13/google-full-speed.html</link>
      <description>For years now, Google has been seen, for good reasons I’d say, as moving very slowly with accessibility. TalkBack would get updates in fits and starts, but otherwise didn’t seem to have people that could devote much time to it. Starting a few years ago with multi-finger gestures, TalkBack development began picking up steam, and to my surprise and delight and relief, it has not slowed down. They seem to spend as much time resolving issues as they spend creating new features and experiences. This was highlighted in the new TalkBack update that began rollout on January 9.</description>

      <title>Why Aren’t We Refactoring Yet?</title>
      <link>https://kohack.github.io/why-arent-we-refactoring-yet/</link>
      <description>While most programmers are seemingly eager to write new code, few are eager to refactor.  In this blog post, I’ll briefly discuss a few salient reasons why I think some programmers appear to be less motivated to do code refactoring work.</description>
