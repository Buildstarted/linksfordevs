      <description>I guess you have all heard about the growing problem of AI companies trying to aggressively collect whatever data they can get their hands on to train their models.

      <title>The Icelandic voting system</title>
      <link>https://smarimccarthy.is/posts/2024-11-25-voting-system/</link>
      <description>It‚Äôs election season here in Iceland! The election is on Saturday, 30th of November, so next Saturday from when this is written.
Every time elections are upcoming, somebody inevitably asks me how the voting system here works, probably expecting a simple answer. So, here‚Äôs a stab at it.
Iceland uses a biproportional apportionment system, as do Norway, some cantons of Switzerland, some German regions, and a few other places. Such systems have a few general features:</description>

      <title>WarRoom / Technology // OpenAI o3/o4-mini Models Exhibit Hallucinations and Geolocation Prowess</title>
      <link>https://thewarroom.news/cluster/2859</link>
      <description>OpenAI has recently introduced its new o3 and o4-mini AI models that are integrated into ChatGPT. Reports indicate these models not only hallucinate more often than previous versions but also demonstrate an uncanny ability to determine photo locations. This duality of increased factual errors alongside unexpected geolocation proficiency has raised concerns among users and experts regarding model reliability and potential privacy implications. The coverage highlights both the technical achievements and challenges of incorporating these advanced AI capabilities.</description>

      <description>Rounding to 0% is bad because the user may think there's been no progress. Rounding to 100% is bad because the user may think things are done when they aren't.</description>

      <description>Imagine walking into a shoe store and asking for size 10 sneakers. You may end up with shoes that fit, but ‚Äúsize 10‚Äù isn‚Äôt descriptive enough to be sure ‚Äî the US, UK, EU, Australia, and Japan all have different shoe sizing systems. To ensure you get shoes that fit, it‚Äôd be wise to be more specific and ask for ‚Äúsize 10 US‚Äù or ‚Äúsize 10 EU‚Äù.</description>
