      <title>Terry Lambert&amp;#39;s answer to What’s your opinion about macOS Big Sur?</title>
      <link>https://www.quora.com/What-s-your-opinion-about-macOS-Big-Sur/answer/Terry-Lambert?ch=2&amp;srid=povO</link>
      <description>From what I’ve seen of the beta, they’ve taken precisely the wrong approach, in forcing third party drivers out of the kernel and into user space. Obviously their point in doing this was to ensure driver portability between x86 and ARM; what they’ve done, instead, given the development model for most peripheral companies that need device drivers for their devices to be usable on an OS, is orphan all existing hardware of that class. Probably uo are going to have to be buying a new printer, in particular, because once they are working, like cell phone manufacturers oof Android phones, there is never an update to the driver. The hardware device companies have very limited software engineering resources, and they will put them to the next device — like the next model of printer — and totally “screw anyone” who is no longer giving them money, because It’s All About The Benjamins™. They did this in the switch to PPC, and they did it again in the switch from PPC to Intel. It means having to re-buy perfectly good peripheral hardware, because no one will write a driver for it for the new architecture. Apple is wrong about the “if the driver is in user space, the manufacturer will surely just recompile!”. They won’t. It doesn’t sell new devices for them, and for loss-leader products like printers, it doesn’t sell more ink cartridges on the older printers where the DRM has been broken, and most ink cartridges are now purchased from third parties, rather than the manufacturer of the printer. Note: It was in fact entirely possible to run third party kernel drivers in such a way that they believed they were running in kernel space, but run them under Rosetta. Apple simply fell down on the job here. Again.</description>

      <title>How to create a QR Code generator with Azure Functions</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/create-qr-code-generator-azure-function/</link>
      <description>This post is about creating a QR Code generator using Azure Functions. A QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) first designed in 1994 for the automotive industry in Japan. QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application. I will be using a library - QRCoder to generate the QR Code for a URL. So first I have created a function with Http Trigger.</description>

      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Nov/25/Watch-out-for-NET-Core-Runtime-Bitness-for-IIS-Installs</link>

Here&amp;#39;s more detail on what the failure looks like and how to properly install .NET Core 5.0. </description>
