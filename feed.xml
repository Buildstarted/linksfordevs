      <title>SSH PKI on top of Web PKI</title>
      <link>https://paul.totterman.name/posts/ssh-pki-web-pki/</link>
      <description>Reading Future Internet PKI schemes need to be bootstrapped through web
PKI I was
reminded by all the problems I’ve had with SSH (Secure SHell) PKI (Public Key
Infrastructure). SSH host verification is trust-on-first-use (TOFU). So SSH is
protected from man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks unless the first connection
falls prey to the attack.</description>

      <description>tl;dr I believe that the best way to achieve as much as possible is to multi-task. But it has to be done properly.

      <description>This December I once again did the Advent of Code,
in Rust. If you are interested, my solutions
are on Github. I wanted to highlight one particular solution to the day 2
problem as it is both optimized completely
beyond the point of reason yet contains a useful technique. For simplicity we’re
only going to do part 1 of the day 2 problem here, but the exact same techniques
apply to part 2.</description>

      <title>Daily Driving a Smartphone Without Screen</title>
      <link>https://reggie.re/20230303-daily-driving-a-smartphone-without-screen.html</link>
      <description>Last year my phone’s screen broke in a way, that made it
                register inputs even if nothing was touching it. Any reasonable
                person would simply get a new phone, but I am not reasonable
                and also didn’t have any spare cash back then. So here is
                a short post about how I used my phone without a screen for
                around a month.</description>
