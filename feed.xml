      <title>Non-determinism in GPT-4 is caused by Sparse MoE</title>
      <link>https://152334h.github.io/blog/non-determinism-in-gpt-4/</link>
      <description>It’s well-known at this point that GPT-4/GPT-3.5-turbo is non-deterministic, even at temperature=0.0. This is an odd behavior if you’re used to dense decoder-only models, where temp=0 should imply greedy sampling which should imply full determinism, because the logits for the next token should be a pure function of the input sequence &amp;amp; the model weights.</description>

      <title>Modular Monolith Communication Patterns</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/modular-monolith-communication-patterns</link>
      <description> Modular monoliths are becoming more popular in the software engineering community.
The allure of Microservices is becoming less compelling. We also have seasoned veterans of our industry saying you should reconsider:
&amp;gt; You shouldn&amp;#39;t start a new project with microservices, even if you&amp;#39;re sure your application will be big enough to make it worthwhile.
— Martin Fowler
Modular monoliths give you the logical architecture of Microservices without the operational complexity. You can safely determine the boundaries between modules. And refactoring is straightforward and less risky. They can also be easily migrated into Microservices if you decide to do so.
I&amp;#39;ve built and maintained several Modular monolith systems in the past years.
In this week&amp;#39;s newsletter, I want to focus on the communication patterns in the Modular monolith architecture.
But first, let me explain what is a Modular monolith.</description>

      <link>https://sthbrx.github.io/blog/2023/08/04/quirks-of-parsing-ssh-configs/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been using the VSCodium 
Open Remote - SSH
extension recently to great results. I can treat everything as a single
environment, without any worry about syncing between my local development files
and the remote. This is very different to mounting the remote as a network drive
and opening a local instance of VSCodium on it: in addition to crippling latency
on every action, a locally mounted drive doesn&amp;#39;t bring the build context that
tools like clangd require (e.g., system headers).</description>
