      <link>https://woodruff.dev/exploring-programming-paradigms-c-and-rust-side-by-side/</link>
      <description>When it comes to programming languages, each has its quirks, strengths, and unique ways of looking at the world. Think of them as different superheroes with distinct powers. C# is your reliable, well-rounded champion of object-oriented programming (OOP), while Rust is the fearless defender of memory safety and performance.

      <title>PostgreSQL index creation in production systems</title>
      <link>https://purushotham.me/posts/postgresql-index-management-in-production/</link>
      <description>Introduction Managing indexes in a PostgreSQL database, especially in production environments, is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and ensuring data integrity. Indexes can significantly speed up query performance by allowing the database to quickly locate and access the data. However, creating and managing indexes in a live production system requires careful planning to avoid locking issues and performance degradation.</description>

      <description>Vector Databases: A Traditional Database Developer’s Perspective As a traditional database developer with machine learning platform experience from my time at Shopee, I’ve recently been exploring vector databases, particularly Pinecone. Rather than providing a comprehensive technical evaluation, I want to share my thoughts on why vector databases are gaining significant attention and substantial valuations in the funding market.
Demystifying Vector Databases At its core, a vector database primarily solves similarity search problems.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, a download link for a leak of configuration files for Fortigate/Fortinet devices was posted on an Internet forum. It appears that the data was collected in 2022 due to a security vulnerability known as CVE-2022-40684. According to a blog post by Fortinet in 2022, they were already aware of active exploitation of the issue back then. It was first reported by heise, a post by Kevin Beaumont contains further info.</description>
