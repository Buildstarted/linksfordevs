      <title>Exploring the ProgressBar in .NET MAUI</title>
      <link>https://askxammy.com/exploring-the-progressbar-in-net-maui/</link>
      <description>When performing an operation that takes time, it&amp;#39;s crucial to inform users that a process is ongoing and that they need to wait before taking further action. Progress indicators are a good option to achieve this, as they visually show the percentage of progress that a process takes. In this article, we will learn how to use them in .NET MAUI.




Let&amp;#39;s start!
What is a ProgressBar?
It&amp;#39;s a bar control that shows the progress of a process that is running. It is important to note that the appearance of the control may vary depending on the platform.




Exploring the properties
This control is defined by the following properties:

&amp;#128313; Progress: Represents progress in the bar and must be between 0 and 1. Values outside this range will be interpreted as the closest value (e.g. 2.57 will be represented as 1). - Its default value is 0 - [Receives a double as a value].
&amp;#128313; ProgressColor: It is the color that the bar that represents the percentage of progress in the control takes. - [Receives a Color as a value].
Let&amp;#39;s see a code example:

XAML:



C#:





How to animate a ProgressBar?
You’ll learn two approaches to animating a ProgressBar: Using the ProgressTo method and using the ProgressBarAnimationBehavior from the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit.
Both enables you to animate the progress bar displayed in the control, transitioning it from an initial value to a final value.. They also share the same parameters, that’s why I will first provide a description of these parameters and then we will go into detail about each one later.
➖ Value or Progress: It’s the value up to which the progress bar will be filled. – [Receives a double as a value]
➖ Length: It’s the duration in milliseconds that the animation of the ProgressBar will last. – [Receives a unit as a value]
➖ Easing: Controls acceleration, regulates the speed at which animations occur. – [Receives an Easing as a value]

To know more information about Easing functions you can enter here.



Let’s continue with the details of each one

&amp;#128313; Simple animation



&amp;#128313; ProgressBarAnimationBehavior from MAUI Community Toolkit
⚠ For this example I will skip implementing the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit from scratch. If you don’t know how to do it, I invite you to read this article in the session called Still haven’t implemented it?&amp;#160;and follow the instructions.
Add the following namespace to your page


Finally, you can include the animation (which is a behavior) in your XAML using the following code:




And done!! &amp;#128526;&amp;#160;From now on, you are ready to add ProgressBar in your .NET MAUI Applications. I I hope you like it! &amp;#128154;&amp;#128149;
&amp;lt;Label Text=”Thanks for ready!&amp;#160;&amp;#128075; ” /&amp;gt;

I write down all my dreams, and I dream vividly. Why do we dream? There is no widely accepted explanation. Ancient Egyptians and Greeks believed dreams were visitations from the gods. Jung believed dreams were projections of the unconscious—projections that sought to compensate for the conscious mind’s distortions. Famously, Jung did not disparage the ancient understanding of dreams as divine visitations. He believed gods themselves to be archetypal, projections of a shared unconscious.

      <title>Dynamic vs. Static Config for My Tiling Window Manager</title>
      <link>https://lgug2z.com/articles/dynamic-vs-static-config-for-my-tiling-window-manager/</link>
      <description>For the last few years I have been writing and maintaining a tiling window manager for Windows that has steadily grown in usage and popularity.
My first exposure to tiling window managers was on macOS with kwm (which was succeeded by chunkwm and later yabai). Naturally, this meant that whenever I used Linux, I would reach for bspwm.
I am a big proponent of what I call the &amp;amp;ldquo;bspwm architecture&amp;amp;rdquo; for tiling window managers.</description>

      <title>The First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008</link>
      <description>For the first time in the world, we succeeded in synthesizing the
room-temperature superconductor ($T_c \ge 400$ K, 127$^\circ$C) working at
ambient pressure with a modified lead-apatite (LK-99) structure. The
superconductivity of LK-99 is proved with the Critical temperature ($T_c$),
Zero-resistivity, Critical current ($I_c$), Critical magnetic field ($H_c$),
and the Meissner effect. The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from minute
structural distortion by a slight volume shrinkage (0.48 %), not by external
factors such as temperature and pressure. The shrinkage is caused by Cu$^{2+}$
substitution of Pb$^{2+}$(2) ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate
and it generates the stress. It concurrently transfers to Pb(1) of the
cylindrical column resulting in distortion of the cylindrical column interface,
which creates superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. The heat
capacity results indicated that the new model is suitable for explaining the
superconductivity of LK-99. The unique structure of LK-99 that allows the
minute distorted structure to be maintained in the interfaces is the most
important factor that LK-99 maintains and exhibits superconductivity at room
temperatures and ambient pressure.</description>

      <description>Go programmers have the good fortune of excellent testing and benchmarking
tooling built into the standard library - in the testing package. However,
benchmarking is hard. This isn&amp;#39;t Go specific; it&amp;#39;s just one of those things
experienced developers learn over time.</description>

      <description>@regehr@mastodon.social Back in the day, I got called to a professor’s office (I was IT support in the CS department) and the professor was complaining his Sparc4 was running slow. First thing I did was minimise a window and there was just this black square. Bit by bit roaches slowly moved. Like 0.5 fps. So many xroaches under his xterm that it was just a solid black square. 

The roaches multiply if they’re left alone long enough. This professor NEVER moved windows. So roaches scurried under his windows and then sat there. Never disturbed by being exposed. Slowly multiplying at some rate. Some grad student had thought it would be funny to play a prank on the professor and run xroach on him. But the professor obviously never saw the roaches. So they hid under his windows slowly increasing until finally they soaked up so much RAM that it impaired performance.</description>
