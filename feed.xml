      <title>Software Engineering Within SpaceX - Yasoob Khalid</title>
      <link>https://yasoob.me/posts/software_engineering_within_spacex_launch/</link>
      <description>Hi everyone! üëã I am sure quite a few of you must have seen the SpaceX launch this past Saturday. It was an amazing and historic event. Millions of people were watching it live on YouTube and elsewhere. With each passing day, we are getting closer to commercial space flights and I have to agree I am excited.
In addition to fueling my excitement about space travel, this launch also made me curious about the tech which goes in these rockets.</description>
