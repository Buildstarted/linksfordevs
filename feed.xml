      <title>DeepFakes used in Animations - A New Way of Animating?</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qWUVi52yY</link>
      <description>I used First Order Motion Model for Image Animation, which is similar to DeepFake AIs, but it can do more like tracking motions and copying them onto another target. I feel like this can make creating anything for anime, games, or films a lot easier. The easier is to do something, the overall standard will increase. Looking forward to a lot of good games, movies and anime in the future!

      <description>I still recall the simplicity of standing up a SOAP service and adding a service reference via Visual Studio by simply entering the url to the WSDL – this scenario just worked…. until we moved on. There was a rapid progression away from the overly prescriptive XML based world of SOAP to REST based APIs. … Continue reading "Consuming REST API with Swagger / OpenAPI in Xamarin and Uno Applications"</description>
