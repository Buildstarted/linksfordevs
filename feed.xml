      <title>A way out for a.out</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/888741/5e43489d7ebeda7f/</link>
      <description>The a.out executable
format dates back to the earliest days of Linux — and before.  It has
not been used in any serious way for decades, but support still exists in
the Linux kernel and has resisted all attempts at its removal.  Back in
January, Borislav Petkov tried yet
again to delete support for this format, leading to another extended
discussion.  There is one difference this time around, though: the effort
to get rid of a.out support might just succeed.</description>

      <title>Combining scripts and DSLs is Kotlin’s most underrated feature - S&amp;#233;bastien Castiel</title>

      <description>The more I play with Kotlin, the more convinced I am that a combo of two of its features is vastly underrated: first, the ability to create domain-specific languages (DSL), thanks to some syntactic sugar; then, the ability to write scripts and create interpreters for them.</description>

      <title>On the importance of trusting trust</title>
      <link>https://hozy.dev/posts/trusting-trust/</link>
      <description>Recently, the author of a popular npm package injected code that wipes the files of users from Russia and Belarus. Even though the change was rolled back in a few hours, newer versions of the package still create a text file on the user&amp;#39;s desktop when called. This sparked lively debates around the utility of so-called &amp;#39;protest-ware&amp;#39;, and whether such action is in line with the spirit of open source.</description>

      <title>Extracting web page content using Readability.js and shot-scraper</title>
      <link>https://til.simonwillison.net/shot-scraper/readability</link>
      <description>[Readability.js](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) is &amp;quot;A standalone version of the readability library used for Firefox Reader View&amp;quot;.

My [shot-scraper](https://datasette.io/tools/shot-scraper) tool has a `shot-scraper javascript` command which can load a web page in a headless browser (via [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)), execute JavaScript against that page and return the result to the console as JSON - see [Scraping web pages from the command line with shot-scraper](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/14/scraping-web-pages-shot-scraper/).

I figured out how to use the two of these together to extract the core content from a web page using the command line.

Here&amp;#39;s the recipe:

    shot-scraper javascript https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/24/datasette-061/ &amp;quot;
    async () =&amp;gt; {
      const readability = await import(&amp;#39;https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability&amp;#39;);
      return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
    }&amp;quot;

It&amp;#39;s using Skypack to [load the module](https://www.skypack.dev/view/@mozilla/readability). Playwright (the tech that powers `shot-scarper`) knows how to execute `async ()` functions and return their results.

This outputs the JSON structure created by Readability directly to the console.
```
% shot-scraper javascript https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/24/datasette-061/ &amp;quot;
    async () =&amp;gt; {
      const readability = await import(&amp;#39;https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability&amp;#39;);
      return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
    }&amp;quot;
{
    &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Datasette 0.61: The annotated release notes&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;byline&amp;quot;: null,
    &amp;quot;dir&amp;quot;: null,
    &amp;quot;lang&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;en-gb&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;readability-page-1&amp;quot; cla...
```
Piping to `jq keys` shows the keys in the returned object:
```
% shot-scraper javascript https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/24/datasette-061/ &amp;quot;
    async () =&amp;gt; {
      const readability = await import(&amp;#39;https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability&amp;#39;);
      return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
    }&amp;quot; | jq keys
[
  &amp;quot;byline&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;dir&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;excerpt&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;lang&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;length&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;siteName&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;textContent&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;
]
```

To get just the text content, use `jq .textContent -r` (the `-r` returns the raw string, without the surrounding double quotes):
```
% shot-scraper javascript https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/24/datasette-061/ &amp;quot;
    async () =&amp;gt; {
      const readability = await import(&amp;#39;https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability&amp;#39;);
      return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
    }&amp;quot; | jq .textContent -r
I released Datasette 0.61 this morning—closely followed by 0.61.1 to fix a minor bug.
Here are the annotated release notes.

In preparation for Datasette 1.0, this release includes ...
```
I can even pipe it directly into `sqlite-utils` to insert it into a SQLite database table:

```
% shot-scraper javascript https://simonwillison.net/2021/Oct/19/datasette-059/ &amp;quot;
async () =&amp;gt; {    
  const readability = await import(&amp;#39;https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability&amp;#39;);
  return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
}&amp;quot; | sqlite-utils insert articles.db articles -

## Saving the script to a file

If you want to run this a lot, you can avoid copying-and-pasting it by saving it to a file called `readability.js`:

```javascript
async () =&amp;gt; {    
  const readability = await import(&amp;#39;https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability&amp;#39;);
  return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse();
}
```

And then running:

    shot-scraper javascript https://til.simonwillison.net/shot-scraper/readability -i readability.js

Or even set that up as an alias, by adding the following to `~/.zshrc`:

    alias readability=&amp;quot;shot-scraper javascript -i ~/readability.js&amp;quot;

Then restart a terminal window and run:

    readability https://til.simonwillison.net/shot-scraper/readability

## A note on safety

The [Readability.js README says](https://github.com/mozilla/readability/blob/0.4.1/README.md#security):

&amp;gt; If you&amp;#39;re going to use Readability with untrusted input (whether in HTML or DOM form), we **strongly** recommend you use a sanitizer library like [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) to avoid script injection when you use the output of Readability.

It looks like DOMPurify could be executed against the output of Readability using the same import mechanism shown above.</description>
