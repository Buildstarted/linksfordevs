      <link>https://ardalis.com/configuring-logging-in-azure-app-services</link>
      <description>Azure App Services are a very easy and economical way to quickly deploy your ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core apps to the cloud. You can get started for free if you just want to try out something you’re developing (without uptime considerations) and entry-level plans are pretty affordable: The docs for publishing to an Azure App Service are …</description>

      <title>Watching More Files With Dotnet Watch For Static Sites</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/watching-more-files-with-dotnet-watch-for-static-sites</link>
      <description>The marriage of .NET Core and static site generators is a beautiful thing. There are many great static site generator options out there like 11ty, Jekyll, Hugo, and many more. While you can accomplish amazing feats at build time, a dynamic backend can allow your application features that are not possible at build time. The combination of .NET Core and the static site generator of your choice is a powerful one-two punch. In this post, I’ll show you how to set up an ASP.NET Core application hosting a static site generator, with the added ability to watch all files within your project.</description>

      <description>Every year, Class Central publishes rankings of the world’s highest rated and
most popular online courses.

These rankings are based on user ratings and total enrollments. You can see the
full annual course ratings here [https://www.classcentral.com/rankings].

But in this article, I'm going to adopt a different approach. Instead of just
showing the top courses, I'll show you which universities seem to have the best
courses overall, then show you all the free online courses those universities

      <description>A year ago, Microsoft enabled .NET developers to work with Apache Spark using C# or F#, instead of Python or Scala. More functionality and performance enhancements have since been layered on. The result shows how software world demarcations can be transcended.</description>

      <description>When efficiency increases, consumption drops, right? Errr... No.. So far, increased efficiency has mostly lead to increased consumption.  

This is called Jevons Paradox, discovered by William Stanley Jevons in 1865. He was concerned that improved steam engines would make England run out of coal faster!
