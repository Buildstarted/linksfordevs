      <description>The AirPods Pro “Rattlegate”
The first generation of the AirPods was generally regarded as a perfect product. “Apple at its best!” was the universally accepted opinion.
I used them for a long time. No speaker issues, no battery issues.
Excited for the noise cancelling feature I ordered the AirPods Pro and for the first few months everything was fine. One day the left AirPod started buzzing every time I was moving my head.</description>

      <title>A $50.000/year streaming service | Gianluca Mauro</title>
      <link>https://blog.gianlucamauro.com/post/harvard-online-learning/</link>
      <description>Harvard University announced that next academic year will be 100% online.
And the tuition won’t be a dime cheaper.
Why does it matter?
I don’t want to question the worthiness of such an investment. Yet, I can’t help but wonder if you’ll loose some of your returns by switching from the Harvard University halls to your web browser.
When you give $50.000 to a University like Harvard, you’re paying for a bunch of stuff.</description>

      <title>A .NET Color Console Helper</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Jul/10/A-NET-Console-Color-Helper?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20RickStrahl%20(Rick%20Strahl%27s%20WebLog)</link>
      <description>In this short post I'll discuss a small Console helper class I've been using to make it easier and more consistent to use colors with the .NET Console command.
