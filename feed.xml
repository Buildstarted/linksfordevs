      <title>Core Guidelines are not Rules - Simplify C++!</title>
      <link>https://arne-mertz.de/2024/03/core-guidelines-are-not-rules/</link>
      <description>There is a difference between guidelines and rules. Boiling down guidelines to one-sentence rules has drawbacks that make your code harder to understand.</description>

      <title>Detailed Macrophotography of PCBs</title>
      <link>https://niemczuk.tech/2024/02/11/detailed-macrophotography-of-PCBs</link>
      <description>I had to create scans of a small flex PCB to capture more details than a flat scanner could give me. Of course, this task turned out harder than I imagined. I already had a good camera, but I was lacking a good macro lens. Buying one turned out to be hard because the highest magnification ratios on most macro lenses are 1:1. The better ones are, of course, pricier.</description>

      <title>How the internet works, and how I&amp;#39;ll exploit it – kbrecordzz</title>
      <link>http://kbrecordzz.com/2024/03/how-the-internet-works/</link>
      <description>The internet is cool, a lot of computers around the whole world are connected to each other in all possible directions and angles, and because of that you can do almost anything. There&amp;#39;s no single definitive way for how your computer connects to my web server in Stockholm, but when you visit https://notacarclub.kbrecordzz.com it indeed happens, there are actually many different paths the data can take between your computer and my server, it can change at any time, even in the middle of a connection, and I never understood how it works. The standard explanation for how the internet works, if you&amp;#39;re not looking in thick technical books that require you to already know the answer before you can read it, is that &amp;quot;you enter the domain name &amp;quot;google.com&amp;quot; into your browser, then the browser asks a &amp;quot;DNS server&amp;quot; to convert that domain name to an IP address, which is a type of address that your computer understands&amp;quot; and then everything works. But it still doesn&amp;#39;t explain why the data takes certain paths, and what makes it do it, which is weird because that&amp;#39;s what the internet is: Data taking different paths between computers all around the world. There are billions of computers and they obviously need to keep track of where the other billions of computers are. How is it possible?</description>

      <title>CSS Variable Groups • Lea Verou</title>
      <link>https://lea.verou.me/docs/var-groups/</link>
      <description>CSS Variable Groups is a way to define multiple properties under the same namespace and pass the entire group around,
addressing several pain points around design tokens, design systems, and integrating third-party components.
The proposal has been posted to the CSS WG repo and received significant attention by the community.</description>

      <title>Fast postgres index creation</title>
      <link>https://stephenn.com/2024/03/fast-postgres-index-creation/</link>
      <description>Fast postgres index creation Postgres is a fantastic database for a multitude of reasons, celebrated for its reliability and flexibility. However, when creating indexes on large tables, it can sometimes feel sluggish. This becomes even more noticeable when your project requires the creation of numerous indexes, potentially slowing down your progress.
Configure CPU and RAM available for index creation There are two settings that control the amount of server resources available for index creation, maintenance_work_mem and max_parallel_maintenance_workers.</description>

      <title>PG Phriday: Redefining Postgres High Availability</title>
      <link>https://bonesmoses.org/2024/pg-phriday-redefining-postgres-high-availability/</link>
      <description>What is High Availability to Postgres? I’ve staked my career on the answer to that question since I first presented an HA stack to Postgres Open in 2012, and I still don’t feel like there’s an acceptable answer. No matter how the HA techniques have advanced since then, there’s always been a nagging suspicion in my mind that something is missing.
But I’m here to say that a bit of research has uncovered an approach that many different Postgres cloud vendors appear to be converging upon.</description>

      <title>Zen of Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://sjosund.com/zen-of-ml/</link>
      <description>Machine learning can be a frustrating endeavour, and I know several ML engineers who have transitioned to SWE roles – the unpredictability of machine learning being at the heart of their frustrations. You never know if or when your model will be good enough for production or if your new algorithm- or data idea will give any improvements. Usually, they don’t. Additionally, the feedback loop in ML is typically slow. These factors combined can lead to a sense of loss of control.

      <title>Patching Software Using Nix (For Laymen)</title>
      <link>https://anthonyoleinik.com/blog_directory/patching-software-using-nix/</link>
      <description>Patching softwarea quick rundown on patching, since it has become apparent that it is not in every dev’s toolbox: code is just text files. There exists a file format that is a diff between real code and desired code; for instance, maybe you want to add a feature or change some functionality. You can make your edits and generate a patch file and then apply it to the source to get a version with your changes. is incredibly powerful. Instead of having to maintain a fork, or figure out how to distribute your version of the patched software, you can keep a .patch file alongside your nix code and apply it at build time.</description>
