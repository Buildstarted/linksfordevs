      <title>An F# Primitive Giraffe Wearing Lenses: A Ports and Adapters Story</title>
      <link>https://www.codit.eu/blog/a-f-primitive-giraffe-wearing-lenses-a-ports-and-adapters-story/</link>
      <description>The start of both architectures is the same: the domain. The ports and adapters architecture is often referred to as an onion structure. The reason for this is that when the application is growing you’ll see a set of layers being added on top of each other, like onion peel. The domain is always the core, the layers on top of that depend on your application. The outside layer is the outside world: this could be writing to the database, receiving an API request, or reading a file on disk – anything that is not under your control should be considered the ‘outside world’ or ‘untrusted’. You’ll notice the core of your union, the place within your control, is fairly small. In functional programming, this domain is usually pure. This is a big difference from the object-oriented approach where you inject ‘impure’ or ‘untrusted’ services within core functionality. The data direction is a lot simpler and descriptive in a port and adapter architecture. The direction and relation between the layers are made explicit while in a dependency injection system. This relation is often scattered.</description>

      <title>How To Remove All Blocks-Related Stuff From WordPress &amp;#183; Notes</title>
      <link>https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2022/remove-blocks-wordpress/</link>
      <description>With each new version of WordPress, it becomes more obvious that the future of the platform is in Gutenberg/its blocks metaphor.
I really don&amp;amp;amp;rsquo;t like blocks, and this poses a problem to me. The most promising alternative to WordPress, ClassicPress, is far from the desired level of maturity for more demanding scenarios, such as my Portuguese blog, Manual do Usu&amp;#225;rio.
For now, it is still possible to suppress all blocks-related stuff from up to date WordPress installations.</description>

      <link>https://willfennel.com/posts/2022/11/07/we-need-a-light-switch-for-static-hosting.html</link>
      <description>I’ve never been self-loathing enough to get a Twitter account, but I hear there’s a lot of riff-raff on the internet about people moving to different platforms. Most of that is just the media looking for reasons to post about whatever the current viral thing is, of course, I don’t think a large percentage of people are moving. Oh noes! Twitter changed ownership from people who are motivated by money, and now it’s owned by someone else who is motivated by money! Nothing big is going to happen, most people will stay on Twitter, and I hear the alternatives suck anyway.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#39;ve been using React for a while, you may have noticed times when the freedom and wild nature of JavaScript works against you (and not because of JS &amp;#128516;). This can be especially true if you&amp;#39;re working in a team. You may not know it, but you need TypeScript</description>

      <description>In the first installment of this series, we looked at returning results from a limited pool of items in a Lucene full text index. In this second installment, we significantly increase the number of generated items (3,000, by default) and add a numbered paging system, as used by the main commercial search engines and search sites.</description>

      <title>Marking API&amp;#39;s as obsolete or as experimental</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/1d97ea56-9a32-4067-9919-10b9af5623a6</link>
      <description>Often times your API in your program or library evolves. So you will need a mechanism of telling that a specific API (an interface or just a simple method call) is obsolete and might be not there anymore in the next major version.
Also it can happen that you have a preview version of a API, which might not be rock-stable and the API-surface might change. How do we indicate that to the user?

      <title>Simple Autocomplete for Blazor</title>
      <link>https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/362/simple-autocomplete-for-blazor</link>
      <description>One of the things I really like about Blazor is how often it is easy to implement 
features in your application that, if needed in a server-side application, would have you testing your JavaScript-fu or 
reaching for a third party component. One example is an autocomplete component 
that fetches live data from a database that matches that which a user enters 
into a form control and changes as the user types. In this 
article, I&amp;#39;ll show how to build such a component for a Blazor WebAssembly app 
and style it like a dropdown.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://blog.lhotka.net/2022/11/06/Thoughts-On-Social-Media</link>
      <description>Given all that’s happening at Twitter I, like many people, started looking at alternatives like Mastodon. Folks already part of the Mastodon world (fediverse they call it) seem to be a mix of excitement as their corner of reality is discovered by the larger world, and fear as their corner of reality is invaded by random folks from the larger world. Very understandable! Like many people, this whole thing has me thinking about how I use social media, and what I want out of it. I’ve spent decades building or being part of online communities, starting with my multi-user dungeon (MUD) community in university, various groups in UseNet around TTRPG games, Babylon 5, and software development, and of course decades of open-source around #cslanet. In all cases there’s some element of “marketing” to make like-minded people aware of the community so they can find and join it. Maybe a little less with UseNet, given its hierarchical naming conventions that provided built-in discoverability. In all other cases though, it has taken real work to build awareness of the community. I know from listening to many folks in Black Twitter that the same is true there: a lot of people have put a lot of effort over a long time to build up what is known as Black Twitter. Along with some frustration that Twitter “productizes” these virtual communities that exist within the broader Twitter environment. With #cslanet, I’ve never focused on building a big community on Twitter, as I don’t think it is the right tool for the job. Nor is Mastodon from what I can tell. I’ve used a number of forum/discussion platforms over the decades, and currently use GitHub Discussions. Each time I’ve moved from one platform to another I’ve lost massive numbers of community members, and the community has slowly rebuilt itself over time. Today, my use of social media is personal and professional, and the only place the two really overlap is on Twitter. Why? I “blame” Scott Hanselman, who has long advocated to bring your entire self to Twitter, and to some degree I’ve followed his advice. On Facebook I have a personal page for family and friends, and separate professional pages/groups for things like #cslanet and my other professional interests. LinkedIn is purely professional, and I actively unfollow/mute anyone who discusses anything outside of their profession. I use Instagram to follow rock bands mostly, and rarely post at all. I use TikTok to consume entertainment and news. Twitter is unique, in that it is the one platform where I consume culture, news, entertainment, rock band content, professional information, goofy social interactions, and more. It is the one place where I mix personal and professional interests. So can Mastodon replace Twitter in that regard? I think technically yes, but only if a critical mass of culturally thoughtful people, rock bands, the software development community, my friends, and a lot of other folks move to Mastodon. I have friends who’ve found Twitter to be toxic and they hate it. Somehow I’ve managed to curate who I follow such that (other than the leadup to the MAGA elections) my Twitter experience is almost entirely rich and enjoyable. I expect the same is possible on Mastodon - again assuming that a critical mass of folks become active on that platform. That “critical mass” is what rightly excites and scares pre-existing Mastodon users, because we’re talking about (just for me) many hundreds of people, each of whom will come with their many hundreds of people. So we’re talking about (probably) hundreds of thousands of users becoming active on Mastodon. And that’ll be enough people to bring out the trolls, criminals, and other bad actors. I’ve also read a thought piece suggesting that fleeing Twitter for anywhere will be a major disservice to minority communities, because groups like Black Twitter might take a very long time to reform anywhere else. I have two thoughts on that. One is that it is true that any move from one platform to another harms a community, and it takes time for that community to rebuild. Two is that maybe something like Mastodon can provide a better long-term home because these communities aren’t a “product” like they are on Twitter, and so maybe it is ultimately healthier to move. Pragmatically, I’ll say that in the end I’ll use whatever tool/platform provides me access to the people and content I desire. And if that ends up not being just one platform, so be it - though I’ll miss the intersectionality of my tech colleagues interacting with sci-fi authors who interact with musicians who interact with deep thinkers about culture and society. I’m @rockylhotka on Twitter and @rockylhotka@fosstodon.org on Mastodon.</description>

      <description>You might have heard that mutable value types are evil. But why is that and why does the .NET framework use them then? Are they really that evil?
Let&amp;#39;s have a look at a few examples and have a look what is going on!

      <title>Azure DevOps Podcast: Isaac Abraham: Farmer for Azure Deployments - Episode 216</title>
      <link>http://feed.azuredevops.show/isaac-abraham-farmer-for-azure-deployments-episode-216</link>
      <description>Isaac Abraham is an. NET MVP and a .NET developer since .NET 1.0 with an interest in cloud computing and distributed data problems. He is the author of Get Programming with F# and is the director of Compositional IT. He specializes in consultancy, training, and development, helping customers adopt high-quality, functional-first solutions on the .NET platform. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [3:12] Isaac talks about getting into Software Dev, how he sought to work in a small space where he could learn hands-on about .NET development, and how he has been doing that ever since. [4:22] How has the landscape changed? [5:00] Isaac got into Azure during the early days. [6:59] How is consulting different? [13:20] What exactly is Farmer, and how do we use it? [16:44] Does it matter which .NET language the nougat package is pulled into? [18:29] An F# project can exist nicely in a Visual Studio solution with other C# projects. [19:59] With Isaac’s unabashed opinion on Farmer, does he prefer having one project that has all of the infrastructure code for both with all the components that are deployed in the application, or does he prefer referencing pharma from the different applications and distributing that logic? [29:48] Isaac does use Azure Client, but ironically, it’s only to deploy the templates that Farmer generates. &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  — New video podcast!

      <title>.NET Rocks! Making Open Source Work for Everyone with David Whitney</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1818</link>
      <description>How do we make open source work for everyone? While at NDC in Oslo, Carl and Richard talked to David Whitney about his experiences working on open-source projects, and the challenges of making them sustainable. David talks about how many projects start with an individual making something for themselves, which then evolves into many people utilizing the project, but not contributing to it. And when companies depend on that software, the pressure on the creators gets serious - but without compensation. How do we make open source better? And how do the tech giants make the situation better or worse?</description>

      <title>Avoid WebDeploy Locking Errors to IIS with Shadow Copy for ASP.NET Core Apps</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Nov/07/Avoid-WebDeploy-Locking-Errors-to-IIS-with-Shadow-Copy-for-ASPNET-Core-Apps</link>
      <description>If you&amp;#39;re self-hosting ASP.NET Core applications on IIS and using WebDeploy to publish to the server, you&amp;#39;ve very likely run into the dreaded locked file problem on the server. In this post I show you how you can work around locking problems with the base WebDeploy configuration and by using a new experimental feature in ASP.NET 6.0 to Shadow Copy deploy binaries. As a bonus this post also describes setting up and using Web Deploy in some detail.</description>

      <description>When it came time to reckon with social media’s failings, nobody ran to the “web3” platforms. Nobody asked “can I get paid per message”? Nobody asked about the blockchain. The community of people who’ve been quietly doing this work for years (decades!) ended up being the ones who welcomed everyone over, as always.</description>
