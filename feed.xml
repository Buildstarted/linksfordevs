      <title>The Toothpick Problem</title>
      <link>https://acutebar.in/posts/math/toothpick-problem/</link>
      <description>The Problem # Take a square piece of paper. Take a toothpick of a given length. At intervals equal to the length of the toothpick, draw lines on the piece of paper. Now, randomly toss a bunch of such toothpicks so that they fall over the paper. What fraction of the toothpicks will fall in a way so that they intersect one of the lines drawn? In other words, what is the probability of a single toothpick falling over a line?</description>

      <title>Building a basic search experience with Postgres</title>
      <link>https://www.pacenthink.io/post/building-a-basic-search-experience-with-postgres/</link>
      <description>Building search functionality in products is a common task. Many solutions exist to solve this problem already. OpenSource tools like opensearch and mellisearch are some examples that are very commonly used. Using a 3rd party tool to build a &amp;amp;ldquo;full-text search&amp;amp;rdquo; is a good bet if you have a lot of data (i.e. a lot of users).
The goal of this post is to have a look at some in-built tools to build a minimalist search feature when your data is backed by a Postgres (or any SQL) database.</description>

      <title>The birth of a package manager</title>
      <link>https://ochagavia.nl/blog/the-birth-of-a-package-manager/</link>
      <description>Since my time at the university, pursuing a Computer Science degree, I have always been fascinated by programming languages and the tooling around them: compilers, IDEs, package managers, etc. Eventually, that got me involved as a hobbyist in the development of the Rust compiler and rust-analyzer, but I never got the chance to work professionally on programming language tooling… until two months ago! In January, the nice folks at prefix.dev asked me to help them develop the rattler package manager, and there is lots to tell about what we have achieved since then, so buckle up!</description>

      <title>&amp;quot;Leadership&amp;quot;</title>
      <link>https://codethrasher.com/posts/leadership/</link>
      <description>I’ve opened my eyes.
Leadership is crucial. It seems obvious, but in my naivet&amp;#233; I thought a team of sufficiently-capable engineers could operate fairly independently of managerial/c-level leadership. You have Product give us some specs and we can make it happen…
Until it doesn’t.
Team dynamics and personal motivations can run smoothly until you have a crisis of some sort and the team either begins infighting to assuage guilt, or becomes shell shocked to the point of impotence.</description>

      <description>WkHtmlToPdf is a commonly used tool to create PDF documents from HTML files or Urls. Unfortunately it&amp;#39;s a bit cranky and one of the problems you can run into is that links that include URL encoding won&amp;#39;t work in your output PDF. In this post I describe the problem and a hacky workaround to make broken PDF links work by hacking the HTML file prior to conversion.</description>

      <title>.NET Rocks! Developer Velocity in the Cloud with Bryan Foster</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1837</link>
      <description>How can the cloud help developer velocity? Carl and Richard talk to Bryan Foster about the complexities of modern software development - and how different cloud technologies can help move faster and not be afraid to break a few things along the way! Bryan talks about using Azure Deployment Environments to make it easy for developers to stand up resources for their apps - and just as quickly shut them down when done. This leads to a broader conversation around the governance of CI/CD pipelines and the role of the cloud, even to the point of using DevBox to have an entirely virtualized development environment!</description>

      <title>GPT-4</title>
      <link>https://openai.com/research/gpt-4</link>
      <description>We’ve created GPT-4, the latest milestone in OpenAI’s effort in scaling up deep learning. GPT-4 is a large multimodal model (accepting image and text inputs, emitting text outputs) that, while less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Request for startup: double-blind messaging</title>

      <description>The following is an idea that has been in the back of my mind for a long time. However, from a technical perspective it is now markedly easier to engineer with the appearance of GPT-4 and similar LLM APIs. If you&amp;#39;ve been thinking about something like this, please reach out!</description>

      <title>SI Units of Simile</title>
      <link>http://blog.karliner.net/posts/units-of-simile/</link>
      <description>The International System of Units, often referred to as the SI System, defines small number of basic units, such as the second (time), metre (distance), kilogram (mass).
However, for the popular media these units have proved too limiting for the magnificent descriptive powers of our journalists and broadcasters, who have therefore evolved an alternative set of units which are used exclusively in the hackneyed writing of, well, hacks.
These are:</description>

      <title>Patterns &amp;amp; Abstractions - Without boats, dreams dry up</title>
      <link>https://without.boats/blog/patterns-and-abstractions/</link>
      <description>This is the second post in an informal series commenting on the design of async Rust in 2023. In my
previous post, after a discussion of the “registers” in which control-flow effects could
be handled in Rust, I promised to turn my attention to recent proposals around a concept called
“keyword generics.” For reference, there are two posts by the current design team of Rust that are
my reference point for this commentary:</description>

      <title>Why AppSec fails</title>
      <link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/why_appsec_fails/</link>
      <description>Let me tell you a story about Application Security (AppSec). It contains heroes and villains, and I’m not necessarily thinking about the defenders and attackers here. It contains lots of interesting technology that is often overemphasised. We’ve got whole industries that work on letting us know how scary it is out there, vulnerabilities that are marketed like rock stars and terminology that makes you quiver in your boots: who would want to fall victim to an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?</description>
