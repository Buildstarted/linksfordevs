      <title>Clostridioides difficile spores tolerate disinfection with sodium hypochlorite disinfectant and remain viable within surgical scrubs and gown fabrics</title>
      <link>https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/mic.0.001418</link>
      <description>&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;Clostridioides difficile&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea globally. Its spores have been implicated in the prevalence of &amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;C. difficile&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; infection due to their resistance and transmission ability between surfaces. Currently, disinfectants such as chlorine-releasing agents (CRAs) and hydrogen peroxide are used to decontaminate and reduce the incidence of infections in clinical environments. Our previous research demonstrated the ability of &amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;C. difficile&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; spores to survive exposure to recommended concentrations of sodium dichloroisocyanurate in liquid form and within personal protective fabrics such as surgical gowns; however, the present study examined the spore response to clinical in-use concentrations of sodium hypochlorite. Spores were exposed to a 10 min contact time of 1000, 5000 and 10 000 p.p.m. sodium hypochlorite, and spore recovery was determined. To understand whether biocide-exposed spores transmitted across clinical surfaces in vitro, biocide-exposed spores were spiked onto surgical scrubs and patient gowns and recovery was determined by a plate transfer assay. Scanning electron microscopy was used to establish if there were any morphological changes to the outer spore coat. The results revealed that viable biocide-exposed &amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;C. difficile&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; spores can be recovered from surgical scrubs and patient gowns, with no observable changes to spore morphology, highlighting the potential of these fabrics as vectors of spore transmission. This study demonstrates that alternative strategies should be urgently sought to disinfect &amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;C. difficile&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; spores to break the chain of transmission in clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Product and Project Management</title>
      <link>https://christiaanse.ca/posts/product-project/</link>
      <description>After a recent interview while hunting for jobs, an interesting topic came up, which was the difference between project and product managers. We spent a bit of time going around on the topic and I wanted to write down my thoughts here as well.
The project manager understands everything in terms of process and boundary conditions – meaning the goals and resources of the project. They fit the work that needs to be done and into those conditions set out at the start of the project.</description>

      <title>Why do I know shell, and how can you? - Julio Merino (jmmv.dev)</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/why-do-i-know-shell-and-how-can-you.html</link>
      <description>&amp;amp;ldquo;Why do you know so much shell?&amp;amp;rdquo; is a question I&amp;amp;rsquo;m getting a lot at work lately. So yeah, why? And how can you learn it too? There is no secret here: I know the shell well because I was &amp;amp;ldquo;forced&amp;amp;rdquo; to write tools in it for a while and, because of that, I made a conscious effort to learn the language and get better at it.
You see, most people that write shell don&amp;amp;rsquo;t want to deal with it. They stitch together whatever works into a script and call it a day, making a bunch of spaghetti even if it goes against the coding best practices they already know. And when they encounter some odd syntax they don&amp;amp;rsquo;t recognize, their reaction is to say &amp;amp;ldquo;this has to be rewritten in Python!&amp;amp;rdquo; instead of taking a breath and trying to really understand what&amp;amp;rsquo;s going on. It doesn&amp;amp;rsquo;t help that plenty of senior engineers scoff at shell scripts.
And it is true: the shell is arcane and has many flaws as a programming language. I don&amp;amp;rsquo;t want to convince you to start writing new tools in it. But the shell is also an incredible rapid prototyping language, and you can use it to solve business problems really quickly and with surprisingly little code. If you pause for a second to learn it, you&amp;amp;rsquo;ll realize that you can bend tradition and write maintainable shell code too. Hear out how I got into writing so much shell and how you can get better at it too.

      <title>attribution armored code</title>
      <link>https://joeyh.name/blog/entry/attribution_armored_code/</link>
      <description>Attribution of source code has been limited to comments, but a deeper
embedding of attribution into code is possible. When an embedded
attribution is removed or is incorrect, the code should no longer work.
I&amp;#39;ve developed a way to do this in Haskell that is lightweight to add, but
requires more work to remove than seems worthwhile for someone who is
training an LLM on my code. And when it&amp;#39;s not removed, it invites LLM
hallucinations of broken code.</description>

      <title>Your next ten years</title>
      <link>https://josem.co/your-next-ten-years/</link>
      <description>It’s amazing what we can achieve in ten years.
At 15, Hakeem Olajuwon joined a local Nigerian sports tournament. He had planned to play handball there but ended up playing basketball, and it changed his life.
“He couldn’t even dunk at first,” said one of his first coaches in an interview.
The article’s headline was “Olajuwon: He’s not the best yet.” They didn’t know how accurate it was.
A decade later, he was the undisputed leader of the Houston Rockets in the 1988-1989 season.</description>
