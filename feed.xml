      <title>Azure DevOps Podcast: Maddy Montaquila: MAUI applications in .NET 7  - Episode 244</title>
      <link>http://feed.azuredevops.show/maui-applications-in-net-7-with-maddy-montaquila-episode-244</link>
      <description>Maddy Montaquila is a Senior Product Manager on the .NET MAUI team and has been working with .NET mobile apps since 2018 working on Xamarin tooling. When she first joined Microsoft and worked with the Xamarin team as an intern, she realized the impact that she could have in creating amazing developer tools and frameworks, which inspired her to pursue a role as Program Manager. You can connect with her on Twitter and GitHub @maddymontaquila! &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [4:21] How did Maddy get lucked into development and the mobile side of product management? [7:39] You can distill product manager roles to the intersection of the technology and what’s possible, the business, what’s going to make you money, and what your customers actually want and need. [9:17] Why is it important for program managers to have at least some coding background? [10:41] When people dive into Maui, what can they expect right now? [15:44] What tools or resources does someone need to get started, and what are the limitations? [20:44] What is the current DevOps story for going from a developer workstation all the way through testing and packaging, and then finally delivering it to the App Store? [23:47] Is there a favorite deployed test framework? [27:26] Why does Maddy prefer sometimes to work in Xaml? [29:17] If you’re going to reach for controls right now, is everything that they need built-in? What is the status of DevExpress? [37:03] It’s a great time to be a .net developer! &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:     — New Video Podcast!

      <title>Prompt Engineering is for Transactional Prompting</title>
      <link>https://mitchellh.com/writing/prompt-engineering-transactional-prompting</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve noticed a consistent point of confusion whenever prompt engineering
is discussed and I believe the confusion stems from two distinct ways of using
a language model: interactive prompting and transactional prompting.
Prompt engineering is primarily about transactional prompting, and a considerable
amount of confusion or negativity arises when an individual tries to apply it
to interactive prompting.</description>
