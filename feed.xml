      <description>In the beginning, things were simple: you had two strings (a username and a password) and if someone knew both of them, they could log in. Easy.  But the ecosystem in which they were used was simple too, for example in MIT's Time-Sharing Computer, considered to be the first computer</description>

      <title>Working with Channels in .NET</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT06qvQLtJ0</link>
      <description>Channels enable a producer to safely pass data over to a consumer along with the appropriate notifications in both directions. 

In this episode, Stephen Toub chats with Rich about the what, why and how of using the System.Threadding.Channels library. They walk us through a simple demo of using channels and also discuss the various strategies at our disposal.

[00:55] - What are channels used for?
[01:35] - Creating a basic channel implementation
[09:15] - Moving to System.Threadding.Channels
[11:34] - What are the benefits of using the System.Threadding.Channels?
[14:11] - What are some of the available back pressure strategies?
[20:58] - Working with varying number of producers or consumers
[21:54] - What are the merits of Channels compared to Pipelines?
[23:35] - Can channels be used out of process scenarios?
[24:30] - Can channels be used with pub/sub 
[25:28] - What‚Äôs next for channels?

      <title>Analyzing Analytics (Featuring: The FBI)</title>
      <link>https://exploits.run/analytics-analysis-fbi/</link>
      <description>Recently while conducting some research, I found myself down the path of Google Analytics ID‚Äôs as well as other analytics services. I was investigating ways to not only identify varying analytics code in sites, but to correlate them with other sites that may be linked to the same owner. Please note before further reading: I make some guesses about what I find, though that‚Äôs contrary to the concept of analysis, and I am not presuming to know definitively why I am seeing what I am seeing in this specific case study. It‚Äôs all just very curious to me. Dive in and take a look for yourself!</description>

In this episode we make some tweaks to the train and track drawing and generally get everything looking much nicer, and make a start on collision detection, but not with very fruitful results if I'm honest.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2019 Aggressive Clustered Columnstore Cleanup</title>
      <link>https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/aggressive-clustered-columnstore-cleanup/</link>
      <description>In late March 2020, we upgraded our production SQL Servers to SQL Server 2019 with CU3. After finishing the upgrade, we hit an issue with clustered columnstore that we hadn‚Äôt experienced in the previous version of SQL, SQL Server 2017. The issue also wasn‚Äôt something we encountered during our extensive testing on various servers in development, which dated back to September 2019. The problem has been mitigated, but I wanted to share our experience.</description>

But there‚Äôs massive sampling bias. All this advice will try to draw grand, sweeping narratives and also typically fails to sufficiently factor in luck.</description>
