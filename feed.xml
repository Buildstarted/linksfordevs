      <title>Sundown town - Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown_town</link>
      <description>Sundown towns, also known as sunset towns or gray towns, are all-white municipalities or neighborhoods in the United States that practiced a form of segregation by excluding non-whites via some combination of discriminatory local laws, intimidation, and violence. Entire sundown counties[1] and sundown suburbs were also created by the same process. The term came from signs posted that "colored people" had to leave town by sundown.[2] The practice was not restricted to the southern states, as "(a)t least until the early 1960s...northern states could be nearly as inhospitable to black travelers as states like Alabama or Georgia."[3]</description>

      <title>Scamming the scammers -- catching the virus call centre scammers red-handed</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjKjyMKj3n4</link>
      <description>Follow me on Twitter @troyhunt for more scammer updates.

Ever have one of those calls from the other side of the world where the person at the other end of the phone claims your PC has got a virus and they can fix it up for you? I had one recently and played along with the operator while recording the episode, right up until they want to take remote control of the machine. But it left me wondering; what happens once they get control? So I decided to call them back and let them do *whatever* they wanted while recording both screen and audio.

      <description>In December 2019, my girlfriend mentioned that my hair smelled unusually good. What was I doing differently? Nothing, I thought. Everything was just as always. Except that I had run out of shampoo a few weeks prior, and hadn’t noticed until then.</description>
