      <title>Warning on lower case type names in C# 11</title>
      <link>https://blog.paranoidcoding.com/2022/04/11/lowercase-type-names.html</link>
      <description>C# 11 is the next version of C# coming in .NET 7, and it is introducing a warning wave that issues a warning when a type is declared with all lower-case letters. This is being done so that in the future the language can begin moving away from conditional keywords and instead use full on keywords instead. The warning is alerting customers to types that may become keywords in future versions.</description>

      <description>The C# nullability features introduced in C#8 help you minimize the likelihood of encountering that dreaded System.NullReferenceException.Nullability syntax and annotations give hints on whether a type can be nullable or not.Better static analysis is available to catch unhandled nulls while developing your code. What’s not to like?</description>

Have you every felt that you were trapped working on something that you don’t enjoy anymore? Size is something that I’m sure most developers with the drive to do side projects have felt. Recently I have been completing more projects with more success than ever before. This is my new process.</description>

      <title>CSS Mirror Editing with Sourcemapped files (Sass, React…) – we need you to make it better</title>
      <link>https://christianheilmann.com/2022/04/08/css-mirror-editing-with-sourcemapped-files-sass-react-we-need-you-to-make-it-better/</link>
      <description>Using the Edge Developer Tools for VS Code extension, you can live edit files in the browser developer tools and all the changes are also happen in your source files. That way you never lose a change you did to your web projects in the developer tools. It makes tweaking a layout much more convenient than jumping in between editor and browser all the time.</description>

      <title>Use CSS.escape() to escape QuerySelectorAll()</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Apr/10/Use-CSSescape-to-escape-QuerySelectorAll</link>
      <description>Ran into an issue recently where a querySelector operation was failing in document link navigation when navigating hashes. There are a few issues at work when using Hash navigation but one issue i didn&amp;#39;t expect to run into was a naming conflict of a hash tag that interfered with CSS operators. Turns out there&amp;#39;s an easy solution around with with CSS.escape - if you can make the connection. In this post I talk about the problem how it might show up and how to fix it.</description>

      <title>An Ode To Paper Todos</title>
      <link>https://matthewc.dev/musings/paper-todos/</link>
      <description>I love a todo list. It captures my goals and desires in a semi-succinct and concrete way. There are hundreds if not thousands of todo apps and methods. But to me personally, one stands out above all the others.
A simple 3x5 notecard.
This is a how-to or a help article. This is a love letter.
A love letter to paper.
The simple idea of writing down your list of things to do on a physical surface with your own hand is something I love.</description>
