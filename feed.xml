      <title>Moving Google toward the mainline</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/871195/d7e9acf5894446e6/</link>
      <description>Two Google engineers came to Open
Source Summit North America 2021 to talk about a project to change the
way the company creates and maintains the kernel it runs in its data
centers on its production
systems. Andrew Delgadillo and Dylan Hatch described the current production
kernel (Prodkernel) and the problems that occur because it is so far from
the mainline.  Project Icebreaker is an effort to change that and to
provide a near-mainline kernel for development and testing within Google;
the talk looked at the project, its risks, its current status, and its plans.</description>

      <link>https://www.codeart.dk/blog/2021/10/optimizely-episerver-split-folder-structure-for-blocks-and-media/</link>
      <description>Since version 7 or 8 of Episerver (now Optimizely CMS), the shared Blocks and Media have been sharing the same folder structure. Some people see a benefit with the shared structure, and some absolutely hate it. Personally, I have gotten used to it - but I was recently asked if it&amp;#39;s possible to split it up. Here&amp;#39;s the hack I came up with.</description>

      <title>Enable search and notifications for email addresses using the &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; syntax</title>
      <link>https://haveibeenpwned.uservoice.com/forums/275398-general/suggestions/6774229-enable-search-and-notifications-for-email-addresse</link>
      <description>A lot of people use a syntax such as troyhunt+foo@hotmail.com where foo is a unique identifier for the site. They do this so that if they begin getting spammed, they can identify the source their email came from.

At the moment, HIBP treats this is a totally unique email address so if I&amp;#39;ve search for the parent email address without the &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; syntax, it won&amp;#39;t be found. This idea is to ensure that searches and notifications recognise the syntax and return addresses that are logically still the same account.

One thing HIBP would also need to do is specify which account alias was in the breach or paste. For example, I would want to know that it was troyhunt+bar@hotmail.com that was exposed in the XYZ breach.

Edit: Just to put the value of this into context, I&amp;#39;ve just run some stats on the Adobe breach. Of the the 152,989,508 rows in the dump, only 49,905 email addresses have a &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; in the address so that&amp;#39;s 0.03% of entries. That number is also a bit high as it includes junk entries. I&amp;#39;m definitely not ruling this idea out - it&amp;#39;s still planned - I just wanted to give a sense of how useful it would be.

Edit: To add to this idea, Robert&amp;#39;s comment about a period in the email is also very valid. I&amp;#39;d want to be very clear about the ubiquity of this practice across mail providers, but it&amp;#39;s certainly a good suggestion and worth further investigation.</description>

      <link>https://www.johnwhiles.com/posts/yikesscript</link>
      <description>Recently at work an seemingly innocuous dependecy bump caused a rash of typescript errors to appear throughout our code base. The changes seemed benign -  a new method in an internal library and a few dependabot updates to go with it. Nothing, it seemed, that should cause these errors:</description>

      <description>We present an extremely simple sorting algorithm. It may look like it is

other simple sorting algorithms, and analyse some of its curious properties.</description>
