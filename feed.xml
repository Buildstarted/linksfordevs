      <title>Ask for no, don’t ask for yes – Dan Moore!</title>
      <link>https://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/3518</link>
      <description>I think it is important to have a bias for action. Like anything else, this is something you can make a habit of. Moving forward allows you to make progress. I don’t know about you, but I’ve frozen up in the past not knowing what the right path was for me. Moving forward, even the smallest possible step, helped break that stasis.</description>

      <title>AI App Builders – Take 3 –&amp;#160;TempoLabs - Nick&amp;#39;s .NET Travels</title>
      <link>https://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/ai-app-builders-take-3-tempolabs/</link>
      <description>I was watching overview of TempoLabs and my initial impression was “wow, that’s a lot of stuff” as they not only have AI generation but it seems they understand at least the basics of a software devlelopment process. When you invoke the AI generation, it firstly parrots back its understanding of what you’ve asked for. ... Read more</description>

      <description>Years ago, I heard a stupid philosophy joke: a student taking an intro philosophy class asks the professor “but how do we know?”; then, when the professor gives an answer, the student asks “okay, but how do we know that?” This keeps on going until eventually the professor gets fed up and says “by looking”.</description>

      <description>At a recent MacSparky Labs event, a few folks started asking about career change—how to do it, when to think about it, and what it feels like to make a big shift. The questions hit home for me because, as many of you know, I spent thirty years as a lawyer before going full time... Continue reading →</description>

      <title>Claude as a video editor</title>
      <link>https://robertdruska.com/blog/claude-as-a-video-editor/</link>
      <description>Recently I wanted to speed up a demo video 10 times. Having minimum experience with video editing but convinced that such a simple action should be possible with a built-in Windows editor, I mindlessly searched &amp;quot;windows video speed up&amp;quot; on DuckDuckGo and clicked the first credible-looking result. According to the tutorial, the speed-up could be done in the native Photos app on Windows. Great!</description>

Clojure is not one of the handful of &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; mainstream languages. This means that sometimes people are surprised that we are all in on Clojure. Why go against the grain? Why make it</description>

      <title>Introducing AIBrix: Cost-Effective and Scalable Control Plane for vLLM</title>
      <link>https://aibrix.github.io/posts/2025-02-20-vllm-control-plane/</link>
      <description>Open-source large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA, Deepseek, Qwen and Mistral etc have surged in popularity, offering enterprises greater flexibility, cost savings, and control over their AI deployments. These models have empowered organizations to build their own AI-driven applications, from chatbots and agents to content generation and recommendation systems.
However, while these models are widely accessible, turning them into cost-efficient, production-grade APIs remains a significant challenge. Achieving low-latency, scalable inference requires more than just an optimized model—it demands a holistic system approach that spans multiple layers, from the model itself to the inference engine and the surrounding infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Why I&amp;#39;m Building a Context Pod</title>
      <link>https://jetwilliams.com/why-im-building-a-context-pod/</link>
      <description>From Google Docs to Plain Text I recently moved from using Google Docs to creating plain text files using TextEdit on my Macbook. I now have a simple content management system with all my files that lives on my desktop, and is backed up remotely using Github.
Some of my files include things like: watch lists, ideas, notes, journal entries, old writings and more. I was inspired to move over to plain text after reading a blog post by Derek Sivers, who gave me these four good reasons for doing so:</description>
