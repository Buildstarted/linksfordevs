      <link>https://mihaiolteanu.me/knowledge-based-society-my-ass</link>
      <description>I've studied the effects of electromagnetic
                    fields on patients with carotid stent implants during my PhD. I've
                    never talked with any patient nor seen any such medical devices even
                    to this day, fifteen years later.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs random?</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2025/04/26/llm-coin-toss-odd-even</link>
      <description>While LLMs theoretically understand “randomness,” their training data distributions may create unexpected patterns. In this article we will test different LLMs from OpenAI and Anthropic to see if they provide unbiased results. For the first experiment we will make it toss a fair coin and for the next, we will make it guess a number between 0-10 and see if its equally distributed between even and odd. I know the sample sizes are small and probably not very statistically significant. This whole thing is just for fun.</description>

      <description>Over the next couple of years, I'll be slowly moving away from Big Tech platforms and apps. In this post, I'll discuss why I'm doing this, and what it means in practice. This post is also an investigative exercise: what is my Big Tech footprint, and what are my alternatives?</description>

      <description>QWEN CHAT GitHub Hugging Face ModelScope Kaggle DEMO DISCORD
Introduction Today, we are excited to announce the release of Qwen3, the latest addition to the Qwen family of large language models. Our flagship model, Qwen3-235B-A22B, achieves competitive results in benchmark evaluations of coding, math, general capabilities, etc., when compared to other top-tier models such as DeepSeek-R1, o1, o3-mini, Grok-3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro. Additionally, the small MoE model, Qwen3-30B-A3B, outcompetes QwQ-32B with 10 times of activated parameters, and even a tiny model like Qwen3-4B can rival the performance of Qwen2.</description>

      <title>What the heck is AEAD again?</title>
      <link>https://ochagavia.nl/blog/what-the-heck-is-aead-again/</link>
      <description>Here’s a problem you might be familiar with: I keep forgetting what AEAD exactly means and why you would ever use it. Yes, I know the acronym stands for “Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data”, but does that really clarify anything? Not to me, so I’ve finally decided to sit down and write this blog post as a piece of help for my future self… and for anyone else who finds AEAD hard to retain.</description>

Finding one of those situations is exciting enough to motivate me to write an article about it!</description>

      <title>Is outbound going to die?</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2025/04/25/sales-outbound-ai-dead</link>
      <description>I see a ton of sales/marketing products all powered by AI, making hyper personalised content to target potential users and customers. These tools now make sophisticated, high-volume paid marketing campaigns accessible to everyone, from large enterprises to individual consumers. With LLMs, the messages and content have gotten to a point where the accuracy and quality of the has improved tremendously at scale. Moreover, the scale of outbound sales has also increased rapidly. You are now able to pump out 1000s of SEO blog posts, generate reels/videos on the fly and even use AI agents to do email/phone outreach at a never before seen scale.</description>
