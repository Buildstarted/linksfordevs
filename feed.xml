      <title>10 Most(ly dead) Influential Programming Languages • Hillel Wayne</title>
      <link>https://hillelwayne.com/post/influential-dead-languages/</link>
      <description>The other day I read 20 most significant programming languages in history, a “preposterous table I just made up.” He certainly got preposterous right: he lists Go as “most significant” but not ALGOL, Smalltalk, or ML. He also leaves off Pascal because it’s “mostly dead”. Preposterous! That defeats the whole point of what “significant in history” means.
So let’s talk about some “mostly dead” languages and why they matter so much.</description>

      <title>Letter to myself in late 2008</title>
      <link>https://dalton.substack.com/p/letter-to-myself-in-late-2008</link>
      <description>[I originally wrote and distributed this post to Y Combinator founders and have been encouraged to share it publicly, so here it is.] For context: in 2008 I was the founder/CEO of a company called imeem, which at the time had ~90 employees, good metrics, but high burn. I don’t think the 2020 crisis happening now is the same as what happened in 2008. But maybe the advice I wish I would have listened to in 2008 can help someone today.</description>

      <description>The world is upside down right now. We’re learning lots of new phrases like social distancing, contact tracing, and stop snacking just because you’re bored. Everyone around the world is coming together to do their part, whether that’s working on finding a vaccine, delivering food and supplies, or staying indoors. Whatever the case, all of our daily routines have been thrown completely out of whack. It’s easy to get scared at a time like this, which is why focusing on something can help you stay calm.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Depth Buffers</title>
      <link>https://miketuritzin.com/post/hierarchical-depth-buffers/</link>
      <description>Overview A hierarchical depth buffer is a multi-level depth (Z) buffer used as an acceleration structure for depth queries. As with normal texture mip chains, the dimensions of each level are generally successive power-of-2 fractions of the full-resolution buffer’s dimensions. In this article I present two techniques for generating a hierarchical depth buffer from a full-resolution one.
First I show how to generate the full mip chain for a depth buffer in a way that preserves depth query accuracy in texture coordinate (or NDC) space even for non-power-of-2 depth buffer dimensions.</description>
