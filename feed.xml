      <title>Thoughts on writing a wayland window manager with&amp;#160;wlroots</title>
      <link>http://inclem.net/2021/04/17/wayland/writing_a_wayland_compositor_with_wlroots/</link>
      <description>I recently released Vivarium, a dynamic tiling
wayland compositor built using the wlroots library.  Going from zero to compositing was interesting,
there are good libraries available but everything has moved very fast in the last couple
of years so it can be hard to know where to start. I especially wanted to write the
equivalent of an X window manager that only really cares about window layout and wants
everything else to Just&amp;#160;Work.</description>
