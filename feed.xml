      <description>Hi there &amp;#128075;

As you know or don&amp;#39;t know. I write for InfoQ, and I write 3-4 news coverage articles per month.

I am part of the .NET Content editors&amp;#39; team and each month; we write and cover new and exciting stuff in the #dotnet development world.

Last month, January 2024,</description>

      <title>Goodbye Non-KISS Appliances</title>
      <link>https://willbush.dev/blog/complex-appliances/</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yesterday, we gave away our ~6-year-old GE French-door refrigerator after a
never-ending slog of repairs. At least the guy and his mother who came to pick
it up have a side-hustle of repairing and reselling appliances. There&amp;#39;s hope it
won&amp;#39;t end up in a landfill. He offered to sell me a 4-door Samsung. No Thanks!
I&amp;#39;m done with over-complicated appliances. Refrigerator repair is not a skill
I&amp;#39;m looking to hone any further.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Don’t prefill config files</title>
      <link>https://www.makeworld.space/2024/02/no_prefill_config.html</link>
      <description>The biggest design mistake I made with Amfora, my first community open source project, was autogenerating config files. On startup, the application looks for a config file, and creates one if it doesn’t exist, full of all the application defaults. At the time, I thought this was great, as it documents all the existing options, and makes them very visible to the user in case they want to change them. In the end, this decision created a lot of headaches and is not something I’d ever do again.</description>

      <link>https://destevez.net/2024/01/trying-to-decode-lev-1/</link>
      <description>LEV-1 is a small lunar hopper that was carried by the SLIM lunar lander. It was released a few metres above the surface on January 19, as part of the lunar landing of SLIM. LEV-1 transmits telemetry in the 435 MHz amateur satellite band (it has an IARU satellite coordination approval), and also in S-band. Shortly after the landing, CAMRAS received the 437.410 MHz signal from LEV-1 using the 25 m radiotelescope at Dwingeloo. They have published a couple of IQ recordings in their directory of miscellaneous recordings (see the filenames starting by slim_).</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m trying to build a web application with typed functional programming. I am not trying to arrange the assassination of a political adversary.</description>

      <title>Vision Pro, unscrambled, is “I Poison VR”</title>
      <link>https://creativegood.com/blog/24/vision-pro-i-poison-vr.html</link>
      <description>Apple’s new face jail goes on sale today, a perfect moment to reveal the true meaning of the product. Vision Pro, unscrambled, is “I Poison VR.” We can see this clearly, if we just look at the device in the right way.</description>

      <title>Blogging in Djot instead of Markdown</title>
      <link>https://www.jonashietala.se/blog/2024/02/02/blogging_in_djot_instead_of_markdown/</link>
      <description>What if we weren’t chained to the past? What if we tried to create a light markup syntax that keeps what is good about Markdown, while revising some of the features that have led to bloat and complexity in the CommonMark spec?</description>

      <title>Why Isn’t the &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; Element 100% Supported on CanIUse.com?</title>
      <link>https://anderegg.ca/2024/02/02/why-isnt-the-html-element-100-supported</link>
      <description>I saw a Mastodon post that made me laugh this morning. It seemed sort of crazy that the html element wouldn’t have 100% support on CanIUse.com. Heck, I’ve been using it since 1994 and it worked just fine back then! This led me down a bit of a rabbit hole.</description>
