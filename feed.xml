      <description>An issue I see come up quite frequently, much to the chagrin of DI container maintainers, are problems of complex generics edge cases and how they come up in MediatR. In fact, more than one container author has demanded some kind of recompense for the questions received and issues opened</description>

      <title>On How Zero-Knowledge Proof Blockchain Mixers Improve, and Worsen User Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09035?cmid=8b2e57a6-094d-4530-8b3d-85ce95813d5d</link>
      <description>One of the most prominent and widely-used blockchain privacy solutions are
zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) mixers operating on top of smart contract-enabled
blockchains. ZKP mixers typically advertise their level of privacy through a
so-called anonymity set size, similar to k-anonymity, where a user hides among
a set of $k$ other users.
  In reality, however, these anonymity set claims are mostly inaccurate, as we
find through empirical measurements of the currently most active ZKP mixers. We
propose five heuristics that, in combination, can increase the probability that
an adversary links a withdrawer to the correct depositor on average by 51.94%
(108.63%) on the most popular Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
mixer, respectively. Our empirical evidence is hence also the first to suggest
a differing privacy-predilection of users on ETH and BSC. We further identify
105 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attackers leveraging ZKP mixers as the initial
funds and to deposit attack revenue (e.g., from phishing scams, hacking
centralized exchanges, and blockchain project attacks).
  State-of-the-art mixers are moreover tightly intertwined with the growing
DeFi ecosystem by offering ``anonymity mining&amp;#39;&amp;#39; (AM) incentives, i.e., mixer
users receive monetary rewards for mixing coins. However, contrary to the
claims of related work, we find that AM does not always contribute to improving
the quality of an anonymity set size of a mixer, because AM tends to attract
privacy-ignorant users naively reusing addresses.</description>

      <title>Researchers use tiny magnetic swirls to generate true random numbers</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2022-02-tiny-magnetic-swirls-true-random.html</link>
      <description>Whether for use in cybersecurity, gaming or scientific simulation, the world needs true random numbers, but generating them is harder than one might think. But a group of Brown University physicists has developed a technique that can potentially generate millions of random digits per second by harnessing the behavior of skyrmions—tiny magnetic anomalies that arise in certain two-dimensional materials.</description>
