      <description>Many years ago I’ve written somewhat similar piece about navigating all the distractions of my life. You can read it here: https://marcin.cylke.com.pl/2016/07/24/it-minimalist/
Years have passed, and I want to revisit the topic. Let this post be a reflection on how my habits changed, but also a summary of techniques that work for me right now.</description>

      <title>The YX Problem (Reverse XY Problem)</title>
      <link>https://yawn.io/posts/yx-problem-v2/</link>
      <description>XY Problem interactions go something like this:
Tess: How do I disable SELinux?
Burt: Don’t disable SELinux. Go and read https://xyproblem.info then ask your ACTUAL question.
Tess: My webserver is crashing with “can’t read /etc/foo.conf: permission denied”
Burt: You need to do chmod a+r /etc/foo.conf.
And yeah, fine, in this case Burt had a point. But what about this one:
Tess: How do I disable SELinux?
Burt: Don’t disable SELinux. Go and read https://xyproblem.</description>

      <title>I think we need a bigger boot partition... ｜ fernvenue&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.fernvenue.com/archives/i-think-we-need-a-bigger-boot-partition/</link>
      <description>Long ago, during the time of creation, I confidently waved my hand and allocated a 1GB ESP partition and a 1GB boot partition, thinking to myself with a confident smile that this would surely be more than enough for the foreseeable future. However, this foreseeable future quickly vanished along with my smile. What was bound to happen eventually came, but I didn’t expect it to arrive so soon. What could possibly require such a large boot partition? And how should we resolve this? Here, I would like to introduce the boot partition issue I encountered, as well as temporary coping methods and final solutions, mentioning the problems encountered along the way for reference.</description>

      <title>Using PBR to Route Traffic on OpenWrt ｜ fernvenue&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.fernvenue.com/archives/using-pbr-to-route-traffic-on-openwrt/</link>
      <description>Playing around with OpenWrt often involves multiple outbounds, maybe multiple ISPs or VPN outbounds like WireGuard. We always need to configure and route the traffic. Configuring routing can actually be a headache because as the needs become more complex, the difficulty of configuration tends to increase exponentially, also considering potential conflicts. Using ipset is certainly good, but the workload doesn’t diminish, it becomes greater sometimes. To address this need, I chose PBR, aka Policy-Based Routing, simplifying this complex problem with some simple configuration scripts.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Postgres Isolation Anomalies and How To Tame Them</title>
      <link>https://dansvetlov.me/postgres-anomalies/</link>
      <description>Postgres is a powerful and versatile database management system, now ubiquitously used in all types of applications. In the context of web services, its most important property is the ability to serve multitudes of users at the same time. This article explores how Postgres makes it possible by examining what can go wrong when transactions from multiple users interweave - it covers isolation levels and possible anomalies, along with ways to avoid them</description>

      <title>ESP32 WiFi superstitions | supakeen&amp;#39;s homepage</title>
      <link>https://supakeen.com/weblog/esp32-wifi-superstitions/</link>
      <description>The ESP32 is a popular microcontroller to use for do-it-yourself home automation, sensors, and a variety of other bits and bobs that you might want to take care of around the house. It’s the successor to the venerable ESP8266 which has found its way into many of our WiFi connected devices (seriously, open up a device and changes are relatively large that you’ll find one).</description>

      <link>https://shrsv.github.io/p/your-body-is-mostly-just-a-big-battery/</link>
      <description>I was recently reading Biohacking Lite by Andrej Karpathy, particularly the section called The Four Batteries of Your Body. For the first time in my life, health-related topics are starting to make sense to me because Karpathy explains them from first principles.
TLDR This is my TLDR after an hour of studying the topic. Any mistakes or misunderstandings are my own, and I may update this as my knowledge improves.

      <title>Milk Kanban</title>

      <description>Original meaning of Kanban is that it’s a visual signal. We tend to think about Kanban in terms of boards, columns, index cards, etc.  However, in principle, none of that is needed to design a Kanban system.</description>
