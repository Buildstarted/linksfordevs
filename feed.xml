      <title>David Swenson&amp;#39;s electrostatic &amp;quot;invisible wall&amp;quot; (1996)</title>
      <link>http://amasci.com/weird/unusual/e-wall.html</link>
      <description>echisholm 5/2016


Have a relative (sort of) who works at a 3M plant. Shit still occasionally 
happens.
&amp;gt; You can&amp;#39;t just say that and go away!! How are you not irresistibly 
&amp;gt; interested in that?? I would&amp;#39;ve interrogated that relative so hard
It just came up in passing at Thanksgiving! I don&amp;#39;t really know him 
that 
well; he&amp;#39;s an in-law. He mentioned being able to throw small washers and 
bolts at the field and watching them get repelled. People got 
interested, and so someone came with a voltmeter, and after throwing a 
couple more, they checked for voltage, and there was a residual charge 
after they finally caught on on a plastic sheet to prevent immediate 
grounding. It also had a very slight magnetic field. It&amp;#39;s apparently 
fairly common, but engineering hasn&amp;#39;t come up with a solid explanation 
why.</description>

      <description>Your WinForms code might have issues—maybe an Async call picked the wrong overload, or it’s leaking data into resource files. Time to call in a code-shrink! So, WinForms, Analyze This!</description>

      <title>Threads, Tasks, and Ownership: C# and Rust Concurrency Explored - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/threads-tasks-and-ownership-c-and-rust-concurrency-explored/</link>
      <description>Concurrency in programming can be like cooking dinner while answering emails—you’re juggling multiple tasks at once, hoping nothing burns. C# and Rust both tackle concurrency, but their approaches couldn’t be more different. C# offers a traditional multitasking toolkit with threads and async/await, while Rust rewrites the rulebook with a compiler-enforced, fearless concurrency model. Let’s see how they compare!</description>

      <description>Pretty much exactly a year ago, I posted about how I was trying out this
bcachefs thing, being cautiously optimistic (but reminding you to keep
backups). Now I&amp;#39;m going the other way; I&amp;#39;ve converted my last bcachefs
filesystem to XFS, and I don&amp;#39;t intend to look at it again in the near
future.</description>

Learn the fundamentals of Event Sourcing in .NET with this beginner-friendly guide. We&amp;#39;ll explore how to store your application&amp;#39;s state as a sequence of events rather than just the current state. Starting with core concepts, we&amp;#39;ll walk through modeling events, creating aggregates, applying events, implementing business logic, and building projections for efficient queries. Perfect for .NET developers looking to understand Event Sourcing patterns and their practical implementation. Code examples included.
