Dive into the future of API documentation in .NET 9 as we explore powerful alternatives to traditional Swagger UI. In this video, we&amp;#39;ll walk through implementing OpenAPI with three different documentation tools: Swagger UI, ReDoc, and the game-changing Scalar interface. Learn how to seamlessly integrate these tools with .NET Aspire, boost your API documentation workflow, and implement custom commands that will streamline your development process. Whether you&amp;#39;re a seasoned developer or just getting started with API development, this tutorial covers everything from basic setup to advanced integration techniques. We&amp;#39;ll demonstrate how to leverage these tools to create beautiful, interactive API documentation that your team and clients will love.

      <title>Optimizing with Novel Calendrical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://jhpratt.dev/blog/optimizing-with-novel-calendrical-algorithms/</link>
      <description>I have maintained the time crate for over five years now. In that time, tens of thousands of lines of code have been added, probably just as many removed, and countless more written but never committed. While benchmarks have been present for quite a while, I had never done one thing: truly optimize. Sure, some algorithms have been changed over the years, but I have never created a nontrivial date-time algorithm from scratch. The speed was good enough, even if it was slower than comparable crates.</description>

      <link>https://lgug2z.com/articles/my-first-month-selling-commercial-use-software-licenses/</link>
      <description>I made $901.49 in my first month selling commercial use software licenses.
This $901.49 came from 14 customers, 6 of whom purchased monthly license subscriptions and 8 of whom purchased annual license subscriptions.
January 2025 sales overview My most popular piece of software, komorebi, is a tiling window manager for Windows, published under an educational source license which does not permit any kind of commercial use.
At the beginning of 2025, I started offering dedicated individual commercial use licenses for people who want to use it at work.</description>

      <title>Best Simple System for Now</title>
      <link>https://dannorth.net/best-simple-system-for-now/</link>
      <description>You can have your cake and eat it, as long as you bake it carefully.
‘We can do this the quick way and pay later, or the thorough way and pay now.’ This seems to be a fundamental dichotomy in software development, between ‘perfectionism’ and ‘pragmatism’, but I do not think it has to be a trade-off at all.</description>
