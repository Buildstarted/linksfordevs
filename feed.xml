      <title>Which Projects Should Junior Devs Build? - Principal Software Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=5RZmwRJLRd4</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;m a junior developer -- Should I focus on TODO apps or try to build a business?

... Yeah, that about sums up the two major categories that I have coming in when this question is asked.

Many people have different opinions about this -- So of course, I have my own.

There are two major categories of things to build that I suggest, and each of them has different goals.

As with all livestreams, I&amp;#39;m looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.

      <title>Where Team Topologies Goes Wrong</title>
      <link>https://www.rheinnecker.de/blog/team-topologies.html</link>
      <description>Gartner places platform engineering almost at
                the peak of inflated expectations in their Hype Cycle for Software Engineering 2023. Senior architects
                and CTOs from companies big and small are touring conferences and meetups to evangelize how awesome
                their new internal development platform is.
                The new mantra is, &amp;#39;DevOps is dead; long live platform engineering.&amp;#39; What caused this
                trend, and why is it so successful, at least in its catchiness? Most talks and introductions about
                platform engineering base all of their arguments on the book Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton and
                Manuel Pais, published in 2019. According to Book Authority[1], this
                book is ranked among the &amp;#39;Best Product Management Books of All Time.&amp;#39; and is widely used by organizations
                worldwide to transform the way they work. By understanding and implementing these team topologies
                effectively, the authors&amp;#39; premise is that organizations can foster collaboration, reduce complexity,
                and accelerate innovation in their software delivery processes.</description>

      <title>Empowering Your Staff Doesn’t Work. Here’s What Does. – Klaus Breyer</title>
      <link>https://www.v01.io/posts/2024-empowering-staff-doesnt-work/</link>
      <description>There was a time when I managed some individuals who weren’t particularly independent. They were talented, no doubt, but hesitant to take action without my input. My solution? Empower them. Or so I thought.
I’d say things like, You’re empowered! Make the call! Take charge! But it never worked the way I hoped. They’d start a task, get partway through, and then ask for clarification—or worse, look for my approval. Frustrated, I found myself micromanaging to ensure things were done correctly. The cycle repeated endlessly: empowering them in words, controlling them in actions.</description>
