      <link>https://www.cazzulino.com/sponsorlink-feedback.html</link>
      <description>As I mentioned in my introduction post on SponsorLink, open source sustainability is a tricky topic.

      <title>Evolving the Game: A clientless streaming tool for reMarkable 2</title>
      <link>https://blog.owulveryck.info/2023/07/25/evolving-the-game-a-clientless-streaming-tool-for-remarkable-2.html</link>
