      <title>Default map value</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/default-map-value/</link>
      <description>In this post, I’ll explain how to provide a default value when querying an absent key in a hash map in different programming languages.   Java   Let’s start with Java, my first professional programming language.   In older versions, retrieving a value from a map required using the get() method:    Map map = new HashMap();                                 (1) Object value = map.get(new Object());                    (2) if (value == null) {     value = &amp;#39;default&amp;#39;;                         </description>

      <title>One-Year RSU Grants are for Suckers or Quantifying the Free Option Value of the Four-Year Varietal - Daniel D. McKinnon</title>

      <description>TL;DR Independent of the fact that stonks usually go up, equal-vesting, four-year RSU grants are worth ~26% more than their face value due to the embedded optionality and ~13% more than the equivalent one-year grant. I leave figuring out the … Continue reading →</description>

      <title>Building static binaries in Nix — kokada</title>
      <link>https://kokada.capivaras.dev/blog/building-static-binaries-in-nix/</link>
      <description>I recently had laser eye surgery for my near-sightedness, and while evaluating
if I could have the surgery I discovered that I was suffering from dry eyes.
Thanks to this, my ophthalmologist recommended that every 20 minutes while
using screens, I look somewhere 20 feet away for 20 seconds, a technique known
as 20-20-20 rule.</description>

      <title>Quote-unquote &amp;quot;macros&amp;quot;</title>
      <link>https://ianthehenry.com/posts/quote-unquote-macros/</link>
      <description>You’ve probably seen this Python 101 thing before:
@memoized
def fib(n):
    if n &amp;lt;= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
Leaving aside the absurdity of computing Fibonacci numbers recursively, it’s a common first introduction to Python decorators and higher-order functions. fib is just a function, and memoized takes that function and returns a new function (or something with a __call__ method) that, you know, memoizes the result.
Python’s decorators give us a nice notation for writing this, but we could write the same thing in any dynamic language with first-class functions. Like JavaScript:</description>

      <title>What&amp;#39;s Next? (2024 edition)</title>
      <link>https://tomaugspurger.net/posts/leaving-microsoft/</link>
      <description>I have, as they say, some personal news to share. On Monday I (along with some very talented teammates, see below if you’re hiring) was laid off from Microsoft as part of a reorganization. Like my Moving to Microsoft post, I wanted to jot down some of the things I got to work on.
Reflections It should go without saying that all of this was a team effort. I’ve been incredibly fortunate to have great teammates over the years, but the team building out the Planetary Computer was especially fantastic.</description>

      <title>async2 - The .NET Runtime Async experiment concludes</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/59752c38-9c99-4641-9853-9cfa97bb2d29</link>
      <description>The .NET team has been working on a new experiment called async2, which is a new implementation of the async/await pattern that is designed to be more efficient and more flexible than the current implementation. It started with green threads and ended with an experiment that moves async and await to the runtime. This post will cover the journey of async2 and the conclusion of the experiment.
