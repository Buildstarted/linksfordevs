      <title>From Chaos to Code: Migrating Legacy Infrastructure to Terraform - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/from-chaos-to-code-migrating-legacy-infrastructure-to-terraform/</link>
      <description>Raise your hand if you’ve ever inherited a mess of manually created cloud resources. Maybe your team has been clicking around in cloud consoles for years, and now your infrastructure is an unmanageable, undocumented monster. Or perhaps you have hundreds of resources, and nobody knows exactly how they were configured. Sound familiar? Don’t worry—Terraform can bring order to the madness!</description>

      <title>Self-Hosting a Firefox Sync Server</title>
      <link>https://blog.diego.dev/posts/firefox-sync-server/</link>
      <description>After switching from Firefox to LibreWolf, I became interested in the idea of self-hosting my own Firefox Sync server. Although I had seen this was possible before, I had never really looked into it—until now. I embarked on a journey to set this up, and while it wasn’t completely smooth sailing, I eventually got it working. Here’s how it went.
Finding the Right Sync Server Initial Search: Mozilla’s Sync Server Repo I started by searching for “firefox sync server github” and quickly found Mozilla’s syncserver repo.</description>

      <link>https://dmitryfrank.com/articles/indent_with_tabs_align_with_spaces</link>
      <description>When I was much younger, I used to use tabs in my code. After some time, I started getting headaches because the code gets messed up if some editor/viewer uses different tab size. For example, this is the code I wrote assuming tab to be 3 characters:</description>

      <title>Programming in wartime</title>
      <link>https://vlnn.dev/2024-05-16-programming-in-wartime.html</link>
      <description>My current hardware setup was planned during my onboarding at Apptopia (great company, BTW!) in the beginning of 2022. I’ve decided to try MacOS for the first time in my life (was a Linux user for ~15 years), and have bought myself a M1 Macbook Pro. This was a great decision, mostly not due to the MacOS bells and whistles, but rather due to great battery life and capable processing power, that both led me through the time of blackouts in the late 2022. I was able to more or less use the whole stack locally, building and testing monorepo in around 30 minutes (including all integration tests that were based on services like Cassandra, Apache Druid and Spark ran in Docker Compose infrastructure).</description>

      <link>https://fzakaria.com/2025/02/27/nix-pragmatism-nix-ld-and-envfs.html</link>
      <description>I have been daily driving NixOS for nearly a year on my wonderful frame.work laptop; and have been a Nix-enthusiast for ~5 years. Prior to NixOS, I primarily ran Nix atop my Debian distro, single-user mode, which worked suprisingly well. I loved the simplicity but I was blissfully unaware of how non-hermetic I was! &amp;#128561;</description>
