      <link>https://josephg.com/blog/rewriting-rust/</link>
      <description>The Rust programming language feels like a first generation product. You know what I mean. Like the first iPhone - which was amazing by the way. They made an entire operating system around multitouch. A smart phone with no keyboard. And a working web browser. Within a few months, we</description>

      <description>Hello &amp;#128075;&amp;#127995;

It&amp;#39;s Wednesday morning, a perfect time to sip your coffee while I talk about a topic dear to me. Sustainability.

More precisely Sustainability in hardware products.

10 months ago, two start-up founders went on stage and unveiled the Humane AI Pin.

      <title>The Watermelon Operator</title>
      <link>https://matklad.github.io/2024/09/24/watermelon-operator.html</link>
      <description>In these two most excellent articles,
https://without.boats/blog/let-futures-be-futures
and
https://without.boats/blog/futures-unordered, 
withoutboats introduces the concepts of multi-task and intra-task concurrency.
I want to revisit this distinction --- while I agree that there are different classes
of patterns of concurrency here, I am not quite satisfied with this specific partitioning of the
design space. I will use Rust-like syntax for most of the examples, but I am more interested in the
language-agnostic patterns, rather than in Rust&amp;#39;s specific implementation of async.</description>

      <description>I saw a post on Threads recently that is of a general genre of conversation I see on a regular basis. The first post was:

Just going on purely laptop tech reviews you would think 90% of the US population were employed as video editors.

Which got the reply:

      <title>TIL how to configure additional headers in Gitlab’s&amp;#160;nginx</title>
      <link>https://www.zufallsheld.de/2024/09/24/til-how-to-configure-additional-heades-in-gitlabs-nginx/</link>
      <description>Recently, I had to configure some security headers in GitLab. GitLab uses Nginx as its web server, and it allows for easy configuration changes for some settings. For instance, enabling HTTP to HTTPS redirection can be done simply by setting nginx[&amp;#39;redirect_http_to_https&amp;#39;] = true in the gitlab.rb configuration&amp;#160;file.

think of all of the software you&amp;#39;ve integrated with (libs, apps, APIs, etc).
Now, reduce that list of softwares to only those that you loved or that helped you non-trivially.</description>

      <title>What I tell people new to on-call</title>
      <link>https://ntietz.com/blog/what-i-tell-people-new-to-oncall/</link>
      <description>The first time I went on call as a software engineer, it was exciting—and ultimately traumatic.
Since then, I&amp;#39;ve had on-call experiences at multiple other jobs and have grown to really appreciate it as part of the role.
As I&amp;#39;ve progressed through my career, I&amp;#39;ve gotten to help establish on-call processes and run some related trainings.</description>
