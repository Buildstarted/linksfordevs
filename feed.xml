      <title>Transactions Across Data Stores</title>
      <link>https://petereliaskraft.net/blog/epoxy</link>
      <description>These days, it&amp;#39;s pretty common for a single application to use multiple data stores.
                            Sometimes, it&amp;#39;s because each data store is specialized for a particular task.
                            For example, an e-commerce site might use Postgres for robust customer data management, Elasticsearch for fast product search, and S3 for cheap image storage.
                            Other times, it&amp;#39;s because an app was built by multiple teams over time, so it ends up with one service storing customer data in Postgres and another storing customer data in MongoDB.</description>

      <title>Documentation Belongs in Engineering – Lennart Koopmann</title>
      <link>https://www.0x58ed.com/blog/documentation-belongs-in-engineering</link>
      <description>Many product companies start out with a very heavy focus on their engineering teams. At some point, many companies move the hosting and writing of documentation out of engineering and into a separate part of the company. It could be marketing, it could be customer success. This is a mistake.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Virtualization Metallize Libkrun Vsock</title>
      <link>https://taras.glek.net/post/lightweight-virtualization-metallize-libkrun-vsock/</link>
      <description>libkrun + krunvm
Github randomly recommended me libkrun
 which is a library backing krunvm
. It’s something similar to firecracker, but even simpler.
The most interesting feature there is:

“virtio-vsock (specialized for TSI, Transparent Socket Impersonation)”

AF_VSOCK
Linux/KVM AF_VSOCK is a way to avoid bridging and ethernet emulation for both performance and reduced attack surface. As far as I can tell only code mere mortals can use in a general way is to route over it is to use socat vsock support
.
Seems that libkrun implements a slirp-style network forwarded on kvm host side and I have no clue what they do inside kvm. If you figure that out, ping me on my socials.
Update: More info in twitter discussion
.
Embedding JITTED WASM in libkrun
HN completely ignored the story
 on how to marry above with WASM.
Why?

But there’s an scenario where Virtualization is not optional, and that’s when you want to protect the workload with Confidential Computing technologies such as SEV or TDX, as both of them are built on top of the existing Virtualization capabilities provided by the hardware.

Metallize
I once wrote a tool to make it easy to generate machine images using docker. I posted a re-implementation of that here: https://github.com/tarasglek/metallize

I need to make a really high performance networking setup to drive multiple 100G nics at max perf which required network namespaces, carefully setup subnets, cpu pinning, a custom fio, etc. Docker was the quickest way to iterate on those.
Apparently there is a way to do something similar using podman/buildah.
Conclusion
This set of technologies clicked together in my head from that random github recommendation. Writing these in a blog post in unlikely case this ever comes in handy.</description>

The sudo utility is one of the most common ways for engineers to cross the privacy boundary between user and administrative accounts in the ubiquitous Linux operating system. As such, its security is of the utmost importance.
The sudo-rs project improves on the security of the original sudo by:
  Using a memory safe language (Rust), as it&amp;#39;s estimated that one out of three security bugs in the original sudo have been memory management issues</description>

      <description>Now that interest rates are back at historically normal levels, bonds look a lot more interesting. Bonds let you grow your wealth and produce income while taking on modest levels of risk. “Modest levels of risk” is not the same as risk-free, of course. So let&amp;#39;s talk about some of the risks of buying and owning bonds.</description>

      <title>SOLID: Crafting Software To Conquer Complexity</title>
      <link>https://blog.sebastiansastre.co/article/solid-crafting-software-to-conquer-complexity</link>
      <description>In the realm of software development, crafting code that remains maintainable, flexible, and scalable stands as an utmost priority. And when delving into the concept of scalability, I&amp;#39;m considering not only the system&amp;#39;s load capacity but also your ability to maintain it, essentially wielding it as a tool to conquer complexity. To achieve this, developers often embrace design principles that steer them in writing this type of high-quality code. One such set of principles is known as SOLID, an acronym representing five essential tenets in object-oriented programming.</description>

      <title>No More Code Monkeys</title>
      <link>https://www.jerry.wtf/posts/no-more-code-monkeys/</link>
      <description>


In the fast-paced world of software engineering, an industry characterized by an average tenure between 1-2 years1, the notion of seniority has always been somewhat fluid. It is an environment where you’re expected to go from “new grad” to “senior” within 36 months, which presents a pace much faster than in most other professions. And yet, this swift movement through ranks, this very structure of seniority, faces disruption at the hands of emerging technologies, namely Language Learning Models (LLMs) like Copilot and ChatGPT.
The Changing Dynamics of Workflow
To understand the seismic shift that’s underway, you only have to ask the seasoned engineers in your team: has Copilot or ChatGPT had an impact on your workflow? Anecdotal evidence2 will tell you that in a vast majority of cases, these tools have indeed been revolutionary, despite the shaky early criticisms of Copilot. LLMs have the potential to churn out low-level code, provide debugging insights, and even advise on high-level architecture, amplifying productivity in an unprecedented way.
The immediate repercussion, however, is a trend toward hiring fewer interns and junior engineers. In a world where an LLM can augment the efforts of a mid-level or senior engineer so effectively, the traditional utility of the junior engineer  as a “code monkey” diminishes. The landscape becomes further treacherous for aspiring engineers, considering the spate of recent layoffs in tech companies.3 4 5</description>

      <title>Ruby Outperforms C: Breaking the Catch-22</title>
      <link>https://railsatscale.com/2023-08-29-ruby-outperforms-c/</link>
      <description>YJIT’s ability to improve performance by adapting to run-time behavior can increase the speed of our code in a way that dropping down to C can’t. As such, I think we should reconsider the common wisdom that “rewriting our Ruby in C” is the ideal path to performance optimization and take a serious look at “rewriting our C in Ruby” instead.</description>
