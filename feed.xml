      <title>My Troubles with MP3s</title>
      <link>https://disquiet.com/2021/12/29/my-troubles-with-mp3s/</link>
      <description>MP3s continue to be a source of confusion — consternation? apathy? entropy? all of the above? — for me. I should be clear that by “MP3s” I mean any fixed digital documents of audio. So, by “MP3s,” I also mean WAV files, and FLAC, and ALAC, etc. Actually, I specifically don’t mean WAV, because WAV files don’t play nicely with metadata, and files (at least cultural, third-party files) that don’t include self-explanatory contextual information seem inherently problematic. But in any case, I’m using “MP3” here as shorthand for fixed audio files that have contextual information (in this case, things like artist, title, album, year of release, etc.).</description>

      <title>A Culture Problem in Arch Linux</title>
      <link>https://opguides.info/posts/wtfarch/</link>
      <description>The Background #  I’m going to jump straight to the point, after my last post, somebody saw the Arch install guide on OpGuides and decided they didn’t like it, and so opened a PR deleting the file:
Now, this story could have ended here. I could have closed the issue and moved on with my life, but as a real “I use Arch BTW” user since 2014 I’m just not okay with this attitude in the community, so…</description>

      <title>Guidance for Scaling - Reversible vs. Irreversible Decisions</title>
      <link>https://www.craigkerstiens.com/2021/12/29/guidance-for-scaling-reversible-vs.-irreversible-decisions/</link>
      <description>Was having a conversation with a founder earlier today and the topic of hiring functional leaders came up. I offered one of my common pieces of advice which was don’t hold the reins too tightly once you hire them. It’s something I see happen over and over to first time founders. You hire a new VP of Product and then still continue to oversee so much of the product process yourself.</description>

      <description>C++/CX refers to Windows Runtime strings as Platform::String^ with a hat instead of a star. But even though the string wears a hat, it is not an Object^. The String^ type is a representation of the Windows Runtime HSTRING. And of the rules of HSTRING is that a null pointer is a valid HSTRING,</description>
