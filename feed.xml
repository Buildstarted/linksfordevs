      <title>Entity Framework Community Standup - Oct 14th 2020 - Cosmos DB: Repository Pattern .NET Wrapper SDK</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KenrBgNg8jk</link>
      <description>In this episode, fellow .NET TV host David Pine will join Jeremy Likness to discuss his Cosmos DB Repository pattern .NET SDK. The SDK aims to simplify the Cosmos DB .NET SDK by abstracting away some of the complexities, exposing an elegant API surface area, and providing C.R.U.D. operations through the IRepository interface.

As always, the EF Core team will be available to answer questions live.

      <title>A brief introduction to C++ structured binding | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201014-00/?p=104367</link>
      <description>C++17 introduced a feature known as structured binding. It allows a single source object to be taken apart: std::pair&amp;lt;int, double&amp;gt; p{ 42, 0.0 }; auto [i, d] = p; // int i = 42; // double d = 0.0;  It seems that no two languages agree on what to call this feature.</description>

      <title>Scaling HANGFIRE: Processing More Jobs Concurrently</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqVCQO42FFM</link>
      <description>Scaling Hangfire can be done in two ways: Increase the number of worker threads per server, or increase the number of servers.  You also need to be aware of the constrains of the underlying host.  That could be a Docker, VM, or a Physical Host.  Regardless, there are constraints of CPU and memory that you will likley need to look at to determine the right number of worker threads per hangfire server.  You can scale out further by deploying many hangfire servers on different underlying hosts.  Tip: Be aware of moving the bottleneck and be sure that downstream services can handle the extra load.

      <title>Learn C# with CSharpFritz - Ep 7:  The Errata Report No. 1</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFGfu7NTumI</link>
      <description>In this 7th episode of C# with CSharpFritz, Jeff goes back to talk about some of the language features that were skipped over the previous episodes.  We talk about increment operators, string formatting and interpolation, the continue statement, and the challenging discussion of what a struct is and when to choose a struct or a class in C# object design.

Interactive Notebook with samples you can run IN BROWSER at:  https://aka.ms/csharpfritz_notebooks_2020

After the C# basics sessions are completed, which user interface framework do you want Fritz to walk through FIRST?  Vote for your favorite with an emote at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/issues/13

Questions:
00:36:29 - Are anonymous functions possible in string interpolation?
00:38:40 - Can you write list.ForEach() statement in string interpolation?
00:59:24 - Do you need to use the &amp;#39;var&amp;#39; keyword when returning an &amp;#39;out&amp;#39; parameter?
01:07:52 - Can a struct bigger than the stack?
01:14:21 - Is there a C# 9 features overview stream scheduled?
01:19:09 - How is memory managed when you have List as a property of a struct?
01:20:43 - It seems like structs has lot of limitations. Can you please give an example of using structs?
01:46:39 - Can one property be static in a non static class?

      <link>https://joindiaspora.com/posts/7bfcf170eefc013863fa002590d8e506</link>
      <description>Propaganda, Censorship, and Surveillance are attributes of the same underlying aspect: Monopoly and Centralised Control.
All three problems have the same effective solution: Break up the monopolies.
Propaganda is a function of amplification, attention, audience capture, selective promotion, discovery, distraction, stealing the air supply or acquiring of any competion, and co&amp;#246;ption of the platform.  Propaganda is an inherent property of monopoly control.
Censorship and Gatekeeping are functions of excludability, audience gating, selective exclusion, obfuscation, distraction, stealing the air supply or acquiring of any competion, and, again, co&amp;#246;ption of the platform.  Censorship is an inherent property of monopoly control.
Surveillance whether of the state, capitalist, or non-state actor varieties, is a function of population and provider capture, coercion or gatekeeping of vendors and pipelines, and, again, co&amp;#246;ption of the platform.  Surveillance is an inherent property of monopoly c...</description>

      <title>Answering some basic questions about registering applications on Azure Active Directory</title>
      <link>https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/answering-basic-questions-about-aad-app-registrations/</link>
      <description>These past years I worked with a few companies that uses Azure Active Directory to perform authentication and authorization on their line-of-business (LOB) applications and from time to time I get questions about how to register apps on AAD.
Those questions are always pretty similar and most of the time the problem lies in some misconception, so I thought it might be a good idea to try to answer some of them and at the same time write them down in this post.</description>

      <description>In this article, you&amp;#39;ll see how frameworks like Entity Framework and MongoDB C# driver use expressions trees to make that conversion. And you&amp;#39;ll see how to use expression trees yourself to build dynamic queries. Those are queries that you aren&amp;#39;t able to create at compile time because you&amp;#39;ll know how the query should look like only at runtime.</description>
