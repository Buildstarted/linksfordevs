      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip336.html</link>

      <title>Responsible Tech Playbook</title>
      <link>https://martinfowler.com/articles/2021-responsible-tech-playbook.html</link>
      <description>Those of us developing software don’t need to be told what a big impact it’s had on humanity this century. I’ve long maintained that this places a serious responsibility on our profession. Whether asked to or not, we have a duty to ensure our systems don’t degrade our society. But in the tumult of so many software projects, it can be difficult to step back and understand the implications of our work. In the last few months my colleagues at Thoughtworks have been putting together a catalog of techniques that we can use to address this problem, which they published as the Responsible Tech Playbook.</description>

      <description>Investing in bitcoin (or any crypto with similar protocol) checks all these items.  The investors are all those who have bought or will buy bitcoins; they invest by buying bitcoins, and cash out by selling them.  The operators are the miners, who take money out of the scheme when they sell their mined coins to the investors.</description>

      <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mdkbobfo</link>
      <description>The updates to App&amp;#160;Store Review Guideline 5.1.1 last June provided users with greater control over their personal data, stating that all apps that allow for account creation must also allow users to initiate deletion of their account from within the app. This requirement applies to all app submissions starting January 31, 2022. We encourage you to review any laws that may require you to maintain certain types of data, and to make sure your app clearly explains what data your app collects, how it collects that data, all uses of that data, your data retention/deletion policies, and more as described in the guideline. Examples of this type of data include electronic health records, and sales and warranty records. Please also confirm that the app privacy information on your product page is accurate.

      <link>https://jonathanbgn.com/2021/09/30/illustrated-wav2vec-2.html</link>
      <description>Transformer-based neural networks have been revolutionizing the natural language processing field, but are only starting to become popular in the speech processing community.

I distinctly remember the first time feeling this, when the first person I ever hired decided to quit, which oddly felt like being dumped. I wish that wasn’t a part of the startup package. I consider myself lucky to never have experienced real anxiety before 30. And then I decided to start a startup. What makes startups fun is that there are so many huge challenges to overcome.

      <description>If you compile a simple C or C++ program, and then load it into the debugger as a dump file (or if you execute the program with ASLR disabled), you’ll find that the main function is at offset 0x00401000. What is so special about this address?</description>
