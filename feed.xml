      <title>Records Deep Dive: What, Why and How | NDC Melbourne 2021</title>
      <link>https://ndcmelbourne.com/agenda/records-deep-dive-what-why-and-how/7ffac16b0602</link>
      <description>Records were a new feature introduced in C# 9 that allow concise definition of immutable data classes that you may have already seen or even used. In order to support them there were also related new concepts introduced like &amp;quot;primary constructors&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;init accessors&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;with expressions&amp;quot;, and there are also some traps with records that you should be aware of, like for example I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t have referred to them as &amp;quot;immutable data classes&amp;quot;.</description>

      <title>Notes on Windows 11 - Jorge Pinto</title>
      <link>https://jorgepinto.neocities.org/_logs/20210720-notes-on-windows-11.html</link>
      <description>- I have no idea what Windows &amp;#39;Insider&amp;#39; means, I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m using a public beta, a Release Candidate or just a fake PR build. I honestly don&amp;#39;t know if this build is actually an ad. I don&amp;#39;t even remember how I became an &amp;#39;Insider&amp;#39; in the first place. Did I fill out a form years ago or is MS giving these licences away like candy with a shiny button to get free-pass on Early-Access shenanigans? Of course I could just read the build documentation but my point is I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to. They used to call these things alphas, betas, RCs, etc. for a reason. Windows 11 [/ VSC] &amp;#39;Insiders&amp;#39; means nothing. And it&amp;#39;s dumb. It&amp;#39;s like calling it Windows VIP (which admitedly, sounds kinda cool - better that &amp;#39;Insiders&amp;#39;, for sure).</description>

      <title>Syncing all the things</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/861978/</link>
      <description>Computing devices are wonderful; they surely must be, since so many
of us have so many of them.  The proliferation of computers leads directly
to a familiar problem, though: the files we want are always on the wrong
machine.  One solution is synchronization services that keep a set of files
up to date across a multitude of machines; a number of companies have
created successful commercial offerings based on such services.  Some of
us, though, are stubbornly resistant to the idea of placing our data in the
hands of corporations and their proprietary systems.  For those of us who
would rather stay in control of our data, systems like Syncthing offer a possible solution.</description>

      <title>The history of passing a null pointer as the key name to Reg&amp;#173;Open&amp;#173;Key&amp;#173;Ex</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210723-00/?p=105479</link>
      <description>For decades, the documentation for the Reg&amp;#173;Open&amp;#173;Key&amp;#173;Ex function said The lpSubKey parameter can be NULL only if hKey is one of the predefined keys. This statement was true when it was written. In 1992. For Windows NT 3.5, the behavior of the Reg&amp;#173;Open&amp;#173;Key&amp;#173;Ex function was revised so that passing NULL as the lpSubKey is equivalent to passing an empty string.</description>

      <title>Episode 20: Mark Rendle&amp;#39;s Stream of Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0020-markrendle/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Mark Rendle to chat about his experiences live-coding/streaming on Twitch! Warning: We went on a lot of tangents during the conversation! It’s all good though - as they were all awesome tangents! We not only talked about streaming, but also Blazor, C#, Unity, the rate of tech advancement, teaching kids to code, and much more!
  Mark’s Bio Mark Rendle decided he wanted to be a programmer when he was 10, became a professional programmer when he was 16, and is still a programmer 30 years later.</description>

      <title>Debugging JavaScript, DOM, CSS and accessing the browser console without leaving Visual Studio Code</title>
      <link>https://christianheilmann.com/2021/07/22/debugging-javascript-dom-css-and-logging-console-without-leaving-visual-studio-code/</link>
      <description>Now that Visual Studio Code has an in-built JavaScript debugger, it has become incredibly convenient to debug your project without leaving the editor. You can debug JavaScript, tweak CSS and the DOM and interact with the browser Console right inside VS Code. And you don’t need to know which extensions to install as the editor guides you along the way.</description>
