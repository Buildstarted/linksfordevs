      <title>37 Pieces of Career Advice I Wish I’d Known Earlier - RyanHoliday.net</title>
      <link>https://ryanholiday.net/37-pieces-of-career-advice-i-wish-id-known-earlier/</link>
      <description>From my first desk job working at my college newspaper. My first job was working at a small deli and grocery store in Lake Tahoe when I was 15. It was a job that came full circle some twenty years later when my wife and I bought a place called ​Tracy’s Drive-In Grocery​ in 2021, a little place that’s been in business since 1940. I’ve had my fair share of gigs in between. I worked in fast food. I was the director of marketing for a publicly traded company. I’ve been a lifeguard. I dropped out of college to be a research assistant to an author. I worked a desk at a talent agency in Beverly Hills. I’ve started multiple businesses. I’ve freelanced. I’ve been lucky enough to speak and consult with multi-billion dollar companies and Super Bowl winning sports franchises, family offices and law firms. I wouldn’t say I’ve done it all because that’s one thing you learn–how much you have left to learn–but I have done a lot. I’ve had to think a lot about how to be a good employee as well as how to be a good boss. I’ve seen what makes good companies succeed and bad companies fail. I’ve seen how people get ahead…and how people get stuff. I’ve also written a lot about this over the years, as I was figuring it out. In fact, many times I had to talk to bosses about this “little thing I do on the side” which was writing until eventually, the business stuff itself because of the stuff I do on the side. And now I have to have the conversation the other way with the people who work for me at ​Daily Stoic​ or ​Brass Check​ or at ​The Painted Porch​ or at ​Tracy’s​: Ok, but what do you really want to do and how can I help you get there? Anyway, this post is about that. The best of those lessons—things I wish I’d been told when I was just starting and things I still tell myself. Some of them might be exactly what you need to hear right now. Some might not apply to you yet, or ever. That’s okay. Whether you’re just starting out, looking to make a big change, or aiming to reach new heights in your current role, I hope you’ll find something here that helps you navigate your own unique path. Be quiet, work hard, and stay healthy. It’s not ambition or skill that is going to set you apart but sanity. I remember once I called Dov Charney, founder of American Apparel, about some little success I’d had on some project. He was very busy and frustrated that I’d interrupted, but politely, he said, “Ryan, you are calling me to tell me that you did your job.” I thought of that conversation when I saw that famous scene in Mad Men where Peggy complains that Don never says thank you. “That’s what the money is for!” he tells her. The thing that’s wrong about imposter syndrome is that for the most part no one is thinking about you at all. They’re too busy with their own doubts and their own work. When I was starting out as an assistant in Hollywood, someone told me that the best thing I could do was make my boss look good. Don’t worry about credit, they said. Forget credit so hard that you’re glad when other people get it instead of you. It ended up being pretty decent advice, but it was nowhere near the right wording. I think a better way to express it would be: ​Find canvases for other people to paint on​. Come up with ideas to hand over to your boss. Find people, thinkers, up and comers to introduce them to. Cross wires to create new sparks. Find what nobody else wants to do and do it. Find inefficiency and waste and redundancies. Identify leaks and patches to free up resources for new areas. Produce more than everyone else and give your ideas away. The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting. Very rarely have I ever let anyone go because they did not have the skills to do their job. It’s almost always their unwillingness to learn those skills or their inability to take feedback. When I was 20 years old, I was working at this talent agency in Hollywood, and I got invited to this important meeting. As they were talking about stuff, I interjected and said something. My mentor took me aside after and he said, why did you say that? Did you think it actually needed to be said or did you just feel like you wanted to have something to say? I think about that all the time. It’s in ​The 48 Laws of Power​ — Always say less than necessary. Saying less than necessary, not interjecting at every chance we get—this is actually the mark not just of a self-disciplined person, but also a very smart and wise person. The boss/mentor/biz can’t want you to succeed more than you want it. You have to be the driver of your own life/career/advancement. I was working full time at American Apparel but planning my next move, saving my money and thinking about writing a book. Over lunch one day, Robert Greene told me, Ryan, while people wait for the right moment, ​there are two types of time​: Dead time—where they are passive and biding and Alive time—where they are learning and acting and getting the most out of every second. Which will this be for you? When you’re lacking motivation, remind yourself: discipline now, freedom later. The labor will pass, and the rewards will last. When I first moved to Austin in 2013, I went out to lunch—fittingly—with a writer named Austin Kleon. I was a longtime fan of his book ​Steal Like an Artist​ (his book ​Keep Going​ is another favorite). After we ate, [...]</description>

      <title>Saved by NixOS Integration Tests, Surprisingly</title>
      <link>https://boinkor.net/2024/02/saved-by-nixos-integration-tests-surprisingly/</link>
      <description>Recently, tsnsrv has been getting a lot of high-quality
contributions
that add better support for Headscale and custom certificates, among
other things. As they always do when things change, bugs crept
in, and
frustratingly, not in a way that existing tests could have caught:
Instead of the go code (which has mildly decent test coverage), it was
bugs in the nixos module!
This was a great opportunity to investigate if we can test the tsnsrv
NixOS module, and maybe improve the baseline quality of the codebase
as a whole.
A recent blog post series on the NixOS test driver
(part1, part2) made the rounds
showing off what it can do, so this felt like a tractable project to
take on. Here’s my experience with it.</description>

      <link>https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/self-guided/</link>
      <description>CS 6120 is a PhD-level Cornell CS course by Adrian Sampson on programming language implementation.
It covers universal compilers topics like intermediate representations, data flow, and “classic” optimizations as well as more research-flavored topics such as parallelization, just-in-time compilation, and garbage collection.
The work consists of reading papers and open-source hacking tasks, which use LLVM and an educational IR invented just for this class.</description>

      <description>Landlords and property managers can’t collude on rental pricing. Using new technology to do it doesn’t change that antitrust fundamental. Regardless of the industry you’re in, if your business uses an algorithm to determine prices, a brief filed by the FTC and the Department of Justice offers a helpful guideline for antitrust compliance: your algorithm can’t do anything that would be illegal if done by a real person.</description>

      <title>Language Modeling by Estimating the Ratios of the Data Distribution</title>
      <link>https://aaronlou.com/blog/2024/discrete-diffusion/</link>
      <description>Modern large language models (like ChatGPT) learn to generate new samples by modeling the data distribution of natural text. However, the underlying methodology has largely remained stagnant over the last century: although different architectures have been developed, models are all based on autoregressive modeling (i.e. next token prediction). In this blog post, I will talk about our work on Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion models, an alternative probablistic modeling technique that achieves highly competitive performance (at the scale of GPT-2) while introducing distinct algorithmic benefits. Our empirical results challenge the longstanding dominance of autoregressive modeling and can potentially pave the way for an alternative class of language models built from radically different principles.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Geometric Algebra</title>
      <link>https://alexkritchevsky.com/2024/02/28/geometric-algebra.html</link>
      <description>I’ve been thinking about writing this post for a long time. Normally I haunt the comment section on Hacker News and whenever an article about GA comes up I post something to the effect of: “GA is okay but it’s not as good as those people say, there’s something wrong with it, what you really want is the wedge product on its own!” Which is not especially productive and probably slightly unhinged. So today I want to actually make that point in one central place that I can link to instead.</description>

      <title>Why and how I build terrible things</title>

      <description>Since wiping my Github over a year ago I’ve taken a much more, let’s say, impatient approach to my work.</description>

      <title>Next.js first impressions</title>
      <link>https://maged.com/nextjs-first-impressions</link>
      <description>I started a new web app recently and was surprised to see the official React documentation pushes users to Next.js when starting a new project.
This is crazy!
React is actively moving potential users away from using it directly and onto an abstraction layer on top of it.
The world’s most popular framework is willingly giving up that title.</description>

      <description>My friend Steve, N8GNJ and the editor of the Zero Retries Newsletter has been pitching ideas lately about how to grow the amateur service. It’s admirable and ambitious, but I generally avoid this issue because a) I have no viable solution to offer, and b) I don’t believe anyone else has one either. When it comes to growing the amateur radio service, I’m a fatalist. I believe ham radio will shrink until it’s gone. Given that, looking for solutions are a waste of my time.</description>
