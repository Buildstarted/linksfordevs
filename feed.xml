      <title>Create diagrams with code using Graphviz</title>
      <link>https://ncona.com/2020/06/create-diagrams-with-code-using-graphviz/</link>
      <description>Have you ever had to draw an architecture diagram and found the repetitive clicking and dragging tedious? Did you have to do modifications to that diagram and found it complicated?

Graphviz is an open source graph visualization software that allows us to decribe a diagram using code, and have it automatically drawn for us. If the diagram needs to be modified in the future, we just need to modify the description and the nodes and edges will be repositioned automatically for us.

Drawing graphs

Before we start writing graphs, we need to learn how we can convert our code into an image so we can test what we are doing.

      <description>This spring (2020) MIT moved all its classes online 
because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  It made available 
licenses for various nonfree programs, but I objected 
to them on grounds of principle.  For my class, an 
advanced class in computer programming, I made 
arrangements to avoid suggesting any nonfree software 
to my students.</description>

      <title>.NET Today and Tomorrow | Strangelights</title>
      <link>https://www.strangelights.com/posts/archive/2020/06/11/dotnet-today-and-tomorrow.html</link>
      <description>
Recently a conversation made me think about the current state of .NET. Someone from outside the .NET community asked me if .NET ran on Linux. The answer is that .NET has great cross platform support, running on Windows, Linux, maxOS, Android, iOS, WebAssembly, but I can see why someone from outside .NET might think that it didn't.

There are still a few nuance when it comes to cross platform support in the .NET world, but I think that's true of most development platforms today. This post aims to explain those nuances.

      <description>API versioning is a way to conform with the Postel's law. Jon Postel wrote this law in an early specification of TCP:

Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others
Jon Postel

This means that you must be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept. Once you have published a
version of your API, you cannot change the format of the data it sends to the clients.…</description>

      <title>The One About Managing Self As A Junior</title>
      <link>https://dariagrudzien.com/posts/the-one-about-managing-self-as-a-junior/</link>
      <description>Or How To Decrease The Load on Your Team.
 Throughout the years, there are things my mentors reported, and some that I observed both while hustling as a junior and managing a team in my past life, which help juniors contribute more, develop faster and save mentoring time (and mentors energy).
 Disclaimer: Reading this you may have a feeling that I disregard the role of the mentor, and the responsibility of seniors to share their knowledge with the team. I don’t—I think it’s a separate topic.
 Junioring 101 Ownership No matter how junior you are, and who is assigned to help you on the task, ultimately you are the owner of your task.</description>
