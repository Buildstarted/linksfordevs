      <title>Online Identity is Complicated | Eldridge&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.eldrid.ge/2022/08/12/online-identity-is-complicated/</link>
      <description>I am seeing increasing calls for real life identity to be a fundamental part of online presence, especially in places like Twitter where disinformation thrives. This is a problem.
Supposedly ensuring posts are connected to a real life identity will help prevent hate speech, disinformation, and scams. This proposal lacks crucial nuance. It falls into the trap tech always seems to fall into — pushing for major change without ensuring we have marginalized people at the table and in the discussion before we make major changes.</description>

      <title>ZeroBanana – Senior Engineers are Living in the Future</title>
      <link>https://www.zerobanana.com/essays/living-in-the-future/</link>
      <description>Imagine for a moment that, by some quirk of the universe, you are sharing your workspace with a time traveller. Specifically, yourself from 1 year in the future. How will you react to your new co-worker?1 [1 If you find this exercise difficult, try instead imagining how your past self of a year ago would react to your present self.] Despite being no more intelligent than you and coming from a similar background, they always seem to be one step ahead. Everything you accomplish, they have already accomplished a year ago.</description>

      <title>A pair of Rust kernel modules</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/907685/0290fbfe1ba855ea/</link>
      <description>The idea of being able to write kernel code in the Rust language has a
certain appeal, but it is hard to judge how well that would actually work
in the absence of examples to look at.  Those examples, especially for
modules beyond the &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot; level of complexity, have been somewhat
scarce, but that is beginning to change.  At the 2022 Kangrejos gathering
in Oviedo, Spain, two developers presented the modules they have developed
and some lessons that have been learned from this exercise.</description>
