      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/breaking-it-down-how-to-migrate-your-modular-monolith-to-microservices</link>
      <description>Transitioning from a modular monolith to microservices can significantly enhance your system&amp;#39;s scalability and your team&amp;#39;s productivity, but it&amp;#39;s a journey that requires careful planning and execution. In this practical guide, I&amp;#39;ll walk you through the key steps of this migration process, from preparing your monolith and selecting the right module to extract, to implementing effective inter-service communication and data migration strategies, all based on real-world experience with .NET applications.</description>

      <title>Types of investor misbehavior | ssaraf</title>
      <link>https://ssaraf.com/misbehavior/</link>
      <description>I recently completed a pre-seed fundraise for Partly [1], and I thought I’d share some of the negative experiences I had with investors. Most people who fail to raise money can’t share all the horror stories - they don’t want to burn bridges. And people who raise money easily (i.e. if they already have traction, or are in a hot area) often don’t see as much misbehavior. It’s folks in the middle that often have the best view of things.</description>

      <title>How iOS Restricts Features by Region: A Look at MobileGestalt and Eligibility</title>
      <link>https://type.cyhsu.xyz/2024/09/ios-feature-regional-lockout/</link>
      <description>Apple is a for-profit that is capable of and responsible for its own decisions of whether and how to comply. On the other hand, users can vote with their wallets. What’s more intriguing to me, though, is how Apple manages this growing set of regional feature restrictions.</description>

      <description>What if I told you that Forbes Marketplace, the affiliate company operating on Forbes.com ALSO had agreements with CNN and USA Today? And that Forbes Marketplace was stuffing those sites full of affiliate content just like it is with Forbes? And what if Forbes Marketplace went to extreme efforts to hide everything? I believe all this to be true. If […]</description>

      <description>Unless you have been living under a rock for the last few years, you probably have seen the same massive surge I’ve seen in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to pretty much every problem out there, in software testing, in software development, and in life in general.</description>
