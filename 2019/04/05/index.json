    "Description": "Have you ever asked “what is beyond the edge of the universe?” And have you ever been told that an infinite universe that has no edge? You were told wrong. In a sense. We can define a boundary to an infinite universe, at least mathematically. And it turns out that boundary may be as real or even more real than the universe it contains.\n\nCheck out the new Space Time Merch Store!\nhttps://pbsspacetime.com/\n\nSupport Space Time on Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/pbsspacetime\n\n#infinitity #edgeoftheuniverse #spacetime\n\nLearn More About Dark Energy Here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\nHosted by Matt O'Dowd\nWritten by Matt O'Dowd\nGraphics by Aaron Halevy\nDirecting by Andrew Kornhaber\n\nOur universe may be infinite. In order to wrap our puny human minds around such a notion we like to come up with boundaries. For example we have the “observable universe” – that patch that we can see, and beyond which light has not yet had time to reach us. It’s boundary is called the particle horizon. Beyond it there exists at a minimum of thousands and possibly infinitely more regions just as large. Our observable universe is like a tiny patch of land in a vast plain. We define its horizon like we might build a little picket fence around our little patch – meaningless from the point of view of the plain, but it makes our patch feel more homey and us less crushingly insignificant.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Big Bang, Quasar and Hypernova Supporters: \n\nBig Bang:\nAnton Lifshits\ncoolascats\nDavid Nicklas\nFabrice Eap\nJuan Benet\nJustin Lloyd\nTim Davis\n\nQuasar:\nJames Flowers\nMark Rosenthal\nTambe Barsbay\nVinnie Falco\n\nHypernova: \nchuck zegar\nDanton Spivey\nDonal Botkin\nEdmund Fokschaner\nJens Theisen\nJohn Hofmann\nJordan Young\nJoseph Salomone\nkkm\nMark Heising\nMatthew O'Connor\n\nThanks to our Patreon Gamma Ray Burst Supporters: \n\nAlexey Eromenko\nAndreas Nautsch\nAntonio Ruiz\nBradley Jenkins\nBrandon Labonte\nBuruk Aregawi\nCarlo Mogavero\nDaniel Lyons\nDavid Behtala\nDavid Crane\nDavid Schmidt\nDustan Jones\nGeoffrey Short\nGreg Weiss\nJack Frosch\nJames Hughes\nJames Quintero\nJinal Doshi\nJJ Bagnell\nJohn Webber\nJon Folks\nJonah\nJoseph Emison\nJosh Thomas\nKenneth F Leonard\nKevin Warne\nKyle Hofer\nMalte Ubl\nMark Vasile\nNathan Hitchings\nNicholas Rose\nNick Virtue\nRatfeast\nRichard Broman\nScott Gossett\nSigurd Ruud Frivik\nTim Crookham\nTim Stephani\nTommy Mogensen\nسلطان الخليفي"
