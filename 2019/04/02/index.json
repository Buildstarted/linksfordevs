    "Description": "C# 7.2 added the ability to mark a struct declaration as readonly. This has the effect of guaranteeing that no \nmember of the struct can mutate its contents as it ensures every field is marked as readonly. This guarantee is \nimporant because it allows the compiler to avoid defensive copies of struct values in cases where the underlying \nlocation is considered readonly. For example when invoking members of a struct which is stored in a \nreadonly field."

That dream has become a reality now that the IETF has standardized the ACME protocol as RFC 8555. I’d like to thank everyone involved in that effort, including Let’s Encrypt staff and other IETF contributors.\nHaving a standardized protocol for certificate issuance and management is important for two reasons. First, it improves the quality of the software ecosystem because developers can focus on developing great software for a single protocol, instead of having many pieces of less well maintained software for bespoke APIs."
