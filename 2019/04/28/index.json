    "Description": "In the previous posts of this mini-series I showed how to set up an ASP.NET Core 2.2 Application to connect to the Stripe API using Stripe.NET. At the end of the first post I had everything set up so that Products and Pricing Plans are automatically created at application startup if they do not already exist. In the second part I showed how to register a new customer with stripe, adding payment details and signing up the customer to a subscription. You can find the full post <a href=\"https://ml-software.ch/posts/stripe-api-with-asp-net-core-part-2\">here</a>."
