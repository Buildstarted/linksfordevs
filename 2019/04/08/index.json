No different than \ndiscussing the position of braces, tabs vs. spaces, etc ‚Ä¶ A meaningless distinction where there is no right answer, \njust finding a decision everyone can agree on. The debate between String and string though is not a simple \nstyle debate, instead it has the potential to radically change the semantics of a program."
