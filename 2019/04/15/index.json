What happens next? In fact, what happens straight after deployment, when you discover memory leaks, surprising crashes, performance problems, and other woes – in the production environment? The tools and profilers you're used to from Windows don't work on Linux, and a lot of them don't have easy-to-use alternatives. In this talk, we will review the current landscape of profiling and debugging .NET Core apps on Linux. We will talk about performance investigations using perf, the Linux performance multi-tool, which can collect stack traces of CPU samples and other interesting events from .NET Core applications. We will review LTTNG and how it's used by .NET Core as a replacement for Windows ETW events, and see how to collect LTTNG traces efficiently and extract useful insights from them. We will also talk about core dumps, how to generate them on Linux, and how to get .NET-specific information out of a core dump using lldb and SOS. Prepare for a bumpy ride of half-baked tools and command-line magic, with – hopefully – a rewarding end!"

    "Description": "Moore's Law may be dead, but CPUs acquire more cores every year. If you want to minimize response latency in your application, you need to use every last core - without wasting resources that would destroy performance and throughput. Traditional locks grind threads to a halt and are prone to deadlocks, and although actors provide a saner alternative, they compose poorly and are at best weakly-typed.\n\nIn this presentation, created exclusively for Scalar Conf, John reveals a new alternative to the horrors of traditional concurrency, directly comparing it to other leading approaches in Scala. Witness the beauty, simplicity, and power of declarative concurrency, as you discover how functional programming is the most practical solution to solving the tough challenges of concurrency.\n\nJoin next Scalar\nhttp://scalar-conf.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/scalarconf\n\nContact organisers:\nhttps://softwaremill.com/"
