    "Description": "A year ago at ScalaIO, John A. De Goes revealed the design of the Scalaz 8 IO monad in an epic standoff between Cats Effect and Scalaz 8 IO that became known as the #ClashOfIOs. Now, one year later, the ecosystem has been forever altered, as the event inspired other projects to adopt some of the Scalaz 8 design decisions.\n\nSince that date, the Scalaz 8 effect system has continued rapidly evolving. The system has been pulled out into ZIO, a standalone library with no dependencies. A new bifunctor design allows typed error handling; performance has been improved further; the error model refined to precision; the code battle-hardened; and new primitives have been introduced for composable, type-safe, leak-free, and high-performance concurrency.\n\nIn this presentation created exclusively for ScalaIO, John A. De Goes presents the latest work on finalizing the effect system. John takes attendees on a tour that reveals the beauty and the practicality of ZIO, and challenges attendees to embrace a functional way of solving the hard problems they encounter at work—without compromising performance or principles."
