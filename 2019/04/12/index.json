    "Description": "The last time anyone in Egypt wrote anything using hieroglyphs was in approximately AD 400. Yet even well before this date, at the height of the classical age, the writing system was known to virtually no one outside of Egypt. Certainly none of the ancient Greek or Roman authors, stretching back to Herodotus, had any idea how to read it. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, writing in the first century BC, could say only that it was “not built up from syllables to express the underlying meaning, but from the appearance of the things drawn and by their metaphorical meanings.” Thus, according to Diodorus, Egyptian hieroglyphs were what linguists refer to as an ideographic or logographic writing system: rather than representing the sounds of a spoken language, as in modern Western writing systems, each glyph stood for a thing, a being, an action, or a concept, as is partially the case in some Asian languages."
