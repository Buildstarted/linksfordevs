You have to rely on context or naming conventions or other weaker signals. You know, just like in dynamic languages like JavaScript. But the whole point of using a strongly-typed language like C# or Java is that you get compile-time checking that you're using the right variable in the right place for the intended purpose."

    "Description": "An Arduino Project (Using an Arduino Uno & Arduino Nano) that tries to keep a Ping Pong Ball bouncing with 4 mics.\n\nThe thing uses: \n- 2 Arduinos\n- 4 Stepping motors\n- 4 mics\n- stuff\n\nSome words about how it works:\nThe location is calculated from the time difference between mic pairs (one pair for each axis on the 2-dimensional plate). The noise from the ball hitting the plate is a very loud one; It was surprisingly easy to distinguish it from other sounds. You can talk casually nearby the machine and it won’t be affected.\n\nThere is a small analogue circuit to process the signals from the mics. Each mic sets a flip-flop (a thing to store a either a “1” or a “0”, digitally speaking) if it’s amplitude surpasses an adjustable voltage level. An Arduino Nano is watching all the flip-flops and resets them after they all got set (the blue LEDs in the video show the current flip-flop states). The Arduino checks the states as fast as possible, this allows for a reasonable accuracy. Another Arduino then uses this data to tilt the plate in such a way that the ball will – hopefully – not fall down. It uses a PID controlling approach for this.\n\nSome code:\nHere’s the Github repo with all the code for this project:\nhttps://github.com/T-Kuhn/Stepper-Juggler\n\nI made the data visualization on the left with Unity. It shows the data points gathered by the 4 mics. The plate is driven by 4 steppers.\n\nHere's a blog entry about the thing:\nhttps://electrondust.com/2018/07/22/stepper-juggler/"
