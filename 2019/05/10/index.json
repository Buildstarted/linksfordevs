    "Description": "When Jean-François Champollion died at the age of just 41, the nascent discipline of Egyptology lost much. The one man who had understood ancient Egyptian writing better than any other was gone before he had had the chance to put much of his knowledge down on the page — and he had likewise been denied the chance to amend and correct much of what he had recorded. With the one expert in the subject of Egyptian hieroglyphs no longer around to defend his work, it was all too easy to revert to the old mystical traditions of Hermes Trismegistus and Athanasius Kircher. Many of Champollion’s contemporaries, among them his old nemesis Edme-François Jomard, would never accept his findings. The new approach to ancient Egypt which Champollion symbolized would to some extent have to wait for the next, less hidebound generation of scholars to reach maturity and take positions of intellectual leadership."
