At the Scala Center, we have also reached out to many Scala community veterans, leaders, maintainers, as well as to the leaders of non-Scala communities for their advice and input. Even though the previous thread was useful as a feedback pool, we believe at this point it turned out to be a too long and unstructured conversation that is hard to follow and draw conclusions from.  We appreciate y..."

    "Description": "Where should we mark the beginning of the full-motion-video era, that most extended of blind alleys in the history of the American games industry? The day in the spring of 1990 that Ken Williams, founder and president of Sierra On-Line, wrote his latest editorial for his company’s seasonal newsletter might be as good a point as any. In his editorial, Williams coined the term “talkies” in reference to an upcoming generation of games which would have “real character voices and no text.” The term was, of course, a callback to the Hollywood of circa 1930, when sound began to come to the heretofore silent medium of film. Computer games, Williams said, stood on the verge of a leap that would be every bit as transformative, in terms not only of creativity but of profitability: “How big would the film industry be today if not for this step?”"

Request permissions from Publications Dept, ACM Inc., fax +1 (212) 869-0481, or permissions@acm.org. The definitive version of this paper can be found at ACM's Digital Library http://www.acm.org/dl/.We describe the design space for real-time photon density estimation, the key step of rendering global illumination (GI) via photon mapping. We then detail and analyze efficient GPU implementations of four best-of-breed algorithms. All produce reasonable results on NVIDIA GeForce 670 at 1920x1080 for complex scenes with multiple-bounce diffuse effects, caustics, and glossy reflection in real-time. Across the designs we conclude that tiled, deferred photon gathering in a compute shader gives the best combination of performance and quality.The following images and videos were produced after the paper was published and appeared in the presentation. All were captured in real-time on GeForce 670. The following images appeared in the paper:We thank our colleagues Jacopo Pantaleoni at NVIDIA and Guedis Cardenas at Williams College for their contributions to this project.Koguchi implemented a PS4 version of the tiled photon mapper which is available to PS4 developers in the SDK at ${SDK_PATH}\\target\\samples\\sample_code\\system\\tutorial_cpu_gpu_optimization\\GPU_photon_mapping\\.@inproceedings{Mara2013Photon, \n  author = {Michael Mara and David Luebke and Morgan McGuire}, \n  title = {Toward Practical Real-Time Photon Mapping: Efficient {GPU} Density Estimation}, \n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the {ACM} {SIGGRAPH} Symposium on Interactive {3D} Graphics and Games ({I3D'13})},\n  note = {Interactive 3D Graphics and Games 2013},\n  month = {March},\n  year = {2013}, \n  url = {http://casual-effects.com/research/Mara2013Photon/index.html}, \n  location = {Orlando, Florida},\n}"

This field of research has been able to solve a wide range\nof complex decision-making tasks that were previously out of reach for a\nmachine. Thus, deep RL opens up many new applications in domains such as\nhealthcare, robotics, smart grids, finance, and many more. This manuscript\nprovides an introduction to deep reinforcement learning models, algorithms and\ntechniques. Particular focus is on the aspects related to generalization and\nhow deep RL can be used for practical applications. We assume the reader is\nfamiliar with basic machine learning concepts."
