    "Description": "Back in 2017, Elon Musk had grand visions for the  test track built by The Boring Company, his tunneling firm, in Los Angeles. The Boring Company‚Äôs tunneling work was closely linked to Musk‚Äôs Hyperloop idea, which would require hundreds of miles of tunneling to be viable, although the actual test track in California bore none of the  traits of an air vacuum-based transportation system. It would have proprietary vehicles with varying capacities for private travel, public transport, or freight. They would travel along electrified skates for frictionless movement. It would be fast and efficient, but more importantly, it would be different, because he‚Äôs a genius."

It tries to bring longer form discussion of the cryptography engineering topics touched on @FiloSottile, but broader breath than those covered at blog.filippo.io. The goal is not to talk about what's new, but what's interesting, with enough space to elaborate on how things work. Also, it's a way to write more, so expect less polish than blog.filippo.io."

Ever since Gru was a little boy, he dreamed of going to the moon. Now, if Gru can just build a rocket and get his hands on a powerful shrink-ray, he can cement his reputation as the greatest thief who ever lived by stealing the Earth's satellite right out of the sky. But immediately after Gru heists the shrink-ray, the cunning super-nerd Vector (Jason Segel) swoops in and snatches it right out of his hands. Now, in order to claim the moon, Gru must first reacquire the weapon from Vector. Armed with the knowledge that his nemesis has a mean sweet tooth, Gru adopts cookie-selling orphans Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Agnes (Elsie Fisher), and Edith (Dana Gaier) and commissions a new line of cookie robots from the evil Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), his personal weapons specialist. But as Gru and his diminutive yellow minions prepare to carry out the biggest heist in history, something strange happens. Gru discovers that the three little girls who have come into his life are much more than simple pawns. They actually seem to care about Gru, and it turns out the scheming evildoer makes a pretty good father. When Gru realizes that his upcoming moon mission clashes with a ballet performance by the girls, he must decide what's more important -- being a present parent or cementing his nefarious reputation once and for all.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & ¬© Universal (2010)\nCast: Steve Carell, Miranda Cosgrove, Will Arnett, Elsie Fisher, Dana Gaier\nDirectors: Chris Renaud, Pierre Coffin\nProducers: John Cohen, Janet Healy, Christopher Meledandri, Sergio Pablos, Nina Rappaport, Robert Taylor\nScreenwriters: Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio, Sergio Pablos\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.
