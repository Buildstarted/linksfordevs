You\n    can customize how they work - both how they're displayed and how the the validation\n    rules work - using data annotation attributes. They're simple markers on the properties\n    that indicate which fields are required, what data type they are, etc. You can read more about\n        them on MSDN. Some common data annotation attributes are listed to the right\n    of the code."
