Take a listen, we may publish an English translation later (joking, Troy!). &nbsp; Highlights from this week's show include...  Troy gives a run-down on  We talk through some of the interesting use-cases for HaveIBeenPwned data Troy gives perspective on usernames, passwords, and other important things technology/security related  Guest  Troy Hunt (  ) - Troy is a&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;awardee for Developer Security, blogger at&nbsp;, international speaker on web security and&nbsp;. I created HIBP as a free resource for anyone to quickly assess if they may have been put at risk due to an online account of theirs having been compromised or \"pwned\" in a data breach. I wanted to keep it dead simple to use and entirely free so that it could be of maximum benefit to the community.
