And there's devices,\nwhere sometimes you can only read and write appropriately-sized blocks,\nnot individual bytes.  And then there's terminals, which are all sorts of\nweird.  But in all these cases, you've got a file descriptor, and when\nyou're finished you release the resource by calling the close(2) system\ncall."
