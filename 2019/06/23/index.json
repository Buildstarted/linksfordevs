There's\nsockets and pipes, which behave rather like files except that you can't\nseek on them and they have some extra metadata.  And there's devices,\nwhere sometimes you can only read and write appropriately-sized blocks,\nnot individual bytes.  And then there's terminals, which are all sorts of\nweird.  But in all these cases, you've got a file descriptor, and when\nyou're finished you release the resource by calling the close(2) system\ncall."
