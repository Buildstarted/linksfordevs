    "Description": "This problem started very recently for me and is not something I encountered before. When watching a video on chrome, say in YouTube, or Netflix, and I go to change the volume, see the usual volume bar, but accompanied with the volume bar is a translucent black box that says 'chrome.exe' with a play/pause and skip buttons. This is even the case if a video is paused in another tab or in the background. If i am not watching a video -- that is, the no tabs are open -- there is no box. See the pictures for more details on this phenomena."
