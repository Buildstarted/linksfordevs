    "Description": "The 2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition law protests are a series of demonstrations in Hong Kong demanding the withdrawal of highly controversial bill proposed by the HK Government. The amended law would permit extradition of criminal suspects to Mainland China and subject them to possible arbitrary detention, unfair trial and torture under China’s judicial system.\n\nThe June 9 protest organised by the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) was attended by an estimated 1.03 million people. Despite the widespread demonstrations, the government insisted on the amendment to pass. The second reading was originally scheduled on 12 June but was not held due to protests, and a scheduled meeting on the next day, 13 June, was also postponed. On June 15 the bill was postponed until further notice. A new protest has been scheduled for June 16 to get the bill completely withdrawn.\n__________\n► http://team-blacksheep.com\n► http://facebook.com/teamblacksheep\n► http://plus.google.com/+nastycop420\n► http://twitter.com/BlackSheepFPV\n► http://instagram.com/blacksheepfpv\n\nSUBSCRIBE ► http://bit.ly/TBSsubscribeYT\nJOIN THE LOUNGE ► http://bit.ly/TBSlounge\n__________\nADDITIONAL VIDEO AND AUDIO BY\n● Mark Delecate\n__________\nFLYING BY\n[tiny 3"

    "Description": "Modern branch predictors predict the vast majority of conditional branch\ninstructions with near-perfect accuracy, allowing superscalar, out-of-order\nprocessors to maximize speculative efficiency and thus performance. However,\nthis impressive overall effectiveness belies a substantial missed opportunity\nin single-threaded instructions per cycle (IPC). For example, we show that\ncorrecting the mispredictions made by the state-of-the-art TAGE-SC-L branch\npredictor on SPECint 2017 would improve IPC by margins similar to an advance in\nprocess technology node.\n  In this work, we measure and characterize these mispredictions. We find that\nthey categorically arise from either (1) a small number of systematically\nhard-to-predict (H2P) branches; or (2) rare branches with low dynamic execution\ncounts. Using data from SPECint 2017 and additional large code footprint\napplications, we quantify the occurrence and IPC impact of these two\ncategories. We then demonstrate that increasing the resources afforded to\nexisting branch predictors does not alone address the root causes of most\nmispredictions. This leads us to reexamine basic assumptions in branch\nprediction and to propose new research directions that, for example, deploy\nmachine learning to improve pattern matching for H2Ps, and use on-chip phase\nlearning to track long-term statistics for rare branches."
