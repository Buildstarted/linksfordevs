Multi-core CPUs have become the norm and multi-threading has been replaced by asynchronous programming. You think you know everything about async/await... until something goes wrong. While debugging synchronous code can be straightforward, investigating an asynchronous deadlock or race condition proves to be surprisingly tricky.\n\nIn this talk, follow us through real-life examples and investigations to cover the main asynchronous code patterns that can go wrong. You will tumble on deadlock and understand the reasons behind ThreadPool thread starvation.\n\nIn addition to WinDbg magic to follow async/await chains, Visual Studio goodies won't be forgotten to quickly analyze hundreds of call stacks or tasks status."

    "Description": "!!Con 2019- Tail Call Optimization: The Musical!! by Anjana Vakil & Natalia Margolis\n\n“Stack overflow”! “Maximum call stack size exceeded”!! “Too much recursion”!!!\n\nYou may have seen errors like these thrown when you attempt to run a deeply recursive function. Computers can be so dramatic! But what’s the conflict, exactly, between recursion and call stacks? And is there any hope for resolving it into a happy ending? In this musical talk we’ll see why recursion poses a problem for the finite-memory call stack in our language runtime (we’ll use a JavaScript engine as an example), and learn how “Tail Call Optimization” (TCO) - a particularly cool implementation feature of some engines - lets us get around that problem, when paired with so-called “tail-recursive” functions. We’ll sing our way through the meaning of these terms to explore how TCO messes with the call stack (in a useful way!), as we mess with the lyrics to some of our favorite animated musical songs (in a nerdy way!)."
