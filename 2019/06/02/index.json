    "Description": "Many executables include references (typically in a form of .pdb file name) to a program database path used by the software. This path typically points to some location on the software author’s system. I actually tried to cluster these paths in the past to build a list of account names used by malware authors. Of course, today it’s much harder – many modern malware authors randomize this path so it can evade signatures/yara rules."
