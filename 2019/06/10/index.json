The pass will analyze floating-point operations in a function and work out if there are any constraints on the range of these values, information which can be used to better optimize code."

Working together with lobbyists for big pharma and IP lawyers' groups, patent trolls are working on a bill that will destroy some of our best legal tools for fighting patent trolls.We're asking for your help: join Marc, and tell Congress that more bad patents won't help."
