It was built on a shoestring but quickly became the de facto standard for checking personal exposure on the internet and these days can see many millions of people in a day searching through many billions of records. I still run it on a shoestring but only because of access to new cloud technologies from Microsoft and Cloudflare. In fact, what I’ve found is that over time the service has actually become cheaper to run whilst supporting massively increased traffic loads and hosting more data than ever.\nClouds, Codes, and Cybers is a casual user group session that gives you a peek under the covers of how HIBP runs. I’ll walk you through the Azure constructs that make it possible, where I’ve failed and indeed where I’ve actually made some good decisions! You’ll see behind the scenes of not just the code that powers HIBP, but how the data is obtained and ultimately made publicly searchable. It’s a super casual session so come armed with questions and join me in Sydney.\nAbout Troy Hunt\nTroy Hunt, is an Australian Microsoft Regional Director and Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for Developer Security. He doesn’t work for Microsoft, but they're kind enough to recognize his community contributions by way of their award programs which he has been a part of since 2011. You'll regularly find him in the press talking about security and even testifying before US Congress on the impact of data breaches."
