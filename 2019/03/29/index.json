His father intended to make the strapping lad his gift to the church; he sent him to Rome to become a monk. But when Napoleon’s army arrived in the city in 1798, Belzoni’s extraordinary size and strength marked him for forcible conscription. Uninterested in becoming a soldier for someone else’s cause, he fled Rome and took to the road. For the next several years, he and his similarly imposing brother made their way as itinerant peddlers, traveling as far as Amsterdam in search of trade goods."
