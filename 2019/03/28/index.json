    "Description": "There are two basic methods for eating with a knife and fork. The “American” involves having your fork in your left and your knife in your right when cutting your food, then putting the knife down and switching your fork to your right hand to eat, tines facing upwards. (If you’re right-handed, that is.) With the “European” method, the fork remains in the left hand and the knife helps coax your food onto your fork. The tines remain facing downwards."

(OEIS A000793), and have been computed up to n=500000 by Grantham (1995). Landau showed that  lim_(n->infty)(ln[g(n)])/(sqrt(nlnn))=1.
