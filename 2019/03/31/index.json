    "Description": "On this episode of Blazor StateHasChanged we see how to deploy Blazor to both client and server using one shared code base. Using a shared code base provides extreme portability. With this model we could easily migrate from Blazor on the server to Blazor on the client with very little changes to any code.\n\n[4:05] Show begins - News\n[9:22] Watch me fail hard\n[29:25] New Project, we start our server shell apps project\n[43:30] Adding a Blazor Shell\n[55:24] Sharing code via Interface\n[1:44:20] Cors config\n[1:51:40] Northwind and EF\n\nBroadcasted live on Twitch -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/edcharbeneau"
