Of course, they've both lied when making up excuses. See this analysis from Sly Sparkane: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW_lIPdsWjY\nSee how Bob Knodel was exposed lying about his flight license: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjqOzimCz7A\n\nIf you are a flat earther: nope, the earth is not flat! You can clearly see the curvature in undistorted (!) amateur footage:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vGrZssA\nhttps://imgur.com/a/RacViFN\nSince the curvature is consistent, regardless of the camera's angle, it's proved that the curvature is not due to a fisheye lens. The overlay shows the theoretical expectation on a sphere with earth's radius, calculated with Walti’s horizon app: http://walter.bislins.ch/bloge/index.asp?page=Flat%2DEarth%3A+Finding+the+Curvature+of+the+Earth\nThe observation and the expectation match very well.\n\nFlat earthers claim that the horizon is "
