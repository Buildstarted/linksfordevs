    "Description": "The eastern side of the Giza Plateau is different from its counterparts in that it rises gently rather than abruptly from the surrounding desert. The Giza Sphinx lies near the point where it begins its ascent, approximately 1600 feet (500 meters) east of the Pyramid of Khafre. Like the pyramids, the Sphinx is perfectly aligned with the cardinal points of the compass, with its gaze directed due east across the Nile River and, today, the sprawling outskirts of Cairo. But unlike the pyramids, which were constructed out of stone blocks, the Sphinx was carved directly out of the bedrock of a natural depression on the plateau. The bulk of it thus sits in a trench that is itself below the level of the surrounding surface; this accounts for the Sphinx’s tendency to get buried under sand, and the resulting need to dig it out of its shallow grave whenever it has been neglected for too long. Such a process of burial and recovery has taken place again and again down through the millennia of the Sphinx’s existence."
