It is the largest international annual competition for autonomous service robots and is part of the RoboCup initiative. A set of benchmark tests is used to evaluate the robots’ abilities and performance in a realistic non-standardized home environment setting. Focus lies on the following domains but is not limited to: Human-Robot-Interaction and Cooperation, Navigation and Mapping in dynamic environments, Computer Vision and Object Recognition under natural light conditions, Object Manipulation, Adaptive Behaviors, Behavior Integration, Ambient Intelligence, Standardization and System Integration. It is colocated with the RoboCup symposium."

In my opinion, it’s one of the best visualization tools for performance profiles ever!\n\nSome time ago I have implemented SpeedScopeExporter which allows exporting any .NET Trace file to a speedscope json file format. It was released as part of 2.0.34 TraceEvent library a few months ago, but so far it was not available for the end users from PerfView GUI/command line level.\n\nYesterday, a new version of PerfView got released with the new possibility to export to speed scope file format. So now the PerfView users can use speedscope.app to view their performance profiles and take advantage of all the goodness it offers!"

Emails requesting donations from duplicitous charitable organizations are also common after tragic events.\n\n“Be wary of fraudulent social media pleas, calls, texts, donation websites, and door-to-door solicitations relating to the event.”\n\nHeightened emotions\n\n“Cybercriminals will always take advantage of terrorist attacks to exploit people financially,” Joseph Carson, chief security scientist and advisory CISO at Thycotic, told The Daily Swig.\n\n“These malicious campaigns will also attempt to steal login credentials and bank details to sell onwards to other cybercriminal groups.\n\n“The best way to avoid such scams is to go directly to official charitable websites and avoid clicking on suspecting links within emails or social media feeds.”\n\n“Heightened emotions are at the heart of what’s known as ‘social engineering’, where attackers exploit human nature,” added Adam Sheehan, behavioral science lead at MWR InfoSecurity, an F-Secure company.\n\n“When our emotions are heightened, we can be more vulnerable to malicious attempts at online influence.\n\n“Criminals will use the emotion of the recent tragedy to lower peoples’ guard. Beware of any emails, links, or webpages which may be exploiting your kindness and desire to help.”\n\nRELATED Warning issued over Hurricane Florence phishing scams"

I don’t have to do anything to make my app work in the US or Singapore or Kenya or anywhere else, and I didn’t make the Chinese government angry, so it should just work in China, right? Sadly, it’s not so simple. If your app/website servers aren’t hosted from within China, then, for all intents and purposes, it’s blocked. I mean, it will probably technically load, but will be excruciatingly, unusably slow. And sometimes it will just not load at all for hours at a time. This is true for all services hosted outside of the firewall, even in Hong Kong."
