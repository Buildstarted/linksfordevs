    "Domain": "www.trinityfarm.net",
    "Description": "The Icelandic Breed of Leadersheep were previously described as a rare sub-breed of the Icelandic Breed of Sheep, but recent physical, behavioral, and molecular research has led to the elevation of this unique group of sheep to full breed status.  They make up less than 0.5% of the Icelandic flock, and are distinguished by distinctive physical and behavioral traits that are genetically based.  There is evidence that they arrived in Iceland with the original settlers as they are mentioned in some of the earliest records, and over the centuries were selected for their intelligence and their ability to lead the flock, sense danger, etc., rather than for meat (brains not brawn!).  While no longer used as extensively on the farms as in the past, the sheep continue to lead the flocks, especially at the fall gathering. The numbers of leadersheep in Iceland have remained fairly constant for several decades, with approximately 1400 purebred leadersheep and approximately 500 \"hybrids\" - those sheep with between 50% and 99% leader genetics.  In appearance, leader sheep will be taller and thinner than the “typical” Icelandic sheep, and are generally solid colored with white socks and a blaze, although the badgerface pattern was formerly quite common. Leadersheep are highly intelligent: individual leader rams held by the Southram Breeding Center in Iceland are described as “calm and sensible,” “alert,” “gentle and eager to please people,” “eager to learn.”"
