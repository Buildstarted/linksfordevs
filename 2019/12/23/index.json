    "Description": "Visit our website to learn more! https://conf.dotnetos.org/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dotnetos/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dotnetosorg\n\nShay is a senior software engineering working in Microsoft's data access team, on Entity Framework Core, the .NET database API (ADO.NET) and other stuff. He is also the lead developer of Npgsql, the .NET open source driver for the PostgreSQL database. Shay is interested in all things performance - low-level and otherwise - and works hard to make .NET\nshine in various benchmarks.\n\nDeep dive into an ORM!\n\n.NET ORMs have a particularly complex and thankless job that few people fully understand - to translate user LINQ constructs into SQL; this talk will be a deep dive into Entity Framework's internals which handle this. We'll be discussing IQueryable providers, LINQ expression trees (which can be used to improve perf via code generation), the visitor pattern and the EF's internal architecture, some interesting and non-obvious mismatches between LINQ and SQL and how to overcome them, and some internal as well as user-facing techniques for making EF perform better. We will also focus on some aspects that make the new EF Core different from other ORMs."

His daily routine revolves around writing, designing and reviewing system code that runs with extreme performance and strict latency/jitter requirements. Dan applies his skills anywhere along the stack from low-level user-space networking to runtime-code generation and vectorization, compression\nalgorithms and more.\n\nWe will explore how developers can substantially improve performance by using CPU intrinsics, and go over the new support introduced in the recently released .NET Core 3.0. We'll see how performance hot paths can be rewritten to use intrinstics, discuss how CPU instruction pipelines work, and show how this knowledge can be leveraged to improve our performance profiles by orders of magnitude."

He’s\nworked with Azure, ASP.NET MVC and WinForms on projects for storing government weather\ndata, medical monitoring devices and an inspection system that ensured kegs of beer didn’t leak! He’s previously been an Open Source Contributor to BenchmarkDotNet and RavenDB, nowadays he mostly blogs about the internals of the .NET Runtime at www.mattwarren.org. Matt currently works on the Raygun APM Platform (raygun.com/platform/apm) and lives near\nPinewood Film Studios (home of James Bond) with his wife and 2 kids.\n\nWe often take the 'Common Language Runtime' (CLR) for granted and just let it get on with its job. But not only does it run our code, it ensures that it runs as fast as possible. In this talk we'll take a walk through the internals of the .NET Runtime, from a 'performance' perspective. Looking at some of the low-level tricks the .NET Core CLR does to make our code run as fast as possible. Covering Value Types, Method Calls, Tiered Compilation and more."
