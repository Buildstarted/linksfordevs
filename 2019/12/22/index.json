    "Description": "Most economists think of economics as a science. But are they right? If so, what kind of science is it? You can put on the uniform of a policeman, but does that make you a policeman?\n \nThese, and more questions, are answered in this fourth lecture in INET’s “How and How Not to Do Economics, with Robert Skidelsky.”\n \nINET sincerely thanks the Julis-Rabinowitz Family for their generous support, who named this series to honor the spirit of a great educator and economic thinker, Uwe Reinhardt.\n \nFor nearly 50 years, the late Uwe Reinhardt was a beloved economist and professor at Princeton University. Known best for helping to shape critical discourse around healthcare markets, his biting wit and intellect challenged students, colleagues, and policymakers alike to follow the data and to check all assumptions at the door.\n \nINET also thanks Rethinking Economics for their voices and contributions."

    "Description": "We have been working on a project for the last year and a half. As usual at Softwarepark, regular retrospectives have also been important in that project as they help us to reflect on how we are doing as a team, what works well and what can be improved. In this blog post we look at the practices we used and asked ourselves if we could make those implicit practices explicit and extract a “blueprint” of our project?"
