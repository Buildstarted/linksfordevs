Using this framework, we propose to swap out AES-GCM's\n$F_{2^{128}}$-based universal hash function for one based on VMAC, which uses\ninteger arithmatic. For architectures having AES acceleration but where\neither $F_{2^{128}}$ acceleration is absent or exists on the same execution\nunit as AES acceleration, an integer-based variant of AES-GCM may offer a\nperformance advantage, while offering identical security."
