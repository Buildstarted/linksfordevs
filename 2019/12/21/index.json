    "Description": "A television ad for Barclays Bank, seen in December 2017, featured a toy robot giving general website security advice. The robot character pointed to a website URL featuring a green padlock and stated, “…It’s a scam. If you order me you’ll get nothing. Right, before you pay, look for a padlock and always check the seller’s genuine. You don’t want to get scammed by a fake site …”."

Azure Image Builder is Microsoft’s answer to providing a “native” way to build virtual machine images in Azure. It is powered by Packer on the backend, but there are few nice features like the auto-deprovisioning and the handling of Windows restarts.
