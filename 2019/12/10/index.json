Computing and Information Systems degree at Goldsmith, University of London.\n\nThe camera take snapshots of the water surface at regular intervals and detects bubbles (circles) depending on the user-set Hough transform parameters. Bubbles are produced using two aquarium water pumps, the generation and location of which is assumed to be random; not replayable. The x,y location of the bubbles captured - the ones that fit the Hough transform parameters set - are saved as binary with the option to first whiten or condition the data stream using all or a combination of AES-128 encryption, XOR, and shuffling. True randomness was determined by running the streams of random bits through toolkits such as ENT, NIST-STS, DieHard and Rabigete.\n\nMy project was voted best submission for 2016!"
