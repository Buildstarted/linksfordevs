In this context the modern distributed applications need to securely access protected resources without having to share passwords.\r\n\nWe need scalable solutions that work with things like single page applications. We will dive in and explore terms like `OAuth`, `OpenIdConnect` and `JWT` and how they relate to authentication and authorisation.\r\n\nThis presentation hopes to give you a good understanding of what, where and how to get started with the modern approaches to authentication.\n\n---\n\nVideo Production Services: ZEROCUBE (https://www.zerocube.com.au)"
