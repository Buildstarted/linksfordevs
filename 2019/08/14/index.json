    "Description": "Spokesperson for the UN  High Commissioner for Human Rights:  Rupert ColvilleLocation: Geneva Date: 13 August 2019 \n      Subject: Hong Kong, China The High Commissioner is concerned by the ongoing events in  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong SAR) and the escalation  of violence that has taken place in recent days. \n       The High Commissioner condemns any form of violence or destruction  of property and urges everyone participating in the demonstrations to  express their views in a peaceful way. She notes the Chief Executive’s  commitment to “engage as widely as possible” and to “listen to the grievances  of the people of Hong Kong.” She calls on the authorities and the people of  Hong Kong to engage in an open and inclusive dialogue aimed at resolving  all issues peacefully. This is the only sure way to achieve long-term  political stability and public security by creating channels for people to  participate in public affairs and decisions affecting their lives. \n       The rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and the right  to participate in public affairs are expressly recognized in the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the International Covenant on Civil and  Political Rights which is incorporated in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR.The UN Human Rights Office has reviewed credible  evidence of law enforcement officials employing less-lethal weapons in ways  that are prohibited by international norms and standards. For example,  officials can be seen firing tear gas canisters into crowded, enclosed areas  and directly at individual protesters on multiple occasions, creating a  considerable risk of death or serious injury. The Office would urge the Hong  Kong SAR authorities to investigate these incidents immediately, to ensure  security personnel comply with the rules of engagement, and where necessary,  amend the rules of engagement for law enforcement officials in response to  protests where these may not conform with international standards.The Office urges the Hong Kong SAR authorities to act  with restraint, to ensure that the right of those who are expressing their  views peacefully are respected and protected, while ensuring that the response  by law enforcement officials to any violence that may take place is  proportionate and in conformity with international standards on the use of  force, including the principles of necessity and proportionality.

Just drop us an email at info@compositional-it.com!\nWho is this course for?\nF# developers looking to write full-stack web applications\n.NET C# developers who are looking to benefit from the power of F# as well from full-stack development, whilst reusing their .NET skills\nJavaScript & Typescript developers who are looking to retain benefits of the JS ecosystem but also benefit from F# and libraries that run on .NET\nElm developers who are looking for a similar development experience but to benefit from a full-stack development experience\nThis two-day course will guide you through all the steps required to develop reliable and scalable web applications using F#. Whether it's how to benefit from functional programming techniques in order to develop reliable applications and accurately model domains, working with standard web technologies such as JavaScript, WebPack and React whilst still working in F#, or how to write server-side applications that can seamlessly interoperate with client-side systems that work on the JavaScript ecosystem, you'll get something out of this fun and intense course.\nWhat will I learn?\nLearn about:\nF# as a language for writing end-to-end applications\nThe JavaScript ecosystem for front-end development\nHow to take advantage of the .NET ecosystem for server-side development\nThe Elm architecture\nAzure as a hosting and services platform\nYou'll learn the pragmatic techniques required to develop server-side and client-side web applications using idiomatic F# running on industry-standard tools and frameworks such as ASP .NET Core and Webpack, be taught the concepts required by expert trainers and have the opportunity to apply your learning through a combination of instructor-led slides, demos and hands-on labs.\nCourse Plan\nThe syllabus for this course is as follows:\nDay 1\nF# Primer: If you have little or no F# experience, we'll bring you up to speed on everything you need to know to take advantage of this course\nDeveloping web services: Discover how you can use the SAFE stack to build scalable web services using functional programming techniques powered by ASP.Net Core\nCompile your F# Code to JavaScript: See how F# can be used to run idiomatic F# code in the web browser\nDevelop your UI using functional programming concepts: Create maintainable applications using the MVU style of development\nDay 2\nType Safe CSS: Style your SAFE applications using F# and get all the benefits of F# type safety\nAuthentication: Learn how to allow your users to securely access your SAFE applications\nReactive Apps: Discover how SAFE simplifies the process of developing realtime web applications\nArchitecture: See how to scale your code as you add more new features\nAs part of our training, you will experience instructor lead lectures as well as hands on labs; at the end of the two days you'll have a fully-functioning web application as well as a pre-prepared version developed by us which you can take with you to study in your own time.\nCoaching Special Offer!\nAll attendees to this course also receive a free one-hour personalised post-training \"taster\" coaching session with one of the Compositional IT team. You can discuss how you plan to start using SAFE, get guidance from the experts, or show us some code you're working on for review. We'll make sure that you get your SAFE application off the ground in the best way possible.\nWho are Compositional IT?\nCompositional IT are a leading global F# and Azure consultancy, run by experienced consultants who specialise in functional-first, cloud-ready systems.
