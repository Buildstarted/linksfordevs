These proposals frequently focus on mental health, but a new plan before the White House to monitor “neurobehavioral” predictors of violence isn’t just misguided, it’s terrifyingly dystopian."

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nI ask myself, why should I focus on the negatives when there's so many positive things to say about Yemen?\n\nLook, there's no doubting that Yemen is undergoing some major problems like civil war, intense famine and excruciating poverty.   But when I take a second to look past that, this is truly an amazing country from the food to the historical sites and hospitality.  Yemen is capturing my heart like few countries ever have.\n\nPlease enjoy this video which shows off the good side of Yemen from my experiences in the country so far.  I really wish the media would have more stories like this in Yemen (and other countries like Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Iraq) -- don't you?!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for real time updates in Yemen: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/   \n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n►TW: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com"
