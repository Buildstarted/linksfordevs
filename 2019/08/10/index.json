    "Description": "Sometimes when we look at a polished interface we can acknowledge that it looks good but it’s hard to articulate why it looks good. In this practical session, Steve will be explaining the why. He’ll be looking at a poorly designed UI and refactoring it while providing some of the strategies and techniques designers use to give an interface that polished look.\n\nWe’ll be looking at some of the more common problems faced by designers and developers—from simple forms to complex data—showing what a difference a few small cosmetic changes can do to bring design to the next level.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/steveschoger/practical-solutions-to-common-ui-design-problems\nAbout Steve: https://www.steveschoger.com\nFollow Steve: https://twitter.com/steveschoger\nGet his book, Refactoring UI: https://refactoringui.com\nMore videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxqiDtkXtOCNJdckODHk9YA\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
