For our documentation site, we generate most of the content using Hugo and control access to content utilizing ASP.NET Core. From a user’s perspective, while navigating the site, they could see any number of HTTP status errors: 404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden, 500 Internal Server Errors. We wanted to make sure that not only a real user would see these errors, but crawlers and bots would see these errors in the response via HTTP semantics."
