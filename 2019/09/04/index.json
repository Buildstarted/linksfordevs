    "Description": "There is a vocal minority of desktop Linux user community that frowns at Microsoft’s involvement with the Linux kernel. These skeptics ignore the fact that these 'Microsoft' developers are “Linux developers” first and employee for some company second. It’s horrible when people question the intention and integrity of these committed developers. So, I asked Greg Kroah-Hartman - the maintainer of the stable branch of Linux - about his thoughts and he said exactly the same things. Microsoft is as committed to the success of Linux as are Red Hat, SUSE or Canonical. They all have vested interest in the success of Linux."
