    "Description": "A compiler translates a program written in a high level language into a program written in a lower level language. For students of computer science, building a compiler from scratch is a rite of passage: a challenging and fun project that offers insight into many different aspects of computer science, some deeply theoretical, and others highly practical."

ChocoPy is a restricted subset of Python 3, which can easily be compiled to a target such as RISC-V. The language is fully specified using formal grammar, typing rules, and operational semantics. ChocoPy is used to teach CS 164 at UC Berkeley. ChocoPy has been designed by Rohan Padhye and Koushik Sen, with substantial contributions from Paul Hilfinger."
