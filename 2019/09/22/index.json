    "Description": "Rainer Stropek, CEO at Software Architects\nTwitter: @rstropek\n\nSPA REVOLUTION WITH WEBASSEMBLY AND ASP.NET BLAZOR\n\nWebAssembly (WASM) is challenging JavaScript's monopoly in the browser. Many higher-level languages are currently evaluating whether WASM is a way for them to conquer the web client. .NET is spearheading this movement. In 2017, we saw the first .NET prototypes running on WASM. Based on that, Blazor, the new .NET- and WASM-based Single-Page-App (SPA) framework has appeared. The .NET community is thrilled but Blazor could be interesting for developers new to .NET, too. Rainer Stropek engaged early in the Blazor open source project. Join him in this fast-paced, demo-heavy session and see what's behind this new contender in the world of browser development."
