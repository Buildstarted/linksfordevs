    "Description": "Modern hard drives store an incredible amount of data in a small space, and are still the default choice for high-capacity (though not highest-performance) storage. While hard drives have been around since the 1950s, the current 3.5″ form factor (actually 4″ wide) appeared in the early 1980s. Since then, the capacity of a 3.5″ drive has increased by about 106 times (from 10 MB to about 10 TB), sequential throughput by about 103 times, and access times by about 101 times. Although the basic concept of spinning magnetic disks accessed by a movable stack of disk heads has not changed, hard drives have become much more complex to enable the increased density and performance. Early drives had tens of thousands of sectors arranged in hundreds of concentric tracks (sparse enough for a stepper motor to accurately position the disk head), while current drives have billions of sectors (with thousands of defects), packed into hundreds of thousands of tracks spaced tens of nanometers apart."
