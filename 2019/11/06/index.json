    "Description": "Many common document formats on the Internet are text-only such as email\n(MIME) and the Web (HTML, JavaScript, JSON and XML). To include images or\nexecutable code in these documents, we first encode them as text using base64.\nStandard base64 encoding uses 64~ASCII characters: both lower and upper case\nLatin letters, digits and two other symbols. We show how we can encode and\ndecode base64 data at nearly the speed of a memory copy (memcpy) on recent\nIntel processors, as long as the data does not fit in the first-level (L1)\ncache. We use the SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instruction set\nAVX-512 available on commodity processors. Our implementation generates several\ntimes fewer instructions than previous SIMD-accelerated base64 codecs. It is\nalso more versatile, as it can be adapted---even at runtime---to any base64\nvariant by only changing constants."
