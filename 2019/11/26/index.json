This project most inspired by Odroid Go and Pocketsprite, so why making new one despite buy one of them? Well, i know those devices are great and have well community support, but some of them had some issue that i don't really like. Odroid Go had shared it's spi for both display and sdcard, and they need patched esp-idf version for it and sdcard not work very well in spi mode, at least for my experience. Then pocketsprite only have esp32 wroom module without psram and also without sdcard support so limited portability for save my collection of games. Then i decided to design my own hardware based on both of them so i could port it's software to my own designed hardware then here i presented to you ESPlay Micro."
