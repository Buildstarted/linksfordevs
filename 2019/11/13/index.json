    "Description": "Originally, I was content in my job, happy even. But over time I grew to want more; more job satisfaction, more opportunities, more progression. I started working on making this possible at every opportunity; while I was in the office, nights, weekends, holidays ‚Äì ‚Äúhacking my career‚Äù to get more out of it whenever I had the chance. Eventually, I grew tired of my windowless office. I became frustrated with car spaces being assigned based on years of service. I didn‚Äôt like that in order for my career to ‚Äúprogress‚Äù, I had to give up doing what I loved. I hated my salary being determined by an Excel spreadsheet that was indexed against industry norms. I didn‚Äôt want to be an industry norm! So I changed it all, entirely independently and against most conventional wisdoms.\n\nIn this talk, I‚Äôll take you through my journey from a normal everyday corporate software job to complete independence. I‚Äôll share the things I did that made me happier and more productive whilst I was there, but also what I did to ultimately give me the choices in life to focus on the things I love doing in a post-corporate world. You‚Äôll see what worked well, what failed, the abuse I got along the way and ultimately, what the spoils of success look like today.\n\nThis talk is for everyone who wants to get more out of their technology career whether that be in their existing role or somewhere new in the future. It will inspire, motivate and guide you on how to get started on hacking your own career.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndc-london.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"

One almost completely overlooked feature that was\n        included in ASP.NET Core 3.0 was the introduction of a Razor Pages-specific\n        validation attribute that removes this reliance on MVC controllers or custom code for remote validation."
