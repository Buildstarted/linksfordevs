Even with the .NET Framework, some of the performance counters are far from being accurate. The best replacement solution is to rely on CLR Events to monitor the health of your applications.\n\nThis session will first show you how to easily build an accurate .NET monitoring of your applications based on CLR Events; including the Linux case for .NET Core.\n\nBeyond the monitoring use with .NET Core counters, Christophe will drive you into the implementation details to show you how these events can become invaluable during real world debugging and performance investigations.\n\nLast but not least, you will see how to leverage the new .NET Core EventPipe architecture to get accurate metrics about your applications."

With .NET Core, the profiler mechanism is extended to work on non-Windows platforms as well. In this almost demo-only session we’ll build a simple, yet functional, cross-platform .NET Core profiler and run it on Windows and Linux."

Here are the steps: In Excel or Google Sheets, select a range of cells and press Ctrl+C to copy. Paste (Ctrl+V) into the text box below to create a Markdown table. Additional Notes If your table is wide, the resulting text in the text box will appear to be wrapped and misaligned; however, everything will align properly when you copy it Read More"

    "Description": "The past decade has seen a remarkable series of advances in machine learning,\nand in particular deep learning approaches based on artificial neural networks,\nto improve our abilities to build more accurate systems across a broad range of\nareas, including computer vision, speech recognition, language translation, and\nnatural language understanding tasks. This paper is a companion paper to a\nkeynote talk at the 2020 International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC)\ndiscussing some of the advances in machine learning, and their implications on\nthe kinds of computational devices we need to build, especially in the\npost-Moore's Law-era. It also discusses some of the ways that machine learning\nmay also be able to help with some aspects of the circuit design process.\nFinally, it provides a sketch of at least one interesting direction towards\nmuch larger-scale multi-task models that are sparsely activated and employ much\nmore dynamic, example- and task-based routing than the machine learning models\nof today."
