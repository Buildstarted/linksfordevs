    "Description": "In the science fiction film Interstellar, a band of intrepid\nastronauts sets out to explore a system of planets orbiting\na supermassive black hole, searching for a world that\nmay be conducive to hosting human life. While the film legitimately\nboasts a relatively high level of scientific accuracy, it is still\nrestricted by Hollywood sensitivities and limitations. In this paper,\nwe discuss a number of additional astrophysical effects that may be\nimportant in determining the (un)inhabitable environment of a planet\norbiting close to a giant, accreting black hole. Foremost among these\neffects is the blueshift and beaming of incident radiation on the\nplanet, due to the time dilation of an observer orbiting very close to\nthe black hole. This results in high-energy flux incoming from\nsurrounding stars and background radiation, with significant\nimplications for habitability."
