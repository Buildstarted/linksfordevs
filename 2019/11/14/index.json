    "Description": "Talks for university students, hosted at MFF UK (Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University) in Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nhttps://karelz.github.io/events/events_2019-11-14_dotNet_Talks_at_Matfyz/\n\nUnfortunately, our streaming equipment failed us and we weren't able to capture slides. As a backup we used laptop integrated camera - hence the poor quality. Karel also live-tweeted the slides during the event: https://twitter.com/ziki_cz/status/1195049740444094465\n\n[5:30] Intro - Karel Zikmund\n\n--------------\n\n[12:28] ??? (No presentation name) - Miguel de Icaza\n\n--------------\n\n[49:00] C#: Life in a production compiler - Jared Parsons\n\nAbstract:\nToday in University you’re learning about LL(1) vs. LL(k) parsers, shiftreduce errors, reduce reduce errors, context free grammars, etc. How though do these lessons apply to production compilers with millions ofusers? Come hear about life on a compiler in the real world from Jared Parsons, lead of the C# compiler team. We’ll talk about how universityexperiences map to production, how the C# compiler is written and how we choose which features are added to the language.\n\nAbout speaker:\nJared is Developer on the C# compiler and member of the C# language design team. Has a strong passion for developer tools and infrastructure.\n\n--------------\n\n[1:26:47] Why managed memory is fooling us? - Konrad Kokosa\n\nAbstract:\nWe all have been fooled! They told us that automatic memory management will solve all our problems. In managed worlds like .NET, JVM and others there is no memory leak, they said. You will never need to think about freeing memory manually. There is no need to think about memory management at all, they said. And they all lied! Automatic memory management is a very convenient abstraction. Backed by tons of academical papers, it becomes an everyday programmers life. And as any other abstraction… it eventually leaks. In most unpredictable and unpleasant way. No matter what platform or language you use. So this is where theory meets reality and that’s why it is so fascinating!\n\nAbout speaker:\nKonrad is author of the Pro .NET Memory Management book. Independentconsultant, blogger, speaker and fan of Twitter. He also shares his passion asa trainer in the area of .NET, especially about application performance and diagnostics. Microsoft MVP. Co-founder of https://dotnetos.org initiative."
