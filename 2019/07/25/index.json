    "Description": "I have a chat with Troy Hunt, creator of Have I Been Pwned about developing your personal brand. Troy's answers to my questions can be related to anyone who is a public figure, even if it's a fraction of what Troy does such as blog or Twitter comments.\n\nNote: this chat was done over Skype for Business and is raw footage. I was using WIFI from the Portugal AirBnB I was staying in at the time and the first couple of minutes are not the greatest video quality for some reason. Sometimes it is a bit laggy. It is fine to listen to and have it play in the background while you multitask\n\nRead the full blog post here - https://benitezhere.blogspot.com/2019/07/developing-your-personal-brand-with-troy-hunt.html\n\n---------\n\nQuestions asked\n\n02:33 - What worked and what did not work for you along the way?\n\n05:33 - Tall Poppy syndrome exists\n\n10:56 - When you're well known, people may consider you or anyone else who has a high public profile as a celebrity. How do you remain intact in producing quality content to ensure that you are who you are, in terms of your knowledge and strengths and not just seen as a public celebrity\n\n16:25 - When you're writing your content do you endeavour to keep to a schedule or do you write whatever comes into your mind or what's happening during that week\n\n19:36 - With the content that you produce do you ever think about how to make it stand out or how to make it unique? As you know there's a lot of content that's getting written every week and there's more people out there who are starting blogs because technology in all fields is constantly evolving. Is it something you ever worry about it or you just shut it out and just mind your own content, and not worry about anyone else\n\n22:06 - For content that was previously relevant at the time, let's say you wrote a blog post five years ago and now because of the evolving technology that's taking place, would you go back and revisit it, would you leave it as-is or would you write a new blog post to expand on it? To outline what has since changed or why it would not work or apply anymore to this day?\n\n23:55 - Have you ever been called out by the 1% on something that you've written about in the past that's not relevant anymore? Has anyone in the last couple of years have been like - Hey Troy, by the way this thing you wrote back then is completely wrong \n\n25:06 - If you were the CEO or person in charge of LinkedIn, what would you do for a week in terms of changing it? \n\n---------\n\nFollow Troy on Twitter https://twitter.com/troyhunt\nSubscribe to Troy's blog https://www.troyhunt.com\nSubscribe to Troy's YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/user/troyhuntdotcom\n\nFollow me on Twitter https://twitter.com/benitezhere\nFollow my blog on https://benitezhere.blogspot.com\n\n#benitezhere #troyhunt"

And if the time is right, what are you actually supposed to do?\n\nIf you're interested to hear about a pragmatic approach to performance, this talk will explain when is the right time to think about benchmarking, but more importantly will run through how to correctly benchmark .NET code so any decisions made will be based on information about your code that is trustworthy.\n\nAdditionally you'll also find out about some of the common, and some of the unknown, performance pitfalls of the .NET Framework and we'll discuss the true meaning behind the phrase "
