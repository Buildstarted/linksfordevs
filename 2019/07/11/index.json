What are we getting wrong, how do we fix it and how do we stay on top in an environment which will be different again tomorrow to what it is today. It's a real-world look at modern defences that everyone building online applications will want to see.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
