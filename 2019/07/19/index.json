In the next version of ASP.NET, Core Razor is evolving into multiple Razor adaptations such as Razor Tag Helpers, Razor Pages, Blazor, and Razor Components . In this session, we'll learn the key differences between theses variations and see where they align in the ASP.NET road map. We’ll make sense of how each concept was introduced and what use cases they fulfill.\n\n[9:30] Show Starts\n\nTelerik UI for Blazor - https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui\n\n\nBroadcasted live on Twitch -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/edcharbeneau"

This tool records information about everything that happens in the build. But instead of just dumping everything into a huge text file it preserves the structure and relationships between elements, and lets you save and open the structured log in .xml format. This has significant advantages to help you understand and navigate large build logs.\n\nResources:\n\nDownload the viewer from http://www.msbuildlog.com\n\nMSBuild Structured Log on GitHub (https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog)"
