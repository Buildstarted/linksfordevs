    "Description": "Over the last year or so we have been building a new system that has an event-sourced architecture. Event-sourcing is a good fit for our needs because the organisation wants to preserve an accurate history of information managed by the system and analyse it for (among other things) fraud detection. When we started, however, none of us had built a system with an event-sourced architecture before. Despite reading plenty of advice on what to do and what to avoid, and experience reports from other projects, we made some significant mistakes in our design. This article describes where we went wrong, in the hope that others can learn from our failures."

    "Description": "If you're attending NDC you probably think you know what a foreach loop does - it iterates over a collection, right?\n\nWell... yes.\n\nBUT do you know how? Do you know what the C# compiler does when you write a foreach loop? What about a lambda expression? Or the re-entrant magic that is a yield return statement?\n\nIn this session we'll dive into Roslyn, the C# compiler, and learn about lowering and how it helps the compiler do its job, and what it does to your code. In the process you'll gain the skills to identify some of the common performance pitfalls of .NET, as well as just get a deeper understanding of what the code you write really does.\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks in the following links!\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcoslo.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
