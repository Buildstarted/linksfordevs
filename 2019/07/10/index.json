While we can gain increased insight into Windows activity, ETW was originally meant as a high-volume debug trace. Without some mechanism for filtering or reducing event volume, our SIEM won’t be able to keep up. In this post we will discuss the ways in which you can consume ETW and then talk about filtering and reducing event volume efficiently."

Because the .NET Core team was able to make minor breaking changes in the runtime and Base Class Library (BCL), lots of stuff was implemented much more efficiently. In this session Ben will dive into the performance improvements in .NET Core in the 3.0 release: runtime changes, JIT changes, intrinsics and a deep dive into some of the improvements making it the best release yet! \n\nThis session was recorded at:\n.NET Core Summer Event 2019\nJune 22nd 2019\nInfo Support HQ\nThe Netherlands\nhttps://www.dncse.nl\n\nThis event was sponsored by:\n\nInfo Support\nhttps://www.infosupport.com\n\nThe .NET Foundation\nhttps://dotnetfoundation.org/\n\nMicrosoft\nhttps://www.microsoft.com\n\nDotNed - .NET Usergroup NL\nhttps://dotned.nl/\n\nSeveral contributors on Open Collective\nhttps://opencollective.com/net-core-summer-event-netherlands\n\nIf you also want to contribute to make free events like this possible in the future, please donate on Open Collective.

In this demo heavy session I’ll show a sample of all these new tools that will be released with .NET Core 3 and how to use them.
