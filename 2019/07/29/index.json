    "Description": "Today’s guest is Daniel Roth, a Program Manager on the ASP.NET team at Microsoft. He works on building frameworks for web developers, including ASP.NET Core and Blazor. He has previously worked on various parts of .NET, including System.Net, WCF, XAML, and ASP.NET. And his passions include building frameworks for modern Web frameworks that are simple and easy to use. &nbsp; In this episode, Jeffrey and Daniel explore the world of Blazor DevOps! They take a look at the future potential of Blazor becoming the next desktop or native programming model, why you should use Blazor, the long-term vision for Blazor beyond what’s being released this year, and what the DevOps environment looks like for a Blazor server-side app (from a developer’s workstation all the way to running it and supporting it in production). Daniel also gives listeners his follow-up recommends on how to get started with Blazor and gives tons of practical tips if you’ve already gotten started. &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:40] Be sure to visit  for past episodes and show notes!

[20:04] A word from Azure DevOps sponsor: Clear Measure. [20:29] Has the architecture and design process already begun in conjunction with the Xamarin team at Microsoft? Has there been conversations around a collaboration with Xamarin and Blazor? And when will Blazor ship to .NET Core 3.0, WebAssembly, mobile, etc.? [21:56] Why .Net 5.0 is dropping the ‘Core.’ [23:07] What the DevOps environment looks like for a Blazor server-side app — from a developer’s workstation all the way to running it and supporting it in production. And what’s going to be different as developers store their code in source control. [35:45] What are the deployment options with Blazor?
