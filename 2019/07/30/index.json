    "Description": "In which John discusses The Mexican Repatriation of the 1930s, a story from U.S. History he learned about only recently. SOURCES:\n\nThe most comprehensive history of this period I found is a book called Decade of Betrayal by Francisco E. Balderrama and Raymond Rodriguez. It was there I first learned the story of Jose Lopez.\n\nThe wikipedia article about The Repatriation of the Great Depression-era is quite good: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Repatriation\n\nThe 2017 paper that found the deportations either has no impact on U.S. unemployment or else made it slightly worse: https://www.nber.org/papers/w23885\n\nThis NPR story connects some of the current concerns about immigration to the Repatriation: https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/09/08/437579834/mass-deportation-may-sound-unlikely-but-its-happened-before\n\nThis analysis found that a majority of the most commonly used U.S. history textbooks do not mention the deportations that occurred during the Depression: https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2006-04-04-history-books_x.htm\n\nI got the map in this video from this page that is also a good introduction to the land annexation that happened due to the Mexican-American War and the Gadsden Purchase: http://www.thomaslegion.net/americancivilwar/mexicancessionlessonstudentsandkids.html\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org"
