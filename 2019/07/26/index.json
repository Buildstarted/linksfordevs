    "Description": "With both the first edition in 2001 and the second edition in 2008, I\nput six chapters online for free at once, then added the others four\nyears after publication.\nFor the third edition, I've negotiated an agreement with the publisher\nto put the chapters online for review as I write them. So the book\nwill come out by instalments, like Dickens' novels. Once the\nmanuscript's finished and goes to press, all except seven sample\nchapters will disappear for a commercial period of 42 months. I'm\nafraid the publishers insist on that. But therearefter the whole book\nwill be free online forever."
