    "Description": "Your Tests Lack Vision: Adding Eyes to Your Automation Framework\nAutomation has come a long way in assisting with regression testing efforts. Teams worldwide are successfully running hundreds of functional regression tests at every check-in. While this provides a great source of confidence, critical regression bugs are still missed using this approach. That’s because these tests can only assert on what their human programmer asks them to. Additional errors with functionality, UX, and usability often go uncaught using today’s most common test automation techniques. \nFor this reason, the top companies in all sectors of the industry are turning to visual validation. Visual validation is a relatively new concept that can be used to enhance existing automated tests and provide an easy way to perform those difficult checks for things like UX, localization, usability, responsive design, and cross-device testing.\nIn this talk, you’ll learn how visual validation works, see a live integration into an existing test code base, and discuss the pros and cons of using various visual validation techniques.\n \nABOUT THE PRESENTER: ANGIE JONES\nAngie Jones is a Senior Developer Advocate who specializes in test automation strategies and techniques. She shares her wealth of knowledge by speaking and teaching at software conferences all over the world, as well as and leading the online learning platform, Test Automation University. As a Master Inventor, Angie is known for her innovative and out-of-the-box thinking style which has resulted in more than 25 patented inventions in the US and China. In her spare time, Angie volunteers with Black Girls Code to teach coding workshops to young girls in an effort to attract more women and minorities to tech.\n \nPROGRAM\n6:00 pm   Welcome networking with refreshments6:30 pm   Presentation followed by Q&A\n \n   \nTHANK YOU TO OUR YOW! NIGHT PARTNERS  \nYOW! Usergroup Partners     \nYOW! Gold Community Partner"
