    "Timestamp": "2019-10-16T05:45:45",
    "Domain": "dirkjanm.io",
    "Description": "One of the main powers of Office 365 is the tight integration between all the online applications. At the same time this is a risk since those applications have access to other elements such as emails in Outlook or files on SharePoint/Onedrive. This means that if there is a vulnerability (for example an XSS) in one of these applications, the impact may not just be the data stored in that application, but also impact other data stored in Office 365. This blog discusses a vulnerability Microsoft Teams that allowed an attacker to access emails and files stored in Office 365 when they could convince a victim to connect to a rogue (wireless) network. I disclosed this to Microsoft earlier this year and the issue was resolved this week. More apps may be vulnerable to these kind of issues so make sure to check your organization’s environment for similar issues."
