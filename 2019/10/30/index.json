While it’s not that big of a distance (only 2.5 hours of a drive, depending on border wait times), working remotely poses an interesting set of challenges and makes you re-assess your perspectives on collaboration."

    "Description": "A journey of multithreading using WebAssembly\nPresented by Boyan Mihaylov, at revo.js 2019\nhttps://revojs.ro/2019/speakers/boyan-mihaylov\n---\nWebAssembly is a new programming language, allowing us to compile C/C++ or other statically typed languages and run them in the browser and Node.js. While languages like C/C++ support multi-threading, JavaScript is single-threaded and this raises the question of how WebAssembly will behave.\n\nIn this talk we will discuss the design of threads for WebAssembly, the implementation challenges in terms of security and we will see examples of how multithreading can be achieved using Web Workers."
