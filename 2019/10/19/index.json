End-to-end test on web project are tests that automate a browsing session on a web browser. Most of the time it works by using API provided by an existing browser (like chrome). Those kind of tests have many drawbacks : Force you to add ids everywhere on your html code so you can find element on your test code Are often flaky because some load time might vary between two test run or you can change your front-end code without thinking about the changes needed in the test Are hard to build first because you can forget some steps, like scroll down or click here."
