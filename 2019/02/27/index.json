    "Description": "For eons, human beings have been collaborating and coordinating their activities towards some common goal -- moving from families to roaming small groups to towns and cities to institutions -- because of the ability to intermediate trust.\n\nBut thanks to the internet revolution, we're now able to collaborate at an entirely new scale…the only question is, how do we do this in a decentralized way, and scale trust without relying on middlemen? That's where cryptonetworks come in, and they're not just the next big revolution in tech, but are actually an evolution from where we've been, to where we are today, to where we're going. So in this talk -- originally delivered at a16z's annual innovation summit, which features invited speakers from various organizations discussing innovation and the evolution of tech trends -- a16z crypto partner Ali Yahya (formerly a software engineer and machine learning researcher at GoogleX and Google Brain) shares an overview of crypto... through the lens of the past, and future, of trust."

    "Description": "There are a lot of things that are next for deep learning. Instead of thinking of moving forward in one direction, think of expanding outward in many directions: Better reinforcement learning / integration of deep learning and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning algorithms that can reliably learn how to control robots, etc.Better generative models. Algorithms that can reliably learn how to generate images, speech, text that humans can’t tell apart from the real thing.Learning to learn and ubiquitous deep learning: algorithms that redesign their own architecture, tune their own hyperparameters, etc. Right now it still takes a human expert to run the learning-to-learn algorithm, but in the future it will be easier to deploy, and all kinds of business that don’t specialize in AI will be able to leverage deep learning.Machine learning for security, security for machine learning: more cyberattacks will leverage machine learning to make more autonomous malware, more efficient fuzzing for vulnerabilities, etc. More cyberdefenses will leverage machine learning to respond faster than a human could, detect more subtle intrusions, etc. ML algorithms from opposing camps will fool each other to carry out both attacks and defensive actions.Dynamic routing of activity will lead to much larger models that may use even less computation to process a single example than current models use today. But overall, massive amounts of computation will continue to be key for AI; whenever we make one model use less computation we’ll just want to run thousands of models in parallel to learn-to-learn them.Semi-supervised learning and one-shot learning will reduce the amount of data needed to train several kinds of models and make AI use more widespreadResearch will focus on making extremely robust models that almost never make a mistake, for use in safety-critical applications.Deep learning will continue to spread out into general culture and we’ll see artists and meme creators using it to do things that we never would have anticipated. I think Alexei Efros’s lab and projects like CycleGAN are the start of this."

    "Description": "Humans modify their facial expressions in order to communicate their internal\nstates and sometimes to mislead observers regarding their true emotional\nstates. Evidence in experimental psychology shows that discriminative facial\nresponses are short and subtle. This suggests that such behavior would be\neasier to distinguish when captured in high resolution at an increased frame\nrate. We are proposing SASE-FE, the first dataset of facial expressions that\nare either congruent or incongruent with underlying emotion states. We show\nthat overall the problem of recognizing whether facial movements are\nexpressions of authentic emotions or not can be successfully addressed by\nlearning spatio-temporal representations of the data. For this purpose, we\npropose a method that aggregates features along fiducial trajectories in a\ndeeply learnt space. Performance of the proposed model shows that on average it\nis easier to distinguish among genuine facial expressions of emotion than among\nunfelt facial expressions of emotion and that certain emotion pairs such as\ncontempt and disgust are more difficult to distinguish than the rest.\nFurthermore, the proposed methodology improves state of the art results on CK+\nand OULU-CASIA datasets for video emotion recognition, and achieves competitive\nresults when classifying facial action units on BP4D datase."

    "Description": "The success of deep learning in vision can be attributed to: (a) models with\nhigh capacity; (b) increased computational power; and (c) availability of\nlarge-scale labeled data. Since 2012, there have been significant advances in\nrepresentation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of\nGPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant.\nWhat will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10x or 100x? This paper\ntakes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the\nrelationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting\nthe JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we\ninvestigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this\ndata was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising\n(and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision\ntasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second,\nwe show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of\npromise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a\nbetter base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-the-art\nresults for different vision tasks including image classification, object\ndetection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is\nthat this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop\ncollective efforts in building larger datasets."

    "Description": "Speaker: Ben Gamari\nTitle: A low-latency garbage collector for GHC\n\nAbstract:\nAs real-time and distributed systems become common-place, latencies associated with memory management begin to limit the usability of garbage collected languages. In particular, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler has long relied on a throughput-oriented copying garbage collector; while this collector provides good memory locality for user programs, minimal fragmentation, and efficient collection, it imposes large latencies when collecting large heaps.\n\nRecent language implementations (e.g. Go, Mono, various Java implementations) have moved away from have avoided the problem of garbage collection latency through use of concurrent collection on a non-moving heap. In this talk Ben will provide a high-level overview of a concurrent, non-moving garbage collector implemented for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. This collector offers significantly improved pause times without the need for code recompilation and with minimal impact on program runtime. He will discuss the trade-offs implicit in the design, the challenges posed by collecting Haskell in particular, and present some preliminary performance measurements from a prototype implementation.\n\nRecorded at MuniHac 2018 / https://munihac.github.io by Maximilian Huber / TNG Technology Consulting GmbH"

And some of that is fair - there is a great deal of overly complicated stuff out there. But, in general, I've seen negative reactions to code that is simply dense, even if it's factored well. I've long been fascinated by how perceived time differs from actual time. In particular, humans are susceptible to believing that certain things are faster than others just because they feel faster. Consider the classic example of the MacOS mouse-based UI versus keyboard shortcuts. We've done a cool $50 million of R & D on the Apple Human Interface. We discovered, among other things, two pertinent facts: Test subjects consistently report that keyboarding is faster than mousing. The stopwatch consistently proves mousing is faster than keyboarding. This contradiction between user-experience and reality apparently forms the basis for many user/developers' belief that the keyboard is faster. Or consider automation versus just doing the grunt work. Taking this analogy back to programming with abstractions, consider two ways to add one to every element in a list. One uses the map abstraction and the other manually iterates with a for loop."

At first programming with it was painfully slow but, as I couldn't type, I persevered. After several months of vocab tweaking and duct-tape coding in Python and Emacs Lisp, I had a system that enabled me to code faster and more efficiently by voice than I ever had by hand.\n\nIn a fast-paced live demo, I will create a small system using Python, plus a few other languages for good measure, and deploy it without touching the keyboard. The demo gods will make a scheduled appearance. I hope to convince you that voice recognition is no longer a crutch for the disabled or limited to plain prose. It's now a highly effective tool that could benefit all programmers."

    "Description": "SIGIL™ is a free megawad for the original 1993 DOOM® created by John Romero. It contains nine single-player and nine deathmatch levels. The free megawad will be released in April 2019 and requires players own the original 1993 registered version of DOOM® in order to play. SIGIL™ is the spiritual successor to the fourth episode of DOOM®, and picks up where the original left off.\n\nYou can play SIGIL with several modern source ports such as GZDOOM, or the Steam version of DOOM. You must own the original registered DOOM or The Ultimate DOOM to play. SIGIL is playable in Co-operative, Deathmatch, and Single-Player modes. SIGIL is for PC/Mac.\n\nLimited Run Games has created fan boxes for physical distribution that will reach customers in April 2019. After the boxes have been shipped, the free SIGIL megawad will be available for download at https://SI6IL.com.\n\nUPDATE April 7, 2019: Due to a delay in physical production of some of SIGIL's pieces, fan boxes will ship in the first week of May. The free megawad will be made available one week after fan boxes begin shipping so paying customers can play SIGIL first."

Make sure to check the github for an up-to-date function reference! https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca\n\nThis video is the first in a multi-part series covering all the letters of the alphabet (each letter being a function) in the ORCA livecoding language! This episode covers all the basic math objects and also the handy-dandy jumpers! Apologies for the slightly clipped audio btw, it'll be fixed in future videos in the series.\n\nThank you so much for the awesome feedback and encouragement for the last video, I hope you enjoy this series - let me know if you have any questions and I'll respond as quickly as I can :)\n\nHave fun!\n\nNote for the curious - all functions which have a minimum and maximum (like R and I) work from the minimum to the maximum-1: so if you have a random with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 8, you'll get random numbers between 0 and 7, never 8.

    "Description": "Functional Scala by John A. De Goes\nFunctional Scala is an extensive 3 day course that may be attended remotely (Central European Standard Time) or locally (Nieuwegein, just outside of Amsterdam). The course rigorously instructs Scala developers on the most complex, confusing aspects of Scala, and shows them how to use the features of the Scala programming language to write rock-solid, bulletproof business applications that are easy to test, easy to reason about, and easy to change safely in arbitrary directions required by the business.\nIf you know Scala, but are confused by concepts and techniques in functional programming, or perplexed by advanced features of Scala’s type system, then this is the course for you. You will learn how functional programming enables Scala developers to build highly-scalable, concurrent, parallel, asynchronous, testable, and modular programs. You will discover how to program passionately and fearlessly, with confidence, and build and test scalable programs that are correct-by-construction.\nDay 1: Functional Essentials\nIn Functional Essentials, you will learn the foundations on which all functional programming in Scala is built: function composition, algebraic data types, higher-kinded types, and type classes. These topics can be very confusing to even experienced Scala developers, but properly explained, can provide a smooth gateway into the world of functional programming. By the end of the day, you’ll be confident in using ADTs and composition to solve real world problems, know why higher-kinded types are important to code reuse and how to use them, and understand how functional programs cleanly and simply abstract over data types.\nFunction Composition. In object-oriented programming, code can be reused, but implementation inheritance leads to the logic for an entity being scattered across a complex hierarchy. Functional programming provides a simpler, saner approach based on composition. You will learn how to use composition rather than inheritance to build larger pieces from smaller, self-similar pieces.\nAlgebraic Data Types. Many bugs in applications are caused by invalid data, which leads to edge cases, logic errors, and runtime exceptions. Functional programming provides Algebraic Data Types (ADTs), which allow you to precisely your domain in a way that eliminates these bugs. Equipped with a knowledge of ADTs and how they improve upon the \"record\" types found in other programming languages like Java, you will gain an ability to craft precise models of your domain that do not allow invalid states to exist.\nHigher-Kinded Types. In object-oriented programming, generics allow us to reuse code—for example, having a single sorting algorithm that can work with arrays of any element type. However, traditional OOP generics aren’t powerful enough to allow us to reuse higher-order logic. Functional programming provides Higher-Kinded Types (HKTs), which allow us to abstract over first-order abstractions (e.g. a collection-like data structure). You will understand why higher-kinded types are important to code reuse, and you will be able to pick apart and understand even the most complex higher-kinded type signatures.\nType Classes. The traditional object-oriented habit of mandating that classes extend certain interfaces results in tangled inheritance hierarchies that are hard to understand, and impossible to force onto third-party libraries. In functional programming, Type Classes provide an alternative way of adding structure to types, one that is easier to understand and works for user-defined and third-party data types alike. You will learn how to define and implement your own type classes so you can write generic code that works across user-defined and third-party data types.\nDay 2: Functional Abstractions\nIn Functional Abstractions, you will learn the core type classes used in functional programming, including some from abstract algebra and others from category theory. You will also learn about some of the powerful data types like lenses that help make functional programming better at stateful, effectful programs than procedural programming. By the end of the day, you’ll have a firm grasp on monads, functors, monoids, lenses, prisms, and traversals.\nAbstract Algebra. In object-oriented programming, many opportunities for code reuse go unnoticed, because common patterns do not come equipped with strong guarantees. In functional programming, monoids, semigroups, rings, fields, and other structures encapsulate common patterns of composition and combination, and can be used to solve many problems, especially in data processing.  You will learn the basics of abstract algebra and define instances of monoids and other structures for common business data types.\nFunctor Hierarchy. In object-oriented programming, design patterns like visitor, command, and dependency injection are used to describe common patterns. In functional programming, we can give names to common patterns and describe their behavior with structured type classes (instead of English prose) and generic laws, which lets us reuse more code and have a clearer idea of when code benefits from a certain pattern. The functor hierarchy, including everything from functor to applicative and monad and beyond, let’s us describe patterns of building data, changing data, and building programs to compute data. You will learn how to identify patterns that can benefit from various types of functors, including monads, and implement instances for practical data types.\nFolds & Traverses. In object-oriented programming, processing data is accomplished by writing lots of imperative loops. In functional programming, we can eliminate the duplication inherent to this style of programming, and focus strictly on the step of a loop, and its contribution toward the overall result of the iteration. This segment explores catamorphisms in the context of processing tree-like data structures, including lists, trees, and options. You will learn how to write clean, compact, and clear iterations using folds, and how to perform powerful of effectful loops using monadic traversals.\nOptics. In object-oriented programming, objects have getters and setters, which allow easy manipulation of data, but at the cost of local reasoning, because passing a data reference to any code anywhere means giving permanent read/write access to the data. In functional programming, a powerful construct known as optics (including lenses and prisms) allow us to preserve local reasoning and gain back not just easy data manipulation, but first class fields, which can be passed around and stored in data structures. You will learn how to manipulate deeply nested data in a first-class, functional, and powerful way.\nDay 3: Functional Effects\nIn Functional Effects, you will become an expert in using ZIO, a new library for building high-performance, leak-free Scala applications that are asynchronous and concurrent. Functional effect systems like ZIO include operations for safely acquiring and releasing resources, running tasks in parallel, racing tasks, forking tasks to run on green threads, interrupting forked tasks whose results are no longer needed, and joining forked tasks. By the end of the day, you will feel confident using ZIO either stand-alone or with Future or Cats Effect, and will have built your own purely functional application in a graduation project that ties together everything you learn in the course.\nEffects. In object-oriented programming, types say nothing about the behavior of a function, and detailed exploration of code is necessary to understand behavior. Functional programming solves these problems by turning effects into ordinary values, which allows types to describe behavior, and provides powerful ways of reasoning about and composing programs. You will learn how to describe any interaction with effectful systems using monadic effect types.\nAsynchronicity, Concurrency & Parallelism. In object-oriented programming, asynchronicity, concurrency and parallelism are extremely painful, because of the presence of imperative callbacks and shared mutable state, which leads to callback hell, deadlocks, thread leaks, and other massive pain points. Functional programming provides a more principled, sane model of asynchronicity, concurrency and parallelism, which makes developing asynchronous, safe, scalable programs trivial. You will learn how to write efficient (asynchronous) and performant code.\nResource-Safety. In object-oriented programming, the only primitive for resource safety is try / finally, which doesn’t work for asynchronous and concurrent programs, and can’t help avoiding thread-leaks. Functional programming allows us to increase the usefulness of try / finally across asynchronous and concurrent code, and across threads as well as file and socket handles. You will learn how to write programs that cannot leak resources.\nReal World Programming. In object-oriented programming, real world concerns include partiality, optionality, input and output, logging, bad user input, and so forth. Functional programming lets us handle all these concerns, with only pure functions, and in ways that provide strong benefits to local reasoning, testability, and modularity. You will learn how to solve the concerns of every day programming using the tools of functional programming.\nTesting & Mocking. In object-oriented programming, testing effectful code is difficult, often requiring strange mocking libraries that perform bytecode rewriting. Functional programming makes testing even the most effectful code trivial, without requiring any bytecode rewriting and still being completely typesafe.  You will learn how to thoroughly test effectful code with blazing fast unit tests that require no magic and are completely type safe.\nDaily Structure\n9:00 - Begin Instruction\n10:25 - Break\n10:35 - Resume Instruction\n12:00 - Lunch Break\n13:30 - Resume Instruction\n14:55 - Break\n15:05 - Resume Instruction\n16:25 - Break\n16:35 - Resume Instruction\n17:30 - End of Day\nVenue \nThe training course will take place at Big Data Republic. \nAttendance\nAttendance to Functional Scala is local or remote. Local attendees must arrange their own transportation and lodging to the host city, as well as their own food and beverages. Remote attendees will be provided with a link to a remote meeting session, in which they can see and hear the live workshop, ask the instructor questions, and chat with both local and remote attendees. Motivated remote attendees who participate in all exercises can expect to get nearly as much out of the training as local attendees.\nMaterials\nAttendees will be provided with example code, a course outline, and exercises in electronic form. The workshop is not recorded and recording is strictly prohibited. \nFinancial Aid \nFinancial aid is available for qualified applicants. If you would like to attend the training but cannot afford the list prices, please contact the organizer for information on all available aid packages."

Sometimes their complaint is about communications systems, like voice or messaging apps. Sometimes it's about end-user devices. On the other side of this debate is pretty much all technologists working in computer security and cryptography, who argue that adding eavesdropping features fundamentally makes those systems less secure."

She is also an Assistant Clinical Professor at Northeastern University in Boston. She obtained her PhD in October 2015 under Martin Odersky at EPFL, and is a longtime member of the Scala team, having worked on various aspects of Scala; from concurrency libraries to Scala dissemination and documentation.\n\nKeynote: We're Building On Hollowed Foundations: Worrying Trends in Open Source and What You Can Actually Do About It\n\nOpen source has won. As little as 5 years ago, the decision faced by many companies building software was whether or not to go with a proprietary database/language/operating system/etc or to choose the open source one. In 2017 we give this shift little thought; nowadays we simply reach for the open source compiler/database/operating system without even considering the closed source, proprietary choices. This is great! Or is it?\n\nAs we all happily jump on the open source bandwagon for project after project that we undertake, there are cracks beginning to form in some of the most important open source projects that we've all begun to depend on.\n\nOpen source is in fact in peril in many ways. In this talk, I'll show you a view of open source that you may be completely unaware of, and I will show you some ways that you, whoever you are, can jump in and help begin to build a better future for.\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/heather-miller"

    "Description": "Thimbleweed Park is an adventure game with a pixel art style perfect for cross stitch. Around the time of its spring 2017 launch, I stitched an homage to its five main characters as a gift for one of the game’s creators, Ron Gilbert. This game has a huge cast of creative characters, and while I was working on the original cross stitch I got the idea to make an afghan featuring all of them. As I finished each character, I posted a picture below along with the chart (free to download for personal use)."

verification of fast cryptographic software.\"\nAbstract:\n\nThe pursuit of performance\nhas produced a tremendous volume of critical cryptographic software.\nMany different cryptographic algorithms are in widespread use,\nwith many more implementations tuned for speed on different platforms.\n\nA tiny bug anywhere in this code base\ncan have disastrous consequences for security.\nFor example, Brumley, Barbosa, Page, and Vercauteren\nexploited a miniscule carry bug\nin the commonly used OpenSSL cryptographic library\nto steal an SSL server's entire private key,\nallowing easy interception and forgery of user data.\n\nStandard software-testing techniques catch many bugs\nbut did not catch further OpenSSL carry bugs\nannounced in January 2015 and December 2015.\nExpert audits caught these bugs but certainly have not caught all bugs:\nauditing is far too time-consuming\nto scale to the entire cryptographic code base,\nnever mind the question of whether the auditing is reliable.\n\nThis talk will present a successful example of a new strategy\nto integrate highly automated proofs of correctness\ninto real-world cryptographic software engineering.\nThis is joint work

you a sound track.\nThe government is recording everything,\nand this year announced that alternative music is a gateway drug to terrorism\n(see http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/25/radicalisation-kit-links-activism-and-alternative-music-scene-to-extremism).\nFortunately, Karen encrypted the email.\n\nFast forward to 2035.\nStasi 2.0 has risen to power,\nand has decided that, to protect society,\nanyone who has ever been exposed to alternative music\nwill be sent to a \"better place\".\nThey still have a copy of Karen's ciphertext.\nAnd here's the really bad news:\nthey've just finished building a billion-qubit quantum computer.\n\nBack in 2015,\nlarge general-purpose quantum computers haven't been built yet,\nbut the consensus is that they will be built,\nand that they will allow well-funded attackers\nto retroactively break practically all of today's deployed public-key cryptography.\nRSA will be dead.\nECC will be dead.\nDSA will be dead.\n\"Perfect forward secrecy\", despite its name, won't help.\n\nFortunately, there are replacement public-key cryptosystems\nthat have held up very well against analysis of possible attacks,\nincluding future quantum attacks.\nThis talk will take a hands-on look at the two examples\nwith the longest track records:\nnamely, hash-based signatures (Merkle trees)\nand code-based encryption (McEliece).\n\n\n\n2015.12.17 13:45\n105 minutes\ninvited lecture\nNetherlands\nlocal students\n\n[vertical PDF slides]\n[horizontal PDF slides]\nClass talk,

Are you sending the data\nthrough HTTP, or SMTP, or simply TCP, leaving it vulnerable to espionage, corruption, and\nsabotage by anyone who owns a machine connected to the same network?\n\nYou can use SSH and IPsec to protect communication with your own machines, but how do you talk\nto the rest of the Internet? You can use TCPcrypt to protect yourself against attackers too\nlazy to forge packets, but how do you protect yourself against serious attackers? You can use\nHTTPS for low-frequency communication, but how do you handle heavy network traffic, and how do\nyou protect yourself against the security flaws in HTTPS? Today's Internet cryptography is\nslow, untrustworthy, hard to use, and remarkably unsuccessful as a competitor to good old\nunprotected TCP.\n\nThis talk will present a different approach to high-security Internet cryptography. This\napproach is easy for users, easy for system administrators, and, perhaps most importantly,\neasy for programmers. The main reason that the approach has not been tried before is that it\nseems to involve very slow cryptographic operations; this talk will show that the approach is\nextremely fast when it is done

The underlying\n   problem is DNSSEC's fear of cryptographic overload, which forced\n   DNSSEC down a path of unreliability, insecurity, and unusability.\n\n   DNSCurve is a new project to add cryptographic protection to DNS.\n   DNSCurve is much stronger than DNSSEC, much more robust, much less\n   damaging to the Internet, much easier to implement, and much easier\n   to use.\n\n   The critical design decision in DNSCurve is exactly the decision that\n   DNSSEC rejected on the grounds of performance. Can busy sites keep up\n   with the load? Advances in high-speed high-security elliptic-curve\n   cryptography mean that the answer is yes. A single day of computation\n   on a Core 2 Quad CPU is enough to cryptographically protect 50\n   billion packets exchanged with 500 million clients, more than the\n   load on all of the Internet's top-level .com servers put together.\n\n\n\n2009.08.10 09:30\n60 minutes\ninvited lecture\nCanada\nresearchers\n\n[PDF slides]\nWOOT 2009.\nLe Centre Sheraton Hotel, Montreal.\n\"Breaking DNSSEC.\"\nKeynote lecture.\nAbstract:\n\n  More than two hundred sites around the world have installed DNSSEC\n  during the past year, so attackers can finally gain hands-on\n  experience with breaking DNSSEC servers.

A single day of computation\n   on a Core 2 Quad CPU is enough to cryptographically protect 50\n   billion packets exchanged with 500 million clients, more than the\n   load on all of the Internet's top-level .com servers put together.\n\n\n\n2009.06.24 10:00\n50 minutes\ninvited lecture\nBrazil\nresearchers\n\n[PDF slides]\nFórum Internacional de Software Livre.\nPontifícia Universidade do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), Porto Alegre.\n\"The DNS security mess.\"\nAbstract:\n\n   The Domain Name System publishes records such as \"softwarelivre.org\n   has IP address 200.169.21.196\".

All\nknown attacks against the cryptosystem, including attacks by quantum\ncomputers, take time exponential in the code length, while encryption\nand decryption take polynomial time with very small exponents.\n\nThis talk will explain (1) how the original parameters proposed by\nMcEliece were broken in 2008 by Bernstein, Lange, and Peters, (2) the\ncomputational issues that arise in using the cryptosystem for larger\nparameters, and (3) how list decoding of Goppa codes is connected to the\nLenstra--Konyagin--Pomerance--Coppersmith--Howgrave-Graham--Nagaraj\nalgorithm to find divisors in

to find medium-size factors of\n   composites, and to agree on a shared secret through a public channel.\n   These applications have drawn tremendous attention to elliptic curves\n   over the past twenty-five years.\n\n   Unfortunately, the standard elliptic-curve addition laws leave much\n   to be desired. They force the user to distinguish doublings from\n   generic additions; they have other exceptional cases; and they are\n   not very fast. One can eliminate the doubling distinction, and with\n   more work one can eliminate all of the exceptional cases over a\n   finite field, but the resulting addition laws are even slower than\n   the standard addition laws.\n\n   I will explain a new coordinate system that eliminates the need for\n   the doubling distinction, that eliminates all of the exceptional\n   cases for some curves, and that achieves remarkable speed. This\n   system has already set new speed records for elliptic-curve\n   computations, both in theory and in practice.\n\n   The audience is not expected to have prior exposure to elliptic\n   curves.\n\n\n\n2008.06.20 14:30\n60 minutes\ninvited lecture\nFrance\nlocal researchers\n\n[PDF slides]\nSeminar, University of Rennes.\n\"The elliptic-curve zoo.\"\nAbstract:\n\nThe pursuit of speed\nin elliptic-curve factoring\nand in elliptic-curve cryptography\nhas led researchers to consider\na remarkable variety of curve shapes and point representations.\nTanja Lange and I have built an Explicit-Formulas Database,\nhttp://hyperelliptic.org/EFD,\ncollecting (and sometimes correcting and often improving)\nthe addition formulas in the literature;\nEFD now contains 296 computer-verified explicit addition formulas\nfor 20 representations of points on 8 shapes of elliptic curves\nover large-characteristic fields.\nIn this talk I will survey the speeds\nthat have been obtained from several interesting curve shapes.\nIf time permits I will also comment on characteristic 2.\n\n\n\n2008.06.13 15:00\n30 minutes\nrefereed lecture\nMorocco\nresearchers\n\n[PDF slides]\nAfricacrypt 2008.\nCasablanca.\n\"Twisted Edwards curves.\"\n\n\n2008.06.05 09:30\n90 minutes\ninvited lecture\nNetherlands\nresearchers\n\n[PDF slides]\nHash functions in cryptology: theory and practice.\nLorentz Center, Leiden University.\n\"How fast are hash functions?\"\nKeynote talk.\n\n\n2008.05.19 16:50\n10 minutes\ncontributed lecture\nCanada\nresearchers\n\n[PDF slides]\nAlgorithmic Number Theory Symposium (ANTS).

difference.\nLow-cost differential addition chains\nare used to efficiently exponentiate\nin groups where the operation\na, b, a/b |-> ab is fast:\nin particular,\nto perform x-coordinate scalar multiplication P |-> mP\non an elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + x.\nSimilarly, low-cost two-dimensional differential addition chains\nare used to efficiently compute the function P, Q, P - Q |-> mP + nQ\non an elliptic curve.\nI will present two new constructive upper bounds\non the costs of two-dimensional differential addition chains.\nMy new `binary' chain is very easy to compute\nand uses 3 additions\n(14 field multiplications in the elliptic-curve context)\nper exponent bit,\nwith a uniform structure\nthat helps cryptographers protect against side-channel attacks.\nMy new `extended-gcd' chain takes more time to compute,\ndoes not have the uniform structure,\nand is not easy to analyze,\nbut experiments show that\nit takes only about 1.77 additions (9.97 field multiplications)\nper

It aims to formalise the pseudocode used in cryptographic standards by proposing a formal syntax that can be checked for simple errors. HacSpec specifications are further executable to test against test vectors specified in a common syntax.\nThe main focus of HacSpec is to allow specifications to be compiled to formal languages such as cryptol, coq, F*, and easycrypt and thus make it easier to formally verify implementations."

    "Description": "No new product offering has had greater impact on the computer industry than the IBM System/360. IBM's 360 and Early 370 Systems describes the creation of this remarkable system and the developments it spawned, including its successor, System/370. The authors tell how System/360's widely-copied architecture came into being and how IBM failed in an effort to replace it ten years later with a bold development effort called FS, the Future System. Along the way they detail the development of many computer innovations still in use, among them semiconductor memories, the cache, floppy disks, and Winchester disk files. They conclude by looking at issues involved in managing research and development and striving for product leadership.While numerous anecdotal and fragmentary accounts of System/360 and System/370 development exist, this is the first comprehensive account, a result of research into IBM records, published reports, and interviews with over a hundred participants. Covering the period from about 1960 to 1975, it highlights such important topics as the gamble on hybrid circuits, conception and achievement of a unified product line, memory and storage developments, software support, unique problems at the high end of the line, monolithic integrated circuit developments, and the trend toward terminal-oriented systems.System/360 was developed during the transition from discrete transistors to integrated circuits at the crucial time when the major source of IBM's revenue was changed from punched-card equipment to electronic computer systems. As the authors point out, the key to the system's success was compatibility among its many models. So important was this to customers that System/370 and its successors have remained compatible with System/360. Many companies in fact chose to develop and market their own 360-370 compatible systems. System/360 also spawned an entire industry dedicated to making plug-compatible products for attachment to it.The authors, all affiliated with IBM Research, are coauthors of IBM's Early Computers, a critically acclaimed technical history covering the period before 1960."

    "Description": "A recurring discussion in Overwatch (as well as other online games) is whether or not women are treated differently from men. If you do a quick search, you can find hundreds of discussions about this, some of which have well over a thousand comments. These discussions tend to go the same way and involve the same debate every time, with the same points being made on both sides. Just for example, these three threads on reddit that spun out of a single post that have a total of 10.4k comments. On one side, you have people saying \"sure, women get trash talked, but I'm a dude and I get trash talked, everyone gets trash talked there's no difference\", \"I've never seen this, it can't be real\", etc., and on the other side you have people saying things like \"when I play with my boyfriend, I get accused of being carried by him all the time but the reverse never happens\", \"people regularly tell me I should play mercy[, a character that's a female healer]\", and so on and so forth. In less time than has been spent on a single large discussion, we could just run the experiment, so here it is."

    "Description": "During development of meshoptimizer a question that comes up relatively often is “should this algorithm use SIMD?”. The library is performance-oriented, but SIMD doesn’t always provide significant performance benefits - unfortunately, the use of SIMD can make the code less portable and less maintainable, so this tradeoff has to be resolved on a case by case basis. When performance is of utmost importance, such as vertex/index codecs, separate SIMD implementations for SSE and NEON instruction sets need to be developed and maintained. In other cases it’s helpful to understand how much SIMD can help to make the decision. Today we will go through the exercise of accelerating sloppy mesh simplifier, a new algorithm that was recently added to the library, using SSEn/AVXn instruction sets."

To achieve this, we devise two novel area-preserving mappings from the unit square to this projection, which is often an ellipse but generally has a more complex shape. Our maps allow for low-variance rendering of direct illumination from finite and infinite (e.g. sun-like) spherical light sources by sampling their projected solid angle in a stratified manner. We discuss the practical implementation of our maps and show significant quality improvement over traditional uniform spherical cap sampling in a production renderer."

The focus of this work is on artistic control and ease of implementation for real-time and off-line rendering. We propose relying on a composite material based on a pair of arbitrary BRDF models; however, instead of controlling their physical parameters, we expose perceptual parameters inspired by visual experiments [VBF17]. Our main contribution then consists in a mapping from perceptual to physical parameters that ensures the resulting composite BRDF is valid in terms of reciprocity, positivity and energy conservation. The immediate benefit of our approach is to provide direct artistic control over both the intensity and extent of the haze effect, which is not only necessary for editing purposes, but also essential to vary haziness spatially over an object surface. Our solution is also simple to implement as it requires no new importance sampling strategy and relies on existing BRDF models. Such a simplicity is key to approximating the method for the editing of hazy gloss in real-time and for compositing."

    "Description": "Previous proposals to permit non-exponential free-path statistics in\nradiative transfer have not included support for volume and boundary sources\nthat are spatially uncorrelated from the scattering events in the medium.\nBirth-collision free paths are treated identically to collision-collision free\npaths and application of this to general, bounded scenes with inclusions leads\nto non-reciprocal transport. Beginning with reciprocity as a desired property,\nwe propose a new way to integrate non-exponential transport theory into general\nscenes. We distinguish between the free-path-length statistics between\ncorrelated medium particles and the free-path-length statistics beginning at\nlocations not correlated to medium particles, such as boundary surfaces,\ninclusions and uncorrelated sources. Reciprocity requires that the uncorrelated\nfree-path distributions are simply the normalized transmittance of the\ncorrelated free-path distributions. The combination leads to an equilibrium\nimbedding of a previously derived generalized transport equation into bounded\ndomains. We compare predictions of this approach to Monte Carlo simulation of\nmultiple scattering from negatively-correlated suspensions of monodispersive\nhard spheres in bounded two-dimensional domains and demonstrate improved\nperformance relative to previous work. We also derive new, exact, reciprocal,\nsingle-scattering solutions for plane-parallel half-spaces over a variety of\nnon-exponential media types."

    "Description": "We introduce a non-exponential radiative framework that takes into account the local spatial correlation of scattering particles in a medium. Most previous works in graphics have ignored this, assuming uncorrelated media with a uniform, random local distribution of particles. However, positive and negative correlation lead to slower- and faster-than-exponential attenuation respectively, which cannot be predicted by the Beer-Lambert law. As our results show, this has a major effect on extinction, and thus appearance. From recent advances in neutron transport, we first introduce our Extended Generalized Boltzmann Equation, and develop a general framework for light transport in correlated media. We lift the limitations of the original formulation, including an analysis of the boundary conditions, and present a model suitable for computer graphics, based on optical properties of the media and statistical distributions of scatterers. In addition, we present an analytic expression for transmittance in the case of positive correlation, and show how to incorporate it efficiently into a Monte Carlo renderer. We show results with a wide range of both positive and negative correlation, and demonstrate the differences compared to classic light transport."

    "Description": "Naïve linear methods for downsampling high-resolution microflake volumes often produce inaccurate appearance, especially when input voxels are very opaque. Preserving correct appearance at all resolutions requires taking into account masking-shadowing effects that occur between and inside dense input voxels. We introduce a new microflake model whose additional parameters characterize self-shadowing effects at a microscopic scale. We provide an anisotropic self-shadowing function and microflake distributions for which the scattering coefficients and the phase functions of our model have closed-form expressions. We use this model in a new downsampling approach in which scattering parameters are computed from local estimations of self-shadowing probabilities in the input volume. Unlike previous work, our method handles datasets with spatially varying scattering parameters, semi-transparent volumes and datasets with intricate silhouettes. We show that our method generates LoDs with correct transparency and consistent appearance through scales for a wide range of challenging datasets, allowing for huge memory savings and efficient distant rendering without loss of quality."

    "Description": "The visual appearance of real-world materials is characterized by surface features across many scales and has received significant attention by the graphics community for decades. Yet, even the most advanced microfacet models have difficulties faithfully recreating materials like snow, sand, brushed metal or hair that feature scale-violating glints and speckles and defy any traditional notion of filtering and level of detail. In this work, we address an important subset of such materials, namely metal and dielectric surfaces that are covered with microscopic scratches, e.g., from polishing processes or surface wear. The appearance of such surfaces features fine-scale spatial detail and iridescent colors caused by diffraction, and has only recently been successfully recreated. We adopt the scratch iridescence model, which is known for plausible results in offline Monte Carlo settings but unsuitable for real-time applications where extensive illumination sampling is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we introduce an efficient technique for incoherently integrating the contributions of individual scratches, as well as closed-form solutions for modeling spherical and polygonal area light sources, and for the first time bring scratch iridescence within reach of real-time applications."

If you do a quick search, you can find hundreds of discussions about this, some of which have well over a thousand comments. These discussions tend to go the same way and involve the same debate every time, with the same points being made on both sides. Just for example, these three threads on reddit that spun out of a single post that have a total of 10.4k comments. On one side, you have people saying \"sure, women get trash talked, but I'm a dude and I get trash talked, everyone gets trash talked there's no difference\", \"I've never seen this, it can't be real\", etc., and on the other side you have people saying things like \"when I play with my boyfriend, I get accused of being carried by him all the time but the reverse never happens\", \"people regularly tell me I should play mercy[, a character that's a female healer]\", and so on and so forth. In less time than has been spent on a single large discussion, we could just run the experiment, so here it is."

This paper introduces Mesh, a plug-in\nreplacement for malloc that, for the first time, eliminates fragmentation in\nunmodified C/C++ applications. Mesh combines novel randomized algorithms with\nwidely-supported virtual memory operations to provably reduce fragmentation,\nbreaking the classical Robson bounds with high probability. Mesh generally\nmatches the runtime performance of state-of-the-art memory allocators while\nreducing memory consumption; in particular, it reduces the memory of\nconsumption of Firefox by 16% and Redis by 39%."

By expressing large systems as compositions of small, pure functions, we've found it's possible to achieve tighter couplings between these components, improving performance without giving up modularity or the ability to debug. I'll discuss our experience with systems that demonstrate this basic idea: ExCamera (NSDI 2017) parallelizes video encoding into thousands of tiny tasks, each handling a fraction of a second of video, much shorter than the interval between key frames, and executing in parallel on AWS Lambda. This was the first system to demonstrate "

    "Domain": "yahoo.tumblr.com",
    "Description": "By Bob Lord, CISO\n\n A recent investigation by Yahoo has confirmed that a copy of certain user account information was stolen from the company’s network in late 2014 by what it believes is a state-sponsored actor. The account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (the vast majority with bcrypt) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The ongoing investigation suggests that stolen information did not include unprotected passwords, payment card data, or bank account information; payment card data and bank account information are not stored in the system that the investigation has found to be affected. Based on the ongoing investigation, Yahoo believes that information associated with at least 500 million user accounts was stolen and the investigation has found no evidence that the state-sponsored actor is currently in Yahoo’s network. Yahoo is working closely with law enforcement on this matter.\n\n We are taking action to protect our users:\n\n \n We are notifying potentially affected users. The content of the email Yahoo is sending to those users will be available at  https://yahoo.com/security-notice-content beginning at 11:30 am (PDT). \n\n We are asking potentially affected users to promptly change their passwords and adopt alternate means of account verification. \n\n We invalidated unencrypted security questions and answers so they cannot be used to access an account. \n\n We are recommending that all users who haven’t changed their passwords since 2014 do so. \n\n We continue to enhance our systems that detect and prevent unauthorized access to user accounts. \n\n We are working closely with law enforcement on this matter. \n\n\n We encourage our users to follow these security recommendations:\n\n \n Change your password and security questions and answers for any other accounts on which you used the same or similar information used for your Yahoo account. \n\n Review your accounts for suspicious activity.  \n\n Be cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask for your personal information or refer you to a web page asking for personal information. \n\n Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails. \n\n\n Additionally, please consider using Yahoo Account Key, a simple authentication tool that eliminates the need to use a password altogether.\n\n An increasingly connected world has come with increasingly sophisticated threats. Industry, government and users are constantly in the crosshairs of adversaries. Through strategic proactive detection initiatives and active response to unauthorized access of accounts, Yahoo will continue to strive to stay ahead of these ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and our platforms secure.\n\n For more information about this issue and our security resources, please visit the Yahoo Security Issue FAQs page, https://yahoo.com/security-update, which will be up beginning at 12pm (PDT).\n\n Statements in this press release regarding the findings of Yahoo’s ongoing investigation involve potential risks and uncertainties.  The final conclusions of the investigation may differ from the findings to date due to various factors including, but not limited to, the discovery of new or additional information and other developments that may arise during the course of the investigation.  More information about potential risks and uncertainties of security breaches that could affect the Company’s business and financial results is included under the caption “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, which is on file with the SEC and available on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov./\n\n https://investor.yahoo.net/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=990570"

    "Description": "Website fingerprinting attacks, which use statistical analysis on network\ntraffic to compromise user privacy, have been shown to be effective even if the\ntraffic is sent over anonymity-preserving networks such as Tor. The classical\nattack model used to evaluate website fingerprinting attacks assumes an on-path\nadversary, who can observe all traffic traveling between the user's computer\nand the Tor network. In this work we investigate these attacks under a\ndifferent attack model, in which the adversary is capable of running a small\namount of unprivileged code on the target user's computer. Under this model,\nthe attacker can mount cache side-channel attacks, which exploit the effects of\ncontention on the CPU's cache, to identify the website being browsed. In an\nimportant special case of this attack model, a JavaScript attack is launched\nwhen the target user visits a website controlled by the attacker. The\neffectiveness of this attack scenario has never been systematically analyzed,\nespecially in the open-world model which assumes that the user is visiting a\nmix of both sensitive and non-sensitive sites. In this work we show that cache\nwebsite fingerprinting attacks in JavaScript are highly feasible, even when\nthey are run from highly restrictive environments, such as the Tor Browser.\nSpecifically, we use machine learning techniques to classify traces of cache\nactivity. Unlike prior works, which try to identify cache conflicts, our work\nmeasures the overall occupancy of the last-level cache. We show that our\napproach achieves high classification accuracy in both the open-world and the\nclosed-world models. We further show that our techniques are resilient both to\nnetwork-based defenses and to side-channel countermeasures introduced to modern\nbrowsers as a response to the Spectre attack."

    "Description": "Modern CPU architectures offer strong isolation guarantees towards user\napplications in the form of enclaves. For instance, Intel's threat model for\nSGX assumes fully trusted enclaves, yet there is an ongoing debate on whether\nthis threat model is realistic. In particular, it is unclear to what extent\nenclave malware could harm a system. In this work, we practically demonstrate\nthe first enclave malware which fully and stealthily impersonates its host\napplication. Together with poorly-deployed application isolation on personal\ncomputers, such malware can not only steal or encrypt documents for extortion,\nbut also act on the user's behalf, e.g., sending phishing emails or mounting\ndenial-of-service attacks. Our SGX-ROP attack uses new TSX-based\nmemory-disclosure primitive and a write-anything-anywhere primitive to\nconstruct a code-reuse attack from within an enclave which is then\ninadvertently executed by the host application. With SGX-ROP, we bypass ASLR,\nstack canaries, and address sanitizer. We demonstrate that instead of\nprotecting users from harm, SGX currently poses a security threat, facilitating\nso-called super-malware with ready-to-hit exploits. With our results, we seek\nto demystify the enclave malware threat and lay solid ground for future\nresearch on and defense against enclave malware."

Unfortunately, in order to run this headless, I need to use xvfb. I've run into multiple problems with this, including previously crashed X servers by other users on the cluster lingering around. Not to mention that xvfb can only run my code with software rendering, which is slow.\n\nI would really like it if Pyglet implemented support for the EGL API, so that it can run headless with 3D acceleration, and without needing an X server or xvfb."

    "Description": "Supervised training of neural networks for classification is typically\nperformed with a global loss function. The loss function provides a gradient\nfor the output layer, and this gradient is back-propagated to hidden layers to\ndictate an update direction for the weights. An alternative approach is to\ntrain the network with layer-wise loss functions. In this paper we demonstrate,\nfor the first time, that layer-wise training can approach the state-of-the-art\non a variety of image datasets. We use single-layer sub-networks and two\ndifferent supervised loss functions to generate local error signals for the\nhidden layers, and we show that the combination of these losses help with\noptimization in the context of local learning. Using local errors could be a\nstep towards more biologically plausible deep learning because the global error\ndoes not have to be transported back to hidden layers. A completely backprop\nfree variant outperforms previously reported results among methods aiming for\nhigher biological plausibility. Code is available\nhttps://github.com/anokland/local-loss"

    "Description": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been successfully applied\nto a range of challenging control tasks. However, these methods typically\nsuffer from three core difficulties: temporal credit assignment with sparse\nrewards, lack of effective exploration, and brittle convergence properties that\nare extremely sensitive to hyperparameters. Collectively, these challenges\nseverely limit the applicability of these approaches to real-world problems.\nEvolutionary Algorithms (EAs), a class of black box optimization techniques\ninspired by natural evolution, are well suited to address each of these three\nchallenges. However, EAs typically suffer from high sample complexity and\nstruggle to solve problems that require optimization of a large number of\nparameters. In this paper, we introduce Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning\n(ERL), a hybrid algorithm that leverages the population of an EA to provide\ndiversified data to train an RL agent, and reinserts the RL agent into the EA\npopulation periodically to inject gradient information into the EA. ERL\ninherits EA's ability of temporal credit assignment with a fitness metric,\neffective exploration with a diverse set of policies, and stability of a\npopulation-based approach and complements it with off-policy DRL's ability to\nleverage gradients for higher sample efficiency and faster learning.\nExperiments in a range of challenging continuous control benchmarks demonstrate\nthat ERL significantly outperforms prior DRL and EA methods."

    "Description": "James Mickens, Harvard University\n\nQ: Why Do Keynote Speakers Keep Suggesting That Improving Security Is Possible?\nA: Because Keynote Speakers Make Bad Life Decisions and Are Poor Role Models\n\nSome people enter the technology industry to build newer, more exciting kinds of technology as quickly as possible. My keynote will savage these people and will burn important professional bridges, likely forcing me to join a monastery or another penance-focused organization. In my keynote, I will explain why the proliferation of ubiquitous technology is good in the same sense that ubiquitous Venus weather would be good, i.e., not good at all. Using case studies involving machine learning and other hastily-executed figments of Silicon Valley’s imagination, I will explain why computer security (and larger notions of ethical computing) are difficult to achieve if developers insist on literally not questioning anything that they do since even brief introspection would reduce the frequency of git commits. At some point, my microphone will be cut off, possibly by hotel management, but possibly by myself, because microphones are technology and we need to reclaim the stark purity that emerges from amplifying our voices using rams’ horns and sheets of papyrus rolled into cone shapes. I will explain why papyrus cones are not vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks, and then I will conclude by observing that my new start-up papyr.us is looking for talented full-stack developers who are comfortable executing computational tasks on an abacus or several nearby sticks.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '18 program at https://www.usenix.org/usenixsecurity18/technical-sessions"

    "Description": "Taking inspiration from biological evolution, we explore the idea of \"Can\ndeep neural networks evolve naturally over successive generations into highly\nefficient deep neural networks?\" by introducing the notion of synthesizing new\nhighly efficient, yet powerful deep neural networks over successive generations\nvia an evolutionary process from ancestor deep neural networks. The\narchitectural traits of ancestor deep neural networks are encoded using\nsynaptic probability models, which can be viewed as the `DNA' of these\nnetworks. New descendant networks with differing network architectures are\nsynthesized based on these synaptic probability models from the ancestor\nnetworks and computational environmental factor models, in a random manner to\nmimic heredity, natural selection, and random mutation. These offspring\nnetworks are then trained into fully functional networks, like one would train\na newborn, and have more efficient, more diverse network architectures than\ntheir ancestor networks, while achieving powerful modeling capabilities.\nExperimental results for the task of visual saliency demonstrated that the\nsynthesized `evolved' offspring networks can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance while having network architectures that are significantly more\nefficient (with a staggering $\\sim$48-fold decrease in synapses by the fourth\ngeneration) compared to the original ancestor network."

    "Description": "For most deep learning practitioners, sequence modeling is synonymous with\nrecurrent networks. Yet recent results indicate that convolutional\narchitectures can outperform recurrent networks on tasks such as audio\nsynthesis and machine translation. Given a new sequence modeling task or\ndataset, which architecture should one use? We conduct a systematic evaluation\nof generic convolutional and recurrent architectures for sequence modeling. The\nmodels are evaluated across a broad range of standard tasks that are commonly\nused to benchmark recurrent networks. Our results indicate that a simple\nconvolutional architecture outperforms canonical recurrent networks such as\nLSTMs across a diverse range of tasks and datasets, while demonstrating longer\neffective memory. We conclude that the common association between sequence\nmodeling and recurrent networks should be reconsidered, and convolutional\nnetworks should be regarded as a natural starting point for sequence modeling\ntasks. To assist related work, we have made code available at\nhttp://github.com/locuslab/TCN ."

I’ve been asking around for some ideas, and one developer mentioned I might want to cover compute shaders. So I went in, without much hope to attract many people, but I ended up with an overcrowded room with roughly one quarter of all the game camp participants, rambling about compute shaders for roughly an hour. Afterwards, the main question I got was: “Where can I read about this?”, and I couldn’t quite nail a good introduction to compute shaders (there’s Ryg’s “a trip through the graphics pipeline”, but that’s already quite past an introduction.)"

Facebook was the only one who responded. Below is their statement:\n\nStatement:\n “Our vendor workers are valued members of our community. We are committed to providing a safe, fair, work environment to everyone who helps Facebook bring the world closer together, including vendor employees and contingent workers.”– Facebook Spokesperson\n\n \nSOURCES & FURTHER READING\n\nTech’s Invisible Workforce\nhttps://wpusa.org/files/reports/TechsInvisibleWorkforce.pdf\n\nTech's top five now worth more than $3 trillion\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2017/10/31/investing/apple-google-alphabet-microsoft-amazon-facebook-tech/index.html \n\nCalifornia's top court makes it more difficult for employers to classify workers as independent contractors\nhttp://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-independent-contract-20180430-story.html \n\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Neha Shastry\nCamera: Ilie Mitaru\nEditor: Michelle Pomeroy\nSupervising Producer: Allison Brown\n\nFollow Beme on\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bemenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bemeapp\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/officialbeme/"

    "Description": "Rocketbirds 2 Evolution - Now available on Steam! - We kept the trailer short, but sweet!\n\nSpecial thanks go out to Charles Woodson Parker yet again for providing the VO at such short notice! James McCreadie, for Metal Chicken and being such a great guy! Also, thanks go out to Herwig Maurer, the one man army and genius behind New World Revolution, for providing the final audio mix down and an epic score! And Rocketbirds fans for being so goddamn patient with us! Let's launch this puppy already!\n\nHere's the link:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/470210/\n\nHere's the details:\n\nThe “most interesting chicken in the world” is back in his first sequel Rocketbirds 2: Evolution, where Hardboiled Chicken gets entangled in a mysterious and sinister penguin plot in “Part 1: The Cockup”. Meanwhile, the pint sized budgie commandos are forming a strike force of great magnitude in “Part 2: The Rescue”, where players need to rescue and recruit hostages from deep behind enemy lines. Both parts can be played in or out of order, but converge to complete the full Evolution story.\n\nPlayers will engage in nuanced, side-scrolling, shooter action as they face an assortment of evil penguins, space owls and other fowl creatures while strapping on jetpacks and wielding new, powerful weapons of ‘de-clucktion.’\n\nKey features of Rocketbirds 2: Evolution include:\n\n• Cinematic platforming, action-adventure game with light puzzle elements and Jetpacks in Part 1: The Cockup \n• Over 100 upgradeable weapons, costumes and stackable characters to unlock in procedurally generated missions in Part 2: The Rescue\n• Part 2 also features 1 - 4 player online / offline / drop-in / drop-out cooperative features and a PvP mini game\n• Original soundtrack by New World Revolution"

By seeing examples of what humans did, they can learn to translate languages, predict product sales, and even categorize text and images as innocuous or explicit (it has a lot of trouble with this last task, as it turns out).\n\n One neural network I use, called textgenrnn, tries its best to imitate any kind of text you give it. I’ve given them paint colors, band names, and even guinea pig names and in each case their results are somewhat… mixed. (Paint colors called Stanky Bean, Stargoon, and Turdly, for example) The problem is that it doesn’t know what any of these words mean - it’s just picking letter combinations that seem likely to it.\n\n This is what happened when I gave it all the cookies from a list of American recipes. This is what human cookies sound like to a neural network.\n\n Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go whip up a batch of Fluffin Coffee Drops.\n\n For more cookies, including the neural net’s strange obsession with “balls,” as well as bonus material every time I post, you can sign up here.\n\n Want to help with a future project? I’m crowdsourcing a dataset of college essay prompts. Let’s see if a neural net can write some that are more interesting than the usual!"

The ignominious rout that was the Battle of the Pyramids had cost the Mamelukes not only 10,000 of their best soldiers but also their reputation for cruel invincibility. It had revealed the rot at the core of the storied warrior caste; no more could they hold an unquestioning populace in their thrall. Yet if not the Mamelukes, then who should rule Egypt, which was still nominally a part of the Ottoman Empire but remained as loosely overseen as ever? There was Opportunity here for an ambitious, guileful, and ruthless man."

A revolution that had been born in 1789 out of the new Enlightenment ideals of democracy, equality, and fundamental human rights collapsed over the years that followed into the spasms of senseless killing that became known as the Reign of Terror. When a “Directory” of five semi-anonymous men who were remarkable only for their corruption took power in 1795, an exhausted country was willing to accept this pale shadow of the revolutionary ideal if it would stop the ceaseless chattering of Madame La Guillotine."

But, for reasons that I hope everyone can understand, I’ve spent much more time illuminating negative than positive examples of puzzle design. The fact is, I don’t feel much compunction about spoiling bad puzzles. Spoiling the great puzzles, however, is something I’m always loath to do. I want my readers to have the thrill of tackling those for themselves."

    "Description": "This series of articles so far has been a story of business-oriented personal computing. Corporate America had been running for decades on IBM before the IBM PC appeared, so it was only natural that the standard IBM introduced would be embraced as the way to get serious, businesslike things done on a personal computer. Yet long before IBM entered the picture, personal computing in general had been pioneered by hackers and hobbyists, many of whom nursed grander dreams than giving secretaries a better typewriter or giving accountants a better way to add up figures. These pioneers didn’t go away after 1981, but neither did they embrace the IBM PC, which most of them dismissed as technically unimaginative and aesthetically disastrous. Instead they spent the balance of the 1980s using computers like the Apple II, the Commodore 64, the Commodore Amiga, and the Atari ST to communicate with one another, to draw pictures, to make music, and of course to write and play lots and lots of games. Dwarfed already in terms of dollars and cents at mid-decade by the business-computing monster the IBM PC had birthed, this vibrant alternative computing ecosystem — sometimes called home computing, sometimes consumer computing — makes a far more interesting subject for the cultural historian of today than the world of IBM and Microsoft, with its boring green screens and boring corporate spokesmen running scared from the merest mention of digital creativity. It’s for this reason that, a few series like this one aside, I’ve spent the vast majority of my time on this blog talking about the cultures of creative computing rather than those of IBM and Microsoft."

    "Description": "Microsoft Windows 3.0’s conquest of the personal-computer marketplace was bad news for a huge swath of the industry. On the software side, companies like Lotus and WordPerfect, only recently so influential that it was difficult to imagine a world that didn’t include them, would never regain the clout they had enjoyed during the 1980s, and would gradually fade away entirely. On the hardware side, it was true that plenty of makers of commodity PC clones were happier to work with a Microsoft who believed a rising tide lifted all their boats than against an IBM that was continually trying to put them out of business. But what of Big Blue themselves, still the biggest hardware maker of all, who were accustomed to dictating the direction of the industry rather than being dictated to by any mere maker of software? And what, for that matter, of Apple? Both Apple and IBM found themselves in the unaccustomed position of being the outsiders in this new Windows era of computing. Each must come to terms with Microsoft’s newfound but overwhelming power, even as each remained determined not to give up the heritage of innovation that had gotten them this far."

On the one hand, profits were up, and Bill Gates and any number of his colleagues could retire as very rich men indeed even if it all ended tomorrow — not that that outcome looked likely. The company was coming to be seen as the standard setter of the personal-computer industry, more important even than an IBM that had been gravely weakened by the PS/2 debacle and the underwhelming reception of OS/2. Microsoft Windows, now once again viewed by Gates as the keystone of his company’s future after the disappointment that had been OS/2, stood to benefit greatly from Microsoft’s new clout. Windows 2 had gained some real traction, and the upcoming Windows 3 was being talked about with mounting expectation by an MS-DOS marketplace that finally seemed to be technologically and psychologically ready for a GUI environment."

As OS/2 ramped up, Windows ramped down in proportion, until by the middle of 1986 Tandy Trower had just a few programmers remaining on his team. What had once been Microsoft’s highest-priority project had now become a backwater. Many were asking what the point of Windows was in light of OS/2 and its new GUI, the Presentation Manager. Steve Ballmer, ironically the very same fellow who had played the role of Windows’s cheerleader-in-chief during 1984 and 1985, was now the most prominent of those voices inside Microsoft who couldn’t understand why Trower’s team continued to exist at all."

    "Description": "We’ve seen how the pundits had already started speculating like crazy long before the actual release of IBM’s TopView, imagining it to be the key to some Machiavellian master plan for seizing complete control of the personal-computer market. But said pundits were giving IBM a bit more credit than perhaps was due. The company nicknamed Big Blue was indeed a big, notoriously bureaucratic place, and that reality tended to interfere with their ability to carry out any scheme, Machiavellian or otherwise, with the single-minded focus of a smaller company. There doubtless were voices inside IBM who could imagine using TopView as a way of shoving Microsoft aside, and had the product been a roaring success those voices doubtless would have been amplified. Yet thanks to the sheer multiplicity of voices IBM contained, the organization always seemed to be pulling in multiple directions at once. Thus even before TopView hit the market and promptly fizzled, a serious debate was taking place inside IBM about the long-term future direction of their personal computers’ system software. This particular debate didn’t focus on extensions to MS-DOS — not even on an extension like TopView which might eventually be decoupled from the unimpressive operating system underneath it. The question at hand was rather what should be done about creating a truly holistic replacement for MS-DOS. The release of a new model of IBM personal computer in August of 1984 had given that question new urgency."

That month, IBM released the PC/AT, a new model of their personal computer based around the more powerful Intel 80286 processor. Amidst the hoopla over that event, they invited Microsoft and other prominent industry players to a sneak preview of something called TopView, and Bill Gates got an answer at last to the fraught question of why IBM had been so uninterested in his own company’s Windows operating environment."

In their paintings, films, even furniture, the French often discard the stodgy literalism that is so characteristic of Anglo art in favor of something more attenuated, where impression becomes more important than objective reality. A French art film doesn’t come off as a complete non sequitur to Anglo eyes in the way that, say, a Bollywood or Egyptian production can. Yet the effect it creates is in its way much more disorienting: it seems on the surface to be something recognizable and predictable, but suddenly zigs where we expect it to zag. In particular, it may show disconcertingly little interest in the logic of plot, that central concern of Anglo film. What affects what and why is of far less interest to a filmmaker like, say, François Truffaut than the emotional affect of the whole."

The former made a lot of games, on diverse subjects and of diverse quality, emphasizing always whatever new audiovisual flash was made possible by the very latest computing technology. The latter, on the other hand, made far fewer and far less diverse but more careful games, fostering a true designer’s culture that emphasized polish over flash. In their attitudes toward player-character death and dead ends, toward puzzle design, toward graphics style, each company had a distinct personality, and adventure-game fans lined up, as they continue to do even today, as partisans of one or the other."

Meier claims that the game presents at best a children’s-book view of history, that the only real considerations that went into it were what would be fun and what wouldn’t. I don’t want to criticize him for that stance here, any more than I want to minimize the huge place that fun or the lack thereof really did fill in the decisions that he and his partner Bruce Shelley made about Civilization. I understand why he says what he says: he’s a commercial game designer, not a political pundit, and he has no desire to wade into controversy — and possibly shrink his customer base — by taking public positions on the sorts of fractious topics I’ve been addressing over the course of these articles. If he should need further encouragement to stay well away from those topics, he can find it in the many dogmatic academic critiques of Civilization which accuse it of being little more than triumphalist propaganda. He’d rather spend his time talking about game design, which strikes me as perfectly reasonable."

Despite running a company whose official name was Sierra On-Line — admittedly, the second part of the name was already being de-emphasized by the end of the 1980s, and would eventually be dropped entirely — he had paid no more attention than most of his peers to the rise of commercial online services like CompuServe. Sierra maintained a modest presence in such places, even agreed to the occasional online chat, but telecommunication was hardly central to their business strategy during the first eight years or so of their existence. All that began to change, however, when a new service called Prodigy made a splashy entrance in 1988."

    "Description": "By 1990, life for the programmers and artists who made adventure games for Sierra On-Line had settled down into a predictable pattern. Even-numbered years were King’s Quest years, when the company pulled out all the stops to deliver a new iteration of their flagship series that incorporated all the latest technologies — that looked and sounded better than anything they had ever done before. Odd-numbered years offered a chance to decompress, letting the creative teams apply the techniques that had been developed for King’s Quest to other games — games that were often more eclectic and, to this writer’s mind at least, more interesting — while the marketing people had more time to devise promotional strategies for same. Not coincidentally, Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards and Hero’s Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero, Sierra’s two most successful non-King’s Quest series debuts to date, had each been launched in an odd year. Sierra was making enough games by the dawn of the 1990s that even a King’s Quest year would see the release of plenty of other, non-King’s Quest games. But everyone knew where management’s priorities lay when it came time for Roberta Williams to start to think about King Graham and Daventry once again."

She wrote 1991’s Cosmoserve herself, then organized the team of authors that created 1992’s Shades of Gray. Both works are inextricably bound up with the online life of their era. Cosmoserve is a simulation and gentle satire of daily life on CompuServe, the most popular of the pre-World Wide Web commercial online services, while Shades of Gray was created by people who had met one another only on CompuServe, who used a CompuServe chat room as their primary means of communication. Given that I’ve written so voluminously on the text adventures of Infocom and others over the years, and given I’ve spent most of the last two months chronicling the net before the Web, a conversation with Judith about text adventures on CompuServe seemed the perfect way to tie the two strands together."

The games of 1991 show what a misnomer the word “rebirth” really is in this case; the text adventure never actually went away at all. The tools available to amateur authors were certainly rougher than they would be in years to come, design standards as well less thought-through, but the fact remains that not a single year has gone by since Adventure first took the computing world by storm in 1977 when at least one or two worthy text adventures haven’t been written. In fact, hobbyists did considerably better than that in 1991. Amidst its blizzard of activity, that year yielded the four games I’ll be writing about today: two classics, one enjoyable journeyman, and one heart-breaker which came that close to being one of the finest text adventures ever written. Not bad for a dead form, eh?"

There’s not even a single “awesome!” in sight; unlike most of Patreon’s missives, it doesn’t read like it was written by an over-enthused Valley girl. Patreon says that they still want to address the problem which allegedly prompted the changes in the first place — a problem which was never a problem at all for this blog — but they promise to do so in consultation with the community instead of unilaterally, and they promise to find ways to protect the small donors on which this blog and many other projects depend. “We are nothing without you,” Jack Conte writes.

    "Description": "Right from the beginning, games were a component of the commercial online services that predated the World Wide Web; both The Source and CompuServe included them among their offerings from the moment those services first went online. In the early years, such online games were mostly refugees from 1970s institutional computing. Classics like Star Trek, Adventure, and Hammurabi had the advantage of being in the public domain and already running without modification on the time-shared computer systems which hosted the services, and could thus be made available to subscribers with a minimum of investment. Eventually even some text-only microcomputer games made the transition. By 1984, CompuServe, now well-established at the vanguard of the burgeoning online-services industry, had a catalog that included the original Adventure along with an expanded version, nine Scott Adams games, and the original PDP-10 Zork (renamed for some reason to The House of Banshi). And those were just the text adventures. There were also the dungeon crawls Dungeons of Kesmai and Castle Telengard and the war games Civil War, Fantasy, and Command Decision, while for the less hardcore there were the CompuServe Casino, board games like Reversi, and curiosities like a biorhythm charter and an astrology calculator."

In fact, virtually from the moment that Jeff Wilkins decided the nascent MicroNET had potential that was worth seriously investing in — a moment we can date to the very end of 1979 — he started casting about for information and applications which CompuServe’s users couldn’t possibly create for themselves."

None of this trio, needless to say, had done much for Psygnosis’s reputation. But with Barbarian the company’s fortunes finally began to change.

In April of 1984, Paul Anderson, one of the program’s stable of directors, began to shoot an episode about the computer-game industry, as seen through the eyes of Liverpool’s Imagine Software and Manchester’s Ocean Software. These two Northern software houses, each situated in a city that had been struggling mightily in recent years, had been specifically chosen to drive home the point that the craze for microcomputers and computer games was a national one rather than just a hobby of posh Londoners. Computers were transforming the way British youth from the Shetland Islands to Cornwall spent their free time, and computer games could earn those entrepreneurs who were successful at selling them millions of pounds. This, went the message from Thatcher on down, was an area where the new Britain stood poised to excel."

CD-ROM, the most disruptive technology in gaming since the invention of the microprocessor, hasn’t arrived as quickly as many expected it would, but it nevertheless looms there on the horizon as developers and publishers scramble to prepare themselves for the impact it must have. For us virtual time travelers, then, there’s a lot to look forward to. It should be as exciting a time to write about — and hopefully to read about — as it was to live through."

If I go forward with it — and whether I do or not may come to hinge on any feedback I get as a result of this little message — it will encompass both an aesthetic design and a significant technical — read, custom programming — component. I understand that those two roles will quite likely need to be played by two or more people, and that’s fine, although they would ideally be people who already have experience working together as a team."

    "Description": "When Brian Fargo made the bold decision in 1988 to turn his company Interplay into a computer-game publisher as well as developer, he was simply steering onto the course that struck him as most likely to ensure Interplay’s survival. Interplay had created one of the more popular computer games of the 1980s in the form of the 400,000-plus-selling CRPG The Bard’s Tale, yet had remained a tiny company living hand-to-mouth while their publisher Electronic Arts sucked up the lion’s share of the profits. And rankling almost as much as that disparity was the fact that Electronic Arts sucked up the lion’s share of the credit as well; very few gamers even recognized the name of Interplay in 1988. If this was what it was like to be an indentured developer immediately after making the best-selling single CRPG of the 1980s, what would it be like when The Bard’s Tale faded into ancient history? The odds of making it as an independent publisher may not have looked great, but from some angles at least they looked better than Interplay’s prospects if the status quo was allowed to continue."

I like to think that this approach has made my blog a uniquely enlightening window into gaming history. Still, one thing my years as a digital antiquarian have taught me is that you tread on people’s nostalgia at your peril. Some of what I’ve written here over the years has certainly generated its share of heat as well as light, not so much among those of you who are regular readers and commenters — you remain the most polite, thoughtful, insightful, and just plain nice readers any writer could hope to have — as among the ones who fire off nasty emails from anonymous addresses, who post screeds on less polite sites to which I’m occasionally pointed, or who offer up their drive-by comments right here every once in a while."

    "Description": "For text-adventure fans confronting the emerging reality of a post-Infocom world, AGT was a godsend, allowing amateurs for the first time to create games that at a quick glance might appear to match those of Infocom. Still, AGT was far from the answer to every prayer, for the fact remained that it would have to be a very quick glance indeed. David Malmberg, the developer of AGT, was ingenious and motivated, but he was also a self-taught programmer with little background in the complexities of programming languages and compiler design. He had built AGT by adding to Mark Welch’s profoundly limited GAGS system for creating generic database-driven text adventures a scripting language that ignored pretty much all of the precepts of good language design. What he had ended up with was almost a sort of technological folk art, clever and creative and practical in its way, but rather horrifying to anyone with a deeper grounding in computing theory. The best argument in favor of AGT was that it worked — basically. While the system was undoubtedly more capable than anything that had been available to hobbyists before, it still didn’t take much poking at an AGT game before the rickety edifice’s seams began to show.  A number of authors would push the system to unforeseen heights, in the process creating a number of classic games, but it was obvious that AGT could never work quite well enough to create games as polished as those of Infocom. To do that, a language would be needed that was truly designed rather than improvised. Enter Michael J. Roberts with his Text Adventure Development System, or TADS."

    "Description": "By the point in late 1988 when Magnetic Scrolls released Fish!, their fifth text adventure and arguably their best yet, a distressing pattern of diminishing returns had already been well-established when it came to sales. Anita Sinclair’s little collective had peaked early in commercial if not in design terms, with the release of the illustrated version of their first game The Pawn in 1986. Indeed, alongside Infocom’s Leather Goddesses of Phobos, The Pawn had that year become one of the last two text adventures ever to generate sales sufficient to make the games industry at large sit up and pay attention. The performance of neither game had had all that much to do with its intrinsic design merits: sales of The Pawn had been driven by the timely appeal of its pretty pictures to people looking to show off their new Atari STs and Commodore Amigas, sales of Leather Goddesses by the timeless allure of sex to the largely adolescent male audience for computer games in general. Nevertheless, while for Infocom the year had been a welcome final hurrah that may very well have staved off their inevitable endgame for a year or more, for Magnetic Scrolls it had simply been one heck of an auspicious start."

To whatever extent their skills allowed, employees and their families tried to imitate the athletes portrayed in the new game, riding skateboards, throwing Frisbees, or kicking around a Hacky Sack. Meanwhile a professional BMX freestyler and a professional skateboarder did tricks to show them how it was really done. The partiers dressed in the most outrageous beachwear they could muster — typically for this hyper-competitive company, their outfits were judged for prizes — while the sound of the Beach Boys and the smell of grilling hamburgers and hotdogs filled the air. Folks from the other offices around Epyx’s came out to look on a little wistfully, doubtless wishing their company was as fun as this one. A good time was had by all, a memory made of one of those special golden days which come along from time to time to be carried along with us for the rest of our lives."

    "Description": "The computer-game industry, like most young industries, was marked by ebbs and flows. Periodically, new advances in technology, new economic circumstances, and new consumer expectations led to the mass extinction of companies that had once seemed impregnable, even as new companies swept onto the scene to replace them. We’ve already seen one of these periods of transition: the home-computer bust of the mid-1980s that followed the first home-computer boom. Now, just five years later in historical time, we’re about to see another as the 1980s become the 1990s. Under the pressure of Nintendo, the American computer-game industry in particular was redefining itself yet again in terms of platforms, technologies, and modes of play. Inevitably, the disruption brought with it its share of casualties, including among them a number of companies we’ve come to know well in earlier articles. I’ve recently told the story of how the text-adventure specialists Infocom and (in Britain) Level 9 met their end when people largely stopped buying text adventures. Over the course of the next few articles, I’ll be writing about some other endings. Lest that sound horribly depressing, do know that the stories of these failures are not so much stories of companies that did too little as of companies that tried to do too much. For, as Neil Young told us, “It’s better to burn out than to fade away.”"

Many an author naively assumes that the acquisition of films rights means an actual film will get made, and in fairly short order at that. And thus is many an author sorely disappointed. Almost every popular novelist who’s been around for a while has stories to tell about Hollywood’s unique form of development purgatory. The sad fact is that the cost of acquiring the rights to even the biggest bestseller is a drop in the bucket in comparison to the cost of making a film out of them. Indeed, the cost is so trivial in terms of Hollywood budgets that many studios are willing to splash out for rights to books they never seriously envision doing anything productive with at all, simply to keep them out of the hands of rivals and protect their own properties in similar genres."

    "Timestamp": "2019-02-27T18:55:53",
    "Domain": "fosdem.org",
    "Description": "In this presentation, we will talk about the Intel Hardware Intrinsics in .NET Core, a new feature in .NET Core 3.0. For the first time, .NET developers will have the ability to directly exercise underlying CPU features, very similar to what C/C++ developers could do with intrinsic functions for their performance critical code. The Intel Hardware Intrinsics in .NET Core include more than 1300 intrinsic functions, which cover the instruction set architecture (ISA) SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, FMA, LZCNT, POPCNT, BMI1, BMI2, PCLMULQDQ, and AES. Many of the intrinsic functions are designed for Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) computation, a common used technology to speed up computation intensive algorithms. To illustrate the benefits of using Hardware Intrinsics, we implemented a Structure of Array (SoA) based RayTracer and compared its performance with that of the traditional Array of Structure (AoS) based RayTracer which uses System.Numerics.Vectors. Our experience shows that significant performance improvement is possible when using Hardware Intrinsics for this particular application. Another use case is ML.NET, an open source machine learning framework for .NET developers, which leverages the Intel Hardware Intrinsics to simplify the acceleration of machine learning scenarios."
