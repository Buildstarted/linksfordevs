    "Description": "Why is everyone in such a rush?\n\nWalk into any bookstore, and you'll see how to Teach Yourself Java\nin 24 Hours alongside endless variations offering to teach C,\nSQL, Ruby, Algorithms, and so on in a few days or hours.  \nThe Amazon advanced search for [title: teach,\nyourself, hours, since: 2000 and found 512 such books. Of the top ten, nine are programming books (the other is about bookkeeping). Similar results come from replacing \"teach yourself\" with \"learn\" or \"hours\" with \"days.\"\n \n\nThe conclusion is that either people are in a big rush to learn\nabout programming, or that programming is somehow fabulously easier to\nlearn than anything else.  \nFelleisen et al.\ngive a nod to this trend in their book How to Design Programs, when they say\n\"Bad programming is easy. Idiots can learn it in 21 days,\neven if they are dummies.\" The Abtruse Goose comic also had their take.\n\nLet's analyze what a title like Teach Yourself C++ in 24 Hours\ncould mean:\n\n\nTeach Yourself: In 24 hours you won't have time to write several\nsignificant programs, and learn from your successes and failures with\nthem.  You won't have time to work with an experienced programmer and\nunderstand what it is like to live in a C++ environment.  In short, you\nwon't have time to learn much.  So the book can only be talking about a\nsuperficial familiarity, not a deep understanding. As Alexander Pope said,\na little learning is a dangerous thing.C++: In 24 hours you might be able to learn some of the syntax of\nC++ (if you already know another language), but you couldn't\nlearn much about how to use the language.  In short, if you were, say, a\nBasic programmer, you could learn to write programs in the style of\nBasic using C++ syntax, but you couldn't learn what C++ is\nactually good (and bad) for.  So what's the point?  Alan\nPerlis once said: \"A language that doesn't affect the way you\nthink about programming, is not worth knowing\".  One possible point is\nthat you have to learn a tiny bit of C++ (or more likely, something\nlike JavaScript or Processing) because you need to interface with an\nexisting tool to accomplish a specific task. But then you're not\nlearning how to program; you're learning to accomplish that task.in 24 Hours: Unfortunately, this is not enough, as the next\nsection shows.\n\n\nTeach Yourself Programming in Ten Years\n\nResearchers (Bloom\n(1985), Bryan & Harter (1899), Hayes\n(1989), Simmon & Chase (1973)) have shown it\ntakes about ten years to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of\nareas, including chess playing, music composition, telegraph\noperation, painting, piano playing, swimming, tennis, and research in\nneuropsychology and topology.  The key is deliberative\npractice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself\nwith a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it,\nanalyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting\nany mistakes.  Then repeat.  And repeat again.  There appear to be no\nreal shortcuts: even Mozart, who was a musical prodigy at age 4, took\n13 more years before he began to produce world-class music.  In\nanother genre, the Beatles seemed to burst onto the scene with a\nstring of #1 hits and an appearance on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964.\nBut they had been playing small clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg since\n1957, and while they had mass appeal early on, their first great\ncritical success, Sgt. Peppers, was released in 1967. \n\nMalcolm\nGladwell has popularized the idea, although he concentrates on 10,000 hours, not 10 years.\nHenri Cartier-Bresson (1908-2004) had another metric: \"Your first 10,000 photographs are your  worst.\" (He didn't\nanticipate that with digital cameras, some people can reach that mark in a week.)\nTrue expertise may take a lifetime:\nSamuel Johnson (1709-1784) said \"Excellence in any department can be\nattained only by the labor of a lifetime; it is not to be purchased at\na lesser price.\"  And Chaucer (1340-1400) complained \"the lyf so short, the craft\nso long to lerne.\" Hippocrates (c. 400BC) is known for the excerpt \"ars longa,\nvita brevis\", which is part of the longer quotation \"Ars longa, vita\nbrevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium\ndifficile\", which in English renders as \"Life is short, [the] craft\nlong, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment\ndifficult.\"  \n\nOf course, no single number can be the final answer: it doesn't seem reasonable\nto assume that all skills (e.g., programming, chess playing, checkers playing, and music playing)\ncould all require exactly the same amount of time to master, nor that all people\nwill take exactly the same amount of time. As \nProf. \nK. Anders Ericsson puts it, \"In most domains it's remarkable how much time even the most\ntalented individuals need in order to reach the highest levels of performance. The 10,000 hour number just gives you a sense that we're talking years of 10 to 20 hours a week which those who some people would argue are the most innately talented individuals still need to get to the highest level.\"\n\nSo You Want to be a Programmer\n\nHere's my recipe for programming success:\n\n\n Get interested in programming, and do some because it is fun.  Make sure\nthat it keeps being enough fun so that you will be willing to put in your ten years/10,000 hours. Program.  The best kind of learning is learning\nby doing.  To put it more technically, \"the maximal level of\nperformance for individuals in a given domain is not attained\nautomatically as a function of extended experience, but the level of\nperformance can be increased even by highly experienced individuals as\na result of deliberate efforts to improve.\" (p. 366)\nand \"the most effective learning requires a well-defined task with an\nappropriate difficulty level for the particular individual,\ninformative feedback, and opportunities for repetition and corrections\nof errors.\" (p. 20-21)  The book \nCognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics, and Culture in Everyday\nLife is an interesting \nreference for this viewpoint. Talk with other programmers; read other programs.  This is more important\nthan any book or training course. If you want, put in four years at a college (or more at a\ngraduate school).  This will give you access to some jobs that require\ncredentials, and it will give you a deeper understanding of the field,\nbut if you don't enjoy school, you can (with some dedication) get\nsimilar experience on your own or on the job. In any case, book learning alone won't\nbe enough. \"Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert\nprogrammer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make\nsomebody an expert painter\" says Eric Raymond, author of The New\nHacker's Dictionary. One of the best programmers I ever hired had\nonly a High School degree; he's produced a lot of great software, has his own news group, and made enough in stock options to buy his own nightclub. Work on projects with other programmers. Be the best programmer\non some projects; be the worst on some others.  When you're the best,\nyou get to test your abilities to lead a project, and to inspire\nothers with your vision.  When you're the worst, you learn what the\nmasters do, and you learn what they don't like to do (because they\nmake you do it for them). Work on projects after other programmers. \nUnderstand a program written by someone else. See what it takes to\nunderstand and fix it when the original programmers are not\naround. Think about how to design your programs to make it easier for\nthose who will maintain them after you. Learn at least a half dozen programming languages.  Include one\nlanguage that emphasizes class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that\nemphasizes functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML or Haskell), one\nthat supports syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one\nthat supports declarative specifications (like Prolog or C++\ntemplates), and\none that emphasizes parallelism (like Clojure or Go).   Remember that there is a \"computer\" in \"computer science\". Know\nhow long it takes your computer to execute an instruction, fetch a\nword from memory (with and without a cache miss), read consecutive words from disk, and seek to a new location on disk. (Answers here.)  Get involved in a language\nstandardization effort.  It could be the ANSI C++ committee, or it\ncould be deciding if your local coding style will have 2 or 4 space\nindentation levels.  Either way, you learn about what other people\nlike in a language, how deeply they feel so, and perhaps even a little\nabout why they feel so. Have the good sense to get off the language standardization effort as\nquickly as possible.\n\n\nWith all that in mind, its questionable how far you can get just by\nbook learning.  Before my first child was born, I read all the How\nTo books, and still felt like a clueless novice.  30 Months later,\nwhen my second child was due, did I go back to the books for a\nrefresher? No.  Instead, I relied on my personal experience, which\nturned out to be far more useful  and reassuring\nto me than the thousands of pages written\nby experts.\n\nFred Brooks, in his essay No Silver Bullet \nidentified a three-part plan for finding great\nsoftware designers:\n\n\n   Systematically identify top designers as early as possible.Assign a career mentor to be responsible for the development of the prospect and carefully keep a career file.Provide opportunities for growing designers to interact and stimulate each other.\n\nThis assumes that some people already have the qualities necessary for\nbeing a great designer; the job is to properly coax them along.  Alan\nPerlis put it more succinctly: \"Everyone can be taught to sculpt:\nMichelangelo would have had to be taught how not to. So it is with the\ngreat programmers\".  Perlis is saying that the greats have some\ninternal quality that transcends their training.  But where does the\nquality come from?  Is it innate?  Or do they develop it through\ndiligence?  As Auguste Gusteau (the fictional chef in\nRatatouille) puts it, \"anyone can cook, but only the fearless\ncan be great.\"  I think of it more as willingness to devote a large\nportion of one's life to deliberative practice.  But maybe\nfearless is a way to summarize that. Or, as Gusteau's critic,\nAnton Ego, says: \"Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great\nartist can come from anywhere.\"\n\n\nSo go ahead and buy that Java/Ruby/Javascript/PHP book; you'll\nprobably get some use out of it.  But you won't change your life, or\nyour real overall expertise as a programmer in 24 hours or 21 days.  \nHow about working hard to continually improve over 24 months?\nWell, now you're starting to get somewhere...\n\nReferences\n\n\nBloom, Benjamin (ed.)

When asked \"what operating system should\nI use, Windows, Unix, or Mac?\", my answer is usually: \"use whatever\nyour friends use.\"  The advantage you get from learning from your\nfriends will offset any intrinsic difference between OS, or\nbetween programming languages.  Also consider your future friends:\nthe community of programmers that you will be a part of if you\ncontinue.  Does your chosen language have a large growing community\nor a small dying one?  Are there books, web sites, and online forums\nto get answers from?  Do you like the people in those forums?\n\nKeep it simple.  Programming languages such as C++\nand Java are designed for professional development by large teams of\nexperienced programmers who are concerned about the run-time efficiency of\ntheir code.\nAs a result, these languages have complicated parts designed for these circumstances.\nYou're concerned with learning to program.  You don't need that complication.\nYou want a language that was designed to be easy to learn and remember by a\nsingle new programmer.\n\nPlay. Which way would you rather learn to play the piano: the\nnormal, interactive way, in which you hear each note as soon as you hit a key,\nor \"batch\" mode, in which you only hear the notes after you finish a whole song?\nClearly, interactive mode makes learning easier for the piano, and also for \nprogramming. Insist on a language with an interactive mode and use it.\n\n\n\nGiven these criteria, my recommendations for a first programming\nlanguage would be Python or\nScheme.  \nAnother choice is Javascript, not because it is perfectly well-designed for beginners,\nbut because there are so many online tutorials for it, such as \nKhan Academy's tutorial.\nBut your\ncircumstances may vary, and there are other good choices. If your\nage is a single-digit, you might prefer\nAlice or Squeak \nor Blockly (older learners might also enjoy these). The important\nthing is that you choose and get started.\n\n\n\nAppendix: Books and Other Resources\n\n\nSeveral people have asked what books and web pages they should learn\nfrom.  I repeat that \"book learning alone won't be enough\" but I can\nrecommend the following:\n\n\n Scheme: Structure and\nInterpretation of Computer Programs (Abelson & Sussman) is\nprobably the best introduction to computer science, and it does\nteach programming as a way of understanding the computer science. \nYou can see online videos of lectures on this book, as well as the complete text online. The book is\nchallenging and will weed out some people who perhaps could be\nsuccessful with another approach.  \n\n Scheme:\nHow to\nDesign Programs (Felleisen et al.) is one of the best books\non how to actually design programs in an elegant and functional way.\n\n Python: \nPython Programming:\nAn Intro to CS (Zelle) is a good introduction using Python.  \n\n Python: Several\nonline tutorials\n are available at Python.org.\n\n Oz: Concepts,\nTechniques, and Models of Computer Programming (Van Roy & Haridi)\nis seen by some as the modern-day successor to Abelson & Sussman.\nIt is a tour through the big ideas of programming, covering a wider\nrange than Abelson & Sussman while being perhaps easier to read and\nfollow.  It uses a language, Oz, that is not widely known but serves as\na basis for learning other languages.\n\n<\n\n\n\nNotes\nT. Capey points out that the Complete\n  Problem Solver page on Amazon now has the \"Teach Yourself\n  Bengali in 21 days\" and \"Teach Yourself Grammar and Style\" books under the\n  \"Customers who shopped for this item also shopped for these items\"\n  section.  I guess that a large portion of the people who look at that\n  book are coming from this page.\nThanks to Ross Cohen for help with Hippocrates.\n\n\n\n          \n\nTranslations\nThanks to the\nfollowing authors,\ntranslations of \nthis page are\navailable in:\n\n\nArabic(Mohamed A.
