However, the\n                        complexity of team coordination and the variety of conditions present in popular game maps\n                        make it impractical to author hand-crafted movement policies for every scenario. We show\n                        that it is possible to take a data-driven approach to creating human-like movement\n                        controllers for CS:GO. We curate a team movement dataset comprising 123 hours of\n                        professional game play traces, and use this dataset to train a transformer-based movement\n                        model that generates human-like team movement for all players in a \"Retakes\" round of the\n                        game. Importantly, the movement prediction model is efficient. Performing inference for all\n                        players takes less than 0.5 ms per game step (amortized cost) on a single CPU core, making\n                        it plausible for use in commercial games today. Human evaluators assess that our model\n                        behaves more like humans than both commercially-available bots and procedural movement\n                        controllers scripted by experts (16% to 59% higher by TrueSkill rating of \"human-like\").\n                        Using experiments involving in-game bot vs. bot self-play, we demonstrate that our model\n                        performs simple forms of teamwork, makes fewer common movement mistakes, and yields movement\n                        distributions, player lifetimes, and kill locations similar to those observed in\n                        professional CS:GO match play.",
