I also love that it got started because one of the Riot guys plays a ton of Old School RuneScape and thinks our wiki is awesome. How cool is that?? I want this to kick off a new era where communities and developers take control from Fandom, and make some really great wikis. We’ve already been doing a bit of this, starting when we helped the Minecraft Wiki leave Fandom, but I think it’s time for me (and the rest of our group) to be more explicit about what we want to do.",
