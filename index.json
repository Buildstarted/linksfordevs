In the realm of web apps, we’re always trying to determine whether it’s better to handle everything on the server or shift as much as possible to the browser. This discussion isn’t just about technology—it’s about maintaining manageable code, keeping our sanity intact, and ensuring our users are happy. Enter the Simplicity-First philosophy, which reminds us that while fancy frameworks and cutting-edge libraries are appealing, they become useless if they overwhelm our code with excessive complexity. Simplicity-First is the sidekick that shows up with a utility belt full of best practices: naming things well, writing readable functions, and structuring elements so that future you (or your teammates) don’t have to pull out their hair. Buckle up as we embark on a journey through the history of server-side vs. client-side, explore why understanding your domain is crucial, and discover how new tools like htmx or server-first frameworks might bring peace to the galaxy.",
