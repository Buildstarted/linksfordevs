Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt\nGet the source code here: https://www.patreon.com/milanjovanovic\n\nDive into the future of API documentation in .NET 9 as we explore powerful alternatives to traditional Swagger UI. In this video, we'll walk through implementing OpenAPI with three different documentation tools: Swagger UI, ReDoc, and the game-changing Scalar interface. Learn how to seamlessly integrate these tools with .NET Aspire, boost your API documentation workflow, and implement custom commands that will streamline your development process. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with API development, this tutorial covers everything from basic setup to advanced integration techniques. We'll demonstrate how to leverage these tools to create beautiful, interactive API documentation that your team and clients will love.\n\n.NET Aspire: A Game-Changer for Cloud-Native Development?\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/dotnet-aspire-a-game-changer-for-cloud-native-development\n\nCheck out my courses:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/courses\n\nRead my Blog here:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog\n\nJoin my weekly .NET newsletter:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech\n\nChapters\n0:00 Exploring OpenAPI in .NET 9\n1:27 Adding Swagger, ReDoc and Scalar\n4:01 Integrating OpenAPI with Aspire\n8:12 Custom Commands implementation",
