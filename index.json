The proliferation of computers leads directly\nto a familiar problem, though: the files we want are always on the wrong\nmachine.  One solution is synchronization services that keep a set of files\nup to date across a multitude of machines; a number of companies have\ncreated successful commercial offerings based on such services.  Some of\nus, though, are stubbornly resistant to the idea of placing our data in the\nhands of corporations and their proprietary systems.  For those of us who\nwould rather stay in control of our data, systems like Syncthing offer a possible solution."
