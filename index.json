This shouldn't be possible using a standard latent diffusion model, which would generate the whole image at once. What could they be doing different? As why is it better?",

I’ve run content blocking extensions since they were first introduced and I’ve never looked back.\n\nSafari 15, released in September 2021, was the first version to support extensions, including content blocking extensions. This was a huge improvement to mobile browsing on iOS, which doesn’t offer any choice of browser besides Safari. Safari finally had a way to fight back against intrusive ads just like other browsers. I chose to use 1Blocker, which was highly reviewed by Apple aficionados at the time, though I’m sure there are other good alternatives.\n\n",

With the rise of “vibe coding”, where AI tools are used transform a basic idea into a functional app or website almost instantly for fun, it seems that any basic concept for a digital product can now be cloned on the spot. The barrier to entry has dropped dramatically, while the bar for uniqueness has risen just as fast. Any simple enough product can be replicated instantly.
