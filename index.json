    "Description": "Modern large language models (like ChatGPT) learn to generate new samples by modeling the data distribution of natural text. However, the underlying methodology has largely remained stagnant over the last century: although different architectures have been developed, models are all based on autoregressive modeling (i.e. next token prediction). In this blog post, I will talk about our work on Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion models, an alternative probablistic modeling technique that achieves highly competitive performance (at the scale of GPT-2) while introducing distinct algorithmic benefits. Our empirical results challenge the longstanding dominance of autoregressive modeling and can potentially pave the way for an alternative class of language models built from radically different principles.",
