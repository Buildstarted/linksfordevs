But when it comes to LLMs, traditional approaches to evaluation don’t work as cleanly as they do for other software systems.\nOf course, evals and benchmarks are an important signal (perhaps the only signal) of raw capability. They show us improvement over time. The fact that many of the original benchmarks from a year or so ago are at or near saturation also tells us a lot.",
