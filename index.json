    "Description": "This article shows you how to monitor Azure WebJobs using Azure Application Insights. WebJobs is a feature of Azure App Service that enables you to run a program or script in the same instance as a web app, API app, or mobile app. There is no additional cost to use WebJobs. If you‚Äôre using Azure WebJobs monitoring WebJobs is little hard. You might need to login into Kudu and need to check the status. Recently I had to implement a solution which helps me to monitor Azure WebJobs. Basically by monitoring Web Jobs I wanted to verify whether the service is able to complete the operation successfully or it is still running or it is failed. In this post I am using Azure Application Insights and Kudu REST API to monitor the availability of the Web Jobs. You will be using the Availability feature of Application Insights with the help of MultiStep tests."
