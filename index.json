The go word orchestrates an edit-reload cycle: go#empty is the clever bit. It evaluate-s the string \"---marker--- marker ---marker---\". This first runs the existing ---marker--- (clearing definitions from the previous load of my_project.fs). Then it defines a new ---marker--- at the now-empty top of the dictionary, priming it for the next cycle. go#open uses gforth’s system to open my_project.fs in vim. go#run uses included to load the freshly edited my_project.fs.",
