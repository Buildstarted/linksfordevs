It’s when you’re in the zone, seemingly effortlessly producing code.\nIt’s the idea that you can create great software simply by immersing yourself in the feeling of coding, trusting your intuition and riding the wave of inspiration. But lately, I’ve realized that for me, at least, the vibe is…off.",

As I dug through layers of functions, I suddenly realized — unlike the new generation of developers, I was grateful that I could actually understand my codebase. That’s when I started thinking more about Karpathy’s recent statements on vibe coding. For those who missed it, Andrej Karpathy recently shared his thoughts on what he calls “vibe coding” — essentially surrendering code comprehension to AI tools and hoping for the best. His exact words? “I ‘Accept All’ always, I don’t read the diffs anymore.” I have learnt a lot from Karpathy and use AI tools daily, but there’s a world of difference between augmenting your capabilities and completely surrendering your understanding.",
