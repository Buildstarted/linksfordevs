Pieces clip and snap together.\nIt's a demonstration that it is very important to consider forces and material properties already when designing a mechanical object. Hints about proper design are presented in my video:\nhttps://youtu.be/mziT7KV-fRI\nThe video also includes explanations how to assemble this vise.\nFor 3d-printing it's recommended to print 3 shell layers. 35% infill is sufficient. All the forces for clamping a workpiece are only active at the outer surface - more infill doesn't make the vise more robust. Layer height is 0.15 mm (maybe screws are better printed with 0.1mm layers). No support material needed. Printed with 0.4 mm nozzle.\nAssembly: https://jig.space/view?jig=1216 (thanks to http://www.thingiverse.com/greenlig)\nDesigned with Fusion 360: http://a360.co/2juhSUG\nIf there are difficulties to print the threaded rods vertically, I've designed a version of the sliding jaw with horizontally printed rods: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2123529"
