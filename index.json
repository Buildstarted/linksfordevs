The standard explanation for how the internet works, if you're not looking in thick technical books that require you to already know the answer before you can read it, is that \"you enter the domain name \"google.com\" into your browser, then the browser asks a \"DNS server\" to convert that domain name to an IP address, which is a type of address that your computer understands\" and then everything works. But it still doesn't explain why the data takes certain paths, and what makes it do it, which is weird because that's what the internet is: Data taking different paths between computers all around the world. There are billions of computers and they obviously need to keep track of where the other billions of computers are. How is it possible?",

    "Description": "In 2017, we looked at how web bloat affects users with slow connections. Even in the U.S., many users didn't have broadband speeds, making much of the web difficult to use. It's still the case that many users don't have broadband speeds, both inside and outside of the U.S. and that much of the modern web isn't usable for people with slow internet, but the exponential increase in bandwidth (Neilsen suggests this is 50% per year for high-end connections) has outpaced web bloat for typical sites, making this less of a problem than it was in 2017, although it's still a serious problem for people with poor connections.",
