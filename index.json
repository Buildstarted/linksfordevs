    "Description": "Since the introduction of Nix and similar store-based systems such as Guix or Spack, I have been fascinated about finding improvements that take advantage of the new paradigms they introduce. Linux distributions are traditionally dynamic in nature, with shared libraries and executables being linked at runtime. Store-based systems, however, are static in nature, with all dependencies being resolved at build time. This determinism allows for not only reproducibility but also the ability to optimize various aspects of our toolchain. Work that I‚Äôve have written previously about shows that there are worthwhile speedups that can be gained. While previously, I focused on improving the stat storm that occurs when resolving dependencies, I have recently been looking at speeding up the ELF relocations that occur when executing a program. You can check out my publication Mapping Out the HPC Dependency Chaos about the development of shrinkwrap if you are interested in the topic. Extending the idea further, I have been looking at how we can optimize the ELF relocations that occur when executing a program. In this post, I will discuss the basics of ELF relocations and symbol resolution and how we can optimize these processes for store-based systems.",
