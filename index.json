These vulnerabilities enable non-privileged users to leak the contents of kernel pool and kernel stack, write to arbitrary kernel memory, and, the most interesting, read and write physical memory from user mode via the DMA capability of the device. The vulnerabilities have remained undisclosed for years, affecting many OEMs, including Dell, Lenovo, and others. If your laptop is equipped with an SD card reader, it is highly likely to be manufactured by Realtek, making it susceptible to these vulnerabilities as well.",
