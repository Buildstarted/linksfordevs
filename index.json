    "Description": "Folks are starting to figure out what kind of environment AI agents need to be productive. The gist is:\nAgents need clear guidelines in a markdown file at the root of the repository explaining how to contribute to the project. Agents need a clean, isolated, reproducible environment in which they can run tests and go wild without breaking stuff and getting stuck. If the environments are sufficiently isolated, you can run them in parallel and allow multiple agents to work concurrently. Agents need fast tools so they can get feedback quickly. Tests should run fast. Speed of the iteration loop is everything. Documentation and code comments help agents figure out what’s going on. Agents work best with small contained tasks which can be reviewed and deployed continuously, rather than in huge risky chunks. What’s maddening is, if you replace the word “agents” with “humans”, all these sentences are equally true, if not more so.",
