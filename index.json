    "Description": "The Plan 9 CD-ROM needed about 100MB for the full distribution, if that. We\nhatched a plan to fill up the rest with encoded music and include the\nsoftware to decode it. (We wanted to get the encoder out too, but lawyers\nstood in the way. Keep reading.) Using connections I had with folks in the\narea, and some very helpful friends in the music business, I got permission\nto distribute several hours of existing recorded stuff from groups like the\nResidents and Wire. Lou Reed gave a couple of pieces too - he was very\ninterested in Ken and Sean's work (which, it should be noted, was built on\ngroundbreaking work done in the acoustics center at Bell Labs) and visited\nus to check it out. Debby Harry even recorded an original song for us in\nthe studio.\n\nWe had permission for all this of course, and releases from everyone\ninvolved. It was very exciting.\n\nSo naturally, just before release, an asshole (I am being kind) lawyer at\nAT&T headquarters in Manhattan stopped the project cold. In a phone call\nthat treated me as shabbily as I have ever been, he said he didn't know who\nthese \"assholes\" (again, but this time his term) were and therefore the\nreleases were meaningless because anyone could have written them.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is why MP-3 took off instead of the far better\nfollow-on system we were on the cusp of getting out the door.\n\n-rob\n\nP.S. No, I don't have the music any more. Too sad to keep.\n\n\nOn Wed, Jun 22, 2022 at 12:19 PM Andrew Hume &lt;andrew(a)humeweb.com&gt; wrote:",
