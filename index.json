    "Description": "I host a few small low-traffic websites for local interests. I do this for free\n- and some of them are for a friend who died last year but didn’t want all his\nwork to vanish. They don’t get so many views, so I was surprised when I happened\nto glance at munin and saw my bandwidth usage had gone up a lot. I spent a\ncouple of hours working to solve this and did everything wrong. But it was a\nuseful learning experience and I thought it might be worth sharing in case\nanyone else encounters similar. My setup is: Cloudflare DNS -> Cloudflare Tunnel\n(Because my residential isp uses CGNAT) -> Haproxy (I like Haproxy and amongst\nother things, alerts me when a site is down) -> Separate Docker containers for\neach website. On a Debian server living in my garage. From Haproxy’s stats page,\nI was able to see which website was gathering attention. It’s one running PhpBB\nfor a little forum. Tailing apache’s logs in that container quickly identified\nthe pattern and made it easy to see what was happening. It was seeing a lot of\n404 errors for URLs all coming from the same user-agent “claudebot”. I know what\nyou’re thinking - it’s an exploit scanning bot, but a closer look showed it was\ntrying to fetch normal forum posts, some which had been deleted months\npreviously, and also robots.txt. That site doesn’t have a robots.txt so that was\nfailing. What was weird is that the it was requesting at a rate of up to 20 urls\na second, from multiple AWS IPs - and every other request was for robots.txt.\nYou’d think it would take the hint after a million times of asking. Googling\nthat UA turns up that other PhpBB users have encountered this quite recently -\nit seems to be fascinated by web forums and absolutely hammers them with the\nsame behaviour I found. So - clearly a broken and stupid bot, right? Rather than\nbeing specifically malicious. I think so, but I host these sites on a rural\nconsumer line and it was affecting both system load and bandwidth. What I did\nwrong: 1. In docker, I tried quite a few things to block the user agent, the\ncountry (US based AWS, and this is a UK regional site), various IPs. It took me\nfar too long to realise why my changes to .htaccess were failing - the phpbb\ndocker image I use mounts the root directory to the website internally, ignoring\nmy mounted vol. (My own fault, it was too long since I set it up to remember\nonly certain sub-dirs were mounted in)\n2. Figuring that out, I shelled into the container and edited that .htaccess,\nbut wouldn’t have survived restarting/rebuilding the container so wasn’t a real\nsolution. Whilst I was in there, I created a robots.txt file. Not surprisingly,\nclaudebot doesn’t actually honour whats in there, and still continues to request\nit ten times a second. 3. Thinking there must be another way, I switched to\nHaproxy. This was much easier - the documentation is very good. And it actually\nworked - blocking by Useragent (and yep, I’m lucky this wasn’t changing) worked\nperfectly. I then had to leave for a while and the graphs show it’s working.\n(Yellow above the line is requests coming into haproxy, below the line are\nresponses).\n[https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/2bc99426-0356-4010-a0e5-f7b8dbfeb14a.png] Great -\nexcept I’m still seeing half of the traffic, and that’s affecting my latency.\n(Some of you might doubt this, and I can tell you that you’re spoiled by an\nexcess of bandwidth…) 4. That’s when the penny dropped and the obvious occured.\nI use cloudflare, so use their firewall, right? No excuses - I should have gone\nthere first. In fact, I did, but I got distracted by the many options and\nfocused on their bot fighting tools, which didn’t work for me. (This bot is\nsomehow getting through the captcha challenge even when bot fight mode is\nenabled) But, their firewall has an option for user agent. The actual fix was\nsimply to add this in WAF for that domain.\n[https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/98041b82-de04-4cdc-bfb1-05f4e5656903.png] And\nvoila - no more traffic through the tunnel for this very rude and stupid bot.\nAfter 24 hours, Cloudflare has blocked almost a quarter of a million requests by\nclaudebot to my little phpbb forum which barely gets a single post every three\nmonths.\n[https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/f3170d6c-fec1-4820-9fbb-b54b14db46f8.png] Moral\nfor myself: Stand back and think for a minute before rushing in and trying to\nfix something in the wrong way. I’ve also taken this as an opportunity to\nimprove haproxy’s rate limiting internally. Like most website hosts, most of my\ntraffic is outbound, and slowing things down when it gets busy really does help.\nThis obviously isn’t a perfect solution - all claudebot has to do is change its\nUA, and by coming from AWS it’s pretty hard to block otherwise. One hopes it\nisn’t truly malicious. It would be quite a lot more work to integrate Fail2ban\nfor more bots, but it might yet come to that. Also, if you write any kind of web\nbot, please consider that not everyone who hosts a website has a lot of\nbandwidth, and at least have enough pride to write software good enough to not\nkeep doing the same thing every second. And, y’know, keep an eye on what your\nstuff is doing out on the internet - not least for your own benefit. Hopefully\nAWS really shaft claudebot’s owners with some big bandwidth charges… EDIT: It\ncame back the next day with a new UA, and an email address linking it to\nanthropic.com [http://anthropic.com] - the Claude3 AI bot, so it looks like a\nparticularly badly written scraper for AI learning.",
