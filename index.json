    "Timestamp": "2023-04-17T23:01:52",

    "Description": "As we discovered in my last article, Nim will by default generate C code and then call on a C compiler to actually produce a binary. This might seem like an odd choice, especially in the age of LLVM. However itâ€™s actually not uncommon for languages to compile or transpile into another language. Initially the choice to not use LLVM was simply because it wasnâ€™t as mature back when Nim was created. Though going through C has some quite substantial benefits. For example youâ€™re able to run Nim anywhere you can run C, which means you can run it pretty much anywhere. From the tiniest micro-controllers, to mobile apps, to normal desktop/server targets1. There is another benefit though which this article focuses on, namely the ability to super easily interface with C libraries or programs. This is whatâ€™s called a foreign function interface or FFI and just means weâ€™re calling functions from another language, in this case Nim from C, or C from Nim. Of course the Nim language has quite a few extra features and systems compared to C, so when using a library written in C we often want to do a little bit of translation work in order to make the interface a bit more familiar to Nim users2. Especially when it comes to things like memory management, and things like async. In this article Iâ€™ll outline how this works in practice, and show some examples from wrapping the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) library in Nim.",

    "Description": "In which I argue for stronger software engineering skills in cybersecurity, and a focus on data engineering. My initial foray in the world of detection & response occurred in the mid-2000s, when the field of cybersecurity was still nascent and white hats were figuring out how to industrialize defensive techniques. Back then, the job of a security engineer was to deploy intrusion detection systems across the network and write simple rules that would typically match on IP address or signature hashes. alert udp $EXTERNAL_NET 53 -> $HOME_NET any ( msg:\"DNS SPOOF query response PTR with TTL of 1 min. and no authority\"; content:\"|85 80 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 00|\"; content:\"|C0 0C 00 0C 00 01 00 00 00|<|00 0F|\"; classtype:bad-unknown; sid:253; rev:4; ) an example of snort rule that alerts on suspicious DNS traffic Security engineers focused primarily on network infrastructure and threat intelligence. Aggregating IOCs, applying rules to well-placed sensors and investigating alerts was an analystâ€™s primary focus. Youâ€™d place tripwires all over the place, and wait for an attacker to trigger an alert. This seems to have served us well for a long time. We refined it over the years, with more sophisticated alert languages, frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK that helped organize threats, log aggregation systems like Splunk, etc. And judging by the content of most BSides conferences, it is still the go-to approach for a lot of teams out there. However, my observation over the past five years, first building the threat detection pipeline at Mozilla, then running the Cloud Detection team at Google, is that detection & response has shifted to focus on data driven detection engineering. The future of D&R leverages complex data models using sophisticated pipelines to detect threats in anomalous behaviors. And, as an industry, weâ€™re not ready for it.",

The address the reset vector points to will typically be some form of ROM or flash that can be read by the CPU even if no other hardware has been configured yet.
