But here’s the kicker – it’s about as realistic as expecting your computer to make you a sandwich when you hit Ctrl+Alt+Delicious.\nThe Myth of the Coding Hermit\nLet’s face it, we’ve all dreamed of being that lone wolf developer at some point. I know I have – there was a time when I thought I could conquer the coding world armed with nothing but my trusty laptop and an unhealthy amount of caffeine. Spoiler alert: it didn’t end well. My code looked like it had been written by a caffeinated squirrel, and my only collaborator was my increasingly concerned houseplant.",
