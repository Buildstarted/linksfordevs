    "Domain": "www.ndra.dev",
    "Description": "My calendar is full of meetings and for various reasons, I find it difficult to skip them. Some of those meetings help me build context (or keep it up to date) around an area that I care about. Others are there to build and maintain relationships. As a remote worker, I no longer have a space to talk to peers on the way to lunch or while grabbing coffee, so 1:1s fill that purpose too. With the amount of meetings in my calendar, I don’t have clarity about which meetings actually need my real-time presence. This is particularly troublesome when there are conflicts and I need to pick 1 of 2 (or sometimes 3) meetings to attend. I need a system to decide: Is this important? Do I need to be there in real time? Can I just read the notes afterward? Every meeting invite looks the same in my calendar. A 30-minute block with a vague title and a list of attendees. No indication of whether I’m there to make decisions, provide context, or just stay informed. This forces me to make attendance decisions with incomplete information. I end up in meetings where I contribute nothing, while missing others where my input was actually needed. I’ve been thinking about this for a few months now and finally wrote down some notes on what I would like to see in every calendar entry. I came up with a template and the first iteration is this: # Daniel's Experimental Meeting Template ## Meeting Notes *Specify the location of the meeting notes. It may be an attached document, a wiki page, a tab in a document or a shared folder.* ## Attendees *Who will find value from attending this meeting? It could be a project manager, designer, stakeholders for a project, your team or engineers working on a specific platform.* ## Pre-work *What should attendees prepare before the meeting? Should they come with a list of questions? Or read a document?* ## Type of Meeting *What is the primary purpose for this meeting? This helps set expectations for participants.* - [ ] Fact-finding - Gathering information, understanding current state, identifying unknowns - [ ] Decision-making - Making choices with clear authority and accountability - [ ] Consensus-building - Aligning on approach through discussion and agreement - [ ] Context sharing - Providing updates, knowledge transfer, or background information - [ ] Status update - Reporting progress, blockers, and next steps - [ ] Dry run - Practice or preparation for upcoming meeting or presentation - [ ] 1:1 - One-on-one discussion (career development, feedback, relationship building) - [ ] Other: ________________ ## Agenda *Create a time-boxed agenda to keep the meeting focused. If the meeting is at risk of going over the allotted time, schedule a separate meeting or resolve the remaining issues offline.* Example: - 2-5 minutes: Review action items from the previous meeting - 5-15 minutes: Discussion on [main topic] - 5 minutes: Pulse check on [specific area - project health, blockers, team sentiment] ## Purpose *Write one to three sentences describing what this meeting is intended to accomplish. Include what is NOT in scope to prevent scope creep.* Example: The meeting is intended to discuss the development status and challenges of [project]. This is not a meeting to explore or make decisions on other projects. ## Exit Criteria *When should this recurring meeting end or evolve?* Example: This meeting will stop once Project ABC is either shipped or rolled back. ## Related Meetings *List other meetings where this topic might come up. This may be a platform sync, team meeting, or org-wide meeting.*",
