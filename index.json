    "Description": "In early 2020, most of the world was concerned with matters of great import, myself included. But three men, Filipe Coelho, David Runge, and Nils Hilbrect had more trivial things on their minds. At this time they came to me, not announcing themselves as a formal alliance, but pretending to be separate, disconnected parties suddenly showing up all at once. Each one had a list of demands for changes that I should make to NSM. I responded politely to each of these demands in turn, inquiring about why they believed them to be necessary, important, or appropriate, and I offered detailed explanations as to how they were not. They refused to participate in a discourse and reiterated their demands. I asked them why, if these trivial matters were so important to them, did they come to me with demands instead of patches to contribute? They became irate and threatened to fork my project. But of course, because they apparently lacked either the skill or the intention to make the changes themselves (as contributions), I didn't take this threat seriously, as creating a fork would require them to actually do something."

    "Description": "Richard is a Principal Program Manager on the .NET Core team at Microsoft. He's been with Microsoft for a total of 21 years, 18 of which have been with the .NET team (since 2003 when the codename was Whidbey!) Richard is truly a mover and shaker when it comes to pushing the .NET platform forward! Currently, he’s working on runtime features and performance, CLI experience, docker container experience, ARM32 and ARM64 support, IoT/GPIO/PWM support, blogging and customer engagement, and speaking at conferences. He's also part of the design team that defines new .NET runtime capabilities and features. And in his spare time, he enjoys British rock and Doctor Who! &nbsp; A lot has changed since Richard was last on the show! In this episode, he is here to discuss all of the changes to the new .NET platform, how he’s continuing to push the .NET platform forward together with his team, the current state-of-the-art tools and techniques in the .NET IoT space and .NET applications, exciting developments with his current .NET blog series on DevBlogs.Microsoft.com, and much more! &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:14] About The Azure DevOps Podcast, Clear Measure, the new podcast Architect Tips, and Jeffrey’s offer to speak at virtual user groups.
