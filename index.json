How are you not irresistibly \n> interested in that?? I would've interrogated that relative so hard\nIt just came up in passing at Thanksgiving! I don't really know him \nthat \nwell; he's an in-law. He mentioned being able to throw small washers and \nbolts at the field and watching them get repelled. People got \ninterested, and so someone came with a voltmeter, and after throwing a \ncouple more, they checked for voltage, and there was a residual charge \nafter they finally caught on on a plastic sheet to prevent immediate \ngrounding. It also had a very slight magnetic field. It's apparently \nfairly common, but engineering hasn't come up with a solid explanation \nwhy.",
