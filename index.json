The process of building a Linux Distribution can be pretty tough and making a quality and usable product is another argument entirely. With some aggressive google searching, I was able to find a list of the best Linux distro building kits. Before you start building any distros it may be a good idea to look into how KVM works and learn the models behind the Linux Kernel Architecture. Moving on, I happened to stumble upon a decent and easy-to-use Ubuntu ISO Creator. This app gives you the ability to reconcile your settings and updates before the disk has been created. Let’s take a closer look at what building a Ubuntu distro was like, using Cubic. You’re going to need a Linux machine and for this lab, so I’ll be firing up a virtual machine and allocating the necessary RAM and Processing speed to create an ISO image. You will also need a blank ISO to build your custom distro with, I downloaded a bare-bones Xubuntu ISO here. The keys and installation methods:",

As a result, every few years, the suggestion of building smaller, cheaper carriers comes up.  In recent years, these have gotten louder, driven in large part by the development of the F-35B, which can operate without the need for catapults or arresting gear and offers capability unmatched outside the F-35 family.  There have even been tests with USS America, normally an amphibious helicopter carrier, serving as a “Lightning Carrier”.  Unfortunately, there are serious practical problems with all of this.  The simple fact is that there are major economies of scale in carrier aviation, and STOVL isn’t going to remove them, nor is something like America, lovely though she is, a good substitute for the CVNs.",
