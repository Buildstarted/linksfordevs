Othello has roughly ten octodecillion (10\nto the 58th power) possible game records and ten octillion (10 to the 28th\npower) possible game position. The challenge of solving Othello, determining\nthe outcome of a game with no mistake made by either player, has long been a\ngrand challenge in computer science. This paper announces a significant\nmilestone: Othello is now solved, computationally proved that perfect play by\nboth players lead to a draw. Strong Othello software has long been built using\nheuristically designed search techniques. Solving a game provides the solution\nwhich enables software to play the game perfectly.",
