The CVE database is critical for anyone doing vulnerability management or security research, and for a whole lot of other uses. There isn't really anyone else left who does this, and it's typically been work that is paid for and supported by the US government, which is a major consumer of this information, btw.\n\nI reached out to MITRE, and they confirmed it is for real. Here is the contract, which is through the Department of Homeland Security, and has been renewed annually on the 16th or 17th of April.\n\nhttps://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70RCSJ23FR0000015_7001_70RSAT20D00000001_7001\n\nMITRE's CVE database is likely going offline tomorrow. They have told me that for now, historical CVE records will be available at GitHub, https://github.com/CVEProject\n\nYosry Barsoum, vice president and director at MITRE's Center for Securing the Homeland, said:\n\n“On Wednesday, April 16, 2025, funding for MITRE to develop, operate, and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®) Program and related programs, such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™) Program, will expire.  The government continues to make considerable efforts to support MITRE’s role in the program and MITRE remains committed to CVE as a global resource.”",

His professional journey includes roles as Principal Software Architect at PKWARE, Senior Backend Engineer at Fetch Rewards, and Staff Software Engineer at Bold Penguin, where he consistently designed high-performance, scalable systems.\n\nDave's current passion project, Contextium, represents the culmination of his technical expertise and intellectual interests. This system transforms natural language into deep semantic graphs -- and vice versa -- through innovative knowledge representation techniques. Contextium employs a symbolic, rules-based approach to NLP rather than relying solely on statistical methods, allowing for precise semantic understanding and addressing critical limitations in current AI systems, for example hallucinations in large language models.\n\nA published author with O'Reilly Media, Dave wrote 'Programming Visual Basic .NET' (2001) and 'CDO & MAPI Programming with Visual Basic' (2000), demonstrating his ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly.\nOver his long career, Dave has worked in many languages and tech stacks. His interests extend beyond pure engineering to theoretical aspects of AI, consciousness, and the intersection of symbolic and neural approaches to machine intelligence.\n\nYou can follow Dave on Social Media\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/davegrundgeiger/\n\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO THE PODCAST\n\n- Spotify: http://isaacl.dev/podcast-spotify\n- Apple Podcasts: http://isaacl.dev/podcast-apple\n- Google Podcasts: http://isaacl.dev/podcast-google\n- RSS: http://isaacl.dev/podcast-rss\n\nYou can check out more episodes of Coffee and Open Source on https://www.coffeeandopensource.com\n\nCoffee and Open Source is hosted by Isaac Levin (https://twitter.com/isaacrlevin)",
