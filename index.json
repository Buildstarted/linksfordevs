As I frantically typed that article while replying to angry tweets, the thought came to mind: software engineering as a whole is hyper-focused on lowering the costs to write new code, yet there is a disregard for the costs that these improvements bring to other disciplines in a company on even to end users.\nSo, in this series finale, I want to compare how some choices that apparently lower development costs actually increase costs elsewhere. I also want to highlight how, if we made different decisions during development, we could possibly expose those extra costs early on. This is beneficial because exposing costs upfront allows us to make tough choices when there is still a chance of changing course.\nTo make things specific, I will look at how the use of modern frameworks that facilitate development can end up hurting performance, reliability, and usability. So let&rsquo;s start with a three-part rant first (sorry) and then let&rsquo;s look at what we might do.\n",
