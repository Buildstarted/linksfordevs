Presumably those taste buds were there the whole time. And yet, before I knew of the word umami I would kinda just round to the nearest concept, approximately ‚Äúsaltiness‚Äù or ‚Äúsavoriness‚Äù, and my understanding is that others do the same.\nBut that‚Äôs less than ideal.\n\n            Fish are very umami and salty, but a food doesn't have to be both\n        \n",

    "Description": "At work, I was given a task of joining two different events coming in via a real time stream in Apache Beam. While joins are simple in a SQL batch job, they are significantly more challenging in real time streaming sytems. In a batch job, the data is bounded - it is finite and eventually will be exhausted. In a real time streaming sytem, the data is potentially infinite - it must be broken up into a bounded set of records or your join will take an infinite amount of time. In addition, data comes in at different times - how long should you wait to decide the other side of the join is never coming? One solution to these problems is windowing. Windowing is breaking a real time event stream into bounded pieces. One example of windowing is a fixed window.",
