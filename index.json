The decision comes a day after former officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty  of murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death last May, setting off a wave of relief   across the country. The death prompted months of mass protests against policing  and the treatment of Black people in the U.S.  The Justice Department was already investigating whether Chauvin and the other officers involved in Floyd's death violated his civil rights.

    "Description": "Preface Below I wanted to reflect on the past year and solidify some ideas I’ve been having on mental/physical health. I also wanted to start discussing a project I’m interested in sharing in a development blog sort of fashion. Reflection My last real article was at the beginning of the novel corona virus outbreak. Between then and now the world and I have changed. In reflection on working from home and living during quarantine I’ve come to realize some truths about myself: Intense daily repetition and social isolation causes intrusive thoughts and eventually self destructive behavior To be truly independent we need to ask for help. During the past fall and early winter I’ve gone through periods of intense isolation and repetition. Specifically I went months without really leaving my home except for food, and each day was spent doing the same routine of rolling out of bed getting on a computer, working, eating, and then sleeping. With some breaks to watch TV/slack-off, or as my parents would call it when I was growing up, “Vegetate.” This cycle quickly caused me to have depressive behaviors. With nothing to break up the day, all of my daily actions would give me anxiety and I began to stress out over the smallest topics/details. Getting up and doing the same action each day became harder. What finally broke my depressive cycle was varied social interaction, which oddly enough I wanted to avoid at all costs. Specifically I began speaking about my problems to those who I loved. Just talking about my issues and feeling truly vulnerable enabled me to brake me out of my rut. I know talking about personal issues and problems isn’t rocket surgery. However, for me it’s been a new skill to learn. While growing up, I had an idea about what it really meant to be an “adult.” I needed to be strong, independent, tenacious, and intelligent. While great traits to have they really miss the point. Being an adult is best when sharing life with others, and insurmountable difficulties are inevitable. I now understand becoming more mature is more like finding my childhood. Empathy, humility, kindness, and thoughtfulness are some of the first lessons I had during pre-school. I think I somehow lost them along the way, and in relearning I found out how to get back up. Future Projects Some background first, I’m a software engineer by passion and trade. I really enjoy authoring programs, and solving technical problems. I want to try and let others into this world regardless of skill level to see what the process is actually like. I’ve recently started a new job at a fantastic company, Marklogic. Without getting into too much detail my current team has been using the Python programming language. In my past work I hadn’t really had to interact with Python in any professional capacity. I’ve done some small projects and I have a passing understanding of it, however I never really had to work with it deeply. In a few coming articles I will explore an example project of creating a webcrawler from scratch."

    "Description": "Credit: Sarah Marshall/CC BY 2.0 A government minister has encouraged citizens concerned about the recent leak of personal data gained in a major breach of Facebook to visit the Have I Been Pwned? website to check whether they have been affected. Data from a reported 533 million users was gained from the social network up to 2019 via data scraping – an automated process through which information is extracted from websites and typically imported into local files, such as spreadsheets. This data, understood to largely comprise phone numbers, was recently published online. About 11 million UK Facebook account holders are understood to have been affected. Minister for media and data John Whittingdale indicated that the government’s advice for those who are concerned that their information may have been leaked is to visit HIBP – a website set up to allow people to check if and when their personal data has been compromised in a data breach. Visitors to the site can enter their email address and phone number and see all the breaches in which these details have been posed.

This website has been supported by the National Cyber Security Centre in the past.” The Facebook breach is now the subject of an inquiry by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, which last week announced the launch of an official probe. “The DPC, having considered the information provided by Facebook Ireland regarding this matter to date, is of the opinion that one or more provisions of the GDPR and/or the Data Protection Act 2018 may have been, and/or are being, infringed in relation to Facebook Users’ personal data,” it said. The data minister, who was speaking in answer to a written parliamentary question from shadow digital minister Chi Onwurah, said that UK regulators will assist with the probe. “The Information Commissioner’s Office continues to work with and support its Irish counterpart to ensure that the data of UK citizens is protected,” he said. “The government has made it clear that all organisations, especially large global tech firms who process vast amounts of personal data, must comply with the UK’s data protection legislation, which poses strict obligations on organisations to ensure that UK citizens’ data is processed safely, securely and transparently. Organisations which fail to comply with the legislation may be investigated by the Information Commissioner’s Office and subject to increased fines.”"
