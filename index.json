As far as I can tell only code mere mortals can use in a general way is to route over it is to use socat vsock support\n.\nSeems that libkrun implements a slirp-style network forwarded on kvm host side and I have no clue what they do inside kvm. If you figure that out, ping me on my socials.\nUpdate: More info in twitter discussion\n.\nEmbedding JITTED WASM in libkrun\nHN completely ignored the story\n on how to marry above with WASM.\nWhy?\n\nBut there’s an scenario where Virtualization is not optional, and that’s when you want to protect the workload with Confidential Computing technologies such as SEV or TDX, as both of them are built on top of the existing Virtualization capabilities provided by the hardware.\n\nMetallize\nI once wrote a tool to make it easy to generate machine images using docker. I posted a re-implementation of that here: https://github.com/tarasglek/metallize\n\nI need to make a really high performance networking setup to drive multiple 100G nics at max perf which required network namespaces, carefully setup subnets, cpu pinning, a custom fio, etc. Docker was the quickest way to iterate on those.\nApparently there is a way to do something similar using podman/buildah.\nConclusion\nThis set of technologies clicked together in my head from that random github recommendation.

To achieve this, developers often embrace design principles that steer them in writing this type of high-quality code. One such set of principles is known as SOLID, an acronym representing five essential tenets in object-oriented programming.",

    "Description": "\n\n\nIn the fast-paced world of software engineering, an industry characterized by an average tenure between 1-2 years1, the notion of seniority has always been somewhat fluid. It is an environment where you’re expected to go from “new grad” to “senior” within 36 months, which presents a pace much faster than in most other professions. And yet, this swift movement through ranks, this very structure of seniority, faces disruption at the hands of emerging technologies, namely Language Learning Models (LLMs) like Copilot and ChatGPT.\nThe Changing Dynamics of Workflow\nTo understand the seismic shift that’s underway, you only have to ask the seasoned engineers in your team: has Copilot or ChatGPT had an impact on your workflow? Anecdotal evidence2 will tell you that in a vast majority of cases, these tools have indeed been revolutionary, despite the shaky early criticisms of Copilot. LLMs have the potential to churn out low-level code, provide debugging insights, and even advise on high-level architecture, amplifying productivity in an unprecedented way.\nThe immediate repercussion, however, is a trend toward hiring fewer interns and junior engineers. In a world where an LLM can augment the efforts of a mid-level or senior engineer so effectively, the traditional utility of the junior engineer  as a “code monkey” diminishes. The landscape becomes further treacherous for aspiring engineers, considering the spate of recent layoffs in tech companies.3 4 5",
