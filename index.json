I asked why she thought that was happening, and she said, ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù.

At the same time, the chasm\nbetween our understanding of these systems and our ability to use them\nseemed to widen even further. It turns out that even our most basic\nassumptions of how these systems can be trained are incomplete at best.\nFor instance, under the supervision of Tom\nGoldstein, researchers showed that novel\ndiffusion models are not‚Äîcontrary to the previous consensus‚Äîoverly\nreliant on Gaussian noise, and in fact, other sources of noise are\nequally valid.1",
