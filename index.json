The frog hesitates, afraid that the scorpion might start running Scrum, but the scorpion promises not to, pointing out that they would both be out of work if they interfered with the frog's programming. The frog considers this argument sensible and agrees to work for the scorpion. Midway through the project, the scorpion demands the frog write Confluence pages, drowning them both in paperwork. The dying frog asks the scorpion why it did this despite knowing the consequence, to which the scorpion replies: \"I am sorry, but I couldn't resist the urge. It's my character.\"",
