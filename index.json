Firstly must have been my exposure to Elixir in 2022, which introduced me to the idea of debugging live systems and \"staying in your program\". Secondly must have been my chief complaint of Rust; although it is a wonderful language and ecosystem in many ways, you can't say that it's beautiful, which my previous love Haskell very much was. Thirdly then must been the talk Stop Writing Dead Programs by Jack Rusher, which opened my eyes to the prevalence of the write-compile-run development cycle and how we can escape from it. And last was my day-to-day usage of Emacs, whose configuration language is also a Lisp. Thanks Henrik.",
