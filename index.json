Depending on your perspective, I-bonds are either free money or the only true money storage. They're zero-risk bonds with an interest rate that always matches or exceeds inflation. The interest rate trails inflation a bit and changes at 6 month intervals, so the math works out such that if you buy before May this year, you get a guaranteed ~8.5% return over the next 12 months, but if you miss this month you might get screwed. After a year you're allowed to withdraw, with almost negligible penalties. But the government only lets each person buy $10,000 of I-bonds a year. Still, that's a free $850.",
