It’s interesting because it runs its own index, only indexes Australian websites, is written by an Australian for Australians and hosted in Australia. It’s interesting technically because it runs almost entirely serverless using AWS Lambda, and uses bit slice signatures or bloom filters for the index similar to Bing. I also found out the most successful code I have ever written is PHP, despite never being a professional PHP developer.",

Attackers and defenders increasingly understand that build pipelines are highly-privileged targets with a substantial attack surface. But what are the potential weak points in a CI/CD pipeline? What does this type of attack look like in practice? NCC Group has found many attack paths through different security assessments that could have led to a compromised CI/CD pipeline in enterprises large and small. In this post, we will share some of our war stories about what we have observed and been able to demonstrate on CI/CD pipeline security assessments, clearly showing why there is the saying, “they are execution engines\"",
