Opinions are generally split between e4 being better for learning, no difference, and rarely that d4 is better. Typical reasoning being that e4 leads to sharper games and gives you more opportunities to learn. The other starting moves as white are rarely recommended for beginners altogether and rarely played at all levels. Another common question is whether playing shorter or longer games helps you improve faster, with the orthodoxy being that longer games help you learn more overall. The standard argument Iâ€™ve seen is that you have more time to analyze things in longer games which helps in all modes while the skills you improve in quicker games are less applicable in the longer time controls. Iâ€™ve downloaded games from Lichessâ€™ database to explore those questions.",
