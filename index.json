As the ‚Äúbitter lesson‚Äù in AI suggests, what often matters most is scaling what works. The simple insight here is that deep learning - combined with aligned scaling - tends to outperform more delicate approaches.

    "Description": "RJJ Software's Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software's Podcasting Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.\r\n\r\n Show Notes \"So we're dealing with code bases that are getting bigger and bigger every day. You know, those million line code bases, two million line code bases is not unusual. We are being pushed to do more. I remember when I was working at Microsoft a couple of years ago, Satya Nadella, CEO, his favourite phrase was, \"you have to do more with less.\" But yeah, so Satya was big on this idea of do more with less. And this has kind of resonated across the industry as a whole.\"‚Äî Jim Bennett\r\n\r\n Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am not your host: Jamie. I'm Delilah and I will be recording the intro for this episode because Jamie is suffering with a throat infection.\r\n\r\n In this episode, Jim Bennett returns to the show after a six-year absence. In his previous appearance, Jim introduced us to Xamarin, but in the time since that appearance, Xamarin has been sunsetted. So it felt natural to start our conversation about the wonderful outpouring of support over on X with the hashtag #XamarinGaveMe.\r\n\r\n The main topic of conversation is about Generative AI, Large Language Models, and how the new startup, Pieces, can help developers to keep the context of what they are working on at the front of their mind at all times; both when they are online and off.\r\n\r\n \"If I said to you, \"which character from the Pixar movie Up are you?\" The answer is going to be, \"Doug,\" we're all Doug. We're all like, \"squirrel!\"\r\n\r\n So if we have to go from our IDE to a browser to ask a question, we're reading email on the way. We are looking at chat tools on the way. Oh, we're in a browser. \"Oh, I've got a notification on Blue Sky. I'm going to have a look at that.\" We are context switching. We are distracted. We are drinking coffee. We are losing our productivity\"‚Äî Jim Bennett\r\n\r\n Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.\r\n\r\n My voice was created using Generative AI.\r\n\r\n Supporting the Show If you find this episode useful in any way, please consider supporting the show by either leaving a review (check our review page for ways to do that), sharing the episode with a friend or colleague, buying the host a coffee, or considering becoming a Patron of the show.\r\n\r\n Full Show Notes The full show notes, including links to some of the things we discussed and a full transcription of this episode, can be found at:  https://dotnetcore.show/season-7/unlocking-the-power-of-ai-jim-bennett-on-pieces-for-developers\r\n\r\n Jim's Links:  Jim's linked on Link Tree  Pieces  Pieces Discord #XamarinGaveMe Xamarin in Action (AKA Jim's book on Xamarin)  Jamie's Public NuGet Packages:  OwaspHeaders.Core ClackMiddleware OnionArch.Mvc  Useful Links   Generative AI for .NET Developers with Amit Bahree Ollama OpenVino  LLMs Mentioned:  Llama Microsoft Phi Mistral Qwen-2.5 which Jamie mis-names as Quon.
