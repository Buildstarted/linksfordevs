This interpretation is completely and categorically wrong.\nOriginal Quote It’s very common for statements to lose their original meaning when context has been stripped and that’s exactly what happened here.",

It performs a quick, shallow check, and does not verify that\nall the data is intact. I also restore a random file, whenever I run restic check, to test recoverability.\nShortly after I wrote the previous post, I decided to run restic check --read-data for the first time ever. This reads every file in the repository\nand simulates a full restore. To my utter horror, it reported many errors like\nthese!\nPack ID does not match, want 5e66c2ac, got e80051de\npack d64be86d contains 1 errors: [Blob ID does not match, want 8ebf2c10, got 350f6ba1]",
