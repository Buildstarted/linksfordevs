A distinct\nproduction version of Codex powers GitHub Copilot. On HumanEval, a new\nevaluation set we release to measure functional correctness for synthesizing\nprograms from docstrings, our model solves 28.8% of the problems, while GPT-3\nsolves 0% and GPT-J solves 11.4%. Furthermore, we find that repeated sampling\nfrom the model is a surprisingly effective strategy for producing working\nsolutions to difficult prompts. Using this method, we solve 70.2% of our\nproblems with 100 samples per problem. Careful investigation of our model\nreveals its limitations, including difficulty with docstrings describing long\nchains of operations and with binding operations to variables. Finally, we\ndiscuss the potential broader impacts of deploying powerful code generation\ntechnologies, covering safety, security, and economics."
