    "Description": "\nOver the last couple of years, I’ve helped dozens of users and organizations to build Change Data Capture (CDC) pipelines for their Postgres databases. A key concern in that process is setting up and managing replication slots, which are Postgres' mechanism for making sure that any segments of the write-ahead log (WAL) of the database are kept around until they have been processed by registered replication consumers.\n\n\nWhen not being careful, a replication slot may cause unduly large amounts of WAL segments to be retained by the database. This post describes best practices helping to prevent this and other issues, discussing aspects like heartbeats, replication slot failover, monitoring, the management of Postgres publications, and more. While this is primarily based on my experience of using replication slots via Debezium’s Postgres connector, the principles are generally applicable and are worth considering also when using other CDC tools for Postgres based on logical replication.\n",

Ever since I started working at Dylibso, I have been contributing to the project.\nExtism is Dylibso’s family of open-source projects to develop and host WebAssembly (Wasm) plugins. Going forward, we believe the Chicory SDK is a solid foundation for running Wasm modules in Java applications, making it our default Wasm runtime for Extism on the Java platform. We’re putting our money where our mouth is: the mcpx4j library for running mcp.run servlets is built on top of the Chicory SDK.",
