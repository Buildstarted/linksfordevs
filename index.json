    "Description": "In this paper we provide evidence of an emerging criminal infrastructure\nenabling impersonation attacks at scale. Impersonation-as-a-Service (ImpaaS)\nallows attackers to systematically collect and enforce user profiles\n(consisting of user credentials, cookies, device and behavioural fingerprints,\nand other metadata) to circumvent risk-based authentication system and\neffectively bypass multi-factor authentication mechanisms. We present the\nImpaaS model and evaluate its implementation by analysing the operation of a\nlarge, invite-only, Russian ImpaaS platform providing user profiles for more\nthan $260'000$ Internet users worldwide. Our findings suggest that the ImpaaS\nmodel is growing, and provides the mechanisms needed to systematically evade\nauthentication controls across multiple platforms, while providing attackers\nwith a reliable, up-to-date, and semi-automated environment enabling target\nselection and user impersonation against Internet users as scale.",
