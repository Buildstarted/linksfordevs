Teaching to think is just as important as teaching to code, but this is seldom done; I think something I’ve done last month is a great opportunity to draw the curtain a bit.\nserde is the Rust framework for serialization and deserialization. Everyone uses it, and it’s the default among the ecosystem. serde_json is the official serde “mixin” for JSON, so when people need to parse stuff, that’s what they use instinctively. There are other libraries for JSON parsing, like simd-json, but serde_json is overwhelmingly used: it has 26916 dependents at the time of this post, compared to only 66 for simd-json.\nThis makes serde_json a good target (not in a Jia Tan way) for optimization. Chances are, many of those 26916 users would profit from switching to simd-json, but as long as they aren’t doing that, smaller optimizations are better than nothing, and such improvements are reapt across the ecosystem.",
