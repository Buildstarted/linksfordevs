In the past we've discussed an attack against rolling code security systems called RollJam, which works by jamming the original keyfob signal so the vehicle cannot receive it, and at the same time recording it for later use.

    "Description": "My calendar is full of meetings and for various reasons, I find it difficult to skip them. Some of those meetings help me build context (or keep it up to date) around an area that I care about. Others are there to build and maintain relationships. As a remote worker, I no longer have a space to talk to peers on the way to lunch or while grabbing coffee, so 1:1s fill that purpose too. With the amount of meetings in my calendar, I don’t have clarity about which meetings actually need my real-time presence. This is particularly troublesome when there are conflicts and I need to pick 1 of 2 (or sometimes 3) meetings to attend. I need a system to decide: Is this important? Do I need to be there in real time? Can I just read the notes afterward? Every meeting invite looks the same in my calendar. A 30-minute block with a vague title and a list of attendees. No indication of whether I’m there to make decisions, provide context, or just stay informed. This forces me to make attendance decisions with incomplete information. I end up in meetings where I contribute nothing, while missing others where my input was actually needed. I’ve been thinking about this for a few months now and finally wrote down some notes on what I would like to see in every calendar entry. I came up with a template and the first iteration is this: # Daniel's Experimental Meeting Template ## Meeting Notes *Specify the location of the meeting notes. It may be an attached document, a wiki page, a tab in a document or a shared folder.* ## Attendees *Who will find value from attending this meeting? It could be a project manager, designer, stakeholders for a project, your team or engineers working on a specific platform.* ## Pre-work *What should attendees prepare before the meeting? Should they come with a list of questions? Or read a document?* ## Type of Meeting *What is the primary purpose for this meeting? This helps set expectations for participants.* - [ ] Fact-finding - Gathering information, understanding current state, identifying unknowns - [ ] Decision-making - Making choices with clear authority and accountability - [ ] Consensus-building - Aligning on approach through discussion and agreement - [ ] Context sharing - Providing updates, knowledge transfer, or background information - [ ] Status update - Reporting progress, blockers, and next steps - [ ] Dry run - Practice or preparation for upcoming meeting or presentation - [ ] 1:1 - One-on-one discussion (career development, feedback, relationship building) - [ ] Other: ________________ ## Agenda *Create a time-boxed agenda to keep the meeting focused. If the meeting is at risk of going over the allotted time, schedule a separate meeting or resolve the remaining issues offline.* Example: - 2-5 minutes: Review action items from the previous meeting - 5-15 minutes: Discussion on [main topic] - 5 minutes: Pulse check on [specific area - project health, blockers, team sentiment] ## Purpose *Write one to three sentences describing what this meeting is intended to accomplish. Include what is NOT in scope to prevent scope creep.* Example: The meeting is intended to discuss the development status and challenges of [project]. This is not a meeting to explore or make decisions on other projects. ## Exit Criteria *When should this recurring meeting end or evolve?* Example: This meeting will stop once Project ABC is either shipped or rolled back. ## Related Meetings *List other meetings where this topic might come up. This may be a platform sync, team meeting, or org-wide meeting.*",
