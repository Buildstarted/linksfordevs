An elderly fellow with a long career in finance, every morning he would plop into his Aeron and spend the day making calls to his buddies, probably to invite them to give talks or join new financial initiatives. He had severe losses in his hearing, which he had transformed into impressive gains in speaking loudness. All the sound waves that missed his speakerphone simply spilled to the rest of the office. The students nearby got a kick from overhearing his conversations because of his no-shits-given attitude and dark humor. He would tell his friends: I have 3 children, each of them flawed in their own ways, but they have given me 6 grandchildren, each of them perfect -- grandchildren are God's way of telling you to not kill your children!",
