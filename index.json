The attack was discovered due to expiration of one of the MiTM certificates, which haven’t been reissued.\nThere are no indications of the server breach or spoofing attacks on the network segment, quite the contrary: the traffic redirection has been configured on the hosting provider network.\nThe wiretapping may have lasted for up to 6 months overall (90 days confirmed).
