We will learn the math behind it so you can implement it in your future projects with ease. I will try to make it as comprehensible as possible, explain all the caveats and issues you may stumble upon. We will also talk about optimization and how can spatial hash maps significantly help you. I will also provide some basic live examples for you to try out. Please note that demos were written to be as simple as possible, do not expect enterprise-grade code - we only learn about the concept, not the implementation."
