    "Description": "The Dolphin Blog is full of stories surrounding games, their development, and the challenges they present to emulate them. And in these stories, we sometimes have some recurring characters that we gain a better understanding of over time. Factor 5 and their Star Wars: Rogue Squadron games continue to amaze us time and time again as we find different ways that they push the hardware to its limits. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker uses many graphical tricks to create a timeless style, that surprise again in again with just how much care was put into every detail. And, of course the Metroid Prime series shows up often given its sensitivity to even subtle changes to emulation.\nHowever, as with every story, there have to be villains as well. One such villain is the The Disney Trio of Destruction™. For years, users have awaited the final showdown with these games. And guess what? They're finally playable right now. But are these games truly villains? Or were they just misunderstood? In this report, we dive into The Disney Trio of Destruction™ once and for all to determine their true nature.\nNot every returning character is a game. Sometimes we also have to deal with our own issues, such as Dual Core mode. It is constantly breaking games, disabled in many popular games by default, and the source of most crashes in Dolphin. But is Dual Core really a hack? Or is Dolphin simply doing something wrong. In this report, we'll dive into the history of Dual Core and make a change that was long overdue.\nOn top of all of this, several longstanding features in Dolphin also saw some major upgrades, and we'll also get to those throughout the Dolphin Progress Report. With that, let us begin.",

Please\ndon’t be one of the 34 people that replied to tell me Linux is not ready.\nAndroid has always been a fairly open platform, especially if you were\ndeliberate about getting it that way, but we’ve seen in recent months an\nextremely rapid devolution of the Android ecosystem: 1. The closing of\ndevelopment of an increasing number of components in AOSP.\n[https://9to5google.com/2025/03/26/google-android-aosp-developement-private/] 2.\nSamsung [https://trendslife.in/samsung-one-ui-removed-bootloader-unlock/],\nXiaomi\n[https://droidwin.com/xiaomi-might-no-longer-allow-bootloader-unlocking-on-miui/]\nand OnePlus [https://droidwin.com/now-oneplus-restricts-bootloader-unlocking/]\nhave removed the option of bootloader unlocking on all of their devices. I\nsuspect Google is not far behind. 3. Google implementing Play Integrity API and\nencouraging developers to implement it. Notably the EU’s own identity\nverification wallet requires this, in stark contrast to their own laws and\npolicies, despite the protest of hundreds on Github. 4. And finally, the\nmandatory implementation of developer verification across Android systems. Yes,\nif you’re running a 3rd-party OS like GOS you won’t be directly affected by\nthis, but it will impact 99.9% of devices, and I foresee many open source\ndevelopers just opting out of developing apps for Android entirely as a result.\nWe’ve already seen SyncThing simply discontinue development\n[https://forum.syncthing.net/t/discontinuing-syncthing-android/23002] for this\nreason, citing issues with Google Play Store. They’ve also repeatedly denied\nupdates for NextCloud with no explanation, only restoring it after mass outcry.\nAnd we’ve already seen Google targeting any software intended to circumvent ads,\nlabeling them in the system as “dangerous” and “untrusted”. This will most\ncertainly carry into their new “verification” system. Google once competed with\nApple for customers. But in a world where Google walks away from the biggest\nantitrust trial since 1998 with yet another slap on the wrist, competition is\ndead, and Google is taking notes from Apple about what they can legally get away\nwith. Android as we know it is dead. And/or will be dead very soon. We need an\nopen replacement.",
