This showcase/telethon works to collect as many donations as possible during a week-long videogame speedrunning marathon. One segment that caught my eye was the Tool-Assisted Speedruns (TAS). These speedruns focus on “scripting” a series of button presses in an emulated environment (an emulator) to beat (and sometimes break) video games. A further extension of this subset of the speedrunning community involves replaying” pre-programmed scripts (thus the “tool” portion) on real hardware. I’ve been putting off reaching out to the community for a few years, but I finally decided to reach out this year. What follows are my observations, learnings, and other notes from working to improve TAS reliability on the N64 console."

    "Description": "Pine started out around 1989 as a project of the Office of Computing\nand Communications at the University\nof Washington. The idea was to provide an easy-to-use mail system for\nUNIX boxes. We examined a few of the alternatives and found Elm close to\nwhat we wanted but still lacking, most notably in the interface to the\nmessage editor. It usually defaulted to either vi or emacs, neither of\nwhich were suitable for our purposes so we choose to replace it with a\nhacked version of micro emacs. Elm also lacked an easy way to get a list\nof folders, an address book, and an integrated message viewer. The name\nPine was the obvious choice, being a tree like Elm, being prominent in\nthe Pacific NorthWet (yes NorthWet) and with many possible acronyms.\nThe first acronym choice was Pine Is Nearly Elm as that was the\ncase. It has never stood for Pine Is Not Elm as we were happy to\nhave elm as a starting point."
