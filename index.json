Now, let  be our trajectory, and  be the number of times that . Since\n\nthe question of whether the random walk we have described is recurrent comes down to whether the central binomial coefficient grows quickly enough to make this series diverge. Does it? We can also consider the random walk on , moving at each step by an increment in the set , in which case the expected number of visits to the origin is\n\nWhen are these processes recurrent?
