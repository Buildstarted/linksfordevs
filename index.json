    "Description": "The Turing test is dead, and we killed it. The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. From the 1940s  to the 2010s people programmed computers, and computers could only do what they were programmed to do in a rules-based deterministic manner. Sometimes a person would program the computer and it would do something unexpected, but 100 out of 100 times the computer was doing what it was programmed to do whether the person liked it or not. While there has been experimentation with what today we call AI since the 1950s, those machines were a long ways away from passing the Turing test. Why does using ChatGPT feel more like a conversation with the smartest person you know than a computer? It's because ChatGPT doesn't solve problems deterministically the way a programmed computer does, it solves them probabilistically.  ChatGPT demonstrates the ability to think about something in a logical, sensible way, the definition of reasoning.  We've created something completely new here, a reasoning computer.",
