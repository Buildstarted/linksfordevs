Be sure to turn into last week’s episode, “Aaron Stannard on the Actor Model with Akka.NET | Part 1” to learn all about Aaron’s career history and the creation of Akka.NET. &nbsp; Aaron is the founder and CEO of Petabridge and Sdkbin, building open source tools for .NET developers to build concurrent and distributed applications. He’s also the founder of MarkedUp Analytics, a real-time in-app marketing and analytics service used by 1000+ developers, and has spent some time inside Microsoft as a Startup Developer Evangelist. &nbsp; In this episode, Aaron discusses the general use cases of Akka.NET, the problem it addresses, where and how to use the actor model, and more. Don’t miss out on this deeply fascinating two-part series with Aaron Stannard! &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:36] About The Azure DevOps Podcast, Clear Measure; the new video podcast Architect Tips; and Jeffrey’s offer to speak at virtual user groups. [1:13] About today’s episode with Aaron Stannard. [1:53] For application types, if someone is building a web application, a native application, or a mobile app, would they put Akka.NET in a backend process that consumes messages being received from somewhere? [3:53] Is high-scale more so Akka.NET’s bread-and-butter as opposed to low-scale, but constantly running? [10:10] Is the transport always a queue like Azure Service Bus or is it ever a web service call? [13:32] Is Akka.NET used instead of or with other frameworks? [15:32] Aaron shares several use cases of Akka.NET and explains the problems that it can address. [22:02] A word from Azure DevOps Podcast’s sponsor: Clear Measure. [22:37] Why a developer might look at/use Akka.NET. Aaron also explains another area where actors are used. [26:56] The nuanced things you can do with Akka.NET that you can’t do with other built-in tools in platforms like Azure. [27:28] How close on the network do the servers need to be to participate? [27:53] Aaron explains how Akka.Cluster would work for a specific use case problem. [29:43] Where the actor model can help developers. [33:17] The overhead requirements for Akka.NET.
