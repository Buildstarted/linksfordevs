    "Description": "Native AOT has been part of .NET since .NET 7. With each release we're extending the areas where it can be used. From console apps in .NET 7, through ASP.NET web APIs in .NET 8, to MAUI in .NET 9. It is your best bet if you need your .NET app to start fast and use as little memory as possible.\n\nBut how does native AOT actually work? Why does it start so fast? How can we fit an entire .NET runtime, the base class libraries, and your code in a 1 MB executable file?\n\nIn this talk we'll peek into the internal workings of native AOT compilation and look at what it does at run time.\n\nFeaturing: Michal Strehovsk√Ω\n\nConnect with .NET: \nBlog:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog\nTwitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter\nTikTok:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok\nMastodon:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon\nLinkedIn:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin\nFacebook:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook\nDocs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet\nForums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums\nüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èQ&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa\nüë®‚ÄçüéìMicrosoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#dotnet #dotnetconf #dotnet9",

Today, we're putting YARP and Ocelot head-to-head to see how they stack up. I'll show you what makes each one special, where they shine, and yes - even where they struggle a bit. We'll look at real examples, talk about performance (with some surprising findings!), and break down when you might want to use one over the other. No fancy jargon or marketing speak - just practical insights to help you pick the right tool for your project. Whether you're just getting started with API gateways or thinking about switching between these two, this video will help clear things up.
