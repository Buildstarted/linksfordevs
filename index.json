    "Description": "As movement toward memory-safe languages, and Rust in particular, continues to\ngrow, it is worth looking at\none of the larger scale efforts to port C code that has existed for decades\nto Rust. The uutils project aims to\nrewrite all of the individual utilities included in the GNU Coreutils project in\nRust. Originally created by Jordi\nBoggiano in 2013, the project aims to provide drop-in\nreplacements for the Coreutils programs, adding\nthe data-race protection and memory safety that Rust provides."
