    "Description": "If you‚Äôve been around electronics for a while, you‚Äôve probably noticed that components like resistors, capacitors, zener diodes, and inductors come in some odd values. Looking at the chart below, there seems to be no clear rationale¬†behind the values, but there is a pattern. 47kŒ© resistors and 22ŒºF capacitors are everywhere, but not 40kŒ© or 50kŒ© resistors, or 20ŒºF or 30ŒºF capacitors. So what‚Äôs the deal? It all has to do with preferred numbers.",
