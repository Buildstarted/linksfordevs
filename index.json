    "Description": "On January 15th, 1990, a single line of code triggered a cascading failure that crippled AT&T's long-distance network for nearly 9 hours, leaving millions of Americans unable to make calls. In today's episode of Dave’s Garage, we dive into the software bug that caused one of the largest telecommunications outages in history.\n\nWith AT&T controlling 70% of long-distance traffic, the outage impacted 50 million calls and cost the company $60 million in lost revenue. At the heart of the problem was a subtle race condition in the code running the SS7 signaling system—an error that passed unnoticed through code reviews and testing until the perfect storm of conditions exposed it.\n\nWe’ll walk through the technical details of the bug, how it spread through AT&T’s 114 switches, and the larger lessons it taught the telecom industry about software complexity and testing.  Thanks to David Sobeski for the episode idea!\n\nFree Sample of my Book on the Spectrum: https://amzn.to/3zBinWM\n\nDave's Attic - Friday 4PM Podcast - https://www.youtube.com/@UCtb6a_CnmGbSns9G8W2Ny0w \n\nFollow me for updates!  \nTwitter:   @davepl1968 davepl1968\nFacebook: fb.com/davepl",

You see for Postgres itself stability and reliability is core. So where does the new stuff come from if it’s not in the stable core… extensions.\nExtensions within Postgres are unlike most other databases allowing you to modify or well extend the standard Postgres behavior. You can build other storage backends, new types, etc. Postgres itself ships with a number of extensions within the “contrib”. The list of contrib extensions hasn’t changed any time recently, but even contrib is a small sampling of what is possible. Beyond core there is a whole world of extensions, I want dig into just a smalls sampling starting with a few in core…",

Mullenweg then responded but deleted the post. Mullenweg put a new post up at the same URL which offered a modicum of contrition, but was still doubling down on his actions.
