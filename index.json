On the contrary, a typical application will talk to several external systems like databases, messaging systems, cache providers, and many 3rd party services. And it's up to you to ensure everything functions correctly.\nHopefully, I don't have to convince you about the value of writing tests.\nYou should be writing tests. Period.\nHowever, I do want to discuss the value of integration testing.\nUnit tests are helpful to test business logic in isolation, without any external services. They are easy to write and provide almost instant feedback.\nBut you can't be fully confident in your application without integration tests.\nSo, in this week's newsletter, I'll show you how to use Docker for integration testing.\nHere's what we will use to write integration tests:\n- Testcontainers - Docker - xUnit\nLet's dive in!",
