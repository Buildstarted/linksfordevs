It's a pretty basic app; it has a 25 minute timer (that runs in a Web Worker) and saves a history of your \"poms\" to a small Firebase database. I initially built it using React (well, Preact actually) but I then started to play around with Svelte, and decided rebuilding the app in Svelte might be a nice way to blog about the similarities and differences between the libraries."

But one particular piece of advice keeps coming up, and it’s dangerous enough to merit its own article. In a whole bunch of places you will be told not to install security updates when building your Docker image. This advice is given by the official Docker docs’ best practices page: Avoid RUN apt-get upgrade and dist-upgrade, as many of the “essential” packages from the parent images cannot upgrade inside an unprivileged container. To be clear: RUN commands happen during image build, not during container startup. The documentation there is saying “build your images without installing security updates”. You’ll see the same advice in the hadolint Dockerfile linter (it cites the above), and you’ll even see it in the OWASP Docker cheatsheet: Avoid the use of apt/apk upgrade For the vast majority of people creating Dockerfiles this is absolutely awful advice. And since this bad advice is so common, let’s consider some of the justifications and why they are wrong."

At the time, I thought this was just a Safari bug. I brought the issue to the attention of some Safari engineers, who I had hoped would look into it. Since then, Safari has seen several software updates, and recently I remembered to check again to see whether the issue was resolved. Unfortunately I could still reproduce it, so I decided to investigate further. To my horror, I discovered that Chrome and Firefox were doing it too. That's too much a coincidence to be a bug, right? Could it be that web browsers are keeping open connections after windows are closed on purpose? If you don't have Little Snitch installed on the Mac (you should!), you can still see the open (ESTABLISHED) connections using the lsof (list open files) command-line tool in Terminal:"
