In this article, we will focus on techniques for truncating and wrapping text using the LineBreakMode property to enhance the readability of our text. Let's get started! üöÄ\n\nLet‚Äôs start!\nWhat is the LineBreakMode?\nThis property allows you to control the wrapping and truncation of the text. Accepts an enumeration as a value, which contains the following values:\n‚ûñ NoWrap\nIts responsibility is to display only the text that fits on the device‚Äôs first line. This means the amount of text visible on the first line may vary depending on the size device. ‚Äì [It‚Äôs the default value].\n\n\n\n‚ûñ WordWrap\nThese values automatically move text to the next line at the word boundary. This prevents words from being cut off at the end of a line, enhancing readability and allowing text to adapt to various screen sizes.\n\n\n\n‚ûñ CharacterWrap\nUnlike the WordWrap function, this setting automatically transfers text to the next line based on a character limit. This sometimes results in line breaks that do not align with entire words.\n\n\n\n\n‚ûñ HeadTruncation\nIt omits the beginning of the text, presenting only the final part in a single line. It‚Äôs best used when the text‚Äôs conclusion is most relevant to the reader, ensuring focus on the most pertinent information.\n\n\n\n\n‚ûñ MiddleTruncation\nUnify the beginning and end of the text to fit within a single line, replacing the middle section with an ellipsis, which consists of three dots (...)\n\n\n\n‚ûñ TailTruncation\n\n\nIt omits the end of the text, presenting only the initial part on a single line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd our article is completed! ¬†.\nThanks for ready! üëã See you next time! üíöüíï\nSpanish post:\n\n\n\n‚ûñ https://es.askxammy.com/truncamiento-y-ajuste-de-texto-en-net-maui/\nReference:\n‚ûñ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/label?view=net-maui-8.0?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-50033\n",
