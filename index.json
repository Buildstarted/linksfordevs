    "Description": "Daniel Roth is a program manager on the ASP.NET team working on ASP.NET Core, Blazor, and other web features. He has previously worked on various parts of .NET, including System.Net, WCF, XAML, and ASP.NET. And his passions include building frameworks for modern Web frameworks that are simple and easy to use. &nbsp; Daniel was last on the podcast over two years ago in episode 47 to discuss Blazor DevOps. In this episode, he and Jeffrey discuss web development with .NET 6.0. He shares the high points of what’s coming next for .NET 6.0, the major differences between .NET 5.0 and 6.0, what to look forward to with regards to Blazor, and his insights on WASM tooling, minimal APIs and hosting, and hot reload within .NET 6.0. &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:39] About The Azure DevOps Podcast, Clear Measure, and Jeffrey’s offer to speak at virtual user groups. [1:22] Jeffrey is looking to hire an apprentice! If you, or anyone you know, loves to code and wants to pursue software engineering, apply today! [2:03] Be sure to check out the new video podcast, Architect Tips. [2:08] About today’s episode with Daniel Roth. [2:20] Jeffrey welcomes Daniel to the podcast. [3:11] Is .NET 6 officially being released at the upcoming .NET Conf? And will Daniel be participating in the .NET Conf? [5:19] Daniel shares about his current focus on all-things Blazor and what he has been working on recently. [6:22] Is preview 7 of .NET 6.0 one of the final previews before the GA of .NET 6.0? Will there be more previews? [8:30] Is Blazor the new normal in terms of web applications, going forward? Daniel shares his predictions on what will be the standard .NET project type for the web. [13:23] Are blog sites not a great candidate for Blazor? [14:33] How Blazor should accrue value to your existing apps, not replace. [16:52] Pre-rendering web apps with Blazor WebAssembly. [19:11] How streamlined and seamless is the WebAssembly experience going to be in .NET 6.0? [24:45] The WebAssembly debugging experience for .NET 6.0. [27:37] A word from The Azure DevOps Podcast’s sponsor: Clear Measure. [28:11] Daniel elaborates on how they are adding support in .NET 6.0 to have small databases in WebAssembly on the client-side. [29:50] The strategy and thinking behind minimal APIs and making less code, and why it is important. [34:20] Daniel speaks about how they’re now leveraging the new file scope namespaces feature and getting started with ASP.NET 4.0. [39:38] Why minimal APIs allow for better performance. [40:01] Are there actually any practical frameworks out there that are benchmarked to be faster than ASP.NET? [42:08] How you can run at half the cost with twice the power just by redeploying your app in Azure. [42:50] What they are working towards with .NET 6.0 in terms of developer velocity and productivity.
