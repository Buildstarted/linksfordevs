It is not a reverse engineering of the API, since their implementation relies on radar forecasts for minutely results, as well as a few additional features. The API aims to return data using the same json structure as what Dark Sky uses, available here: https://web.archive.org/web/20200723173936/https://darksky.net/dev/docs. Feel free to register, subscribe to this API (navigate to APIs and click subscribe!), and let me know how it works at api@alexanderrey.ca.\nTo help support this project (my student AWS credits run out in June!), I've set up a donation link. There's also an option for a $2 monthly donation, which both supports this project and also raises monthly API limit to 50,000! If you need more than 5,000 calls per month, but less than that, then send a message to api@alexanderrey.ca and we can work something out."
