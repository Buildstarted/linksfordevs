Over the years, various modifications to the basic mini-batch gradient descent have been proposed, such as adding momentum or Nesterovâ€™s Accelerated Gradient (Sutskever et al., 2013), as well as the popular Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014). The paper Learning to Learn by Gradient Descent by Gradient Descent (Andrychowicz et al., 2016) demonstrates how the optimizer itself can be replaced with a simple neural network, which can be trained end-to-end. In this post, we will see how JAX, a relatively new Python library for numerical computing, can be used to implement a version of the optimizer introduced in the paper.",
