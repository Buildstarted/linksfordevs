    "Description": "(or, well, one of their delivery services.)\n\n🔊 Just a fair warning - there are some perhaps annoying glitch sounds in the attached recording. The volumes are normalized to limit loud spikes, as they were a lot worse in person. 😅\n\nso, my phone service has a rather clever anti-spam tactic, which works like this:\n\n * I receive a phone call from an unknown number, and it goes through screening when I answer it. It rings until the fifth ring, the voicemail greeting plays out, then I've got 30 seconds to judge if it's a spam robocall or if it's genuine\n * If it's okay, I press 1, and it interrupts the ring/voicemail sequence and I answer the call like usual.\n * If it's spam, I press ### (the # key by itself normally opens my PBX menu, so it doesn't go through) and hang up immediately.\n\nPressing ### and hanging up, will shove the call to voicemail, then launch a \"DTMF bomb\", which is a rapid sequence of over a hundred tones of DTMF keysmash, even including some of the \"ABCD\" keys. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling##,_*,_A,_B,_C,_and_D] This has blown up spammers' cheapass PBXes, especially ones with poor security and too much trust given to the DTMF decoder on the call server.\n\nSo, when IKEA called from a random 1-877 number to confirm my furniture shipment worth $1200 (that's the equivalent of :sixty: blåhaj!), the only thing it said is \"To continue in English, please press 1.\"... and I had no idea who it was, immediately thought it was spam, and did the ### gesture. Oops.\n\nWhat follows is a transcript of the call in the recording above.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n> \"To continue in English, please press 1️⃣.\"\n> [extremely rapid DTMF spam string]\n> \"Your delivery is scheduled for Tuesday.
