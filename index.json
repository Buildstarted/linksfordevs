Seeing how I‚Äôve built commercial software with Nim dynamic libraries, I thought I‚Äôd chime in with my knowledge. But since there are multiple threads out there and this is a large-ish topic I figured it would be better to do it as a post on here.",

I originally purchased the device to aid in my language learning studies and dabble in the world of ‚Äúhi-fi‚Äù audio. With both those phases of my life well in the past, the device seemed to make a perfect vulnerability research target. Coincidentally, I had also just watched through all of gamozolabs‚Äôs Android exploitation livestream, so I was feeling even more inspired to target an Android-based device.",
