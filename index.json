    "Description": "After reading various books, essays, and blog posts on what it takes to build a startup I've decided to create a step-by-step guide for it that is all-encompassing. Note that this content is heavily influenced by Lean Startup thinking and Running Lean by Ash Maurya, which in my opinion are the best books on succeeding with startup projects as a bootstrapper. A bootstrapper is someone who builds quickly themselves or with a small team and takes as little capital as they can in the early stages. I realize that there is some bias here as there are many other philosophies to building a startup in regards to investors, hard-tech, research projects, or geographical location. I believe that US-based tech founders who don't mind being technical, and funding their startup without taking too much initial capital will deeply resonate with this guide. For everyone else, I'm sure there is something for you here as well, though one or two of the steps may not apply to you or be relevant.",

Using this method will also allow you to effortlessly add a ‚Äúverbose‚Äù execution mode to scripts you create or extend. It also improves the usefulness of set -x aka xtrace mode. The method is compatible with zsh, and maybe also other advanced Bourne-style shells.",
