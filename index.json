I made an effort to switch to FOSS on android, but due to the fact that my phone's bootloader was locked, I couldn't install LineageOS. All this time I was aware that the core of my phone, it's kernel, was closed source and probably out-of-date. This nudged me to research Linux. The more I looked, the more there was to like. At first I tried installing Arch linux on WSL (Windows Subsystem For Linux) but this was unsuccessful. I wanted a truly native Linux device, but was unable to afford my own computer. This is where the Pinephone comes in, where I could kill two birds with one stone. Not only would I get a new phone of which I had complete control, but I'd also have a native Linux device. Now, I use my Pinephone as more than a phone. It's my communicator, my general purpouse computer and my development device. Calling it a phone just doesn't do this device justice. It's a desktop computer. One that happens to fit in your pocket. Keeping all this in mind, my usecase is relatively light. I need it for schoolwork, coding and testing programs, web browsing, communication, and video/audio streaming. The reason it can remain as my sole device is because I don't need to run heavy software like Autodesk. I need to do very basic tasks, and the Pinephone fulfills them and more.",
