    "Description": "Batch normalization is a key component of most image classification models,\nbut it has many undesirable properties stemming from its dependence on the\nbatch size and interactions between examples. Although recent work has\nsucceeded in training deep ResNets without normalization layers, these models\ndo not match the test accuracies of the best batch-normalized networks, and are\noften unstable for large learning rates or strong data augmentations. In this\nwork, we develop an adaptive gradient clipping technique which overcomes these\ninstabilities, and design a significantly improved class of Normalizer-Free\nResNets. Our smaller models match the test accuracy of an EfficientNet-B7 on\nImageNet while being up to 8.7x faster to train, and our largest models attain\na new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 86.5%. In addition, Normalizer-Free\nmodels attain significantly better performance than their batch-normalized\ncounterparts when finetuning on ImageNet after large-scale pre-training on a\ndataset of 300 million labeled images, with our best models obtaining an\naccuracy of 89.2%. Our code is available at https://github.com/deepmind/\ndeepmind-research/tree/master/nfnets"
