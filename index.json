    "Description": "As a geek, I love the idea of running LLMs locally, and owning my entire AI stack without depending on cloud APIs. I run LLMs locally with Ollama all the time. I’d love to see a world where the intelligence that these models provide is democratized, cheap and plentiful.\nBut if I think about it objectively there are several reasons local LLMs going mainstream might not happen.\nWidely used utilities want to be centralized\nIn the early days of electricity, factories generated their own electricity on-site. This phase was relatively short-lived, giving way to the centralized power grid we have now. The same thing happened with water, trash disposal, manufactured goods and pretty much every staple of modern life.",

Traditional compilers enabled programmers to express themselves in high-level languages instead of assembly. Similarly, LLMs empower programmers to express their intent directly in natural language, translating it into code.",
