But the reality is leadership is not a role or a title, it's action that you can take.\n\nLet's see how leadership can show up regardless of your level as I discuss which things I'd recommend focusing on.\n\nAs with all livestreams, I'm looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.\r\n\r\n----\r\nüîë Membership & Subscriptions:\n- üì® Weekly Newsletter: https://weekly.devleader.ca\n- üèòÔ∏è Private Discord Community: https://sidestack.io/devleader\n\nüß† Courses:\n- All Courses: https://www.devleader.ca/courses\n- Get Promoted As A Software Engineer: https://dometrain.com/course/career-getting-promoted-as-a-software-engineer/?ref=nick-cosentino\n- Nailing The Behavioral Interview: https://dometrain.com/course/career-nailing-the-behavioral-interview/?ref=nick-cosentino\n- Getting Started with C#: https://dometrain.com/course/getting-started-csharp?ref=nick-cosentino\n- Deep dive C#: https://dometrain.com/course/deep-dive-csharp?ref=nick-cosentino\n- C# Zero to Hero BUNDLE: https://dometrain.com/bundle/from-zero-to-hero-csharp/?ref=nick-cosentino\n- Reflection in .NET: https://dometrain.com/course/from-zero-to-hero-reflection-in-dotnet/?ref=nick-cosentino\n- Refactoring For C# Devs: https://dometrain.com/course/from-zero-to-hero-refactoring-for-csharp-developers?ref=nick-cosentino\n- [FREE] Intro to Software Development: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzATctVhnsggb3lj53T8fJSK6LJQFUyKS\r\n\r\nüó£Ô∏è Social Media & Links:\r\n- All My Links: https://linktr.ee/devleader\r\n- Vlogs: @DevLeaderBTS @CodeCommute \r\n- Blog: https://www.devleader.ca/\r\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@devleader\r\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickcosentino\r\n- Threads: https://threads.net/@dev.leader\r\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/DevLeaderCa\r\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DevLeaderCa\r\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dev.leader\r\n- GitHub: https://github.com/ncosentino/\r\n- Twitch: https://twitch.tv/devleaderca\r\n- YouTube: https://youtube.com/@DevLeader?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\n‚ù§Ô∏è Affiliations & Products/Services That I Love:\r\n- @BrandGhostAI  for all of my content creation: https://brandghost.ai\r\n- AI shorts helper Opus Clip: https://opus.pro/?via=2f9e97\r\n- VPS hosting from RackNerd: https://my.racknerd.com/aff.php?aff=9013\r\n- VPS hosting from Contabo: https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-101028632-12454592\r\n- Newsletter platform ConvertKit: https://convertkit.com/?lmref=c5X7KQ\r\n- Newsletter referral system SparkLoop: https://dash.sparkloop.app/signup?aff=9fe76c8b\r\n----\r\n#ama #askmeanything #softwareengineering #softwareengineer",
