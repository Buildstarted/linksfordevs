Tried again. Now reading from disk with ATA PIO successfully\n  Day 180: Took another break. lost motivation. Wanted to do other things(v8, embedded, etc.)\n  Day 234: Planned on coming back but World War III just started (October 7th)\n  Day 409: Announcing my return and set a goal - loading an init binary into memory as the first userland process.\n  Day 417: FAT32 Driver and userland VM works! init process/shell is loaded successfully.\n  Day 418: Learning about some GitHub Actions stuff because I’m bored and I don’t want to develop more syscalls.\n\n\nThere are many other things that are still not ready. Like writing to the disk, networking drivers, basic syscalls like execv/fork, etc. I’m not sure if I have the energy to get into it tho. This is why i’m writing this blogpost: if you want to contribute & make a community out of this silly project, join my discord server and we can try to set something up.\n\nEither way, I’m glad I finally published it and didn’t keep it as another project in my archive.
