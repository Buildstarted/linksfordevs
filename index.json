This has become an important step for unified input \n            models where we have tokenized representations of text, images and other modalities present in a single sequence. These types of models are very prone to training instability without appropriate normalization, as the norms of the Q and K vectors can experience exponential growth during training. QKNorm is a necessary (although perhaps not sufficient) step to correct this problem.",
