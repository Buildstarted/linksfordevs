The book’s\ncentral claim is that nearly anyone can achieve seemingly super-human feats of\nmemory with proper technique and deliberate\npractice. Intrigued, I put the some of the\ntechniques to the test and found that they worked surprisingly well. But they\ndid not just work. They converted the hard and shapeless problem of how to\nremember into a problem of discipline and methodology. Remembering became engineering.",

I’ve also become interested in parasites and their obscure effects on people’s health and I think there could be connections. Keep in mind, that the last biology course I took was in high school, and I am ignorant about the underlying chemico biological mechanisms at play here.
