Then you can spawn multiple threads to process each small file. (2) For the output: if all threads output to same file, the write operations must be atomic and it will become bottleneck of the program. So every thread should have its own output file. (3) After all threads exit, main thread can use cat or other methods to consolidate all output files into one."
