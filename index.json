Many developers today have forgotten about it—or never knew it existed.   A few years later, AJAX emerged, revolutionizing the way we approached ",

Doing so allows us to keep a compact representation that can be passed around in machine registers. This is very common in implementing dynamic programming languages, but can really be used anywhere that additional runtime information is needed about a pointer. We will look at a handful of different ways these pointers can be encoded and see how the compiler can optimize them for different hardware.",
