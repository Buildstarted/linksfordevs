The earliest accounts of marbling date back to the 12th century in Japan, where it is known as ‚Äúsuminagashi.‚Äù Inks were floated on top of water and manipulated into delicate, flowing shapes using breath, fans, and other utensils, and finally transferred to paper (and sometimes fabric). Later, paper marbling traditions emerged in the Middle East and Europe, making use of more viscous media and fine-toothed combs to create repeating patterns with greater regularity and control. Marbled paper is commonly used in bookbinding as a decorative endpaper:",
