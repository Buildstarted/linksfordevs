    "Description": "Conventional wisdom in semiconductor manufacturing has long held that bigger chips mean worse yields. Yet at Cerebras, we‚Äôve successfully built and commercialized a chip 50x larger than the largest computer chips ‚Äì and achieved comparable yields. This seeming paradox is one of our most frequently asked questions: how do we achieve a usable yield with a wafer-scale processor?",
