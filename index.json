    "Description": "Is it possible to define a coefficient of correlation which is (a) as simple\nas the classical coefficients like Pearson's correlation or Spearman's\ncorrelation, and yet (b) consistently estimates some simple and interpretable\nmeasure of the degree of dependence between the variables, which is 0 if and\nonly if the variables are independent and 1 if and only if one is a measurable\nfunction of the other, and (c) has a simple asymptotic theory under the\nhypothesis of independence, like the classical coefficients? This article\nanswers this question in the affirmative, by producing such a coefficient. No\nassumptions are needed on the distributions of the variables. There are several\ncoefficients in the literature that converge to 0 if and only if the variables\nare independent, but none that satisfy any of the other properties mentioned\nabove.",
