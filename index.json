I also have a Windows PC and sometimes I needed to use my iPad as second screen for it as well. I tried to look for FREE solutions out there, but I could not find anything that would fit my requirements. Besides, all methods and software I found were different for Windows, Mac and Linux. I got very confused about it. Then I got an idea of creating Deskreen. I decided to make it free and open-source to help people to solve this problem.
