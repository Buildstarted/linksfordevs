This refers to the fact that booleans themselves carry no information apart from their value. But as others have pointed out this is true of all values and the linked article instead refers to the problem as part-blindness and recommends the user to use a good type system. In this article I'll discuss the ideas behind boolean and part blindness and muse on the concept of computing and error checking with options."
