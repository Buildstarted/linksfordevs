The Online Safety Bill, now at the final stage before passage in the House of Lords, gives the British government the ability to force backdoors into messaging services, which will destroy end-to-end encryption. No amendments have been accepted that would mitigate the bill’s most dangerous elements. If it passes, the Online Safety Bill will be a huge step backwards for global privacy, and democracy itself.",

Today I want to talk about why it's a great approach for structuring your applications.\nI'm aware that Clean Architecture isn't a silver bullet, so I will discuss what types of systems can benefit from this architecture.\nClean architecture isn't revolutionary.\nBut it's prescriptive about how you should structure the code.\nIt's an evolution of the layered architecture, focusing on the core domain and the direction of dependencies. All dependencies should point inwards, applying dependency inversion.\nHere are some of the promises of Clean Architecture: - Maintainability - Testability - Loose coupling - Separation of concerns\nIt's independent of UI, databases, or external services - but you also need to be pragmatic (more on this later).\nLet's dive in.",
