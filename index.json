    "Description": "Ever wished you could store semi-structured data in your database without dealing with complex table relationships? Good news! SQL Server has native JSON support, and EF Core makes working with JSON columns easier than ever. Whether you’re handling dynamic configurations, logging data, or flexible user preferences, JSON columns let you mix structured and unstructured data in SQL Server—without creating dozens of extra tables.",

Some of it is valid and some is\n    seen thru rose-colored glasses, but anyone who was there at the\n    time can attest to the fact that it was hard to find\n    stuff. The web was wild, weird, and deeply chaotic. But then\n    I remember back in 2002 or 2003 the feeling of discovering Google\n    and realizing I could stop bouncing around search engines, because\n    this one was better than all the others. I would guess that you,\n    dear reader, either had a similar realization, or that you started\n    using the Web after the rise of Google and may have had trouble\n    imagining a web without it.",

The language was perhaps a bit inflammatory, but I felt the criticisms I made at the time were fair. It was primarily born out some frustrations I had with the entire ecosystem, and it was not like I was the only sole voice. There are other people out there you can find that encountered their own unique Wayland problems and wrote about it.",
