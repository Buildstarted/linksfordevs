    "Description": "A recent paper [Lee {\u001bm et al.}, J. Korean Cryt. Growth Cryst. Techn. {\bf\n33}, 61 (2023)] provides some experimental indications that\nPb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O with $x\u0007pprox 1$, coined LK-99, might be a\nroom-temperature superconductor at ambient pressure. Our density-functional\ntheory calculations show lattice parameters and a volume contraction with $x$\n-- very similar to experiment. The DFT electronic structure shows Cu$^{2+}$ in\na $3d^9$ configuration with two extremely flat Cu bands crossing the Fermi\nenergy. This puts Pb$_{9}$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O in an ultra-correlated regime and\nsuggests that, without doping, it is a Mott or charge transfer insulator. If\ndoped such an electronic structure might support flat-band superconductivity or\nan correlation-enhanced electron-phonon mechanism, whereas a diamagnet without\nsuperconductivity appears to be rather at odds with our results.",

    "Description": "Giorgi Dalakishvili is a software developer with more than a decade of experience. He works mainly with C#,  MVC/ Core, REST, WCF, Xamarin, Android, iOS, Entity Framework, Azure, SQL Server, and Oracle. &nbsp; Giorgi is an open-source author and contributor on GitHub and a member of the .NET Foundation and InfoQ Editor. &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [3:33] Giorgi has worked with all the frameworks and libraries that Microsoft has come out with over the past 10‒15 years. He discusses using Entity Framework and starting his small speaking engagements. [5:12]  is a website where you can put out some different topics that you’d be willing to speak on, and just reach out to different user groups to take the plunge and do some public speaking for the first time. [6:03] Other types of data with Entity Framework beyond relational data, such as hierarchical data type from SQL Server. [8:49] How it simplifies your life. [9:28] What about JSON? Are there any limitations on the back-end database? [13:00] Is the support in EF Core 7.0 good enough to give a try if you’re going against SQL Server? [14:09] What other types of data are interesting to work with with Entity Framework? [14:36] Using geospatial data. What does it even look like? [18:30] Full text search, and how it’s different from a regular text search. [23:20] There are a lot of features to uncover in relational databases that we aren’t even aware of yet. [26:22] There are some problems and some tasks that are better solved with non-relational databases, but the majority can overlap between the two systems. &nbsp; Mentioned in this Episodes:     — New Video Podcast!

    "Description": "A material called LK-99, a modified-lead apatite crystal structure with the\ncomposition Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_{6O}$ ($0.9<x<1.1$), has been\nsynthesized using the solid-state method. The material exhibits the Ohmic metal\ncharacteristic of Pb(6s1) above its superconducting critical temperature,\n$T_c$, and the levitation phenomenon as Meissner effect of a superconductor at\nroom temperature and atmospheric pressure below $T_c$. A LK-99 sample shows\n$T_c$ above 126.85$^\trc$C (400 K). We analyze that the possibility of\nroom-temperature superconductivity in this material is attributed to two\nfactors: the first being the volume contraction resulting from an\ninsulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and the second\nbeing on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by the structural\ndeformation in the one-dimensional(D) chain (Pb2-O$_{1/2}$-Pb2 along the\nc-axis) structure owing to superconducting condensation at $T_c$. The mechanism\nof the room-temperature $T_c$ is discussed by 1-D BR-BCS theory.",
