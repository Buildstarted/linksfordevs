How you write the benchmark scenarios is very similar to unit tests and, therefore, already feels familiar to most developers. The rest is up to the BenchmarkDotNet. It runs the benchmarks. It figures out the number of executions needed to provide steady results. Then, those results are presented in a human-readable form directly in the console. CSV, Markdown and HTML output are in a separate folder.",
