A recent project I worked on has brought me one step closer, but also revealed to me the true complexity of the topic. I am now convinced that I will probably never fully understand the maths behind ECC.\nHowever, I discovered something else that I find interesting, although it’s not necessarily easier: implementing given schemes. In this post, I want to take you on a journey to explore a state-of-the-art implementation of a cryptographic scheme."

While effort estimation is something that everybody in industry is involved with on a regular basis, it is a niche topic in software engineering research.  The problem is researcher attitude (e.g., they are unwilling to venture into the wilds of industry), which has stopped them acquiring the estimation data needed to build realistic models.  A few intrepid people have risked an assault on their ego and talked to people in industry, the outcome has been, until very recently, a small collection of tiny estimation datasets."

The security of the New World we are building online is heavily dependent on password security but, despite this, password reuse and negligence continue to be a problem for the world’s Web users. This lax approach has created the ideal environment for hackers to thrive,  as leaked credentials become replicated across the clean and dark web. To help explore the mechanisms that power these exchanges, we’ve recruited security evangelist and Have I Been Pwned founder Troy Hunt to join our resident cryptographic expert (and Tresorit CEO) Istvan Lam on under CTRL. Stay tuned for news on the biggest threats in cyberspace, the logic behind staying quiet about data breaches and insight into some of the most infamous data breaches of all time.  "
