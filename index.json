You don't really need to know anything concrete about the destination because you'll never have one module talk directly to another!\n\nInstead, we route things through the mediator. The mediator has the responsibility of knowing how to take incoming messages and get them to the right destinations. This means that we use the mediator's API to communicate, and not necessarily the API of the destination directly.\n\nWatch the full video here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tyRwBWGjQk\n\n----\nüì® Sign up for my FREE email newsletter:\nhttps://subscribe.devleader.ca\nüó£Ô∏è Share with your network!\n\n#designpatterns #mediator #designpattern #code",
