Andreessen prompted it to simulate a conversation between a “New York Times journalist and a silicon valley tech entrepreneur” arguing their respective beliefs on freedom of speech.  The model outputted an almost predictably contrived response. Of course the entrepreneur was pro freedom of speech, articulating freedom as an Overton window, and of course the journalist drew a line in the sand “to protect people” against discrimination.  Clearly ChatGPT can regurgitate obvious stereotypes (libertarian vs. progressive views on free speech).  This left me wondering the ways in which ChatGPT parrots biases in its training data and whether ChatGPT might be used to illuminate nuanced stereotypes.",

And if you wonder: No, this is not something you do in your daily life, but by doing so, I can show some cool stuff C# and .NET offer.\n",
