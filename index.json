    "Description": "The rent market in London is insane right now (10/2022). After Brexit and energy crisis in the UK we are facing insane levels of inflation and very high mortgage rates. Which brings us to the renting market problem - families have access to energy bills cuts and most can’t afford to buy a home themselves, causing an insane amount of families looking for houses to rent. Augmenting seriously the inflation rates problem causing room rented to struggle to pay rent and the insane rent increases where for £900 you can’t even’t rent yourself a shitty studio to sleep or a room. The situation is so insane you have companies holding property waiting to increase the rent prices even further and people lining up in front of letting agencies who don’t even have enough properties for all this people to live. The homeless problem in London is only getting worse, you can’t even live like a nomad in hostels anymore because you can’t find a place for the weekend for less than $80 a night. Most low level jobs are paying you £10-£11.5 an hour not keeping with inflation and the current crisis. Food banks have hours long queues and are feeding over half a million people in London, with a population of about 9 million. I am myself looking for a place to stay for almost a month now and still struggling to find one. Fortunetly I have enought money to live and connections to crash so I am not homeless, yet. London is so insane that finding a room in Oxford and commuting by 50m train seems worth it at the moment, eventought the prices are 60% of london prices atleast you can find empty rooms and houses to rent. If I wasn’t still in university I would be out of here in a second, which takes my to the next point. What is happening to London? Gentrification mostly. The people who can’t afford to live here will go elsewhere or become homeless. Even the people who can afford are leaving because they can barely save any money. Is this the end of London? I even built myself a bot to spam on Spareroom which didnt take me very far, altough I finally started getting responses, spamming over 1300 people a day. You still have to lookout for scammers as desperate times always attract the most scammers, which is why I didn’t even adapt the bot to run on Gumtree or Facebook as the huge number of scammers doesn’t even make it worth it. You can checkout the code and use it for free if you find it useful for your situation. All you need is to add the region names in places_search.txt, make search and it will search and spam people with properties to rent in those regions.",
