At this point, I've heard that surprised exclamation enough that I've lost count of the number times that's been said to me (I'd guess that it's more than ten but less than a hundred). If we look at trendy companies that are within a couple factors of two in size of Twitter (in terms of either market cap or number of engineers), they mostly don't have similar expertise, often as a result of path dependence — because they \"grew up\" in the cloud, they didn't need kernel expertise to keep the lights on the way an on prem company does. While that makes it socially understandable that people who've spent their career at younger, trendier, companies, are surprised by Twitter having a kernel team, I don't think there's a technical reason for the surprise."

(With the standard disclaimer that if you say you're going to hurt yourself or someone else I can't keep that secret. I don't think any of the questions here will lead you that way, but my training as a mandated reporter means I instinctively add this caveat.)\n\nWho am I, then, that you should trust me? I'm Shane Liesegang (https://shaneliesegang.com, https://twitter.com/OptimistPanda). I worked in games and adjacent fields for 10+ years (Walt Disney Imagineering, EA [LMNO if that means anything to you], Bethesda [Skyrim, a bit of the Fallouts], Sony [God of War]), but in 2015 I entered the Jesuits on my way to being a Catholic priest. At the moment I'm doing refugee aid work in the Middle East. (Whether you trust me based on any of that is up to you.)\n\nI still love games and care about people who make them and write about them. (Sometimes I even still make / work on games!) Lately I've had a few folks reach out to me asking about other Christians in the gamedev world, and sadly, beyond a couple of people, I mostly have just rumors and guesses. I know of and am a part of a few communities that have an intersection of creative folks and Christianity, but am curious to know who else is out there.\n\nI know that \"Christian\" is a wide net, especially these days. But if you are or have ever thought of yourself as Christian and you are someone who spends their days working on or thinking about games, I'm curious to hear about you."
