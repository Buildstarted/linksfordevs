Event-driven architectures can seem straightforward, but managing state and publishing events requires careful consideration.\n\nYou'll learn about two key methods: the traditional approach involving transactional writes to separate tables, and the modern approach utilizing Amazon DynamoDB streams. I share hands-on code examples and highlight common pitfalls, offering a thorough guide to building resilient event-driven systems. By the end of this video, you'll understand how to ensure reliable state management while publishing events effectively.\n\n00:00 Introduction to Event-Driven Architecture\n00:23 The Challenges of Event Publishing\n01:41 Understanding the Outbox Pattern\n03:38 Traditional Outbox Implementation\n06:18 Modern Outbox with DynamoDB Streams\n07:47 Code Walkthrough: Traditional Outbox\n13:21 Code Walkthrough: DynamoDB Streams\n17:02 Conclusion and Best Practices\n\nCode - https://github.com/jeastham1993/PlantBasedPizza/tree/azure\nDynamoDB Example - https://github.com/jeastham1993/PlantBasedPizza/tree/main/src/PlantBasedPizza.Account",

Naturally, it would be hilarious if the anti-piracy campaign actually turned out to have used this pirated font, so I went sleuthing and quickly found a PDF from the campaign site with the font embedded (https://web.archive.org/web/20051223202935/http://www.piracyisacrime.com:80/press/pdfs/150605_8PP_brochure.pdf).\n\nSo I chucked it into FontForge and yep, turns out the campaign used a pirated font the entire time! ðŸ“Ž",
