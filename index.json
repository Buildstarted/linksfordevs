    "Description": "Stop Using Fandom\n                2024-06-16\n\n     fandom is a wiki website (allegedly)\n\nif you are unfortunate enough to browse a fandom wiki\nwithout an ad blocker, you will experience what i like\nto call \"attention assault\"\n\nupon opening a fandom page (for me, it was the hollow\nknight wiki), you will note the very subtle aroma of a\n1/3 page banner ad, placed ever so daintily at the top of\nthe page.\n\nmy ad was for furniture - ah yes, just what i wanted.\na multi-thousand-dollar furniture purchase to go with my\nvideo game bug lore.\n\ni have been using fandom for 1 second\n\nand i already want to leave\n\n...\n\nas i scroll down, i'm assaulted by an auto-playing video\nad for dog food.\n\ni do not have a dog.\n\nin the top-left corner of the video sits a little \"1/2\",\nindicating the presence of a second ad. another dog food\nad. actually, exactly the same dog food ad.\n\nthis \"content\" is in the middle of the hollow knight\nfandom wiki. when i scroll down, the video shrinks into\nthe bottom-right corner of my screen and stalks me\naround the website, begging for attention.\n\nafter the ads finish playing, a 60 minute video called\n\"honest trailers\" starts. this must be the actual video\nthat i've been sitting through ads to witness.\n\n\"honest trailers\" is not hollow knight related - it's two\nguys vaping & reviewing the new mario movie trailer.\nthey're arguing about whether chris pratt is a good FIT\nto voice act MARIO\n\nafter about 5 seconds (no, i'm not kidding), another ad\nbreak occurs.\n\nit's the same dog food ad. AGAIN.\n\n...\n\nscrolling further down, i reach the end of the wiki page,\nand there are two banner ads waiting, as if to bid me\nfarewell after my arduous journey through this shit-ass\nwebsite.\n\n- one 1/3 page footer ad for Ubisoft+\n- one 1/4 page sidebar ad for sunscreen\n\ni don't need sunscreen. i need fandomscreen.\n\n        .\n       | /\n    '-.;;;.-'\n   -==;;;;;==-\n    .-';;;'-.\n      / | \n        '     [0]\n\n\n          some fandom history\n\nfrom the very beginning, fandom was about profit:\n  2004: jimmy founds wikicities\n  2006: wikicities renamed to wikia\n  2006: random venture capital firms invest $4M\n  2006: amazon.com invests $10M\n  2012: venture firms + amazon invest $11M\n  2014: venture firms invest $15M\n  2016: wikia renamed to fandom\n  2018: enormous private equity firm acquires fandom\n\n  grand total: $40M\n\nand what, dear readers, do venture capitalists want when\nthey invest $40M into something?\n\nreturns. at all costs.\n\nlet the enshittification begin.\n\n> but wait, what does fandom actually _do_?\n\nwhat valuable service does fandom provide to the world?\n\nfandom generates enough money to retain a staff of 300+,\nand rent several offices, including a very beautiful\nbuilding in downtown san francisco.\n\nas far as i can tell, this is fandom's business model:\n  1. users write wiki content on fandom\n  2. fandom displays your content on a wiki page\n  3. pelt fandom visitors with ads\n  4. $$$$$$$$ YUM YUM YUM, MONEY!! $$$$$$$$$\n\n\nmany fandom communities noticed fandom degrading.\n\nat first, it was the ads. huge, annoying, irrelevant ads\nembedded directly in the content.\n\nobtrusive ads obviously suck, but hey, adblockers are a\nthing, so maybe ours users could j...\n\nINTRODUCING:\n  THE MCDONALD'S GRIMACE SHAKE PROMOTION CONTROVERSY!\n\nin 2023, mcdonald's paid fandom an unknown[1] amount of\nmoney to temporarily replace the mcdonald's wiki main\npage + grimace article with advertisements promoting the\ngrimace shake.\n\nthe grimace shake.\n\ni can't make this shit up.\n\nfandom set the precedent that companies could pay them\nand make user content go *poof*\n\n\n           ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢱⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n           ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣷⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n           ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣷⣧⠀⠀⠀\n           ⠀⠀⠀⠀⡀⢠⣿⡟⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀\n           ⠀⠀⠀⠀⣳⣼⣿⡏⢸⣿⣿⣿⢀⠀\n           ⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⡿⠁⢸⣿⣿⡟⣼⡆\n           ⢰⢀⣾⣿⣿⠟⠀⠀⣾⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿\n           ⢸⣿⣿⣿⡏⠀⠀⠀⠃⠸⣿⣿⣿⡿\n           ⢳⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢹⣿⡿⡁\n           ⠀⠹⣿⣿⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⣿⡞⠁\n           ⠀⠀⠈⠛⢿⣄⠀⠀⠀⣠⠞⠋⠀⠀\n           ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n          fandom shall burn\n\nwikis aren't quite like other websites.\n\n  - wiki software is largely open source\n  - wiki content authors are often technical\n  - users don't care where wikis are hosted\n\nthree simple ingredients. one predictable outcome.\n\n              mass exodus.\n\nthe runescape[2] and minecraft[3] communities acted\nfirst, migrating their treasured wikis to their own\ndomains.\n\nmany other wikis followed.\n  hollow knight (yay bugz!)\n  terraria\n  animal crossing\n  stardew valley\n  EVE Online\n  Factorio\n  dota2\n  ...\n  AND MANY, MANY MORE[4]\n\nover 300 wikis have migrated away from fandom, and i can\nonly hope that this trajectory accelerates. nothing makes\nme happier than passionate communities showing everyone\nthat a better world is possible.\n\n\nif you want to help,\n\n  1. download Indie Wiki Buddy\n\n     indie wiki buddy tells you when a fandom page has an\n     alternative community-led wiki. it's a great plugin\n     that will help you support and discover independent\n     wikis.\n\n  2. if you must use fandom, turn on your ad blocker\n  3. if you own a wiki on fandom, move it off!\n\nmy offer: if you are a fandom wiki owner & you would\n          like to move your wiki content elsewhere, i\n          will offer you my expertise at $0/hour. i know\n\t  lots about servers, software, and maintenance.\n\t  just email me - let's get you out of fandom's\n\t  ecosystem.\n\n                  stay weird\n                stay independent\n              fuck venture capital\n           long live the human internet\n\n\n                   LUV,\n                     JES\n\n\n[0]: sun ascii by jgs\n[1]: fandom is a private company & doesn't have to\n     disclose such petty details as \"how much money did\n     mcdonalds give us to tear out user content and\n     replace it with marketing\"\n[2]: https://runescape.wiki\n[3]: https://minecraft.wiki\n[4]: https://getindie.wiki/listings",
