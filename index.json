He's got a ton of amazing content that he puts out regularly, and I'm always very appreciative of how he shares perspective.\n\nWhen my channel had only a couple of hundred subscribers, Dan featured it in a video and it nearly doubled my subscribers over night. I was blown away!\n\nIn the time since then, I've come to appreciate and learn a lot from what Dan shares online. So for me, this was such a rewarding experience.\n\nThanks for hanging out with me, Dan!\n\n----\n\nYou can find Dan at:\n- YouTube: @Codewrinkles \n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-patrascu-baba-08b78523/\n\n----\nüîë Membership & Subscriptions:\n- üì® Weekly Newsletter: https://subscribe.devleader.ca\n- üèòÔ∏è Private Discord Community: https://discord.com/invite/TVY79BZ3Wy\n- üìΩÔ∏è YouTube Membership: https://www.youtube.com/@DevLeader/join\n\nüß† Courses:\n- All Courses: https://www.devleader.ca/courses\n- Nailing The Behavioral Interview: https://dometrain.com/course/career-nailing-the-behavioral-interview/?affcode=1115529_nl-teyzg\n- Getting Started with C#: https://dometrain.com/course/getting-started-csharp?affcode=1115529_nl-teyzg\n- Deep dive C#: https://dometrain.com/course/deep-dive-csharp?affcode=1115529_nl-teyzg\n- C# Zero to Hero BUNDLE: https://dometrain.com/bundle/from-zero-to-hero-csharp/?affcode=1115529_nl-teyzg\n- Reflection in .NET: https://dometrain.com/course/from-zero-to-hero-reflection-in-dotnet/?affcode=1115529_nl-teyzg\n- Refactoring For C# Devs: https://dometrain.com/course/from-zero-to-hero-refactoring-for-csharp-developers?affcode=1115529_nl-teyzg\n- [FREE] Intro to Software Development: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzATctVhnsggb3lj53T8fJSK6LJQFUyKS\n\nüó£Ô∏è Social Media & Links:\n- All My Links: https://linktr.ee/devleader\n- Vlogs: @DevLeaderBTS @CodeCommute \n- Blog: https://www.devleader.ca/\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@devleader\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickcosentino\n- Threads: https://threads.net/@dev.leader\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/DevLeaderCa\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DevLeaderCa\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dev.leader\n- GitHub: https://github.com/ncosentino/\n- Twitch: https://twitch.tv/devleaderca\n- YouTube: https://youtube.com/@DevLeader?sub_confirmation=1\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è Affiliations & Products/Services That I Love:\n- BrandGhost for all of my content creation: https://brandghost.ai\n- AI shorts helper Opus Clip: https://opus.pro/?via=2f9e97\n- VPS hosting from RackNerd: https://my.racknerd.com/aff.php?aff=9013\n- VPS hosting from Contabo: https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-101028632-12454592\n- Newsletter platform ConvertKit: https://convertkit.com/?lmref=c5X7KQ\n- Newsletter referral system SparkLoop: https://dash.sparkloop.app/signup?aff=9fe76c8b\n----\n\n#softwareengineering #softwareengineer #softwaredeveloper #engineering",
