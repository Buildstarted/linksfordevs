A classic example is nonce reuse, which a wide number of symmetric ciphers, signature schemes, and authentication protocols are susceptible to (see CryptoHack challenges “ProSign 3” and “Forbidden Fruit”). In response, cryptographers have come up with algorithms such as EdDSA and AES-GCM-SIV which are designed to thwart such common and catastrophic usage errors. Further, in a perfect world developers wouldn’t be touching primitives at all, but would instead be making use of modern high-level libraries with well-documented APIs and a strong set of algorithms under the hood (libsodium, pyca/cryptography, Tink).",
