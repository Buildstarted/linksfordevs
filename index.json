    "Description": "Over the past few years, there has been a surge in the popularity of frontend frameworks, such as React and Vue. While there are certainly valid use cases for these frameworks, I believe that they are often unnecessary, as most web applications can be adequately served by traditional request/response web pages without any frontend framework. The high usage of these frameworks is largely driven by FOMO and lack of knowledge about alternatives. However, using such frameworks can add unnecessary complexity to your project, as you now have to develop two projects in parallel (the frontend and the backend) and maintain two separate codebases.",
