At first I agreed, maybe because I also felt bummed out by what's happening, but I have since come 180¬∞ on this viewpoint. The Open Web cannot die. As long as there is one person believing in it, it will be there. It's not a thing that you can \"turn it off\", \"fence it in\", \"exclude it\", or whatever else you want to say. The Open Web is what you, as the user, do with it. It will only die if we stop believing.",

    "Description": "Back in the day, I was on my school‚Äôs debate team.\n\nIt was basically a sport for nerds. (In hindsight, my friend group did a lot of ‚Äúsports for nerds‚Äù activities: chess, quiz bowl, competitive gaming, etc.)\n\nAnyway, back to the debate team. We treated it like a sport. We trained for it and attended competitions. It was a lot of fun ‚Äì but deep down, we were there to win.\n\nA stronger, better-researched, more clearly articulated argument was the big key to winning (obvious).\n\nBut there were lots of other ways to score points:\n\n\n  by flustering your opponent with a hard question,\n  catching them off-guard,\n  pointing out something silly they said,\n  and so on.\n\n\nThis is how most people think about debating, whether it‚Äôs on social media or between political candidates. It is eristic (about ‚Äúwinning‚Äù).\n\nObviously, this is a popular form of entertainment. We enjoy the drama. We like seeing other people (particularly those we disagree with) get ‚Äúowned‚Äù / ‚Äúdunked on‚Äù / ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù / etc.\n\nWhat sucks about this is how shallow it is.\n\nMostly in academic circles, there is a less popular and considerably less entertaining form of debate. It is dialectic (about learning through disagreement).\n\nThe ground-rules are different:\n\n\n  \n    You are charitable. You interpret your opponent‚Äôs argument in a strong way, not a weak way.\n  \n  \n    You look for common ground. If you find yourself agreeing on something ‚Äì however small ‚Äì you build from there.\n  \n  \n    You put your ego aside. Being wrong is not a bad thing; it means you‚Äôre learning something new.\n  \n\n\nIn a narrow, self-serving sense, there‚Äôs obviously a lot of value in being persuasive. But in aggregate, it‚Äôs a lot more exciting to actually be right vs. simply being perceived that way.\n\nThis post, and particularly its title, was inspired by this excellent essay by Paul Graham.\n",
