    "Description": "Does it ever feel like the internet is getting worse? That’s been my impression for the last decade. The internet feels now like it consists of ten big sites, plus fifty auxiliary sites that come up whenever you search for something outside of the everyday ten. It feels like it’s harder to find amateur opinions on matters, except if you look on social media, where amateur opinions are shared, unsolicited, with much more enthusiasm than they deserve. The accessibility of the top ten seems like it collapses the internet into a monoculture of extremism, and, perhaps even more disappointingly, a monoculture that echos the offline world.",

But not only does it run our code, it ensures that it runs as fast as possible!\n\nIn this talk we'll take a walk through the internals of the 'Common Language Runtime' (CLR), from a performance perspective. Looking at some of the low-level tricks the .NET Core CLR does to make our code run as fast as possible. Covering 'Value Types', 'Tiered Compilation', 'Stubs' and more.\n\nAfterwards, you'll never take a simple 'method call' for granted again!!\n\n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndclondon.com/",

Indeed, if your subsequent component, let’s say an API, is exposed on Internet, anyone can forge a HTTP Forwarded header.

But not only does it run our code, it ensures that it runs as fast as possible!\n\nIn this talk we'll take a walk through the internals of the 'Common Language Runtime' (CLR), from a performance perspective. Looking at some of the low-level tricks the .NET Core CLR does to make our code run as fast as possible. Covering 'Value Types', 'Tiered Compilation', 'Stubs' and more.\n\nAfterwards, you'll never take a simple 'method call' for granted again!!\n\n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndclondon.com/",
