    "Description": "We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to understand how early-2025 AI tools affect the productivity of experienced open-source developers working on their own repositories. Surprisingly, we find that when developers use AI tools, they take 19% longer than without—AI makes them slower. We view this result as a snapshot of early-2025 AI capabilities in one relevant setting; as these systems continue to rapidly evolve, we plan on continuing to use this methodology to help estimate AI acceleration from AI R&D automation 1.",

Before, it used to generate clean, well-structured code that followed good practices. Now the code feels really basic, sloppy, and sometimes just wrong.  For example:   It used to generate proper Laravel controllers, with form requests, policies, and clean separation. Now it just dumps everything into one messy controller. Blade views used to use my project’s layouts and components properly, sty...",
