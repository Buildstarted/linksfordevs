At the same time, the chasm\nbetween our understanding of these systems and our ability to use them\nseemed to widen even further. It turns out that even our most basic\nassumptions of how these systems can be trained are incomplete at best.\nFor instance, under the supervision of Tom\nGoldstein, researchers showed that novel\ndiffusion models are not‚Äîcontrary to the previous consensus‚Äîoverly\nreliant on Gaussian noise, and in fact, other sources of noise are\nequally valid.1",

However, I ended up learning more than I expected to along this journey. For example, this was the first time I‚Äôve observed clear and somewhat surprising positive transfer across prediction tasks. In particular, I found that predicting additional details about each car (e.g. make and model) improved the accuracy of price predictions. Additionally, I learned a few things about file systems, specifically EXT4, that threw me off guard. And finally, I used AI-powered image editing to uncover some interesting behaviors of my trained classifier.",
