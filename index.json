We got a requirement like application administrators need an option to block the users from signing in to the application via Azure B2C. Here is the solution we found. Since we are storing the user’s object Id in the database along with some properties we are showing the list of users from the database. And we are calling the Graph API from our controller. To do this first we need to create an Azure B2C application. We need to note the ClientId and TenantId details.",
