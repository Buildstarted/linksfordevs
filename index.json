    "Description": "This article will discuss about improving Angular CI build time using Azure DevOps Cache task. If you‚Äôre building Angular applications with Azure DevOps, you will be running npm install command every time even if you‚Äôre not changed anything in the package.json. It is a time consuming process. Azure Devops offers a Cache task, which will help you to cache downloaded libraries or tools your build pipeline. In this example, I am using a minimal angular application, which is added to Azure Repo - you can use GitHub or any other source control supported by Azure DevOps. And then I created a build pipeline for the Angular application."
