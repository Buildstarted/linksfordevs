The repository is back now, thanks to the EFF and its team. They filed a counter-notice on behalf of the youtube-dl maintainers, which allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository."

    "Description": "I know a number of folks use The Great Suspender to automatically suspend\ninactive browser tabs in Chrome. Apparently recent versions of this extension\nhave been taken over by a shady anonymous entity and is now\nflagged by Microsoft as malware. Notably the most recent\nversion of the extension (v7.1.8) has added integrated analytics that can\ntrack all of your browsing activity across all sites. Yikes."
