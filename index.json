    "Description": "Reflecting on it, the reason I think the OceanGate situation has become such a flashpoint for anger is because it's such a perfect microcosm of the problem with everything right now. Decisions are not made based on safety, reasonable caution, or concern for human life. Every decision is instead made from a default assumption of 'what if the bad thing just DIDN'T happen?' We are given pie-in-the-sky promises and sizzle reels and an endless PR hype-cycle for every new innovation and inevitably it fails to work, harms people, and then is maybe barely apologized for before the next bad idea comes down the pike. OceanGate's underengineered, undercooked, doomed submarine isn't merely a metaphor for the hubris of the wealthy, it is a scale model of the way the wealthy dictate our reality. All consequences can be ignored, all blowback can be forestalled, let the end-user eat the cost.\n\nI am not angry because the submarine was badly-made. I am angry because I live in a vastly larger pressure vessel being managed and maintained by the exact same people.\n\nEDIT: jesus tittyslapping christ. apparently this struck a nerve with a lot of people, so I'm just going to say that if you like the manner in which I put words to your lingering dread, consider giving me a donation. I'm very poor and this sumbitch of a post is on like every dang website now(usually unattributed) so I might as well get weed money out of it: https://ko-fi.com/popidol37544 [https://ko-fi.com/popidol37544]",
