With up to\n300k messages published and 1M messages consumed every second, it is a key part of our infrastructure. A few months ago, in our main Kafka cluster, we noticed\nthe following discrepancy: while median response times for produce requests\nwere in single-digit milliseconds, the tail latency was much worse. Namely, the\np99 latency was up to 1 second, and the p999 latency was up to 3 seconds. This was unacceptable for a new project that we were about to start, so we\ndecided to look into this issue. In this blog post, we would like to describe our journey — how we used Kafka protocol sniffing and eBPF to identify and remove\nthe performance bottleneck.\n\n",
