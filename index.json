    "Description": "Image credit: Reddit user u/LtRodFarva\n\n\n\nDevelopers hate legacy code. It’s dirty, it’s crowded, it’s ugly, it’s messy, it’s… old. But we shouldn’t have a negative outlook on legacy or old code. It’s there for a reason, we just need to appreciate that reason.\n\n\n\nWhen starting a new job and getting your first look at the legacy codebase, it’s easy to be frightened or disgusted. If the code has been around for a long time (in Internet years), it probably doesn’t meet modern style guides or follow modern practices. We can easily look at this code and deem it inferior to the code that is being written presently. To do so, though, is to disrespect the developers and the decisions that came before us.\n\n\n\n“Legacy code is established“\n\n\n\nWe need to reframe our minds and stop hating and disrespecting legacy code and instead appreciate it for what it is: legacy code is established. The lines you’re judging are there for a reason; they have lasted the test of time; they have served a purpose. Most importantly of all, they have given you a job. Without those “old” or “ugly” lines of code, you would not have the job that you’re using now to put down that very code.\n\n\n\nProgrammers don’t set out with the intention of writing bad or ugly code. They don’t sit down and think of the most convoluted solution they can write. Code becomes complex, intertwined, and unpleasant over time. Each feature begins with a single typed character and builds from there. As the business grows and its needs change, so does the code. \n\n\n\nA friend of mine once said that “bad” code is the product of not enough time, poorly defined requirements, or inexperience, not necessarily a bad programmer. Business moves fast and as developers, we’re constantly working against the clock to release features to draw in customers and make more money. It’s for these reasons that we must change how we think about and see legacy code – it is not something to be looked down upon, it is a legacy that was passed down to us that we must now carry forward for the next generation of programmers. When we are handed a legacy codebase, it becomes ours to shepherd forward.\n\n\n\nBuild and improve upon the legacy, but overall, respect it."

    "Timestamp": "2021-01-12T16:04:45",
    "Domain": "www.nasdaq.com",
    "Description": "After her website faced repeated domain name revocations, Sci-Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan has registered her website on the distributed domain names network Handshake.\nThe pirated database of academic papers is now accessible directly through the service’s portals as well as through NextDNS, a privacy-focused, cloud-based domain name service resolver which converts IP addresses into domain names.\n“The DNS is like a phonebook for the internet. The addresses in the phonebook are the server IP addresses. DNS was created to give IP addresses human-readable names so with our platform, you’re finding the IP address through Handshake, not through a certificate authority,” Namebase CEO Tieshun Roquerre told CoinDesk.\nRelated: Now Is the Time to Advance the Decentralized Web\nFor a website that has had various domain names revoked over the years and which is now suspended from Twitter, the censorship-resistant DNS will help keep Sci-Hub accessible even as the legacy domain name system applies pressure. \nSci-Hub is a worldwide database of academic publications, which pulls the research papers from under the paywalls of academic magazines and uploads them to the internet for everyone to download and read. It’s maintained by a single coder from Kazakhstan, Alexandra Elbakyan, who is raising donations via Russian payment network Yandex and bitcoin, CoinDesk wrote last year.\nHow does Handshake work?\nHandshake is “is effectively a decentralized domain name server,” Roquerre said. Instead of using the web-standard certificate authority to authenticate user connections to a server, Handshake stores references to the IP address of the websites registered in its system. Namebase is a platform that offers users access to the Handshake network\nThat way, if certificate authority firms try to censor Sci-Hub’s domain name through the legacy system, then people who want to access the site still can through Handshake’s records.\nRelated: The Future of Cryptographic Security in the Age of Quantum\n“If you get censored at the server level, you can switch servers. But if your domain name gets taken down, no one can access your site. As long as the name is intact, you can point it to any server,” he continued. Even if the band website finds a new domain, users may not know whether or not it is authentic (as an example, Roquerre said that Sci-Hub is no stranger to imposter sites).\nTo register a Handshake domain, anyone can propose a website name and place a bid for that website on Handshake’s marketplace with its eponymous HNS token. After a two week auction period, the highest bidder wins the domain (whose blockchain footprint acts like an NFT, Roquerre said) and the tokens are burned.\nRoquerre said that Namebase does not issue tokens and that they are instead mined through Bitcoin-esque proof of work.\nA total number of unique 6,818 Handshake domains are actively in use while roughly 375,000 have been registered, according to Handshake data shared with CoinDesk. The same data showed that marketplace volume has grown 60% on average month-over-month and is anticipated to top $140,000 this month.\nBuilding the decentralized web\nA decentralized domain name system like Handshake could be a significant win in the fight for the decentralized web.\nThe project is part of a crop of so-called Web 3.0 applications vying to create a less centralized, censorship-resistant internet. Handshake, for example, has a complementary browser to create an uncensored internet search experience.\nUrbit, still another web 3.0 hopeful, is more than a decade in development and relies on Ethereum to construct a platform for decentralized personal servers.\nAs evidenced by Sci-Hub’s own problems, the decentralized web is being built out of fears of deplatforming. As the internet’s access points are increasingly centralized in the hands of a few actors, certain applications – most recently, Twitter-alternative Parler – have faced censorship at the hands of web server providers, app stores and DNS certificate authorities.\nCORRECTION (Jan. 12, 2021, 01:15 UTC): This article originally said Namebase built Handshake. Namebase only provides offers users access to the network.\nRelated Stories\n\nBuilding the Next Wave of Web 3.0\nWeb 3.0 Infrastructure Blockchain ‘The Graph’ Now Live on Ethereum"
