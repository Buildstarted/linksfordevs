This interpretation is completely and categorically wrong.\nOriginal Quote It’s very common for statements to lose their original meaning when context has been stripped and that’s exactly what happened here.",

I also restore a random file, whenever I run restic check, to test recoverability.\nShortly after I wrote the previous post, I decided to run restic check --read-data for the first time ever. This reads every file in the repository\nand simulates a full restore. To my utter horror, it reported many errors like\nthese!\nPack ID does not match, want 5e66c2ac, got e80051de\npack d64be86d contains 1 errors: [Blob ID does not match, want 8ebf2c10, got 350f6ba1]",
