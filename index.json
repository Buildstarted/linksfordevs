    "Description": "Imagine you’re running a restaurant. Every time a customer orders, you buy a brand-new frying pan, use it once, and toss it out. Sounds absurd, right? But that’s essentially what happens in EF Core when you create a new DbContext for every request. It’s wasteful, slow, and totally unnecessary. Enter DbContext Pooling: the genius way to reuse those frying pans—err, contexts—and turbocharge your app’s performance.",

SQLite is unique in that it really lives in-process, unlike standalone database servers. There is a feature to that which does not get used very frequently, but can be indispensable in some situations. By the way, the talk about the system that made me me to explore SQLite in anger can now be seen here. Normally it is your Ruby (or Python, or Go, or whatever) program which calls SQLite to make it “do stuff”. Most calls will be mapped to a native call like sqlite3_exec() which will do “SQLite things” and return you a result, converted into data structures accessible to your runtime. But there is another possible direction here - SQLite can actually call your code instead.",
