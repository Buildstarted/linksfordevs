By default EF Core automatically compiles and caches your queries using a hashed representation of the query expression - when the code runs the previously executed query, EF Core lookup the cache with the hash value and returns the compiled query from the cache. We can explicitly compile the query upfront and invoke the compiled query. To compile the query, EF Core exposes two extension methods in EF class - EF.CompileQuery() and EF.CompileAsyncQuery(). These methods helps us to create compiled queries and call them using a delegate.",

For example, a phone knows if it’s held in portrait or landscape orientation, it knows if you’re walking in a certain direction, and it can even detect if you’ve left it on a table screen-up or screen-down. All of this information is calculated internally using various electronic sensors. But, as game devs can we make use of these sensors for our video games? The answer is yes, and it’s relatively straightforward.",
