I‚Äôll show how I tackled slot configurations, DMA bus grants, and the magic of the QBone for emulating boot media. We‚Äôll format a classic DEC hard drive, then load XXDP diagnostics, and prep the system for BSD or RT-11. If you‚Äôre into retro computing, DEC hardware, or PDP-11 restorations, this is your backstage pass to a full rebuild‚Äîfrom backplane setup to kernel tweaks!  \n\nFree Sample of my Book on the Spectrum: https://amzn.to/3zBinWM\n\nWatch ShopTalk Now on Dave's Attic: https://youtu.be/5Emgx0lhllE\n\nFollow me on X: https://x.com/davepl1968\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/davepl",
