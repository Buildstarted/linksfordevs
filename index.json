You can build other storage backends, new types, etc. Postgres itself ships with a number of extensions within the “contrib”. The list of contrib extensions hasn’t changed any time recently, but even contrib is a small sampling of what is possible. Beyond core there is a whole world of extensions, I want dig into just a smalls sampling starting with a few in core…",
