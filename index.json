An API gateway is service that sits between an endpoint and backend APIs, transmitting client requests to an appropriate service of an application. It’s an architectural pattern, which was initially created to support microservices. In this post I am building API Gateway using Ocelot. Ocelot is aimed at people using .NET running a micro services / service orientated architecture that need a unified point of entry into their system.",

    "Description": "The StackExchange.Redis NuGet package is the most popular .NET client for Redis. It’s stable, high-performance, with a great community and wide usage. One of it’s most interesting features is the way it does network multiplexing. This allows multi-threaded applications to use a single TCP/IP connection without blocking. Unfortunately this also means that the library does not support blocking operations such as XREAD BLOCK, which is important if you want to leverage Redis Streams on .NET. This post offers a work-around for this.",
