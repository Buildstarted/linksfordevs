    "Description": "For the last several decades, one avenue of technological progress has towered over nearly everything else: semiconductors. Semiconductors are materials that can have their conductivity varied by many orders of magnitude, which makes it possible to selectively block and allow the flow of electrons. This property makes it possible to manufacture all sorts of electronic devices, not least of which is the digital computer.",

Although the post contained a few well-known attacks, I thought I could expand on them with a greater focus on supply chains which may not be noticed by (especially) smaller organizations. Variations and combinations of each of these may also be a concern.",
