Chris specializes in Windows CE and the .NET Compact Framework, and mobile and embedded device application development. &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [2:22] Fun fact! Chris got a degree in Geology long ago, and his first job was doing seismic work and hand-analyzing a lot of data. Chris talks about his first foray into programming, a job in Excel, writing VBA macros to analyze the data. [4:08] Chris walks us through a job at Microsoft by way of a horse race in Virginia during the .com boom. After the .com crash, he worked at a company that made single board computers and moved to be an engineering manager for the Windows CE department. He was independent for 20+ years before joining , and then  came onto his radar. [6:42] Chris is the owner of the Meadow Core pieces and does a fair bit of the driver development. [8:49] How does the Jetson Nano compare to Raspberry Pi? [13:47] Chris talks about the first goal to run on modern.net. [16:41] What is the vision now to say that we need to do this on Linux? [21:33] Is this the same vision as Maui, to run anywhere embedded? [23:38] How does it impact the process of building, test suites, and different test environments? [24:18] Chris talks about Meadow Test Suite, which has the goal to deploy binaries down to a device and find tests that look just like an xUnit test that can then talk to hardware. [30:56] This totally redefines the term of the “full-stack” developer. [31:12] What can people utilize today, and what is the DevOps chain Chris and his team are using? &nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  — New video podcast!
