    "Description": "This post is about the reason I will probably never try to warn any organisation in Belgium about any vulnerability again. Recently I have been dealing with an attempt at coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) with an organisation in Belgium. This post is not about that, because I‚Äôm not allowed to write about it. This post explains why I believe Belgium is unsafe for people trying to do CVD. I believe it‚Äôs important to warn others so that they know what to expect and can decide for themselves.",

As with other new certificate features on our engineering roadmap, we&rsquo;ll now start gradually rolling out this option to more and more of our subscribers.",

A surprising amount of them revealed to me that they were secretly planning to pursue this path later in their career, or explore it as a passion project.",
