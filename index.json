Essentially, it suggests that it can be more efficient to encode a number using a variable-length representation instead of a fixed-size binary representation. By removing leading zeros from the binary number, the overall representation size can be reduced. This technique works particularly well for encoding smaller numbers.\nIn this article, I provide a brief introduction and rationale for varint encoding.",

Android users also get another major quality of life upgrade - Dolphin now is now a Document Provider on Android. This means you can use Dolphin to directly copy files into and out of its per-app directory on the latest versions of Android.\nIn this report, we'll be going through both of these and several other important changes.
