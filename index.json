It says that runners improve most effectively when 80% of their running is at low intensity, with the remaining 20% done at higher intensity.\nThis approach recognises the value of high-volume, ‚Äúeasy‚Äù runs and aims to avoid what‚Äôs known as the ‚Äúgrey zone‚Äù of training. These are runs that are too hard to be easy and too easy to be hard. Research shows that this way of training provides limited aerobic benefit, whilst contributing significantly to fatigue.
