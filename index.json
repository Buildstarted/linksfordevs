    "Description": "What is a Mental Stack? I enjoy playing fighting games like Street Fighter. There’s a concept prevalent in Street Fighter (and fighting games generally) called the “Mental Stack”.\nThe “Mental Stack”, as defined by Yassin Hussein at Redbull ESports is “how much a player needs to keep track of during the match”. The current release Street Fighter 6 has a noticeably taller mental stack than previous iterations of the series, with a significantly higher amount of mechanics, special moves, offensive and defensive strategies than the “Super Turbo” arcade cabinets of yore.",
