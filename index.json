    "Description": "A word-as-image is a semantic typography technique where a word illustration\npresents a visualization of the meaning of the word, while also preserving its\nreadability. We present a method to create word-as-image illustrations\nautomatically. This task is highly challenging as it requires semantic\nunderstanding of the word and a creative idea of where and how to depict these\nsemantics in a visually pleasing and legible manner. We rely on the remarkable\nability of recent large pretrained language-vision models to distill textual\nconcepts visually. We target simple, concise, black-and-white designs that\nconvey the semantics clearly. We deliberately do not change the color or\ntexture of the letters and do not use embellishments. Our method optimizes the\noutline of each letter to convey the desired concept, guided by a pretrained\nStable Diffusion model. We incorporate additional loss terms to ensure the\nlegibility of the text and the preservation of the style of the font. We show\nhigh quality and engaging results on numerous examples and compare to\nalternative techniques.",
