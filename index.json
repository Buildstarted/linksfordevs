    "Description": "\n\n\nIn the fast-paced world of software engineering, an industry characterized by an average tenure between 1-2 years1, the notion of seniority has always been somewhat fluid. It is an environment where you‚Äôre expected to go from ‚Äúnew grad‚Äù to ‚Äúsenior‚Äù within 36 months, which presents a pace much faster than in most other professions. And yet, this swift movement through ranks, this very structure of seniority, faces disruption at the hands of emerging technologies, namely Language Learning Models (LLMs) like Copilot and ChatGPT.\nThe Changing Dynamics of Workflow\nTo understand the seismic shift that‚Äôs underway, you only have to ask the seasoned engineers in your team: has Copilot or ChatGPT had an impact on your workflow? Anecdotal evidence2 will tell you that in a vast majority of cases, these tools have indeed been revolutionary, despite the shaky early criticisms of Copilot. LLMs have the potential to churn out low-level code, provide debugging insights, and even advise on high-level architecture, amplifying productivity in an unprecedented way.\nThe immediate repercussion, however, is a trend toward hiring fewer interns and junior engineers. In a world where an LLM can augment the efforts of a mid-level or senior engineer so effectively, the traditional utility of the junior engineer  as a ‚Äúcode monkey‚Äù diminishes. The landscape becomes further treacherous for aspiring engineers, considering the spate of recent layoffs in tech companies.3 4 5",
