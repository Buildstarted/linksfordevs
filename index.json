    "Timestamp": "2022-06-21T16:01:43",

    "Description": "I figured out how to run a SQL query directly against a CSV file using the `sqlite3` command-line utility:\n\n    sqlite3 :memory: -cmd '.mode csv' -cmd '.import taxi.csv taxi' \n      'SELECT passenger_count, COUNT(*), AVG(total_amount) FROM taxi GROUP BY passenger_count'\n\nThis uses the special `:memory:` filename to open an in-memory database. Then it uses two `-cmd` options to turn on CSV mode and import the `taxi.csv` file into a table called `taxi`. Then it runs the SQL query.\n\nYou can get `taxi.csv` by downloading the compressed file from [here](https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq/blob/43e72ff1d2c871082fed0ae401dd59e2ff9f6cfe/testdata/taxi.csv.7z) and running:\n\n    7z e -aos taxi.csv.7z\n\nI figured this out while commenting on [this issue](https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq/issues/70).\n\nThe output looks like this:\n\n```\n\"\",128020,32.2371511482553\n0,42228,17.0214016766151\n1,1533197,17.6418833067999\n2,286461,18.0975870711456\n3,72852,17.9153958710923\n4,25510,18.452774990196\n5,50291,17.2709248175672\n6,32623,17.6002964166367\n7,2,87.17\n8,2,95.705\n9,1,113.6\n```\n\nAdd `-cmd '.mode column'` to output in columns instead:\n```\n$ sqlite3 :memory: -cmd '.mode csv' -cmd '.import taxi.csv taxi' -cmd '.mode column' \n    'SELECT passenger_count, COUNT(*), AVG(total_amount) FROM taxi GROUP BY passenger_count'\npassenger_count  COUNT(*)  AVG(total_amount)\n---------------  --------  -----------------\n                 128020    32.2371511482553 \n0                42228     17.0214016766151 \n1                1533197   17.6418833067999 \n2                286461    18.0975870711456 \n3                72852     17.9153958710923 \n4                25510     18.452774990196  \n5                50291     17.2709248175672 \n6                32623     17.6002964166367 \n7                2         87.17            \n8                2         95.705           \n9                1         113.6            \n```\nOr use `-cmd '.mode markdown'` to get a Markdown table:\n\n| passenger_count | COUNT(*) | AVG(total_amount) |\n|-----------------|----------|-------------------|\n|                 | 128020   | 32.2371511482553  |\n| 0               | 42228    | 17.0214016766151  |\n| 1               | 1533197  | 17.6418833067999  |\n| 2               | 286461   | 18.0975870711456  |\n| 3               | 72852    | 17.9153958710923  |\n| 4               | 25510    | 18.452774990196   |\n| 5               | 50291    | 17.2709248175672  |\n| 6               | 32623    | 17.6002964166367  |\n| 7               | 2        | 87.17             |\n| 8               | 2        | 95.705            |\n| 9               | 1        | 113.6             |\n\nA full list of output modes can be seen like this:\n\n```\n% sqlite3 -cmd '.help mode'\n.mode MODE ?TABLE?

It's a LOT slower than using `sqlite3` directly though.\n\n[dsq](https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq) is a tool that does this kind of thing (and a lot more). Author Phil Eaton compiled [a collection of benchmarks](https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq#benchmark) of other similar tools, and his [benchmarking script](https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq/blob/43e72ff1d2c871082fed0ae401dd59e2ff9f6cfe/scripts/benchmark.sh) demonstrates how to use each one of them.",

    "Description": "I have been think­ing about ways to op­tim­ize a work­load that util­izes a WebAssembly runtime with JIT code gen­er­a­tion cap­ab­il­it­ies a lot re­cently. This runtime im­ple­ment­a­tion util­izes a fairly typ­ical con­struc­tion for a JIT-­based en­gine, how­ever the work­load util­izes the runtime in some­what an un­usual man­ner. Every time some func­tion within a mod­ule is in­voked, it will be within a fresh in­stance. Fur­ther­more, the in­voc­a­tions are user­-­gen­er­ated and will in­volve reas­on­ably ran­dom­ized set of WebAssembly mod­ules, pre­clud­ing the ap­plic­a­tion of a cache which would oth­er­wise help sig­ni­fic­antly in this sort of situ­ation. This work­load def­in­itely poses a fair share of in­ter­est­ing chal­lenges for me to beat!",

But event's can be tricky to use, especially when you want to have a continuous flow in your application.\nThat is where TaskCompletionSource comes into play. We can \"transform\" an event based function into something which is await-able from the outside world via the await keyword.\n",
