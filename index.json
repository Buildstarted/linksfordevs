In his blog post Damien showed how to set up an ASP.NET Core application to obtain a credential from the Trinsic platform. In this part we are going to look at how we can verify these credentials in order to continue some sort of business process. We will continue with the sample that Damien started and after obtaining our driver license we want to sign up for a new insurance. But we can only sign up at this insurance company if we can deliver proof of our driver license."
