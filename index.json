In the past, I might have thought, \"Playing games like this would be ruinous, leading to personal downfall.\" But now, as I've grown older, I've stopped worrying about these concerns and am thoroughly enjoying this obsession. I'm living in the moment.   Throughout my life, I've only occasionally found activities so captivating that I'd sacrifice sleep for them, perhaps once every five years.   First, there was soccer in elementary school, then guitar and drums in high school. After that, I got into FPS games and eventually found programming, which led to a career. Later, I enjoyed reading comics and books at a leisurely pace; it was more of a gradual enjoyment rather than an obsession that would cost me sleep.   A few years ago, I had a brief but intense period of playing Valorant, another FPS game. The daily happiness and the time spent improving during that",
