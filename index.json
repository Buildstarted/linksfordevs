Winters in New England can be pretty dry,\nso we have a $40 humidifier 1 at home that, well, humidifies the room. Naturally, I want a HomeKit-enabled\nhumidifier. However, Apple’s website lists only one model currently on sale, and that model has a very\nsmall water tank which won’t last even a day. Meanwhile, I have a Raspberry Pi Zero W lying around, so it seems\na good idea to put the Raspberry Pi into the humidifier to add HomeKit support. After all, everyone wants\na humidifier with an 1 GHz ARM processor inside, isn’t it?"

    "Description": "Recently I have become curious about the Gemini\nProject and the content that people have\nmade available to be retrieved over the gemini:// protocol.  I’m not convinced\nby the arguments for not just using http, and mostly it’s just that I\ntypically find more things that I am interested in casually reading through on\npeople’s gemlogs than I would on, say, reddit, and similar aggregators.  But\npresumably advocates of gemini:// and the text/gemini format would argue that\nit’s various respects in which it differs from the web that makes geminispace\nconducive to the production of the sort of content you find there.  So I’m\nremaining open minded about the possibility that having a completely separate\nprotocol is important, and not just an annoyance because rss2email doesn’t\nwork and I had to spend time writing\ngmi2email."
