His point was that anyone who takes a systematic approach to managing their time – with some combination of to-do lists, plans, schedules, and so on – inevitably incurs overheads. Those lists and plans take time and effort, and for some smaller tasks, it's simply not worth it. By the time you've \"clarified the next action\", or made an entry on a list, or scheduled a time to focus on it, you could have just done the thing.",
