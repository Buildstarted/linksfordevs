    "Description": "Should we commit vendor in our Go projects?\n\nSince the introduction of Go modules, the prevalent\nopinion on the internet is that we should not commit\nthe vendor directory of our projects.\n\nThe argument against committing vendor is that it‚Äôs\nunnecessary, because the Go tools can resolve and find\ndependencies when needed on-the-fly. All public Go modules are\nalso hosted by various Go Proxy servers for redundancy.\n\nWhile I agree that it‚Äôs technically\nunnecessary and bloats the repo, I‚Äôd like to give some\narguments in favour of committing vendor.\n\nHere is a list of arguments for committing vendor:\n\n\nBuilding the project doesn‚Äôt depend on some code\nbeing available on Github/Gitlab/‚Ä¶ or the Go Proxy\nservers. Open source projects may disappear because of\ncensorship, authors incentives, licensing changes or\nsome other reasons I can‚Äôt currently think of.\nNot in your repo, not your code.\n\nWe may use internal or 3rd party Go modules (private)\nwhich may also disappear or become inaccessible, but if\nthey are committed in vendor, they are part of our\nproject and nothing breaks unexpectedly.\n\nGo modules may not follow semantic versioning, which\nmeans the Go tools will rely on the latest commit hash\nwhen fetching them on-the-fly. Repo history may be\nrewritten (e.g. rebase) and you, a colleague or your CI job\nmay end up with different code for the dependencies they use.\n\nCommitting vendor can improve your code review process.\nTypically, I‚Äôm used to committing dependency changes in a\nseparate commit, so they can be easily viewed if the reviewer\nis curious.\n\n\nHere‚Äôs an interesting observation related to bloating the repo.\nIf I make code review, and a team member has included a new\ndependency with 300 files (or updated one with 300 files\nchanged), I would be pretty curious to deep dive into that\nand start a discussion about the code quality, the need for\nthis change or alternative Go modules. This may lead us to\nactually decrease our binary size and overall complexity.\n\nIf I just see a single new line in go.mod in new MR, chances\nare I won‚Äôt even think about it.\n\n\nCI/CD jobs which perform compilation and build steps need\nnot waste time and network to download the dependencies\nevery time the CI job is executed. All needed dependencies\nare local and present (go build -mod vendor)\n\nAs a pseudo argument I can ask why important open source\nGo projects like Kubernetes\nare committing vendor, if it‚Äôs not necessary?\n\n\nConclusion\n\nFor my own peace of mind I would always prefer to commit the\nvendor directory alongside go.mod and go.sum\nwhile at the same time try to keep the project dependencies\nat minimum.\n\n\n  \n    \n      warning\n    \n  \n  The vendor directory SHOULD NOT be committed for Go\nlibraries, frameworks or code which doesn‚Äôt produce\nexecutable binaries, unless you have a really good\nreason to do it.\n\n",
