Strehovsky shares his personal projects BFlat and Flattened.NET that allow .NET developers to play with the technology and non-.NET developers to get into .NET. Through the use of unsupported territories and ahead-of-time compilation, Strehovsky was able to create a self-contained WinForms Snake game in C# that was under 8KB in size. This podcast is a must-listen for anyone interested in reducing the size of their .NET applications and exploring the versatility of the technology",
