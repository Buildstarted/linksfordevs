QA verified the bug and assigned it to me for fixing. The project was quite big (although far from the largest ones); it took 40 minutes to build on my machine. The instructions on the bug report said: “Play the game for 5-10 minutes until it crashes”. Sure enough, after following instructions, I observed a crash. I fired up WinDbg ready to nail it down. Unfortunately, the stack trace was bogus:\n0:049&gt; k\n# Child-SP RetAddr Call Site\n00 00000022`e25feb10 00000000`00000010 0x00007ffa`00000102\n0:050&gt; u 0x00007ffa`00000102 L10\n00007ffa`00000102 ?? ???\n^ Memory access error in 'u 0x00007ffa`00000102 l10'\nClearly, it tried executing an invalid memory address. Although the stacktrace had been corrupted, I was hoping that only a part of the whole stack got corrupted and that I should be able to reconstruct it if I look at memory contents past the stack pointer register. Surely enough, that gave me an idea where to look next:\n0:049&gt; dps @rsp L200\n...............\n00000022`e25febd8 00007ffa`b1fdc65c ucrtbased!heap_alloc_dbg+0x1c

now I knew which thread was crashing: it was the IL2CPP runtime socket polling thread. Its responsibility is tell other threads when their sockets are ready to send or receive data. It goes like this: there’s a FIFO queue that socket poll requests get put in by other threads, the socket polling thread then dequeues these requests one by one, calls select() function and when select() returns a result, it queues a callback that was in the original request to the thread pool. So somebody is corrupting the stack badly. In order to narrow the search, I decided to put “stack sentinels” on most stack frames in that thread. Here’s how my stack sentinel was defined:\n",
