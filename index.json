    "Description": "This has been a hard post for me to write after participating in WordPress since before I even started a career in tech and, until 3 months ago, for my entire tech career. That said, it has been in the making for quite a while now and it is time that I make it official.\nI’ve officially left the WordPress project after 14+ years of contributing including:\nMeetup and WordCamp Speaker Meetup and WordCamp Organizer Core code contributor Plugin developer Photo contributor Over 11 years as mostly the sole moderator for the official WordPress jobs site Why leave now? It’s true that I had largely been moving away from the WordPress project since at least 2017. I think that is when I realized just how dishonest so much of the “community” around WordPress really is.",

    "Description": "In the 1950s, computers did not really interoperate. ARPANET has not yet happened (that would become a thing in the 60s), and every operating system was typically tied to the hardware that was meant to run on. Most communication actually happened over telephone, and no company was more present in that space than the Bell System. Unfortunately, the way they were so present was through exclusive supply contracts (with its subsidiary Western Electric) and a vast array of patents that it would refuse to license to competitors. So they got an antitrust suit aimed at them, which after seven years of litigation culminated in the 1956 consent decree. The Bell System was broken up, obliged to license all of its patents royalty-free, and barred from entering any industry other than telecommunications. So they made Unix.",

You’ll see how I integrated it with LEDs for colors, wipes, fades, and even a flame effect. We dive into the science behind linear fiber optics and total internal reflection, plus explore how the etched design channels the light just where it’s needed.\n\nFinally, we tackle the big question: is this legal for the road? We review both federal and state laws and examine the nuances that determine what’s street-legal.\n\nIf you enjoy tech, optics, or unique car mods, stick around for today’s deep dive in Dave’s Garage!\n\nFree Sample of my Book on the Spectrum: https://amzn.to/3zBinWM\n\nDave's Attic - Friday 4PM Podcast - https://www.youtube.com/@UCtb6a_CnmGbSns9G8W2Ny0w \n\nCustom LED License Plate Cover Vendor:  https://illum-industries.com/\nM5 Stick C Plus: https://m5stack.com/\nSK6812 Strips: https://amzn.to/48ueEaz\n\nTOMLOV Microscope: https://amzn.to/3BZSlxf\n(Currently offered at $239 after you check the coupon box, so don't miss that!)\n\nFollow me for updates!  \nTwitter:   @davepl1968 davepl1968\nFacebook: fb.com/davepl",
