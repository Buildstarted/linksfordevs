    "Description": "\nMeditation is great — most of us can agree on that. But like exercise, it’s been overcomplicated. There are just so many forms of it: guided, silent, body scans, vipassana, kriyas. There are apps, videos, retreats, books, and self-proclaimed gurus—everyone’s selling their version.\n\nIts benefits have also been oversold. People are led to believe it’s a one-stop solution for all mental health issues, and at worst, a path to everlasting bliss. Do a week of Vipassana and your mind will be permanently transformed.\n\nI can’t speak for everyone, but that hasn’t been my experience.\n\nMeditation, to me, is just a tool to denoise the brain — and that’s become crucial in an age of constant overstimulation. Denoising helps you tune into the present, improves your focus, helps you identify the negative thought patterns, and also, softens their grip.\n\n## Transcendental Meditation\n\nOnce I reframed what meditation *is*—a tool to denoise the brain—I had much more realistic expectations. After experimenting with various techniques, I found one that fits perfectly: Transcendental Meditation.\n\nDon't worry, the name makes it sound advanced, but it’s actually the simplest one I’ve tried.\n\nThat said, it’s promoted by an organization that is borderline scammy (trying too hard to sell something), so good info is weirdly hard to find without paying. But the technique itself? Surprisingly easy and effective.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n**Just close your eyes and repeat a simple word or mantra <u>in your mind</u> (like, _om_, _shrim_, or _namah_). It should be pleasant sounding and ideally meaningless. Don’t try to control your thoughts. If your mind drifts, gently return to repeating the mantra.**\n\nThat’s it. Sit on a chair, sit cross-legged, or lie down, doesn’t matter. Set a timer for 15–20 minutes, or go by feel. Do it in a park, or at home; in the morning, evening, or at night.\n\n​Everything is up to you. \n\n## Why it works?\n\nLike I said earlier, meditation is just a way to denoise your brain. Whether you focus on your breath, your body, or a mantra — it’s all aiming for the same outcome.\n\nRepeating a word in your head is especially effective because, oddly enough, **the mind can only focus on one thing at a time**. When you repeat the word, it gently cuts off wandering thoughts. Over time, this starts to clear the mental clutter. Your mind calms down and you become more in tune with the present, and your own thought patterns.\n\nWhen I practice it, I feel less overwhelmed, more focused, and the urge to doomscroll quiets down. And at night, it’s incredibly helpful for falling asleep.\n\nIf meditation is supposed to be a path to everlasting bliss, then I’m probably not on it — and honestly, that’s okay.\n\n---\n\nPeople have claimed all sorts of things about meditation, but in my experience, it's not necessary to explore the depth of consciousness to be reasonably happy. It’s healthier to approach meditation with more grounded expectations. \n\nBut that's my take.  If you want to transform your mind, you're better off exploring a retreat or something similar.\n",
