    "Domain": "www.medrxiv.org",
    "Description": "Identifying the extent of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is crucial for understanding possible long-term epidemic dynamics. We analysed longitudinal PCR and serological testing data from a prospective cohort of 4411 US employees in four states between April 2020 and February 2021. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression investigating the association between baseline serological status and subsequent PCR test result in order to calculate an odds ratio for reinfection. We estimated an adjusted odds ratio of 0.09 (95% CI: 0.005 – 0.48) for reinfection, implying that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline is associated with around 91% reduced odds of a subsequent PCR positive test. This suggests that primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides protection against reinfection in the majority of individuals, at least over a sixth month time period. We also highlight two major sources of bias and uncertainty to be considered when estimating reinfection risk, confounders and the choice of baseline time point, and show how to account for both in our analysis.\n\n### Competing Interest Statement\n\nGA is a founder of Seromyx Systems Inc., a company developing platform technology that describes the antibody immune response. GA's interests were reviewed and are managed by Massachusetts General Hospital in accordance with their conflict of interest policies.
