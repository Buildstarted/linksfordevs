I am no AI engineer and I barely remember the Machine learning/ Neural network courses I took in college, but given my computer security background, what better way to learn how these LLM’s work than by trying to break them? In this post, we look at the basics of AI security, current “known” attacks, common defenses and some CTF challenges. I’ve been meaning to write this post for a while but this field was moving so fast that keeping up latest publications is a full time job.
