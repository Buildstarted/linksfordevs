In reality, they are largely additive: you don't have to fetch your data on the server and you don't have to run a server at all. What React Server Components do is give you optionality to decide where you want your code to run: the server, the client, or both. And when: build-time or run-time. It gives you the ability to move between those environments seamlessly through composition. For experts who want freedom of choice, RSCs are a powerful solution. If you find them confusing, it's because nothing like them has existed before, but once you internalize their design, you'll see why their ideas will live on for a long time.",
