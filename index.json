They can also be easily migrated into Microservices if you decide to do so.\nI've built and maintained several Modular monolith systems in the past years.\nIn this week's newsletter, I want to focus on the communication patterns in the Modular monolith architecture.\nBut first, let me explain what is a Modular monolith.",
