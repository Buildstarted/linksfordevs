    "Description": "Mobile devices have become an indispensable component of modern life. Their\nhigh storage capacity gives these devices the capability to store vast amounts\nof sensitive personal data, which makes them a high-value target: these devices\nare routinely stolen by criminals for data theft, and are increasingly viewed\nby law enforcement agencies as a valuable source of forensic data. Over the\npast several years, providers have deployed a number of advanced cryptographic\nfeatures intended to protect data on mobile devices, even in the strong setting\nwhere an attacker has physical access to a device. Many of these techniques\ndraw from the research literature, but have been adapted to this entirely new\nproblem setting.\n  This involves a number of novel challenges, which are incompletely addressed\nin the literature. In this work, we outline those challenges, and systematize\nthe known approaches to securing user data against extraction attacks. Our work\nproposes a methodology that researchers can use to analyze cryptographic data\nconfidentiality for mobile devices. We evaluate the existing literature for\nsecuring devices against data extraction adversaries with powerful capabilities\nincluding access to devices and to the cloud services they rely on. We then\nanalyze existing mobile device confidentiality measures to identify research\nareas that have not received proper attention from the community and represent\nopportunities for future research.",
