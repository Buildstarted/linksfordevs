I hope this can be helpful for younger security teams that need to understand how to identify and mitigate phishing abuses for the first time.\nThreat model When you work in the startup ecosystem long enough, you learn that company cybersecurity risks are not only related to IT failures or the OWASP Top 10 but also to reputation. It doesn‚Äôt matter if your infrastructure is solid and redundant, if your engineers follow best practices, if you have real-time monitors and alerts in place, or if you implement other good practices: if stakeholders don‚Äôt trust your security standards, you are not secure in their eyes. This is why startups and companies invest money and time into security certifications like ISO 27001 or SOC 2 Type 2 (though this is a controversial topic, and I have strong opinions on it, I won‚Äôt delve into that now).",

    "Description": "We introduce LADDER (Learning through Autonomous Difficulty-Driven Example Recursion), a framework which enables Large Language Models to autonomously improve their problem-solving capabilities through self-guided learning by recursively generating and solving progressively simpler variants of complex problems. Unlike prior approaches that require curated datasets or human feedback, LADDER leverages a model's own capabilities to generate easier question variants. We demonstrate LADDER's effectiveness in the subject of mathematical integration, improving Llama 3.2 3B's accuracy from 1% to 82% on undergraduate-level problems and enabling Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve 73% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination. We also introduce TTRL (Test-Time Reinforcement Learning), where we perform reinforcement learning on variants of test problems at inference time. TTRL enables Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve a state-of-the-art score of 90% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination, surpassing OpenAI o1's performance. These results show how self-directed strategic learning can achieve significant capability improvements without relying on architectural scaling or human supervision.",
