So an attempt to insert the string '123' results\nin an integer 123 being inserted.  But if the content cannot be losslessly\nconverted into an integer, for example if the input is 'xyz', then\nthe original string is inserted instead.\nSee the Datatypes In SQLite document for additional information."
