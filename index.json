But\npresumably advocates of gemini:// and the text/gemini format would argue that\nit’s various respects in which it differs from the web that makes geminispace\nconducive to the production of the sort of content you find there.  So I’m\nremaining open minded about the possibility that having a completely separate\nprotocol is important, and not just an annoyance because rss2email doesn’t\nwork and I had to spend time writing\ngmi2email."
