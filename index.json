In some small flaky\nfragments, we successfully observed ``half levitation'' atop a\n$\\mathrm{Nd_2Fe_{14}B}$ magnet. Using magnetization measurements on such small\npieces, as well as on a large piece which does not exhibit the half levitation,\nwe show that the samples ubiquitously contain weak yet definitive soft\nferromagnetic components. We argue that, together with the pronounced shape\nanisotropy of the small fragments, the soft ferromagnetism is sufficient to\nexplain the observed half levitation in strong vertical magnetic fields. Our\nmeasurements do not indicate the presence of the Meissner effect, nor zero\nresistance, in our samples, leading us to believe that our samples do not\nexhibit superconductivity.",

There’s no free lunch.\nChoosing how much time to invest in testing is all about balancing how confidently you can say your program is doing what you intend to and how fast you can modify or add to your program.",

Now, let  be our trajectory, and  be the number of times that . Since\n\nthe question of whether the random walk we have described is recurrent comes down to whether the central binomial coefficient grows quickly enough to make this series diverge. Does it? We can also consider the random walk on , moving at each step by an increment in the set , in which case the expected number of visits to the origin is\n\nWhen are these processes recurrent? To answer either question, we need to figure out something about the asymptotic growth of central binomial coefficient.",

The existing program had hard-coded rules for\npackage selection that made it require frequent repairs, and it didn’t play nice\nwith modularity packages. Since the new solution should be an improvement over\nthe old one, I decided to separate the rules from the code, and for this I needed\na small domain-specific language.
