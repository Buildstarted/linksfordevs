    "Description": "This article explores the transition from a WebSocket-based implementation to a simpler, more direct stream over HTTP in the context of capturing touch screen inputs on Linux.\nIt begins by introducing the main theme, encapsulated in the statement Everything is a file is a stream of byte. The need to capture finger positions on a touchscreen by reading /dev/input/events in Linux is initially discussed, followed by a dilemma of transferring this data to a JavaScript client in a browser.\nInitially, WebSockets are chosen, leading to a discussion on how frameworks often shape our technological choices and the challenges faced in debugging WebSocket connections. The article then introduces an alternative about sending a stream of bytes over HTTP, drawing a parallel to Linux’s approach to handling devices and files.\nSerialization, the process of encoding messages for this stream, is discussed next, highlighting the implementation specifics in GoLang and its native advantages. The final section covers how to receive and decode this stream in JavaScript within a worker thread, and then send the decoded messages to the main thread using post requests.\nThe article concludes by reflecting on the benefits of simplicity in technology, urging readers to reevaluate default choices and consider more straightforward solutions to complex problems.\n",
