Its most prominent use so far is GitHub Copilot, which is an extension for VSCode1 that autocompletes code being edited. However, there are many uses for Codex beyond code completion. OpenAI recently ran the OpenAI Codex Challenge, where competitors were tasked with solving various programming tasks, and could use Codex to help them. I participated in the challenge and got 75th place2. Due to some overloaded servers during the challenge, many people were unable to actually do actually compete, so that ranking is mostly due to me figuring out the best times to reload to get the challenge to work. After the challenge, OpenAI sent me an invite to try out the Codex model, which I used to do the testing in the post."

Today, debugging through them is not so easy as debugging your projects that are part of your solution. Starting with Visual Studio 2022 Preview 3, we are adding a new \"External Sources\" node in the Solution Explorer which will make debugging external sources files much easier. This node appears while debugging and will show sources for managed modules with symbols loaded containing Source Link or Source Server information. You can effortlessly browse those sources files and debug through them by placing breakpoints if needed."
