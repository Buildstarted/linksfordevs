His professional journey includes roles as Principal Software Architect at PKWARE, Senior Backend Engineer at Fetch Rewards, and Staff Software Engineer at Bold Penguin, where he consistently designed high-performance, scalable systems.\n\nDave's current passion project, Contextium, represents the culmination of his technical expertise and intellectual interests. This system transforms natural language into deep semantic graphs -- and vice versa -- through innovative knowledge representation techniques. Contextium employs a symbolic, rules-based approach to NLP rather than relying solely on statistical methods, allowing for precise semantic understanding and addressing critical limitations in current AI systems, for example hallucinations in large language models.\n\nA published author with O'Reilly Media, Dave wrote 'Programming Visual Basic .NET' (2001) and 'CDO & MAPI Programming with Visual Basic' (2000), demonstrating his ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly.\nOver his long career, Dave has worked in many languages and tech stacks. His interests extend beyond pure engineering to theoretical aspects of AI, consciousness, and the intersection of symbolic and neural approaches to machine intelligence.\n\nYou can follow Dave on Social Media\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/davegrundgeiger/\n\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO THE PODCAST\n\n- Spotify: http://isaacl.dev/podcast-spotify\n- Apple Podcasts: http://isaacl.dev/podcast-apple\n- Google Podcasts: http://isaacl.dev/podcast-google\n- RSS: http://isaacl.dev/podcast-rss\n\nYou can check out more episodes of Coffee and Open Source on https://www.coffeeandopensource.com\n\nCoffee and Open Source is hosted by Isaac Levin (https://twitter.com/isaacrlevin)",
