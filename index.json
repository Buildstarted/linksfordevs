They link to sites sometimes, but they‚Äôd much prefer searchers stay on the results page and ask followup questions. Engagement numbers and all that.\nThese companies run mass content scraping campaigns to train their own slop models and provide servers to other slop companies in the same data centers their crawlers operate from. Every word I‚Äôve thrown into this illustrious publication‚Äîthe reading of which a total of five people have, at various times, expressed mild enjoyment‚Äîhas been both silently and explicitly declared fair game by the slop companies. The only positive thing I can egotistically hope to grasp about this development is that a distant and diluted abstraction of my words and thoughts could be subtly influencing the thoughts and decisions of people around the world‚Äîthe same way a pinch of salt would affect the flavor profile of a large vat at the soup factory, or like the breeze under the wings of chaos theory‚Äôs cute and frighteningly powerful butterfly mascot.",
