These are orbits of a special map. They were discovered by Barry Martin of Aston University in Birmingham. In 1986 they were popularized in the Scientific American by the well-known recreational mathematician Dewdney.\nThe hopalong map is iteratively applied to a point (x,y) and the resulting points are plotted. The hopalong map takes three parameters, a, b, and c. Interestingly, the final image does not really depend on the starting point, but is very sensitive to changes in the parameters."
