ASP.NET Core Identity is a membership system that adds login functionality to ASP.NET Core apps. As you might know, in ASP.NET Core when you’re using ASP.NET Core Identity - it is coming as a Razor Class Library. One of the issue is if a user is trying to register with an already existing email address - he or she need to complete the form and submit to view the validation error message. This is not a good experience for the user. In ASP.NET Core MVC there is an attribute - Remote - available to run validation in such scenarios. In Razor Page remote validation attribute is not available. Instead there a Page Remote attribute. In this article you will learn how to implement Page Remote attribute for an ASP.NET Core identity project."
