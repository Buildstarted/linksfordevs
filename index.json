Now, if you’re at all familiar with these languages, then\njust from reading that sentence you might have an inkling that I’m either a\ncrackpot or painfully naive. If you did, then I applaud your skepticism.\nNonetheless, I believe I have glimpsed a path to this seemingly impossible\nconfluence of properties, and in this series of blog posts I hope to share at\nleast a part of that vision with you."
