I honestly don't know if this build is actually an ad. I don't even remember how I became an 'Insider' in the first place. Did I fill out a form years ago or is MS giving these licences away like candy with a shiny button to get free-pass on Early-Access shenanigans? Of course I could just read the build documentation but my point is I shouldn't have to. They used to call these things alphas, betas, RCs, etc. for a reason. Windows 11 [/ VSC] 'Insiders' means nothing. And it's dumb. It's like calling it Windows VIP (which admitedly, sounds kinda cool - better that 'Insiders', for sure)."
