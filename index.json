    "Description": "Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer's time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers' heads. It's difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack \"code browsers\" that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we'll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes."

    "Description": "I recently realized that I have been wasting my time on a dumb effort for the last 35 years. It all started back in 1983. My game for the Atari, Eastern Front (1941), had been a big hit, and Dale Yocum of the Atari Program Exchange suggested that I release the source code for it. This was an exciting idea, as nobody had ever release source code for a commercial game before then, and I readily agreed. However, I insisted that the source code be thoroughly explained, so I spent some months writing up a long explanation of all the algorithms used in the game. The entire package came to some 150 pages. We charged a lot of money for it, so it didn’t sell many copies. Still, I hoped that the buyers would use the ideas in the package. I was disappointed, because only one game appeared using any of the ideas we published in the source code: Ghost Ship, by Kellyn Beeck. Perhaps somebody else used some of the ideas without my knowing, but I rather doubt it."

    "Description": "Batch normalization is a key component of most image classification models,\nbut it has many undesirable properties stemming from its dependence on the\nbatch size and interactions between examples. Although recent work has\nsucceeded in training deep ResNets without normalization layers, these models\ndo not match the test accuracies of the best batch-normalized networks, and are\noften unstable for large learning rates or strong data augmentations. In this\nwork, we develop an adaptive gradient clipping technique which overcomes these\ninstabilities, and design a significantly improved class of Normalizer-Free\nResNets. Our smaller models match the test accuracy of an EfficientNet-B7 on\nImageNet while being up to 8.7x faster to train, and our largest models attain\na new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 86.5%. In addition, Normalizer-Free\nmodels attain significantly better performance than their batch-normalized\ncounterparts when finetuning on ImageNet after large-scale pre-training on a\ndataset of 300 million labeled images, with our best models obtaining an\naccuracy of 89.2%.
