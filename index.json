However there is not any mechanism to protect subsequent component against spoofing. Indeed, if your subsequent component, let’s say an API, is exposed on Internet, anyone can forge a HTTP Forwarded header. If your API is always behind your proxy, it has to remove/replace the original Forwarded header. It becomes even more complex if you have multiple proxies.",
