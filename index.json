Texans expressed more worry about the surging pandemic and its effects than in June, and gave Governor Abbott the lowest job approval rating of his tenure in office. A majority ‚Äì 52% ‚Äì¬† said the state is headed in the wrong direction, the worst assessment of the direction of the state since the inception of this polling project in 2008."
