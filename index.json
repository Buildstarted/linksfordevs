    "Description": "Common wisdom tells you that many problems worth solving have already been solved for you (probably more than once), and that you should leverage this fact. In other words: don’t reinvent the wheel; stand on the shoulders of giants. I very often follow this rule of thumb. But last week, I broke that rule and wrote an F# implementation of the OSC (Open Sound Control) protocol1.                 Um, ackshually, it’s a content format, not a protocol… Yes, I know, dear reader, and they spell this out in [the OSC 1.1 spec][osc-1.1]. I called it that for sake of simplicity. Calling it a “content format” may be more correct, but I think “protocol” gives a better connotation in that opening paragraph. You may notice that I more correctly use the “content format” description later on. Whatever, go ahead and crucify me for that if you’re feeling particularly pedantic today. I’ll still love you. You—yes, you, beloved reader. ↩",
