Five years ago, I saw this thing as magical. Somehow, it was able to take my voice from across the room, convert it into a command, and do what I wanted it to do most of the time. But times have changed.Today, we have large language models which can write hundreds of lines of working code, understand voice with near-perfect accuracy, and actually generate audio waves instead of just using text-to-speech. 4 years of incredible, mind-blowing advancements ‚Äì&nbsp;and Alexa hasn‚Äôt changed a bit.Here is something that happened this morning:\"Alexa, play the previous song again\"\"Here is a song you recently played\"I don‚Äôt know how Alexa works under the hood. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs very complicated and not something that can be upgraded easily, but it‚Äôs down right embarrassing that in this day and age, Alexa can‚Äôt play the previous song about half the time I ask it to. It fails to turn on/off all the lights in my apartment maybe a third of the time. It randomly disconnects from my smart home devices. I‚Äôve completely given up on trying to program a scene into it.I know I‚Äôm complaining a lot, but come on. We deserve better.Please, Amazon, fix Alexa.",
