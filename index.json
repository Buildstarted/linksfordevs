    "Description": "TL;DR: LLMs have been traditionally regarded as sequential decoders, decoding one token after another. In this blog, we show pretrained LLMs can be easily taught to operate as efficient parallel decoders. We introduce Consistency Large Language Models (CLLMs), a new family of parallel decoders capable of reducing inference latency by efficiently decoding an $n$-token sequence per inference step. Our research shows this process – mimicking human cognitive process of forming complete sentences in mind before articulating word by word – can be effectively learned by simply finetuning pretrained LLMs.",

Originally “XboxAhoy”, I’ve been watching Brown’s stuff since 2012 after finding his Call of Duty: Black Ops II weapon guide series. His videos were exceptionally well produced, especially relative to 2012 YouTube quality, and he’s only improved over time.

The manner and rationale of the suspension reveals corruption of the promised objective process, and the fact of the suspension deprives the project of valuable contributions. Everyone should accept that the NixOS Foundation Board has made its decision that certain positions are not up for discussion, and either engage on their (actual, not promised) terms or part ways.",
