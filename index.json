    "Description": "holy fucking shit!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI've had this in my drafts to finish writing up for a few weeks but today I made another discovery that has pushed me to finally write it up lol.\n\nMy PC had a few hiccups over the past couple of years. Nothing so serious that I was truly concerned (at first) but, annoyances, to be sure. (\"PC? Weren't you talking about a TV??\" you might be thinking to yourself. Yes. I'll get there. Oh, will I ever get there.)\n\nFor a long time, the most serious hiccup with my PC was being unable to open Display Settings on my PC. I had to use Nvidia control panel to make adjustments. Whatever. Didn't affect my ability to work or anything. I had just updated to Windows 11 so I thought maybe something went wrong in the update. So I did another install (which meant I had to re-install a ton of music plugin stuff on my computer which takes ages given all the stuff I use.)\n\nThe fresh install still didn't fix it. So I simply ignored it for the better part of 2 years.\n\nOver time, so slowly I didn't really clock them as being related, other things started to fail.\n\nI have a Komplete Kontrol S88 midi Keyboard that interfaces with Kontakt and Komplete Kontrol in my DAW. I can use the keyboard to adjust settings or select instruments without having to look at my computer screen. At some point last year this stopped working. I could still use it to input midi, and I was afraid I'd have to do a fresh install of all the Native Instruments stuff I use, so I kept putting off trying to fix it until I had less going on with work. It worked, just not as well as it should!\n\nThen, Task manager started to hang in weird ways. It wouldn't close unless I forced it closed with ProcExp. Whatever! Computers are weird!\n\nI had trouble getting video capture cards to connect when I considered streaming Splatoon. Whatever! I'm not a streamer, I should probably use that energy on something else.\n\nBut then, in March, I had some things fail that, turns out, are pretty necessary to using the computer.\n\nI was trying to get remote desktop to work on my tablet so I could work in the living room closer to my cat, Grendel, who was still very much in mourning for his best friend (<3 Guts). Grendel is at his happiest when he's napping on the couch next to a human. So I thought, hey, I could do some stuff in remote desktop mode! It wasn't something I used very often because it doesn't play super nice with audio, it'd been probably over a year since I last used it, but I knew it had worked and had been easy to set up.\n\nWell. It refused to connect despite appearing as an option on my tablet. And as I was trying to troubleshoot this problem...\n\nMy task bars on my PC disappeared! If I moused over the spot they should have been I got the loading circle. And my monitors would jitter!\n\nSystem settings were nowhere to be found. To navigate I had to open Task Manager (which if you recall was already acting strange and sluggish for the past year) in order to open the command panel, which I'd then use to launch programs. Or, attempt to. If I tried to open the system settings, my PC spat out \"Uhhh what's \"Settings\"? We ain't got settings\" (in command I got \"C:\\Windows\\System32>start ms-settings: Access is denied.\" despite being in admin mode)\n\nSO I started to panic a wee bit. It's not a great time for me to possibly need a new PC! Plus, it works great when it works.\n\nI manually backed up everything important from my main PC drive (as I could not access the windows backup program because it lived in settings!!!!!!!!) and downloaded the Windows 11 installer to a drive in case I needed to completely wipe my computer and start fresh.\n\nIn a last ditch effort, I tried updating my Nvidia GeForce graphics driver and restarted.\n\nLo and behold, my taskbars came back and I could access settings again! Huzzah!\n\nThis lasted for 6 days. And then the taskbars disappeared AGAIN along with Settings.\n\nAt least by now I'd become somewhat comfortable using command to get around, so I was less panicked than I was in round 1. I at least knew the computer wouldn't crash and delete all my shit suddenly (plus I had my backups that were up-to-date).\n\nI asked my friends if they'd ever heard of anything like this, and Cohost's own @vogon helped me poke around some additional graphics driver stuff in case updating to the new Nvidia program that's in beta would solve my issue. This felt super promising when I went into safe mode and saw taskbars. So, I did the update, and, as before, when I updated, the taskbars came back! But there were gone again almost immediately. My screen literally started flickering and they vanished. It was so fucking bizarre.\n\nI turned to google once more, hoping that somehow, as useless as google is these days, maybe I'd find what I needed to fix my damn computer!\n\nSomehow, against all odds, I found it. I happened to use the exact right string in my search to pull up some reddit threads. The first one didn't have anything useful, but a few results down I spotted \"no taskbar and task manager freezes\" holy moly!!!\n\nAt first glance however, there wasn't anything useful. But then I spotted some collapsed comments at the bottom of the thread. I knew more than likely they just had comments like \"sucks bro\" or \"this is why i use linux :/\" But I expanded them and inside was a link to a Microsoft forum post. I kept my expectations in check and clicked on the link. What I saw had my nearly vibrating in my seat.\n\nScreenshots showing the path from my google search to reddit to a minimized comment that contained a link to a microsoft forum post with the solution to my several year long problem - caused by our TV [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/d9f5719e-fe05-4247-9c27-39c3381f0648/screenshot%20collage.png?width=675&#x26;auto=webp&#x26;dpr=1]\n\nThis was the solution. [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1339707/help-with-figuring-out-what-is-causing-waitchain-d]\n\nNarayan B\nNov 16, 2023, 12:20 AM\n\nSo I finally solved it!\n\nSource of the problem: an Android TV (HiSense model) connected to my network. Yes. A TV caused this issue.\n\nHISENSE? LIKE THE SAME BRAND OF TV I HAVE HAD SINCE 2020???\n\nI followed the instructions. I deleted keys generated by our TV for 5 straight minutes. 5 Minutes of like 200BPM clicking. I restarted. Everything worked again. I laughed so hard I cried. I felt like I'd solved a murder. The main suspect was the PC but the culprit was the TV in the other room. And he almost got away with it!!! If I had spent a few days carrying out a clean install and re-installing all my work stuff, my problem would have come back. If I had taken the PC out back and shot it and replaced it with a fancy new computer, the problem would have come back.\n\nBecause the problem was never the PC. The Problem was my Hisense TV in the next room.\n\nOnce I carried this out, I was able to open display settings for the first time (outside of safe mode) in 2 years. When I deleted the keys, my Task Manager started behaving normally again. I turned around and saw that my keyboard was once again displaying the VST controls on its screen. The fancy midi keyboard was back at full functionality. I was able to connect my CRT as a display again using the HDMI -> RCA converters I'd assumed had stopped working (nope! they still worked, they always worked!)\n\nWhich brings me to today. Almost a month later everything still works. So, I decided to see if remote desktop would magically work again. The answer is: Yes. Yes, in fact, my TV was the reason my remote desktop connection had failed the month before.\n\nSo here I am, sitting on my couch with my tablet and bluetooth keeb and mouse, writing this post in remote desktop mode so I could attach screenshots of this saga to my post without sitting at my PC. Grendel is snoring beside me as I write.\n\nAs a treat for reading this far, please enjoy two screenshots of my friends reacting to the solution of my great mystery.\n\nfriends reacting in discord, the overall sentiment: what the fuck that is so cursed [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/a23624ba-f7bc-4b5b-aa53-68b1e16bfd2e/cursed%20TV%20PC%20reactions.png] friends reacting in discord, the overall sentiment: what the fuck that is so cursed [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/b9d4234d-4a60-4bb0-b2a9-92b898e75fba/cursed%20TV%20PC%20reactions2.png]\n\nadding: the TV in question, in case you're curious: Hisense 50Q8G- 50\" Smart 4K ULED™ Android TV with Quantum Dot Technology (Canada Model)",

    "Description": "I host a few small low-traffic websites for local interests. I do this for free\n- and some of them are for a friend who died last year but didn’t want all his\nwork to vanish. They don’t get so many views, so I was surprised when I happened\nto glance at munin and saw my bandwidth usage had gone up a lot. I spent a\ncouple of hours working to solve this and did everything wrong. But it was a\nuseful learning experience and I thought it might be worth sharing in case\nanyone else encounters similar. My setup is: Cloudflare DNS -> Cloudflare Tunnel\n(Because my residential isp uses CGNAT) -> Haproxy (I like Haproxy and amongst\nother things, alerts me when a site is down) -> Separate Docker containers for\neach website. On a Debian server living in my garage. From Haproxy’s stats page,\nI was able to see which website was gathering attention. It’s one running PhpBB\nfor a little forum. Tailing apache’s logs in that container quickly identified\nthe pattern and made it easy to see what was happening. It was seeing a lot of\n404 errors for URLs all coming from the same user-agent “claudebot”. I know what\nyou’re thinking - it’s an exploit scanning bot, but a closer look showed it was\ntrying to fetch normal forum posts, some which had been deleted months\npreviously, and also robots.txt. That site doesn’t have a robots.txt so that was\nfailing. What was weird is that the it was requesting at a rate of up to 20 urls\na second, from multiple AWS IPs - and every other request was for robots.txt.\nYou’d think it would take the hint after a million times of asking. Googling\nthat UA turns up that other PhpBB users have encountered this quite recently -\nit seems to be fascinated by web forums and absolutely hammers them with the\nsame behaviour I found. So - clearly a broken and stupid bot, right? Rather than\nbeing specifically malicious. I think so, but I host these sites on a rural\nconsumer line and it was affecting both system load and bandwidth. What I did\nwrong: 1. In docker, I tried quite a few things to block the user agent, the\ncountry (US based AWS, and this is a UK regional site), various IPs. It took me\nfar too long to realise why my changes to .htaccess were failing - the phpbb\ndocker image I use mounts the root directory to the website internally, ignoring\nmy mounted vol. (My own fault, it was too long since I set it up to remember\nonly certain sub-dirs were mounted in)\n2. Figuring that out, I shelled into the container and edited that .htaccess,\nbut wouldn’t have survived restarting/rebuilding the container so wasn’t a real\nsolution. Whilst I was in there, I created a robots.txt file. Not surprisingly,\nclaudebot doesn’t actually honour whats in there, and still continues to request\nit ten times a second. 3. Thinking there must be another way, I switched to\nHaproxy. This was much easier - the documentation is very good. And it actually\nworked - blocking by Useragent (and yep, I’m lucky this wasn’t changing) worked\nperfectly. I then had to leave for a while and the graphs show it’s working.\n(Yellow above the line is requests coming into haproxy, below the line are\nresponses).\n[https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/2bc99426-0356-4010-a0e5-f7b8dbfeb14a.png] Great -\nexcept I’m still seeing half of the traffic, and that’s affecting my latency.\n(Some of you might doubt this, and I can tell you that you’re spoiled by an\nexcess of bandwidth…) 4. That’s when the penny dropped and the obvious occured.\nI use cloudflare, so use their firewall, right? No excuses - I should have gone\nthere first. In fact, I did, but I got distracted by the many options and\nfocused on their bot fighting tools, which didn’t work for me. (This bot is\nsomehow getting through the captcha challenge even when bot fight mode is\nenabled) But, their firewall has an option for user agent. The actual fix was\nsimply to add this in WAF for that domain.\n[https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/98041b82-de04-4cdc-bfb1-05f4e5656903.png] And\nvoila - no more traffic through the tunnel for this very rude and stupid bot.\nAfter 24 hours, Cloudflare has blocked almost a quarter of a million requests by\nclaudebot to my little phpbb forum which barely gets a single post every three\nmonths.\n[https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/f3170d6c-fec1-4820-9fbb-b54b14db46f8.png] Moral\nfor myself: Stand back and think for a minute before rushing in and trying to\nfix something in the wrong way. I’ve also taken this as an opportunity to\nimprove haproxy’s rate limiting internally. Like most website hosts, most of my\ntraffic is outbound, and slowing things down when it gets busy really does help.\nThis obviously isn’t a perfect solution - all claudebot has to do is change its\nUA, and by coming from AWS it’s pretty hard to block otherwise. One hopes it\nisn’t truly malicious. It would be quite a lot more work to integrate Fail2ban\nfor more bots, but it might yet come to that. Also, if you write any kind of web\nbot, please consider that not everyone who hosts a website has a lot of\nbandwidth, and at least have enough pride to write software good enough to not\nkeep doing the same thing every second. And, y’know, keep an eye on what your\nstuff is doing out on the internet - not least for your own benefit. Hopefully\nAWS really shaft claudebot’s owners with some big bandwidth charges… EDIT: It\ncame back the next day with a new UA, and an email address linking it to\nanthropic.com [http://anthropic.com] - the Claude3 AI bot, so it looks like a\nparticularly badly written scraper for AI learning.",
