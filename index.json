    "Description": "While deep learning has enabled tremendous progress on text and image\ndatasets, its superiority on tabular data is not clear. We contribute extensive\nbenchmarks of standard and novel deep learning methods as well as tree-based\nmodels such as XGBoost and Random Forests, across a large number of datasets\nand hyperparameter combinations. We define a standard set of 45 datasets from\nvaried domains with clear characteristics of tabular data and a benchmarking\nmethodology accounting for both fitting models and finding good\nhyperparameters. Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on\nmedium-sized data ($\\sim$10K samples) even without accounting for their\nsuperior speed. To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical investigation\ninto the differing inductive biases of tree-based models and Neural Networks\n(NNs). This leads to a series of challenges which should guide researchers\naiming to build tabular-specific NNs: 1. be robust to uninformative features,\n2. preserve the orientation of the data, and 3. be able to easily learn\nirregular functions. To stimulate research on tabular architectures, we\ncontribute a standard benchmark and raw data for baselines: every point of a 20\n000 compute hours hyperparameter search for each learner.",
