She was showing a demo of Web API with swagger support. So thought I will implement the same. But it was not working for me. I was getting a lot of errors - both compile time and runtime. Then I looked into the ASP.NET Core source code and found one extension method which was not available in the runtime I was using. So I upgraded the version and installed the - 6.0.100-preview.6.21357.52 version and it started working. If you’re not using this version the code in this blog post will not work."
