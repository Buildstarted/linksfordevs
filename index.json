The material exhibits the Ohmic metal\ncharacteristic of Pb(6s1) above its superconducting critical temperature,\n$T_c$, and the levitation phenomenon as Meissner effect of a superconductor at\nroom temperature and atmospheric pressure below $T_c$. A LK-99 sample shows\n$T_c$ above 126.85$^\trc$C (400 K). We analyze that the possibility of\nroom-temperature superconductivity in this material is attributed to two\nfactors: the first being the volume contraction resulting from an\ninsulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and the second\nbeing on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by the structural\ndeformation in the one-dimensional(D) chain (Pb2-O$_{1/2}$-Pb2 along the\nc-axis) structure owing to superconducting condensation at $T_c$.

Here I perform density functional theory calculations on\nCu-substituted lead phosphate apatite, identifying correlated isolated flat\nbands at the Fermi level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in\nalready established families of superconductors. I elucidate the origins of\nthese isolated bands as arising from a structural distortion induced by the Cu\nions and a chiral charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs. These results\nsuggest that a minimal two-band model can encompass much of the low-energy\nphysics in this system.

To verify this exciting claim, we have\nsuccessfully synthesized Pb2SO5, Cu3P, and finally the modified lead-apatite\nPb10-xCux(PO4)6O. Detailed electrical transport and magnetic properties of\nthese compounds were systematically analyzed. It turns out that Pb2SO5 is a\nhighly insulating diamagnet with a room-temperature resistivity of ~7.18x10^9\nOhm.cm and Cu3P is a paramagnetic metal with a room-temperature resistivity of\n~5.22x10^-4 Ohm.cm. In contrast to the claimed superconductivity, the resulting\nPb10-xCux(PO4)6O compound sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P exhibits\nsemiconductor-like transport behavior with a large room-temperature resistivity\nof ~1.94x10^4 Ohm.cm although our compound shows greatly consistent x-ray\ndiffraction spectrum with the previously reported structure data. In addition,\nwhen a pressed Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O pellet is located on top of a commercial\nNd2Fe14B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic\nlevitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of a\nroom-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more careful\nre-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties.",
