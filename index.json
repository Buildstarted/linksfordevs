Про це повідомив президент Володимир Зеленський під час виступу перед Генеральною асамблеєю Організації американських держав (ОАД). Нещодавно російська окупаційна адміністрація в Херсоні оголосила про так звану \"евакуацію\" мешканців регіону до РФ та окупованого Росією Криму, що насправді є нічим іншим, як продовженням тієї ж політики примусових депортацій та незаконного позбавлення волі, які раніше були застосовані російськими окупантами в Криму та на сході України.\n____________________________________\nMore than 1.6 million Ukrainians were forcibly deported to Russia. It was reported by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a speech at the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS). Recently, the Russian occupation administration in Kherson announced the so-called \"evacuation\" of the residents of the region to the Russian Federation and Russian-occupied Crimea, which in fact is nothing more than a continuation of the same policy of forced deportations and illegal deprivation of liberty, which was previously applied by the Russian occupiers in Crimea and on in the east of Ukraine.\n_________\nПідписуйтесь на @bykvu\n\n#новини #новиниукраїни #війна #росіяагресор #україна #StayWithUkraine #Ukraine #StayTogether #StandTogether #StopRussia #StopWar",
