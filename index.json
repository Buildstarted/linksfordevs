    "Description": "FILED   UNDER   SEAL   May   31,   2023   Via   CM/ECF   Re:   Klein   v.   Meta   Platforms,   Inc.,   No.   3:20-cv-08570-JD   (N.D.   Cal.)   Dear   Judge   Donato:   Advertiser   Plaintiffs   (“Advertisers”)   respectfully   request   that   the   Court   find   that   a   prima   facie   case   exists   under   the   crime-fraud   exception   with   respect   to   certain   communications   currently   being   withheld   by   Defendant   Meta   Platforms,   Inc.   (“Facebook”)   as   attorney-client   privileged.   The   communications   at   issue   relate   to   Facebook’s   so-called   In-App   Action   Panel   (“IAAP”)   program,   which   existed   between   June   2016   and   approximately   May   2019.   The   IAAP   program,   launched   at   the   request   of   Mark   Zuckerberg,   used   a   cyberattack   method   called   “SSL   man-in-the-middle”   to   intercept   and   decrypt   Snapchat’s—and   later   YouTube’s   and   Amazon’s—SSL-protected   analytics   traffic   to   inform   Facebook’s   competitive   decisionmaking.   As   described   below,   Facebook’s   IAAP   program   conduct   was   not   merely   anticompetitive,   but   criminal—the   program   violated   18   U.S.C.   §   2511(a)   and   (d),   the   so-called   “Wiretap   Act,”   with   no   applicable   exception.   Facebook’s   attorneys   were   pervasively   involved   in   the   design,   execution,   and   expansion   of   this   program.   On   May   15,   2023,   Advertisers   sent   Facebook   a   nineteen-page   single-spaced   letter   providing   screenshots,   quotations   from   documents,   and   evidentiary   citations   setting   forth   the   company’s   applicable   conduct;   analyzing   that   conduct   under   18   U.S.C.   §   2511,   et   seq.   and   under   the   Ninth   Circuit’s   crime-fraud   test,   see   In   re   Grand   Jury   Investigation,   810   F.3d   1110,   1113   (9th   Cir.   2016);   and   seeking   a   prompt   meet-and-confer.1   Over   the   next   two   weeks,   Advertisers   sent   additional   letters   and   emails.   On   May   31,   the   parties   met   and   conferred   and   reached   impasse.   I.   Facebook’s   IAAP   Program   Targets   Competition   By   Wiretapping   Competitors   On   June   9,   2016,   Mark   Zuckerberg   emailed   three   of   the   company’s   top   executives   a   message   titled   “Snapchat   analytics.”   PX   2255   (PALM-016564834)   at   3.   According   to   Zuckerberg:   Whenever   someone   asks   a   question   about   Snapchat,   the   answer   is   usually   that   because   their   traffic   is   encrypted   we   have   no   analytics   about   them.   .   .   .   Given   how   quickly   they’re   growing,   it   seems   important   to   figure   out   a   new   way   to   get   reliable   analytics   about   them.   Perhaps   we   need   to   do   panels   or   write   custom   software.   You   should   figure   out   how   to   do   this.   Id.   Javier   Olivan,   now   Facebook’s   COO,   promptly   replied,   “fully   agree[ing]   that   this   was   one   of   the   most   important   market   analysis   questions   we   need   to   answer.”   Id.   However,   Olivan   “ha[d]   been   looking   into   this   with   the   onavo   team”   and   the   technology   to   look   inside   Snapchat’s   SSL-   protected   analytics   traffic   “[wa]s   really   complicated,”   likely   “requir[ing]   legal   approval.”   Id.   Five   minutes   later,   Olivan   forwarded   Zuckerberg’s   email   to   Facebook’s   Onavo   team,   asking   for   “out   of   the   box   thinking”   on   a   task   that   “is   really   important.”   Id.   at   2.   Olivan   suggested   potentially   paying   users   to   “let   us   install   a   really   heavy   piece   of   software   (that   could   even   do   man   in   the   middle,   etc.).”   Id.   Later   that   morning,   Onavo   founder   Guy   Rosen   replied:   “we   are   going   to   figure   out   a   plan   for   a   lockdown   effort   during   June   to   bring   a   step   change   to   our   Snapchat   visibility.   This   is   an   opportunity   for   our   team   to   shine.”   Id.   at   1.   Two   days   later,   Olivan   forwarded   the   whole   email   thread   to   then-General   Counsel   Colin   Stretch,   saying   “[w]e   should   move   as   fast   as   possible   on   this   (budget   will   not   be   an   issue   assuming   Colin   greenlights   this   type   of   research   on   the   thread   @   Colin   1   Advertisers   stand   ready   to   provide   full   briefing,   exhibits,   and/or   Advertisers’   letters   to   Facebook   at   the   Court’s   request.

While admittedly most juicy and interesting part is the obfuscated binary with the backdoor, the part that caught my attention – and what this blogpost is about – is the initial part in bash and the simple-but-clever obfuscation methods used there. Note that this isn't a full description of what the bash stages do, but rather a write down of how each stage is obfuscated and extracted.",
