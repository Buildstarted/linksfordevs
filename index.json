Rather than failing wouldn't it be nice to let the user know and optionally allow saving with elevated permissions? In this post I describe the workflow and implementation on how to do just that.",

    "Description": "The game of Othello is one of the world's most complex and popular games that\nhas yet to be computationally solved. Othello has roughly ten octodecillion (10\nto the 58th power) possible game records and ten octillion (10 to the 28th\npower) possible game position. The challenge of solving Othello, determining\nthe outcome of a game with no mistake made by either player, has long been a\ngrand challenge in computer science. This paper announces a significant\nmilestone: Othello is now solved, computationally proved that perfect play by\nboth players lead to a draw. Strong Othello software has long been built using\nheuristically designed search techniques. Solving a game provides the solution\nwhich enables software to play the game perfectly.",
