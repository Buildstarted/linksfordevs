After making a ribbon map of the Suwannee River, multiple people (jokingly?) suggested that I look into receipt printers when I explained how I needed to print the Suwannee map out in four sections. And the more I thought about it, the more that the idea of working within such absurd limitations sounded fun. So I created this map, and I’ll touch on all the things you might want to consider if you, too, want to print a map on thermal receipt printer.

    "Description": "Recent research, such as BitNet, is paving the way for a new era of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant, namely BitNet b1.58, in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is ternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, while being significantly more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption. More profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective. Furthermore, it enables a new computation paradigm and opens the door for designing specific hardware optimized for 1-bit LLMs.",

    "Description": "The other day I happened upon a post by Chris Barrick detailing how to encode a tic-tac-toe game state in 15 bits, itself a response to an earlier post by Alejandra González detailing how to encode a tic-tac-toe state in 18 bits. In their posts, Chris and Alejandra mention 10 bits as the absolute minimum, since there are only 765 possible game states. This number, however, takes mirroring and rotations into account1, while Chris’ and Alejandra’s solutions do not. If you include mirrorings and rotations, the number of states jumps to 5477 that gives us a theoretical minimum of \\(\\left\\lceil{\\log_2{5477}}\\right\\rceil=\\left\\lceil{12.419...}\\right\\rceil=13\\) bits. For physicists, the difference between 13 and 15 might look negligible, but hey, consuming 15% more space is no joke. The 765 figure considers the following two boards (and a few others) as the same state: ↩",

After a quick search, I reviewed four solutions: DeepL Write, Hemingway, LanguageTool, and Grammarly. Another alternative I didn't explore was running an LLM locally or on a server because of the hardware requirements. Let's explore what problems I'm trying to solve, the level of privacy and security I can expect from these tools, and how well they perform according to my subjective gut feeling.",
