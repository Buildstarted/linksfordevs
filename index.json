As far as I can tell only code mere mortals can use in a general way is to route over it is to use socat vsock support\n.\nSeems that libkrun implements a slirp-style network forwarded on kvm host side and I have no clue what they do inside kvm. If you figure that out, ping me on my socials.\nUpdate: More info in twitter discussion\n.\nEmbedding JITTED WASM in libkrun\nHN completely ignored the story\n on how to marry above with WASM.\nWhy?\n\nBut there’s an scenario where Virtualization is not optional, and that’s when you want to protect the workload with Confidential Computing technologies such as SEV or TDX, as both of them are built on top of the existing Virtualization capabilities provided by the hardware.\n\nMetallize\nI once wrote a tool to make it easy to generate machine images using docker. I posted a re-implementation of that here: https://github.com/tarasglek/metallize\n\nI need to make a really high performance networking setup to drive multiple 100G nics at max perf which required network namespaces, carefully setup subnets, cpu pinning, a custom fio, etc. Docker was the quickest way to iterate on those.\nApparently there is a way to do something similar using podman/buildah.\nConclusion\nThis set of technologies clicked together in my head from that random github recommendation.
