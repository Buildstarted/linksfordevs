    "Description": "Last time, we learned that the naïve implementation of cold-start coroutines is susceptible to stack build-up. What we want is for await_suspend to return false if the coroutine completed synchronously. This is tricky because that reintroduces a race condition where the coroutine runs asynchronously and completes at the same time we try to transition from synchronous to asynchronous behavior in the awaiter."
