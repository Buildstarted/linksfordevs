    "Description": "This week, Jeffrey welcomes Bryan Costanich, Founder of Wilderness Labs and former VP of Xamarin. Bryan talks with us about the state of .NET, the advantages and disadvantages of moving into the embedded space, and how embedded computing is the new revolution. Bryan is also on a mission to leave the world a little better than he found it. &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [2:04] Bryan talks about his background and time at Xamarin, Microsoft, and the origins of Wilderness Labs. [4:16] What is the state of .NET? In the embedded system world, what are the realistic options and future in 2022 and beyond? [8:04] What are both the advantages and disadvantages of moving into the embedded space? [11:04] Bryan discusses how a lot of the advantages of microcontrollers moving to embedded are historical in the sense that you are developing for embedded devices that havenâ€™t changed a lot since the â€™70s and â€™80s. [12:30] Seventy percent of all security bugs arenâ€™t even an issue in .NET. [15:05] Bryan talks about his intent to make it easier for people to use and to create the ideal experience through Xamarin. [15:41] The next phase of humankindâ€™s technological computing journey is embedded computing. This is the new revolution. [16:45] There are three parts of the IoT market: consumer, commercial, and industrial. [20:23] Bryan talks about how Xamarinâ€™s main products are compromised and where they land on the spectrum. He discusses Azure Sphere and Raspberry Pi. [26:29] What exactly does Bryan develop with? He describes his setup. [31:09] Some fun smart chicken coop talk! [34:42] How does crash reporting work in Xamarin? [36:55] In the core compute module, how does one build the enclosure that it snaps into? [39:11] What is the most common product mix? [39:30] When will Xamarinâ€™s products be released? &nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  â€” New video podcast!

    "Description": "I borrowed a friendâ€™s Tesla 3 yesterday. About 5 minutes into the ride, the windshield started fogging up. I couldnâ€™t find the defroster on the large control screen Teslas are so famous for. In desperation, I tapped the CAR icon but that took me to the settings screen which ended up being a dead end. Frustrated, I opened the side windows to clear the windshield. While pushing every button on the steering wheel, I accidentally discovered the voice control and was finally able to get the defroster working. It was such an odd experience I tweeted about how frustrating it was:",
