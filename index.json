Thankfully, Opus and o3 (I'll just refer to them as AI; all queries were sent to one or both, and distinguishing between them is not important to the story) massively helped me, and, I believe, essentially saved me from it becoming a permanent issue. Eventually, I was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease called MOG-associated disease (MOGAD). I'm not sure what this looks like going forward. But, here, I'd like to tell my story.

These were the days of the .com boom and I went to big expos in London where they showered you with freebies and IBM competed with SuSE and Red Hat for the biggest stall.  IBM said that Linux had made it on the server and now was going to take over the desktop so I realised that working with KDE would be a good idea.  And as a novice coder it was very perfect for learning Qt and how open development worked and I loved the free software ideals.  Going to the pre-Akademy conference (it was called Kastle then) in Nove Hrady was a great intro to the community in person and in some ways I learnt more about software development in a week there then my years at uni.",
