All the existing explanations I've found are deep in the weeds of how Webmentions work on a technical level, which isn't a very helpful place to start for people who just want to post.\n\nI want to fill that gap with this post, and give people who don't know the ins and outs of HTTP a working understanding of what Webmentions do and how to get them up and running for your site. To that end:\n\nWebmentions are a way to let a website know that you linked to it.\n\nThat's it! At it's core, it's just that simple. If‚Ä¶",

Awesome!\n\nBut have you found in your applications that you're writing UTC DateTimes to databases and then reading those DateTimes back?\n\nIf you're not careful, you'll lose the implicit UTC time zone information.
