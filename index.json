So earlier in 2022, I had just started diving into the world of low level engineering. Fascinated by all these talks made by engineers who had done crazy things in the CS world, I could not wait to get my hands dirty. At the time I was building Remixify, which did not really do so well, because there was zero promo for it and just when I was about to release it, Heroku took away the free tier and I said flip it. It’s rotting on my GitHub somewhere at the moment. At this point, I was tired of building Remixify, I felt it was not stimulating enough, at the time. Or I was just bored, cause I asked myself, why would anyone want remixed versions of songs on their Spotify playlists in the first place? Maybe a handful, but was not encouraging enough to continue. I tweeted on my account for project ideas, and a friend of mine, Ahornam, sent me a link where someone was trying to build something similar to sqlite, with a well laid out approach and everything. It was written in C, and I barely know C, so I set out to build something similar in Go. I can’t even lie, it was a fun experience. I encountered so many problems when I was trying to port the solution to Go, and also trying to understand what exactly was going on in the tutorial.",
