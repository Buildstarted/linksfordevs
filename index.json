I ran a mastodon instance for a few years but did not use it much: I’m a developer and not much of a microblogger (reading or writing).

But when https://joinmobilizon.org/ was announced I thought it made a lot of sense to organize events in a federated way: smart move. And all along I thought I should read about fediverse but I still have no idea what it means (really)."

I’ve taken a step back on my leadership responsibilities now, so I can focus more on writing code."
