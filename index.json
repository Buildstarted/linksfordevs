In fact, I am moved to say that if you seriously wish to learn, for example, how to cut a better dovetail, the most efficient way to improve yourself is to attempt to teach someone else how to do it. The great thing about teaching is that you are quickly forced to confront a lot of things that you otherwise might easily ignore, avoid or simply be unaware of.",

Klein and Thompson propose a renaissance of our public institutions- an invigorated era where government “gets out of the way” of itself and executes on projects only it can do.",
