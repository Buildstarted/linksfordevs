Well, I know I did and it was a time when I kept myself focused by playing some logic games in the background. You know logic games like Minesweeper, simple games that once you learn you can solve absentmindedly. One game I kept thinking about over and over is Flip(which is an implementation of “Lights Out”). Computers solve this game by just solving a system of linear equations, but I wanted to find a method that 5 am me could absentmindedly use. Well, I didn’t find it but I found a way to solve that specific system of equations with much fewer operations. And that different way of solving it is the topic of this blog post.",

So I thought about a port expander... But what about using a second RP2350 as a port expander?",
