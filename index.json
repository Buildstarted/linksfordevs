In this case our query is online tokenizer Add spaces between the tokens from the tokenizer output for your new query: online tokenizer → online token izer Potentially pull up new and previously unseen search results online tokenizer DuckDuckGo Original query results: Tokenized query results: Some of the result differences: I intend to study this more in depth eventually, if you want you can find my progress here: github.",

Where Harari spins a neat story about European exploration driven by academic curiosity and enlightenment values, Frankopan provides the messy, complicated, properly researched truth: Columbus was a religious zealot seeking the Great Khan to fight a holy war.\n",
