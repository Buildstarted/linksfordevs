    "Description": "This article will discuss about implementing Page Remote validation in ASP.NET Core Identity. ASP.NET Core Identity is a membership system that adds login functionality to ASP.NET Core apps. As you might know, in ASP.NET Core when you’re using ASP.NET Core Identity - it is coming as a Razor Class Library. One of the issue is if a user is trying to register with an already existing email address - he or she need to complete the form and submit to view the validation error message. This is not a good experience for the user. In ASP.NET Core MVC there is an attribute - Remote - available to run validation in such scenarios. In Razor Page remote validation attribute is not available. Instead there a Page Remote attribute. In this article you will learn how to implement Page Remote attribute for an ASP.NET Core identity project."

Unfortunately, the brain activity that kept the human species alive for millions of years is the same brain activity that keeps us from achieving equality today. Author, speaker and CEO, Valerie Alexander, explains how the human brain instinctively reacts when encountering the unexpected, like saber-toothed tigers or female tech execs, and proposes that if we have the courage to examine our own behavior when faced with the unfamiliar, we can take control of our expectations, and by doing so, change the world."
