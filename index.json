This paper presents a new class of attack against certain cryptographic protocols that are based on low-entropy secrets (e.g., passwords). It’s a way to dramatically speed up guessing attacks – for example, in some cases the attack allows the attacker to binary-search over a dictionary of passwords instead of trying them one-by-one. This type of attack seems likely to become a classic because it applies to some well-known encryption schemes and many different applications."
