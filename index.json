    "Description": "One of my papers got declined today by the journal I submitted it to, with a polite letter saying that while they found the paper interesting, it was not a good fit for the journal.  In truth, I largely agreed with their conclusions, and the paper is now submitted to a different (and hopefully more appropriate) journal.\n\nRejection is actually a relatively common occurrence for me, happening once or twice a year on average.  I occasionally mention this fact to my students and colleagues, who are sometimes surprised that my rejection rate is far from zero.  I have belatedly realized our profession is far more willing to announce successful accomplishments (such as having a paper accepted, or a result proved) than unsuccessful ones (such as a paper rejected, or a proof attempt not working), except when the failures are somehow controversial.  Because of this, a perception can be created that all of one's peers are achieving either success or controversy, with one's own personal career ending up becoming the only known source of examples of \"mundane\" failure.  I speculate that this may be a contributor to the \"impostor syndrome\" that is prevalent in this field (though, again, not widely disseminated, due to the aforementioned reporting bias, and perhaps also due to some stigma regarding the topic).  So I decided to report this (rather routine) rejection as a token gesture towards more accurate disclosure.   (1/2)",
