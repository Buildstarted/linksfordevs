    "Description": "This post is about improving EF Core performance with Compiled queries. From EF Core 2.0 onwards, EF Core supports compiled queries, which helps developers to compile the queries in advance and executed when application executes the query. By default EF Core automatically compiles and caches your queries using a hashed representation of the query expression - when the code runs the previously executed query, EF Core lookup the cache with the hash value and returns the compiled query from the cache. We can explicitly compile the query upfront and invoke the compiled query. To compile the query, EF Core exposes two extension methods in EF class - EF.CompileQuery() and EF.CompileAsyncQuery(). These methods helps us to create compiled queries and call them using a delegate.",
