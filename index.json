Senior architects\n                and CTOs from companies big and small are touring conferences and meetups to evangelize how awesome\n                their new internal development platform is.\n                The new mantra is, 'DevOps is dead; long live platform engineering.' What caused this\n                trend, and why is it so successful, at least in its catchiness? Most talks and introductions about\n                platform engineering base all of their arguments on the book Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton and\n                Manuel Pais, published in 2019. According to Book Authority[1], this\n                book is ranked among the 'Best Product Management Books of All Time.' and is widely used by organizations\n                worldwide to transform the way they work. By understanding and implementing these team topologies\n                effectively, the authors' premise is that organizations can foster collaboration, reduce complexity,\n                and accelerate innovation in their software delivery processes.",
