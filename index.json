    "Description": "Spaced repetition is not super widespread. It’s popular among med school students and language learners, but frequently people find the benefits outweighed by the costs, the friction too high, and they stop.\nI believe the following are the most pressing issues to solve for spaced repetition to allow for wider adoption:\n Card creation: Zero friction card creation Card creation: Good cards by default Card maintenance: Eject bad cards quickly Schedule flexibility: Allow people to study more Schedule flexibility: Allow people to study less Review friction: Bring the reviews to the users  If we solve these six issues, I think that could open up spaced repetition to a much wider audience.",

    "Description": "Let me begin this post by saying that I'm no genius, and I've peeked under the hood of a few other Markdown parsers, all of which with complexity that leaves me quite stunned. So when I set out to create my very own Markdown parser, I knew I had to figure out a simpler approach, and I think I did, even if it doesn't include a full feature-set of a mainstream Markdown parser (yet).",

I voluntarily ignored perniciously backdoored algorithms such as cryptographic primitives or obfuscated code because this is a whole different topic.",
