    "Description": "Can GPTs like ChatGPT-4 play legal moves and finish chess games? What is the actual Elo rating of GPTs? There have been some hypes, (subjective) assessment, and buzz lately from “GPT is capable of beating 99% of players?” to “GPT plays lots of illegal moves” to “here is a magic prompt with Magnus Carlsen in the headers”. There are more or less solid anecdotes here and there, with counter-examples showing impressive failures or magnified stories on how GPTs can play chess well. I’ve resisted for a long time, but I’ve decided to do it seriously! I have synthesized hundreds of games with different variants of GPT, different prompt strategies, against different chess engines (with various skills). This post is here to document the variability space of experiments I have explored so far… and the underlying insights and results. \n\nThe tldr; is that gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct operates around 1750 Elo and is capable of playing end-to-end legal moves, even with black pieces or when the game starts with strange openings. \nHowever, though there are “avoidable” errors, the issue of generating illegal moves is still present in 16% of the games. Furthermore, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo and more surprisingly ChatGPT-4, however, are much more brittle. Hence, we provide first solid evidence that training for chat makes GPT worse on a well-defined problem (chess). Please do not stop to the tldr; and read the entire blog posts: there are subtleties and findings worth discussing!\n\n",

    "Description": "This paper targets high-fidelity and real-time view\n            synthesis of dynamic 3D scenes at 4K resolution. Recently, some\n            methods on dynamic view synthesis have shown impressive rendering quality. However, their speed is still\n            limited when rendering high-resolution images. To overcome this problem, we propose 4K4D, a 4D point cloud representation that supports hardware\n            rasterization and enables unprecedented rendering speed. Our representation is built on a 4D feature grid so\n            that the points are naturally regularized and can be robustly optimized. In addition, we design a novel\n            hybrid appearance model that significantly boosts the rendering quality while preserving efficiency.\n            Moreover, we develop a differentiable depth peeling algorithm to effectively learn the proposed model from\n            RGB videos. Experiments show that our representation can be rendered at over 400 FPS on the DNA-Rendering\n            dataset at 1080p resolution and 80 FPS on the ENeRF-Outdoor dataset at 4K resolution using an RTX 4090 GPU,\n            which is 30×\times faster than previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art rendering quality.",
