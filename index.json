As engineers I find often we try to explain why or how Nix works but never show the end result. Many of the talks I’ve given start explaining “Nix developed as part of Eelco’s PhD thesis in 2003” and immediately eyes roll. Let’s do it different this time. Let’s learn Nix the fun way.",

All search-and-replace operations happen on this single, global tree.",
