    "Description": "Flash cartridges (= \"carts\") are commonly used to run Game Boy ROMs, such as homebrew games or dumped officially released games, on real hardware. Different kinds of flash carts with various features and performance characteristics have been available for a long time, but flash carts have in general the reputation of consuming a lot of power, greatly reducing the battery life of a Game Boy system, and possibly causing other additional problems. System stability might suffer, especially on Game Boy Pocket, and flash carts can also increase audible noise. Many of these problems have become more obvious in the recent years, since Game Boy modding is nowadays very popular and many modern mods, such as IPS screens, consume a lot of extra power. Some people claim that certain mods are simply incompatible with flash carts, and sometimes people say an extra regluator mod is needed in order to safely use flash carts. There is some truth to these claims, but unfortunately the fine details tend to matter and these kind of blanket statements can be misleading!"

The presence of this deal, let alone the magnitude, is rare for the podcast ecosystem, which is built on open principles i.e. all podcasts are available everywhere.

We focused mostly on composing formally-verified code. I want to talk a little more about the difficulties in composing specifications. This is half because it‚Äôs difficult for interesting reasons and half because it‚Äôs a common question from beginners.\nBeginners to formal specification expect specifications should be organized like programs: multiple independent modules that interact through public interfaces, where the modules don‚Äôt know about each others‚Äô private implementations."
