    "Description": "Overnight, Apple has turned its hundreds-of-million-device ecosystem into the\nworld's largest crowd-sourced location tracking network called offline finding\n(OF). OF leverages online finder devices to detect the presence of missing\noffline devices using Bluetooth and report an approximate location back to the\nowner via the Internet. While OF is not the first system of its kind, it is the\nfirst to commit to strong privacy goals. In particular, OF aims to ensure\nfinder anonymity, untrackability of owner devices, and confidentiality of\nlocation reports. This paper presents the first comprehensive security and\nprivacy analysis of OF. To this end, we recover the specifications of the\nclosed-source OF protocols by means of reverse engineering. We experimentally\nshow that unauthorized access to the location reports allows for accurate\ndevice tracking and retrieving a user's top locations with an error in the\norder of 10 meters in urban areas. While we find that OF's design achieves its\nprivacy goals, we discover two distinct design and implementation flaws that\ncan lead to a location correlation attack and unauthorized access to the\nlocation history of the past seven days, which could deanonymize users. Apple\nhas partially addressed the issues following our responsible disclosure.\nFinally, we make our research artifacts publicly available."

    "Description": "Artificial Life Environment (ALiEn) is a simulation program based on a specialized 2D physics and rendering engine in CUDA. Each simulated body has a graph-like structure of connected building blocks that can either be programmed or equipped with functions to act in the world (accelerators, sensors, weapons, constructors, etc.). Such internal processes are triggered by signals coming from circulating tokens. The bodies can be thought of as small machines or agents operating in a common environment."
