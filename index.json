Following the documentation‚Äôs claim that a session ‚Äúrepresents a single business transaction,‚Äù we tested RavenDB 6.0.2 and found surprising behavior even in healthy, single-node clusters. Transactions lose updates by default.

Alternatively, RavenDB may not have interactive transactions at all. This work was performed independently without compensation, and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy.",
