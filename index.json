While I don't have anything negative to say about Nadella's leadership in this post, this narrative underrates Ballmer's role in Microsoft's success. Not only did Microsoft's financials, revenue and profit, look great under Ballmer, Microsoft under Ballmer made deep, long-term bets that set up Microsoft for success in the decades after his reign. At the time, the bets were widely panned, indicating that they weren't necessarily obvious, but we can see in retrospect that the company made very strong bets despite the criticism at the time.",

Most communication actually happened over telephone, and no company was more present in that space than the Bell System. Unfortunately, the way they were so present was through exclusive supply contracts (with its subsidiary Western Electric) and a vast array of patents that it would refuse to license to competitors. So they got an antitrust suit aimed at them, which after seven years of litigation culminated in the 1956 consent decree. The Bell System was broken up, obliged to license all of its patents royalty-free, and barred from entering any industry other than telecommunications. So they made Unix.",

    "Description": "In this episode, I show off a custom laser-engraved acrylic license plate cover I modified with an ESP32 microcontroller to create dynamic lighting effects. You‚Äôll see how I integrated it with LEDs for colors, wipes, fades, and even a flame effect. We dive into the science behind linear fiber optics and total internal reflection, plus explore how the etched design channels the light just where it‚Äôs needed.\n\nFinally, we tackle the big question: is this legal for the road? We review both federal and state laws and examine the nuances that determine what‚Äôs street-legal.\n\nIf you enjoy tech, optics, or unique car mods, stick around for today‚Äôs deep dive in Dave‚Äôs Garage!\n\nFree Sample of my Book on the Spectrum: https://amzn.to/3zBinWM\n\nDave's Attic - Friday 4PM Podcast - https://www.youtube.com/@UCtb6a_CnmGbSns9G8W2Ny0w \n\nCustom LED License Plate Cover Vendor:  https://illum-industries.com/\nM5 Stick C Plus: https://m5stack.com/\nSK6812 Strips: https://amzn.to/48ueEaz\n\nTOMLOV Microscope: https://amzn.to/3BZSlxf\n(Currently offered at $239 after you check the coupon box, so don't miss that!)\n\nFollow me for updates!  \nTwitter:   @davepl1968 davepl1968\nFacebook: fb.com/davepl",
