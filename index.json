I've a screen cap below of the mentioned documents open in LibreOffice.\n\nYeah, for document conversion, LibreOffice rocks.

C# has been a top 10 player for more than 2 decades and now that it is catching up with the big 4 languages, it won the well-deserved award by being the language with the biggest uptick in one year (+1.43%). Runners up are Scratch (+0.83%) and Fortran (+0.64%). C# is eating market share from Java and is getting more and more popular in domains such as web application back ends and games (thanks to Unity). C# can be used free of charge and evolves in a steady pace, making the language more expressive every new release. C# is here to stay and might even surpass Java soon.",
