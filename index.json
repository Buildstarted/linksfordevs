That is, translate your data into points in a n-dimensional metric space and then do linear algebra to it. The point cloud metaphor applies most simply to numeric tabular data, but with a little creativity it readily extends to text, images, time-series and so on. In this post I’m going to tackle the KolektorSDD2 image dataset – a collection of normal and defective surfaces for some unnamed product – by using the point cloud metaphor to create a simple custom embedding and then exploiting it with elementary regression methods. I’m going to beat the results for the weakly supervised task outlined in the associated paper (Average Precision of 0.73) which requires the classification of images into normal or defective using just image level labels (i.e. without using pixel level defect information).",
