Until recently this question couldn’t be given a satsfactory answer because no other planetery systems were known. Astronomers’ theories of things like planet formation tended to be overfitted to the Solar System simply because there wasn’t enough data to come up with much else. But since the mid-2000s, several thousand exoplanets have been discovered, and many of these belong to one of more than 800 known multiplanetary systems. With these discoveries it is now possible to consider the Solar System (that is, the multiplanetary system based on the star Sol) in a more general context.",
