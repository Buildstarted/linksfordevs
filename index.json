Opera was a\nviable fully-independent alternative. This all changed with the rise\nof the idea of a \"Living Standard\" (that is to say, a non-standard\nof endless layers of constantly-changing complexity for web technology),\nand more particularly Google Chrome, which adopted a rapid-release\nmodel right as its authors started having more influence on standards\ncommittees.",
