Since then, I‚Äôve been hired as a network programmer for a game company, where I primarily work on multiplayer stuff. Although I‚Äôve had some great experiences modding games, I‚Äôve always been skeptical of actually entering the video game industry.\nI remember friends asking me in my first few years of university if I‚Äôd apply to game companies once I graduated.",

    "Description": "Rust helps you to build reliable programs. One of the ways it does that is by surfacing things to your attention that you really ought to care about. Think of the way we handle errors with Result: if some operation can fail, you can‚Äôt, ahem, fail to recognize that, because you have to account for the error case. And yet often the kinds of things you care about depend on the kind of application you are building. A classic example is memory allocation, which for many Rust apps is No Big Deal, but for others is something to be done carefully, and for still others is completely verboten. But this pattern crops up a lot. I‚Äôve heard and like the framing of designing for ‚Äúwhat do you have to pay attention to‚Äù ‚Äì Rust currently aims for a balance that errs on the side of paying attention to more things, but tries to make them easy to manage. But this post is about a speculative idea of how we could do better than that by allowing programs to declare a profile.",
