    "Description": "In February 2024, I released an obstacle course game (obby) called Chill But Not Too Chill Obby on Roblox. The Roblox platform allows game developers to publish their own games built with the Roblox game engine (think: Netflix for games). Because Roblox handles many of the minute details of multiplayer game development, it's a great platform to learn game development on. For new Roblox developers, creating an obby as a first game seems to be a rite of passage, and my journey was no different.\n\n                What I thought would take only a week or two turned into a whole month-long adventure, with weekly updates from there on. My original draft was just a basic obby with routine obstacles. However, as I started working on the levels, I felt the urge to design unique and challenging obstacles. I wanted to create something I could be proud of, not just something that looked like the result of a homework exercise.\n                \n                Before diving into the game, I played more obbies on Roblox than I care to admit, trying to figure out what hooked players. I noticed a few things that these games had in common: an open-world environment, easy transitions from one level to the next, and simple object models. I decided to incorporate and expand upon these elements in my game to give players a sense of familiarity.",
