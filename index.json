    "Description": "The large municipalities in the Netherlands plan to make wide use of a legislative amendment that will allow them to designate neighborhoods where investors won't be allowed to buy cheap and medium-priced homes and rent them out, NOS found after surveying the municipalities. \n\nThis legislative amendment is expected to take effect on January 1. The intention is to give people looking for a home a better chance of finding one on the tight Dutch housing market. Last year, a third of all homes sold in the four large cities were bought by investors. "

    "Description": "It is important to know whether a gaming laptop has a MUX switch before buying it, because this feature lets you disable optimus and get a speed boost in games. About This List This list only includes gaming laptops that I have personally tested and verified as having a MUX switch. Unfortunately I have not tested every single model from every generation, however generally if say a 10th gen MSI GE66 has a MUX switch, I’d say it’s usually pretty safe to assume that the newer 11th gen version has it too – though this may not always be the case. It’s more common for this feature to be added in a newer model if it wasn’t there previously than for a company to remove it, but of course check laptop reviews where ever possible to confirm. Please note that some models with the same name may or may not have a MUX switch, unfortunately it can be confusing and difficult to determine. Likewise, it can also depend on the specs of the laptop itself. For example, the ASUS Zephyrus S17 with 4K screen does NOT have a MUX switch, while the 1440p model does have one. The Acer Triton 500 with RTX 2060 graphics does not have a MUX switch, while the higher end 2080 model does, so specs can matter too which is why I’ve listed these as well. How To Use This Data All laptops are sorted in alphabetical order. You can click the column headers to instead list all laptops that do or do not have a MUX switch, or simply search the model in the search box."
