    "Description": "Recently, there have been a number of exciting results concerning proof recursion. A sketch for Halo has suggested the possibility of proof recursion without a costly trusted setup, while Fractal has demonstrated the first instantiation of proof composition which is post-quantum secure. We’ll go into these results later after discussion what proof composition is, the technical challenges associated with achieving it, and how it ties into commonly used proof systems as Groth 16 and Bulletproofs.",
