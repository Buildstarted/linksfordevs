Terraform makes it easy to define infrastructure, but one wrong line of code can delete everything.

In this video, I walk you through everything you need to know to get started with DAPR - from installation and setup to building your first microservice application. You'll learn how DAPR simplifies cloud-native development by providing standardized building blocks that abstract away the complexity of distributed systems, allowing you to focus on your business logic instead of infrastructure concerns.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to leverage DAPR's service invocation to build resilient, scalable applications. Whether you're new to microservices architecture or looking to streamline your existing development workflow, this step-by-step guide demonstrates how DAPR can dramatically reduce development time and operational complexity while making your applications more portable across different environments and cloud providers.\n\nIntroduction to Dapr for .NET Developers\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/introduction-to-dapr-for-dotnet-developers\n\nInstall the Dapr CLI\nhttps://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/\n\nInitialize Dapr in your local environment\nhttps://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-selfhost/\n\nCheck out my courses:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/courses\n\nRead my Blog here:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog\n\nJoin my weekly .NET newsletter:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech\n\nChapters\n0:00 What is Dapr?\n1:31 Installing and running Dapr\n2:27 What we're going to build\n4:30 Building a Dapr application\n10:24 Running a Dapr application\n13:11 Closing thoughts on Dapr",
