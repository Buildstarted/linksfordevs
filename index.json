Most production users I know either already run with panic=abort or use unwinding in a very limited fashion, basically just to run to cleanup, not to truly recover. Removing unwinding from most case meanwhile has a number of benefits, allowing us to extend the type system in interesting and potentially very impactful ways. It also removes a common source of subtle bugs. Note that I am not saying we should remove unwinding entirely: that’s not an option, both because of stability and because of Rust’s mission to “deeply integrate” with all kinds of languages and systems.",
