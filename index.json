Coincidentally, on the same day UnHerd published an article by Patrick McGee, Time is running out for Tim Cook: Apple lacks strategic vision. I continue to admire McGee’s reporting, continue to recommend his book, and this new article hasn’t changed my mind about that. However, reporters who have made a name for themselves have a tendency to want to become commentators, to add their opinions to their factual reporting. In my own opinion, the opinions of reporters are no better than anyone else’s opinion. The ability to get quality news scoops doesn’t automatically make someone superior at analyzing the implications of that news. Another example of this phenomenon is Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, a prolific source of Apple leaks, unparalleled in tech reporting history; I salute his uncanny prowess as a reporter. Nonetheless, his opinions are pedestrian at best, ill-advised at worst, and I find it regrettable that Gurman’s articles sometimes muddy the distinction between his leaks and his opinions.",
