The web application uses an API that runs in an Azure Function (opens new window) to process the order. This works well, until the Azure Function is offline. To make sure that your application stays available, and that the web application and backend APIs can scale independently, you can decouple them with a queue. Azure Service Bus Queues (opens new window) provides a queue that helps with this."
