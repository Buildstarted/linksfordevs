    "Domain": "arxiv.org",
    "Description": "One of the most prominent and widely-used blockchain privacy solutions are\nzero-knowledge proof (ZKP) mixers operating on top of smart contract-enabled\nblockchains. ZKP mixers typically advertise their level of privacy through a\nso-called anonymity set size, similar to k-anonymity, where a user hides among\na set of $k$ other users.\n  In reality, however, these anonymity set claims are mostly inaccurate, as we\nfind through empirical measurements of the currently most active ZKP mixers. We\npropose five heuristics that, in combination, can increase the probability that\nan adversary links a withdrawer to the correct depositor on average by 51.94%\n(108.63%) on the most popular Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)\nmixer, respectively. Our empirical evidence is hence also the first to suggest\na differing privacy-predilection of users on ETH and BSC. We further identify\n105 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attackers leveraging ZKP mixers as the initial\nfunds and to deposit attack revenue (e.g., from phishing scams, hacking\ncentralized exchanges, and blockchain project attacks).\n  State-of-the-art mixers are moreover tightly intertwined with the growing\nDeFi ecosystem by offering ``anonymity mining'' (AM) incentives, i.e., mixer\nusers receive monetary rewards for mixing coins. However, contrary to the\nclaims of related work, we find that AM does not always contribute to improving\nthe quality of an anonymity set size of a mixer, because AM tends to attract\nprivacy-ignorant users naively reusing addresses.",
