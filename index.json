This process, known as\n          “chemotaxis”—the “chemo-” for chemical and the “taxis” from the Greek\n          τάξις, for tactics—is intelligence in one of\n          its most elemental forms. An individual E. coli has no brain,\n          obviously, and is even many orders of magnitude simpler than a human\n          cell, and yet already it possesses something like a sense of smell,\n          drive, even a memory.
