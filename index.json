By default EF Core automatically compiles and caches your queries using a hashed representation of the query expression - when the code runs the previously executed query, EF Core lookup the cache with the hash value and returns the compiled query from the cache. We can explicitly compile the query upfront and invoke the compiled query. To compile the query, EF Core exposes two extension methods in EF class - EF.CompileQuery() and EF.CompileAsyncQuery(). These methods helps us to create compiled queries and call them using a delegate.",
