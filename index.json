    "Description": "One of the pleasures of working at Mozilla, has been learning and using the\nMercurial version control system. Over the past decade, Iâ€™ve spent countless\nhours tinkering my worfklow to be just so. Reading docs and articles,\nmeticulously tweaking settings and even writing an extension.\nI used to be very passionate about Mercurial. But as time went on, the\nculture at Mozilla started changing. More and more repos were created in\nGithub, and more and more developers started using git-cinnabar to work on\nmozilla-central. Then my role changed and I found that 90% of my work was\nhappening outside of mozilla-central and the Mercurial garden I had created\nfor myself.\nSo it was with a sense of resigned inevitability that I took the news that\nMozilla would be migrating mozilla-central to Git. The fire in me was all but\nextinguished, I was resigned to my fate. And whatâ€™s more, I had to agree. The\ntime had come for Mozilla to officially make the switch.\nGlandium wrote an excellent post outlining some of the history of the\ndecisions made around version control, putting them into the context of the\ntime. In that post, he offers some compelling wisdom to Mercurial holdouts like\nmyself:\n\nIâ€™ll swim against the current here, and say this: the earlier you can switch\nto git, the earlier youâ€™ll find out what works and what doesnâ€™t work for you,\nwhether you already know Git or not.\n\nWhen I read that, I had to agree. But, I just couldnâ€™t bring myself to do it.\nNo, if I was going to have to give up my revsets and changeset obsolesence and\nmy carefully curated workflows, then so be it. But damnit! I was going to\ncontinue using them for as long as possible.\nAnd Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t switch because then I stumbled upon Jujutsu.",
