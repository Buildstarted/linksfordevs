    "Description": "QUIC is expected to be a game-changer in improving web application performance. In this paper, we conduct a systematic examination of QUIC's performance over high-speed networks. We find that over fast Internet, the UDP+QUIC+HTTP/3 stack suffers a data rate reduction of up to 45.2% compared to the TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 counterpart. Moreover, the performance gap between QUIC and HTTP/2 grows as the underlying bandwidth increases. We observe this issue on lightweight data transfer clients and major web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera), on different hosts (desktop, mobile), and over diverse networks (wired broadband, cellular). It affects not only file transfers, but also various applications such as video streaming (up to 9.8% video bitrate reduction) and web browsing. Through rigorous packet trace analysis and kernel- and user-space profiling, we identify the root cause to be high receiver-side processing overhead, in particular, excessive data packets and QUIC's user-space ACKs. We make concrete recommendations for mitigating the observed performance issues.",

If you let an LLM loose on a schema versus let an LLM loose on a semantic layer on top of that schema with some basic curation, you're going to get much better results.",

    "Description": "On January 15th, 1990, a single line of code triggered a cascading failure that crippled AT&T's long-distance network for nearly 9 hours, leaving millions of Americans unable to make calls. In today's episode of Dave’s Garage, we dive into the software bug that caused one of the largest telecommunications outages in history.\n\nWith AT&T controlling 70% of long-distance traffic, the outage impacted 50 million calls and cost the company $60 million in lost revenue. At the heart of the problem was a subtle race condition in the code running the SS7 signaling system—an error that passed unnoticed through code reviews and testing until the perfect storm of conditions exposed it.\n\nWe’ll walk through the technical details of the bug, how it spread through AT&T’s 114 switches, and the larger lessons it taught the telecom industry about software complexity and testing.
