    "Description": "We propose separating the task of reliable transaction dissemination from\ntransaction ordering, to enable high-performance Byzantine fault-tolerant\nquorum-based consensus. We design and evaluate a mempool protocol, Narwhal,\nspecializing in high-throughput reliable dissemination and storage of causal\nhistories of transactions. Narwhal tolerates an asynchronous network and\nmaintains high performance despite failures. Narwhal is designed to easily\nscale-out using multiple workers at each validator, and we demonstrate that\nthere is no foreseeable limit to the throughput we can achieve. Composing\nNarwhal with a partially synchronous consensus protocol (Narwhal-HotStuff)\nyields significantly better throughput even in the presence of faults or\nintermittent loss of liveness due to asynchrony. However, loss of liveness can\nresult in higher latency. To achieve overall good performance when faults occur\nwe design Tusk, a zero-message overhead asynchronous consensus protocol, to\nwork with Narwhal. We demonstrate its high performance under a variety of\nconfigurations and faults. As a summary of results, on a WAN, Narwhal-Hotstuff\nachieves over 130,000 tx/sec at less than 2-sec latency compared with 1,800\ntx/sec at 1-sec latency for Hotstuff. Additional workers increase throughput\nlinearly to 600,000 tx/sec without any latency increase. Tusk achieves 160,000\ntx/sec with about 3 seconds latency. Under faults, both protocols maintain high\nthroughput, but Narwhal-HotStuff suffers from increased latency.",
