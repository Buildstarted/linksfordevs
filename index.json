Although the einstein problem was answered, in some contexts (e.g., tile floors), you'd likely have to manufacture two separate tiles.  Our paper left open the question of whether a shape could tile aperiodically using translations and rotations only, with no reflections.\n\nI hate to sound like a broken record, but then, on March 26th, Dave noticed something interesting.
