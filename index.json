But how do I make sense of them? Have I started too many? Why aren’t any of them finished? And why do I feel so demotivated to work on any of them, even though I really want to work on one?"

While finding and fixing the vulnerable code is usually considered upstream’s responsibility, the packager needs to ensure that all these fixes reach the end users ASAP.  With the aid of central package management and dynamic linking, the Linux distributions have pretty much perfected the deployment of security fixes.  Ideally, fixing a vulnerable dependency is as simple as patching a single shared library via the distribution’s automated update system."
