When you operate at the line between API producers and consumers, but also the automation of the API lifecycle, you really begin to see that the balance between producer and consumer is what matters the most. Even with my perspective I am heavily indoctrinated into the API producer side of the conversation. After over a decade of working with API service providers who mostly are serving the API producer I just end up with a bias in that direction. Working at Postman has changed that, and since I hired Deepa Goyal on my team, I am regularly being schooled about why the consumer view needs more prioritization.",

Later, paper marbling traditions emerged in the Middle East and Europe, making use of more viscous media and fine-toothed combs to create repeating patterns with greater regularity and control. Marbled paper is commonly used in bookbinding as a decorative endpaper:",
