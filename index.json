There is a small gap right in the middle of the square. Put a circle there again such that it touches the other four circles. The central circle is obviously inside the square, right? Yes, but only if the dimension you are in is $D\\le9$. Above that, the central cicle actually spills out from the cube, despite the $2^D$ spheres in their cells keeping it in. In this post I present this simple-to-compute yet utterly counter-intuitive result.",
