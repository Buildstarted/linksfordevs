    "Description": "1Password recently announced that they rewrote their longstanding Mac application as an Electron application, and as one might expect, Mac users rightfully lost their shit. A lot of digital ink has been spilled on Electron apps, but to summarize, Electron applications are slow, use a ton of resources, and perhaps worse of all, they don’t look like native applications or follow native conventions. In just about every way, using an Electron application is a degraded experience."

Medium's paywall is an insult to good journalism by forcing specific users to pay for content of often questionable quality. The Medium paywall also makes for a suboptimal user experience. When sharing a Medium article, there is a high degree of uncertainty that the person opening the link will be asked to pay money to read the content. The Medium membership model doesn't work for several folks (likely you too). But, most importantly Medium dilutes your brand and negatively impacts essential metrics. If that's not enough read more on Why Medium Actually Sucks."

The scripting remains a viable option for migrations. For those who choose the code approach, and to mitigate some of the risks associated with the command line and application startup approaches, the EF Core team introduced the migration bundles in EF Core 6.0 Preview 7."
