    "Description": "The 28th annual Christmas lecture\nThursday, December 5, 2024\n\nA directed graph can often be best understood and used if we partition its vertices into separate components of various kinds. Most important are the strongly connected components, called “strong components” for short; and strong components are in turn partitioned into “weak components.”\n\nTwo definitions of weak components have appeared in the literature of graph theory. One of them is rather weak and uninteresting, while the other is becoming more and more relevant and appreciated (see weak components revived). Basically, the strong components are the smallest clusters of vertices that you can shrink to a point and obtain a dag, a digraph with no oriented cycles. The weak components, correctly defined, are the smallest clusters that you can shrink to a point and obtain an oriented path.\n\nDr. Knuth will discuss Robert Tarjan's beautiful algorithms for computing the strong and weak components of a given directed graph. (This will be fun because Dr. Knuth's personal favorite, among all of the algorithms of all kinds that he has encountered so far in his life, is Tarjan's method for discovering the strong components as it explores the graph.)\n\nFurthermore, if time permits, Dr. Knuth disclose the answer to the following riddle: In what major world city are shirts of size XL smaller than shirts of size L?\n\nSee more from Don Knuth: https://online.stanford.edu/donald-e-knuth-lectures\n\n► Check out our entire catalog of courses and programs: https://online.stanford.edu/explore",

When you conceptualize it, all the malicious input into your application comes across in an HTTP request at some point. It's either in the URL or in the body. That's generally speaking, unless you have a supply chain attack, that's generally the vector by which your application will be attacked. Before you even start to kind of think about specific vulnerabilities, if you narrow down what is permissible input right out of the gate, then you kind of close the door on so many different vulnerabilities without even thinking about it.\"— Malcolm McDonald\r\n\r\n Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie \"GaProgMan\" Taylor.\r\n\r\n In this episode, Malcolm McDonald joined us to talk about the importance of Application Security, knowing the basics of secure coding, and backing that all up with both \"secure by default\" designs, and subscribing to CVE notifications.\r\n\r\n \"So what you find in your career is that if you set down kind of sensible default behaviour in your codebase earlier on, then everyone will follow that. You establish, kind of, best practices. It might take a little bit longer, but if you say, \"this is the way we do this over here,\" then even yourself when you, kind of, come back to, will kind of, reproduce that path. So the initial, kind of, like first few check-ins to your source control are key to, like, establishing best practice\"— Malcolm McDonald\r\n\r\n One note before we begin: some of Malcolm's audio is a little rough. Mark, our superstar editor, has done what he can, but there are parts that might be a little unclear. If you have trouble with the audio, please remember that there is a full transcription linked in the accompanying show notes.\r\n\r\n Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.\r\n\r\n Supporting the Show If you find this episode useful in any way, please consider supporting the show by either leaving a review (check our review page for ways to do that), sharing the episode with a friend or colleague, buying the host a coffee, or considering becoming a Patron of the show.\r\n\r\n Full Show Notes The full show notes, including links to some of the things we discussed and a full transcription of this episode, can be found at:  https://dotnetcore.show/season-7/grokking-application-security-malcolm-mcdonald-on-securing-your-apps/\r\n\r\n Useful Links  Malcolm on LinkedIn Grokking Application Security Hacksplaining Hash function Don't Accept The Defaults Bcrypt  Supporting the show:  Leave a rating or review Buy the show a coffee Become a patron  Getting in Touch:  Via the contact page Joining the Discord  Remember to rate and review the show on  Apple Podcasts, Podchaser, or wherever you find your podcasts, this will help the show's audience grow.
