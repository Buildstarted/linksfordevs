So, in order to prevent myself from becoming a blocker on progress, I’ve decided to step back and hand over the reins to my co-maintainer Stefan Haller.\n\n",

But, despite the general discourse, they are not confusing for the sake of being confusing, and they are not a conspiracy to sell server cycles. Beneath the abstraction is fundamentally strong engineering that has unlocked both UX and DX gains that were previously inaccessible. I think it's worthwhile to learn their design and what problems they truly solve.",
