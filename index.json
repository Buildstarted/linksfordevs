However I still want\nto be able to interoperate with opam's file format and access packages\nfrom the opam repository. In this blog post we'll walk through creating\na flake.nix file to do this for a hello world project at github.com/RyanGibb/ocaml-nix-hello.\nOur aim is to make building an OCaml project, and setting up a\ndevelopment environment, as simple as one command.",

    "Description": "Confidential Computing (CC) fundamentally improves our security posture by drastically reducing the attack surface of systems. While traditional systems encrypt data at rest and in transit, CC extends this protection to data in use. It provides a novel, clearly defined security boundary, isolating sensitive data within trusted execution environments during computation. This means services can be designed that segment data based on least-privilege access principles, while all other code in the system sees only encrypted data. Crucially, the isolation is rooted in novel hardware primitives, effectively rendering even the cloud-hosting infrastructure and its administrators incapable of accessing the data. This approach creates more resilient systems capable of withstanding increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, thereby reinforcing data protection and sovereignty in an unprecedented manner.",
