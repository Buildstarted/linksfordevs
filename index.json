This latter opinion is typically\njustified by explaining that the incentives2 are not in favour of the\nauthors here: the default position for many journals and many\nconferences seems to be ‘reject unless proven to be sufficiently good,’\nmeaning that it is much easier for reviewers to suggest\nrejection than to engage with the content in a meaningful manner.",
