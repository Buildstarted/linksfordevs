He shares what developers can look forward to come the November release and provides a full rundown of what it looks like to use .NET MAUI from wrapping the local environment and building to testing to packaging and deploying. Don‚Äôt miss out on learning about what makes .NET MAUI a powerful tool you should be on the lookout for! &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:14] About The Azure DevOps Podcast, Clear Measure, the new podcast Architect Tips, and Jeffrey‚Äôs offer to speak at virtual user groups.

[21:10] If someone wanted to try out MAUI today, would David recommend that someone try out the preview today or wait for a future preview? [24:12] David gives a full rundown of what the process looks like to use .NET MAUI.
