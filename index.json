And I could bet that no one could say that some software definitely isn't firmware.\n\tThe annoying part is seems to serve as a way of hiding that it is in fact just plain software, meaning something you can modify, rewrite, audit, … albeit sometimes with the hardware putting some limits but that says more about the hardware than the software.\n\tIn fact you can sometimes avoid such hardware limitations with some flash storage instead, see Flash Cartridges for example, where you can even use data that used to be on a ROM on those, with no modifications to be done but then made easy.",
