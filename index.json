Throughout my career I mainly worked on low-latency C/C++ systems, and on performance engineering work directly (benchmarking, optimization work, etc) and Rust is trying to play in the same ballpark. Since retiring at the start of this year I’ve had a little more free time, so I’ve been spending more time writing Rust code for my personal projects and trying to contribute to some Rust OSS projects to get a feel for the language.",
