The weaknesses range “from technically trivial and easy to exploit to more advanced and of theoretical interest,” according to the security analysis. But ultimately they prove that the four key issues “could be done better, more securely and in a more trustworthy manner with a standard approach to cryptography,” said ETH Zurich Professor Kenny Paterson, who was part of the team that uncovered the flaw. The most significant of the vulnerabilities the researchers uncovered is what they called the “crime-pizza” vulnerability. In it, an attacker could alter the order of messages coming from a client to a cloud server that Telegram operates. “For example, if the order of the messages in the sequence ‘I say “yes” to’, ‘pizza’, ‘I say “no” to’, “crime” was altered then it would […]"
