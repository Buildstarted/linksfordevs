    "Description": "There is a lot of idealistic rhetoric in the software industry. That’s not exactly new, and for the most part we’re able to look past the often quite absolute language (the “musts” and the “bests”), and remember the importance of context. But that statement generally only holds when we talk about software engineering principles (tools, technologies, and design patterns). I feel we have a way to go when we talk about software delivery principles (people and processes).",
