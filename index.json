The\nauthor, prominent Prolog veteran Maarten van Emden, traces it back to a large\nJapanese-government project, \"Fifth-Generation Computer System\", active from\n1982 to 1992, which could've been Prolog's killer app, but instead failed and\ntook Prolog down with it.  I don't doubt that history might have been different\nif a few large Prolog projects in the 1980s turned out differently, and this\none in particular might be key. But with all due respect, I think a larger\nreason for Prolog gradually losing steam is that its uniqueness as a\ndeclarative language has been chipped away.",
