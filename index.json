    "Description": "In Azure Blob Storage (opens new window), you pay for the storage that blobs take up and the tier that they are stored in. For instance, blobs that are stored in the Hot tier (opens new window) are the most expensive and can be accessed directly. And blobs in the Archive tier (opens new window) are the least expensive and take a while to be accessed. This tiered system is great and works well when you actively move your blobs to the appropriate tiers. Azure Blob Lifecycle management (opens new window) makes this easier by automatically moving blobs or deleting them based on rules."
