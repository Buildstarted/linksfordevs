After a lot of indecision, I bought a 10th\ngeneration Thinkpad X1 with an Intel Core i7-1280P CPU, 32GB RAM, and\n1TB NVMe SSD.  While they don‚Äôt make Thinkpads like they used to, I‚Äôm\nstill really happy with it and glad I chose it.  Despite the keyboard\nchanges, the TrackPoint‚Ñ¢ is still there and I don‚Äôt think I could feel\ngood using a laptop without it.  Below I will explain all the steps I\ntook to get the Guix distribution setup nicely on it.
