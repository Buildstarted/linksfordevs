    "Description": "We present initial results of an ongoing engineering study on the feasibility\nof a space mission to the focal region of the solar gravitational lens (SGL).\nThe mission goal is to conduct exoplanet imaging operations at heliocentric\ndistances in the range ~548-900 astronomical units (AU). Starting at 548 AU\nfrom the Sun, light from an exoplanet located behind the Sun is greatly\namplified by the SGL. The objective is to capture this light and use it for\nmultipixel imaging of an exoplanet up to 100 light years distant. Using a\nmeter-class telescope one can produce images of the exoplanet with a surface\nresolution measured in tens of kilometers and to identify signs of\nhabitability. The data are acquired pixel-by-pixel while moving an imaging\nspacecraft within the image. Given the long duration of the mission, decades to\n900 AU, we address an architecture for the fastest possible transit time while\nreducing mission risk and overall cost. The mission architecture implements\nsolar sailing technologies and in-space aggregation of modularized functional\nunits to form mission capable spacecraft. The study reveals elements of such a\nchallenging mission, but it is nevertheless found to be feasible with\ntechnologies that are either extant or in active development.",
