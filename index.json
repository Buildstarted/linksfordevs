    "Title": "70% Size, 100% Accuracy: Lossless LLM Compression for Efficient GPU Inference via Dynamic-Length Float",
    "Url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11651",
    "Timestamp": "2025-04-26T01:02:03",

    "Description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown rapidly in size, creating significant challenges for efficient deployment on resource-constrained hardware. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic-Length Float (DFloat11), a lossless compression framework that reduces LLM size by 30% while preserving outputs that are bit-for-bit identical to the original model. DFloat11 is motivated by the low entropy in the BFloat16 weight representation of LLMs, which reveals significant inefficiency in existing storage format. By applying entropy coding, DFloat11 assigns dynamic-length encodings to weights based on frequency, achieving near information-optimal compression without any loss of precision. To facilitate efficient inference with dynamic-length encodings, we develop a custom GPU kernel for fast online decompression. Our design incorporates the following: (i) decomposition of memory-intensive lookup tables (LUTs) into compact LUTs that fit in GPU SRAM, (ii) a two-phase kernel for coordinating thread read/write positions using lightweight auxiliary variables, and (iii) transformer-block-level decompression to minimize latency. Experiments on recent models, including Llama-3.1, Qwen-2.5, and Gemma-3, validates our hypothesis that DFloat11 achieves around 30% model size reduction while preserving bit-for-bit exact outputs. Compared to a potential alternative of offloading parts of an uncompressed model to the CPU to meet memory constraints, DFloat11 achieves 1.9-38.8x higher throughput in token generation. With a fixed GPU memory budget, DFloat11 enables 5.3-13.17x longer context lengths than uncompressed models. Notably, our method enables lossless inference of Llama-3.1-405B, an 810GB model, on a single node equipped with 8x80GB GPUs. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/LeanModels/DFloat11.",

    "Description": "A recent event got me thinking. Why do we give social media that much power over our lives? I‚Äôm fairly young, but I‚Äôve had an experience of life without social media as it exists today. There was a time when we gauged how close certain friends were using more realistic metrics. Or at least I thought we were. A friend recently got into an argument with their real life bestfriend, mainly because one was not the other‚Äôs number one best friend on Snapchat, leaving my friend very confused. If you don‚Äôt use Snapchat a lot, you probably won‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about, so here‚Äôs some brief context. Snapchat assigns ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù tags to people you interact with, based on some algorithm that isn‚Äôt public. Now, was the person who got jealous wrong? Maybe not. But it‚Äôs alarming to witness the level of trust and reliance a person can place on such tagging to make real life decisions and judgments. I, for one, am not sure how exactly the tagging works because I do not work at Snapchat, but the more you interact with someone, the higher they appear on their best friend list. Yes, there‚Äôs a ranking as well, absurd. My whole issue is with Snapchat. Judging who someone‚Äôs best friend is, based solely on conversation frequency, is weird. Conversations have so much more depth to them, and context matters in every conversation*. The whole gist of such tagging is uncalled for and should be an opt-in feature. Well, enough of me ranting. I can only control what I can control, so I‚Äôve deleted Snapchat. My friend is, on the other hand, still treading the considerate route, soothing the ego of someone who seems a bit out of touch with reality.",
