    "Description": "We are excited to announce that Arch Linux is entering into a direct \ncollaboration with Valve. Valve is generously providing backing for two \ncritical projects that will have a huge impact on our distribution: a \nbuild service infrastructure and a secure signing enclave. By supporting \nwork on a freelance basis for these topics, Valve enables us to work on \nthem without being limited solely by the free time of our volunteers.\n\nThis opportunity allows us to address some of the biggest outstanding \nchallenges we have been facing for a while. The collaboration will \nspeed-up the progress that would otherwise take much longer for us to \nachieve, and will ultimately unblock us from finally pursuing some of \nour planned endeavors. We are incredibly grateful for Valve to make this \npossible and for their explicit commitment to help and support Arch Linux.\n\nThese projects will follow our usual development and consensus-building \nworkflows. [RFCs] will be created for any wide-ranging changes. \nDiscussions on this mailing list as well as issue, milestone and epic \nplanning in our GitLab will provide transparency and insight into the \nwork. We believe this collaboration will greatly benefit Arch Linux, and \nare looking forward to share further development on this mailing list as \nwork progresses.\n\n[RFCs]: https://rfc.archlinux.page/",
