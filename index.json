There have even been tests with USS America, normally an amphibious helicopter carrier, serving as a ‚ÄúLightning Carrier‚Äù.  Unfortunately, there are serious practical problems with all of this.  The simple fact is that there are major economies of scale in carrier aviation, and STOVL isn‚Äôt going to remove them, nor is something like America, lovely though she is, a good substitute for the CVNs.",
