    "Description": "There are different kind of performance indicators for disks. The most commonly known is probably throughput. When you use a USB stick you will immediately notice if it’s USB 2.0 or 3.x in case of a GiB sized data transfer. Another important performance indicator for storage is IOPS. IOPS is the number of I/O operations that the disk can handle per second. For example, a typical 7200U SATA HDD has about 75 IOPS, while a Samsung SSD 850 PRO has about 100k IOPS[1]. You’ve probably noticed a significant performance boost after replacing your HDD with a SSD for your operating system."

    "Description": "After a career change I have been working as a professional software developer for over ten years now, despite the fact I didn't study computer science or software engineering in university. In those ten years I've worked on projects for tiny startups that never made it, and big companies you've definitely heard of like the New York Times and Axel Springer. Occasionally friends approach me for advice and perspective about how they can learn to code as a career change or just as a hobby. One of the big problems is defining what \"knowing how to code\" means. It's very easy to pick up a coding tutorial or two and after finishing still feel near clueless and unsure of what to do next. Some very boasty (and unrealistic) books & tutorials claim to be able to teach you to code in twenty four hours or a weekend, some less optimistic experts suggest it could take ten years. I have an alternate theory."
