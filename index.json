For those unaware there are two “main” kernel mode drivers on Qualcomm SOCs for the GPU, there is the “MSM”, and “KGSL”. “MSM” is DRM compliant, and Freedreno already able to run on this driver. “KGSL” is the proprietary KMD that Qualcomm’s proprietary userspace driver targets. Now why would you want to run freedreno against KGSL, when MSM exists? Well there are a few ones, first MSM only really works on an up-streamed kernel, so if you have to run a down-streamed kernel you can continue using the version of KGSL that the manufacturer shipped with your device. Second this allows you to run both the proprietary adreno driver and the open source freedreno driver on the same device just by swapping libraries, which can be very nice for quickly testing something against both drivers.",
