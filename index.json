    "Description": "The internet is fast‚Äîuntil it‚Äôs not. Nobody likes waiting for a sluggish API response, and overloaded servers don‚Äôt help either. That‚Äôs where caching comes in. RESTful APIs embrace caching to improve performance, reduce server load, and create a smoother user experience. But caching isn‚Äôt just about speed‚Äîit‚Äôs about efficiency. Let‚Äôs dive into how REST makes caching an essential part of scalable web applications.",
