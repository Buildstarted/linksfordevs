The program needs to be able to call itself as many times as it wants. LLMs / diffusion models are said to be ‚ÄúTuring Complete‚Äù [1]. However, this is only true at test time, NOT during training. Infinite recursion is not possible in just one foreward pass of the model as is done during training. To make this work at all, we need to teacher force explicitly the intermediary goal states (per time step) to achieve any amount of success (CoT for LLMs, and a bit denoised noisy input for diffusion). However, this is much more limiting than most people can comprehend. We train it this way and then cross our fingers and hope that the non-recurrent model can be called in a while true loop and will magically become turing complete.",
