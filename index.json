Today, answering these questions requires developers to dig into logs, metrics, and traces—and this scavenger hunt is only if you're lucky enough to have observability installed! At Akita, we're building the first API-centric observability platform to make observability accessible for all developers. Two of the coolest parts of Akita's approach are 1) the ability to observe system behavior simply by dropping in and watching API traffic and 2)",
