I already wrote two blog posts Basic authentication middleware for ASP.NET 5 and Basic HTTP authentication in ASP.Net Web API on implementing Basic authentication. In this post I am implementing an AuthenticationHandler and using this for implementing basic authentication. As I already explained enough about the concepts, I am not discussing them again in this post.",

    "Description": "The Busy Beaver question asks: what is the longest that a Turing machine program of n states and k colors can run when started on the blank tape before halting? The function that maps from (n, k) to the longest run length is uncomputable and grows faster than any computable function.",

    "Description": "Time tracking has a bad reputation, it invokes images of managers watching over your shoulder or pay being docked as you punched in minutes before your shift ended. Due to these, and many more, if you suggest to someone to start tracking their time they’re likely to look at you like you’ve gone mad.\n",

This is back in the pre-systemd days \nof running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted \nby someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you \nstarted something, it might inherit one or more things from your \nenvironment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual \nenvironment, it might bestow those \"gifts\" onto anything it happened to \ntouch.",
