Companies, organizations, and individuals now have the power to interact, create, and integrate these models into their daily lives. With every conversation with the models, the notions generated and the flow of words make it increasingly apparent – the models we considered toys with the release of the Transformer architecture have surpassed the earlier realization. They exhibit a remarkable ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, a trait that used to be the standard of what it meant to be human. Simply put, the argument that only humans can comprehend and respond against the notion of a robot uprising has been rendered null.",
