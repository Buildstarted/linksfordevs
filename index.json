I thought we all understood that—aside from the considerable ethical concerns with the unauthorized scraping of everybody’s creative work, and the dismal treatment of the people who annotate that work, and the electricity it takes to compile those annotations into models, and the likelihood that companies will see this new technology as a cheaper alternative to their human employees—those things aside, I thought we agreed that all of these “AI” systems are fundamentally just making shit up, and that if they happen to construct coherent sentences more often than your phone’s predictive-text keyboard then the difference is one of degree rather than kind. It’s amazing that the technology works as well as it does, but it’s been clear for a while now that these tools are unreliable, and that that unreliability is inherent.",
