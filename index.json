    "Description": "A recent report of room temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure in\nCu-substituted apatite (`LK99') has invigorated interest in the understanding\nof what materials and mechanisms can allow for high-temperature\nsuperconductivity. Here I perform density functional theory calculations on\nCu-substituted lead phosphate apatite, identifying correlated isolated flat\nbands at the Fermi level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in\nalready established families of superconductors. I elucidate the origins of\nthese isolated bands as arising from a structural distortion induced by the Cu\nions and a chiral charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs. These results\nsuggest that a minimal two-band model can encompass much of the low-energy\nphysics in this system. Finally, I discuss the implications of my results on\npossible superconductivity in Cu-doped apatite",

    "Description": "The very recent claim on the discovery of ambient-pressure room-temperature\nsuperconductivity in modified lead-apatite has immediately excited sensational\nattention in the entire society, which is fabricated by sintering lanarkite\n(Pb2SO5) and copper(I) phosphide (Cu3P). To verify this exciting claim, we have\nsuccessfully synthesized Pb2SO5, Cu3P, and finally the modified lead-apatite\nPb10-xCux(PO4)6O. Detailed electrical transport and magnetic properties of\nthese compounds were systematically analyzed. It turns out that Pb2SO5 is a\nhighly insulating diamagnet with a room-temperature resistivity of ~7.18x10^9\nOhm.cm and Cu3P is a paramagnetic metal with a room-temperature resistivity of\n~5.22x10^-4 Ohm.cm. In contrast to the claimed superconductivity, the resulting\nPb10-xCux(PO4)6O compound sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P exhibits\nsemiconductor-like transport behavior with a large room-temperature resistivity\nof ~1.94x10^4 Ohm.cm although our compound shows greatly consistent x-ray\ndiffraction spectrum with the previously reported structure data. In addition,\nwhen a pressed Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O pellet is located on top of a commercial\nNd2Fe14B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic\nlevitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of a\nroom-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more careful\nre-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties.",

Carl and Richard talk to Layla Porter about choosing a middle ground between microservices and monoliths, with modular monoliths. Layla talks about the pushback from the community around microservices and the insistence that there is \"one right way.\" Monoliths have their advantages until they are a problem - but that doesn't mean that re-architecting everything is the right way to go. Chipping off parts of the monolith into satellite modules strikes a balance of flexibility and scalability - and opens the door to accessing the power of bus architectures when needed!",
