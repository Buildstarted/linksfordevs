It wraps the sometimes-obtuse (and oft-buggy)\nIndexedDB APIs with much more developer-friendly interfaces. And it is fully\nreactive; if you change something in the database, your React, Svelte, Vue,\nAngular, or Solid.js (Solid support is weak) app will live update all by\nitself! It’s a truly heavenly coding experience.\nHowever, web users do not live in a vacuum, and storing things in IndexedDB is\nfraught. The browser may delete that data on a whim, and who among us only has\none device these days? You might be able to use IndexedDB as a cache, but it\ncan’t be your source of truth.\nUntil today.",
