Some industries like healthcare require a high degree of data isolation, and using a database per tenant is a must.\nSo how are we going to implement multi-tenancy support with EF Core?\nWe can use Query Filters to apply a tenant filter to all database queries.\nImplement it once, and you can almost forget about it.",
