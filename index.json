Secondly must have been my chief complaint of Rust; although it is a wonderful language and ecosystem in many ways, you can't say that it's beautiful, which my previous love Haskell very much was. Thirdly then must been the talk Stop Writing Dead Programs by Jack Rusher, which opened my eyes to the prevalence of the write-compile-run development cycle and how we can escape from it. And last was my day-to-day usage of Emacs, whose configuration language is also a Lisp. Thanks Henrik.",

Painter examines the protocol's simplistic yet powerful nature, notably its stateless request/response framework, and how this has enabled a flexible and integrated web ecosystem. The blog also addresses the challenges and adaptations needed for modern applications, discussing alternative protocols like WebSockets and HTTP/3, yet emphasizing HTTP 1.1's capabilities in providing fluid user experiences. With practical examples, like a collaborative document editing app, Painter showcases HTTP's adaptability in meeting complex requirements of dynamic user interactions. This reflective piece is a must-read for anyone interested in the web's past, present, and future, emphasizing the protocol's versatility and importance in shaping the internet as we know it.",
