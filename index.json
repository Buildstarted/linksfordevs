We introduce FFTNet, an adaptive spectral filtering framework that leverages the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve global token mixing in $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$ time. By transforming inputs into the frequency domain, FFTNet exploits the orthogonality and energy preservation guaranteed by Parseval's theorem to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. A learnable spectral filter and modReLU activation dynamically emphasize salient frequency components, providing a rigorous and adaptive alternative to traditional self-attention. Experiments on the Long Range Arena and ImageNet benchmarks validate our theoretical insights and demonstrate superior performance over fixed Fourier and standard attention models.",
