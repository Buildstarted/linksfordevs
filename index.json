In contrast to those strengths, using a Shell to parse an INI config file is a bit like writing a poem in mud, you might succeed, but the result will probably be inscrutable and your swear jar will be full!"

    "Description": "The security of the Internet rests on a small number of open-source\ncryptographic libraries: a vulnerability in any one of them threatens to\ncompromise a significant percentage of web traffic. Despite this potential for\nsecurity impact, the characteristics and causes of vulnerabilities in\ncryptographic software are not well understood. In this work, we conduct the\nfirst comprehensive analysis of cryptographic libraries and the vulnerabilities\naffecting them. We collect data from the National Vulnerability Database,\nindividual project repositories and mailing lists, and other relevant sources\nfor eight widely used cryptographic libraries.\n  Among our most interesting findings is that only 27.2% of vulnerabilities in\ncryptographic libraries are cryptographic issues while 37.2% of vulnerabilities\nare memory safety issues, indicating that systems-level bugs are a greater\nsecurity concern than the actual cryptographic procedures. In our investigation\nof the causes of these vulnerabilities, we find evidence of a strong\ncorrelation between the complexity of these libraries and their (in)security,\nempirically demonstrating the potential risks of bloated cryptographic\ncodebases. We further compare our findings with non-cryptographic systems,\nobserving that these systems are, indeed, more complex than similar\ncounterparts, and that this excess complexity appears to produce significantly\nmore vulnerabilities in cryptographic libraries than in non-cryptographic\nsoftware."
