While doing so, I observed a number of downsides (long compile time, complicated operational model, lack of packaging) that were intrinsic to torch.compile's API contract, which emphasized being able to work on Python code as is, with minimal intervention from users.  torch.export occupies a different spot in the tradeoff space: in exchange for more upfront work making a model exportable, it allows for use of PyTorch models in environments where using torch.compile as is would be impossible.",

There are even mutant trig functions connected to this number, called sl and cl.   \n\nSo maybe while you were studying trig in high school, some kid in another galaxy was having to memorize all the identities for these other functions.\n\nI doubt it.  Just as pi and trig functions are connected to the circle, this number ϖ and its mutant trig functions are connected to a curve shaped like the symbol for infinity, ∞.   But this curve is just less important than the circle.  I'm not enough of a cultural relativist to believe there's a civilization that cares more about the shape ∞ than the shape ◯.\n\nThis ∞-shaped curve is called a 'leminscate', and ϖ is called the 'lemniscate constant'.   I'll show you the leminiscate in my next post.   \n\nA civilization will probably only get interested in ϖ when it gets interested in the lemniscate.... or the deeper math it's connected to.   On our planet, it was Bernoulli, Euler and Gauss who discovered this math.\n\n(Why does unicode even have the symbol ϖ?   Here's why: it's a script version of the Greek letter pi, sometimes called 'varpi' or 'pomega'.)\n\n(1/n)",
