A little under 400 users participated in the voting and discussion concerning the proposition that the Wikimedia Foundation stop accepting cryptocurrency donations.\n\nCommon arguments in support include: issues of environmental sustainability, that accepting cryptocurrencies constitutes implicit endorsement of the issues surrounding cryptocurrencies, and community issues with the risk to the movement‚Äôs reputation for accepting cryptocurrencies.\n\nCommon arguments in opposition include: the existence of less energy-intensive cryptocurrencies (proof-of-stake), that cryptocurrencies provide safer ways to donate and engage in finance for people in oppressive countries, and that fiat currencies also have issues with environmental sustainability.\n\nExcluding new accounts and unregistered users, the tally is 232 to 94, or 71.17% in support of the proposal. These results indicate overall community support, with a significant minority in opposition.\n\nThus, the Wikimedia community requests that the Wikimedia Foundation stop accepting cryptocurrency donations.\n\nHappy editing, Vermont üêøÔ∏è (talk) 22:56, 12 April 2022 (UTC)[reply]",
