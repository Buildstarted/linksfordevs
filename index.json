And, like\n                    most\n                    people, I failed. I used the rower sporadically for a while, and then I moved house, and it just sat\n                    there in my new home, gathering dust. I'd get the urge to start using it again (yes...January) and\n                    as usual, it didn't last. I've always done some form of exercise, either in the gym or running,\n                    and have had some long periods of running every week, but I don't think I've ever exercised\n                    consistently every week for a period longer than a year.",
