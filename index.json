To avoid string\nallocations, the hash value of the glyph bytes is used as a key instead.\n\nWhen Casey got asked about the possibility of hash collisions on stream,\nhe responded with a claim that the hash function used in refterm is “a strong hash”,\nand the complexity to find collision is about 2^64 operations.\nAfter analyzing the code for the hash function used in refterm, a few flaws\nwere found in the hash function, and O(1) attacks were discovered.\n\n",
