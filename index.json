    "Description": "Станом на 6 жовтня до Росії примусово депортовано понад 1,6 мільйона українців. Про це повідомив президент Володимир Зеленський під час виступу перед Генеральною асамблеєю Організації американських держав (ОАД). Нещодавно російська окупаційна адміністрація в Херсоні оголосила про так звану \"евакуацію\" мешканців регіону до РФ та окупованого Росією Криму, що насправді є нічим іншим, як продовженням тієї ж політики примусових депортацій та незаконного позбавлення волі, які раніше були застосовані російськими окупантами в Криму та на сході України.\n____________________________________\nMore than 1.6 million Ukrainians were forcibly deported to Russia. It was reported by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a speech at the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS). Recently, the Russian occupation administration in Kherson announced the so-called \"evacuation\" of the residents of the region to the Russian Federation and Russian-occupied Crimea, which in fact is nothing more than a continuation of the same policy of forced deportations and illegal deprivation of liberty, which was previously applied by the Russian occupiers in Crimea and on in the east of Ukraine.\n_________\nПідписуйтесь на @bykvu\n\n#новини #новиниукраїни #війна #росіяагресор #україна #StayWithUkraine #Ukraine #StayTogether #StandTogether #StopRussia #StopWar",

This means that even given all the computational power in the universe you could not compute these numbers. Even if God himself came from Heaven, he could not compute these numbers. Uncomputable numbers are numbers that can’t be computed because of maths limitations. Just the idea that maths has some inherent limits amazed me. In my last post, I talked about the halting problem, which is a limitation of maths, but the halting problem is a little bit abstract in my opinion. In this post, instead, I’ll show that there are numbers for which we can know an approximate value but can’t be known with arbitrary precision.",
