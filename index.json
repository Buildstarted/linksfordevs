    "Description": "A few months ago, I found myself wondering how a command like ping 1.1.1.1 works from within a private network.\nIn most private networks, multiple hosts connect to the Internet through a router. For IPv4, the router performs network address translation (NAT) by rewriting the original host‚Äôs source address to the router‚Äôs public IP address. The router can lookup the correct host for a reply packet based on the packet‚Äôs port field, at least for protocols like TCP and UDP.",
