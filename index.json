It’s also faster than the libspng, lodepng and stb_image\nC libraries as well as the most popular Go and Rust PNG libraries. High\nperformance is achieved by SIMD-acceleration, 8-byte wide input and copies when\nbit-twiddling and zlib-decompressing the entire image all-at-once (into one\nlarge intermediate buffer) instead of one row at a time (into smaller,\nre-usable buffers). All-at-once requires more intermediate memory but allows\nsubstantially more of the image to be decoded in the zlib-decompressor’s\nfastest code paths."
