It reduces cohesiveness and reusability, and makes adding new features more difficult.\nRich domain model attempts to solve this by encapsulating as much of the business logic as possible.\nBut how can you design a Rich domain model?\nThis is a never-ending process of moving business logic into the domain and refining your domain model.\nLet's see how to refactor from an Anemic domain model to a Rich domain model.",
