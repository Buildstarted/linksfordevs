    "Description": "There are a number of languages attempting something similar to what Hare is\ndoing by positioning itself as an alternative to C. However, there is an\nimportant trait which I think is necessary to understand Hare’s ambitions in\nthis space: Hare is explicitly attempting to emulate C’s 50+ year staying power.\nOne of Hare’s explicit design goals is to produce a programming language which\nwill be stable over a very long period of time, exceeding the lifetime of its\nauthors: I think of Hare as a 100-year programming language.",
