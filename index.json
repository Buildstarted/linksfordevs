Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt\nGet the source code here: https://www.patreon.com/milanjovanovic\n\nIn part 3 of our webhooks optimization series, I showcase how to transform a synchronous webhooks implementation into an asynchronous system for dramatically improved performance. Using OpenTelemetry traces, I demonstrate the bottleneck in our current webhook dispatch process, where each API request is being blocked by synchronous webhook processing. I then walk through the solution of decoupling webhook dispatch using Channels and a BackgroundService in .NET, allowing the API to respond quickly while webhooks are processed asynchronously. The video concludes with advanced techniques for maintaining proper distributed tracing context across async boundaries, ensuring we don't lose valuable observability in our new implementation.\n\nBuilding Async APIs in ASP.NET Core - The Right Way\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/building-async-apis-in-aspnetcore-the-right-way\n\nLightweight In-Memory Message Bus Using .NET Channels\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/lightweight-in-memory-message-bus-using-dotnet-channels\n\nCheck out my courses:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/courses\n\nRead my Blog here:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog\n\nJoin my weekly .NET newsletter:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech\n\nChapters\n0:00 Why the Webhooks won't scale\n2:10 Decoupling Webhook dispatch\n3:14 Webhooks processing - Channel and BackgroundService\n6:55 Improving OpenTelemetry tracing",
