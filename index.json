Jung believed dreams were projections of the unconscious—projections that sought to compensate for the conscious mind’s distortions. Famously, Jung did not disparage the ancient understanding of dreams as divine visitations. He believed gods themselves to be archetypal, projections of a shared unconscious.

    "Description": "For the first time in the world, we succeeded in synthesizing the\nroom-temperature superconductor ($T_c \\ge 400$ K, 127$^\\circ$C) working at\nambient pressure with a modified lead-apatite (LK-99) structure. The\nsuperconductivity of LK-99 is proved with the Critical temperature ($T_c$),\nZero-resistivity, Critical current ($I_c$), Critical magnetic field ($H_c$),\nand the Meissner effect. The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from minute\nstructural distortion by a slight volume shrinkage (0.48 %), not by external\nfactors such as temperature and pressure. The shrinkage is caused by Cu$^{2+}$\nsubstitution of Pb$^{2+}$(2) ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate\nand it generates the stress. It concurrently transfers to Pb(1) of the\ncylindrical column resulting in distortion of the cylindrical column interface,\nwhich creates superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. The heat\ncapacity results indicated that the new model is suitable for explaining the\nsuperconductivity of LK-99. The unique structure of LK-99 that allows the\nminute distorted structure to be maintained in the interfaces is the most\nimportant factor that LK-99 maintains and exhibits superconductivity at room\ntemperatures and ambient pressure.",
