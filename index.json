    "Description": "This book aims to provide an introduction to the topic of deep learning algorithms. We review essential components of deep learning algorithms in full mathematical detail including different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (such as fully-connected feedforward ANNs, convolutional ANNs, recurrent ANNs, residual ANNs, and ANNs with batch normalization) and different optimization algorithms (such as the basic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, accelerated methods, and adaptive methods). We also cover several theoretical aspects of deep learning algorithms such as approximation capacities of ANNs (including a calculus for ANNs), optimization theory (including Kurdyka-≈Åojasiewicz inequalities), and generalization errors. In the last part of the book some deep learning approximation methods for PDEs are reviewed including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep Galerkin methods. We hope that this book will be useful for students and scientists who do not yet have any background in deep learning at all and would like to gain a solid foundation as well as for practitioners who would like to obtain a firmer mathematical understanding of the objects and methods considered in deep learning.",

    "Description": "We introduce OpenVoice, a versatile voice cloning approach that requires only a short audio clip from the reference speaker to replicate their voice and generate speech in multiple languages. OpenVoice represents a significant advancement in addressing the following open challenges in the field: 1) Flexible Voice Style Control. OpenVoice enables granular control over voice styles, including emotion, accent, rhythm, pauses, and intonation, in addition to replicating the tone color of the reference speaker. The voice styles are not directly copied from and constrained by the style of the reference speaker. Previous approaches lacked the ability to flexibly manipulate voice styles after cloning. 2) Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Voice Cloning. OpenVoice achieves zero-shot cross-lingual voice cloning for languages not included in the massive-speaker training set. Unlike previous approaches, which typically require extensive massive-speaker multi-lingual (MSML) dataset for all languages, OpenVoice can clone voices into a new language without any massive-speaker training data for that language. OpenVoice is also computationally efficient, costing tens of times less than commercially available APIs that offer even inferior performance. To foster further research in the field, we have made the source code and trained model publicly accessible. We also provide qualitative results in our demo website. Prior to its public release, our internal version of OpenVoice was used tens of millions of times by users worldwide between May and October 2023, serving as the backend of MyShell.",
