The\nnews is unwelcome, but not entirely unexpected. What is unusual with this situation is\nthe number of Redis alternatives to choose from; there are at least\nfour options to choose as a replacement for those who wish to stay\nwith free software, including a pre-existing fork called KeyDB and the Linux Foundation's newly-announced Valkey project. The question now is which one(s)\nLinux distributions, users, and providers will choose to take its place.",

    "Description": "I was asked during an interview the other day from Paris whether I was a Post Keynesian. I replied not at all and explained that I have never felt that my ideas fit into that category although in a facile sense we are all post keynesian in a temporal sense. Most progressive economists would answer yes if confronted with that question, even most of the economists involved in advancing Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). My point of departure is that while there was a lot of important analytical material in Keynes’ writing that is worth preserving and integrating into, say, MMT, where Keynes went astray was his antipathy to the insights provided by Karl Marx. In particular, I consider that Keynes seriously misunderstood what the dynamics of the class conflict were within a capitalist mode of production. Keynes made major errors in his predictions that one can directly attribute to this blinkered approach to capitalism. I was reminded of this when I read an Op Ed in the Japan Times this week (March 10, 2024) – The economic future of our overworked grandchildren. This blinkered approach, which has fed into the modern Post Keynesian literature – which examines capitalism as if it is an ahistorical, neutral system of production and distribution – is a major reason that I do not associate my work with that school of thought.",

Interestingly, the attacks generated by GCG also transferred to black-box models, implying the existence of a shared, underlying set of common vulnerabilities across models.\nGCG is a perfectly good initial attack algorithm, but one common complaint is its lack of efficiency.",
