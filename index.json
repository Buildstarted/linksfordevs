    "Description": "Edit: greetings Hacker News. This is a cross-post from my own blog, \nAcesoUnderGlass.com. If you enjoy this post, consider checking that out as well.\n\nBack when I was at Google we had a phrase, “I don’t know how to count that low”.\nIt was used to dismiss normal-company-sized problems as beneath our dignity to\nengage with: if you didn’t need 100 database shards scattered around the globe,\nwere you even doing real work?\n\nIt was used as a sign of superiority within Google, but it also pointed at a\nreal problem: I once failed a job interview at a start-up when I wondered out\nloud if the DB was small enough to be held in memory, when it was several orders\nof magnitude lower than when I should even have begun worrying about that. I\ndidn’t know the limit because it had been many years since I’d had a problem\nthat could be solved with a DB small enough to be held in its entirety in\nmemory. And they were right to fail me for that: the fact that I was good at\nsolving strictly more difficult problems didn’t matter because I didn’t know how\nto solve the easier ones they actually had. I could run but not walk, and some\nproblems require walking.\n\nIt’s a problem, but it can be a pleasant kind of problem to have, compared to\nothers. Another example: my dad is a Ph.D. statistician who spent most of his\nlife working in SAS, a powerful statistical programming language, and using\n“spreadsheet statistics” as a slur. When I asked permission to share this\nanecdote he sent me a list of ways Excel was terrible.\n\n\n\nThen he started consulting for me, who was cruelly unwilling to pay the $9000\nlicense fee for SAS when Google Sheets was totally adequate for the problem (WHO\nHAS FOOD AT HOME NOW DAD?!?).*\n\nMy dad had to go through a horrible phase of being bad at the worse tool, and\nfound a lot of encouragement when I reframed “I could have done this with one\nline in SAS and am instead losing to this error-riddled child’s toy” to “I\ndidn’t know how to count that low, but now that it matters I am",

Because even though I’d only just started, I already had a bug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(There is a piece missing from the bottom of this rectangle. There should not be a piece missing from the bottom of this rectangle.)\nNow, I’m sure that I wrote plenty of bugs over the course of writing my raycaster, and I didn’t bother writing tests for any them – I just fixed them, re-ran the code, and manually verified that the bug had disappeared.\nBut this bug was a very shy bug. It was hard to manually reproduce it; it was hard to trigger the exact conditions that caused it. So it would have been really annoying to fix it using my usual guess-and-check approach – it’d be much easier to trigger the conditions once, print out the state, put that into a test, and then re-run the test until I had a fix.\nBut, sadly, things are not so simple.\nBecause I cannot actually write tests.\nI can only write self-modifying tests.\nIt’s an unfortunate, incurable condition. Now that I am used to writing self-modifying tests, I can’t go back to writing tests strewn with boolean assertions. I have tasted of ambrosia, and cannot now return to wine.",
