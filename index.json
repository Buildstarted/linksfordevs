    "Description": "Back when I was starting to code several years ago. I picked up The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric Raymond and I was blown away at the idea of free software. Just in case you are not familiar, free software as in freedom and not free beer. Free software back then was this super radical and idealistic concept where as you make a software product commercial or not, but when you distribute it you include the source code of it. The person who got your product would eventually continue to develop it and it will evolve and continually improve as it gets to many users. You then will be looking at their version of your product and will see how it has grown further. Think of it has a community garden where everyone grows their vegetable and anyone would then take pointers on some of your crops and grow their improved version. Eventually you’ll see where you are doing it wrong by looking at how they tend their garden. This is not necessarily free food for everyone – although it’s common. It’s freedom to copy and use my garden setup so we have bigger crops next harvest time."

The sales pitch of course was\n            presented in a light of \"helping employers identify 'less productive' employees, and give transparency to\n            team\n            leaders on performance\".
