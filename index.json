There's certainly tons of performance work, but it's also about making the code easier to read, easier to write and more maintainable. Weâ€™ll learn practical performance tips by using modern techniques around span, stackalloc and more. Increase readability through u8 literal strings, speed application development through tuples and records, and improve maintainability through nullability annotations.Â  Breakout: BRK204H | English (US) This session was delivered as part of the Microsoft Ignite 2022 event.
