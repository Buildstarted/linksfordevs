    "Description": "Why do we give social media so much power over our lives? I‚Äôm fairly young, but I‚Äôve had a good experience of life without social media as it exists today. There was a time when we gauged how close certain friends were using much more realistic metrics‚Äîbut it seems that‚Äôs lost among the youth now. I recently got into an argument with a friend, mainly because she was not my number one best friend on Snapchat, and I was very confused. If you don‚Äôt use Snapchat a lot, you probably won‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about, so here‚Äôs some brief context. Social media platforms like Snapchat assign ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù tags to people you interact with, based on some algorithm that obviously isn‚Äôt public. Now, was this person wrong for being jealous? Maybe not. But I‚Äôm alarmed at the level of trust and reliance people place on such tagging to make real life decisions. I‚Äôm not sure how the tagging works exactly, but the more you interact with someone, the higher they appear on your best friend list. My issue is with Snapchat. Judging who my best friend is based solely on conversation frequency is weird. Conversations have so much more depth to them‚Äîcontext matters. Overall, I just feel like I should be able to opt out of that feature entirely, so I don‚Äôt appear on anyone‚Äôs best friend list and no one appears on mine. I can only control what I can control, so I‚Äôve deleted Snapchat and ended the friendship.",
