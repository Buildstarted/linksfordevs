In reality, they are largely additive: you don't have to fetch your data on the server and you don't have to run a server at all. What React Server Components do is give you optionality to decide where you want your code to run: the server, the client, or both. And when: build-time or run-time. It gives you the ability to move between those environments seamlessly through composition. For experts who want freedom of choice, RSCs are a powerful solution. If you find them confusing, it's because nothing like them has existed before, but once you internalize their design, you'll see why their ideas will live on for a long time.",

In this post, we’re going to examine string length limiting deeply enough to help us fully grok what it means when we do it and how best to do it… and discover that the best still isn’t great.",
