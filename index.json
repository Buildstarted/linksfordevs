    "Description": "Airborne transmission by droplets and aerosols is important for the spread of viruses. Face masks are a well-established preventive measure, but their effectiveness for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still under debate. We show that variations in mask efficacy can be explained by different regimes of virus abundance and related to population-average infection probability and reproduction number. For SARS-CoV-2, the viral load of infectious individuals can vary by orders of magnitude. We find that most environments and contacts are under conditions of low virus abundance (virus-limited) where surgical masks are effective at preventing virus spread. More advanced masks and other protective equipment are required in potentially virus-rich indoor environments including medical centers and hospitals. Masks are particularly effective in combination with other preventive measures like ventilation and distancing."

    "Description": "When you have an interest in cryptography, and you occasionally browse reddit, you’ve probably seen something like this before. Someone creates a new post on r/crypto or r/cryptography, claiming to be able to efficiently factor integers or RSA moduli. This then usually goes hand in hand with a serious lack of context and explanation, notation that is questionable at best, often just plain unreadable, and an aversion to providing even minimal proof by factoring an actual, cryptographically big modulus. Yet because it’s hard to understand, and sometimes there’s math involved that at first glance seems like it might have some deeper meaning, you’re left wondering, is there some insight to be found here. Spoiler alert: nope…"
