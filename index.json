With Node being the default choice for many, Bun has to prove it is worthy of your attention. It makes strong claims:\nThere’s a benchmark right on the homepage, claiming almost 5 times more requests per second than Node! 1. In the documentation, they claim that “In most cases, the startup and running performance is faster than V8, the engine used by Node.js and Chromium-based browsers.” Part of what makes this an interesting comparison is that Node uses the V8 engine (which also powers Chromium-based browsers), while Bun uses JavascriptCore (which powers Safari).\n",

    "Description": "The scalability limitations of Transformers regarding sequence length have renewed interest in recurrent sequence models that are parallelizable during training. As a result, many novel recurrent architectures, such as S4, Mamba, and Aaren, have been proposed that achieve comparable performance. In this work, we revisit traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) from over a decade ago: LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). While these models were slow due to requiring to backpropagate through time (BPTT), we show that by removing their hidden state dependencies from their input, forget, and update gates, LSTMs and GRUs no longer need to BPTT and can be efficiently trained in parallel. Building on this, we introduce minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use significantly fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts and (2) are fully parallelizable during training (175x faster for a sequence of length 512). Lastly, we show that these stripped-down versions of decade-old RNNs match the empirical performance of recent sequence models.",
