They had a spreadsheet with some data, and wanted to classify the rows in the spreadsheet by a few different criteria along which they would look for trends. For an engineer, this would have been a quick Python script wrapping some classifier (in our case, the OpenAI API), but there wasn‚Äôt an engineer available for the project. We looked at some third-party plugins for Google Sheets, but it wasn‚Äôt clear what sorts of guarantees they made around data privacy, and we didn‚Äôt feel comfortable installing them. So, with some help from OpenAI‚Äôs o3, I created Rich, an OpenAI-powered CSV data enricher that‚Äôs a fully client-side single-page application.",
