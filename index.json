I consider this to be one of the most interesting ways to evaluate the quality of a generative algorithm, and certainly one that is unique to the medium. Striking the right balance of unpredictability and quality is a difficult challenge for even the best artists in this field. This is why I’m so excited that Fidenza is being showcased on Art Blocks, the only site in existence that perfectly suits generative art and raises the bar for developing these kinds of high-quality generative art algorithms."

These questions concern: the\noutstanding generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the role\nof depth in deep architectures, the apparent absence of the curse of\ndimensionality, the surprisingly successful optimization performance despite\nthe non-convexity of the problem, understanding what features are learned, why\ndeep architectures perform exceptionally well in physical problems, and which\nfine aspects of an architecture affect the behavior of a learning task in which\nway. We present an overview of modern approaches that yield partial answers to\nthese questions. For selected approaches, we describe the main ideas in more\ndetail."
