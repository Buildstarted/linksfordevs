They are extremely powerful, and very easy to write, but they can be pretty tricky to get right. It’s easy to make mistakes that lead to unwanted variable capture, or to write macros that only work if they’re expanded in particular contexts, and it can be pretty difficult to detect these problems ahead of time.\nSo people have spent a lot of time thinking about ways to write macros more safely – sometimes at the cost of expressiveness or simplicity – and almost all recent languages use some sort of hygienic macro system that defaults to doing the right thing.\nBut as far as I know, no one has approached macro systems from the other direction. No one looked at Common Lisp’s macros and said “What if these macros aren’t dangerous enough? What if we could make them even harder to write correctly, in order to marginally increase their power and expressiveness?”\nSo welcome to my blog post.",
