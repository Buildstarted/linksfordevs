In order to do that, compilers have to know a whole bunch of information, ranging from individal instruction’s latency to microarchitecture details. The system that describes these is called a scheduling model. In LLVM, a scheduling model is used by not just the instruction scheduler, but also target-specific optimizations like MachineCombiner and components like MCA (Machine Code Analyzer)1.",
