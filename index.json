Anybody with some experience in ML can probably guess what I did, at least on a high level: I scraped terabytes of data from the internet and trained a neural network on it. However, I ended up learning more than I expected to along this journey. For example, this was the first time Iâ€™ve observed clear and somewhat surprising positive transfer across prediction tasks. In particular, I found that predicting additional details about each car (e.g. make and model) improved the accuracy of price predictions. Additionally, I learned a few things about file systems, specifically EXT4, that threw me off guard. And finally, I used AI-powered image editing to uncover some interesting behaviors of my trained classifier.",
