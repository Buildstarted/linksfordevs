Essentially, it suggests that it can be more efficient to encode a number using a variable-length representation instead of a fixed-size binary representation. By removing leading zeros from the binary number, the overall representation size can be reduced. This technique works particularly well for encoding smaller numbers.\nIn this article, I provide a brief introduction and rationale for varint encoding.",
