    "Description": "I've recently been working on internal CI infrastructure for testing kernels before sending them to the mailing list. As part of this effort, I became interested in reproducible builds. Minimising the changing parts outside of the source tree itself could improve consistency and ccache hits, which is great for trying to make the CI faster and more reproducible across different machines. This means removing 'external' factors like timestamps from the build process, because the time changes every build and means the results between builds of the same tree are no longer identical binaries. This also prevents using previously cached results, potentially slowing down builds (though it turns out the kernel does a good job of limiting the scope of where timestamps appear in the build).",

Last night, Rodriguez rejected the compromise amendment, turning his back on digital creators and a Senate process lauded as one of the most comprehensive ever. In doing so, he has left no doubt about the government’s true intent with Bill C-11: retain power and flexibility to regulate user content.",
