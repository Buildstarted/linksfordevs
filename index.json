The key insight into the improvements, that have let the dynamic linking process scale to 1 million relocation entries and up to 22x speedup compared to the traditional methadology, is memoizing the relocation entries. This memoization is possible since the linking order of the loader is deterministic and in store-based systems such as NixOS the libraries to be loaded are fixed & static.",
