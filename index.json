Few days back I got a question / comment in the blog post about Minimal APIs - about implementing Basic authentication in Minimal APIs. Since the Action Filters support is not available in Minimal API I had to find some alternative approach for the implementation. I already wrote two blog posts Basic authentication middleware for ASP.NET 5 and Basic HTTP authentication in ASP.Net Web API on implementing Basic authentication. In this post I am implementing an AuthenticationHandler and using this for implementing basic authentication. As I already explained enough about the concepts, I am not discussing them again in this post.",

Angular Universal executes on the server, generating static application pages that later get bootstrapped on the consumer. This implies that the appliance usually renders additional quickly, giving users an opportunity to look at the appliance layout before it becomes totally interactive.",
