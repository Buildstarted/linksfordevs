    "Description": "Background Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of face masks mandates has been intensely debated. Many methods have been used to demonstrate mask effectiveness, including one that compares the change in reproduction number following implementing and removing face mask mandates[1][1].\n\nMethods Using data from Utah, we calculated the effect of mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district from before and after three key mandates: the Salt Lake and Summit County (SLSC) mask mandates enacted; the Utah statewide mask mandate enacted; and the Utah statewide mandate was lifted.\n\nResults We found that most counties had a reduction in the growth rate of cases following the mandates. There were reductions in EFm in many counties after the introduction of the SLSC mask mandates and a more widespread reduction in EFm across the state following the statewide mandate. Lifting the mandates, many counties across the states saw an increase in EFm.\n\nConclusion Our data show mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission both within the jurisdiction they were enacted and in neighboring jurisdictions. We provide evidence to support mask mandates as a way to prevent transmission to be better equipped to respond to future pandemics.\n\n### Competing Interest Statement\n\nACH, HES, and LTK acknowledge research support by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (75D30121F00003 and 1U01CK000585-01).
