I am\ndesigning Dawn to be a practical, general-purpose programming language that\ncombines the factorability of Forth, the purity and expressiveness\nof Haskell, and the performance and control of C,\nwith safety and correctness guarantees beyond those provided by\nRust. Now, if you’re at all familiar with these languages, then\njust from reading that sentence you might have an inkling that I’m either a\ncrackpot or painfully naive. If you did, then I applaud your skepticism.\nNonetheless, I believe I have glimpsed a path to this seemingly impossible\nconfluence of properties, and in this series of blog posts I hope to share at\nleast a part of that vision with you."
