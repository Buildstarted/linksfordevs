Yet, because of it‚Äôs ease and simplicity to just ‚Äúget something working‚Äù, it‚Äôs also one of the most underappreciated.\nIf you search for Top 10 Advanced Python Tricks on Google or any other search engine, you‚Äôll find tons of blogs or LinkedIn articles going over trivial (but still useful) things like generators or tuples.\nHowever, as someone who‚Äôs written Python for the past 12 years, I‚Äôve come across a lot of really interesting, underrated, unique, or (as some might say) ‚Äúun-pythonic‚Äù tricks to really level up what Python can do.",
