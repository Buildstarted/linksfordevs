All 290 people on board the airliner were killed.\n\nAt the time, the disaster was met with puzzlement. The Vincennes was equipped with the then-brand new Aegis Combat System, the world's most advanced air-defense system. Driven by cutting-edge computer technology, Aegis had been designed to identify, track and shoot down hundreds of Soviet bombers at a time. How could it possibly have erred so badly when faced with a single civilian airliner?\n\nThe U.S. Navy's official report cleared Aegis completely, blaming the ship's crew instead. But details of how Aegis operated that day came out later that strongly suggest that the shoot-down happened at least in part because of profound flaws in Aegis' user interfaces. \n\nIf you're unfamiliar with this incident, Wikipedia has a page on it that will give you a good overview (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655). So rather than recap the whole incident, I'd like to focus in on the user interface problems that led the captain and crew of the Vincennes to make such a devastating error.\n\n(This will be a thread, it's a complicated subject. I'll keep it as short as I can, I promise.)\n\n🧵​ 👇​",
