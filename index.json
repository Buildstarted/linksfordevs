When one tries to add proper error handling into their code it gets much more complicated than just implementing the happy path. Part of it is inescapable because it's essential complexity, but part of the complication is not necessary hence accidental complexity. A lot of production code either ignores errors or simply accumulate them to the top level with a generic error message. It's very rare that all possible error cases are even considered before implementation, let alone reflected in the code.",

We could replace the faulty chips with better ones, if they arrive before the deadline. Bob I don‚Äôt think we can afford to wait - the deadline is in 3 days. A better option is to rewrite the code to avoid the OR operation. Alice How could we do that? We‚Äôre using the OR operation in a lot of critical places.

The authorize_access function is used to check if a user is authorized to access a resource. The or operation is used to combine the conditions.
