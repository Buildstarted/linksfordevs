A dormant inner geek took over and Mike became very much more interested in developing websites than selling advertising space on them. &nbsp; As well as books such as those in the Wrox Beginner series, Mike became reliant on the enormous amount of free help provided by online communities while he learned his new craft. Mike is now one of the all-time leading contributors to the official ASP.NET forums at  and is also a moderator there. &nbsp; As a result of his contributions to the ASP.NET community via the forums, and through his technical article site at , Mike received the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award for ASP.NET from 2008 to 2018. Beginning ASP.NET Web Pages with WebMatrix is Mike’s first book. &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [3:06] How did Mike decide to leave school to become a programmer? [5:42] Jeffrey and his son are programming their own video game! [7:17] What sparked his interest in Razor and writing his new book, ? [9:51] What is the framework that Mike uses in his day-to-day job? [10:37] How would Mike classify the types of websites or web applications that are perfect for Razor pages, and maybe had some difficulties with other frameworks? [14:16] Are there any commonalities that you lose if you do the application with Razor pages and not MVC? [16:32] How does Mike organize his feature folders?
