    "Description": "Imagine designing a user interface filled with distinct elements, each boasting its unique header and intricate details. To achieve a streamlined visual layout and save space, consider displaying only the headers and revealing the details upon selection. With the Expander control from the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit, this vision is entirely attainable. Join me, and I'll guide you step-by-step to a implementation. üíï\nThe explanation will be divided into the following points:\n\n\nüîπ .NET MAUI Community Toolkit: Implementation\nüîπ ¬†What is a Expander?\nüîπ ¬†How to implement it?\n\n\n\n\nüîß¬†First of all... What do I need to know?\nWhat is .NET MAUI Community Toolkit??\n\n \tIt‚Äôs a collection of reusable elements such as animations, behaviors ¬†converters, among others, for developing applications for iOS, Android, macOS and WinUI using MAUI.\n\n‚úçÔ∏è Important!¬†Adding this configuration to your project just once is enough to fully benefit from the Community Toolkit. If you've already implemented it using another NuGet feature, feel free to skip this step.\n\n\n\n[expand title=üîß Still haven't implemented it? Check it here!\n\n]\n\n \tAdd from NuGet Package: Community.Toolkit.Maui\n\n\n\n \tNow let‚Äôs initialize:¬†Go to your MauiProgram.cs file\n\nIn the CreateMauiApp method, place in the .UseMauiApp<App>()¬†line and just below it add the following line of code:\n\n\n\n‚ö† Don‚Äôt forget to add the using CommunityToolkit.Maui;at the top of the class.\n\n[/expand]\n\n \tFinally, add the following namespace:\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's start!\nWhat is a Expander?\nThe Expander serves as an expandable container which is composed of a header (the content visible before expansion) and a container, designed to hold the detailed content linked to each header.\n\n\n\n\nHow to implement it?¬†\nIn order to show the Expander on screen, you must utilize two elements: The Header and The Content. Each one of these includes specific properties that help in the Expander configuration.\nLet's see a preview of what the structure should be like, and consequently we will start detailing the explanation.\n\n\nHowever, before delving into incorporating the two previously mentioned elements, it is important to add the tags that will house them. To establish this foundation, you simply need to integrate the following tags provided below:\n\n\n\n\n\nüîπ Header\nThe header remains constantly in view, and a simple click or tap will expand or hide the content. Ensure you populate it with read-only material, steering clear of controls demanding further user engagement.\nExactly where it says <!-- The Header element goes here--> in the previous block, add the <Expander.Header> tags, here¬†you can add all the visual elements you need, for this example I have only added a Label.\n\n\nüîπ Content\nThe content is what the user will see when interacting with the header, fluidly alternating between its visibility and hiding each time the header is selected.\nThe integration is intuitive and you do not need additional tags. Once you've set your header tags, simply add an element to hold the detailed content. For this example I will use the VerticalStackLayout, within the layout I can add all the visual elements I need.\n\nüö´ Limitations\n‚ûñ Expander does not support ListView on iOS/MacCatalyst.\n\n\n\n\nAnd done! üòé From now on, you are ready to use Expander in your .NET MAUI applications! üíöüíï\n\n<Label Text=‚ÄùThanks for reading!¬†üëã ‚Äù />\n\nSpanish post:\n\n \thttps://es.askxammy.com/explorando-el-expander-de-net-maui-community-toolkit/\n\nReferences:\n\n \thttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/maui/views/expander#basic-usage?tabs=ios?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-50033\n",

    "Description": "We've been building Unity for 15 years with the vision of creating an open and accessible tool to enable creators to build whatever you can dream of.\nOver the last week there was much confusion, and untrue statements were raised which we refuted. But most importantly we listened to you, our community that felt that the End User License Agreement (EULA)/Terms of Service (TOS) was too restrictive.\nWhen you make a game with Unity, you own the content and you should have the right to put it wherever you want. Our TOS didn't reflect this principle - something that is not in line with who we are.\nWe believe the Unity Engine business model is the best way for developers to be successful. We charge a flat fee per-seat -- not a royalty on all of your revenue. Building Unity takes a lot of resources, and we believe that partnerships make better services for developers and augment our business model -- as opposed to charging developers to pay for Unity‚Äôs development through revenue share.\nOur TOS update on December 5 was an attempt to define what our terms mean for the cloud and an opportunity to make our business model clearer. After listening to developers, we realized how this language came across, and how it would impact your ability to choose.\nOverview of Today‚Äôs TOS Update \nToday we have updated our Terms of Service, Section 2.4. The language is at the bottom of this post.\nThe TOS update highlights that developers can use any third party service that integrate into Unity.\nSome of these services will be supported, others will not. \nThe distinction is that with a supported service, we understand the technology. We make sure the service and Unity work better together for developers. We also ensure that the supported service always runs well on the latest version of our software, so we can help future proof your project in Unity and ensure access to the latest tech. \nAdditionally we have created, and will continue to create, our own services. We will integrate our own services, but we will not block developers from using competitive third-party services.\nRetroactive TOS changes\nWhen you obtain a version of Unity, and don‚Äôt upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS. \nIn practice, that is only possible if you have access to bug fixes. For this reason, we now allow users to continue to use the TOS for the same major (year-based) version number, including Long Term Stable (LTS) builds that you are using in your project.\nMoving forward, we will host TOS changes on Github to give developers full transparency about what changes are happening, and when. The link is https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/TermsOfService.\nImprobable\nToday‚Äôs change in our TOS means Improbable is no longer in breach by providing you a service, and that we are able to reinstate their licenses. But we do not consider them a partner, and cannot vouch for how their service works with Unity as we have no insight into their technology or how they run their business. \nWe know Improbable was in violation even before the December TOS update and misrepresented their affiliation with us. Although SpatialOS is not a supported third-party service, it can continue to be used for development and shipping games. \nWe are holding an AMA on r/Unity3d at 10 a.m. PST to discuss this TOS update in more detail.\n\n\nSection 2.4 ¬†Working with Third Party Service Providers.\nUnity developers are free to use any service offered to Unity developers (each, a ‚ÄúThird Party Service‚Äù). ¬†Unity does not have any obligation to provide support for any Third Party Service provider or Third Party Service under this Agreement.\nThird Party Service providers may not, without Unity‚Äôs express written permission: (1) use a stylized version of any Unity name, trademark, logos, images or product icons, or other Unity-owned graphic symbols; (2) use a product name confusingly similar to a Unity product or that could be construed by Unity developers as being a Unity product or service; or (3) create or use any marketing materials that suggest an affiliation with, or endorsement by, Unity. ¬†All use of Unity‚Äôs trademarks must comply with¬†Unity‚Äôs Trademark Guidelines.",
