    "Description": "Many developers seem to have a fanatic obsession with monospace fonts and using them to make their blogs look “cool”. I won’t call out anyone’s blog specifically, but you don’t have to look to hard to find some. As an example theme using a monospace font by default, look at hugo-theme-terminal, which has over 2,400 stars on GitHub. If you have a blog or are thinking about starting one, and you are writing mostly prose (you probably are), I have one suggestion for you about fonts:\nDo not use monospace fonts for prose.",
