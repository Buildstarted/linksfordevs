    "Timestamp": "2021-05-05T07:05:42",
    "Domain": "arxiv.org",
    "Description": "Law at large underpins modern society, codifying and governing many aspects\nof citizens' daily lives. Oftentimes, law is subject to interpretation, debate\nand challenges throughout various courts and jurisdictions. But in some other\nareas, law leaves little room for interpretation, and essentially aims to\nrigorously describe a computation, a decision procedure or, simply said, an\nalgorithm. Unfortunately, prose remains a woefully inadequate tool for the job.\nThe lack of formalism leaves room for ambiguities; the structure of legal\nstatutes, with many paragraphs and sub-sections spread across multiple pages,\nmakes it hard to compute the intended outcome of the algorithm underlying a\ngiven text; and, as with any other piece of poorly-specified critical software,\nthe use of informal language leaves corner cases unaddressed. We introduce\nCatala, a new programming language that we specifically designed to allow a\nstraightforward and systematic translation of statutory law into an executable\nimplementation. Catala aims to bring together lawyers and programmers through a\nshared medium, which together they can understand, edit and evolve, bridging a\ngap that often results in dramatically incorrect implementations of the law. We\nhave implemented a compiler for Catala, and have proven the correctness of its\ncore compilation steps using the F* proof assistant. We evaluate Catala on\nseveral legal texts that are algorithms in disguise, notably section 121 of the\nUS federal income tax and the byzantine French family benefits; in doing so, we\nuncover a bug in the official implementation. We observe as a consequence of\nthe formalization process that using Catala enables rich interactions between\nlawyers and programmers, leading to a greater understanding of the original\nlegislative intent, while producing a correct-by-construction executable\nspecification reusable by the greater software ecosystem."
