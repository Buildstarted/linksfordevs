His professional interests include functional programming, object-oriented development, as well as software development in general. Apart from writing two books, he has also written numerous articles and blog posts about related topics. Despite being a mostly .NET developer, Mark takes most of his inspiration from sources across a wide range of technologies, including Haskell and lots of pattern books. Originally poised to become a rock star or (failing that) graphic novelist (in the European tradition) he one day found himself with insufficient talent for either, a master's degree in Economics, and a desire for working with computers. He has been doing the latter intermittently since 1995. &nbsp; Mark is the author of two books so far: Author of  as well as . &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [4:55] Mark talks about the thought process behind writing Code That Fits In Your Head. [10:10] Why doesn’t Mark like software projects? [13:06] Yes, we want to create value for the businesses when we write code, but we also have to have a longer view on things as well. [17:11] Mark shares three of the most things for getting started with a new application. [19:46] Mark walks us through the process of automating a build. [22:42] Most compiler warnings indicate that you have problems with your code. [28:29] What are some of Mark’s resources and pieces of advice for younger programmers? [35:31] In Denmark and Scandinavian cultures, you often feel like the CEO is within close reach and someone that you could easily have lunch with. Mark talks about overcoming resistance in long-time developers when learning something new that may cause some anxiety or insecurity. &nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  — New video podcast!
