In their posts, Chris and Alejandra mention 10 bits as the absolute minimum, since there are only 765 possible game states. This number, however, takes mirroring and rotations into account1, while Chris‚Äô and Alejandra‚Äôs solutions do not. If you include mirrorings and rotations, the number of states jumps to 5477 that gives us a theoretical minimum of \\(\\left\\lceil{\\log_2{5477}}\\right\\rceil=\\left\\lceil{12.419...}\\right\\rceil=13\\) bits. For physicists, the difference between 13 and 15 might look negligible, but hey, consuming 15% more space is no joke.
