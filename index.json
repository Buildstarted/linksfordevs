When Max\nand I started working on the compute cluster of our lab in earnest, we\nwanted a lightweight monitoring solution that would be easy to set up,\nleaving us room to grow. After evaluating existing solutions, I decided\nto go with Munin, a lightweight\nserver–client set of monitoring plugins. These notes provide some\ndetails about how to set it up and easily gain access to warnings."
