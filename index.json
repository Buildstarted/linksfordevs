    "Description": "RJJ Software's Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software's Podcasting Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.\r\n\r\n Show Notes \"So a lot of these features are new features that probably weren't there when you first made your package. But I'd like to just briefly talk through what each of these are and talk about how to fix them. So before jumping into the complexity of those red Xs, let's just take a little step back and talk about how to edit what appears in a NuGet package. Because it might be a little bit confusing for someone who's brand new.\"— Scott Harden\r\n\r\n Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am not your host: Jamie. I'm Delilah and I will be recording the intro for this episode because Jamie is suffering with a throat infection.\r\n\r\n In this episode, Scott Harden joined us for the final part in a special three part series. This final part of our conversation takes the major points from the previous two episodes and applies them specifically to authoring NuGet packages.\r\n\r\n We start by discussing what NuGet packages are, cover the NuGet Package Explorer (which you can run in your browser, by the way), and finally wrap everything up by taking a look at a PR that Scott had provided for one of Jamie's open-source packages: OWASP Headers.Core.\r\n\r\n \"So in this case, it's like, well, okay, what icon do we use? A lot of developers are like, 'I'm a programmer. I'm not a graphic designer.' But—I just want to encourage everyone. It doesn't matter. First of all, no one's downloading your NuGet package because you're a graphic designer. Some of the most popular NuGet packages have really, really, really simple icons. And I'm not going to call any by name but it's kind of a joke where a lot of people make a really simple one-off icon when their project gets small and they kind of feel like they can never change it later because the project got big, so you have a lot of really great projects with really simple icons, so don't be intimidated by that\"— Scott Harden\r\n\r\n Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.\r\n\r\n My voice was created using Generative AI.\r\n\r\n Supporting the Show If you find this episode useful in any way, please consider supporting the show by either leaving a review (check our review page for ways to do that), sharing the episode with a friend or colleague, buying the host a coffee, or considering becoming a Patron of the show.\r\n\r\n Full Show Notes The full show notes, including links to some of the things we discussed and a full transcription of this episode, can be found at:  https://dotnetcore.show/season-7/modern-net-nuget-packaging-with-scott-harden\r\n\r\n Scott's Links:  scottplot.net swharden.com GitHub LinkedIn  Jamie's Public NuGet Packages:  OwaspHeaders.Core ClackMiddleware OnionArch.Mvc  Useful Links   Package authoring best practices licenses.nuget.org SPDX License List Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub Scott's PR for OwaspHeaders.Core: \"Improve NuGet package metadata\" Inkscape  ScottPlot.NET:  GitHub NuGet scottplot.net The charts that Scott was referring to when talking about downloads per day, can be seen here  Supporting the show:  Leave a rating or review Buy the show a coffee Become a patron  Getting in Touch:  Via the contact page Joining the Discord  Remember to rate and review the show on  Apple Podcasts, Podchaser, or wherever you find your podcasts, this will help the show's audience grow.

Reward hacking exists because RL environments are often imperfect, and it is fundamentally challenging to accurately specify a reward function.\nWith the rise of language models generalizing to a broad spectrum of tasks and RLHF becomes a de facto method for alignment training, reward hacking in RL training of language models has become a critical practical challenge. Instances where the model learns to modify unit tests to pass coding tasks, or where responses contain biases that mimic a user’s preference, are pretty concerning and are likely one of the major blockers for real-world deployment of more autonomous use cases of AI models.",
