Among other things, I spent my day putting off writing the final APFS encryption blog post by pursuing another one of my New Year goals.  Along the way, I wrote a Fletcher64 hashing function that can validate APFS objects at over 31 GiB/s on my 2017 iMac Pro. Rather than fighting my procrastination, I decided it would be better to share my findings. Given that my chosen learning path was directly relevant to APFS, I‚Äôm counting this as a valid APFS Advent Challenge post (and you can‚Äôt stop me!).  I hope you enjoy this brief detour into the dark arts of cross-platform SIMD programming.\n\n",
