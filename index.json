    "Description": "So you're interested in heading down the people management path in an engineering manager role? Well...\n\nYou won't like it. It's sooooo much work. Trust me, you'd be better at something else. We'll talk about it when you're a senior or principal.\n\nDoes any of that sound familiar? Why the HECK are managers gatekeeping the EM role?! Let's talk about it.\n\nAs with all livestreams, I'm looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.\r\n\r\n----\r\nüîë Membership & Subscriptions:\n- üì® Weekly Newsletter: https://weekly.devleader.ca\n- üèòÔ∏è Private Discord Community: https://sidestack.io/devleader\n\nüß† Courses:\n- All Courses: https://www.devleader.ca/courses\n- Get Promoted As A Software Engineer: https://dometrain.com/course/career-getting-promoted-as-a-software-engineer/?ref=nick-cosentino\n- Nailing The Behavioral Interview: https://dometrain.com/course/career-nailing-the-behavioral-interview/?ref=nick-cosentino\n- Getting Started with C#: https://dometrain.com/course/getting-started-csharp?ref=nick-cosentino\n- Deep dive C#: https://dometrain.com/course/deep-dive-csharp?ref=nick-cosentino\n- C# Zero to Hero BUNDLE: https://dometrain.com/bundle/from-zero-to-hero-csharp/?ref=nick-cosentino\n- Reflection in .NET: https://dometrain.com/course/from-zero-to-hero-reflection-in-dotnet/?ref=nick-cosentino\n- Refactoring For C# Devs: https://dometrain.com/course/from-zero-to-hero-refactoring-for-csharp-developers?ref=nick-cosentino\n- [FREE] Intro to Software Development: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzATctVhnsggb3lj53T8fJSK6LJQFUyKS\r\n\r\nüó£Ô∏è Social Media & Links:\r\n- All My Links: https://linktr.ee/devleader\r\n- Vlogs: @DevLeaderBTS @CodeCommute \r\n- Blog: https://www.devleader.ca/\r\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@devleader\r\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickcosentino\r\n- Threads: https://threads.net/@dev.leader\r\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/DevLeaderCa\r\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DevLeaderCa\r\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dev.leader\r\n- GitHub: https://github.com/ncosentino/\r\n- Twitch: https://twitch.tv/devleaderca\r\n- YouTube: https://youtube.com/@DevLeader?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\n‚ù§Ô∏è Affiliations & Products/Services That I Love:\r\n-  @BrandGhostAI for all of my content creation: https://brandghost.ai\r\n- AI shorts helper @opusclip : https://opus.pro/?via=2f9e97\r\n- VPS hosting from RackNerd: https://my.racknerd.com/aff.php?aff=9013\r\n- VPS hosting from Contabo: https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-101028632-12454592\r\n- Newsletter platform ConvertKit: https://convertkit.com/?lmref=c5X7KQ\r\n- Newsletter referral system SparkLoop: https://dash.sparkloop.app/signup?aff=9fe76c8b\r\n----\r\n#ama #askmeanything #softwareengineering #softwareengineer",
