But even raddbg takes ~2 seconds to execute 10000 iterations of a simple loop with conditional breakpoints inside. For comparison, the same loop without breakpoints takes less than 1ms. So why is it so damn slow?\nLet’s explore how conditional breakpoints are typically implemented in modern debuggers, where the performance problems come from and what can be done to make things go fast.",
