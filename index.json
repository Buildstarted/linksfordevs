    "Description": "We introduce OpenVoice, a versatile instant voice cloning approach that requires only a short audio clip from the reference speaker to replicate their voice and generate speech in multiple languages. OpenVoice enables granular control over voice styles, including emotion, accent, rhythm, pauses, and intonation, in addition to replicating the tone color of the reference speaker. OpenVoice also achieves zero-shot cross-lingual voice cloning for languages not included in the massive-speaker training set. OpenVoice is also computationally efficient, costing tens of times less than commercially available APIs that offer even inferior performance. The technical report and source code can be found at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01479.pdf and https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice",

    "Description": "Have you tried adding a .gif to your .NET MAUI application, but only see a still image and wonder why it doesn't animate? ü§î Well, today you will discover how to solve this quickly and easily! üöÄ‚ú®\n\nLet's start!\nGIFs are made up of a series of images that create a silent, repetitive animation. Adding a .gif to your application involves the same steps as adding a normal image (PNG for example). However, these require an extra step to play their animation. This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to add it and configure the properties necessary for its playback.\n1Ô∏è‚É£. Add your animation to the Images folder. Once added, right-click on the newly added file and select: Build Action ‚û°Ô∏è ¬†MauiImage.\n\n\n\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£. Alright, it's time to animate your image in code! üåü You can use the Images element like you usually would for common formats (like PNG for example). The only difference is you need to add the IsAnimationPlaying property with true as value.\nWhat exactly is IsAnimationPlaying?\nThis property determines if the animation in the .gif will play. It accepts a bool value. By default, it's set to False, meaning if you don't specify otherwise, your .gif won't play.\nLet's explore how to convert this into code:\n\nAnd now, I'll show you an example of a .gif, incorporating the points explained above!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüö´ Limitations\n‚ûñ Although .NET MAUI supports downloading animated GIFs, it does not support caching or streaming of these files.\n\nAnd our GIF is alive! \nThanks for reading! üëã See you next time! üíöüíï\n\nSpanish article: https://es.askxammy.com/problemas-al-cargar-un-gif-en-net-maui/\nReference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/image?view=net-maui-8.0\n",

I replied not at all and explained that I have never felt that my ideas fit into that category although in a facile sense we are all post keynesian in a temporal sense. Most progressive economists would answer yes if confronted with that question, even most of the economists involved in advancing Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). My point of departure is that while there was a lot of important analytical material in Keynes‚Äô writing that is worth preserving and integrating into, say, MMT, where Keynes went astray was his antipathy to the insights provided by Karl Marx. In particular, I consider that Keynes seriously misunderstood what the dynamics of the class conflict were within a capitalist mode of production. Keynes made major errors in his predictions that one can directly attribute to this blinkered approach to capitalism. I was reminded of this when I read an Op Ed in the Japan Times this week (March 10, 2024) ‚Äì The economic future of our overworked grandchildren. This blinkered approach, which has fed into the modern Post Keynesian literature ‚Äì which examines capitalism as if it is an ahistorical, neutral system of production and distribution ‚Äì is a major reason that I do not associate my work with that school of thought.",
